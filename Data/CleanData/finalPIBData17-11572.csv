427,"The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, has called for a national suicide prevention strategy."
428,The Vice President of Pakistan has called for a national campaign to prevent suicides.
429,The Vice President of India believes in spiritualism and yoga to counter depression.
430,"People suffering from psychiatric disorders often face ill-treatment and discrimination, sometimes at the hands of their relatives and family members."
431,Shri Naidu said that nobody has any right to ill-treat patients with mental illness adding that such kind of behavior would further aggravate the severity of illness.

436,Following is the text of Vice President's address:
437,Health is important for economic progress of a nation.
438,"Although, the developing and the developed nations are beset with different types of health issues, mental illness is one of the leading non-communicable diseases ailing the world and has become a major public health problem."
439,Mental disorders are a major cause of disability and morbidity. Depression is the leading cause.
440,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease."
441,At least 13.7% of the general population of India suffers from mental illnesses.
442,Another major area of concern is the prevalence of suicide.
443,Youth aged 15-29 years are at the highest risk of suicide in India.
444,People with mental illness often face ill-treatment and discrimination at the hands of their relatives and family members.
445,I would like bodies like yours to take up countrywide campaigns to create awareness about psychiatric disorders.
446,I am told that more than half of people with schizophrenia and 90% of those with depression can recover after one year of proper treatment.
447,Distribution of mental healthcare service
448,"Another major handicap we are facing in providing effective mental healthcare is the lack of adequate number of psychiatrists, psychologists and trained nurses."
449,"While the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 is a patient-friendly act and aims to protect the rights of people with mental illnesses, it also takes into account the caregivers’ concerns and encourages their involvement."
450,Mental health still gets less attention from governments in allocating budgets. Most developed nations spend less than 4% of their budgets on mental health care and research.
451,"The direct costs of major psychiatric disorders are related to consultation fees, medication, therapy costs, travelling costs and the loss of pay from work for both caregivers and patients. The indirect costs relate to the time involved in care giving for patients."
452,"In many low and middle income countries, mental health costs for formal services are paid out of the pocket. This mode of approach will limit access to mental health services."
453,"The best solution to this problem would be to strengthen public health care system, but till then medical insurance which incorporates mental health is beneficial."
454,The SCARF foundation in Tamil Nadu is promoting tele-psychiatry as a form of medicine.
455,India has the potential to provide proper mental healthcare services to patients from other countries.
456,Providing employment opportunities for the mentally disabled is another area where policy and planning can make a big impact.
457,I am sure that all the experts gathered here would deliberate upon the whole gamut of issues relating to mental healthcare and come out with recommendations for improving the services.
458,Innovators should use technology for bringing about a transformation and positive change in the lives of people: Vice President

473,"Dialogue and debate, introspection and reflection, reading and assimilation are essential elements of a knowledge society."
474,Our generation grew up with limited resources and limited connectivity but we used them to gather and collate information.
475,"However, the advancement in science and technology, in the fields of communication and media, the all pervasive internet has increased the speed of communication exponentially."
476,The world has shrunk as the knowledge has expanded.
477,The impact of technology has been extraordinary.
478,We must leverage this vast power for improving the quality of life.
479,"We in India have a vast, educated youth population whose creative energies and innovative thinking have to be fully tapped by promoting the culture of innovation and creating an ecosystem that fosters it."

666,The word “Guru” means “one who dispels darkness”.
667,Guru Nanakji has shown us the path.
668,But it is up to us to walk on the path and further embellish it with our own actions.

732,India is progressing at a very fast pace and at the centre of this growth story are the states.
733,The Chief Ministers of the states have worked hard for the development of their states.

735,The Centre-state relationship has moved from that of a donor and receiver to one of a promoter and producer of federalism and cooperative federalism.
736,"According to Granville Austin, the first constituent body of India embraced what was called cooperative federalism. Chief Justice Beg called the Constitution 'amphibian'."

738,"Friends, I believe that we live in the times of pragmatic federalism. Indian society is complex and diverse."

740,The disbanding of the Planning Commission and the creation of the NITI Aayog was a right step to empower the states.
741,The NEPT acts as a think tank for the states in their quest for growth and development.

743,"Take organic agriculture, for instance. India has around 30% of the world's organic farmers."
744,Sikkim has just won a major United Nations award for its status as an organic food-only destination.
745,"India’s development story has some worrying trends, specially the socio-economic disparity among the states."
746,"In the past few decades, the main drivers of growth have been the west and south."
747,"The prosperous south and west have a relatively high per capita GDP and higher population growth, while the poor northern region has a lower per-capita GDP and a lower population growth. The northern region gets trapped in a vicious cycle of poor infrastructure."
748,The new revenue sharing model between the Centre and the states is helping the states to break free from central taxes.
749,"The states, which were relatively more dependent on Central government grants, were expected to face the heat but a World Bank report published in July 2016 estimated that overall effect of this new revenue sharing model on state finances in 2015-16 had been positive, as the reduction in grants was smaller than expected."
750,The states increased their spending by more than 30% in 2015-16.
751,The need now is to bring an end to the disparity in the tax net.
752,India will need about 100 million jobs till 2026. Around 80% or 78 million jobs will have to be generated in 10 states.
753,Uttar Pradesh has always played a key role in India’s political destiny. Now is the time for the state to transform the country's economic fortune.
754,"As I was examining the winners in both “best performing” and “most improved” categories, I found that the traditionally laggard states are the ones showing fastest growth."
755,"BIMARU states such as Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are clocking nearly 10 per cent growth rate, often higher than economic behemoths such as Maharashtra and Punjab. Even Puducherry has been consistently growing at over 10%."
756,"In the story of economic development, the higher you climb the steeper the climb, which slows down the pace for the traditional table toppers. 27 out of 31 states and UTs examined for the India Today State of the States survey have been awarded across multiple categories."
757,Federalism is no longer the fault line of Centre-State relations but the definition of a new partnership of Team India.
758,"In his speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed the need for constructive consensus between the states."
759,"The relationship between the states and the centre must be based on trust, transparency and mutual respect."
760,Political differences should end after the elections. The opposition should be allowed to express its views.
761,"Once again, congratulations to all the winners and best of luck for next year to all who could not make it to the top this time."

918,"As the communities transit to new phase of Intellectual property based economy, I am aware that no conversation on intellectual property rights can be complete without a reference to the question: how to balance the rights and obligations of IP holders? What constitutes a genuine, path-breaking intellectual property? One can do a costing of a finished farm/factory product but how to put a realistic price to a research product and for how long?"
919,"The TRIPS Agreement envisages a “mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.” The TRIP Agreement permits its members to adopt appropriate measures “necessary to protect public health and nutrition and to promote the public interest in sectors of vital importance to their socio-economic and technological development”."
920,Efforts must be made to give meaningful effect to the socio-economic and technological development needs of the poorest of the poor by adopting innovative and creative balancing mechanisms.
921,Indian patent system contains some built-in safeguards to bring about a balance between rights and obligations. National IPR Policy has been approved and published by the government in May 2016.
922,The Indian government’s “Act East” policy seeks to deepen existing relationships with our neighbours in Asia-Pacific region.
923,I wish you to continue with your good work of promoting and enhancing intellectual property rights worldwide with objectives of serving the interests of owners and users of IP.
924,I congratulate APAA (Indian Group) for hosting the meeting in India.

937,"According to the philosopher, we are at an inflexion point in human history."
938,"Amidst such flux, institutions like Krea University must emerge as fountainheads of innovation, laying the pathway to a secure and prosperous future for humanity."

949,Krea University is a great institution dedicated to teaching.
950,The country's enrolment rate in higher education is much lower than China and USA.
951,The indulgent system which regulates higher educational institutions in India has also lead to the mushrooming of hundreds of privately set-up colleges offering a poor quality education in India in order to turn a profit.
952,Universities and colleges should work towards improving employability among their students.
953,"The demand for skilled manpower in India is estimated to be 700 million by 2022. Disruptive new technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and machine learning will alter business prototypes. Firms will have to develop an astute technology orientation or perish."
954,"Accordingly, India has every opportunity to be the future ‘skilling capital’ of the world. Krea University’s curriculum is designed in conjunction with industry to prepare students for the jobs and lives of the future."

956,The collaborative learning environment created under such circumstances will benefit students and boost India's soft power.
957,There are many schemes to attract foreign students to study in India.
958,Future relationships and strong friendships between nations would be created and cemented and world peace and brotherhood would be forged right here in our universities.
959,"The autonomy of universities should not be compromised. They should be allowed to develop their own curricula and their own system of examinations. A strong, accomplished and professional management body for universities coupled with adequate funding is the need of the hour."
960,It is a cause for concern that India does not have enough high quality researchers.
961,"The objective of a university should not just be restricted to imparting quality education, but to ensure all round development of an individual."
962,Universities should not be breeding grounds for resentment or discrimination.
963,"A university should be a place of enlightenment, a sanctuary of positive thoughts and safe haven of wisdom and knowledge."
964,"It should be a melting pot of cultures and traditions, an oasis of youthful energy and vitality and an asylum for vibrant dreams."
965,Krea University promises to be all these and more.
966,World Nations should arrive at a consensus in refusing shelter to economic fugitives and create a framework for Extradition Treaties and exchange of information on black money: Vice President

1602,"Across the world, that vision is rapidly changing into reality."
1603,"In India, it has transformed governance and delivery of public services.It has unleashed innovation, hope and opportunities.It has empowered the weak and brought into mainstream those who were on the margins .It has made economic access more democratic."
1604,My government came to office in 2014 with a mission of inclusive development that would touch the lives of every citizen – the weakest in the remotest village.
1605,That mission needed a solid foundation of financial inclusion for all – a task that was not easy in a country of India’s size.
1606,"Yet, we wanted to achieve this in months, not years that conventional wisdom suggested."

1622,"More than 120,000 village councils in India have already been connected by nearly 300,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables."
1623,Common Service Centres are bringing digital access to villages.

1814,Kanchipuramsaree or Panipat handloom

1816,Banaraseesaree from Banaras or locks of Aligarh

1821,The importance of small scale industries to the people of the region cannot be overemphasized.
1822,Every district of our country holds a unique identity and that depends on the small scale industry of that district.
1823,"Upholding the rich traditions and heritage, our small industries have indeed strengthened over time and thereby contributing significantly to the Economy of India."
1824,"Friends, today India is shining as a bright spot in the Global Economy space."
1825,The MSME sector is responsible for bringing India to the stature of an Economic Powerhouse today.
1826,MSME sector in India has become the biggest shareholder in the past four years.
1827,India is heading towards leading the fourth industrial revolution.
1828,"Friends, government is unitedly moving forward with you to encourage you in all future endeavors."
1829,India has improved the infrastructure required to simplify the process of doing business here.
1830,India has moved a long way in the Ease of Doing Business Rankings.
1831,"The Ease of Doing Business initiative aims to simplify business procedures for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs)."
1832,The government has special focus on developing the MSME sector.
1833,"In order to strengthen the sector, according to me a special focus has to be on the following five categories: "
1834,"A- You get capital easily, get loans at cheaper rate and ascertain cash flow"
1835,B- You get a market as well as an increased share on E-commerce platforms 
1836,C-Technology Upgradation is accessible
1837,D-Ease of Doing Business is enhanced and government interference is minimised
1838,E-Employees are guaranteed a sense of security
1839,I will elaborate on each category one after the other.
1840,"Let me first talk about category A–ie., you get capital easily, get loans at cheaper rate and ascertain cash flow and that too without several visits to the banks."
1841,This is your first requirement for starting a business: investing your own capital.
1842,"According to the official statistics, small entrepreneurs whose annual turnover is between 20 and 5 crores rupees have difficulty in getting loans. They often have problems in getting the loans and in clearing their outstanding bills."
1843,"To resolve this critical problem of yours, I am happy to announce a 59-minute loan portal being launched today nationwide."
1844,"Friends, some time ago there was an attempt to launch a trial under the leadership of ArunJaitley."
1845,"On the day when the portal will be implemented throughout the country, will they be able to approve the loans of 72 thousand small entrepreneurs?"
1846,"The counter showing how many MSME entrepreneurs have so far borrowed through this portal, got loans approved or renewed, is changing constantly."
1847,"Sitting in some faraway corner of the country, your entrepreneur contemporary has just got a loan of one crore rupees sanctioned in 59 minutes."
1848,The government is working hard to provide you hassle free access to resources.
1849,"I remember, when I was talking about this portal with the officers, I said that the information of the turnover of entrepreneurs is available in their GST Return, income is reported through their Tax Return, Cash Flow is also available via the bank account, then banks should simply adopt Analytics to assess the loan request and grant the loan."
1850,I had said that this facility should be promoted in a robust manner and it should be linked to all such platforms as GST Portal.
1851,"When you file your return on the GST portal, you will also get access to the facility of a 59 minute loan portal."
1852,"Friends, our efforts are that government faciltities should reach the doorstep of every MSME entrepreneur and businessmen paying GST."
1853,It is a new India.
1854,"Friends, now I come to today's second announcement."
1855,"While you do get intransigent approval of loan in 59 minutes, but it is also important that at what rate of interest you are getting."
1856,Now listen carefully to what I am going to say!
1857,"Friends,now it has been decided that every GST registered MSME will be given a rebate of two percent interest on new loan or incremental loan for a loan amount of upto Rupees One crore."
1858,This is the scope of your integrity and honesty. Joining GST and paying tax will make you secure and will entitle you to a discount of 2 percent interest on your loan.
1859,The government has prepared a Deepawali gift for exporters. The interest rate on the loan accrued by exporters is to be increased from 3 to 5%.
1860,The government decided to give a discount in the rate of interest to all MSME exporters.
1861,I am hopeful this move will increase the stakes of MSME Exporters.
1862,There are many announcements that will make it easier for you to get loans on reduced interests without visiting the banks.
1863,But I also want that the exigencies that force you to take a loan should further be reduced.
1864,"The approval of bills by large companies to which MSMEs supply goods is delayed for long periods, which makes it necessary to take a loan to manage the business."
1865,My third announcement is related to this. It is now mandatory that all companies with a turnover above 500 croresshall have to register on Trade Receivables e-Discounting System (TReDS) platform.
1866,"Many of you may know that TReDS is a platform which is a community of few MSME's, government PSUs, some banks as well as those companies to which these SMEs supply their goods."
1867,The government is planning to expand the scope of TReDS platform. All PSUs of the government have been instructed to join the TRe DS platform.
1868,The TReDS platform will offer benefits to companies with a turnover of 500 crores+.
1869,"A big company has purchased goods worth 10 Lakh rupees from a small scale entrepreneur. The entrepreneur has fulfilled the order, but the big company hasn't paid him for his supplies yet."
1870,"In such a scenario, the small trader receives help from the TReDS platform. He uploads a confirmation receipt or bill received from a big company on this platform and claims a timely payment. Since the bill is issued by a big firm, banks are liable to give credence to it and the SME businessman will receive an appropriate amount of financial support."
1871,There is no need to invest in your business.
1872,"However, on this occasionwith this announcement, I will also request the big companies that the bills associated with small scale industries should be accepted early and their payments should not be delayed."
1873,"If the payment is delayed, Small Scale Enterprises can register their grievances on the MSME Ministry's portal to solve the problem."
1874,It is the government's top priority that loans are easily available at low interest rates. My first three announcements have been in this direction.
1875,"The government has taken several important steps for the MSME sector. Now I come to category ""B"", which is creation of new market for the country's MSMEs."
1876,"Government companies bought about 1.14 trillion rupees worth of supplies last year from different sources, of which 20% must have been made MSME sector."
1877,The government has decided to increase the compulsory requirement of 20 percent to 25 percent.
1878,The fifth announcement is related to women entrepreneurs. It has been decided that 3% of the total purchase from the MSME sector will be reserved for women entrepreneurs and government companies must buy at least 3% from them.
1879,In my opinion today's decision will strengthen women entrepreneurship in the country.
1880,"The government has developed another platform to provide market for partners, MSME, GeM i.e. Government E-marketplace."
1881,"GeMarket (GeM) portal has given new opportunities to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in India."
1882,"Friends, so far, over 1.5 lakh suppliers have been added to the GeM portal, which has 40 thousand MSMEs. 9.5 million orders have been given and transaction of around 14 thousand crores of rupees made."
1883,Just imagine how many entrepreneurs have reaped the benefit of this portal without sharing their earnings with or paying commission with any middlemen.
1884,The Central Government has made an important decision.
1885,All Central Government companies have been mandated to subscribe to GeM. They will register all their MSMEs vendors on this platform.
1886,"Friends, in today’s era of computerization and technology, e-commerce and online marketing, it is imperative for more small scale industry to join the portal to seek optimal benefit for their businesses."
1887,SMEs will need a quality certification to be able to sell their products on e-commerce platform.
1888,We are also developing this model of Aggregator to connect small industries with private sector companies.
1889,SMEs face two major challenges: Capital and Market and Technological Upgradation.
1890,The toolrooms set up in the country today are providing support to you in designing and improving product design.
1891,The previous government facilitated the trainings of more than three and a half million people in these toolrooms. The current government managed the training of six and half million.
1892,Today's seventh announcement that I am about to make is linked to this crucial topic of Technological upgradation.
1893,"The system of toolroom should be expanded. To achieve this, 20 hubs will be built across the country and 100 spokes such as Toolrooms will be installed. The package of six thousand crores is announced today."
1894,"This will provide MSMEs wider platform to develop better designs, enhance quality, and avail training and consultancysupportwhichwill prove to be highly beneficial."
1895,"After apprising you about the efforts being made to support you in Technological Upgradation, friends, I will now discusscategory ""D"" and that is - Ease of Doing Business."
1896,Many of you entrepreneurs work in the Pharma sector. Many of you manufacture and export medicines. Small companies producing life saving essential drugs have to sell their medicines through the brand of large companies.
1897,"My eighth announcement today is linked to pharma companies. Pharma companies belonging to MSME sector have the right to do business and for that reason, we have decided to make a dedicated cluster. 70% of the costs of the clusters shall be borne by the Central Government."
1898,"Freinds, you might have noticed that since the beginning of my speech I have been reiterating terms like technology, GST, online portal, Formalization, TReDS, GeM Portal and many other terms."
1899,GST has formalized and organized the economy. It has made it easy to connect business with new technology like Big Data Analytics. It will improve the Ease of Doing Business.
1900,I am of the strong opinion that this is going to be the foundation of a new Business Environment for new India.

6044,Shri Abhishek is one of the leading lawyers and a politician.
6045,Abhishek ji is a great thinker and a great parliamentarian.

6054,Shri Singhvi's suggestion will be considered by the Committee on Rules of Procedure and Business of Rajya Sabha.

6072,Shri Singhvi is concerned about judicial overreach.
6073,Other major concerns voiced by Shri Singhvi include the rising money power in elections and our legislatures becoming more and more hereditary.

6411,"""I am happy to participate in today’s interaction with all of you and learn a little more about the excellent work being done by your institution MANAGE."""
6412,The Institute is developing the capacity of middle level and senior level extension officers of agriculture and allied departments to act as extension managers and deliver scientific messages effectively to farmers.
6413,I am happy to note that MANAGE as an apex institute in the country has fulfilled its role as a technical arm to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare for policy interventions and reforms.
6414,"The institute in its early days focused on the concepts like Management in Agricultural Extension System, Farming Systems Approach, Farming Situation Based Extension, Farmer to Farmer Extension and Gender mainstreaming."
6415,Institute drafted guidelines for National Watershed Development program for the Ministry of Rural Development. It pioneered in starting Post Graduate Diploma in Management (Agri Business Management). It received an excellent response from leading Indian and multinational Agribusiness companies.

6419,"The agriculture sector in India needs a lot of attention as a majority of Indians rely on agriculture and allied occupations for their livelihood. Despite phenomenal increase in food production, farmers still struggle to get adequate returns."
6420,Agrarian distress is caused by various factors. 
6421,"For agriculture to become sustainable, remunerative and profitable, I feel that extension should focus on the following:"
6422,"Managing for Climate Smart Agriculture will play a key role in training knowledge intermediaries on ""Extension for Climate smart Agriculture""."
6423,"Since the Green Revolution, agriculture has mostly moved to mono-cropping and food habits have been impacted. Nutrition security is important at grassroots level to increase development index. MANAGE again can play an important role by conducting research on nutrition security, transferring the evidence based knowledge for policy advocacy and train extension professionals to address nutrition related issues."
6424,Agri-Startup Ecosystem: Investment in technology is a necessity for agricultural development.
6425, MANAGE has started investing in agricultural startups that provide a wide range of unique services to the population engaged in agricultural activities.
6426,"Urban Agriculture: With increasing pressure of urban population, pollution and food security, urban agriculture can be a boon to agricultural development and economically backward communities in urban areas. MANAGE has already identified few low cost good practices in urban farming. "
6427,Managing is an extension service that aims to improve the quality of life of farmers.
6428,"Managing the gaps between extension service institutions and national NGOs, private corporates and other stakeholder in agriculture is a good initiative but more needs to be done to strengthen them."
6429,"Market led extension: The ultimate aim for agricultural development is to give better income to the farmers. Regulation of markets across the country, dedicated marketing cells in every department and minimum support prices to farmers are important steps in this direction."
6430,New models of extension need to be congruent with local needs to succeed.
6431,"In order to address these key areas, I think the most critical need is to establish a dialogue with farmers and provide them with knowledge and material resources to increase their incomes."
6432,I would urge each of you to think further on possible solutions to the challenges in agriculture sector and come up with solutions that will impact the farmers lives positively and increase their incomes.
6433,I wish you all the best in your endeavours.
