69,All such forms of Indian art and music form part of our rich culture and play a key role in unifying the country and its’ people.

75,The vast treasure of Indian musical forms needs to be nurtured and propagated. Brahma Gana Sabha should encourage more and more younger artistes to express their talent.

79,NRIs come to the December Art Festival to see the cultural activities of Indian Diaspora.

84,"The Narada Brahma and many other Nada Brahmas have enriched the world of music and left an impression on our inner consciousness.

Had anyone thought four years ago that India's ranking of ease of doing business would improve from 142 to 77 and that India was moving rapidly towards becoming one of the countries in top 50? Four years ago, had anyone thought that more number of people would be travelling by flights than by AC trains? Four years ago, had anyone ever thought that the rickshaw pullers, vegetable vendors and tea-sellers too would be using the BHIM app and would enhance their self-esteem by having Rupay debit cards in their pockets?"
739,"Four years ago, there were 450 airplanes operational since independence. Now there are plans to order 1000 new airplanes in a year."

758,There was a lot of discussion during 2013-14 over whether 10 or 12 gas cylinders should be provided to every household.
759,Just imagine!Elections were being contested over whether 10 cylinders must be provided or 12 while half the population of India did not even have gas connections.
760,The government is working to come up with permanent solutions to the problems that are plaguing the country. IBC is one of them.
761,"There was a tradition when it came to taking loans. If a poor person or a person from the middle class family used to take a loan of more than Rs.1lakh, he or she couldn't escape from it. There were many companies that took loans of not Rs.5-10lakh but much more."
762,"However, when these companies used to suffered losses and couldn't repay the loans to the banks, the owners of these companies used to escape easily."
763,The same system continued for 70 years since independence. The reason is because the companies had a protective shield to prevent the banks from carrying out investigations. The companies did not have to repay the money taken from the banks.
764,"After 2016, companies that used to take loans of thousands of crores and didn't repay them have started repaying them."

776,"Today the system of GST is properly in place to a great extent. It is aimed at bringing 99% of the things under the tax net of 18% or less. After that, only a few luxurious items will be taxed beyond 18%."
777,I and my government's vision is clear. The country with the largest youth population can never have a small dream or an unrealistic goal.
778,The complete system of the government and the government machinery developed over 70 years is being implemented at a rapid pace.

846,"I am in Prayagraj, India."
847,It has been said about Prayag- को कहि सकहि प्रयाग प्रभाऊ। कलुष पुंज कुंजर मृगराऊ।।
848,It is difficult to describe the impact and greatness of Prayag.
849,This time devotees will be able to see the Akshayavat after bathing in Triveni of Prayagraj.
850,Saraswati Kumbh and Akshayavat are being held together.
851,"Just moments ago, several projects worth about Rs.4500 crores were launched and foundation stone laid for making Prayagraj even more attractive and modern."
852,I congratulate Prayagraj for all the facilities created for Kumbh.
853,The BJP government is focusing on connectivity during Kumbh. The Ministry of Railways is going to start many new trains for KumbH. The government is making efforts to strengthen and improve all the roads connecting Prayagraj.
854,"After the event, I will go for the inauguration of the new terminal of Prayagraj airport."
855,The Integrated Command Control Centre set up with more than Rs.100 crores is going to be an important centre of smart Prayagraj.
856,The government is trying to get the people around the world to experience Kumbh.
857,"All efforts are being made to ensure that people visiting this place can go back with the feeling that the confluence of spirituality, faith and modernity can be so grand and unmatched!"
858,The selfie-point being created here is also a spot of attraction.
859,"The merger of Ardha-Kumbh and selfie will remain incomplete unless the confluence, Triveni, becomes magnificent."
860,The sewage treatment plant built at a cost of Rs.1700 crores will prevent a dozen of drains from flowing directly into Gangaji. Around 150 ghats are being beautified in Namami Gange project. 6 of them were inaugurated today.
861,Namami Gange Mission aimed at developing facilities along the banks of river Ganga has been launched in Uttar Pradesh.
862,The campaign to clean and uninterrupted flow of river Ganga is driven by the masses.
863,Cleanliness is an important aspect of Kumbh.

876,"The party with the longest ruling period destroyed every institution, including the constitutional bodies."
877,The people of Prayagraj and UP know why the Congress dislikes the judiciary.
878,The Prayagraj High Court has ousted them from the position in Parliament. They tried to end democracy itself. They declared emergency on the nation and tried to modify the Constitution.
879,This has been the trend of Congress leaders. They tried to destroy the neutral institutions. They used muscle power and deceit to uproot the dignity of the judiciary.
880,The Supreme Court overturned the age-old judicial tradition.
881,"The senior-most judge was appointed as the Chief Justice instead of the most senior one because they wanted to create pressure on the Judiciary. When Justice Khanna disapproved of their decision to declare emergency, his seniority was neglected."
882,They care neither for the welfare of the country nor for the democracy just because of their self-interests.
883,The judiciary in our country works by holding the Constitution of our country paramount.
884,The country has witnessed how political parties use the Judiciary to their will.
885,They are trying to scare and threaten the Judges.
886,The statement that was in news during the trial of one of their leaders was that the judge didn't want his wife to celebrate Karwa Chauth.
887,"Two days ago we saw another example of people who consider themselves higher than the country, democracy, judiciary, the people and institutions."
888,The present of the Congress is as tarnished as its past. People in Congress think only about themselves and their own self-interests and not about the nation or its people.
889,The Prasad Yojana is being implemented in several places associated with devotion and spirituality.
890,You will get a glimpse of how India is changing and how the New India is blending antiquity with modernity in Ardha-Kumbh.
891,"I urge the people of Prayag to make Kumbh a successful event by merging modernity with spirituality, development with faith and comfort with trust."
892,The government is fulfilling its responsibility.
893,"With this expectation, once again, I would like to congratulate you all and Prayagraj for the various development projects."
894,"English rendering of PM’s address at launch of various development projectsat Raebareli, UP"

896,"Today I am on the land which has shown the direction towards various fields ranging from spirituality to freedom struggle and from literature to politics in every region of the country. It is the land of asceticism of various sages and monks, including Maharishi Jamadagni. It was the land where Pandit Amol Sharma, the progenitor of the Kisan movement, was born."
897,"The Central Government and the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh are dedicated towards the development of this region. Recently, projects worth more than Rs. 1000 crores were either dedicated or their foundation stones were laid here."
898,"Before coming here, I had visited the modern coach factory nearby. This year, I got the opportunity to approve the 900th coach.

899,The coach that was manufactured in the Rae Bareli factory was made within 3 months of the BJP government coming to power. The installation of new and modern machines is being done at a fast pace.
900,"The coach factory of Rae Bareli is producing modern, lightweight and robust coaches. The capacity of the factory will increase by about 50%. It will produce metro rails and semi-high speed trains."
901,There is an expansion of the number of coaches and the coach factory in Rae Bareli. The increased capacity of the factory will increase the employment opportunities for the youth.
902,"Before 2014, goods worth less than Rs.1 crore were bought from local markets and local traders for this rail coach factory. Since 2014, the purchases worth more than  Rs.125 crores have been made from the local traders."
903,"The railway ministry and the U.P. government will construct a rail industrial park here. Through this industrial park, goods will be supplied to the rail factory and it will benefit the small and medium enterprises."
904,"The previous government had constructed a railway coach factory in Rae Bareli. It had been planned to appoint 5 thousand employees, but only half of the posts were approved. All the workers were brought from Kapurth."
905,Rae Bareli is going to be a global hub for rail coach manufacturing.
906,"In order to strengthen connectivity and improve the facilities for the people of the country, the work is going on at a rapid pace for the sectors like highways, airways, waterways and I-ways besides railways. The National Highway dedicated recently will connect Rae Bareli to Banda."
907,The government is pushing ahead with work on the AIIMS at Rae Bareli.
908,"The government has dedicated a medical college, hospital and hostel worth more than Rs.450 crores and laid the foundation stone for another hospital at Munshiganj as part of the AIIMS project in Rae Bareli. The government also handed over the keys of the houses to the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana."
909,The keys of more than 23 thousand houses have been handed over to poor families in Rae Bareli. Work on 500 more houses started recently.
910,"In the history of the country, this day is special as it marks the victory of the army of India over the forces of terror, tyranny and anarchy in 1971."
911,"In order to honor the bravery and dedication of the army, in order to glorify our protectors who are on the border in this freezing cold weather of December, you should lift your hand and with your closed fists say aloud for those brave soldiers - Bharat Mata ki Jai! Bharat Mata ki Jai! Bharat Mata ki Jai!"
912,Just imagine! The slogan of 'Bharat Mata ki Jai!' that you all are proud of is also the reason of embarrassment for some! What kind of people are they who have a problem in hailing Mother India and do not care about the country? 
913,I am aware that they want to abuse Modi.
914,Today there are two sides within the country. One side is for the truth and security of the country and is led by the government. The other side belongs to the forces that are trying to weaken the country at any cost.
915,"Today the nation is closely watching the fact that Congress, the opposition is with forces that are not allowing our armies to be strengthened."
916,There is a quatrain in Ramcharitmanas that explains Lord Ram explaining someone's personality used to say.
917,Some people have made up their minds that everything is a lie.
918,The Congress government's attitude towards the armies was wrong and the nation will never forgive them.

12620,"He was addressing the gathering after releasing the book “Human Rights, Values and Cultural Ethos” a collection of essays and lectures by Dr. R.P. Dhokalia in New Delhi today."
12621,The Vice President believes that education and media are key to promoting cultural ethos.
12622,The Vice President has said that citizens must respect others' rights.
12623,The Vice President said that the globalized world of our times needs both scientific and spiritual development.
12624,"The Vice President said that the philosophy of education is to provide for the total development of citizens, including the development of the physical, intellectual, emotional, material and spiritual aspects of their personality."
12625,"Venkaiah Naidu, Vice President of India, launched a book on human rights, values and cultural ethics."
12626,I launch this collection of essays and lectures by Dr. R.P. Dhokalia.
12627,The thrust of the book is on the connection between human rights and the intrinsic and core human values which in turn manifest in the cultural ethos of a society.
12628,"Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been the basis for the formulation of many provisions in the Constitutions of many countries around the world including India.Over the last seven decades, there has been a tremendous proliferation of laws in all countries with focus on rights of human beings."
12629,"Notwithstanding the plethora of laws recognizing human rights, there is no country in the world where these human rights are not violated in one form or another and in varying degrees."
12630,The author believes that human rights and human values are best protected when they become part of the cultural ethos.
12631,"The author believes that core human values alone can ensure civilized, good quality of human life."
12632,"Since primitive times, man has been relentless in pursuit of a good quality of worldly life and transformation in living conditions through successive periods of history. Modern technological civilization of material prosperity resulted from this pursuit."
12633,"He was a great scientist, an explorer of nature, a seeker of spiritual enlightenment and seeker of higher values."
12634,The author believes that culture is an important aspect of human existence.
12635,"Cultural ethos has to be founded, according to the author, on the bedrock of human rights, values and duties and enlightened citizenship."
12636,"A vision and a philosophy of education has, therefore, to provide for the total development of citizens, including the development of the physical, intellectual, emotional, material and spiritual aspects of their personality."
12637,"The Epilogue of this book succinctly explains the role of education in man-making,life-building and character- strengthening. Education should focus onstrengthening the cultural ethos through a teaching learning process that fosters universal ethics and moral conduct."
12638,"According to the author, the globalized world of our times needs both scientific and spiritual development."
12639,This book is a timely reminder to all of us that human rights and values should become a part of the cultural ethos and we need to incorporate these universal values into our education system.
12640,I would like to compliment the author on producing this excellent book.The theme is very relevant and the exposition is thought provoking.
12641,"Human rights are sacred.We cannot allow any system to continue if it tramples on these rights and violates them.Democracy is a system that gives respect to each individual’s rights and, therefore, is considered as the most preferred governance system all over the world now."
12642,"However, one must recognize that authoritarian tendencies, terrorist activities and lack of empowered citizenry can potentially very easily derail democracy."
12643,"Which is why eternal vigilance is required to safeguard human rights and restore human dignity to each and every person.Civil liberties are well protected when each of us respects others’ rights.As I said yesterday, citizens must be guardians of liberty of fellow citizens.Violence in any form needs to be condemned.That’s the duty of every citizen.That’s the way to reform our polity."
12644,"This is the lesson that the history of our own country teaches us through the dark chapter of emergency in the 1975-77 period as well as through the sporadic despicable incidents of violence of all kinds and atrocities, especially against women, in contemporary India."
12645,"It is a matter of great satisfaction and a source of optimism in the inner strength of all Indians that as a nation, we have risen up as a strong force against such violations of human rights, and against violence and oppression."
12646,It is not surprising that the US has condemned authoritarianism and violation of human rights. The US is a country that has valued freedom and respected each living creature including human beings.
12647,This fountain of ancient thought has been nourishing our cultural and social roots for many centuries.
12648,"This is the spring that has ensured that we remain one of the most vibrant, functioning democratic systems in the world."
12649,"This cultural ethos must be preserved, protected, propagated and nurtured further."
12650,This can be achieved not only through education but also through media and the ideal behavior of leaders in all walks of life.
12651,I see this as the essential message of this work.It is a view that reflects India’s holistic vision.It is a view that illumines the way forward.I hope it will generate new ideas for further action at various levels for improving the quality of life of each citizen in our country.

12857,The challenges today are mainly two.
12858,There are two main objectives of sustainable agriculture: to make use of scarce resources and protect the soil.
12859,The first aim is to improve the quality of life of farmers.

12867,There are three main priorities for development of farm sector in Pakistan.
12868,"Given the small size of land holdings, it is imperative that we should enhance our productivity and focus on “intensification”."
12869,"Increased productivity is possible if farmers have greater access to knowledge, technology and credit."
12870,"In order to improve farm productivity, we need to work with farmers to infuse them with knowledge and technology."
12871,"We need to bring a major shift from in Indian agriculture, moving it from a low-productivity stage to a high productive level and at the same time ensure that it is sustainable and equitable."
12872,"At the same time, diversification of crops must be promoted."
12873,"To achieve the goal of zero hunger and adequate nutrition, the country needs increased production and efficient distribution of food grains."
12874,Along with diversification we need value addition.
12875,Scientists must work with the government’s extension machinery to advise farmers on the cropping patterns and post-harvest processes and food processing technologies.
12876,Timely financial credit facilities at reasonable interest rates and farmer-friendly insurance policies are vital to boost agricultural growth.
12877,"Forecasting the seasonal conditions in advance, testing the soil and ensuring water availability will go a long way in mitigating the problems of farmers."
12878,The implementation of E- NAM needs to be further streamlined and expedited to help farmers who rely on local markets.
12879,Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) act needs to be amended by introducing single-point levy of market fee across a state and a unified single trading license.
12880,"In many of our policies, consumers are given more importance than farmers."

12883,"Friends, the major challenge is to make agriculture economically viable. The solution lies in identifying the gaps in policy formulation and streamlining implementation processes."
12884,"Another important aspect is to encourage farmers to take up allied activities like poultry, dairy, fisheries and aquaculture."
12885,"As I hail from an agriculturist’s family, I am eager to find some practical solutions to the distress faced by farmers."
12886,The Prime Minister met with farmers yesterday and heard their success stories.
12887,The question is how do we draw lessons from the excellent experiments and reform our governance pattern and implement a “transformative” agenda effectively across the country.
12888,The national consultation on farming is taking place.
12889,"I am happy that senior politicians like Shri Sharad Pawar and Shri Devendra Fadnavis and Sobhanadreeswara Rao garu are with us today. Dr M.S Swaminathan, the father of Indian Green revolution, Prof. Gulatiji and a number of eminent Vice Chancellors, agricultural scientists, economists, researchers and policy makers are also with us."
12890,I think it is appropriate that we are meeting in the institute that fosters “cooperative” effort.
12891,Experts and stakeholders need to come together for a brainstorming meeting to discuss and solve problems.
12892,"I am therefore quite hopeful that with your active involvement, we shall be able to come up with a few concrete suggestions at the end of the two day meeting."

13183,"Kabir was a seeker of truth. He was a free spirit, pennyless and austere, but courageous in front of emperors."
13184,Mahatma Kabir Das came to Maghar from Kashi to seek the ultimate truth. Kabir Saheb had said if someone has the Lord Ram in his heart then Maghar is the most sacred place.
13185,"Kya Kasi Kya Usar Maghar, Ram Hriday Baso Mora."
13186,Saint Kabirdas Ji came from Kashi. He was initiated by Ramanand.
13187,"Hum Kashi Mein Prakat Bhaye Hain, Ramanand Chetaye."
13188,Kabir was a disciple of Guru Ramanand. He broke down barriers of caste based discrimination and declared that the entire mankind belonged to him.
13189,"Kabira Khada Bazar Mein, Mange Sabki Khair"
13190,He is a great teacher of people's language. He explained the most complex mysteries of life to the ordinary people in their language.
13191,"Jab Main Tha Tab Hari Nahin, Jab Hari Hai, Main Nahi."
13192,"Sab Andhiara Mit Gaya, Deepak Dekha Mahi."
13193,"When Jesus came, the darkness of ignorance was gone and he saw the light."
13194,"Sages, wise people, godmen and saints have shown the right path to eradicate the internal vices of the society."
13195,"Lord Buddha, Sant Kabir, Sant Soordas and Guru Nanak are living examples of great souls who preserved the country's spirit and protected it from being tarnished by evil traditions."
13196,"In western India we find Maharshi Dayanand, Mira Bai, Saint Eknath, Saint Tukaram, Saint Ramdas, Saint Gyaneshwar, Narsi Mehta and Sri Ramkrishna Paramhans. In the south we find Madhavacharya, Nimbagaracharya and Vallabhacharya. In north we find Ramananda, Kabirdas, Goswami Tulsidas, Soordas, Guru Nanak Dev, Saint Ruidas."
13197,Sant Kabir was the first of a long line of leaders who fought against injustice.
13198,"Today there is an attempt to create a platform for vested political interests in the name of Baba Saheb, Sant Kabir, Mahatma Gandhi and Baba"
13199,People do not take Kabir seriously because they do not believe in his teachings.
13200,Dhai Akhar Prem Ka Padeh So Pandit Hoy.
13201,They are inclined towards grand bungalows. Prime Minister's Awas Yojana was started to provide the houses to the poor and middle class.

13203,Kabir came to Maghar because he wanted to live according to the principles he had learnt from Prophet Muhammad.
13204,"The people who supported the Emergency 43 years ago and those who opposed it today are working together to grab power. They are not concerned about the country or society, they are concerned only about their own interest and the interest of their families. People of the country and the people of Uttar Pradesh must be beware of them."
13205,The political parties are blocking the passage of the triple talaq bill in the Parliament.
13206,Sant Kabirdas Ji had challenged the then emperor.
13207,Dar Ki Bat Kaho Darvesa Badshah Hai Kaun Bhesa.
13208,"Kabir had said that the ideal ruler is he who understands the plight of the people and tries to alleviate it. King Ram was an ideal ruler as his dream state was democratic and neutral to sects. Today, there are several families who consider themselves as the master of destiny of public and they reject the teachings of Sant Kabir Das Ji."
13209,Kabir wanted to empower those who were oppressed.
13210,"Mangan Maran Saman Hai, Mat Koi Mango Bheekh;"
13211,"Mangan Te Marna Bhala, Yeh Satguru Ki Seekh."
13212,Kabir understood the importance of labour but policy makers failed to appreciate this fact.
13213,"The last four years the government has been following the path of empowering the poor, dalit, persecuted, exploited, deprived, women and youth."
13214,Kabir respected labour and he was a doer.
13215,"Kabir believed in doing the work, he believed in Ram. Today, the schemes that are being completed at fast speed, the roads that are constructed twice as fast, new highways, electrification of railway lines, airports, the houses being built at more than twice the speed, optical fibre network, etc. are a reflection of Kabir's path."
13216,The way Kabir shook off the curse of Maghar in his time shows that development must reach every inch of Indian land.
13217,Maghar is the place of final salvation of Sant Kabir. When farmer President Abdul Kalam visited Maghar 14-15 years ago he had a dream for this place. Now we are going to develop Maghar at a fast speed to realise his dreams.
13218,The government is developing places like Maghar as centres of faith and spirituality under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme.
13219,The teachings of Kabir are important and an easy medium for protection of humanity.
13220,Sant Kabir's message should be communicated to everyone and followed. Kabir academy will play an important role in this.

13248,I have full faith in the people who took wise decisions in time and prepared themselves for the every challenge of life. Social security schemes provide us with the strength to deal with the uncertainties and situations of life and overcome them. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or Pradham Mantri Bima yojana reaches millions and millions of people of the country.

13312,President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
13313,Distinguished Delegates from India and abroad
13314,I am in Mumbai for the third annual meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
13315,AIIB started its financing operations in January 2016. It has 87 members and a committed capital stock of 100 billion US dollars.
13316,The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a result of collaborative efforts of Asian countries to provide a better tomorrow to their people.
13317,Asia still suffers from serious economic and social inequalities.
13318,Regional multi-lateralism through institutions such as AIIB can play a central role in helping to raise resources.
13319,"Sectors such as energy and power, transportation, telecom, rural infrastructure, agriculture development, water supply and sanitation, environment protection, urban development, etc. require long term funds."
13320,AIIB approved 25 projects in a dozen countries with a total financing of over 4 billion US dollars.
13321,"With committed capital of 100 billion dollars and huge need for infrastructure in member countries, I take this opportunity to call upon AIIB to expand from financing 4 billion dollars, to 40 billion dollars by 2020 and 100 billion dollars by 2025."
13322,"This would require simpler processing, and faster approval of projects."
13323,"I believe that India and AIIB are both strongly committed to making economic growth more inclusive and sustainable. In India, we are applying novel Public Private Partnership models, Infrastructure Debt Funds and Infrastructure Investment Trusts to fund infrastructure. In addition, India is trying to develop brownfield assets as a separate asset class for infrastructure investment. Institutional investors are likely to be more forthcoming."
13324,AIIB has committed 200 million US dollars for investment in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
13325,India is one of the most investor-friendly economies in the world.
13326,"India's economy grew at 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017. In 2018, it's projected to grow 7.4%. India's economy is the seventh largest in the world and worth 2.8 trillion US dollars."
13327,"""The macro-economic fundamentals of India are strong with stable prices, a robust external sector and a fiscal situation firmly in control. Despite rising oil prices, inflation is within the prescribed range. Government debt as a percentage of GDP is consistently declining. India has achieved a rating upgrade after a long wait."""
13328,The external sector remains robust. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into India have increased steadily.
13329,"From the point of a foreign investor, India counts as an extremely low risk political economy. The Government has taken a number of steps to boost investment."
13330,The government has liberalized the FDI regime.
13331,"The Goods and Services Tax is one of the most significant reforms that our country has undergone. It reduces tax cascading, increases transparency, and adds to logistics efficiency."
13332,India has made significant progress in improving its business environment.
13333,"The size and growth of the Indian market hold much potential for investors. India has over 300 million middle class consumers and is expected to double in the next ten years. For example, the housing programme in India targets ten million houses in urban areas."
13334,Another example of scale would be the Renewable Energy Programme in India. It aims to construct 100 Giga Watt of solar energy capacity by 2022. It has already surpassed its targets. The International Solar Alliance aims to build 1000 Giga Watt of solar capacity with an investment of one trillion US dollars by 2030.
13335,India is working on e-mobility. India will be hosting a global mobility conference this year.
13336,"In India, we are upgrading connectivity at all levels. The Bharatmala scheme is aimed at improving road connectivity by constructing national corridors and highways. The Sagarmala project is for boosting port connectivity, port modernization and port-linked industries. Dedicated Freight Corridors are being developed to mitigate the congestion of railway network. The Jal Marg Vikas project would augment capacity of navigation on National Waterways for internal trade carried through inland water transport. The UDAN scheme works towards regional airport development and improved air connectivity."
13337,The modern day infrastructure of India is based on digital technology. Bharat Net is aimed at providing last mile internet connectivity in the country. 
13338,AIIB should look into potential investment opportunities in agriculture.
13339,"The government aims to provide every poor and homeless household a house with toilet, water and electricity by 2022."
13340,"The government launched Ayushman Bharat, its national health protection mission. It will provide a benefit cover of over 7000 dollars annually to more than 100 million poor and vulnerable families. The resulting expansion of health care facilities will lead to the creation of many jobs."
13341,The Government assures healthcare benefits to poor families. This will increase disposable income and increase demand in the economy.
13342,The Indian story of economic resurgence mirrors that of other parts of Asia.
13343,A ‘New India’ is rising. India looks forward to its continued engagement with development partners including AIIB.
13344,"In conclusion, I hope that the interactions in this forum will be fruitful and enriching for all."
13345,Minister ofForeign Affairs & International Cooperation of the UAE calls on PM

13384,"Friends, the dream that has been realized in Delhi, the kind of results of unshakable resolvesare being witnessed by the people of Delhi-NCR, the same kind of efforts are made throughout the country."
13385,The biggest drawback in the Metro related work was that there was no policy for the Metro and the work related to it.
13386,"The first Metro Policy of the country was prepared in 2017. Now, if the Metro is being developed anywhere in the country, it will be developed on the same set of standards."

15074,"The Ordinance also provides for a mechanism to allow participation of security holders, deposit holders and all other classes of financial creditors that exceed a certain number, in meetings of the Committee of Creditors, through the authorized representation."
15075,"The existing Section 29(A) of the IBC, 2016 has also been fine-tuned to exempt pure play financial entities from being disqualified on account of NPA.Similarly, a resolution application holding an NPA by virtue of acquiringitin the past under the IBC, 2016, has been provided with a three-year cooling-off period, from the date of such acquisition.In other words, such NPA shall not disqualify the resolution application during the currency of the three-year grace period."
15076,"Taking into account the wide range of disqualifications contained in Section 29(A) of the Code, the Ordinance provides that the Resolution Applicant shall submit an affidavit certifying its eligibility to bid.This places the primary onus on the resolution applicant to certify its eligibility."
15077,The Ordinance provides for a minimum one-year grace period for the successful resolution applicant to fulfill various statutory obligations required under different laws.This would go a long way in enabling the new management to successfully implement the resolution plan.

16336,"Please find below the Text of the Article written by the Union Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley on “The IBC (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 and the Homebuyer”:"
16337,"“Post 1991 economic liberalisation, there has been a phenomenal growth in the creation of new townships, urbanisation and sub-urbanisation.”"
16338,"The new ordinance equates an “allottee” of a “real estate project” to be a person having a commercial effect of borrowing.He is now treated as financial creditor.He can initiate a corporate insolvency for a resolution against the errant developer.He acquires the right to be on the committee of creditors.He gets voting right.He can influence the resolution process.In the unlikely eventuality of liquidation, he stands at par with other financial creditors."
16339,"Given his logistical problems, liquidations are rarely likely to take place in asset owning companies.Resolution is the natural course.In a resolution probably some other developer would acquire an interest or some alternative method found of completing the project.The inevitable consequence of this would be that the market itself will discover solutions.Just as the film industry, in the last few years, has increasingly formalised itself, the real estate industry would eventually will have to formalise itself.Sound and structured real estate developers would remain.The “fly by night” operators would be eliminated.Projects would be completed in reasonable time and investors would get their share of allotments expeditiously.Construction is already growing at a double digit growth.RERA and the new ordinance would only catalyse this process further”."

17347,Topic - SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY FUTURE
17348,"Fellow panelists, Excellencies and distinguished guests,"
17349,It is a pleasure to meet you all at the OPEC forum. I have earlier attended this forum in 2015. This year’s forum is more critical to present a major buying country’ s point of view than ever before.
17350,"The energy vision of Prime Minister Modi has 4 pillars - Energy Access, Energy Efficiency, Energy Sustainability and Energy Security. India has demonstrated strong commitment to the Paris Agreement and has taken the lead in promoting the International Solar Alliance. In the oil and gas sector, India has migrated to Euro IV norms and is preparing to migrate to Euro 6 by April 2020. Promoting biofuels, energy efficiency and moving to a gas based economy are also priorities."
17351,The forum on sustainable pricing of oil and gas is being held.
17352,OPEC and its members should step in to fill the gap in the gap caused by reduced output of some countries to ensure sustainable prices.
17353,"Globally crude prices have gone beyond the threshold which can be sustained by the world, particularly countries like India. Global economic growth will be at risk if oil prices continue to rise. "
17354,"While we are in favour of prices as low as $30 per barrel, we do not support the prevailing high price."
17355,"If the world has to grow as a whole, there has to be a mutually supportive relationship between producers and consumers. OPEC as the predominant supplier has the responsibility to maintain supply equilibrium."
17356,"I will end by quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Father of our Great Nation who said that earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need but not every man’s greed."
17357,Dharmendra Pradhan on a visit to Austria and Germany
17358,"The Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship Dharmendra Pradhan will lead an official delegation to participate in the 7th OPEC International Seminar organised by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as a special guest in Vienna, Austria from 19-20th June 2018."

17364,Frequently Asked Questions on BEE recommendations on temperature setting of Air Conditioners
17365,The BEE recommends optimum temperature setting of air conditioners.
17366,"Answer:Bureau of Energy Efficiency (Ministry of Power) has issued the guidelines to major commercial establishments with the objective of conserving energy through optimum temperature settings for the Air Conditioners, within the comfort zone /chart.It is estimated that changing the temperature from conventional 20-21 degree Celsius can result in approximately at 24 per cent of energy savings."
17367,2. What is the estimated saving potential due to this initiative?
17368,Consumers could save energy by adopting energy conservation measures.
17369,The default setting at 24 degrees Celsius is meant to be the maximum temperature for ACs.
17370,The default setting of a machine is 24 degrees Celsius. The user can adjust or set the air conditioner at a lower or higher temperature as per her choice.
17371,4. Why is it beneficial to reset AC equipment to 24 degrees Celsius?
17372,"The normal human body temperature is between 36-37 degrees Celsius. In large commercial establishments, like hotels, Airports and offices, the AC operating staff try to set the temperature around 18-21 degrees Celsius to improve cooling performance of AC system. However, it is not true and the cooling action of AC is the same at other settings. People wear warm clothing because the ambient temperature is too cool. As per the comfort chart, temperatures up to 25 degrees C are comfortable for human body."
17373,"5. If there are more people in the room, will it be possible to maintain comfort conditions?"
17374,The same temperature setting will allow AC equipment to provide cooling even if there are more people.
17375,The default temperature of AC should be 24 degrees Celsius.
17376,"According to the report, increasing the temperature of a room by 1 degree Celsius will save about 6 per cent of electricity. The ideal temperature for a room is 24-25 degrees Celsius. If room temperature is increased by 4 degrees Celsius, it will save 24 per cent electricity."
17377,"Therefore, the users will be able to save significant amount of energy (and money) by running their air-conditioners at 24-degree Celsius."
17378,BEE is targeting buildings/areas that could implement the guidelines.
17379,"Answer: The Guidelines have been recommended to the major commercial establishments such as Airports, Hotels, Shopping Malls, Offices and Government Buildings (Ministries & attached offices, State Government and Public-Sector Undertakings)."
17380,8.
17381,"According to ASHAE Standard 55-2013 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, the thermal comfort zone is the condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment. It can be between 24-25 degrees Celsius at desired levels of humidity and air movement."
17382,The advisory is not mandatory right now.
17383,The advisory for commercial establishments has been issued for voluntary adoption. A public survey will be conducted after 4-6 months to promote adoption of the guidelines.
17384,10. Is setting the thermostat at 18 degrees Celsius faster than keeping it at 24 degrees Celsius?
17385,The thermostat stops the compressor when the temperature inside the room reaches the desired level.
17386,11. Why is this move important for India?
17387,"Bureau of Energy Efficiency estimates that the total connected load due to air conditioning in India will reach 200 GW by 2030. If the measures are followed by all consumers, India can save about 23 billion units of electricity."
17388,12. Is India the first country to take such a measure?
17389,Air conditioners should be operated at 28 degrees Celsius.
17390,Power Minister Shri RK Singh launches campaign to promote energy efficiency in the area of air-conditioning.
17391,The default temperature setting on ACs should be 24 degrees Celsius.
17392,Air-conditioners save energy by increasing the temperature setting.
17393,The default setting in the air-conditioning should be at 24 degrees Celsius.
17394,Air conditioner manufacturers have been advised to keep default setting of air conditioners at 24 degrees Celsius and to carry out labelling indicating the optimum temperature setting.
17395,"After an awareness campaign of 4-6 months, followed by a survey to gather public feedback, the Ministry of Power would consider making this mandatory. If all the consumers adopt, it will result in savings of 20 billion units of electricity in one year."
17396,All the manufacturers and associations of air-conditioner manufacturers present in the meeting have agreed on this and appreciated it as a step in the right direction.
17397,"The total connected load due to air conditioning in India will be 200 GW by 2030 and this may increase further. Today, only 6% of households use air conditioners. The total installed capacity of air conditioner in India is 80 million TR (ton of refrigerators). According to the estimates, this capacity will increase to 250 million TR by 2030. This will save about 40 million units of electricity per day."
17398,The initiative aims to promote the adoption of the guidelines in commercial buildings.

18317,"As per a recent poll, India is the most dangerous country for women."
18318,Reuters has used a flawed methodology to arrive at its ranking of the world's most influential women.
18319,"The six questions posed as part of the poll cannot fairly be applied to all countries. For example, child marriage is different in every country, mutilation as a means of punishment, female genital mutilation, stoning etc. are not practiced in India."
18320,There is an open system of government and media in India to discuss sensitive issues of violence against women.
18321,"According to a poll, India is far ahead of other countries in most of the indicators."
18322,"For example, as per Sample Registration Survey (SRS) released in June 2018, India has registered a significant reduction in Maternal Mortality Ratio since 2013 and a rise in sex ratio at birth."

18326,The level of human trafficking is falling.
18327,"Despite data to the contrary, the usage of an opinion poll to peg India as the most dangerous country for women is clearly an effort to malign the nation and draw attention away from real improvements seen in recent years."
18328,"Ever since the unfortunate incident of 2012, the entire country has been alert about the safety of women and ensuring their equality at home, in the economy and in society at large."
18329,"The recently enacted Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012, the Criminal Law Amendment Act 2013 and the Criminal law (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 have provided more stringent punishment for rape. They have also introduced new offences. "

18615,"Methanol is a clean burning drop in fuel which can replace both petrol and diesel in transportation, LPG, Wood, Kerosene and cooking fuel. It can also replace diesel in Railways, Marine Sector, Gensets, Power Generation and could be an ideal complement to Hybrid and Electric Mobility. Methanol can be produced from a variety of feedstocks like Natural Gas, Coal, Bio-mass, Municipal Solid waste and CO2."
18616,Methanol is an excellent transport fuel. It reduces pollution by up to 80%.
18617,Methanol has the potential to be an enduring solution to human energy needs. C02 (greenhouse gas emission) from using Methanol and producing Methanol can be sequestered and can be tapped back to produce more Methanol.
18618,NITI Aayog has drawn out a comprehensive plan to replace 20% of crude imports from Methanol. Indian Railways alone burns three billion litres of diesel every year. The other sector where Methanol is becoming the fuel of choice is the marine sector.
18619,"Methanol can reduce pollution in many areas. For example, it can be used to produce electricity."
18620,"Methanol fuel can be an indigenous fuel for India. It can be at least 30% cheaper than any other fuel. At least 20% diesel consumption can be reduced in next 5-7 years and will result in a savings of up to Rs. 26,000 crore annually. The Methanol blending program with petrol will further reduce fuel bill by at least Rs. 5000 crore annually in next 3 years."
18621,"Methanol Economy, if adopted by India can be one of the best ways to mitigate the Environmental hazards of a growing economy. NITI Aayog is preparing a road map for a full-scale implementation."

19152,The recent investigations by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into funding of separatist groups and their leaders have disrupted the supply of funds to the separatist groups.
19153,Following is the text of Vice President’s address:
19154,The National Investigation Agency (NIA) organises a lecture in honour of late R.V. Raju.
19155,"The national security environment in India is determined by its geographical attributes, socio-economic milieu and by regional and global developments."
19156,"India is a vast, multi-dimensional country with a rich cultural heritage and vast geographical area. It shares its land boundaries with six countries and its maritime boundaries with seven."
19157,The national security challenges can be broadly categorised as internal challenges and external challenges.
19158,"The internal challenges facing Pakistan are growing radicalization in society, separatist movements, insurgencies, communalism and Maoist violence."
19159,There are some misguided elements who use violence as an instrument to achieve political goals.
19160,The growing radicalization in our society has roots in distorted view of religion and ethnic identity.
19161,There is an unending spiral of violence in different parts of our country. The government has worked hard to contain the situation in Kashmir and the insurgency in the north-eastern region. The peace treaty with the Naga rebels was one of the initiatives.
19162,"Friends, India is now the fastest growing major economy in the world. India needs to grow faster to provide basic means of livelihood and decent opportunities to all its citizens. The need of the hour is to ensure that India remains peaceful. "
19163,In this century wars are fought on all fronts including the economic front. Economic warfare is one of the most potent tools to undermine the peace and security of a nation.
19164,"With regard to the external threats, the biggest challenge for India's national security is the cross-border terrorism. One of India's neighbours supports acts of terrorism and tries to damage the monetary stability and economic security of India."
19165,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has proved the role of neighbouring country in the Pathankot, Uri and Handwara terrorist attack and counterfeit currency notes cases."
19166,The dynamics of international terrorism have changed with certain groups using cyber communication to spread their ideology. Foreign Terrorist Fighters or the FTF and Lone Wolf attacks are taking place in many parts of the world.
19167,"The recent terrorist attacks in Europe and in Bangladesh have made us realise that national boundaries are no barrier for terrorists to propagate, recruit, plan and carry out attacks anywhere and at any place. The NIA has registered and investigated many cases involving cyber terrorism and arrested many people."
19168,The cyber revolution has brought immense benefits but at the same time has created certain vulnerabilities and risks.
19169,The proliferation of internet-based social media platforms and communication tools by terrorist outfits for planning and execution of terrorist incidents has further exacerbated the situation.
19170,The only effective way to tackle global active terrorist individuals and outfits is through international cooperation.
19171,Some member states continue to flout UN resolutions against terrorism despite being members of the UN.
19172,No terrorist organization can function without finances. Painstaking investigation in the past has provided useful breakthroughs and disrupted terrorist cells.
19173,The recent investigations by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in tracing and tracking the funding of separatist groups and leaders have disrupted the supply of funds to the separatist groups.
19174,"Today, global terrorism is the biggest threat to democracy."
19175,The security forces and security agencies all over the world must work together to defeat international terrorism.
19176,"For decades, India has fought the scourge of terrorism with fortitude and firm resolve. The success of the security forces in bringing peace to the states of North-East, Punjab and Kashmir speaks volumes of the deft handling of the situation by security forces and agencies. India will continue to fight all forces inimical to the security and integrity of India."
19177,The domestic legal framework against terrorism in India has been strengthened from time to time.
19178,The government is in the process of making further amendments to the ant-terror laws to empower law enforcement agencies to not only ensure effective investigation in terrorism cases but also have fruitful prosecution to meet the ends of justice.

19853,Mr. Klaus Schwab is the founder and executive chairman of World Economic Forum.
19854,"Senior and reputable entrepreneurs, industrialists and CEOs of the world,"
19855,"Friends from Media, ladies and gentlemen!"
19856,I am attending the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
19857,The last Prime Minister of India to visit Davos was Deve Gowda ji in 1997. India's GDP has increased by 6 times since then. 
19858,"Tweeting in the previous century was the task of birds, not humans."
19859,"In the past, Davos was a symbol of a futuristic entity. Today it is a complex network."
19860,"This year's theme is ""Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World""."
19861,"Technology driven transformation is deeply impacting our lifestyle, work-style, dealing with issues, conversation and even international groupings."
19862,In the current environment there are serious challenges for the future of humanity.
19863,Is our world system promoting these fault-lines and distances? Which are those forces that promote separation over unity and promote struggle or conflicts over cooperation? And what are the tools we have? What are the paths through which we can erase these cracks and distances and fulfill the dream of a happy and a shared future?

19870,"In March this year, French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders from the member countries of the International Solar Alliance will attend the first summit of the Alliance in New Delhi."
19871,The second major challenge facing India is terrorism. The educated and accomplished youth are radicalized and getting involved in terrorism.
19872,"The second challenge is that many societies and countries are becoming more and more self-centered. The third is that globalization is fading. Although everyone talks about the interconnected world, the glow of globalization is dimming. World Trade Organization and United Nations were formed after the Second World War."

20331,"When I was the Chief Minister, I used to be conscious of which departments had not used their budget. Nowadays, people have the habit of performing."

20340,"If we talk about school dropouts, sometimes tour programmes are organized for the kids. They are sometimes taken to temples or to the banks of a river or to a garden. Can these children be taken to a nearby primary school? They can have the midday meal with the school students. Anganwadi will develop the interest of going to school."
20341,The Prime Minister asked the university to allow 50 poor students from government school to be seated in the front rows during the convocation ceremony.
20342,Every school organises an assembly in the morning. Every day one student can talk on some topic for 10 minutes regarding our target of 2022.
20343,"If we can achieve One Target properly and move on to the second one successfully, then it will set an example for the people of other districts. If we go by this tradition, the targets set for the 115 districts will also be achieved."
20344,"Another issue is that of infrastructure. People should be required to plant trees on both sides of the roads as a condition for the construction of the road. Eventually, the road can be constructed through MGNREGA. The aspirations of the people should merge with the schemes of the government with public participation."
20345,"Even if 115 districts in India move ahead by ten steps, it will not be enough to transform the country."
20346,"It is human nature to wish for a window seat in a train or an aeroplane. When an officer gets posted, he or she will be placed in a backward district."

21251,The country’s economy has grown by 0.5% in the year 2017-18.
21252,The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare (MoAFW) is planning to increase the growth rate for the Agriculture sector in 2017-18.
21253,"The components of the economic activity ‘Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing’ and their respective approximate GVA shares are as below:"
21254,Fishing and aquaculture – 5.5 per cent
21255,"Further, crop sector includes both agriculture and horticulture, of which foodgrains are pre-dominant."
21256,"The Advance Estimate released by CSO is based on the data on crop coverage and estimated production shared by the Directorate of Economics & Statistics (DES), Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare and the Central Statistics Office (CSO)."
21257,"In respect of horticultural crops, another important component of the crop sector the data relating to area coverage and production Estimate was shared by the Horticulture Advisor, Ministry of Agriculture with the CSO."
21258,"The area coverage under different crops in Kharif as of August, 2017 was below that of the previous year due to delay in onset of monsoon and poorer rainfall. However, good rainfall after that helped the Ministry to increase the area coverage in accordance with the kharif targets."
21259,There has been a positive trend in respect of both area coverage and production of fruits and vegetables as of December 2017.
21260,"The area covered under crops in August 2017 had a negative impact on the Advance Estimate for the overall Agriculture sector. However, the GVA estimate will get revised upwards if increased area coverage by December 2017 and concomitant production estimate is taken into consideration."
21261,"The delayed onset of monsoons has affected the area covered by the Ministry of Agriculture by August, 2017. However, by December, the field situation was positive. The growth rate of the GVA of Agriculture was 2.1%, driven by higher growth rates in livestock and fishery sectors."
21262,"The Ministry of Agriculture is optimistic about achieving a high growth rate because the Rabi, 2017 is showing a good performance. The area covered under Rabi is 58.6 million ha, which is a good progress. Rabi sowing continues until the first week of February."
21263,The Ministry of Agriculture expects to consolidate the record production achieved during the year 2016-17 and increase the credit made available to farmers.
21264,The Advance Estimate for the year 2017-18 comes on the back of a very robust GVA of 4.9 per cent in the previous year. The Ministry has been focusing on achieving higher productivity in all the segments including crops.
21265,"The Agriculture sector can, therefore, be expected to register a much higher GVA for the year 2017-18, when final estimate figures are released."
21266,"Farmers can increase income by adopting technologies like crop rotation, integrated farming, organic farming, double/triple cropping system"
