6026,Following is the full text of the speech – 
6027,“I am happy to be with all of you today to release the book Future of Education - Nine Megatrends”
6028,"In the current situation, I had to release a volume virtually and address you from the Upa- Rashtrapathi Niwas."
6029,"Today, we are in the midst of a major health emergency."
6030,"In these difficult times, a number of aspects of our life are changing. Education is one of them."
6031,Education is increasingly being conducted online.
6032,"ICT Academy, a joint initiative of the Government of India and the state governments has been using the power of technology to impart skills."
6033,It is bringing industry and academia closer.
6034,The ICT Academy is continuing to serve the academic community through initiatives such as “Sky Campus”.
6035,The book I just released highlights some important trends and points to the future in education.
6036,"In ancient India, students were sent to live at the Guruji's home and the Guru would suggest a customized curriculum based on their abilities. He used to design tests to make sure that they mastered what they were taught."
6037,This was individualized learning at its best.
6038,Takshashila University was established around 1000 BC.
6039,Nalanda was an ancient institution similar to today's universities.
6040,The education of the 21st century is very different from the Gurukula days and how education was delivered in Takshashila and Nalanda.
6041,The education sector has been transforming rapidly in the last few decades. There has been a digital explosion and knowledge revolution. More children are in schools and universities than earlier.
6042,"In the midst of this transformation, we now have the challenging context of the pandemic."
6043,This is forcing each one of us to seek new ways of doing what we have been doing for a number of years.
6044,"To survive in the new world, educational institutions are going digital."
6045,"Teachers and students are using cloud-based platforms to communicate, work and conduct exams."
6046,New technologies are being used in classrooms.
6047,This will transform the way people learn.
6048,Teacher training will have to be reorientated in light of changes in the nature of teaching.
6049,The teacher will have to learn new skills of delivering learning online.
6050,The students would have to learn new skills.
6051,Technology offers immense opportunities.
6052,There are many learning resources available online.
6053,"Would it not be wonderful if sitting in a remote village in India, an aspiring scholar can access a book in the library at Harvard?"
6054,"With online laboratories, students can access machines anytime from anywhere and can practice before getting into a real lab."
6055,The role of the teacher has changed over the years.
6056,"As the book mentions, the role of the teacher will change from that of a “sage” on the “stage” to a ‘guide’ by the side of the student."
6057,Teachers must therefore adapt their approach to teaching in tune with the rapidly changing scenario.
6058,Technology opens up new possibilities but also presents challenges.
6059,There are many children who do not have access to digital devices.
6060,"If we have to realize the dream of universal quality primary education, if we have to have an equitable secondary and higher education, we will have to address the issue of this wide gap in access to technology."
6061,Technology must be accessible and affordable.
6062,The campus is on lockdown. This makes it difficult for students to study online.
6063,Many parents in India still cannot afford digital devices.
6064,Bridging the digital divide is too big and complex a task for the government to accomplish on its own.
6065,Private sector companies should adapt and contextualize their products to meet the needs of learners and price them accordingly to make them affordable.
6066,This is your time to make a momentous contribution to nation building and to securing a bright future for all our children.
6067,Bharat Net is connecting all the villages with high-speed broadband network.
6068,The state governments must come up with innovative ways to improve education.
6069,This is a moment of disruption.
6070,Let us understand the changes and adapt creatively to the new normal.
6071,Let us prepare for and shape the future by turning adversity into an opportunity.
6072,We have a huge demographic advantage waiting to be converted into a demographic dividend.
6073,We should enhance access to knowledge and skills to all children so that each one of them realizes his or her innate potential.
6074,Education is an important part of development.
6075,Education should be value-based and make students acquire knowledge and wisdom.
6076,The curriculum should focus on culture and heritage and highlight the importance of protecting nature.
6077,Protect nature and preserve culture for a better future.
6078,Teachers should have societal concerns.
6079,The education system in India must reflect Indian culture and ethos.
6080,"I extend a special appreciation to Shri M Sivakumar, CEO, ICT Academy and Shri V Pattabhi Ram, author of the book, ""Future of Education - Nine Mega Trends"", for bringing out the book."
6081,This book is a good starting point for further work on transforming the learning process of tomorrow.

When the crisis of Corona pandemic started growing, both the Central Government and the State Governments were concerned about you all. They sent help to the locations where people were in. Special trains were started for migrant brothers and sisters."
6427,Coronavirus pandemic shook the world but you stood firm. The way Corona was fought in the villages of India has taught an important lesson to the cities.
6428,"Just imagine! Our country has more than 6 lakh villages, in which more than two-thirds of the population live, which amounts to 80-85 crore people. The population of these villages is more than the entire population of Europe, America, Russia and Australia. Therefore, you have effectively prevented Coronavirus from spreading in rural India."
6429,"The village heads, Anganwadi workers, ASHA workers and Jeevika Didi have done a commendable job."
6430,Some people in India do not appreciate the valour of the people of rural India for saving the lives of villagers from the virus.
6431,"Well, whether someone pats you on the back or not, I will keep on cheering you. You saved thousands and thousands of people from Corona."
6432,"Today, before launching this programme, I salute all the villages and the villagers in India for their work!"

6435,Today is a historic day. A huge campaign has started for the welfare of the poor and for their employment. Most of the workers who have returned home after the lockdown are the migrant labourers.
6436,"My friends, the country understands your feelings as well as your needs."
6437,"Today, the 'Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojana' being launched from Khagaria is a great tool to fulfil this requirement."
6438,The campaign to give work to the rural workers and the labourers will be carried out in 116 districts of 6 states.

6442,"Just imagine! How much talent has returned to the villages! When the labour and skills that had helped to speed up development and progress in every city of the country will be used in the rural areas like Khagaria, then what level of development will Bihar achieve!"
6443,"Under the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan, 50 thousand crore rupees will be used for the development of your villages and to give you employment. 25 development works related to basic amenities will be implemented in villages.

6455,"If Jan Dhan accounts had not been created, if these accounts were not linked with Aadhaar cards and mobile numbers, then how could this have happen? You might remember the older times!"
6456,Money used to be released in your names but would never reach you!

6458,Self-reliant farmers are important for self-reliance of India.

6460,The law has been changed so that farmers can sell their crops outside their state.
6461,The Atmanirbhar Bharat package announced by the government aims to connect farmers directly to the market and provide cold storage for their produce.
6462,The government has announced another decision under the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan'. Industrial clusters will be formed so that different products and packaging items can be made with local produce in the small towns and cities near villages.
6463,"Now,in Khagaria, maize is produced in plenty! If the farmer is directly connected with the companies that make maize products and if local products are made out of Khagaria maize, then it will increase the profits a lot! Similarly, Bihar has Makhana, Lychees and Bananas! There are Amlas and mangoes from UP; there are chillies from Rajasthan; pulses from Madhya Pradesh; and Odisha and Jharkhand have good forest produce.There are many such local products in every district and the plan is to set up industries associated with them nearby."
6464,All these efforts for the last 6 years have the same objective - to develop villages and the poor.
6465,This self-esteem will be protected by the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan.
6466,I request all villagers to take necessary precautions when they leave for work.
6467,"May all of you be healthy and continue to move forward; and let the country move ahead with you! With these best wishes, thank you very much!!"

8906,"The IMD has released a report on Super Cyclonic Storm ""Amphan"" that crossed West Bengal coast during May, 2020."
8907,"• The Super Cyclonic Storm (SuCS) “AMPHAN” (pronounced as UM-PUN) was the first SuCS over the BoB, after the Odisha SuCS of 1999."
8908,• It originated from the remnant of a Low Pressure Area which occurred in the near Equatorial Easterly wave over south Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal (BoB) on 13th May.
8909,• It concentrated into a depression (D) over southeast BoB in the early morning of 16th May and further intensified into a deep depression (DD) in the same afternoon.
8910,"The cyclonic storm intensified into a Severe Cyclonic Storm over southeast BoB in the evening of 16th May, 2020."
8911,"• It underwent rapid intensification during subsequent 24 hours and accordingly intensified into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS) by the afternoon of 17th, Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm (ESCS) in the early hours of 18th and into a SuCS around noon of 18th May, 2020."
8912,"• It maintained the intensity of SuCS over westcentralBoB for nearly 24 hours, before weakening into an ESCS over westcentralBoB around noon of 19th May."
8913,The storm brought maximum sustained wind speed of 155- 165 kmph gusting to 185 kmph over West Bengal. It moved close to Kolkata during this period.
8914,The system weakened further north-northeastwards. It weakened into a CS over Bangladesh and adjoining West Bengal around mid-night of 20th May. It further weakened into D over north Bangladesh and lay as a well marked low pressure area around midnight of 21st May.
8915,The system that formed in the north Indian Ocean was monitored since 23rd April. It was forecasted to form on 13th May.
8916,The cyclone was monitored by the IMD Doppler Weather Radars from 18th May midnight (1800 UTC) till 20th May.
8917,• The system was monitored since 23rd April about three weeks prior to the formation of Low Pressure Area over the southeast BoB on 13th May.
8918,The cyclogenesis of depression is predicted with low probability in the later part of week during 8th-14th May 2020. It is also predicted that the system will intensify further and move initially north-northwestwards and recurve north-northeastwards towards north BoB.
8919,"• In the Tropical Weather Outlook issued on 9th May, it was indicated that a Low Pressure Area would form over the region on 13th May (96 hours prior to formation of the system) under the influence of the remnant cyclonic circulation persisting over the region during 6th-12th."
8920,The low pressure area formed on 13 May and concentrated into a depression on 16 May morning.
8921,"Track, Intensity and Landfall Forecast"
8922,"• First information was provided in the extended range outlook issued on 7th May (about 6 days prior to formation of LPA, 9 days prior to formation of depression and 13 days prior to Landfall) indicated that the system would intensify into a cyclonic storm and move initially northwestwards and recurve north-northeastwards towards north BoB,"
8923,"• In the Tropical Weather Outlook, Press release and informatory message to the Government of India issued on 13th April (on the day of development of LPA, 3 days prior to formation of depression and 7 days prior to Landfall), it was indicated that the system would intensify into a cyclonic storm by 16th evening and would move initially northwestwards till 17th and then recurve north-northeastwards towards north BoB."
8924,"• Actually, the depression formed in the morning (0000 UTC) of 16th, cyclonic storm in the evening (1200 UTC) of 16th and the system moved north-northwestwards till 17th evening (1200 UTC) followed by north-northeastward recurvature thereafter and crossed West Bengal coast on 20th Afternoon."
8925,"• In the first bulletin issued at 0845 IST of 16th May (104 hrs prior to landfall) with the formation of Depression, it was indicated that the system would intensify into a cyclonic storm and will move north-northwestwards till 17th May followed by north-northeastward re-curvature towards West Bengal coast during 18th-20th May and cross West Bengal coast with maximum sustained wind speed of 155-165 kmph gusting to 180 kmph."
8926,"• In the bulletin issued at 1645 hrs IST of 16th May (24 hrs prior to rapid intensification), rapid intensification of the system was predicted and the system rapidly intensified from 17th afternoon onwards."

9748,The collecting agents for the transactions are the Stock Exchanges and the Depositories.

11913,"Shri R. K Singh, the Minister of State for Power and MNRE, held a Press Meet through Video Conferencing today. He underlined the importance of proposed reforms in the power sector. "
11914,The powers of fixing electricity tariff remain with SERCs. States can give as much subsidy as they want but they must pay it upfront through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).
11915,The draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 proposes to amend the Electricity Act 2003.
11916,• Enhance sustainability of the power sector
11917,There are some proposed amendments to the Electricity Act.
11918,Misconception 1: Transfer the power of appointment to SERCs from State to Central Government
11919,There is no proposal to take away the power of appointment of Members/Chairpersons of State Electricity Regulatory Commissions from the State Governments. The Selection Committee has equal number of members from the Central and State Governments and is chaired by a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court.
11920,Misconception 2: DBT is against the interests of consumers
11921,Another misconception is that the proposed provisions for introducing the system of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of subsidies is inimical to the interest of the consumers especially the farmers.
11922,Misconception 3: Power to set retail power tariff is being transferred from State to Central Government
11923,Another misconception is that the Central Government proposes to take over the fixing of electricity tariff for retail supply to consumers. The current tariff is determined by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission and no change has been proposed.
11924,The other major amendments proposed in the Electricity Act are as follows.
11925,"(i) Cost reflective Tariff: To eliminate the tendency of Commissions to provide for regulatory assets, it is being provided that the Commissions shall determine tariffs that are reflective of cost so as to enable Discoms to recover their costs. The total regulatory asset, ie revenue due to a Discom but not collected because appropriate tariff increase was not given, is about Rs. 1.4 Lakh Cys."
11926,"(ii) Establishment of adequate Payment Security Mechanism for scheduling of electricity - It is proposed to empower Load Dispatch Centres to oversee the establishment of adequate payment security mechanism before dispatch of electricity, as per contracts."
11927,"The late payment of dues to Gencos and Transcos is putting a strain on the liquidity of the power sector. Therefore, it is being provided that electricity supplies will not be scheduled or despatched until security of payment is established."
11928,"(ii) Cross Subsidy: At present, the Act provides for the State Commissions to progressively reduce cross subsidies. Cross subsidies are in excess of 50% in some States making industries uncompetitive. The new Bill provides for SERCs to reduce the cross subsidies in accordance with the Tariff Policy."
11929,"(iv) Establishment of Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority: CERC and SERCs do not have powers to execut the orders of a civil court. An Authority headed by a retired Judge of the High Court is proposed to be set up with such powers as attachment and sale of property, arrest and detention in prison, and appointment of a receiver to enforce performance of electricity contracts."
11930,"(v) National Renewable Energy Policy: For environmental reasons, it is in India's long-term interest to promote green power. India is a signatory to the Paris Climate Agreement. It is proposed to have a separate policy for the development and promotion of electricity from renewable sources of energy."
11931,(vi) It is also proposed that a minimum percentage of purchase of electricity from hydro sources of energy is to be specified by the Commissions.
11932,(vii) Penalties: It is being further proposed to levy penalties for non-fulfilment of obligation to buy electricity from renewable and/or hydro sources of energy.
11933,(vii) Strengthening of the Appellate Tribunal (APTEL): It is proposed to increase the strength of APTEL to at least seven members and give it the powers of High Court under the Contempt of Courts Act.
11934,"(ix) Penalties: In order to ensure compliance of the provisions of the Electricity Act and orders of the Commission, section 142 and section 146 of the Electricity Act are proposed to be amended to provide for higher penalties."
11935,(x) Cross border trade in Electricity: Provisions have been added to facilitate and develop trade in electricity with other countries.
11936,"(xi) Distribution sub-licensees: To improve quality of supply, an option is proposed to be provided to Discoms to authorise another person as a sub-license to supply electricity in any particular part of its area, with the permission of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission."
11937,There are no new provisions in the Act relating to Distribution Franchisee.

12454,Role of ancient algae in building a healthy global marine ecosystem
12455,"By-Mohammad Faiyaz Anwar, Scientist at Vigyan Prasar Science Portal"
12456,There is a decrease in the concentration of oceanic calcium carbonate in the Southern Indian Ocean. This decrease is due to an increase in diatoms.
12457,Coccolithophores are microscopic algae living in the upper layers of the oceans. Coccoliths produce up to 40% of open ocean calcium carbonate and are responsible for 20% of net marine primary productivity.
12458,Coccolithophores help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and ocean by consuming it during photosynthesis.
12459,"NCPOR, the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), and the Goa University revealed that abundance and diversity enrichment of coccolithophores in the southern Indian Ocean is highly dependent on time and influenced by various environmental factors such as silicate concentrations, calcium carbonate concentration, diatom abundance, light intensity and availability of macro and possibly micronutrient concentrations."
12460,The research team's analysis revealed that coccolithophore diversity in the early summer and late summer is reduced due to an increase in the presence of diatom algae. Silicate concentration in the waters of the Southern Ocean increases with climate change and ocean acidification. The scientists also discovered that the maximum coccoidophore richness is in the Subtropical Zone and Sub-Antarctic Zone.
12461,Scientists have discovered that the biogeographic boundaries of coccolithophores in the southern Indian Ocean are highly variable and controlled by environmental factors.
12462,The results of the study point to climate change as a major reason for the altered coccolithophore calcification rate. The future of coccoid is uncertain.
12463,"The research team from NCPOR, Goa and NIO has published a research paper in the Journal of Deep-Sea Research Part II."

12530,Scientists detect ionospheric irregularities during major space weather events that influence communication & navigation systems
12531,The Earth's magnetic field lines are nearly horizontal over the equatorial ionosphere. This poses a serious problem for communication and navigation systems.
12532,Scientists from the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism have found that the occurrence of equatorial spread F (ESF) irregularities and GPS scintillations is significantly affected by the time of the geomagnetic storm.
12533,They have found that geomagnetic storms produce a partial enhancement in pre reversal enhancement (PRE) in the zonal eastward electric field. Pre reversal enhancement can be produced by F region dynamo.
12534,Understanding the thermosphere‐ionosphere-magnetosphere interactions that control the electrodynamics behind dynamical evolution of ionospheric irregularities under disturbed periods like geomagnetic storms is most important in developing and maintaining communication and navigation systems.
12535,"Accordingly, the electrodynamics under these major space weather events was studied using the chain of a ground-based special type of radar Doppler ionosondes along with GPS Receivers over India for the examination of the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere."
12536,"In the present study conducted by Dr. Ram Singh under the guidance of Dr. Sripathi from IIG, the coupling of high latitude electric fields, winds, and traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) on the ionosphere was investigated during three major space weather events that occurred on 17th March, 23 June, and 20 December 2015."
12537,The ionosphere reached a virtual height of 560 km over magnetic equator.
12538,Nocturnal thermospheric meridional winds during the storm night suggested the equatorward surge of gravity waves in a period of 2 hours. The suppression of anomaly crest over Indian longitude on the next day is linked to the westward disturbance dynamo electric fields and disturbance wind effects.
12539,The geomagnetic storms can produce positive or negative stormsthat modify the electrodynamics of the ionosphere.

13023,Aerosol characterization and radiative effects at High Altitude site in Western-Trans Himalayas
13024,The study can help better understanding the aerosol optical and microphysical properties and improving the modelling of aerosol effects in view of aerosol-climate implications
13025,Aerosol radiative forcing from the atmosphere over the trans-Himalayas is larger than the global average. The warming from this forcing can be measured in Celsius degrees per day.
13026,"The atmospheric aerosols play a key role in the regional and global climate system through scattering and absorption of incoming solar radiation and by modifying the cloud microphysics. Despite the large progress in quantifying the impact of different aerosols on radiative forcing, there are still some uncertainties in the climate change assessment. Precise measurements are needed to reduce the uncertainties."
13027,"The study led by Dr. Umesh Chandra Dumka and co-authored by Shantikumar S. Ningombam and Dimitris G. Kaskaoutis, studies the aerosol optical, physical and radiative properties from January 2008 to December 2018 and the role of fine and coarse particles in aerosol radiative forcing (ARF)."

15310,These advantages clearly make online education a preferred choice and it appears that the adoption of online learning will continue to persist post-pandemic period as well.
15311,The course of evolution of human civilization has been a saga of innovation in the making and use of tools for improving the ease and the comfort of living.
15312,The way we live has changed dramatically thanks to science and technology.
15313,This is an ongoing quest that never ends. Interconnectedness through ‘internet’ is the order of the present day life. Artificial intelligence is set to further change the scheme of things.
15314,Digitalisation is the order of present-day life.
15315,An educational technology and online tutoring firm from South India has become popular.
15316,Online education can be useful but it cannot replace the human touch and warmth of the classroom.
15317,Covid-19 is a disaster for students and teachers.
15318,Face-to-face classes and schools are important for many reasons.
15319,"In ancient India, there was a strong emphasis on the relationship between the Guru and Shishya."
15320,It is important for children to be physically and mentally active in order to gain the benefits of education.
15321,"The hybrid education model, in which classes are conducted online and offline, is needed to promote critical thinking, imagination and innovation among students."
15322,Rural India has the lowest digital literacy among parents.
15323,"Therefore, conscious policy decisions are required to support online education infrastructure by ensuring internet connectivity."
15324,India has lagged behind in the development of the Industrial Revolution 4.0.
15325,Digital India aims to provide every citizen with technological entitlements to improve the quality of life.
15326,‘Information’ is the main commodity in this knowledge society. The pace of dissemination and access to it are the key determinants of the quality of present-day life. Digitalization is the medium of access to such information.
15327,The telecom revolution in our country has transformed the way of life and is adding to the ‘smartness’ of living.
15328,The country is undergoing a profound and rapid transformation.
15329,Every social order is inherently inequitable. The goal of guided ‘socio-economic’ transformation is to minimize the inherent inequalities. Digitalization is a new factor of change and needs to be handled properly.
15330,"In this ‘information age’, the main challenges are; digital infrastructure, digital literacy and digital access that make or mar the ongoing revolution."
15331,The pandemic forced people to learn how to keep the socio-economic process going in times of adversity.
15332,This experience of living with corona has raised questions about how many people are equipped to live the digital way.
15333,"There has been extensive use of digital technology in different sectors since the pandemic. The courts in India continue to function using technology. The district courts have heard more than 35 lakh cases, the High Courts more than 14,000 cases and the Supreme Court more than 30,000."
15334,The educational institutions are increasingly using technology. E-medicine has found new traction.
15335,e-delivery of government services and entitlements in our country is proving to be effective with huge gains.
15336,"In the digital age, we should not miss out on the essence of life."
15337,Improved access to the net adds to GDP growth. Internet revolution can add up to one trillion dollars to the GDP by 2025.
15338,"To enable the inevitable course of ‘digitalization’ to be more equal, the Government of India has launched several programmes aimed at improving infrastructure, literacy, access etc."
15339,The New Education Policy (NEP) 2020 proposes integration of technology in a big way for enhancing learning outcomes.
15340,Corona has taught lessons on how to create an equitable digital eco-system in the country.
15341,The governments and private sector need to work on appropriate models for collective effort to enable a ‘digital India’ which gives every citizen her or his due.
15342,Shankaracharya was a great teacher of Hindu philosophy.
15343,Digitalisation is a powerful tool to lift the norms of our living to a new normal. It should be used to reduce the drudgery of living and enhancing individual's contribution to the collective well-being.
15344,"To fully realize the benefits of digital technology, the ‘dualities’ in the form of differences of access and ability shall be removed."
15345,Let us strive for a ‘Digital India’ that belongs and benefits all Indians and also the citizens of the world.
15346,Adi Shankara Group of Institutions is grooming the leaders of tomorrow. The latest initiative of the group is the Adi Shankaracharya Digital Academy.
15347,I hope this Academy will live up to the people’s expectations and help create skilled manpower for 21st century needs.

15374,The degree you got is not enough. You will be expected to use the skills you have learned and acquired.

15377,"For those of you seeking to become job creators, India is the best place to implement your business ideas."
15378,Education without values is no education at all.
15379,The holistic solution to combat climate change should include a value-based education that respects nature.

15391,"Let me conclude by recalling the famous words of Swami Vivekananda: “Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached”."
15392,"None including the Judiciary is supreme, only the Constitution is; asserts the Vice President"
15393,"Some judicial verdicts gave a distinct impression of overreach, says Shri Venkaiah NaiduDespite shifting of Question Hour in Rajya Sabha, 60% of it is still lost due to disruptions, says ChairmanShri Naidu urges Presiding Officers to uphold the sanctity of ‘temples of democracy’Asks political parties to introspect to enable disruption free legislaturesLauding Department Related Standing Committees of Parliament, asks Presiding Officers to ensure Committee System in all the legislatures of the country"
15394,"Neither the legislature, the executive nor the judiciary can claim to be supreme."
15395,Shri Naidu has expressed concern over the functioning of the legislatures.
15396,The political parties should introspect about the present state of affairs to enhance the standing of legislatures and legislators and to ensure disruption free functioning of legislatures.
15397,"There were disruptions in the Rajya Sabha during 2010-14. The Question Hour was shifted to 12.00 noon from 11.00 am in 2014, but 60% of the precious time was lost due to disruptions and forced adjournments."
15398,Shri Naidu is concerned about the declining use of Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha.
15399,"Shri Naidu believes that democracy will be upheld only through adherence to the other three ‘Ds’ namely, Debate, Discuss and Decide."
15400,"Noting that the Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees of Parliament, introduced in 1993 have been making a significant contribution by undertaking on behalf of the Parliament, detailed scrutiny of Bills, Demands for Grants and other issues chosen by the Committees,"
15401,Shri Naidu urged the Presiding Officers to ensure introduction of such committee system in all the States.
15402,The Vice President has warned that there are instances when the legislative branch interferes with the functions of the executive and judiciary.
15403,Shri Naidu believes that the Supreme Court is not the first among equals and the Constitution is supreme.
15404,The Vice President has expressed concern about judicial pronouncements that might have an overreach.
15405,Shri Naidu has criticised some instances of judicial overreach.
15406,Following is the full text of the speech – 
15407,"“Mahamahim Rashtrapati ji, Hon’ble Speaker of Lok Sabha, Respected Presiding Officers of State Legislatures from across the country, friends from media, Brothers and Sisters!"
15408,The Presiding Officers' Assembly is celebrating 80th edition.
15409,"The State is in its best state when each of the three organs of the State performs to the best of its potential in the domain specified for each of them, in pursuit of the mandate defined in the Constitution."
15410,"The theory of “Separation of Powers” by Montesquieu was intended to prevent autocracy and tyranny. However, the legislative and executive functions continued to be in the same hands till the middle of the 19th century. Ever since India became an independent state, there have been tensions and tensions."
15411,Harmony lies in each organ doing its job without interfering with that of the others.
15412,The Executive oversteps its responsibilities to the Legislature. There have been cases when the Rules framed under the delegated ‘Subordinate Legislation’ violated the provisions of original legislation.
15413,"The 39th Constitution Amendment placing the election of President, Vice President and Prime Minister beyond the scope of judicial scrutiny in the circumstances in 1975 is one such instance."
15414,There have been some judicial pronouncements that gave the impression of an over reach.
15415,The actions of the three organs of the State have blurred the boundaries demarcated by the constitution.
15416,The moot question is does our Constitution envisage any of these three to be ‘supreme’?
15417,The Supreme Court has always held that the three organs of the State do not share the functions that belong to another.
15418,That quest for harmony is the theme of deliberation at this august assembly.
15419,The quest for peaceful co-existence is not new for Indians.
15420,“Samani va akutih samana hrdayni vah |
15421,"(Let us be driven by a common goal, united with a common commitment and inspired by ennobling thoughts to work together with harmony and in a cheerful environment)."
15422,"Once each organ has an overarching goal and has the larger public interest in view, the foundation for a synergistic functioning will be laid."
15423,"Since independence, the Supreme Court and High Courts have delivered several far reaching verdicts in furtherance of socio-economic objectives besides making correctional interventions. Recently, there have been debates whether some issues should have been left to the other organs of the government."
15424,The judiciary in India has been accused of overreaching in recent times.
15425,There are concerns about the harmony in the working of the three organs of the State. The Constitution provides for checks and balances to ensure playing by the rules and harmony among the three States. The issues concerning the Presiding Officers and the legislatures should be discussed by the President.
15426,The business of legislatures is serious in nature as they discuss the ways we ought to live. Law makers have the right to defend their territory and to nullify judicial decisions.
15427,The Presiding Officers are elected representatives of the people and they represent the people in parliament.
15428,"On the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of our independence in 1997, both Houses of Parliament adopted a resolution on the issue of Question Hour."
15429,"Citing frequent disruption of the Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha, it was shifted from 11.00 am to 12.00 noon in 2014. However, only 26.25% of the valuable time was used in the next year."
15430,The system of Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees (DRSCs) was introduced in 1993. Now there are 24 DRSCs in Parliament. I have been reviewing the performance of 8 Rajya Sabha Committees and they have shown substantial improvement.
15431,"In the Rig Veda, Sabha Adhyaksha is defined as someone well versed in the matters of State, experienced, astute, not a novice in politics, impartial, learned, righteous, benevolent and mature by advanced age and learning. I am distressed over the state of affairs in several state legislatures."
15432,"“Decency, Dignity and Decorum” of the temples of democracy will be upheld only through adherence to three ‘Ds’ namely, “Debate, Discus and Decide”. "
15433,Lok Sabha Speaker organises Conference of Presiding Officers on harmonious functioning of the three organs of the State for nation building.

15463,"With the economies of India and rest of the world trying to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for all nations, particularly those in South Asia, to come together to promote peace, eradicate poverty, improve socio-economic conditions and wipe out the menace of terrorism."

16332,You yourself close the door for something new if you move ahead with pre-conceived notions.
16333,"It was twenty years ago that I became the chief minister of Gujarat. I used to live in Delhi, but when I came to Gujarat, I had no place to stay, so I booked a room in Circuit House in Gandhi Nagar."
16334,There is a serious problem with electricity supply in Nigeria. The situation is not permanent. I was talking to officers and they cannot find a permanent solution. I asked them if they could do anything to solve the problem apart from separating the agriculture and domestic feeders.
16335,The officers did not agree with me that it can't be done. The files which I moved around for this purpose must have weighed 5-7-10 kilograms.
16336,I want to separate the domestic and agriculture feeders of electricity which reaches villages. I need to get approval of 10 crores rupees from the Gujarat government.
16337,"They started the work. The electricity supply was separated for agriculture and domestic use. Nowadays, Gujarat has 24-hour electricity supply."
16338,This experiment changed the mindset of the officers. Then we formulated a 1000-day plan for the entire Gujarat when agriculture and domestic feeder will be separated. 24-hour electricity was ensured in all the households of Gujarat.
16339,"Friends, keep one thing in mind that restrictions don't matter, your response matters. Gujarat was the first state which prepared solar policy at its own level. It was then brought to our notice that it will cost 12-13 rupees per unit of solar power. Thermal power was available for 2-3 rupees."
16340,"But friends, there was a moment when I had to change my lifestyle in order to protect my prestige and the concerns of future generation."
16341,"At last, we took the decision to go for solar energy."
16342,"The Indian government fixed the price for solar panels in Gujarat at Rs. 18-19. The price of solar panels can be reduced to Rs. 12-13. Now, you can see the progress made by Gujarat in solar power generation."
16343,"What started at Rs. 12-13 became the solar movement across the country and after coming here, I formed the International Solar Alliance with 80-85 member countries. Since it was done with clean heart conviction, India is making giant strides as far as solar power is concerned."
16344,I am confident that the country will meet its 175 gigawatt renewable energy target by 2022. The country has set a huge target of 450 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030.
16345,There is no such thing as cannot happen.
16346,Even small changes bring about big changes.
16347,"It may be just 20 minutes in a day, but it's equal to 120 hours in a year."
16348,"When a team is chasing a big target, it doesn't think about how many runs it has to score to win."
16349,"The same mantra is followed by many people in financial planning. They deposit Rs. 5,000 every month and it becomes more than one lakh rupees after two years."
16350,"When a country moves ahead with similar sustained efforts at the national level, results are also similar. For example, the Swachh Bharat mission."
16351,"In the 21st century, the world's hopes and expectations are from India and India's hopes are associated with you. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji had given the vision of “Antyodaya”. "

16537,"Mr Michael Bloomberg,Thought leaders,Captains of Industry,Distinguished participants of theBloomberg New Economic Forum."
16538,I begin by expressing my appreciation for the great workbeing done by Michael and his team atBloomberg Philanthropies.The support provided by this team in designing ofIndia’s Smart Cities Missionhas been very good.
16539,"We are at a very important pointin our history.More than half of the world’s citizensalready live in urban areas.Over the next two decades,India and some of the African nationsare going to witnessthe biggest wave of urbanization.But the COVID -19 pandemic has posed enormous challengesbefore the world.It has shown usthat cities,which were our growth enginesare also our vulnerable zones.Many cities around the worlddeclared themselves on the brink ofthe worst economic downturnsince the Great Depression.The very thingswhich represented living in a cityare facing a question mark.Things like community gatherings,sports activities,education and recreation are not the same as before.The biggest questionbefore the entire worldis how to restart? The restart will not be possiblewithout a reset.A reset of mindset.A reset of processes.And a reset of practices."
16540,"I think the historic reconstruction efforts after the two world warscan give us several lessons.Post world wars,the entire world workedon a new world order.New protocols were developedand world changed itself.COVID-19 has also given usa similar opportunity to developnew protocols in every field.This opportunity should be grabbedby the worldif we want to developresilient systems for the future.We should think onpost COVID requirements of the world.A good starting pointwould be the rejuvenationof our urban centers."
16541,"Here,I want to sharea positive side of Indian cities.Indian cities have presentedan extra-ordinary exampleduring these tough times.There were world-wideincidents of resistance against the lockdown measures.However Indian citiesmeticulously followed these preventive measures.This is because,for us, the biggest building blockof our citieswas not concrete,but the community.The pandemic has re-emphasised that our biggest resource,as societies and as businesses,is our people.The post-Covid worldhas to be built by nurturing this key and fundamental resource.Cities are vibrant engines of growth.They hold the power to drivethis much-needed change."
16542,"People often migrate to citiesbecause cities give them work.But,isn’t it time that we also makecities work for the people? Covid-19 has given a chanceto accelerate our process ofmaking cities more liveable for people.This includes better housing facilities,better work environment,shorter and efficient travel.During the lockdown,many cities saw cleaner lakes & riversas well as cleaner air.So many of us saw the chirping of birdswe never noticed before.Can we not build sustainable citieswhere these features are the normand not exception? It has beenour endeavour in India to build urban centres,which have the amenities of a city but the spirit of a village."
16543,"During the pandemic,technology has also helped usmaintain continuity in our work.Thanks to a simple toollike video-conferencing,I can wrap up many more meetings.This has also helped mebridge the distanceand talk to all of you.But this also posesan interesting questionfor a post-Covid world.Will we continuewith the learnings of the Covid-times like Video-Conferencing? Or will we travel across continentsto participate in a conference? Reducing stress on urban systemswill depend on our choices."
16544,"These choices will also help usmaintain a better work- life balance.In today's age, empowering people to work from anywhere, to live anywhere,to plug into global supply chains from anywhereis an absolute necessity.That is why we have announcedsimplified guidelines for the technologyand knowledge-enabled services sector.This will facilitate'Work from Home'and 'Work from Anywhere'."
16545,"Our cities cannot prosper without availability of Affordable Housing.Realizing this,we launched the Housing for Allprogram in 2015.I am happy to notethat we are well on our way.We will deliver more than one crore or 10 million houses to aspiring families in urban areasbefore the targeted deadline of 2022.Looking at the conditions created by the pandemic,we also introduced an affordable rental housing initiative.We created the Real Estate Regulation Act.This has transformedthe dynamics of the real estate sector.Also this has made itmore customer-orientedand transparent."
16546,Sustainable mobility is key to creating resilient cities.The work on Metro Rail is going on in 27 cities.We are on track to deliverclose to 1000 kms of Metro Rail systemin the country by 2022.Our Make in India push has led to development of tremendous indigenous capacityfor production of transportation systems.It is going to help us pushour sustainable transport goals in a big way.
16547,"Technology is an important enabler in the journey of a smart,prosperous and resilient city.Technology helps managea city efficiently and build connected communities.We are looking at a futurewhere a major chunk of education,healthcare,shopping, food experiencesmay happen online.Our cities need to be readyfor the convergenceof the physicaland digital worlds.Our programs– Digital India and Start-Up India Missionsare helping create capacities towards this.We have selected 100 Smart Citiesthrough a two-stage process.It was a nationwide competitionupholding the philosophy of cooperative and competitive federalism."
16548,"These cities have prepared projectsworth almost two lakh crore rupeesor 30 billion dollars.And projects worth almostone lakh forty thousand crore rupeesor 20 billion dollarshave been completed or nearing completion.To unleash the full potential of technology,Integrated Command and Control centershave been set-up in many cities.These centers are currently also serving as war-rooms to manage the Covid situation in various cities."
16549,"Lastly,I would like to remind one thing to all of you.If you are looking to invest in urbanisation,India has exciting opportunities for you.If you are looking to invest in mobility,India has exciting opportunities for you.If you are looking to invest in innovation, India has exciting opportunities for you.If you are looking to invest in sustainable solutions, India has exciting opportunities for you.These opportunities come along-with A vibrant democracy.A business friendly climate.A huge market.And a governmentwhich shall leave no stone unturned to make India a preferred global investment destination."
16550,"India is well on its way towards urban transformation.I have no doubt thatwith the help of all stake-holders,the civil society, academic institutions,industry and most importantly the citizens and communities,we will achieve the dream of resilient and prosperous global cities."
