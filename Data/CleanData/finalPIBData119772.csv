231,"Shri Naidu noted that the Society, established in Pune in 1860, was one of the first private educational institutions to be formed in the country, with the efforts of stalwarts such as the great “Adya Krantikarak” Shri Vasudeo Balavant Phadke, with the intention of imparting scientific education to the youth and fostering nationalist values among people."
232,"Shri Naidu has paid tribute to Shri Vasudev Balwant Phadke, who fought for India's independence from British rule."
233,Maharashtra has produced leaders and organisations that contribute to the development of India.
234,"Observing that institutions such as the Maharashtra Education Society, the Deccan Education Society and others took ‘education as a mission’, Shri Naidu called for a similar spirit now to further the cause of education."
235,"Stressing the need for a ‘21st century touch’ to the education sector, the Vice President urged an enthusiastic implementation of National Education Policy 2020 by States and educational institutions, with emphasis on interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity."
236,"Noting that the pandemic has necessitated the use of digital classrooms, smart devices and micro courses, he observed that the mode of education cannot be status quoist anymore and called upon private and public educational institutions to adopt these new hybrid standards in education."
237,Vocational courses and distance education delivered through modern technologies can bridge geographical barriers and reach remote areas.
238,"Shri Rajeev Sahasrabudhe, Chairman of Governing Body, MES, Dr. Bharat Vhankate, Secretary of MES and Shri Sudhir Gade, Assistant Secretary of the MES attended the event. Ketaki Modak is the author of the book."
239,Following is the full text of the speech:
240,"I congratulate the management of Maharashtra Education Society (MES) and the author, Dr Ketaki Modak, on the release of a book on the 160-year-old history of the society."
241,"I am sure this book will serve as a useful reference tool for readers to trace the evolution of MES from its humble roots, while recounting various stirring anecdotes in its journey over 160 years."
242,"It is pertinent to recall that the Maharashtra Education Society was one of the first private educational institutions in Pune, established way back in 1860 with efforts of stalwarts such as the great “Adya Krantikarak” Shri Vasudeo Balavant Phadke, among others."
243,The institution was established to promote the values of nationalism among people.
244,This organisation was not the exception. 
245,The establishment of such institutions eventually led to a wave of nationalism and aroused the patriotic spirit of our great freedom fighters in the years to come.
246,"Their work in democratising education, fighting social evils and spreading scientific temper, challenging the administration on just causes and engendering social reform continued to reap benefits for the region and inspired similar movements elsewhere in the country too."
247,It is no exaggeration to say that Maharashtra was at the forefront in producing such leaders and organisations during the Indian Renaissance and laying the ideological foundations for the freedom struggle over the next century.
248,"At a time when we are honouring our national heroes through Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, we must not forget the role of these unsung leaders such as MG Ranade, Vasudev Balwant Phadke, and others."
249,"Shri Vasudev Balwant Phadke, one of the founding members of this organisation, was a revolutionary who fought for India's independence from British rule."
250,The lives of freedom fighters should be preserved in school textbooks to teach children about their lives.
251,History is a powerful teacher of human potential.
252,"One of the noblest aspects of institutions such as the Maharashtra Education Society, the Deccan Education Society and other such organisations is that education for them was a mission."
253,They understood that imparting modern scientific education to the youth was an important way of empowering India with a weapon to fight the British.
254,"I am glad to know that the Maharashtra Education Society is continuing its patriotic mission even today, which is clear from the impressive list of distinguished alumni its institutions boast of."
255,Education needs to be driven by the same missionary spirit today as it was in the 19th century.
256,The National Education Policy 2020 is an important milestone.
257,"By emphasising on interdisciplinarity and multi-discipline, NEP is well-poised to help India reach its demographic dividend. States and educational institutions must enthusiastically implement the provisions of NEP."
258,The pandemic has taught us that the mode of education cannot be status quoist anymore. Vocational courses and distance education delivered through modern technologies can bridge geographical barriers and reach remote areas.
259,"In conclusion, I am happy to have released this book today."
260,I hope this will inspire many more books on the origins of our various historical organisations.
261,"My best wishes to the Maharashtra Education Society, the publishers and the author for their future endeavours."

428,"The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme was launched on this day three years ago. Since then, more than 1.45 Lakh Crores worth of subsidies have been given to 11 crore farmers. Direct money transfer for 10-12 crore farmers with just one click is a pride for any Indian."
429,"In the last seven years, we have developed many new systems related to providing seeds and ensuring markets and improved the old systems. The agricultural budget has increased manifold in six years. Agricultural loans for farmers have also been increased by 2.5 times. Three crore small farmers have access to KCC."
430,The government promotes organic farming and exports.
431,This year's Agriculture Budget continues the efforts of the previous years and amplifies them. Seven ways have been suggested in this year's budget to make agriculture modern and smart.
432,The aim is to promote natural farming on mission mode within a radius of 5 km on both the banks of the Ganges. Emphasis is being laid on herbal medicine and fruits and flowers.
433,Second- Farmers will be provided with modern technology in agriculture and horticulture.
434,"Third - In order to reduce the import of edible oil, this year’s budget lays special emphasis on strengthening the Mission Oil Palm as well as oilseeds."
435,The fourth goal is to provide new logistics arrangements for the transportation of agricultural products under the PM GatiShakti plan.
436,The fifth solution that has been offered in the budget is that agri-waste management will be organized further and the income of farmers will be increased through measures like waste to energy.
437,"The sixth solution is that more than 1.5 lakh post offices of the country will get facilities of regular banks, so that farmers do not face any problem."
438,And seventh is that skill development and human resource development in the syllabus related to agri research and education will be changed according to today's modern times.
439,Health awareness is increasing in the world today. Natural farming and organic farming are growing in demand. Krishi Vigyan Kendras and agriculture universities will have to mobilize with full force to take the benefits of natural farming to the masses.
440,"In our middle and upper-middle-class families, protein and calcium products from abroad are now on their dining table. All these products are available here that our farmers produce, but they are not presented in a right way and marketed according to Indian taste. Therefore, we should attempt to prioritize ‘Vocal for Local’ in it."
441,Many people do not know about Indian food or the variety of products found in it.
442,The year 2023 is International Year of Millets. The corporate world should come forward to promote India's millets. Indian missions abroad should organize seminars and webinars with importers and exporters to promote millets and coarse grains.
443,The government has provided soil health cards to crores of farmers of the country. There should be continuous testing of soil health.
444,The government should increase awareness among farmers about the use of pesticides and fertilizers.
445,The government should accelerate the implementation of micro-irrigation in the country.
446,The government has set a target to increase edible oil production by 50% in the next 3-4 years.
447,There should be a study of the food requirements of India. The corporate world should come forward to promote agri-investors and farmers to promote crop diversification.
448,Artificial Intelligence is going to change the trade related to agriculture and farming in the 21st century. Kisan Drones will be available only when agri start-ups are promoted.
449,The Post-Harvest Management Programme aims to improve the quality of processed food and increase cooperation in food processing.
450,The management of land used for agriculture is important. New measures have been taken in this year's budget to reduce carbon emission and increase income of farmers.
451,"It would be easier for the farmers to accept the solutions regarding the management of stubble if it was discussed. Post-Harvesting Waste is a big challenge for farmers. Therefore, it is important to keep expanding and promoting the systems of logistics and storage."
452,The government is doing a lot in this regard but private sector should step up its contribution. I would like to see banks and private players involved in the agriculture sector prioritising it.
453,Innovation and packaging in agriculture are two areas that need more attention. Corporate houses and agri start-ups should come forward in large numbers in fruit packaging. They should help farmers to plan accordingly with the agri-waste.
454,India has huge potential for investment in food processing and ethanol. The government is giving a lot of incentives to increase ethanol blending.
455,Packaging of natural juices is important.
456,The cooperative sector in India has a lot of scope to create a vibrant business entity. The government has created a new ministry dedicated to this sector.
457,I request micro-financing institutions to provide maximum financial support to agri start-ups and Farmers Producers Organizations.
458,Corporations should step up their efforts to help the farmers who rent farm equipment.
459,The government wants to encourage farmers to grow timber in a scientific way.
460,The seminar on agriculture is being held in Islamabad. The main topic will be on increasing income of farmers and providing modern facilities to them.

It would have been better for the country if you had raised this concern during the Congress-led UPA government. In the last five years of the Congress government, the country had to face double-digit inflation for almost the entire term. In 2011, the then Finance Minister had shamelessly told people not to expect any Aladdin magic to bring down inflation."

1053,The country which is north of the sea and south of the Himalayas is called India and their children are called Indians.
1054,Enormous attempts were made to set the Tamil sentiment on fire here. The tradition of the Congress for politics is seen in the legacy of the British. The great poet of Tamil language and freedom fighter Subramanya Bharathi ji said-
1055,I translate what he has said in the Tamil language:
1056,The expository Upanishads are our prized treasure
1057,The entire world doesn't have any work of that measure.
1058,"Oh, the Golden Bharath is verily our own land"
1059,"Hail our land, we are of a matchless brand!!"

1064,"People have come and gone for selfish reasons. The country is immortal, nothing can happen to it."
1065,An objection has been raised in the matter of duties.
1066,Modi quotes Nehru ji on duties.
1067,"Pandit Nehru ji, the first Prime Minister of the country, said that there is a free Hindustan, but with freedom arises responsibility."
1068,I don't want to take too much time in the House as members are tired.
1069,The period of 75 years of independence is a positive contribution in the development journey of India. Congress and its allies are destroying this important moment of history.

9614,The National Ropeways Development Programme - “Parvatmala” - will be taken up on Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. 8 projects for 60 km of ropeway will be awarded in 2022-23.
9615,MAJOR FACTORS DRIVING ROPEWAY INFRASTRUCTURE
9616,Routes are economical mode of transportation.
9617,"Faster mode of transportation: Owing to the aerial mode of transportation, ropeways have an advantage over roadway projects where ropeways can be built in a straight line, over a hilly terrain."
9618,Material containers can be designed so as to exclude any soiling of the environment.
9619,Last mile connectivity: Ropeway projects adopting 3S (a kind of cable car system) or equivalent technologies can transport 6000-8000 passengers per hour.
9620,Ideal for difficult / challenging / sensitive terrain
9621,"Long rope spans: The system crosses obstacles like rivers, buildings, ravines, or roads without a problem."
9622,"Ropes guided over towers: Low space requirements on the ground, and no barrier for humans or animals."
9623,People living in difficult areas will be able to sell their produce to other areas.
9624,"Ropeway is a form of car transport. Ropeway having multiple cars propelled by a single power-plant and drive mechanism reduces both construction and maintenance costs. On level ground, ropeways are competitive with narrow-gauge railroads, but in the mountains they are far superior."
9625,Flexible: Transport of different materials - A ropeway allows for the simultaneous transport of different types of material.
9626,Ropeways and cableways can handle large slopes and large differences in elevation.
9627,"Low footprint: The fact that only narrow-based vertical supports are needed at intervals, leaving the rest of the ground free, makes it possible for ropeways to be constructed in built-up areas and in places where there is intense competition for land use."
9628,MORTH has initiated a study carried out by M/s Mckinsey & Co. for Ropeway development in the country. MORTH has signed an MoU with Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board (UTDB) for development of Ropeways in the State. DPR for Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib Ropway is in progress.

15151,"On fisheries, there would be a check on illegal unreported and unregulated fishing in our waters and elsewhere. There would be strict controls on overfished areas. No subsidies to be provided for fishing in areas outside EEZ or RFMOs."
15152,"The decision on TRIPS will boost export, vaccine equity, accessibility and affordability."
15153,"The agenda decided on WTO reforms will make the WTO a more efficient and agile body. The dispute settlement body will be revived and play its expected role in settling trade disputes. A reference to Gender, Environment and MSME is made in the WTO reform agenda."
15154,"On e-Commerce, while agreeing to the temporary moratorium, India asked for intensifying discussions on the moratorium including on its scope, definition and impact for taking an informed decision on the same."
15155,"The Food Security Declaration, focusses on making food available in developing countries while working towards increasing productivity and production "
15156,"As regards the World Food Programme (WFP), there will be no export restrictions on WFP purchases for food security in other countries, but domestic food security will take priority."
15157,Statement by Shri Piyush Goyal at the WTO 12th Ministerial Conference in the Thematic Session on WTO Reform
15158,"Following is the text of the Statement made by the Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal at the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Geneva during the Thematic Session on WTO Reform: "
15159,"""We are all agreed that the primary objective of the WTO is to serve as the mechanism through which international trade can become the means for supporting economic development of Members, particularly the developing countries and the LDCs."
15160,"We need to accord priority to the reform needs especially to the crisis at the Appellate body, whose functioning should become more transparent and effective, the number of suggestions for reforming the WTO could result in fundamental changes in the institutional architecture thereby, running the risk of skewing the system against the interest of developing countries."
15161,"The principles of non-discrimination, predictibilty, transparency and the commitment to development underlying the multilateral trading system are sacrosant."
15162,"In all such reforms, we must ensure that multilateral rule making processes are neither bypassed nor diluted."
15163,All developing countries have a treaty-embedded and non-negotiable right for special and differential treatment.
15164,India and the United States should agree to address the existing asymmetries implicit in the Uruguay Round agreements.
15165,"In conclusion, as I hear many members' interventions the sense I get is that most of us are suggesting that the reform process should take place in the General Council and its regular bodies, as the General Council has the authority to act on the behalf of the ministers and reforms discussions must not be held with the aim of undermining the authority of the existing bodies of the WTO."""
15166,"Overall Merchandise and Services Exports jump 24% in May, 2022;"
15167,"Merchandise exports grow by 20%; Services exports up 30%Petroleum products, Electronic goods, Leather products, coffee, cereal preparations and oil meals lead the way in exports growth"

15169,Statement by Shri Piyush Goyal during the WTO 12th Ministerial Conference at the meeting with co-sponsors of TRIPS Waiver 
15170,"Following is the text of the Statement made by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal during the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Geneva at the meeting with co-sponsors of TRIPS Waiver today:"
15171,"“The developed world has been engaging with the developed world to try to find solutions. I have been trying to get a sense of where this is heading both in the quadrilateral meetings, in my bilaterals with various ministers and governments, and also in the green room. I want to share a few disturbing things to share with you before we take a final decision."
15172,The developed world is keen to show to the developing countries that it cares about them.
15173,The effort of the government to showcase to the world that it has found a solution to the problem of compulsory licensing is nothing near a TRIPS waiver.
15174,There was a lot of nitpicking during the discussion about the agreement that we are trying to negotiate.
15175,The kind of fights that there are going to be during the 5 years of the agreement are worrying.
15176,"It will take 2.5-3 years to get the necessary funds and invest in a vaccine production. After that, the plant will have to produce and export. India has a lot of vaccine capacity idling."
15177,The developed world is pushing for IP rights for diagnostics and therapeutics.
15178,Their expectation is that COVID-19 is increasingly being well managed and their hope is that issue will lose relevance.
15179,Vaccine story is almost over. Many parts of the world are paying much more for vaccines than in India where a vaccine gets produced for a $1.5.
15180,"Vaccines have lost relevance, they spent 2 years without giving a solution and there is no demand for them anymore."
15181,Statement by Shri Piyush Goyal at the WTO 12th Ministerial Conference during the Thematic Session on Agriculture
15182,"Following is the text of the Statement made by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal at the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Geneva during the Thematic Session on Agriculture today:"
15183,“We are discussing one of the most critical issues under negotiations which has a direct impact on the lives of millions of people across the globe.
15184,"Agriculture is not just a source of livelihood for most of the farmers and farm workers in developing countries, it is also important for their food security, their nutrition and in a sense for developing nations and the people at large."
15185,Egypt and Sri Lanka need to see if draft declarations and decisions under consideration will help improve food availability.
15186,"In fact, these two Members have not agreed on the draft Food Security Declaration, but they have called for an immediate Permanent solution to the Public Stockholding issue."
15187,"We are in a situation, where the temporary declarations are not going to help the countries rather the Permanent Solution to Public Stock Holding, pending for more than 9 years, is not yet being taken up for closure."
15188,India has had an experience of becoming a food self-sufficient nation thanks to state support. India is fighting on behalf of developing countries including the LDCs.
15189,"What we are discussing are the rules of an agreement largely suited to the developed countries, which work for their socio-economic situation already give higher entitlement for the developed world and the calculations under which the developed world is questioned are flawed based on certain situations prevailing 35 years ago and without any relevance to today's situation in either terms of growth in prices, inflation, changing dynamics with absolutely no system of calibrating it over the years, we landed up freezing that at the 86 levels and today we are suffering the consequences of that."
15190,"The ministerial conference of 11 December 2013 decided to put in place an interim mechanism to negotiate on a permanent solution for adoption by the 11th ministerial conference. In lieu of agreement on trade facilitation with the developed world, they compromised and settled on their trade agreement and for public stockholding."
15191,"In para 8, members agreed to establish a work program to be undertaken in the committee on agriculture to pursue this issue with the aim of making recommendations for a permanent solution. Para 9 says they commit to the work program with the intention of concluding it no later than the 11th Ministerial Conference. Paras 10 and 11 state that the general council shall report to the 10th ministerial conference the progress made on the work."
15192,The organisation is in the 12th MC. It's almost time for the 13th MC but they haven't finalised the permanent solution yet.
15193,"WTO is an organisation for trade, but one should remember that before trade, there comes hunger and one cannot tread the path of trade on an empty stomach."
15194,"Leading up to the MC 12, more than 80 countries have come together for taking the issue of Public Stockholding to a logical conclusion and directly addressing the food insecurity concerns."
15195,"It is ironical that the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) provides considerable flexibility to the developed members to provide huge subsidies in the form of Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) and further, to concentrate these subsidies on a few products, without limit, but the same flexibilities are not available to majority of the developing countries including LDCs."
15196,The fear mongering in the name of trade distortion by the former is pointless.
15197,There are vast differences in the actual per farmer domestic support being provided by different countries. Developed countries are giving more than 200 times the support than developing countries.
15198,Some members of the House of Representatives want to reduce farmers' share in state support.
15199,The special and differential treatment accorded to developing countries remains crucial for us and hence bringing it into the ambit of negotiations is just not acceptable.
15200,We feel that the draft Ministerial Decisions on Agriculture is expansive and goes beyond the Doha Round mandate and does not acknowledge the progress achieved so far.
15201,"On the proposal for providing exemption to World Food Programme from export restrictions, India supports such exemptions, but wants to also provide for G2G transactions."
15202,"I would urge the membership of the WTO to seriously reflect on this programme of permanent solution to public stockholding being finalised at the MC 12, sending a message to the world that we do care, we care for the poor, we care for the vulnerable, we care for food security, we care for a far more balanced & equitable future for the rest of the world.”"
15203,Intervention by Shri Piyush Goyal on Fisheries Subsidies Negotiations during the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Geneva
15204,"Following is the text of the Intervention made by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal on Fisheries Subsidies Negotiations during the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Geneva:"
15205,"“India is a strong advocate of sustainability. Many nations from both hemispheres allowed their gigantic industrial fleets to exploit and plunder the ocean's wealth over the past several decades, whereas India maintained fleets of modest size that largely fished in its Exclusive Economic Zone, operating with passive gear and leaving bare minimum footprints on the seascape."
15206,There is a great disparity in the amount of subsidies given to fishermen by different nations for different levels of fishing.
15207,India's fisheries sector is traditional and small-scale in nature and we are essentially one of the disciplined nations in sustainably harnessing the fisheries resources.
15208,"Excellencies, India's engagement in the sustainable harnessing of its fish and aquatic resources is exemplary."
15209,Fishing is stopped from 1st June to 31st July on the West coast and from 15th April to 14th June in the Bay of Bengal. Indian Fishers practice voluntary restraint for 61 days a year to allow fish to grow and regenerate.
15210,The exercise being carried out now has not provided a level-playing field to the developing nations to address the aspirations of traditional fishers and their livelihoods.
15211,The present RFMO text allows countries to continue over-exploiting the fisheries resources in others' EEZ and the high seas indefinitely.
15212,India is opposed to the current text and the way De minimis is sought to be institutionalized.
15213,"In India, fisheries are sustainable."
15214,The Indian government would like to reiterate its position that advanced fishing nations own the responsibility for the damage caused to global fisheries wealth.
15215,"In this context, we would like to emphasize that ‘common but differentiated responsibility’ and ‘polluter pays principle’ should be the bedrock of any agreement related to sustainability."
15216,India would like to see a moratorium on giving subsidies for 25 years for fishing or fishing-related activities beyond their EEZ.
15217,It would be a matter of great concern for India such Distant Water Fishing Nations are provided carve out under the shelter of conservation and management measures in the draft Ministerial Text on fisheries subsidies (article 5.1.1).
15218,"On the contrary, we see from the current text that the subsidies extended by developing countries to their small-scale and artisanal fishermen for meeting their genuine needs and enabling their access to fishing for livelihoods in their own EEZ is subjected to scrutiny and the onerous responsibility to demonstrate sustainability."
15219,Subsidies to poor fishing communities reduce vulnerability of the communities to overfishing.
15220,Tropical waters are different from temperate waters and the regeneration of the fish stocks is faster.
15221,"De-minimis on the global catch basis without considering the fishing, the fishermen families involved, the size of the nation and the de-minis should be completely arbitrary and unfair."
15222,The Agreement proposes to limit specific fuel subsidies to 22% of total fisheries subsidies and leave out non-specific fuel subsidies. This would be contrary to SDG 14.6 and the resolve to stop subsidies for IUU fishing.
15223,The transition period of 25 years sought by India is a must-have for other non-distant water fishing countries.
15224,"The exemption from disciplines for low income, resource poor, small-scale and artisanal fishers and nations not involved in long distance fishing up to 200 nautical miles is essential to provide socio-economic security to vulnerable communities. "
15225,The outcome of the exercise should provide a level-playing field to developing nations to ensure that their small-scale and artisanal fishing fleets are sustained and their livelihoods are not threatened.
15226,"The United Nations General Assembly declared 2022 as the International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture. India would like to ensure that the outcomes of the fisheries subsidies negotiations provide the right support, balance and equity for artisanal and small-scale fishers."

15271,India makes a strong pitch for protecting the interests of the developing and under-developed countries at the WTO
15272,"Shri Piyush Goyal does some plain speaking at the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in GenevaRaises concerns about the “skewed” WTO reforms proposal, need to retain the S&DT provisions for the developing world, global inequities in Covid vaccination and Public Stockholding of food grains“Current proposals for WTO Reform could fundamentally change its institutional architecture, skewing the system against the interests of developing countries”: Shri GoyalCOVID Pandemic has exposed the inability of the world to promptly respond to any crisis, whether on food security or health, economic well being or open supply chains, says Shri GoyalShri Goyal proposes adopting environmentally-conscious lifestyles, more sustainable lifestyles, based on 3Ps of “Pro Planet People” to tackle climate change"
15273,India has made a strong pitch for protecting the interests of developing and under-developed countries at the WTO.
15274,The current proposals for WTO Reform could fundamentally change its institutional architecture and undermine the system against the interests of developing countries.
15275,"The developing world aspires to work for a better future, but it is not possible to do so if it does not take the same obligations as the developed nations."
15276,The COVID Pandemic has exposed the inability of the world to respond to any crisis effectively.
15277,WTO failed the world. Vaccine inequity persists even two years after COVID. Some countries have already administered the 3rd or 4th dose.
15278,"To rebuild trust and credibility, Shri Goyal said, we must first addressmandated issues, like the Permanent Solution toPublic Stockholding agreed nearly a decade ago."
15279,"“The current global food crisis is a reminder to us thatwe act now! Can we risk the lives of millions of peopledependent on food stocks maintained for the poor andvulnerable?,” Shri Goyal asked."
15280,India alonedistributed 100 million tonnes of foodgrain free ofcharge to 800 million Indians during the pandemic at a cost of nearly US$50 billion.
15281,"Shri Goyal argued that while negotiating the Fisheries Subsidies, the livelihood of traditional fishermen cannot be compromise."
15282,"“We cannot institutionalize the privileges of a few countries and take away the right to progress for those who are working for the vulnerable or marginalized sections of society. Otherwise, we may have a similar situation like the Agreement onAgriculture, where inequities and asymmetries persist and several countries still depend on food aid."
15283,"On climate issues, Shri Goyal proposed we need to adoptenvironmentally-conscious lifestyles, more sustainablelifestyles, based on 3Ps of “Pro Planet People”."
15284,The WTO needs to rebuild trust.
15285,Thematic Session Statement of Shri Piyush Goyal during the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO on 'WTO Response to the Pandemic'
15286,"Following is the full text of the Thematic Session Statement made by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal during the 12thMinisterial Conference of the WTO in Geneva today on 'WTO Response to the Pandemic':"
15287,"“Madam Director General, His Excellency Dr. Margaret Tew, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, Barbados, Ambassador Dacio Castillo, the Facilitator of the WTO Response to the Pandemic, Ambassador Dr. Lansana Gberie, Chair of the TRIPS Council, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen."
15288,Director General Ngozi's birthday is celebrated today.
15289,Friends from around the world wish me all the best.
15290,WTO’s Response to Pandemic text has struck a fine and carefully crafted balance.
15291,The response document is the only clean negotiated document to be submitted to the MC and is a testament to the good process that it has come through.
15292,India has made many compromises to make MC-12 possible.
15293,"Therefore, disturbing this delicately poised document even slightly would unravel the months-long complex negotiations and will run the risk of failing an outcome we are close to achieving."
15294,The negotiations on therapeutics and diagnostics should be concluded together with the resolution of the TRIPS document.
15295,Friends have some concerns about the draft declaration of 10 June 2022.
15296,There were huge concerns about food security during the COVID 19 pandemic. India distributed nearly 100 million tonnes of food grains through the public distribution system. This was done at a cost of over 50 billion US dollars.
15297,South Africa and India's request for a TRIPS waiver for their response to the COVID 19 pandemic was unsuccessful.
15298,The draft text from the Waiver negotiations was not acceptable to the general membership. South Africa and India are disappointed with the text.
15299,The pandemic is far from over. We need to ramp up manufacture of therapeutics and diagnostics to achieve a comprehensive test and treat strategy.
15300,"It has taken us a long time to reach this stage. Vaccines are no more in scarcity with sufficient and affordable stocks available across the world. However, there is opposition to some of the clauses even now. "
15301,Text of Speech delivered by Shri Piyush Goyal on “Challenges confronting the Multilateral Trading System” during the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Geneva
15302,"Following is the text of the speech delivered by the Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal on “Challenges confronting the Multilateral Trading System” during the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Geneva yesterday:"
15303,"“The COVID Pandemic has exposed the inability of the world to promptly respond to any crisis, whether on food security or health, economic well being or open supply chains. As an example, vaccine inequity persists even two years after COVID. "
15304,"The current global food crisis is a reminder to act now. To rebuild trust and credibility, we must first address mandated issues."
15305,"While negotiating the Fisheries Subsidies, the livelihood of traditional fishermen cannot be compromised. "
15306,"The current proposals for WTO Reform could fundamentally change its institutional architecture, skewing the system against developing countries. "
15307,"On climate issues, we need to adopt environmentally-conscious lifestyles."
15308,"Friends, those who question the need for S&DT provisions are aware that the per capita GDP of developed countries is 20 to 50 times that of developing countries. Even India is at the lower end of this range. "
15309,The WTO needs to rebuild trust.
15310,Intervention by Shri Piyush Goyal at the Plenary Session of 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO
15311,"Following is the full text of the Intervention made by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles, Shri Piyush Goyal during the Plenary Session of 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Geneva today:"
15312,"“Mr. Chairperson, Mr. Co-chair, Madam Director General, Ministers, Ambassadors, Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, warm greetings to all."
15313,"On behalf of the Indian delegation, I thank the co-hosts of the MC12 for their efforts in organizing this much delayed Conference."
15314,"I carry the aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians who, despite global challenges, are actively participating as trusted partners in making this planet a better place."
15315,Rising food prices pose a serious humanitarian crisis.
15316,The World Trade Organization (WTO) should focus on the issue of public foodstocks as the top priority for MC12.
15317,Rich countries let down the poor people of developing countries by not responding to the pandemic in time.
15318,"Mr. Chairman, living in harmony with Nature is enshrined in Indian culture. Traditional fishing communities in India worship nature and use sustainable methods of fishing."
15319,"Fishing by my country’s traditional fishermen and women is an important SDG goal. For food security and eradication of hunger, sustainable fishing is as important as agriculture."
15320,"WTO reform is necessary keeping development at its core, to be decided through a precise, transparent and inclusive process, upholding the basic principles and objectives of the WTO, particularly consensus-based decision making and S&DT."
15321,"The World Trade Organization (WTO) should not negotiate rules on non-trade-related subjects like climate change, gender, etc. which legitimately fall within the domain of other inter-governmental organisations."
15322,India supports the campaign for environment-conscious lifestyle.
15323,"In conclusion, let me say that when the world is facing severe challenges and expects the WTO to deliver solutions, the MC12 must send a strong message that the rich care for the poor, vulnerable and marginalized people and that we have come together to give them a better future."
15324,The WTO should embrace a people first approach to trade.”
15325,Intervention by Commerce & Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal at the G-33 Ministerial Meeting at the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference held in Geneva
15326,Indonesia organises the G-33 meeting at the very start of the MC-12. The main agenda items are a solution to public stockholding and a special safeguard mechanism.
15327,"At the outset, I would like to say that it would have been better if the Director General was also present to hear the concerns of the developing world and I feel it is unfortunate that in her brief comments she referred to a decision that has been made not once, not twice but thrice, as a mere iteration and I would urge the Chair to convey if it is agreed by all my friends here, that it was not a declaration but a decision that was made in 2013, again in 2015 and then again in 2018 that we are sitting down here to discuss."
15328,India has had an experience to transit from a food deficit nation to a largely self sufficient food nation thanks to state support. India is fighting for all the developing countries including the LDCs collectively based on its own journey.
15329,"After 8 years of negotiations, the Marrakesh agreement led to the establishment of the WTO. Agriculture got a raw deal- imbalanced outcomes and those who were distorting markets were able to continue to grant export subsidies."
15330,Developing countries including the LDCs are always at the receiving end when it comes to negotiations.
15331,The declaration of the work program was an important part of the conference. The Ministerial Conference 13 is going to rewrite the script.
15332,"On 28th November 2014, the General Council has reiterated the decision of 27th of November 2014 on public stockholding for food security purposes.

15347,"Higher remuneration to farmers did not result in higher wheat prices for consumers due to administrative measures and more availability of wheat for domestic supply chain, said Shri Angamuthu."

17191,"Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Rebuts the Environmental Performance index 2022 released recently"
17192,“Index has many indicators based on unfounded assumptions”“Some of these indicators used for assessing performance are extrapolated and based on surmises and unscientific methods”
17193,The environmental performance index 2022 has many indicators based on unfounded assumptions.
17194, The Ministry of Environment does not accept its analysis and conclusions for the following reasons: -
17195,A new indicator in the Climate Policy objective is Projected GHG Emissions levels in 2050.
17196,Both forests and wetlands of the country are crucial carbon sinks which have not been factored in while computing the projected GHG emissions trajectory upto 2050 given by EPI 2022.
17197,Historical data on the lowest emission trajectory has been ignored in the above computation.
17198,The weight of indictors in which the country was performing well has been reduced and reasons for change in assignment of weights has not been explained in the report.
17199,The principle of equity is given very low weightage in the index.
17200,India has already achieved the target of 40% of installed electricity capacity from non- fossil fuel based sources.
17201,The Copernicus air pollutant concentration data based on which DALYs are derived have higher uncertainty in regions with less extensive monitoring networks and emissions inventories.
17202,"The indicators on Water quality, Water use efficiency, Waste Generation per capita which are closely linked to Sustainable Consumption and Production are not included in the Index."
17203,The Index focuses on the extent of Protected Areas rather than the quality of protection they offer. Management Effectiveness Evaluation of the Protected areas and eco-sensitive regions is not factored into the computation of Biodiversity Indices.
17204,The index computes extent of ecosystems but does not capture their condition or productivity.
17205,"Indicators like Agro biodiversity, soil health, food loss and waste are not included even though they are important for developing countries with large agrarian populations."
17206,The detailed analysis of the flaws is given below: 
17207,India is assigned a rank of 165 in the policy objective as compared to 106 earlier.
17208,"For a newly added Indicator “Projected Emissions levels in 2050” which is 36% of the issue category Climate Change, the methodology used is- “The average rate of increase or decrease in emissions over ten years (2010-2019) is calculated and extrapolated to 2050, projecting the level of emissions in that same year”. India being a developing country and second largest in population will have increasing trend of GHG emissions."
17209,The EPI 2022 report shows that India has one of the lowest emission trajectories vis a vis Other Countries as well as the Rest of the World.
17210,The weight of indicators in which India has scored well has been reduced.
17211,"The Report admits that industrializing countries have a right to sustainably develop, expand their economies and improve their populations’ quality of life. However, it also admits that there may be initial increases in greenhouse gas emissions from least-developed countries."
17212,The UNFCCC Equity Principle on Common but differentiated responsibilities as per national circumstances and usage of renewable energy is not reflected in the Climate Change indicators.
17213,The 2022 EPI’s adjusted emissions growth rate indicators are derived from existing GHG inventories that in turn are calculated using several assumptions.
17214,The indicators are limited to the renewable energy and energy efficiency.
17215,Per capita GHG emissions contribute only a miniscule 2.6% weight overall in the Index.
17216,India is party to Paris Agreement and has given a goal of NET ZERO by 2070 and hence comparing it to countries with Projected 2050 emissions level in 2050 equal to or below zero receiving the maximum score is against the principle of Equity as enshrined in CBDR-RC.
17217,"The EPI’s pilot indicator does not yet account for carbon dioxide removal. The EPI team expects carbon capture and sequestration efforts to become an increasingly important feature of national climate policy portfolios in the years to come. As research and datasets on carbon sequestration advance, the EPI will incorporate negative emissions estimates into its future projections."
17218,India's carbon sink is not reflected in its emissions trajectory.
17219,"The estimated greenhouse gas emissions from India are estimated by multiplying activity by a corresponding emissions factors. The report admits that these factors do not account for variation across sites, factories, and operations. For instance, agricultural emissions factors are too granular to be comprehensively represented in current national emissions inventories. In many cases, the default emission factors are not specific to the country."
17220,II. For Environmental Health indicators-
17221,The Copernicus air pollutant concentration data have higher uncertainty in regions with less extensive monitoring networks and emissions inventories.
17222,The water quality index is not accurate. India has standards for water quality and monitoring stations. India also submits data on Good Ambient Water Quality for Sustainable Development Goals.
17223,The Ecosystem Vitality Policy Objective has been reduced from 60% to 42% in the total EPI.
17224,"EPI in its 2022 Report acknowledges that the indicators - Terrestrial Biome Protection, National (TBN) and Global (TBG) - are incomplete proxies for realized biome protection. "
17225,"Indicators such as TBN, TBG or the Protected Area Representativeness Index (PARI) rely on aerial coverage of protected areas."
17226,"The EPI 2022 Report points out that the use of data intensive indicators like Species Habitat Index (SHI), Species Protection Index (SPI) and Biodiversity Habitat index (BHI) is not effective in capturing the performance of a country towards biodiversity and habitat protection."
17227,"For the Marine Protected Areas indicator, it may be noted the entire EEZ is taken as the denominator for computing this metric, which is not suitable for India as it has all its coastal and MPAs within the Territorial Sea and taking a vast area of EEZ as the denominator is not acceptable."
17228,The Publishing Agency will not extend support to help India understand and replicate the methodology used by Yale University.
17229,The method of calculating the indicator based on the outdated data is invalid.
17230,"According to the JRC 2020 Report, the Terrestrial Biome Protection - National (TBN) and Terrestrial biome Protection – Global (TBG) should not be included in the 2022 Report."
17231,"Further, as pointed in the JRC 2020 Report, the indicators which have no significant correlation with the respective issue category or with the EPI per se, have also been retained such as the Biodiversity Habitat Index (BHV) and the Species Habitat Index (SHI) that could have been replaced with more appropriate indicators."
17232,The issue category for ecosystem services needs to be expanded to include metrics that truly capture the services provided by various ecosystems.
17233,"The JRC 2020 Report has suggested that a higher weightage must be given to Grassland loss and Wetland loss in EPI 2022. However, the improvement under these parameters is not reflected in the Climate change issue category."
17234,India has only two indicators under the Agriculture category.
17235,The JRC report of 2020 states that the Fish Stock Status (FSS) and Fish caught by Trawling (FGT) are negatively correlated with the policy objective of Ecosystem Vitality.
