1522,"Demonitisation has Helped Share of Financial Saving Rise, Says Economic Survey "
1523,The highlights of the Investment and Savings situation as brought out by Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled in Parliament today are as follows:-
1524,India’s unprecedented climb to historic high levels of investment and saving rates in the mid-2000s has been followed by a gradual decline.
1525,"• The ratio of domestic saving to GDP reached 29.2 per cent in 2013 to a peak of 38.3 per cent in 2007, before falling back to 29 per cent in 2016."
1526,"• The cumulative fall over 2007 and 2016 has been milder for investment than saving, but investment has fallen to a lower level."
1527,"Based on the break-up of investment and saving, that is available up to 2015-16, private investment accounts for 5 percentage points out of the 6.3 percentage point overall investment decline over 2007-08 and 2015-16."
1528,"Asian countries faced the largest number of economic slowdown episodes following 1997. In India, the investment slowdown started in 2012 and has intensified."
1529,"Since investment slows down, policy priorities over the short run have focused on reviving investment by mobilizing saving, via attempts to unearth black money and encouraging the conversion of gold into financial saving."
1530,The policy conclusion of the cross-country experience to study the pattern of investment and saving slowdowns is urgent prioritizing of investment revival to arrest more lasting growth impacts.
1531,Economic Survey calls for Fiscal Federalism and accountability to avoid low equilibrium trap 
1532,"Is there a low equilibrium trap if fiscal federalism is not achieved? This was the question posed by the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley in Parliament today."
1533,The Survey has highlighted the challenges of fiscal federalism and accountability in rural areas. Panchayats received 95% of their revenues from the Centre and State while generating only 5% from own resources. Pachayats in States collect some direct taxes but most of them rely on transfer funds.
1534,The Survey highlighted that economic and political development is associated with a rising share of direct taxes in total taxes. Direct taxes account for 70 per cent of total taxes in Europe while in India they remain around 35%. Direct taxes in India are declining. 
1535,Rural local governments in India generate less than half of their revenue from direct taxes as compared to urban local governments.
1536,The local governments in India in tier 2 and tier 3 rely less on devolved resources and collect less direct taxes.
1537,The Survey asks whether there is an unwillingness to tax by the state or whether the problem is related to the proximity between the state and the citizens.
1538,India Not Yet Facing “Late Converger Stall” 
1539,Needs to Focus on Rapid Improvement of Human Capital and Agricultural Productivity to Sustain Growth Trajectory 
1540,Arun Jaitley tabled the Economic Survey 2017-18 in Parliament today. 
1541,"The present era is one of economic convergence whereby poorer countries including India have grown faster than richer countries. However, there are fears that the process of convergence may slow down for countries like India, who are trying to make a transition after the global financial crisis. India moved from being a low income country in 1960 to a lower middle income nation in 2008. It needs to address four challenges to ward off the fears of an impending ""Late Converger Stall""."
1542,a. Hyper globalization repudiation or backlash against globalization
1543,"Early convergers like Japan, South Korea and China were able to post average export growth rates of over 15% for thirty years. However, the trading environment for late convergers such as India has changed. A backlash in advanced countries against rapid globalization has led to a fall in world trade GDP ratios since 2011."
1544,Structural transformation requires a shift of resources from low productivity to high productivity sectors.
1545,c. Upgrading human capital to the demands of a technology-intensive workplace
1546,The education system in late convergers like India is failing to provide basic learning standards.
1547,d. climate change-induced agricultural stress
1548,"Growth rates of agricultural productivity for richer countries have been consistently greater than for developing countries. For India, the rate of growth in productivity has been stagnant for the last 30 years."
1549,The Indian Survey says that growth in India has occurred with limited transfer of labour resources from low productivity to high productivity and dynamic sectors. Rapidly improving human capital will be key to sustaining India’s dynamic growth trajectory. 
1550,Economic Survey Notes Important Developments on Trade Policy Front 
1551,There were important developments on the trade policy front during the year. The mid-term review of Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) and the recent multilateral negotiations of WTO were held. There were also developments on trade logistics and anti dumping measures.
1552,FTP-Mid Term Review and subsequent trade related policies.
1553,"In the mid-term review of FTP released on 5th December 2017, additional measures have been taken to help India’s trade sector. On 15th December, 2017, a special package for employment generation in the leather and footwear sector was approved by the Government."
1554,The Eleventh Ministerial Conference (MCII) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ended without aMinisterial Declaration or any substantive outcome.
1555,"During MCII India stood firm on its stand on the fundamental principles of the WTO, including multilateralism, rule-based consensual decision making, an independent and credible dispute resolution and appellate process, the centrality of development which underlies theDoha Development Agenda (DDAQ) and special and differential treatment for all developing countries."
1556,"India's foreign exchange reserves reached a record high of US$ 413.8 billion on January 12, 2018."
1557,The import cover of India's foreign exchange reserves has increased.

1559,The Economic Survey of India 2017-18 was tabled in Parliament today.

1561,"Broadly, the publication trends reveal that India is gradually improving its performance as measured by the number of publications which is an important metric."
1562,"In addition to increasing publications, trends in quality are also slowly improving. The Nature Index ranked India at 13 in 2017."
1563,"According to the WIPO, India has the world's 7th largest Patent Filing Office with 45,658 patents filed in 2015."
1564,"Patent applications and grants in India have grown rapidly in foreign jurisdictions, but the situation is different at home."

1566,India’s External Sector Continues to be Strong Says the Economic Survey
1567,"India’s external sector continued to be resilient and strong in 2017-18, as observed in the Economic Survey 2017-18 which was tabled in Parliament today by the Union Finance & Corporate Affairs, ShriArunJaitley."
1568,The global economy is gathering pace and is expectedto accelerate from 3.2 percent in 2016 to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7 percent in 2018 which reflects an upward revision of the earlier projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
1569,India's balance of payments situation has been good since 2013-14. The current account deficit narrowed sharply in the second quarter of 2017-18.
1570,India's trade deficit (on custom basis) widened to US$ 74.5 billion in 2017-18 from US$ 43.4 billion in 2016-17. India's trade deficits (on POL and non-POL basis) grew by more than 50% in the last two years.
1571,"The export growth in 2016-17 was broad based with positive growth in major categories except textiles & allied products and leather and leather manufactures. In 2017-18 (April-November), export growth is moderate with growth in engineering goods and petroleum crude and products, moderate growth in chemicals and related products, and textiles and allied products, but negative growth in gems and jewellery."
1572,"The prospects for India's External Sector in this and coming year look bright with world trade growing at 4.2 and 4.4% in 2017 and 2018. The downside risks lie in the rise in oil prices. However, higher inflow of remittances and policies of the government could help."
1573,"India Needs to be a net producer of Knowledge, says the Economic Survey "
1574,"As India emerges as one of the world’s largest economics, it needs to gradually move from being a net consumer of knowledge to becoming a net producer."
1575,"This has been emphasized in the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled in the Parliament today, by the Union Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley."
1576,"India needs to invest more in scientific research and knowledge to attract more young people to scientific enterprise. Investing in science is also fundamental to India’s security, the human security and the resilience to threats."
1577,FM: Dynamic nature of the Indian economy and availability of technology tools has impacted the functioning of all the Departments including the nature of Tax Administration. Two major challenges before the Customs Administration today are trade facilitation and sharp detection & enforcement.

1998,"""India is the largest democracy in the world, but despite strengthening various institutions for the last seven decades it has not been able to evolve a transparent political funding system. Political parties spend a lot of money on election campaigns, publicity, tours, travels and election related establishments."
1999,The political parties are trying to change the current system of funding for the political system.
2000,Income Tax Act was amended to include a provision that donations made to political parties would be treated as expenditure and the donor would not have to pay any tax. It was hoped that donors would increasingly start donating money by cheque.
2001,"In the Budget Speech for the year 2017-18, I had announced that donations to political parties would be substantially widened and donations of clean money could be made in several ways. A donor could enjoy a tax deduction by donating in cheque or online. A cash donation to a political party could not exceed Rs. 2000/-. "
2002,"Donations made online or through cheques remain an ideal method of donating to political parties. However, the electoral bond scheme, which I placed before the Parliament, envisages total clean money and substantial transparency coming into the system of political funding."
2003,The government will consider all suggestions to strengthen the cleansing of political funding in India.

2111,"Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017 seeks to protect and enhance the depositors’ existing rights and bring in a comprehensive and efficient resolution regime for financial firms."
2112,"Rationale forthe Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017"
2113,"There is no comprehensive and integrated legal framework for resolution, including liquidation, of financial firms in India presently."
2114,"Regulators, Government and the Courts have multiple roles and responsibilities for resolution of financial services providers."
2115,The resolution instruments available under the respective legislations are limited and there is no guidance on the process leading up to the resolution. The Reserve Bank of India has limited resolution powers.
2116,The current resolution regime for financial companies in India is inadequate and inappropriate for private sector financial firms.
2117,"The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017 (FRDI Bill) will replace the existing resolution regime by providing a comprehensive resolution regime that will help ensure that, in the rare event of failure of a financial service provider, there is a system of quick, orderly and efficient resolution in favour of depositors."
2118,The failure of a financial service provider could have a wider impact on the economy and financial stability of a country than traditional insolvency. Financial service providers handle consumer funds and are critical for financial stability. They need to be resolved expeditiously.
2119,The FRDI Bill proposes to establish a Resolution Corporation and a comprehensive resolution regime to enable timely and orderly resolution of a failing financial firm.
2120,"It provides for detecting incipient insolvencies in financial firms by introducing a five-stage health classification of financial firms and stepping in to appropriately nurse a financial firm at the stage when its health becomes weak and it is classified in the category of material risk to viability, much before it is it is classified in the category of critical risk to viability when there might be no option but to resolve or liquidate the financial firm."
2121,"FRDI Bill also introduces a menu of resolution tools, including transfer of whole or parts of the assets and liabilities of a financial firm to another person, acquisition, merger or amalgamation, bridge service provider, and bail-in, and mandates recovery and resolution planning obligations to enable careful monitoring of risk to viability of a financial firm."
2122,"The FRDI Bill also transfers the deposit insurance functions from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation to the Resolution Corporation, targeting at an integrated approach to the depositor protection and resolution."
2123,Protection and enhancement of depositors’ rights under the FRDI Bill
2124,The FRDI Bill provides additional protections to the depositors in a more transparent manner.
2125,Debit insurance for up to Rs. 1.5 Lakh is being extended under FRDI Bill.
2126,"The uninsured depositors, that is, beyond Rs. 1.5 Lakh, will be better protected under the FRDI Bill."
2127,"Thus, the interests of depositors (both insured and uninsured) would be better protected under the FRDI Bill."
2128,Indian Banks have adequate capital and are under prudent regulation and supervision to ensure safety and soundness of the banking system.
2129,There are some misgivings expressed in the media about the depositor protection provisions of the FRDI Bill.
2130,"Following formal safeguards have been built in the FRDI Bill pertaining to the appropriate use of bail-in, whereas the rights or interests of depositors can be, inter-alia, reduced in case of forced merger of a banking company with another bank under the present law without these explicit safeguards."
2131,Insured deposits of banks can not be used in case of bail-in.
2132,"The Resolution Corporation will have the option to design an appropriate bail-in instrument, which will be subject to Government scrutiny and oversight of the Parliament."
2133,"Cancellation of liability of the depositor beyond insured amount will be possible only with the prior consent of the client.

5208,India's judiciary is overburdened by the sheer volume of cases. There is a backlog of 3.3 crore cases in various courts of the country.
5209,There is a culture in the judiciary of seeking adjournments as a norm rather than an exception. I have been told that the judiciary is making sincere efforts to curb this practice.

5216,The Bar Council of India trains advocates.
5217,The second stage of reforms came in the mid-1980s and involved the setting up of deemed universities where a wide range of subjects is taught to prospective lawyers.

5219,The traditional law faculties in public universities provide the backbone of the legal fraternity in India. They should be given greater autonomy.

5247,"Your initiative will require regular development of content, using multimedia technology. It will require expert content writers, graphic designers, animators etc."
5248,"I will also suggest that, education and skill development should be part of all education programmes."

5331,Following is the text of Vice President’s address:
5332,"“I am pleased to be among the bright students of this prestigious institution, the Jaipur Homeopathy University, to share their joy and hope, at this crucial juncture of their professional career."

5334,Today is a special occasion for the students of the university. They have a special responsibility towards society.
5335,"The University of Homoeopathy has established itself as center of excellence in Homoeopathic education and research. Apart from Bachelor’s degree in homoeopathy, you have MD and Ph.D. degree programmes, MSc Biotechnology, Bio-Chemistry, Pharmacy and Nursing courses, apart from Certificate course in homoopathy for Allopathy doctors."
5336,"There is less than 1 doctor per 1000 population in semi-urban and rural areas. In such a scenario, alternative system of medicine, AYUSH, can bridge the gap."
5337,Today I am meeting young healthcare professionals on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji.
5338,The scheme seeking to provide insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family will cover 10 crore marginalized and vulnerable families for secondary and tertiary healthcare.
5339,"As you all are aware, technology-driven modern healthcare is becoming increasingly expensive."
5340,"The public sector spends 30% of total health expenditure on India, while the remaining 70% is spent through private sector. Out-of-pocket spending on health in India is 95% directly by individuals at points of health services and 5% by insurance."
5341,"As regards out-of-pocket expenditure, 52 per cent goes towards medicines, 22 per cent towards hospitalization at a private hospital and 10 per cent for diagnostic labs."
5342,Unaffordable healthcare is a serious social handicap and Ayushman Bharat scheme would be a real boon for the poor and needy sections of the society.
5343,People are looking for affordable healthcare alternatives. Homeopathy is an effective and effective method of medicine in remote locations.
5344,The Government has introduced homoeopathy treatment in its primary and secondary health centers. Homoeopathy is available in 30% of the AYUSH dispensaries.
5345,There are 2.8 lakh homoeopathy doctors in the country. They treat common illnesses and diseases.
5346,The need of the hour is to put in place standardized practices and processes for all systems of medicine and I glad that the National Health Policy proposes to mainstream Homoeopathy and other Indian systems of medicine by standardizing the processes and practices.
5347,"In order to standardize and maintain the quality of homoeopathy education and research, the Parliament has recently passed the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill to regulate education institutions and weed out unscrupulous elements that seek to exploit the growing opportunity in this sector."
5348,The Bill makes Central Government’s approval necessary for establishing a new institution or for starting a new course.
5349,The quality control of homeopathy medicines needs to be improved.
5350,The safety of homeopathy medicines depends on their quality.
5351,The Central Scheme of Pharmacovigilance for AYUSH medicines is being framed by the Government to monitor the quality control at every level. It is necessary to have at least one testing and drug manufacturing facility in every State under this scheme.
5352,"In the absence of quality control and standardization of medicine, the upcoming sector of affordable healthcare may lose public faith."
5353,Homoeopathy as a healthcare system has been recognised in 80 countries today. Homeopaths should continue to advance their discipline with new discoveries and innovative research.
5354,I am happy to note that the Homoeopathy University conducts Ph.D programme and also publishes the Journal to share the research work with larger medical community.

5368,"“I am pleased to join you at this important conference that brings global smart city experts, technological solution providers, town planners and administrators to discuss various aspects of techno-administrative interventions to make our cities smart."
5369,"Ever since the economic reform, India has witnessed rapid urbanization. Today, 30% of the population lives in towns and cities."
5370,Cities and towns have become hubs of business and construction activities drawing waves of migrant populations from the hinterland. This constant influx of people has put pressure on civic infrastructure and urban facilities.
5371,"With this objective, the Government of India had launched the Smart City Mission in June 2015 when I was the Urban Development Minister."
5372,The Government launched a major housing development programme aimed at providing a house to every family by 2022.
5373,"I am aware that progress has been made in each of the Smart City Programme. However, more work needs to be done. A comprehensive Livability Index for our cities is in the process of being prepared."
5374,Cities covered under Smart city programme will rank highly on the Livability Index.
5375,"Following selection of 100 Cities from different States on the basis of competitive bidding, every city is being provided Rs 100 crores every year by the Government of India for five years, while the States are coming up with matching contribution."
5376,The selected 100 cities will require an investment of more than Rs 2.5 Lakh Crores.
5377,"The government's infrastructure development programme is in its acceleration phase. Projects amounting to Rs. 6,500 crores have been completed and others initiated."
5378,The trend of making cities smart and sustainable is catching fast. The Conference will give you the opportunity to share your experiences and find solutions to remove bottlenecks.
5379,"The Pink City of Jaipur, established by Maharaj Man Singh in the 18th century, has been a Smart city of its time."

5384,I would like the experts gathered here to look critically at the issue of city mobility and urban planning. Our cities have become energy guzzlers with people preferring fuel-inefficient private vehicles over public transport.
5385,"I am glad to know that under Smart city scheme, pedestrian non-motorised mobility is being promoted in Jaipur. The target is to achieve 45 per cent mobility through mass public transport by 2025."
5386,"As the demand for energy increases with rising urbanization, you need to explore eco-friendly and renewable sources of energy.

5390,"As we seek to make our cities smart with technology interventions, it will also impinge upon the social development of the city. Since a city is essentially made up of its citizens, social development should be at the core of every project undertaken by Smart Cities. Smart Cities should focus on the vulnerabilities of the poor, migrants, and women."
5391,"In Smart cities, technology should not only act as leveler, but must be used extensively to monitor and track societal crimes against women and other vulnerable sections."
5392,"The top priority should be to provide road, electric and digital connectivity to villages."
5393,"Heritage city like Jaipur can be improved with technological intervention. Smart signage, simultaneous multi-lingual interpretation services, tourist friendly affordable mobility and accommodation, virtual presentation of places of tourist attraction and tourist help services are some of the measures that could improve the experience of Jaipuri people."
5394,I am attending the Conference.

I am very happy that all the participants travelled from different parts of the world from Suriname to Fiji, Mauritius to Thailand to commemorate the 125th anniversary of Swami Vivekananda's address."
5896,It was a unique event in modern world history that is worth commemorating.
5897,"Organized as a part of the celebration of the voyages of Christopher Columbus around the world, the World’s Parliament of Religions emerged as a celebration of the rich diversity in religious and cultural beliefs around the world."
5898,Swami Vivekananda's address at the Parliament of Religions was influential.
5899,The conference that took place 125 years ago still resonates and strikes a deep resonance in people across the globe.
5900,"It is said of the great Indian epic Ramayana that as long as mountains and rivers remain on this earth and the rivers flow, the story of Ramana will continue to be popular."
5901,"Whenever the world is faced with the threats of fragmentation, conflict, hatred and irrational prejudices, the Indian voice brings to the world the soothing, inclusive perspectives that have pervaded its cultural world for more than two millennia."
5902,"As Swami Vivekananda said in his inaugural speech at Chicago on September 11, 1893, ours is a country that has “taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance.” India believes “not only in universal toleration but we accept all religions as true.”"
5903,"Sisters and brothers from around the world,"
5904,"As the three-day conference ends, I would like to suggest some important aspects of our shared cultural heritage that were articulated by Swami Vivekananda in his Chicago addresses."
5905,The World Hindu Congress is taking place. Dr. Radhakrishan explains what Hinduism is and what it stands for.
5906,The question is: what are the essential elements or facets of this “way of life”? Let me outline a few important ones.
5907,The following verse from the Hitopadesha confirms the Hindus' view that the whole world is a family.
5908,"“Ayam nijah paroveti ganana Laghuchetasam, Udaara Purushaanam tu vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (To consider some of our fellow beings as our own and others as not our own reflects a poor understanding. The enlightened people see the entire world as one family)."
5909,The whole world including all the animate and inanimate objects are composed of the same elements and have the same divine energy.
5910,The first name of Lord Vishnu in Vishnu Sahasranamam is Viswam (The world). Hindus believe that God lives in each living and non-living entity in this world.
5911,"As the Ishavasya Upanishad says, the divine principle pervades every atom in this universe."
5912,"When we see the world in this light, we cannot have a world which is fragmented or broken into “narrow domestic walls” as Gurudev Rabindranath had said."
5913,"In our world view, everyone is created equal and should be respected and treated as equal."
5914,This world view makes us care for our fellow beings and their needs. It will create a more sustainable planet.
5915,The third aspect is tolerance and acceptance of plurality.
5916,The third aspect of Hinduism is the acceptance of all religious beliefs.
5917,The fifth important aspect of Hinduism is the ability to absorb and adapt.
5918,I have pointed out some salient aspects of Hindu world view that Swami Vivekananda had brilliantly elaborated in his Chicago addresses and in his lectures in India and abroad.
5919,Swami Vivekananda had focused on the spiritual strength of India and its treatment of women.
5920,"I think Hinduism’s unequivocal messages of tolerance, acceptance, unity and plurality of love, compassion, service, charity, gender equality, poverty alleviation and protection of the environment that exponents like Swami Vivekananda had spread across the world embody timeless values that are more relevant today than ever before."
5921,"We should ensure that these values are further reinforced through behavior and action, as Swamiji said, by ‘being’ and ‘becoming’."
5922,The organizers of this conference have chosen a good motto “Sumantrite suvikrante” that could provide a good way forward.
5923,This is taken from the Chapter 3 of Mahabharata in which Yudhishthira tells Bheema
5924,“Sumantrite suvikrante sukrute suvicharite
5925,Siddhyantyarthaah mahabaho daivam chatra pradakshinam”
5926,(Whatever task is carried out after consultation and careful consideration will achieve the desired outcomes. Gods will be pleased with this kind of work).
5927,"Hinduism provides a practical and seamless continuum between the inner spiritual world and the outer materialistic world, thus, bringing great harmony between our day-to-day existence and the existential questions we face as modern societies."
5928,"The world has embarked on an ambitious and transformative agenda focused on ‘people’, ‘prosperity’ and ‘planet’. "
5929,India is also moving on an ambitious reform agenda that seeks to transform people’s lives.
5930,"At this juncture, the values we all cherish, as Indians, can be the guideposts for our individual growth and collective advancement."
5931,"Let me recall what Max Muller, the great Indologist had said."
5932,"India has inherited a treasure house of ideas, values and attitudes."
5933,"In a world that is filled with bitterness, India could provide the honey of wisdom gathered from different flowers by different bees."
5934,"As Swami Vivekananda had said about India: “Her influence has fallen upon the world like that of the gentle dew, unheard and scarcely marked, yet bringing into bloom the fairest flowers of the earth”."
5935,I hope the delegates from this conference will take inspiration from Swami Vivekananda’s speeches.
5936,"Let me conclude, as all Upanishads start and end, with a shanti mantra, a prayer for peace."
5937,Om Bhadram Karnebhih Shrunuyaama Devaah |
5938,Bhadram Pashyema-Akshabhir-Yajatraah |
5939,"(May we hear good news, may we see good things, may we work together with devotion, steady mind and strong bodies and spend our lives in pursuit of goodness)"

6068,An administrator will feel grossly handicapped without a better understanding of the legal framework. A legal researcher will be hamstrung if his knowledge is not updated on a day to day basis.
6069,"Law education during the British days was aimed at creating lawyers who could help the administration of justice. Nowadays, lawyers have to play a variety of new crimes triggered by the technological advancements and liberalization. New types of cases like anti-dumping, intellectual property violations relating to patents, trademark etc need a holistic knowledge of economics."

6073,The legal fraternity should consider giving legal aid to the poor.
6074,The introduction of five year integrated courses in legal education has not provided the necessary knowledge. Law graduates should have a good grasp of international laws and be able to weigh the pros and cons.
6075,"In the second part of my address, I want to highlight the need to promote the profession of law education in India."
6076,An area that has received scant attention in India is the Law of Torts. Law of torts protects people who become victims of negligence by another party. All of us are aware of how pharmaceutical and tobacco companies have to part with huge damages if negligence is proved in the court of law.

6101,Amul was ready almost a year before independence.
6102,Sardar Saheb Patel won the election from Dariyapur by one vote and later became the Chairman of Ahmedabad Municipality.

6115,Amul will complete 75 years after a couple of years. India will celebrate 75 years of independence in the year 2022.
6116,Today I have come here to ask Amul to set new targets for the organization.
6117,Amul wants to increase its ranking in milk processing to the third place by 75 years of independence.
6118,There was a time when the country was facing the problem of scarcity. Today the country is not facing that problem. The country is experiencing an abundance.
6119,"There was a time when production was low and we had to import wheat even for consumption. Now some of the things we produce are surplus. The processing or value addition of surplus produce is one of the solutions. If the dairy industry had not been expanded and new processed products of milk were not made, farmers would have left animal husbandry."
6120,"When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had attended the Krishi Mahotsav in Anand. I met one of my old friends. He was wearing a coat, trousers and a tie then. Value addition in agricultural products is important for us."
6121,Amreli and Banas Dairies in India are making a contribution towards honey production.
6122,"In his speech, he proposes a new initiative for mid-day meals for school children."

6124,There is a conflict over pasture land. The brothers of Dharmaj used to provide home delivery of green grass on a daily basis. They started to develop the pastures and earn income from it.
6125,The thoughts of the people form the essence and values of the cooperatives.
6126,The Central Government will continue to support the projects of the Amul family and the farmers of Charottar.

Today we may feel that even by making a tiny contribution I may be contributing in a big way to the economic upliftment and economic empowerment of my country and help fight a battle against poverty by lending strength to the poor. For example, think of purchasing Khadi and handloom products on special occasions."

6660,"Incidentally, 125 years ago, when Swami Vivekanandji spoke at the World Congress of Religions in Chicago, there were about four thousand people in the audience."
6661,"I do not know if there is any other example of celebrating the anniversary of a great, inspiring address."
6662,"This celebration, therefore, shows the impact of Swami ji's address - how it changed the way the west saw India and how Indian thought and philosophy found its rightful place."
6663,The event you have organised makes the anniversary of the Chicago address even more special.
6664,"Congrats to everybody associated with the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, the Government of Tamil Nadu, thousands of my young friends assembled here today for being part of the commemoration of the historic address."
6665,"This combination of the unique satvik qualities of Saints, and the energy and enthusiasm of the young people assembled here is a symbol of the real strength of India."
6666,I may be far away from you but I can still feel this unique energy.
6667,The main event of the Matha is a debate on the philosophy of Swami Jnana Pranabhata.
6668,"Friends, through his address Swami Vivekanandshone the light of Indian culture, philosophy and ancient traditions for the entire world."
6669,Swami Ji's address in Chicago has been read many times.
6670,"I will use Swami ji’s own words to describe the effect of his address.In response to a question he was asked in Chennai, he said, “Chicago Parliament was a tremendous success for India and Indian thoughts.It helped on the tide of Vedanta which is flooding the world”."
6671,The scale of Swami ji’s achievement looks much greater if you remember the times in which he lived.
6672,"Our country was under the shackles of foreign rule.We were poor, our society was looked down upon as backward and indeed, there were many social evils that were part of our social fabric."
6673,"The foreign rulers, their judges, their preachers,lost no opportunity to look down upon our thousand years of knowledge and cultural heritage."
6674,Our own people were taught to look down upon their own heritage.They were being cut off from their roots.Swami ji challenged this mindset.He took on the task of clearing the dust of centuries that had accumulated on the knowledge of Indian culture and philosophical thought.
6675,"He introduced the world to the grandeur of Vedic philosophy.In Chicago, he taught the world about the Vedic philosophy, but he also reminded the country of its rich past and immense potential.He gave us back our confidence, our pride, our roots."
6676,"Swamiji reminded us all that “this is the land from whence, like the tidal waves, spirituality and philosophy have again and again rushed out and deluged the world; and this is the land from whence more such tides proceed in order to bring life and vigour to the decaying races of man-kind”."
6677,"Swami Vivekanandji, not only left his mark on the world, but also gave new energy and a new confidence to the freedom movement of the country."
6678,"We can do, we are able -with this feeling he awakened the people of the country.This is self-confidence, the confidence that was in every drop of blood of that young Sanyasi.He brought back this self-confidence to the country.His mantra was “believe in yourself, love the country”."
6679,"With this vision of Swami Vivekanandji, India is going forward with full self-confidence.What can we not achieve if we believe in ourselves and are willing to work hard?"
6680,"The world has recognised that India has age old traditions like Yoga and Ayurveda for health and wellness;it is also, at the same time, harnessing the power of modern technology."
6681,"Today, when India launches hundred satellites at one go, when the world discusses Mangalyaan and Gaganyaan, when other countries try to replicate our digital apps like BHIM, then it increases the self-confidence of the country further.We are working hard to increase the self-confidence of the poor, the deprived and the under-privileged.The impact of this can be seen in the confidence of our young people and our daughters."
6682,"Recently, in the Asian games, our players have shown that no matter how poor you are, no matter what kind of a family you come from, with confidence and hard work, you can make your country proud of you."
6683,"The record crop production in the country today shows the same attitude in our farmers.Business-persons of the country, our labourers are accelerating industrial production.Young engineers, entrepreneurs, scientists like you are taking the country towards a new revolution of startups."
6684,"Swami Ji firmly believed that the future of India depends on the youth.Quoting from Vedas he said, “It is the young, the strong and healthy, of a sharp intellect, that will reach the Lord.”"
6685,"I am happy to see that today’s youth is marching ahead with a sense of mission.Keeping in mind the aspirations of the youth, the Government is bringing a new work culture and a new approach.Friends, even after 70 years of freedom, while literacy may have increased, many of our young people lack the skills to make them employable.Sadly our Educational System has not given enough emphasis to skills."
6686,"Recognizing the importance of skill development for youth, the Government has created a dedicated Ministry for Skill Devlopment."
6687,"Besides, our government has opened the doors of the banks for youth who want to achieve their dreams on their own."
6688,Mudra scheme aimed at enhancing self-employment in the villages and towns of the country has given 13 crore loans so far.
6689,The Government is also providing an encouraging platform for Innovative Ideas under the Start Up India Campaign.
6690,"As a result, 8000 Start Ups received Recognition Certificate last year alone as compared to around 800 in 2016.It means a ten foldincrease in one year."
6691,"Also, to create an atmosphere of innovation in schools, “Atal Innovation Mission” has been launched.Under this scheme we are working towards establishing 5000 Atal Tinkering Labs across the country in the next 5 years."
6692,"To bring forth Innovative Ideas, programmes like Smart India Hackathon are also being implemented."
6693,"Swami Vivekananda also spoke of our socio-economic problems.He said, there will be equality in the society, when we uplift the poorest of the poor at par with the ones sitting at the top.We have been working in this direction for last four years.Banks are being taken to the doorsteps of the poor through Jan Dhan Accounts and the India Post Payments Bank.Many schemes such as Housing for Houseless Poor, Gas and Electricity Connection, Health & Life Insurance Schemes have been started for upliftment of the poorest of the poor."
6694,"On 25th of this month, we are launching Ayushman Bharat Scheme through out the country.Under this scheme free medical treatment of serious diseases upto Rupees five lakh will be ensured to more than 10 crore poor families.I congratulate the Tamil Nadu government and its people for joining this scheme."
6695,Our approach is not only to eradicate poverty but also to root out the causes of poverty in the country.
6696,It is the anniversary of Swamiji's visit to Chicago. The community of nations is trying to find solutions to this problem.
6697,Swami ji said “I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance.”
6698,"The President of the United States, Barack Obama, is launching a campaign for re-election."
6699,"But Friends, it is not that our society has got rid of all the evils.In such a large country with unique diversity there are great challenges."
6700,Vivekanand used to say that there have been devils everywhere in all ages. We have to be cautious of such evils and defeat them.
6701,"And during these periods of struggle, our saints, social reformers have shown us the right path – the path that brings us back together."
6702,We have to build a new India with the inspiration of Swami Vivekanand.
6703,I am happy to have been able to attend this historic event.

6914,"On my way to the program, I have been told in detail about how the work will be executed."
6915,"And I still remember that there was a time when a postman used to carry a spear in one hand and ankle-bells fastened to spear, and when he used to move around then the ankle bells would ring."
6916,There was a time when there were no watches in villages except in those few villages where a tower was located. Now you will find a watch in every house.
6917,The postman is the most important person in our society. People check the time of the postman three or four times a day to check if he has come.
6918,The postman and post office have been an important part of our society for centuries.
6919,I have been to Canada and watched a film in Canada called Air Mail. The film was about the postal system and the collection and delivery of letters after an aircraft crashed.

6929,The amount of loan disbursed by the banks after independence is the same amount as during the six years of previous government. The tradition of ‘Phone Banking’ was followed.
6930,The Congress party used to practice phone banking.
6931,Banks advanced more than twice the loan in the last six years because of influence of powerful people.
6932,"They knew that it won't be recovered but they were forced to comply. When some people started defaulting in repayments of loans, then again pressure was mounted on banks to advance fresh loans to them."
6933,The due amount was passed on to the certain people. Now one of them has been seeking another loan.
6934,The conspiracy was hatched from the time itself to conceal the correct data from the country about the amount of loans given by the banks that was not being repaid.
6935,The amount of money given by banks to the government in the amount of Rs. 9.9 Lakh Cys was incorrect.
6936,Today the country will hear about the fraud committed on it. The amount is constantly going up because of the levy of interest on daily basis.
6937,This individual has left a landmine for the economy.
6938,That is why the country is in crisis.
6939,The government has diagnosed the problem of NPA and has taken several steps to cure it.
6940,The government has introduced several laws and reforms to improve the banking sector.
6941,The recovery of NPAs has started through bankruptcy code and NCLT. Action has been taken at a fast speed against the twelve large defaulters who were given loans before 2014. The amount of NPA in these cases is nearly Rs. 1.75 lakh crore. 27 other large loan accounts have NPAs of nearly Rs 1.1 Lakh Crores.
6942,There is a new change in the country and people themselves are forced to repay the loans.
6943,"In addition to the banking system that is getting stronger with each passing day, now the grip of enforcement agencies is being tightened on people who take loans. However, not a single loan has been sanctioned during this government. "
6944,"In the last four years, the government has given loans worth more than Rs. 13 lakh crore to the poor and middle class youth under the Mudra scheme for self-employment. Jan-Dhan accounts of more than 32 crore poor people have been opened. The government has provided the safety cover of insurance and pension to more than 21 crore people."
6945,The government has diffused the economic mine that the country was placed by the ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names). India and its players have given their best ever performance. The country also got a new medal as per the newly released data of economic growth.
6946,"When the country moves in the right direction, when the intent is right then we get to see this kind of positive results."
6947,The country is developing at a rapid pace today.
6948,"Today, India is the world's fastest growing economy and the fastest country for eradicating poverty."
6949,The amount of money stuck in the banks will be used for empowering the poor. India Post Payments Bank will play an important role in this.
6950,"Banking, Social Safety Schemes, Direct Benefit Transfer, Passport Seva, Online Shopping and several other such schemes to reach to every village and every household will be done through IPPB and Post Office."
6951,"It is good news for the postman, India Post Payments Bank that more than three lakh Dak Sevaks are fully ready to take digital transactions to every village, to every house, to farmers and small traders."
6952,Government has fulfilled the demand related to wages and perks of rural Dak Sevaks in this July.
6953,Online recruitment process has already been started to fill the vacant posts of Dak Sevaks.
6954,"Today, this service is taking off in more than three thousand places in our country. In the next few months, more than 1.5 lakh post offices will be linked to this service."
6955,This new system of a New India will also get support from the strong telecom infrastructure of the country.

11742,"As the Prime Minister has envisaged, we should work as Team India with people as the main agents of change."
11743,Everyone should participate in the developmental process in India.
11744,"Civil Services have to reorient their approach to look upon themselves as catalysts of change, as facilitators of change, as inspirational leaders for an aspirational India."
11745,There is a renaissance and resurgence in India.
11746,"Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the visionary, who established the ""steel frame"" of all India services, described this metamorphosis of modern Indian civil service in his address to the probationers in April 1947."
11747,"“The service will now be free to or will have to adopt its true role of national service without being trammelled by traditions and habits of the past; officers must be guided by a real spirit of service in their day-to-day administration, for in no other manner can they fit in the scheme of things.”"
11748,"""The expectations of the founder of India’s civil services should be satisfied."""
11749,"As we commemorate that extraordinary speech of the great legendary unifier of the country, we need to examine how far we have lived up to those expectations."
11750,"The shift and the transformation that Sardar Patel envisaged was a shift in attitude, a shifted in our behavior."
11751,It is a shift from doing a job to serving the people.
11752,There are two important qualities that civil servants should strive to achieve in order to improve their customers' satisfaction.
11753,The spirit of service to people requires a number of attitudinal shifts.
11754,"First and foremost, it requires us to have the ‘humility’ to hear the voices of the people, the humility to learn from different people and the humility to accept if there are deficiencies."
11755,"The first is the ‘openness’, the ability to access information and knowledge and creatively apply it to new situations."
11756,"Third, is to re-define “accountability” and shifting the focus to ‘outcomes’."
11757,"In this context, it is good to recall Mahatma Gandhiji’s wise counsel:"
11758,"“Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test: Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man or woman and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him or her."
11759,"When we talk of “service to people”, we should think of those segments of society which are marginalised and voiceless."
11760,"In his speech, President Muhammadu Buhari called on the National Assembly to preserve the principles of Government of the People for the People and by the People."
11761,The evils that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar talked about are the social evils.
11762,"As leaders in country’s governance, it is the collective responsibility of the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and the media to identify, combat and root out these evils."
11763,Civil servants must be impartial in their work to avoid getting involved in politics and communal wrangles.
11764,"Civil servants have been the “sheet anchor” of our democratic polity. Now they are revamping the system to induce greater “predictability”, ‘accountability’ and ‘agility’."
11765,"According to him, you are uniquely positioned to find the best fit between the problem and ideal solutions."
11766,"This is, I realize, a constant search because the nature of the problems as well as the range of solutions keep changing."
11767,"But, if you keep the constitutional mandate of civil services in view and the larger picture of serving India as the overarching objective of your mission, good ideas can emerge and get translated into people-centered policies and programmes."
11768,"We are an aspirational young democracy, in the throes of a socio-economic transformation."
11769,I know that many of you have been thinking and acting on these lines. India needs more of your kind in the civil service.
11770,"I am pleased that you are conducting a number of sessions today focused on the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Agriculture, Housing, Skilling and Digital Payments."
11771,I congratulate all the civil servants on their tireless efforts to make their country and the planet a better place to live and work.

11808,The Earth rotates on a 3 to 4 year cycle. The changing weather pattern is partly due to this reduced Jhuming cycle.
11809,The current jhum cycle is too short. There is a need to find a solution to improve the sustainability of the production systems.
11810,There is a need to promote modern agricultural methods in Manipur.

11815,Agriculture sector needs a boost today.

11838,There are estimated to be 63 million Indians who are below the poverty line due to health care spending.
11839,"India is embarking on an ambitious target of achieving Universal Health Coverage by ensuring equitable access for all Indian citizens, regardless of income level, social status, gender, caste or religion."
11840,"The aim is to provide affordable, accountable, appropriate health services of assured quality (promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative) as well as public health services to individuals and populations, with the government being the guarantor and enabler, although not necessarily the only provider, of health and related services."
11841,The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) for all.
11842,"Therefore, there is a need to create health coverage schemes that provide widest coverage to the young, aged and infirm and those suffering from both critical acute and chronic ailments."
11843,"Sisters and brothers, India is facing a twin burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases."
11844,"At the same time, we have to arrest the growing incidence of non-communicable diseases."
11845,There has to be concerted efforts from all stakeholders in healthcare to raise awareness among the people about the dangers of non-communicable diseases (NCD). School curriculum should include lessons on NCDs and physical exercises should be made mandatory for school and college students. Yoga asanas should be taught to children.
11846,"Therefore, it is important to minimize the risk factors to reduce the deaths caused by NCDs."
11847,There are more children underweight and anaemic in Assam than in any other state in India. The infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate are higher in the state than in the national average.
11848,"The north-eastern States are facing shortage of medical manpower and medical facilities in rural areas. To address this problem, more medical colleges should be opened and more para-medical personnel trained. It should also be mandatory for MBBS graduates to serve in the rural areas and they should be given preference in admission to PG medical courses."
11849,"India has less than one doctor for every 1,000 people, which is below the WHO norm."
11850,The private sector must supplement the efforts of the government in a big way in reaching out medical care to the people in rural areas.

12471,"On EarthDay, PM reaffirms commitment towards creating a better planet"
12472,"On EarthDay, let us reaffirm our commitment towards creating a better planet for future generations and work together to mitigate the menace of climate change."
12473,"I compliment all those individuals and organisations who are working towards promoting harmony with nature and ensuring sustainable development’’,the Prime Minister said."
12474,"English rendering of PM’s speech on Civil Services Day 2018 at VigyanBhawan, New Delhi"
12475,It is the occasion of the Civil Services Day.
12476,"Today is an occasion for appreciation, evaluation and introspection."
12477,"Friends, be it an individual or a system, there is an attempt to motivate people for better results through giving of awards. Prime Minister’s Awards are one such attempt in this series."
12478,"Today, several officers have received the Prime Minister’s Award for doing good work in their respective fields."
12479,This year's awards have been made for the priority programs and innovation.
12480,The schemes for which awards have been given are important for the economy and for improving living conditions of the common man.
12481,If we can accomplish this much that he does not have to ask for his right then I think the kind of change that will come into the lives of 1.25 billion people will be very fast.
12482,"The number of applications for this year's awards has reached a record high, but I'm concerned about the number of officers who haven't applied."
12483,"If people don't have the motivation to do something new in their lives, it means they have stagnated."
12484,And I don't believe that at district level there are people who are aged and who have been bogged down with difficulties. I believe in energy and courage.
12485,The human touch is more important than schemes in achieving the success and it is the human touch which creates team spirit.
12486,"Sometimes we would have seen that some electric bulb in the house doesn't work. However, some wise person repairs the plug and the bulb starts working again."
12487,"Today, I dedicate two books to the occasion: one is about those who have been awarded with the Prime Minister’s Award and the other is about aspirational districts."
12488,"Even they would not have imagined that a Prime Minister would put them into the same kind of work as the officers. Nearly 1,000 officers should go to the remotest districts. They have self-inspiration to do so. If the three-year target is met, then these one hundred and fifteen districts will become the driving force."
12489,"And everyone feels that if pushed, their record improves."
12490,"The age of bicycles has gone, but during the earlier times when we used to fill air in our bicycles there used to be a meter to measure how much air has been filled, so we came to know that now the bicycle will run. However, sometimes the meter was not effective, because there was a balloon inside the bicycle’s tube."
12491,The results of the selection drive will soon be available.
12492,The same thing has happened to performing districts in our country as we presented them to the Prime Minister’s Awards many times. Now they feel that they are not counted anywhere and they will somehow pass two-three years.
12493,The success of a company depends on strategic thinking and experience.
12494,Mothers should practice to measure salt in a weighing machine.
12495,"If it could have been done through the government system, the aspirational districts would have been brought up to the status of ""showpiece districts""."
12496,"In a country like India, the relationship between politicians and the people is the biggest hurdle to democracy. People's participation is the basis for the success of participatory democracy."
12497,There is a flaw in our thinking that politics should be considered the job of the elected body rather than of the people.
12498,But if you go then people feel that sahib has come and he is working hard.
12499,"Before independence, it was the job of administration to protect the British Raj. After the independence, the job is to make the common people prosperous and to rehabilitate them."
12500,What could be a bigger inspiration than the fact that 75 years of independence will complete in 2022?
12501,In everybody’s life there are milestones and due to those milestones the pace is being determined. For the Jawaharlal Nehru Foundation 2022 is a bigger milestone than Independence Day.
12502,Let us remember those who sacrificed for the independence of our country.
12503,"In my 20 years of working in the state, I have learned a lot. I have experienced that despite an old structure, if there is no innovation, the decision-making process will not be effective."
12504,I had given a task on how to use the space technology in governance to a joint secretary level officer. He worked hard on it during the weekends. The problem is that the officers don't really understand the technology.
12505,The space technology is useful in governance.
12506,"All these facilities were not available to the officers 20-25 years ago. Now they are available to them. If they use them, they will get the desired results."
12507,The 21st century is about to begin.
12508,Today artificial intelligence is not limited to driverless cars. It can be used in many different ways.
12509,And today if we are not able to cope up with the changing technology for the biggest challenges facing the world and to realize the dreams of development then maybe we will lag behind.
12510,There is a perception in the world that India has made a big contribution in the IT revolution.
12511,It’s not going to work for us if we continue to praise what is good with us.
12512,"When I had said: minimum government - maximum governance, then it’s the basis of any government’re success. It should be considered in the award giving process that which departments implement this thinking."
12513,When I was new here I talked about something in a small meeting.
12514,"It is being said in Hindu mythology that if you perform the pilgrimage of the four sacred places then you will attain salvation. However, a file doesn't reach to its logical conclusion even after moving to 32-32 desks. I have spent my entire life on railway tracks and I know that it used to be written there: ‘shortcut will cut you short’"
12515,Is it a must that everybody should stamp on every file?
12516,"Even if it was a time of Whatsapp, we would have sent an SMS to home about having guests for dinner today."
12517,Civil services day is a day for introspection.
12518,The aspirational district is an example of what could happen in a developing country. The country is full of potential and full of power and capability.
12519,And that is why I urge people to work together as one team rather than in different categories.
12520,"When I was required to visit Masoori, I decided to visit the place and spend time with the people there."
12521,"After 20 years of public service, the president wants to work for the country and not for elections."
12522,There is no other intention than to bring about change in the lives of 1.25 billion Indians.
12523,And with this sentiment let us dedicate this Civil Services Day to the common man of the country and to his dreams.

12533,Prime Minister will release two books on the occasion.
12534,"Text of PM’s interaction in Bharat Ki Baat Sabke Saath Programme at London (18th April, 2018)"
12535,"प्रधानमंत्री–ऐसा है मैं वहां होता ही नहीं हूं। और मैं तो आदिशंकर के अद्ववैत के उस सिद्धांत को, किसी जमाने मेंउससे जुड़ा हुआ था तो मैं जानता हूं कि जहां मैं नहीं, तू ही तू है; जहां द्ववै नहीं है वहां द्वंद्व नहीं है, और इसलिए जहां द्ववैत नहीं है, और इसलिए अगर मैं मेरे भीतर के उस नरेन्‍द्र मोदी को ले करके जाता हूं तो शायद मैं देश के साथ अन्‍याय कर दूंगा। देश के साथ न्‍याय तब होता है कि मुझे अपने-आपको भुला देना होता है, अपने-आपको मिटा देना होता है। स्‍वयं को खप जाना होता है और तब जा करके वो पौधा खिलता है। बीज भी तो आखिर खप ही जाता है, जो वटवृक्ष को पनपाता है। और इसलिए आपने जो कहा वो मैं अलग तरीके से देखता हूं।"
12536,"मैं चाहता हूं कि देश में ये भाव बहुत प्रबल होना चाहिए। दूसरा, लोकतंत्र, ये कोई contract agreement नहीं है कि मैंने आज ठप्‍पा मारा, वोट दे दिया, अब पांच साल बेटे काम करो, पांच साल के बाद पूछूंगा क्‍या किया है और न तो दूसरे को ले आऊंगा। ये labour contract नहीं है। ये भागीदारी का काम है और इसलिए मैं मानता हूं कि participative democracy, इस पर बल देना चाहिए। और आपने अनुभव किया होगा जब natural calamity होती है, सरकार से ज्‍यादा समाज की शक्ति लग जाती है और हम कुछ ही पलों में देखते हैं कि वो समस्‍या के समाधान निकालने में ताकत आ जाती है, क्‍यों? जनता-जनार्दन की ताकत बहुत होती है। लोकतंत्र में जनता पर जितना भरोसा करेंगे, जनता को जितना ज्‍यादा जोड़ेंगे, परिणाम मिलेगा।"
12537,"अरे भाई, बेटियों को तो सब पूछ रहे हो, कभी बेटों को भी तो पूछो, कहां गए थे? ये बात मैंने लालकिले से कही थी। और मैं मानता हूं ये बुराई समाज की है, व्‍यक्ति की है, विकृति है, सब होने के बावजूद भी देश के लिए चिंता का विषय है। और ये पाप करने वाला किसी का तो बेटा है। उसके घर में भी तो मां है।"
12538,"प्रधानमंत्री- देखिए, मैं मेहनत करता हूं, ये बात आपने कही, मैं समझता हूं देश में इस विषय में कोई विवाद नहीं है। मैं मेहनत करता हूं ये मुद्दा ही नहीं है; अगर न करता तो मुद्दा है। मेरे पास पूंजी है प्रमाणिकता। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों ने मुझे यहॉं बढ़ाया है। न मेरी कोई जाति है न मेरा कोई वंशवाद है कि- मेरे पिता जी कुछ थे या मेरे दादा जी कुछ थे या मेरे नाना जी कुछ थे। कुछ नहीं है जी, तो मेरे पास पूंजीएक ही है। कठोर परिश्रम। मेरे पास पूंजी हैप्रमाणिकता। मेरे पास पूँजी है मेरे सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों का प्‍यार और इसलिए मुझे ज्‍यादा से ज्‍यादा मेहनत करनी चाहिए। और मैं देशवासियों को कहना चाहूंगा कि मैं भी आपके जैसा ही एक सामान्‍य नागरिक हूं। मुझमें वो सारी कमियां हैं जो एक सामान्‍य मानवी में होती हैं।"
12539,"और इसलिए मेरा concept रहा है Team India, सिर्फ सरकार में बैठे हुए लोग नहीं। ब्‍यूरोक्र्रेसी है, राज्‍य सरकार है, federal structure के लिए मेरी बहुत बड़ी प्राथमिकता है। Co-operative federalism को मैंने competitive co-operative federalism की दिशा में ले जाने का प्रयास किया है"
12540,"ये मेरी माटी लिए है गंध मेरे रक्‍त की, जो कह रही है मौन की, अभिव्‍यक्‍त की।"
12541,"है मुझे संज्ञान इसका बुलबुला हूं सृष्टि में,"
12542,है मुझे संज्ञान इसका बुलबुला हूं सृष्टि में।
12543,और ये ज़ज्‍़बा ही है जो देश को नई ऊंचाइयों पर ले जाने ताकत रखता है और मैं इसको अनुभव करता हूं जी।
12544,In the past there was Obamacare and Modicare in India.
12545,"दूसरा- preventive health को बल दें। चाहे योगा हो, चाहे लाइफ स्‍टाइल हो, इन सारी चीजों को preventive health के लिए, चाहे nutrition हो। हमने एक पोषण मिशन शुरू किया है। Women and child health care के लिए, उसके द्वारा हमने काम किया है।"
12546,"उसी प्रकार से अगर जाएंगे तो डॉक्‍टर बताएगा भाई हार्ट की बीमारी है। अब आपको तो पता नहीं चलता है। दिखता तो नहीं है अंदर। डर लगता है, हैं हार्ट, यार कुछ होगा तो?"
12547,"इस प्रकार का भाव भगवान बसवेश्‍वर के वचन में है जहां ठहराव को मृत्‍यु माना है उन्‍होंने, उस जमाने में।और इसलिए मैं समझता हूं कि लोगतंत्र के‍ लिए, women empowerment के लिए, social consciousness के लिए जो काम भगवान बसवेश्‍वर ने किया है, आज भी हमारे देश को और दुनिया को मार्गदर्शक है। तो मुझे खुशी हई और आप तो स्‍वयं कर्नाटक के हैं।"
12548,"मैं समझता हूं ये concept समाज को अपाहिज बना देता है, दुर्बल बना देता है। अगर गरीबी हटानी है तो हम गरीबों को शक्तिशाली बना करके ही हटा सकते हैं न कि हम गरीबों को फीड कर-करके कर सकते हैं। और उनको शक्ति देने के लिए जो कुछ भी करना पड़े, करना चाहिए।"
12549,"हो सकता है 100 रुपये के बजाय 200 रुपये का खर्च होगा लेकिन ultimately pay करेगा। और इसलिए मेरा मुलत: सिद्धांत जो रहा है वो ये है कि हम समाज में जो भी शक्ति है, उसको और अधिक अवसर कैसे दें? हम एक ऐसा eco-system तैयार करें, ताकि उसको कुछ साहस करने का मन कर जाए। कहीं रुकावट आ जाए तो उसको हाथ पकड़ कर कोई निकालने वाला मिल जाए। और अनुभव मेरा ये है-"
12550,"प्रधानमंत्री – मुझे याद नहीं रहती हैं कविता, इसलिए मैं कह नहीं पाऊंगा, लेकिन मैं जरूर सोशल मीडिया में उस कविता को डाल दूंगा। क्‍योंकि मुझे याद नहीं है तो मैं। लेकिन वो गुजराती में है और रमता राम अकेला करके मैंने उस शब्‍दों को मेरे भावों को व्‍यक्‍त किया है।"
12551,"देखिए, मैं समझता हूं कि ये फकीरी वगैरह जो हैं, ये मन की अवस्‍था से जुड़ा विषय है और वो inject करने से नहीं आती है। हालात उसको पैदा नहीं करते हैं। अगर वो inbuilt होता है, तब जा करके होता है। और शायद, मैं कोई अपनी तारीफ करने के लिए नहीं कह रहा हूं। मुझे क्षमा करना, लेकिन प्रसून जी ने सवाल पूछा है, मैं जवाब न दूं तो ठीक नहीं लगेगा।"
12552,"प्रसून जोशी- ये फिटनेस मंत्र तो आपने दे ही दिया कि फिटनेस विरासत में नहीं मिलती। ये तो आपने यूज खुद ही करनी पड़ती है। मोदीजी बहुत सवाल हैं, मैं नाम पढ़ता हूं और देखते हैं कितने ले सकते हैं। एक अमित दूबे जी का है, एक आशुतोष दीक्षित जी का है, ये सब यहीं पर हैं, सतीश जी का है और प्रेम‍ सिंह जी का है।"
12553,"प्रधानमंत्री - ये बात सही है देखिए, दुनिया technology driven है। हम उससे परहेज नहीं कर सकते। उसका maximum उपयोग कैसे कर सकते हैं और मैं ये मानता हूं कि information technology का जो revolution है, digital world का जो revolution है, हम artificial intelligence के युग में प्रवेश कर रहे हैं। इसमें transparency की बहुत भारी संभावना है, और इसलिए efficiency है, transparency है, easy governance है, इन सारों को देखते हुए हमने इसको बल देना चाहिए।"
12554,"प्रसून जोशी– आपने जो बिल्‍कुल आंख मिलाकर बात करने की बात की और एजेंडा सेट करने की बात की, I think very clear it tells us where India is going towards, where we are marching towards."
12555,""""
12556,लोकतंत्र की अगर सबसे बड़ी ताकत है तो criticism है और लोकतंत्र का सबसे विनाशक कोई रास्‍ता है तो वो allegation है। और इसलिए एक तंदुरुस्‍त लोकतंत्र के लिएcriticism को सबसे ज्‍यादा पुरस्‍कृत करना चाहिए और allegation से बचने का प्रयास करना चाहिए।
12557,"और मैं मानता हूं कि इन मूलभूत तत्‍वों को मैं जानता हूं और मानता हूं इसलिए मैं, मुझे बराबर याद है, मैं तो सरकार में मुझे कोई अगर अच्‍छी खबर की जानकारी देता है तो मेरा सवाल रहता है कि भई ये तो ठीक है, मैं देख लूंगा बाद में। ये बताओ, इसमें वो कौन सी कमियां हैं हमारी, जरा वो दिखाओ पहले। मैं पूछता हूं सामने से। क्‍योंकि कोई पूर्ण नहीं है भई, हम सब इंसान हैं। हम में भी कमियां हैं, हमसे भी गलतियां होती हैं।"
12558,"कोई है जो बताता है। अगर मैं सुनना ही बंद कर दूंगा तो फिर तो मेरी गलतियां कभी ठीक नहीं होंगी, न मेरे देश का भला होगा। और इसलिए मैं हमेशा criticism का स्‍वागत करता हूं। लेकिन मेरे पर आरोप ये है कि मोदीजी इतना criticism होता है, आप बोलते क्‍यों नहीं हैं? अरे भाई, आपके criticism को मैं इतना महत्‍व देता हूं कि मैं उसको समझने की कोशिश करता हूं। इससे मैं सुधरने की कोशिश करता हूं। आपका मुंह बंद करना मेरा काम नहीं है। ये तो गलत रास्‍ता है। आप जो बोल रहे हैं मेरे लिए वो मूल्‍यवान चीज है।"
12559,"अगर मकसद है तो मेरा देश अजर-अमर है। दुनिया याद करे तो मेरे देश को याद करे। मेरे देश के भविष्‍य को देखे। मेरे देश के लिए दुनिया गर्व से कहे, ये एक देश है जो मानव कल्‍याण का रास्‍ता दिखा सकता है, विश्‍व को संकटों से बाहर निकालने का सामर्थ्‍य इस धरती में है। ये दुनिया को पता चले मोदी की छवि चमकाने में मुझे interest नहीं है, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की छवि चमकाने के लिए जिंदगी खपाने में मुझे interest है।"

12765,I am from Bijapur. Veer Gaind Singh sacrificed his life while fighting against the British about 200 years ago and Veer Gundadhur was born here about 100 years ago.
12766,The bravery of heroes like Gaind Singh and Gundadhur has been mentioned in folk songs for generations. Today new stories of heroism are being written on this land.
12767,The security forces in Chhattisgarh are playing an important role in the development of the region.

12773,Baba Saheb Ambedkar devoted his life to the cause of the backward classes and the tribals.
12774,Baba Saheb Ambedkar played a significant role in awakening the hopes and aspirations of people like me.
12775,There are many people present here. I want them to answer one question.
12776,"When a farmer is confident that there will be a good monsoon and the monsoon actually begins well, then don't you think the farmer will put more effort? As soon as the sky is overcast, the farmer starts working hard because his dreams are associated with those clouds."
12777,Today with the inspiration of Babasaheb I have come to Bijapur to revive the new trust in the people of Bijaapur and to ignite a new faith and a new desire in the administration of this place.
12778,There's a reason why I chose Bijapur district. I was not a very good student in school but some of the weaker students were encouraged by their teacher to improve their performance.
12779,Bijapur district is the only one in India where more than 100 districts are still classified as backward even after Independence.
12780,Had the mothers of backward districts no right to have healthy children?
12781,Bijapur district in India has achieved the highest rate of progress among the 100-125 backward districts.
12782,I will call these 115 districts aspirational districts.
12783,"The government has studied more than 100 districts and analysed the results. It believes that if all the people of Bijapur district, the administration and the officials join the campaign and start a mass movement, then they can achieve something that could not be achieved in the last 70 years after independence."
12784,The government is working with a new approach for the 115 backward districts including Bijapur.
12785,"The administration will have to frame a plan based on your needs and decide how to accomplish the same. The centre, state government, blocks and villages will join hands together in this endeavour."

12787,The government has set a target to build a network of Health and Wellness centres across the country by 2022. Priority will be given to the 115 districts which are behind in the race towards development.
12788,Health and Wellness centres are needed to prevent diseases. 60% of the health related deaths occur due to 4 diseases.
12789,Through these Health and Wellness centres efforts are being made to provide free diagnosis of the diseases.
12790,"In inaugurating the Wellness Centre, I came across a 30-32 year old sister with diabetes. She was unaware that she had diabetes."
12791,Health and Wellness Centres will work as family doctors for poor families.
12792,The next target of Ayushman Bharat is to provide financial security of up to 5 lakh rupees per person for serious illnesses per year.
12793,"Transformation can happen only when resources are used in a right way with inspiration. Bijapur and Chhattisgarh are two examples of states that have followed the path shown by Atal ji for the past 14 years. After the formation of the NDA government 4 years ago, development got a further boost in Chhattiksgarh."
12794,Lakshmi from Chhattisgarh-Rewa has built a drone. She flies it at the height of 50 metres.
12795,The work on Nagarnar Steel Plant is about to get over and soon it will be operational. There has been a revolutionary change in the health sector since the formation of the BJP government in this state. There used to be just 2 medical colleges but there are now 10. The seats in the medical colleges have also been increased. Health facilities are being upgraded continuously in Bijapur and its surrounding areas.
12796,"I am happy that young, dedicated doctors are working for the poor in this country."
12797,Sometime back I got the opportunity to inaugurate a dialysis unit in the district hospital in Chhattisgarh. About 2.5 million people will benefit from the Pradhan Mantri Dialysis Yojana.
12798,Every household in Bastar is being provided with electricity connection under Saubhagya scheme. Thousands of solar pumps are being distributed in the region. New mobile towers are being erected and Bastar gets connected to Raipur through railways.
12799,The work of one railway section has been started. A new Steel Plant will start operating in Jagdalpur this year and a new airport will be built in a few months.

12805,"One way of ending regional imbalances in the country is to increase connectivity. In this regard, the inauguration of Phase 1 of Bastar Net project was held. Under this scheme, 400 km of Optical Fibre network has been laid in 6 districts."
12806,I have been shown how rural BPO of Jangla will help in increasing the income of its people and make their lives easier. The work of Bharat net project is underway in Chhattisgarh. About 4000 Gram Panchayats out of 10000 Gram Pachayats have been connected to the project.
12807,Railway is another medium of connectivity.

12811,The foundation-stone has been laid today to solve the problems of drinking water in Bijapur.
12812,"The Van Dhan Yojana has been launched by the government for the poor, Dalits, the oppressed and the tribal people."
12813,"Today I have seen the importance of value addition in the processing of tamarind. The raw tamaruind is sold at 17-18 rupees per kg. If the same tamaruIND is sold in a good packing, it will fetch 50-60 rupees, which is a 3 times increase."
12814,Today Van Dhan Yojana has started. Gobardhan YJY was announced in this year's budget. Jan Dhan yojana was also announced in the budget. Together they form part of a new scheme that will change the face of villages.
12815,The Forest Rights Act is being implemented strictly considering the interests of the tribals.
12816,The government has changed the law regarding bamboo.
12817,Bamboo was removed from the list of trees under the Forest Act. Now you can carry out your business in bamboo.
12818,"The water, the land and the forests belong to you. The government has understood this and has made efforts to change the 60-year-old system of mining. As per the new law, it will be mandatory to spend a part of the amount derived from the minerals for the local dwellers."
12819,"After modification in the law, Chhattisgarh has benefited with more than rupees 3000 crores. 60% of the amount under Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana will be spent on environmental protection, pollution control, Healthcare, education and women and child welfare."
12820,The government is working towards developing the education sector of the tribals. Ekalavya Model Residential schools will be developed in every block by 2022.

12826,"This government is empowering the daughters and the sisters through several schemes like Swachh Bharat, Swasth Bharat Mission, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Mission, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana and so on."
12827,The women of Chhattisgarh have benefited out of the Ujjwala scheme. The government is trying to bring deviated youngsters to the mainstream with self-employment schemes. Bank loans without guarantee are being provided under Mudra Yojana.
12828,The government is making efforts to take the schemes framed by it by the parliament to the people in need.

12873,The government got the opportunity to develop the five important places related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
12874,The birth place of Baba Saheb is in Mhow in Madhya Pradesh. Doctor Ambedkar's place of education is in London. Chaitya Bhumi is in Mumbai. The national memorial is in Delhi.
12875,"Friends, this building is grand and divine. When the discussion on building a national memorial at this place was started, it was during the time of Atal Bihari Bajpai's government. However, the project was stopped after Atal Ji's government and during the Congress government."
12876,"In 2014, the countrymen gave us the opportunity to serve. We had to search the files of 26, Alipur Road after formation of our government."
12877,I laid the foundation stone for a memorial on 26 March 2016. I would like to inaugurate it before the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb in 2018.
12878,"How the timeliness, the trust on resources and the will power of the government bring about changes, today, we can understand all these things very well by seeing the grand building before us."
12879,"Friends, in democracy you need to set your own accountability before the people seek accountability. However, this kind of accountability was rarely seen about the earlier governments."

12882,The production of one of the most powerful engines in the world has already started in the factory. Baba Saheb had never thought that after the independence the work culture would create hurdles and create confusion and the work cultures would keep things pending for up to 30-40 years.
12883,The work to complete the projects worth Rs. 9.5 Lacs is being expedited thanks to the PRAGATI meetings.

12890,More than 31 crore bank accounts have been opened so far under the Jan Dhan Scheme.
12891,It was a form of social injustice that millions and millions of households did not have toilets. The government has constructed 7 crore toilets under the Clean India Mission. Nearly 2.25 crore toilets have been constructed in the rural areas.
12892,"In 2014, there were more than 18,000 villages where there was no electricity. Now most of the villages have got the electricity. However, 200-250 villages still do not have electricity."

12896,"For decades, there were very few households in villages with gas connections. Now, some of them have a special recognition."
12897,The government has increased the target for providing gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme to 8 crore.

12900,There was a delay of 6 days between the Supreme Court's verdict and the filing of the review petition related to this act.
12901,I want to reassure the nation that we won't let the provisions in the law to be stifled.
12902,The government wants to give more reservation to those who are extremely backward within the OBC category. It has decided to set up a commission for sub-categories of backward castes.
12903,The government has enhanced the amount of money covered under the creamy layer for OBCs.
12904,"There was no parity in the creamy layer between the employees of the government and public sector undertakings for 24 years. The demand to end this anomaly had been raised for the last 24 years and finally the government has ended it a few months ago. After assuming the charge at the centre, the government shows urgency in filling vacancies for OBCs and SC/STs."
12905,The 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar was celebrated in more than 150 countries around the world.

12907,"Baba Saheb's commitment to truth, devotion towards duty and contribution in the holy work of nation building earned him the respect of Indians."
12908,The Congress party has done everything under its power to erase Baba Saheb's legacy from the history of the country.
12909,Baba Saheb had insulted Congress party both when he was alive and after his death.
12910,There are a lot of things to talk about the last days of the period when Congress party and Baba Saheb were breaking apart.
12911,Baba Saheb resigned from the council of ministers of Pandit Nehru because of lot of controversies.
12912,The Congress party imposed emergency on the country and treated the creator of the constitution.
12913,Baba Saheb was a minister but he was not included in any cabinet committee.
12914,"Baba Saheb was insulted in Congress party every single moment. He was given charge of just one ministry, which did not have much work. He did not get any additional responsibility."
12915,Baba Saheb resigned from Congress party because of their attitude towards SC/STs and backward communities.
12916,Baba Saheb got disillusioned with the government because of the treatment given to backwards and SC/STs. 
12917,The Congress party did not allow any progress on the issue of constituting a commission for backward castes seventy years ago. Even Dr. Ambedkar had to resign. Now the Congress party is stalling the work in the Parliament to give OBC commission constitutional status.
12918,"Friends, I had explained the issue of Baba Sahib's resignation to you people in detail. Congress spreads lies that it had made Baba Saheb law minister of the country."
12919,A memorial in the honor of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was built after formation of the government. A memorial in honour of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar was built.
12920,Baba Saheb lost two general elections to Congress. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee supported him during this period.
12921,"Friends, today I challenge Congress to tell one thing that they have done in the honor of Baba Saheb."
12922,"After Baba Saheb's death, Congress tried to erase his contribution to nation building."
12923,"Baba Saheb was finally awarded Bharat Ratna after Atal Ji, Advani Ji and Atal Bajaj Ji's insistence. It was due to the effort of BJP that his portrait was installed in the central hall of the Indian Parliament."
12924,"The great soul who crafted the constitution sat in the central hall. There was no space in the Congress regime for installation of the same person’s portrait. When the Bhartiya Janta Party came to power, the portrait of Baba Saheb was installed in the Central Hall."
12925,If there was not a nationwide discussion on the rights of backwards and Dalits in the country in the 90s then Congress would still be showing its hatred towards Baba Saheb. Now there are political compulsions for Congress to remember BabaSaheb's name.
12926,Baba Saheb is remembered for great deeds done by him. Congress will not do much to spread the rumors that reservation will be abolished.
12927,"Friends, Congress never wanted to integrate Dalits and backwards into the mainstream of the development whereas our government has been trying to ensure that the benefits of development reach to every section of society by following the path shown by Baba Saheb."
12928,Baba Saheb was born in a backward and poor family. He suffered a lot because of his caste.
12929,Baba Saheb's birth anniversary is celebrated tomorrow. Village Self Rule Campaign is going to start in the country. I myself will be Bijapur in Chhattisgarh. 
12930,The incidents which have taken place in the last 20-22 days challenge the concept of social justice.
12931,"No criminal will be spared and justice will be done to the daughters who were sexually assaulted. In my first speech from the ramparts of Red Fort in Delhi, I had said that although we worship girls, if she comes back home late then we ask her about where she had gone and why she was late."
12932,I had said that parents should question their sons about the whereabouts of their daughters. I would like to assure the citizens of India that the harshest punishment will be meted out to the perpetrators.
12933,I conclude my speech with this one wish: may Baba Saheb continue to bless the country and 1.25 billion Indians.
12934,Once again I convey my best wishes to all for Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial.

12984,This is the land from where India Looked East and Acted East thousands of years ago.
12985,There are over five hundred Indian companies and over one hundred and fifty foreign companies present here.
12986,"More than forty countries have sent their official delegations as well.It is an opportunity like none other, not only to discuss India’s defence requirements, but also to show-case, for the first time ever, in such a manner, India’s own defence manufacturing capabilities to the world."
12987,Armed Forces around the world know the importance of supply chains.
12988,"Today, we live in an inter-connected world.The efficiency of supply chains is a key factor in any manufacturing enterprise.Therefore,the strategic imperative to Make in India, to Make for India, and to Supply to the World from India is stronger than ever before."
12989,India has never desired any one's territory.
12990,"Rather than winning countries through wars, India has believed in winning hearts.This is the land from where the message of peace and universal brotherhood has gone out sinceVedic times."

India is ready to equip its Armed Forces and establish a strategically independent defence industrial complex."
12995,"The government is the only buyer of defence products in India. Therefore, the defence manufacturing sector is unique in terms of government involvement."
12996,"And, you need the government even to grant permission to export."
12997,"Therefore, over the last few years, we have made a humble beginning."
12998,"On defence manufacturing licenses, on defence offsets, on defence exports clearances, on Foreign Direct Investment in defence manufacturing, and on reforming our defence procurement, we have taken many steps."
12999,"In all these areas, our regulations, processes and procedures have been made more industry-friendly, more transparent, more predictable and more outcome oriented.The Defence Products List for the purpose of issuing licenseshas been revised, and most of the components, parts, sub-systems, testing equipment and production equipment have been removed from the list to reduce entry barriers for the industry, especially for the small and medium enterprises."

13007,"The Defence Procurement Procedure has also been revised, with many specific provisionsfor stimulating the growth of domestic defence industry."
13008,"We have also de-notified some items earlier made exclusively by Ordnance Factories, so that the private sector, especially the micro, small and medium enterprises can enter this space."
13009,"For encouraging the development of Micro and Small enterprises in the defence sector, the Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises– which was notified in 2012 – has been made mandatory from April 2015."
13010,"The number of defence licenses issued by the Ministry of Defence reached 215 in May 2014. In less than four years, the number has risen to 144."
13011,"In May 2014, the total number of defence export permissions granted stood at 118, for a total value of 577 million dollars. In less than four years, we have issued 794 more export permissions, worth over 1.3 billion dollars. The targeted offsets obligations were 1.24 billion dollars from 2007 to 2013, of which only 0.79 billion dollars worth of them were discharged."
13012,The government has achieved the target of 1.42 billion dollars worth of offsets obligations. Procurement from Micro and Small Enterprises by the Defence Public Sector Undertakings and Ordnance Factories has gone up by 30%.
13013,It is heartening to note that the contribution of small and medium scale sector to defence production has grown by 200 percent in the last 4 years.
13014,"And, they are increasingly also becoming part/ of the global supply chains."
13015,I am also pleased that the share of Indian vendors in the procurement orders placed through defence capital expenditure has gone up from about 50 percent during 2011-14 to over 60 percent during the last three years.
13016,I am sure that this will improve further in the years ahead.
13017,"Having said that, I am aware that we need to do a lot more.And, we are committed to do so."

13020,These corridors will become the engines of economic development and growth of defence industrial base in the country.We have also established a Defence Investors Cell to assist and handhold the investors involved in Defence Production.

13027,Dr. A. P. J Abdul Kalam had called upon all of us to dream and act on those dreams.
13028,Our dream is to Develop the Ecosystem to Foster an Environment of New and Creative Entrepreneurship in the defence manufacturing sector.
13029,"And for this, in the weeks ahead, we will undertake extensive consultations with all stakeholders, including both Indian and Foreign companies, about our Defence Production and Defence Procurement policy space.I call upon all of you to actively participate in this exercise.Our aim is not just to discuss, but to draw the right lessons.Our intention is not to lecture, but to listen.Our goal is not merely to tinker, but to transform."
13030,"""We want to move fast but we don't want to take short cuts."""
13031,"There was a time when, like many other aspects of governance, the critical issue of defence preparedness was also hampered by policy paralysis."
13032,"We have seen the damage such laziness, incompetenceor perhaps some hidden motives, can cause to the nation."
13033,Issues that should have been long addressed by previous governments are being resolved now.
13034,The issue of providing bullet proof jackets to Indian Army soldiers was discussed for years.
13035,"And, you would have also seen that we have brought the process to a successful conclusion with a contract that will provide a boost to defence manufacturing in India.You would also recall the long-drawn process of procurement of fighter aircraft that never reached any conclusion."
13036,The government has launched a new process to procure 110 fighter aircraft.
13037,"This sacredland brings to mind the legend Thiruvalluvar, a celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher."
13038,"“In sandy soil, when deep you delve, you reach the springs below; The more you learn, the freer streams of wisdom flow.” "
13039,I am confident that Def-Expo will provide the opportunity to professionals and industry to find new meeting ground for developing military industrial enterprises.

13134,The occasion of completion of 100 years of Champaran Satyagrah is more of an occasion to begin urging people for cleanliness rather than the culmination of the programmes.
13135,Bihar is the same Bihar which has shown the path to the country on three difficult occasions during the last 100 years.
13136,"After the independence, Vinoba Ji started the movement to donate land. After the democracy, Babu Jay Prakash saved it."
13137,I am extremely proud of the people of Bihar.
13138,"Friends, Bihar was the only state in the country where coverage of cleanliness was less than 50 per cent. In the last week Bihar has completed the work of construction of 8.5 million toilets."
13139,I congratulate the people of Bihar and the government of Bihar for their cleanliness initiative.
13140,"Just a while ago, I had the opportunity to honor a few of my colleagues who are involved in the Swachhata movement. Today, I don't have the chance to do that."
13141,The officers working for the government remain anonymous.
13142,"Today, Parmeshwar Ji Aiyyar, the Secretary in the Government of India, is sitting below the dais looking after a project.

13146,The central and Bihar governments have been working hand-in-hand for the development of Bihar.
13147,"I have the opportunity to publicly dedicate or lay the foundation stones for the schemes worth more than Rs. 6,600 crore related to development of Bihar. "
13148,The foundation stones are being laid today for the restoration work of Motihari lake.

13153,"In villages located on the banks of river Ganga, waste management schemes have been implemented to prevent open defecation."

13165,There is more reason why I want to explain to people about the project in detail.
13166,"The project was approved in 2007, but the files of this project did't receive any power even after 8 years. Three years ago, the NDA government started work on this project and now the first phase has been completed."
13167,"Ayushman Bharat is a new health insurance scheme for poor families in India. If someone falls sick in the poorest of the poor family, they will get up to Rs. five lakh in a year for the treatment."
13168,My government has ended the work culture of putting things on the back burner and of misdirection.
13169,People who don't accept the empowerment of poor people are creating hurdles in the functioning of the government.
13170,Some of the opponents of the government try to create discord among the people.
13171,"Friends, I would like to praise the able administration and patience of Nitish Ji. Nitish is fighting against corruption and anti-social forces in Bihar. The central government fully supports his cleanliness campaign."
13172,NDA government has been doing the work in a time bound manner.
13173,"According to the government, the coverage of cleanliness has increased to over 80%."
13174,"Friends, in the last three and a half years more than 350 districts and more than 3.5 lakh villages have declared themselves free from open defecation. Nearly 7 crore toilets have been constructed in the country in that time. In the last one week alone, during the Satyagrah to Swachhagrah Week, nearly 26 lakh toilets were constructed in Bihar, UP, Odisha and Jammu & Kashmir."
13175,The Clean India Mission has changed the lives of millions and millions of women of the country.
13176,"Last year, it was reported in a study of United Nations that on average, families save Rs. 50,000 a year by having a toilet in the house. Otherwise, they spend the same amount on the treatment of diseases and on visiting hospitals."
13177,"According to an international agency, children of villages that have declared themselves free from open defecation are less likely to get sick and their mental and physical development is improved."
13178,"Friends, it is a case study for the top universities of the world the way Clean India Mission has reached every nook and corner of the country."
13179,The Swachhata Kranti Abhiyan is taking place at Gandhi Maidan.
13180,"Friends, Gandhi Ji had placed farmers, laborers, teachers, lawyers, doctors, engineers and everyone in the same line. Only then Satyagrah had succeeded. As a Swachchagrahi (cleanliness warriors), we should strive to spread the message of cleanliness to every section of society."
13181,The government has been promoting the Clean India Mission. There are more than 6.5 lakh Cleanliness Champions working on this mission.
13182,The work to provide housing to poor in the country has been progressing at a rapid pace under the Prime Minister's AvasYojana.
13183,"All anniversaries falling between today and the 2nd of October the next year should be marked with special motivation for the Clean India Mission. For example, tomorrow it is the birth anniversary of JyotibaPhule Ji and Baba SahebAmbedkar's birth anniversary falls on the 14th of April."
13184,"Even otherwise, let me tell you about your knowledge that the central government is going to start Gram Swaraj Abhiyan from 14th of April. "
13185,The future generations will remember your contribution in nation building.
13186,I know that this task requires extreme patience. I know that Swachchagrahis (cleanliness warriors) have a burning desire to bring about a change in the country.
13187,I am happy that India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022. The 150th anniversary of Gandhi Ji will be celebrated from the 2nd of October 2018 to the second of October 2019.
13188,"When we will move ahead with these resolves, we will be able to pay real tribute to the freedom fighters in 2022. Then we will pay tribute to Gandhi Ji, who died 150 years ago."
13189,This work is not a government event. It belongs to 1.25 billion people of the country. 
13190,With this feeling I once again honor and thank all those Swachchagrahis.
13191,Please once again join me in saying.
13192,I would say Mahatma Gandhi and you would say it twice: long live; long live.
13193,Mahatma Gandhi died.

13209,Anant Geete and Babul Thakur are present at the CPSE conclave.
13210,I congratulate the presentation team.
13211,Everyone has a part in the process of discussion and debate.
13212,The government is working to overcome the day-to-day challenges faced by you.
13213,The public sector undertakings have made significant contribution to the country's economy after independence. They helped the country to meet its economic needs.
13214,The CEO of a private company earns profit for his shareholders. The CEO of public sector enterprises earns profit on the basis of profit for their shareholders.
13215,The PSE should generate profit and social benefit for the society.
13216,The government is able to take big decisions because of your courage and hard work.
13217,In the 21st century economy Innovation and Enterprise should be the driving forces for any sector.
13218,There are no separate mantras for the success of private sector or public sector. Incentives are one of the greatest tools for bringing change in human behaviour.
13219,Incentives should be provided to employees to encourage them to work hard and contribute towards the development of the company.
13220,The first thing I have mentioned is ‘Imagination’. Several successful private companies would not have sustained for two decades if they had not been able to adapt to the upcoming changes in the future.
13221,"Thirdly, Institution building is one of the greatest tests of leadership."
13222,Till date PSEs have been classed as Navratnas. It is high time they are classified as 'New India' Ratnas.
13223,"The 5P formula is based on performance, process, persona, procurement and prepare."
13224,All institutions in India have to improve their operational and financial performance in order to compete with the world's best companies.
13225,The PSUs need to double their Net Value Addition to increase their revenue generation.
13226,Lakshmi is the materialistic substance that gives rise to industrialists. PSUs are important for the welfare of the country.
13227,The CPSE's Return on Equity is lower than the private sector.
13228,The first 'P' is 'Transactional'.
13229,The PSUs should think about how they will achieve Global greatness in the next 5 to 10 years.
13230,"It is essential for Public Sector Undertakings to be competitive in the Global scenario. European countries are doing well in the areas of power, atomic energy and solar energy. Public sector enterprises should learn from their working model."
13231,"The way the business environment has transformed globally there is a need to incorporate flexibility along with speed in decision making. In the past there have been many instances when the government Enterprises have suffered due to the lack of risk taking. Therefore, decision making should be streamlined at every level."
13232,"""We have to ensure that the right talent is being brought forward and whether we are able to create bench strength."""
13233,"In his presentation, you have mentioned about the priority given to Tech-up India mission."
13234,"The PSUs procured more than Rs.1.1, 30,000 crores in the year 2016 from the MSME sector, but only Rs. 25,000 Crores from them was from the micro, small and medium enterprises."
13235,"The government e-Market (GeM) portal instilled new energy in the MSME sector. Business worth more than Rs 6500 crore has been done on this online platform in a short time. If more people use this platform, it will bring transparency and benefit MSMEs. When people buy more items from small entrepreneurs, new opportunities for employment will open up."
13236,"The more MSMEs get involved in the development of the economy, the more they will grow."
13237,The payment to the MSMEs should not be delayed.
13238,"The manufacturing sector of the country can get a boost from Central Public Sector Enterprises. They can play a major role in rejuvenating the sectors like rural housing, renewable energy, solar energy, textile, pharma, tourism etc."
13239,I request the company to hold the annual general body meeting at a new tourist destination.
13240,"The PSUs must prepare themselves for the future in line with technological innovations such as artificial intelligence Quantum computing, electric vehicles and robotics."
13241,"New technologies such as digitisation, analytics, e-mobility and block chain are going to help you in your efforts. You can also take advantage of the new innovations in financial market and the availability of a large capital pool for investment today."
13242,"When you move ahead in harmony with the needs and priorities of the country, better results will follow."
13243,Today I will present 5 challenges as 5 questions to you in my own way. I will not get into the details.
13244,My questions are about the Indian PSUs and their work.
13245,My four questions about the CSR fund are:.
13246,Finally my fifth question: which development model will the Indian PSUs provide the nation by 2022? Will we keep on dragging the same old system or bring a new system in place?
13247,"I am putting forth challenges in the form of questions because you have to take decisions, frame policies and strategies and implement the same. When you discuss these questions in the board meetings, new pathways will open up and you will get a new direction."
13248,The prime minister asks you to contribute towards India's geo-strategic reach.
13249,It's a good opportunity to increase contact with public sector undertakings (PSUs).
13250,Today the Indian PSUs are waving their flags from Brazil to Mozambique and from Russia to Australia. They should frame a comprehensive strategy for overseas investment. The government has signed a number of MoUs with the leading cities of other countries. Can the PSUs promote Make in India in a planned and systematic manner together with the industrial bodies and Institutions of those cities?
13251,There may be 50-100 areas in which the cities can connect this way. Just signing one MoU is not enough to maximise this. There is a good opportunity for you all in this area.
13252,You can set a deadline for 2-3 years to reduce the import of any product by 10-15-20% whatever you may decide.
13253,"If we are price competitive and quality sensitive and focus on products that are imported but can be replaced by innovation, then there will be a significant reduction in the import bill."
13254,India has been one of the world's largest arms importer countries in the last 60-70 years. Foreign Direct Investment will be opened up in the defence sector.
13255,The PSUs of the defence sector should focus more on technology transfer and joint ventures to strengthen the 'Make in India' initiative.
13256,Another important aspect is the integration of innovation with research. CPSEs and the government departments need to prepare an integrated infrastructure of innovation and research by 2022.
13257,The public sector enterprises (CPSEs) made a profit of more than Rs. 1.25 trillion last year. Two per cent of this amount can be used for Corporate Social Responsibility.
13258,Donations made from the CSR fund for the construction of toilets in schools were made in 2014-15.
13259,"There are 115 districts selected by NITI Aayog as ""aspirational districts""."
13260,Your organisation can take up the task of skill development as a part of Corporate Social Responsibility.
13261,The youth will benefit from the National Apprenticeship Programme.
13262,There is a need for more incubators and tinkering labs to teach students how to develop innovative ideas.
13263,"If you all are determined, then the country can get hundreds of new model smart cities in 1-1.5 years."
13264,"Your institutions can be a role model for several areas like paperless work-culture, cashless transactions, waste management etc. with R&D."
13265,"In his message to the corporate leaders, the prime minister stressed the importance of using resources effectively."
13266,"In the last 4 years, you would not have heard a negative tone from the government."
13267,The initiative which you have taken will continue and be monitored.
13268,I am a strong believer in the power of inter-related factors.
13269,Carrying forward the dream of New India along with a new energy and feeling of service will lead the country to the path of Progress.
13270,I hope your policies regarding the country's future become successful and your participation in the accomplishment of the resolution for new India is the maximum. I would like to meet all the leaders after 100 days to learn from them.
13271,"The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, attended the CPSE Conclave at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi today."

13283,"By 2022, what will be the roadmap for Indian PSUs to optimally utilize their CSR Fund?"
13284,"By 2022, what new development model will Indian PSUs give the country?"
13285,"The Prime Minister said that out of 500 biggest companies in the world, one-fourth belong to the public sector in some country. He suggested that Indian PSUs can link with other PSUs to develop a comprehensive strategy for overseas investment and reduce India's import bill."
13286,The Prime Minister suggested that the CSR spend of CPSEs should be focused on one specific theme each year. He said one good theme could be the development of aspirational districts. CPSEs can also take up skill development programmes as part of their CSR.
13287,"The Prime Minister wants CPSEs to work as role models in many areas such as paperless work culture, cashless transactions, and waste management."
13288,The Prime Minister wants CPSEs to participate in realizing the resolve of New India.

14850,I welcome the statements by Defence Minister Shoigu and other Russian leaders in the opening session stressing Russia’s intent to explore all possible avenues for dialogue and a constructive approach to resolving differences.
14851,India and Russia have had diplomatic relations for 70 years. They have a special and privileged strategic partnership.

14856,The current deterioration of ties between Russia and the West is a reflection of the trend of increasing regional instability.
14857,"At a fundamental level, such divergent approaches indicate wider diffusion of power in the international system, in particular the rise of Asia."

14867,The scourge of terrorism remains a primary international security challenge.

14878,The UN must continue to seek inclusive frameworks for dialogue and cooperation that involve all responsible stakeholders.
14879,"India is playing an important role in maintaining regional and international peace and stability. India's continued economic rise over the past few decades has helped lift millions of its citizens out of poverty. The government is keen to enhance transparency, inclusion and growth."

15073,Long Range Forecast For 2018 Southwest Monsoon Seasonal (June-September) Rainfall
15074,Summary of the Forecast for the 2018 southwest monsoon Rainfall
15075,Monsoon seasonal rainfall is likely to be 97% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of 5%. The LPA of the season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89 cm.
15076,Forecast also suggests maximum probability for normal monsoon rainfall (96-104% of LPA) and low probability for deficient rainfall during the season.
15077,"IMD will issue an update of its forecast in early June, 2018. It will also issue separate forecasts for the monthly (July and August) and seasonal (June-September) rainfall over the four geographical regions."
15078,IMD issues operational forecast for the southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September) rainfall for the country as a whole in two stages: first stage in April and second stage in June.
15079,IMD’s SEFS model for the April forecast uses the following 5 predictors that require data upto March.
15080,Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Gradient
15081,between North Atlantic and North Pacific
15082,Northwest Europe Land Surface Air Temperature
15083,Equatorial Pacific Warm Water Volume

"

15800,The World Bank Group has a capital increase proposal for consideration in the Spring 2018.
15801,The World Bank Group has been the global leader in efforts to eliminate poverty and to bring about shared prosperity and sustainable development. It has invested over $900 billion. The ability to leverage funds on a global scale is largely dependent on the continued AAA rating of the Bank and the Preferred Creditor Status it enjoys.

15803,21. IBRD proposed a new $100 billion lending package for developing nations.
15804,"The limited lending volume and competing demands have made resource allocation among different sections of the developing world a critical element of the proposed package. The IBRD's focus on the agenda of poverty reduction, human capital formation and bridginginfrastructure gaps in lower MICs limits the funds available for development financing."
15805,The Bank will consider better options for meeting the requirement of cyclical and systemic crisis lending. It will ensure that lending volumes available to poorer countries are enhanced.
15806,"The IBRD's annual profit per share is $.24.24, compared to $7.5 billion paid in capital from all share holder members.
