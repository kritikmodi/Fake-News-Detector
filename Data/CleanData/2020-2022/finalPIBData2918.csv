228,Shri Naidu believes that history should be taught to children to enlighten and emancipate them.
229,"Even after independence, colonial tinge remained in Indian education system. The implementation of the National Education Policy should remove this."
230,The Vice President was releasing a book ‘Dhyaas Panthe Chaalta’ - a historical account of the 160 year legacy of the Maharashtra Education Society (MES) from Upa Rashtrapati Nivas today.
231,"Shri Naidu noted that the Society, established in Pune in 1860, was one of the first private educational institutions to be formed in the country, with the efforts of stalwarts such as the great “Adya Krantikarak” Shri Vasudeo Balavant Phadke, with the intention of imparting scientific education to the youth and fostering nationalist values among people."
232,"Shri Naidu paid tribute to Shri Vasudev Balwant Phadke, who fought for India's independence from British rule."
233,Maharashtra has produced leaders and organisations that laid the ideological foundations for the freedom struggle.
234,"Observing that institutions such as the Maharashtra Education Society, the Deccan Education Society and others took ‘education as a mission’, Shri Naidu called for a similar spirit now to further the cause of education."
235,"Stressing the need for a ‘21st century touch’ to the education sector, the Vice President urged an enthusiastic implementation of National Education Policy 2020 by States and educational institutions, with emphasis on interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity."
236,"Noting that the pandemic has necessitated the use of digital classrooms, smart devices and micro courses, he observed that the mode of education cannot be status quoist anymore and called upon private and public educational institutions to adopt these new hybrid standards in education."
237,"Vocational courses and distance education delivered through modern technologies can bridge geographical barriers and reach remote areas, but they must be further scaled up."
238,"Rajeev Sahasrabudhe, Chairman of Governing Body of MES, Dr. Bharat Vhankate, Secretary, MES and Shri Sudhir Gade, Assistant Secretary attended the event. Ketaki Modak is the author of the book."
239,Following is the full text of the speech:
240,Dr Ketaki Modak has released a book on the history of the Maharashtra Education Society.
241,"I am sure this book will serve as a useful reference tool for readers to trace the evolution of MES from its humble roots, while recounting various stirring anecdotes in its journey over 160 years."
242,"It is pertinent to recall that the Maharashtra Education Society was one of the first private educational institutions in Pune, established way back in 1860 with efforts of stalwarts such as the great “Adya Krantikarak” Shri Vasudeo Balavant Phadke, among others."
243,The institution was established to provide scientific education to youth and foster the values of nationalism among people.
244,"""Paramahansa Mandali"" is an organisation that promotes social reform in India."
245,The establishment of such institutions eventually led to a wave of nationalism and aroused the patriotic spirit of our great freedom fighters in the years to come.
246,"Their work in democratising education, fighting social evils and spreading scientific temper, challenging the administration on just causes and engendering social reform continued to reap benefits for the region and inspired similar movements elsewhere in the country too."
247,It is no exaggeration to say that Maharashtra was at the forefront in producing such leaders and organisations during the Indian Renaissance and laying the ideological foundations for the freedom struggle over the next century.
248,"At a time when we are honouring our national heroes through Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, we must not forget the role of these unsung leaders such as MG Ranade, Vasudev Balwant Phadke, and others."
249,"Shri Vasudev Balwant Phadke, one of the founding members of the organisation Adya Krantikarak, was a revolutionary who fought for India's independence from British rule."
250,The lives of the freedom fighters should be immortalized in school textbooks.
251,History should enlighten and emancipate us.
252,"One of the noblest aspects of institutions such as the Maharashtra Education Society, the Deccan Education Society and other such organisations is that education for them was a mission."
253,The British encouraged modern scientific education in India. They understood that it was important for industrialisation and self-respect.
254,"I am glad to know that the Maharashtra Education Society is continuing its patriotic mission even today, which is clear from the impressive list of distinguished alumni its institutions boast of."
255,"In the olden days, education was driven by the missionary spirit."
256,The National Education Policy 2020 is a futuristic document that can transform the education landscape in India.
257,The National Education Policy (NEP) is well-poised to help India reach its demographic dividend.
258,The pandemic has taught us that the mode of education cannot be status quoist. Vocational courses and distance education delivered through modern technologies can bridge geographical barriers and reach remote areas. Private and public educational institutions should adopt these new hybrid standards.
259,I am happy to have released this book today.
260,I hope this will inspire many more books on the origins of our various historical organisations.
261,"My best wishes to the Maharashtra Education Society, the publishers and the author for their future endeavours."
