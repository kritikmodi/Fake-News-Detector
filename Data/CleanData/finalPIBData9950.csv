1633,The Report confirms that climate change due to historical emissions is leading to serious impacts.

1639,The Report is a clarion call for the world to abandon their unsustainable production and consumption and move urgently to climate resilient development.
1640,The Report notes that the impacts and the consequent limitations to adaptation would rise beyond 1.5 degrees warming above pre-industrial levels. India notes that developed countries need to reduce their emissions and reach net zero by 2050.
1641,The World Bank highlights the importance of public finance.
1642,The SDGs will help improve adaptation and resilience.

1651,"India notes that future reports should strengthen the “solution space” and more comprehensively assess knowledge regarding effectiveness, costs and benefits."
1652,India firmly believes that climate change is a global collective action problem that can be solved only through international cooperation and multilateralism.
1653,"India has taken tremendous actions under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to combat climate change by taking several initiatives including, inter-alia, setting up of International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid’ and Infrastructure for Resilient Island States, raising the domestic renewable energy target to 500 GW by 2030, putting in place an ambitious National Hydrogen Mission and continuing efforts to decouple its emissions from economic growth."

6698,MAJOR FACTORS DRIVING ROPEWAY INFRASTRUCTURE
6699,Routes are economical mode of transportation.
6700,"Faster mode of transportation: Owing to the aerial mode of transportation, ropeways have an advantage over roadway projects where ropeways can be built in a straight line, over a hilly terrain."
6701,Material containers can be designed so as to exclude any soiling of the environment.
6702,Last mile connectivity: Ropeway projects adopting 3S (a kind of cable car system) or equivalent technologies can transport 6000-8000 passengers per hour.
6703,Ideal for difficult / challenging / sensitive terrain
6704,"Long rope spans: The system crosses obstacles like rivers, buildings, ravines, or roads without a problem."
6705,"Ropes guided over towers: Low space requirements on the ground, and no barrier for humans or animals."
6706,People living in difficult areas will be able to sell their produce to other areas.
6707,"Ropeway is a form of car transport. Ropeway having multiple cars propelled by a single power-plant and drive mechanism reduces both construction and maintenance costs. On level ground, ropeways are competitive with narrow-gauge railroads, but in the mountains they are far superior."
6708,Flexible: Transport of different materials - A ropeway allows for the simultaneous transport of different types of material.
6709,Ropeways and cableways can handle large slopes and large differences in elevation.
6710,"Low footprint: The fact that only narrow-based vertical supports are needed at intervals, leaving the rest of the ground free, makes it possible for ropeways to be constructed in built-up areas and in places where there is intense competition for land use."
6711,MORTH has initiated a study carried out by M/s Mckinsey & Co. for Ropeway development in the country. MORTH has signed an MoU with Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board (UTDB) for development of Ropeways in the State. DPR for Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib Ropway is in progress.
