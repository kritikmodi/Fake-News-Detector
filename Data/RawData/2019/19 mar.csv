	I have great pleasure to be here this morning to address the India-Croatia Business Forum. I would particularly like to thank Madam President for being with us today. Our joint presence underlines the commitment both countries have to deepen our economic linkages.
	I would like to thank the Croatian Chamber of Economy, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry for organizing this business event. I am happy at the enthusiastic turnout from both countries; some 30 companies have travelled from India to participate in this Forum.  


Ladies and Gentlemen,


	I had productive discussions yesterday with Madam President and with Prime Minister Plenkovic on how to take forward our multi-faceted bilateral ties. There is immense potential to expand trade and investment profile and establish innovation, research and start-up partnerships. Add to this, we have a rich trading past to encourage and inspire us! Many here would know of the flourishing mercantile connect between Dubrovnik and Goa that existed in the 16th century. Over 1000 Croatian traders lived in Goa shipping merchandise across continents and oceans. The church of Saint Blaise in Goa, a replica of the original in Dubrovnik, stands testimony to their enterprise and prosperity. 
	There are still other compelling factors enriching the India-Croatia business ecosystem. Croatia’s popularity in India has increased manifold following Croatian team’s outstanding performance in the FIFA World Cup last year. Croatia’s natural beauty and friendliness are attractions no less, and Indian tourists have started to visit this beautiful country in large numbers. These exchanges and understanding would be most helpful for enhancing two-way business collaborations.  


Ladies and Gentlemen,


	India is known as the land of culture and spiritualism in Croatia.  That may well be the case, but you need to experience the economic energy, dynamism and vigour of the new India in the making. The world is taking note of it and so must you. India today is the fastest growing major economy in the world with a growth of over 7%. Presently, it is the 3rd largest economy in the world in purchasing power terms and the 6th largest in absolute terms. And it is poised to be a 5 trillion-dollar economy by 2025. You will find in India a transformed business climate today, a good measure of which is India’s extraordinary jump of 65 places during the last four years in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index. The introduction of the path-breaking Goods and Services Tax has transformed India, a country of 1.3 billion people, into One Nation, One Tax, and One Market for the first time in her history. 
	And with growth, we are combining equity, to empower women and to allow those at the bottom of the pyramid a stake in progress and prosperity. Our financial inclusion programme - Jan Dhan Yojana - has seen over 330 million bank accounts opened for the poor and the needy. The largest public health insurance scheme in the world, Ayushman Bharat, has been rolled out with enormous success.
	We are also at work to tailor our reforms to realize the full potential of our youth. India enjoys a uniquely favourable demography with nearly half of our population below the age of 25 years. Our Skill India and Start-up India programmes are unleashing a new wave of entrepreneurship and enterprise. India has the second largest network of start-ups in the world with one of the highest numbers of unicorn success. 
	India is known for its software prowess. Work is now underway to upgrade the “hardware” of our nation through next-generation infrastructure, be it the 100 Smart cities, high-speed train corridors, airports, highways, or nationwide broadband connectivity. 


Ladies and Gentlemen, 


	India is changing and changing fast. The international business community has given a vote of confidence to these changes with new investments. During our last financial year, we received US$ 62 billion in foreign direct investment. Indian industry is also reaching out across the world, be it through trade, direct investments or joint collaborations. But numbers often don’t capture the enormous changes taking place or the dynamism that accompanies them. I invite you to come and experience for yourself what we are doing for ourselves and for the world.  We invite Croatia to partner with us and take advantage of the opportunities that India presents. 
	I am encouraged that bilateral trade has doubled during the last decade, and some investments have been made in both directions. However, you would admit that our bilateral trade and investment flows are still modest. For Croatia, the Indian growth story presents opportunities for two-way engagement in information technology, pharmaceuticals, digital economy, renewable energy, healthcare, infrastructure, defence and tourism sectors, just to name a few.
	We would like Croatia to collaborate with us in our flagship programmes - Make in India, Clean India, Start-up India and Digital India. We are also keen to learn from Croatia in the tourism and urban infrastructure sectors.
	Indian IT sector has much to offer to Croatia. One of our largest IT companies, Infosys, is already present in Croatia, as is a large pharmaceutical company, the ACG Group. The Indian pharmaceuticals industry is the third largest in the world in terms of volume and the world’s largest provider of generic drugs. They can partner Croatia in providing quality healthcare, medicines and medical devices for the public health system at an affordable cost. There are prospects for promoting medical and wellness tourism as well.   
	Defence sector could be a vital area of cooperation between our two countries. Our defence requirements are huge and I invite Croatian companies to partner us in meeting our demands. There are opportunities in the renewable energy sector as well. In India, we have set a target to reach renewable energy generation capacity of 175 Gigawatts, including 100 Gigawatts of solar by 2022. I am told that an Indian company, Green Orient Power, has invested in wind farms near Sibenik. Entertainment is another growing area of economic engagement.  A number of Indian filmmakers are now showing interest to shoot in this beautiful country.  
	The services sector contributes significantly to the economies of both India and Croatia. We must look at ways to enhance cooperation in this field. India can also be a partner in Croatia’s development by providing skilled manpower in information technology, construction, hospitality and health sectors.


Ladies and gentlemen,


	There is lot more to happen in our bilateral economic relations. I invite Indian and Croatian businesses to partner with each other for trade, technology and investment collaboration. In today’s globalized world, we cannot think only in terms of export and import, we must also look at integrating our value and supply chains to derive maximum benefit. I am happy that an India-Croatia Business Council has been set in place. We need to energize it and seek its assistance in identifying new areas of cooperation. As Governments, we can be the facilitators for business but you are the true spearheads of greater economic engagement. I wish you the very best in this endeavor. 
	I once again thank all the stakeholders for making today’s forum a success. And convey my deep appreciation for the esteemed presence of Madam President and her commitment to promote India-Croatia business ties. 


Thank you!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the Croatian-Indian Economic Forum in Zagreb, Croatia today (March 27, 2019).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India is known as the land of culture and spiritualism in Croatia. That may well be the case, but Croatian people need to experience the economic energy, dynamism and vigour of the new India in the making. India is changing and changing fast. The international business community has given a vote of confidence to these changes with new investments. During our last financial year, we received US$ 62 billion in foreign direct investment. Indian industry is also reaching out across the world, be it through trade, direct investments or joint collaborations. But numbers often don’t capture the enormous changes taking place or the dynamism that accompanies them. He invited Croatia to partner with India and take advantage of the opportunities that India presents.

The President said that in today’s globalized world, we cannot think only in terms of export and import, we must also look at integrating our value and supply chains to derive maximum benefit. He was happy to note that an India-Croatia Business Council has been set in place. He said that we need to energize it and seek its assistance in identifying new areas of cooperation. As Governments, we can be the facilitators for business but business communities are the true spearheads of greater economic engagement. He invited Indian and Croatian businesses to partner with each other for trade, technology and investment collaboration.

Later today, the President addressed the students of the University of Zagreb. The theme of the address was “India – Croatia relations- the way forward”.

Addressing the gathering, the President said that the University of Zagreb is renowned as a centre for learning and scholarship. We in India have a special connect with this university, and particularly its Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, for hosting the Department of Indology.

The President said that Croatia’s progress to a stable and prosperous democracy is indeed inspirational. Its journey as a member of the European Union, a key global partner for India, heralds a new beginning for Croatia. All of us would do well with a stronger Europe, one that should continue to anchor a multi-polar world uplifting multilateralism, strengthening global governance and ensuring adherence to international laws and regulations. 

The President said that India now have the third largest scientific and technical manpower pool in the world, with 162 universities awarding over 4000 doctorates annually. India’s skill in information technology is well known. India has a thriving research and development services market, which is expected to reach US$ 38 billion by 2020. A third of the top 1000 companies in terms of global research and development spending, now have centres in India. The knowledge economy wrapped around the digital highway and powered by artificial intelligence has immense scope to bring our research-labs together, to bring our entrepreneurs together, and to bring new solutions for health and well-being for our people.

The President said that there is much India-Croatia can do together. He said that the two countries have to now build a new-age partnership, a partnership anchored in economic synergies, in geo-political realities, in technology and innovation, in sustainability and the 4th Industrial Revolution, and in the strengths and priorities of the two countries. 

The President said that his visit was the first by a President of India to Croatia. His visit intends to reaffirm India’s hand of friendship and to invite Croatians, particularly its youth, to venture out to India.

The President will leave for Bolivia – the second leg of his visit tomorrow morning (March 28, 2019).

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the Indian community and Friends of India in Zagreb, Croatia, yesterday evening (March 26, 2019) at a Reception hosted by Shri Arindam Bagchi, Ambassador of India to Croatia.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that it is very heartening to see that irrespective of their background, Indian community had found a welcoming home in Croatia, and is contributing in its own ways to the development of Croatia. Yet, the members of the community have kept India and Indian values and traditions alive in their hearts and they were a true reflection of India with its rich diversity, cultural heritage and traditions.

The President said that Indian diaspora are the prism through which the Croatian people see India, and their success in Croatia has contributed to building a positive image of India in this country. He also thanked the friendly people of Croatia for their generosity and large heartedness in welcoming Indian community in their homes, and in their social circles. He said that the role that each one of them has played in enhancing engagement and understanding between India and Croatia is truly commendable.

The President said that the values of democracy, pluralism and peace that India stands for, and its economic growth story, have combined to make India a force to be reckoned with. He said that India was ready to work with everyone to find solutions to global challenges and to extend a hand of friendship to one and all.

The President appreciated the role played by Friends of India, a large number of whom attended the event, in enhancing engagement and understanding between India and Croatia. He appreciated their efforts in creating a vast network of cultural institutions, dance and yoga schools, Ayurveda clinics and Indian stores and restaurants. All these have popularized India across Croatia and across all age groups. We were truly impressed that International Day of Yoga was celebrated last year in 37 cities across Croatia, he said.

The President also attended a banquet yesterday (March 26, 2019) hosted in his honour by the President of Croatia, Mrs Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India and Croatia enjoy historical and cultural linkages. The Independence of Croatia coincided with a new phase of liberalization of Indian economy. The growth story of India, particularly over the last few years, and Croatian journey as a member country of the European Union, hold immense promise for our economic partnership.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reached Zagreb, Croatia yesterday (March 25, 2019) on the first leg of his state visit to three nations – Croatia, Bolivia and Chile. This is the first-ever visit of a head of state from India to Croatia.  

Today (March 26, 2019), the President commenced his engagements with visit to the Office of the President of Croatia where he was received by his counterpart, Mrs Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic and accorded a ceremonial welcome. 

During the subsequent one-to-one discussions with President Kitarovic, the President said that he was honoured to pay the first-ever State Visit from India to Croatia. He thanked her for the warm hospitality accorded to him and his delegation. Thereafter, the President was conferred the Grand Order of the King of Tomislav, the highest award of the Republic of Croatia. He dedicated the award to India-Croatia Friendship. 

Subsequently, the President led delegation-level talks between the two sides. Speaking on the occasion, he said that India looks forward to greater cooperation with Croatia, both bilaterally and within the architecture of the European Union, particularly during Croatia’s Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2020.  The President said that India has strategic partnership with the European Union. India is working towards finalizing a pragmatic and balanced India-EU Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement. We would seek Croatia’s support for this, particularly during its Presidency of the EU. 

The President said that India is keen to impart greater economic content to its bilateral relations with Croatia. India-Croatia bilateral trade has doubled over the last decade but it does not reflect the true potential as yet. There are a number of new sectors that hold promise for both sides such as pharma, waste management, infrastructure development, agriculture, biomedical research and start-ups.  

The President also offered to gift a bust of Mahatma Gandhi to Croatia to mark his 150th Birth Anniversary. The President of Croatia expressed her thanks for the gesture and assured that all efforts would be made to place the bust at a prominent public place in Croatia and unveil the same on October 2, 2019. 

On talks concerning multilateral issues, Croatia expressed support for UN reforms including permanent membership for India in an expanded and reformed UN Security Council. 

The President also emphasised India’s commitment to the cause of mitigating climate change and welcomed Croatia to join the International Solar Alliance. The Croatian President assured that Croatia would consider India’s invitation with full earnestness. On the issue of terrorism, both countries agreed to work together to develop a strong global response to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and to seek accountability and action from those responsible for such barbaric acts. 

Following the delegation-level talks, the two Presidents witnessed the signing and exchange of four MOUs that concern fields of tourism, sports and culture. These include: 

1.   An MOU on Hindi Chair: India (ICCR) to continue the Hindi Chair at Indology Department of University of Zagreb for another three years.

2.   An MOU on Sanskrit Chair: Given the interest shown by Croatians in studying Sanskrit, India (ICCR) to set up a Sanskrit Chair at the Indology Department of University of Zagreb.

3.   An MOU on cooperation in the field of tourism: this will help deepen links between the two countries in this tourism sector.

4.   An MOU in field of sports: for cooperation between the Sports Authority of India and the Department of Kinesiology of the University of Zagreb for taking up joint initiatives for capacity building in sports. 

The President also issued a Press Statement on his visit to Croatia (attached).  

Later, the President visited the Mirogoj City Cemetery and paid his respects at the “Voice of the Croatian Victims-Wall of Pain Memorial”. 

In his next engagement, the President visited the State Residence Visoka where the Prime Minister of Croatia, Mr Andrej Plenkovic, received him and hosted a working lunch. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India-Croatia relations go deep into history. Since Croatian Independence, our two countries have had close and friendly relations.  We are keen to deepen our bilateral ties and expand their scope.  

The President said that terrorism is a global threat which requires global response. The recent Pulwana terrorist attack on Indian security personnel is again an acute reminder of the urgency of determined international efforts to curb this menace.  India had made a proposal for a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the United Nations to strengthen international laws on counter terrorism. He sought Croatia’s support for early finalization of the Convention.

 Later in the evening, the President will address an Indian Community Reception in Zagreb. He will also attend a banquet hosted in his honour by the President of Croatia.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, in his message on the eve of World Tuberculosis Day, which is observed every year on March 24, has said:-

“I am happy to note that World Tuberculosis Day is observed every year on 24th March, to commemorate the anniversary of Dr. Robert Koch’s discovery of the Tuberculosis (TB) bacteria in 1882.

The theme of World Tuberculosis Day this year is “It’s Time”. Consistent with the spirit of this theme, India has renewed its commitments and intentions to end TB by 2025, five years ahead of the global targets. This is an ambitious timeline and, given our motivation to eliminate the disease, it is achievable.

I urge all stakeholders to come together to achieve a TB free India. Let us re-dedicate ourselves towards achieving this goal”.

	I welcome officer trainees of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service and of the Central Engineering Services (Roads) to Rashtrapati Bhavan. I must make special mention of the two Audit and Accounts officer trainees from Bhutan. You come from a country which is a very dear friend for us in India. I congratulate each of you for your success in a rigorous and competitive examination and selection process – and for having opted for a career with the government. This is not just a career; it is a calling – a service to the people.
	The IAAS is a much respected institution in our country. It has a legacy going back over 150 years. Through this period, the economy has changed, technology has changed, accounting practices have changed – but the philosophy and principles of the IAAS have remained the same: to impart public service for the benefit of our nation and our people. 



	IAAS officers play a critical role in ensuring the accountability of the executive to the legislature. The reports of the CAG, submitted to the legislature, play a pivotal part in enforcing this accountability. The audit report is a crucial input for parliamentary committees such as the Public Accounts Committee and Committee on Public Undertakings for holding public functionaries to account, in judging their performance and recommending improvements. 



	As officers of the IAAS you are guardians of public trust and financial prudence. Always bear in mind that the objective of an audit should be to improve governance strategies. The credibility of your findings will determine the utility of the audit for enhancing the quality of governance. While you are indeed watchdogs, it is also important that your approach is not simply fault finding but is constructive and aimed at solving the problems at hand. Integrity is nonnegotiable – but it can and must coexist with an enlightened approach and genuine problem solving.
	The Central Engineering Services (Roads) is an important contributor to what is one of the most exciting phases of road and highway development in Indian history. In recent years, there has been a rapid rollout of roads in our cities and rural areas, between our cities in the form of national highways, and – most satisfyingly – in remote and border areas. You are part of India’s connectivity revolution.
	The challenge now is not just to build more but to build better and to build safer. As engineers working on road and highway projects, please be mindful that you are building not just for the next journey – but for the next generation. Use of new technologies to make roads more durable and cost-effective in the long run should be a key determining factor while designing projects. As India has shown, using plastic waste for road building can not only make the surface stronger, it can also help in recycling. This is only one example. The coming years will offer many such opportunities. Please be alive to them.
	As automobile traffic in India increases, as more two-wheelers and cars and commercial vehicles drive onto our roads and highways, issues of speed and safety also arise. The number of traffic accidents and deaths in India is far too high for comfort. I appreciate that the solution does not lie with engineers alone, but I would urge you to be mindful of this problem and try to minimise if not entirely eliminate road tragedies in India.
	As I conclude, I don’t have to remind you that as public servants, you are expected to serve the nation and fellow citizens with courage of conviction and devotion to duty. While discharging your duty, you must maintain the highest standards of integrity and discipline – and I am confident you will do so. I wish you every success.


Thank you

Jai Hind!

	I am very happy to be here with all of you at FINE 2019 – the Festival of Innovation and Entrepreneurship. This Festival is a celebration of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship. Till 2018, it had been hosted at Rashtrapati Bhavan. This year it was decided to organise it outside Rashtrapati Bhavan. Earlier people used to come to the Festival, this year the Festival has come to the people. And indeed I am glad that this Festival is being organised here in Gujarat for two reasons. Firstly, Gujarat is known as a land of innovation and entrepreneurship. And secondly, this Festival is being held here during the year in which we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of perhaps the greatest Gujarati of all time, the Father of our Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. 


 


	Gandhiji strongly advocated finding local solutions to local problems. This thought was inherent in his idea of Gram Swaraj. It is a matter of immense satisfaction that this Festival sees participation from several grassroots innovators who have been inspired to find effective solutions to problems that they experienced in their communities. I congratulate all the award winners. I hope they will continue to be an inspiration for society. The creativity and efforts they have put in to conceive practical solutions to everyday problems is commendable. 


 


	Participants at this Festival come from different parts of India. Clearly, the spirit of innovation is noticeable all across our country. This is a welcome trend and I commend the National Innovation Foundation for organising this Festival that provides innovators from across the country an opportunity to share their experiences and exchange ideas. 


 


	The National Innovation Foundation was established in year 2000, with the assistance of Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. Ever since, it has made a big contribution to strengthen the grassroots technological innovations and outstanding traditional knowledge in the country. I am happy to learn that NIF has created a huge database of ideas, innovations and traditional knowledge practices from all over the country. It has recognised over 800 grassroots innovators through awards. And, it has had hundred of innovations validated through our institutions. Furthermore, the NIF has dozens of patents, design registrations and trademark applications. The support that NIF has extended to the grassroots innovators is laudable and so have been the accomplishments of innovators themselves. 


 


	A reflection of this good work is seen in the fact that three innovators who were incubated by NIF have been selected for the Padma Shri this year. These innovators are Shri Jagdish Prasad Parikh who developed a new variety of cauliflower, Shri Uddhab Kumar Bharali who developed a Pomegranate Deseeder, Arecanut peeler and a Bamboo splitting machine, and Shri Vallabhbhai Vasrambhai Marvaniya who developed an improved carrot variety. I am told that thousands of farmers and citizens have benefited from their innovations. Incidentally, like some of you got the awards today, these three innovators had also received the Biennial National Grassroots Innovation Award in past. In fact, NIF’s award was the first recognition for their innovations. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	As we seek to meet important developmental goals and build a caring, inclusive and happy society, we have to draw upon the power of innovation to find solutions to our concerns in diverse domains such as health, education, food security, energy access, environmental protection, and national security. We have to make all efforts to promote an innovation culture and become an innovation society. This will provide us the best possibility of ensuring that every young Indian will have an opportunity to realise his or her true potential. In the wider sense, an innovation culture can be a catalyst to help us reach our goals as a society and as a nation. 


 


	To usher in such a culture calls for revitalising every link in the innovation value chain. We need schools where children tinker rather than only memorise. We need work cultures where young talent looks up and questions – rather than looks down and nods. And of course the government will continue to provide a facilitative environment.


 


	However, an innovative idea in itself is not enough. It is important to ensure that a creative idea gets the support it needs for its maturing, diffusion and delivery on the ground. Innovation itself is only the first of two key drivers to ensure that any innovation becomes actionable. The second key driver is entrepreneurship, which needs to supplement innovation so as to deliver benefits to our fellow citizens.


 


	We need to build an ecosystem for converting innovations into enterprises. These could be commercial or social enterprises; the form does not matter as long as the enterprise enables an innovation to actually make an impact. This necessarily requires support for start-ups and for incubating young innovators. It is critical to connect all the links of incubating innovations into enterprises by providing financial, mentoring and policy support. 


 


	To be sure, NIF has done just this in many specific cases. But, my suggestion, for the consideration of all present here is to see if we can scale up the impact of our innovations to national and perhaps even global levels. While we are good at supporting the curation of ideas and their mentoring at early stages, we need to strengthen our capacities to connect science, technology and innovation on the one hand with market, commercial success and public good on the other. Such capacity augmentation could be based on active collaboration among institutions, each with expertise in a relevant domain.   


 


	By doing so, thousands of innovative ideas that come up can be examined to identify those which could be scaled up for the market, in order to maximize their social and economic benefits.  When an innovation matures into an enterprise it not only takes the innovation’s benefits to more people but it also leads to creation of both direct and indirect employment. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	I am told that during FINE 2019 five roundtables will be organised that will discuss issues such as scaling up and commercialisation of innovations, leveraging innovative technologies for affordable healthcare, balanced nutrition and inclusive development and transforming waste into useful products for wealth creation. Each of these issues is very relevant and important. I am confident that intense and engaging discussions will be held by specialists in each of the roundtables – and will result in concrete recommendations and action points.  


 


	I compliment the NIF and the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India for their efforts in organising this Festival. By bringing FINE 2019 to Gandhinagar, a larger set of people will get exposure to the discourse and discussions that shape this Festival. No doubt the people of Gujarat, who have been innovative in themselves and in so many different ways, will also draw value from the Festival. 


 


	As I conclude, I congratulate all the innovators, whether from the informal or formal sector, the scientists, students, teachers, mentors, policy makers, government officials, friends from industry and academia, and members of the public, for their enthusiastic participation in this Festival. I am sure there will be several takeaways for each one of you. I would like to mention one such takeaway for all of you. That is, the need for us to ensure that innovative ideas mature into sustainable enterprises in order to maximise the innovation’s benefit to society and the nation. May every innovation inspire another – and may the innovation journey continue!


 

Thank you,

Jai Hind!

                Officer Trainees of the 72nd batch of the Indian Revenue Service called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (March 8, 2019) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 

Addressing the IRS Officer Trainees, the President said that India is the world’s fastest growing major economy. Over the coming decade, its GDP is expected to more than double. This will create more opportunities all-round. It will increase tax revenues and enhance challenges for Revenue Officers. They will need to address the challenges while facilitating the economic engine of our country.

 

The President said that in recent years the government has taken several initiatives to clean our financial system and defeat the menace of black money. IRS officers are frontline soldiers in this battle. Steps such as demonetisation, the Income Declaration Scheme, and amendment to the Benami Transactions Prohibition Act have demonstrated the will of the people and the government to make our economy more transparent.

 

The President said that common people have great expectations from our public servants and particularly from the IRS officers. They are one of the most important interfaces between the government and citizens. He advised them to never forget that it is from “We, the People” that they derive their power and authority to serve the very same people – the people of India.

“On International Women’s Day, I extend my warm greetings to all fellow citizens and particularly to the daughters of India who, through their success, have brought glory to the nation. We are proud of them.

This day is dedicated to woman power. Keeping pace with the changing times, women have proved themselves in every sphere of life and have won laurels for their talent. I am confident that Indian society will continue progressing towards greater women’s empowerment and the continuous emphasis on gender equity will usher in new opportunities for women and for society.

I extend my best wishes to all on this happy day.”

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the Swachh Survekshan Awards 2019, an initiative of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India, at a function held in New Delhi today (March 6, 2019).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India has made remarkable progress towards achieving the goals of rural and urban sanitation.  Today, a city or village is identified by its emphasis on cleanliness. This is an important change. By winning the first prize in all the four surveys so far, Indore has set an example for other urban centres.

The President said that cleanliness should be integral to the behaviour of every citizen to make it effective and sustainable. Many people pay attention to personal hygiene but remain apathetic to public and community cleanliness. Change in this mentality is important for achieving the goals of Swachh Bharat. He urged educational institutions to include cleanliness in their curriculum and spread awareness about the importance of sanitation.

	I am happy to be here today at Air Force Station Sulur to award Colours to Air Force Station Hakimpet and 5 Base Repair Depot.


 


	Both these stations have a rich history of professional excellence and have served the Nation with honour and distinction in peace and during hostilities. The Nation honours them today with a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation for their selfless devotion, professionalism and courage in the face of adversity. 


 


	India’s growing stature in the comity of nations is consistent with the strength and capabilities of our armed forces. India remains firmly committed to peace, but in case the need arises, we will use all our might to protect the nation’s sovereignty. I am confident that our valiant men and women in uniform will rise to the occasion. Our Armed Forces, exemplified by the air warriors who stand before us, reflect our firm resolve to defend our nation. Their valour and professionalism was on display very recently, as the Indian Air Force carried out pre-emptive strikes on a known terrorist camp.


 


	The Indian Air Force has over the years grown into a modern, technology-intensive force distinguished by its commitment to excellence and professionalism. Keeping pace with the demands of contemporary advancements, the Indian Air Force continues to modernize in a rapid manner and is in the process of a very comprehensive modernisation plan. Besides safeguarding the sovereign skies of our nation, the Indian Air Force has also been at the forefront of all Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief operations. The resilience and tenacity displayed by our valiant air warriors is a great source of pride for the Nation. 


 


	Keeping our aircrafts air worthy is a crucial task. In this regard, 5 Base Repair Depot has been repairing and overhauling the Kiran, Avro and Dornier aircraft, many of which are maintained airworthy even after 30 years.  Numerous unique indigenisation measures adopted by this Base Repair Depot to promote self reliance, have effectively contributed towards enhancing the organisational potential. 5 Base Repair Depot has truly epitomised its motto ‘Kaya Kalpa’ with continuous rejuvenation through infusion of new ideas, innovations and technological developments. The Base Repair Depot’s efforts to promote indigenous design and development of defence equipment for achieving substantive self-reliance under the ‘Make in India’ initiative are praiseworthy.


 


	Air Force Station Hakimpet has served the Nation with distinction. The station has been imparting quality training to pilots of the Indian Air Force. The strong foundation gained by the pilots facilitated their successful further graduation to higher performance aircraft.  During the wars of 1965 and 1971, the flying instructors and technical personnel of the station joined operational unit and served with remarkable courage and professionalism. 


 


	It is also to the credit of Air Force Station Hakimpet for having commenced flying training for lady pilots in Helicopter Stream in 1995 and on Fighter Stream in 2016. The station personnel have also been involved in various Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief operations. 


 


	In acknowledgement and recognition of their outstanding performance, I am pleased to award Colours to Air Force Station
	Hakimpet and 5 Base Repair Depot. I take the opportunity to compliment the personnel and families of both the stations, past and present, for their selfless sacrifice and service to the Nation.
	The Nation is indeed proud of you. I wish you and your families the very best and a glorious future.


 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for concerted efforts to eliminate the menace of terrorism, tackle climate change, remove social inequalities, alleviate poverty and minimize the urban rural divide to build a peaceful, harmonious and happy nation.

Speaking at a felicitation function organized by the Vice President’s friends and well wishers in Visakhapatanam today following the recent conferment of Doctor Honoris Causa upon him by the Peace University of Costa Rica in recognition of his contribution to the rule of law, democracy, sustainable development and peace, he emphasized that Peace was prerequisite for progress of any nation. Any kind of conflict or strife would prevent developmental prospects of the region. “One cannot pay attention to development if there is tension”, he added.

Shri Naidu said that it was the duty of every citizen to ensure that the social harmony in our country was not disturbed in any way. He called upon the media to conduct a performance audit of parties and candidates and place a progress report before the people to enable them make an informed choice. He said the people too must seek accountability and performance reports from candidates and the parties.

Referring to the trend of politicians switching parties, the Vice President said that such people must resign to their posts before seeking re-election.  

Referring to the importance of the electoral process in strengthening democracy, he said that people should elect representatives who possess Character, Caliber, Capacity and good Conduct. Asking people to exercise their franchise, the Shri Naidu said that vote was not just a right but a responsibility bestowed upon the citizenry by the framers of the constitution.

The Vice President said that India has always been a proponent of peace and believed in the philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” which treats entire world as one family. He said that India, being a votary of peace and non-violence from time immemorial, always wishes to have cordial relations with all countries and peoples around the world.

Referring to the Honorary Doctorate conferred upon him, the Vice President said the honour was not for an individual but a reflection of the global acknowledgement and recognition of the age-old values of peace and harmony embedded in Indian philosophy.  

Observing that he felt doubly honored to have received the Honorary Doctorate at a time when the world is commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi ji, who had demonstrated to the world the power of non-violence, he emphasized that peace was the prerequisite for progress of any nation.Any kind of conflict or strife would prevent developmental prospects of the region. 

Saying that India has been a victim of the menace of cross-border terrorism, the Vice President said that Terrorism could never be treated with kid gloves. He asked the world community to come together to ‘fight out and root out’ terror. 

Shri Naidu said that the United Nations must conclude at the earliest the deliberations on the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism proposed by India and take action against those promoting terror. ‘We need to name & shame those who promote terror as a state policy and cut their aid, he added.

The Vice President also urged every citizen to strive to protect the environment, reduce pollution, promote greenery, conserve water bodies and ensure that development does not disrupt natural resources.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said it was time for the education system to be re-oriented by moving away from the colonial mindset. He said that a nation that does not derive inspiration and energy from its history would find it very difficult to meet with the challenges of the future.

 

“We must teach history in an objective manner as it actually unfolded”, he said, while delivering the Third Convocation address of IIM Visakhapatnam today.

 

Stressing that education was not just for employment, the Vice President said that education must empower an individual with knowledge and wisdom.

 

The Vice President opined that access to quality education for all and at all levels was essential to ensure inclusive growth and prevent any form of discrimination. He advised students to update their knowledge and skills with the changing needs of the 21st century global job market.

 

“New knowledge transforms old paradigms. You can and you should keep yourself ahead in this knowledge revolution,” he said. 

 

Shri Naidu said that the time has arrived for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub and for that to happen, he opined that the seats of learning, especially the universities, must reinvent themselves as hubs of vibrant intellectual pursuit and as centres of resolute research and innovation.

 

Talking about the importance of agriculture in the growth of a nation, the Vice President said that revitalizing and rejuvenating agriculture was of utmost important. He said that one should not hesitate to introduce a number of structural changes in agricultural sector to make it profitable.

 

Shri Naidu also called for united efforts from the government, scientists, agriculture research institutes and farmers to work in unison to ensure food security with home-grown nutritious food. “I have always maintained that India cannot survive on imported food security,” he said. 

 

The Vice President lauded IIM Visakhapatnam for mentoring and guiding about 25 aspiring women entrepreneurs from AP and Telangana. He said that such initiatives of women empowerment would act as a force-multiplier and transform families, economy and the society at large.

 

The Chairperson, Board of Governors, IIM, Shri Hari S. Bhatia, the Director, IIM, Vishakhapatanam, Prof. M. Chandrashekhar, faculty and students of the institute were present at the venue. 

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 


""I am always happy to be in Visakhapatnam, especially on an occasion as special as this one. 

 

It’s here in Andhra University that I studied law and had my initiation to public life. The hallowed precincts of Andhra University and the fresh-breeze of this beautiful city energize me and bring me countless wonderful memories, every time I visit. 

 

I recall with great fondness my taking part in the Foundation Stone Laying Function for the permanent campus of this Institute on 17 Jan. 2015.  I do look forward to the day in 2021, when IIM-V would be operating from its sylvan campus in wholesome surroundings, scaling up its activity-profile in scope, spread and specialization.

 

I am happy to see that this nascent Institute is already being acknowledged as being at the forefront of performance among the all the seven new- generation IIMs set up around 2015. 

 

I compliment the Board, the Director and the entire Institute for the high accomplishments and also congratulate the teachers and students. 

 

My special praise to the graduates and medal winners who have lived up to the expectations of their parents, teachers, elders and well-wishers. 

 

Dear students,

 

The real life-journey starts now. All that you have learnt in this institution will provide you the basic tools for your individual and professional growth. It depends upon you as to how you go on adding to this pool of knowledge. You must constantly update your knowledge and skills because the world of work is constantly changing. New skills sets become essential. New knowledge transforms old paradigms. You can and you should keep yourself ahead in this knowledge revolution. 

 

Let me remind you that your success will depend on number of factors but will essentially depend on your competence and humility to realize that there is so much to learn. This is what the ancient Indian text ‘Hithopodesam’ has to say about an educated person:  

 

Vidya dadaathi vinayam

Vinayaad yati paatrataam 
Paatratvaad dhanam aapnoti, 

Dhanaad dharmam tatah sukham

 

True education gives us humility to become lifelong learners. With constant learning, we constantly upgrade our competence. 

 

It is time that we re-orient our education system by moving away from the colonial mindset. For a long time we have been teaching History from a colonial point of view. 

 

I strongly believe that a nation that does not derive inspiration and energy from its history will find it very difficult to meet with the challenges of the future. India has a glorious history, a splendid past that we can all be proud of and rejoice about. We therefore must teach history in an objective manner as it actually unfolded.

 

My dear young friends, 

 

Let me impress upon you that education is not only for employment. Education should empower the individual with knowledge and wisdom. Access to quality education for all and at all levels is equally essential to ensure inclusive growth and prevent any kind of discrimination.

 

Time has come for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub, he said. For that to happen, the seats of learning, especially the universities, must reinvent themselves as hubs of vibrant intellectual pursuit and as centres of resolute research and innovation.

 

Education is not only for employment. It should empower the individual with knowledge and wisdom to sift the wheat from the chaff. Access to quality education for all and at all levels is equally essential to ensure inclusive growth and prevent any kind of discrimination.

Time has come for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub, For that to happen, the seats of learning, especially the universities, must reinvent themselves as hubs of vibrant intellectual pursuit.

As we become more competent, we access better livelihood opportunities and acquire wealth. If we can then have the wisdom to share our prosperity with others, we get tremendous satisfaction. That is  true joy. What one needs is to develop competence as well as  ethical conduct, unwavering commitment and confidence borne out of ceaseless quest for knowledge.

My dear young students,

I urge you to be bold and think out of the box.  Some of you should choose the path of experimentation and entrepreneurship. There could be no better place than India of today for this experimentation.

It’s heartening to learn from the recent NASSCOM Summit (National Association of Software & Service Companies) that India has the 3rd largest Start-up Eco-system in the world (behind USA and UK), with 7,700 companies (including 1200 in technology domains).

India today boasts of 18 Unicorns, companies valued at more than 1 Billion USD. 1200 start-ups and 8 Unicorns have joined the club in 2018, the highest ever, in just one year

What is amazing is that more than 40% of the new start-ups are being formed outside the metro regions i.e. in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, including Vishakhapatnam.

Another distinguishing feature of this aspect has been the rise in the number of women entrepreneurs in these start-ups, to 14% from 10% over the previous two years.

The Indian Start-up Ecosystem has led to the creation of 40,000 new direct jobs, while indirect jobs are estimated at a dozen times that number. The total employee base in the Indian ecosystem today is estimated at about 1.7 lakh.

Reflecting this trend is the phenomenal growth of our MSME Sector. The Ministry’s 2017-18 Annual Report says, MSMEs are contributing to 29% of GDP. More than 20% of the total units are owned by women.

We must also strive to revitalize and rejuvenate our agriculture.

I have always maintained that India cannot survive on imported food security. While it accounts for less than a fifth of the GDP, agriculture still remains the main source of employment for nearly half of India’s labour force

To improve labour productivity in agriculture, we need greater on-farm value addition/agro-processing and innovative institutional arrangements in the sector which will improve the bargaining strength of farmers in the market.

We must not hesitate to introduce a number of structural changes in our agricultural sector to make it profitable.

However, our biggest strength lies in our our demographic advantage. With 65% of the population below 35 years of age, we cannot be any better placed in terms of available talent-pool. We must enrich this human capital and realize the demographic dividend

Institutions like IIM-V have a major role to play in this transformation

I am pleased to know in this context that IIM Visakhapatnam is mentoring and guiding about 25 aspiring women entrepreneurs, 17 from AP and 8 from Telangana, notwithstanding their socio-economic status; literacy or knowledge levels; and helping them convert their dreams into deeds. 

I hear that the results are extremely encouraging. 

Women’s empowerment is a force-multiplier.

It transforms families, economy and the society at large. I look forward to IIMV emerging as a major hub for incubation; entrepreneurial-learning and development in the times to come, with special attention paid to women’s empowerment. Of course, there is a long-way to go. 

In India, there are about 8 Million women entrepreneurs out of a total of 59 Million, or about 14%. This needs to go up substantially. 

Swami Vivekananda had said: “There is no chance for the welfare of the world, unless the condition of women is improved.

Institutions like IIM-V should provide a platform for knowledge-transfer, experience-sharing, original research  and innovation. 

As Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar had said, “An idea needs propagation as much as a plant needs watering.  Otherwise, both will wither and die”.  I am therefore glad that the Institute is nurturing talent and fostering excellence with a clear focus on social equity and gender sensitivity. 

Albert Einstein  had said: “The significant problems we face today, cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at, when we created them”.

The challenges of today and the emerging challenges of tomorrow need creativity, design-thinking and a solution-seeking mind set and competence. 

The solutions should lead to a more inclusive, sustainable world. 

In all our actions, there should be Value for Many, besides Value for Money.

Dear students,

We need sustainable solutions for the common man’s everyday challenges. We need good policy support and resource-management advice from Institutes such as this, for our science, technology and innovation to fructify and improve the quality of human lives.

Please focus on being among the best in your field. Shun mediocrity. Let excellence be your guiding principle.

Dear young friends, 

Passionate professionalism and positivity can help convert potential into possibilities and propel you to higher levels of performance. 

My concluding piece of advice to you, students, is the same message that Swami Vivekananda had given to the youth, based on the Upanishadic call to “Awake, arise and stop not till your goal is reached”. Keep your eyes wide awake, keep your ears to the ground and keep moving gathering knowledge and using it with wisdom to create a better planet. 

I am proud of IIM Visakhapatnam and its accomplishments. With its many firsts, it has all that it takes to scale greater heights of performance. I am therefore positive that this Institution of National Importance will attain standards of global excellence in management-education, management-research and allied areas of knowledge, fulfilling the Objects enshrined under the Act. 

 

I wish you all the very best.

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for speedy disposal of election petitions and criminal cases against political leaders pending before various courts. He also suggested the setting up of separate benches to expedite all such cases within six months or one year.

The Vice President also wanted the presiding officers of legislative bodies to decide anti-defection cases within three months.

Interacting with eminent lawyers, judges and the members of the Bar Association here in Visakhapatnam today, Shri Naidu recollected his early days as a law student in Andhra University and shared his cherished memories with the gathering.

Speaking at the 125th anniversary celebrations of Visakhapatnam District Court Bar Association, he expressed concern over the pendency of cases at various courts and said that time bound approval of applications and disposal of appeals was absolutely essential.

Pointing out that a large amount of money was locked up in long pending tax-related litigations, the Vice President said that delays in judicial litigations and proceedings could affect the image of the country.

Expressing concern over pendency of 3.12 crore cases at various courts, Shri Naidu urged upon the Courts and the Bar Associations to seriously dwell on the matter and see that pendency was reduced.

Quoting a popular adage, ‘Justice delayed is justice denied’, Shri Naidu emphasized the need to undertake reforms to improve the functioning of judicial institutions to ensure speedy justice and equitable justice particularly to the common man.

Saying that Indian Constitution envisages independence of judiciary, Shri Naidu said that the all the three organs - the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary must share healthy and mutual respect and complement the role of each other. No one should encroach into others’ domains, he added.

Pointing out that India is among the fastest growing economies, he said: “the whole world is now looking towards India as an investment destination. However, we need to ensure that there is a transparent, predictable policy regime and a sound judicial, regulatory system in place”.

The Vice President said that a robust regulatory architecture gives confidence to investors, especially for a country like India that has become a bright spot for investments.

The Vice President reminded the advocates that founding fathers of the Constitution reposed implicit trust and faith in the legal community and urged them to protect the constitutional values.

Shri Naidu also urged the Bar Association to also promote usage of local languages in courts as it was convenient and appropriate that the proceedings were held in the respective state’s official language.

Pointing out that there was a general feeling that due to mushrooming of Law Colleges in every nook and corner without any infrastructure, library or good faculty, the standards of legal profession were coming down substantially,  Shri Naidu called upon all the Bar Councils to see that those type of Law Colleges do not mislead the students and ensure that a proper mechanism and standards were set in place.

Shri Justice A.V. Sesha Sai, Judge, High Court of Andhra Pradesh, Ms. B.S. Bhanumathi, District Judge cum Chief Patron, Shri M.K. Sitaramayya, Chairman, The Visakhapatnam District Courts & Bar Association, Shri Bandaru Rama Krishna, President, The Visakhapatnam District Courts & Bar Association, several retired and sitting Judges, Sr. Advocates and members of the Visakhapatnam Bar Association and several eminent citizens of the port city were present at the event.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to interact with eminent lawyers, judges and all the members of the Bar Association here in Visakhapatnam today. My association with this City of Destiny dates back to the year 1970 when I joined the Campus Law College in Andhra University.
It was here that I was elected as President of the Students Union for the College of Arts, Commerce and Law of Andhra University that gave me recognition as a leader and stood in great stead in the later years of my public life. 

I used to visit this Court’s complex as a student of Law for observation of proceedings as part of curriculum.
It was here that I had the great fortune of coming in contact with selfless freedom fighters like Tenneti Viswanadhamgaru, Gowthu Lachchannagaru and others.

During the dark days of Emergency, I was arrested and detained in the Central Jail, Visakhapatnam where I had the fortune of interacting with some of your members, notable among them was late Rachakonda Viswanadha Sastry. I also remember to have interacted with several others in this city, including late Tata Sreerama Murthy.

It was here that I had made many good friends and I still continue my association with them. The adulation I got here is immeasurable. Moreover, this is the place of my daughter’s in-laws. Thus my association with Visakhapatnam has been very intimate which I always cherish.

I studied law wanting to become an advocate and get justice to the people. However, I was influenced by Loknayak Jayprakash Narayan’s clarion call for Total Revolution and then I chose a legislative career instead of a legal career. I don’t need to dwell upon on the rest of my journey and suffice it to say that I deem it as a great honour to occupy the second highest Constitutional post in the country with the added responsibility of presiding over the Upper House, the Rajya Sabha.

Visakhapatnam Bar Association was formed in 1880. This year marks the 156th year of District Court and 139th year of Visakhapatnam Bar Association (VBA). Now the Bar association has thought it fit to commemorate its existence of 125 years, better late than never.

As you all are aware, VBA has a glorious and hoary past. It produced a number of stalwarts, legal luminaries, upright Judges, freedom fighters, social workers, journalists, law book authors and peoples’ representatives.

Visakhapatnam Bar Association has a great history of having produced eminent leaders both in the legal fraternity as well as in Indian Politics. Late Tenneti Viswanadhamgaru, a member of this Bar, a stalwart among the political leaders in India was well known for his selfless service to the People and as Minister in the then State of Andhra . He was instrumental in bringing agrarian reforms and espoused Public cause for setting up Steel Plant at Visakhapatnam.

Late Sri M. Chalapathi Rau, a highly respected and noted Journalist who was Editor of National Herald, Late Sri Mantha Rama Murthy whose book ‘The Law of Wills’ is a sought-after publication to this day, late Smt. D. Saraswathi Devi, who hails from a family of freedom fighters and late Ms. P. Jaganmohini.

They were many members of this Bar Association worth emulating.

A few among them are late Sir Vepa Ramesam who later became Officiating Chief Justice of Madras High Court for the Composite State of Madras which included the present State of Andhra Pradesh till linguistic States were formed. Few lawyers of this Bar became Judges of the A P High Court.

Late DV Subba Rao, who served as chairman of the Bar Council of India and many of your members are not only well versed in law, but they are scholarly, multi linguistic and great interpreters.

It is gratifying to note that many Judicial Officers who worked here were nurtured and groomed with profound legal knowledge and they discharged their duties with aplomb in different capacities, including as acting Governors, Chief Justices, Upalokayukthas, Chairman and Members of Tribunals, Law Secretaries and Registrars of High Courts.

They all debated important questions of Law of far reaching implications and in many cases, they delivered landmark judgements which found their way into Law reports. Many a sensational criminal trial yielded pronouncements of very important propositions of law, valid even today.

Thus, the VBA deserves to be proud of its past history at this momentous hour of quasi-quicentennial celebrations. I am sure that the present generation of advocates will uphold the great values established by their predecessors.

Dear friends,

Judiciary is an important constitutional organ and not only plays a major role in ensuring Constitutional equilibrium between competing and conflicting interests of various stakeholders and other organs of State, but also is the ultimate interpreter of Law.

Coming to justice delivery system in our country, it is indeed a matter of concern that the pendency of cases is huge at various levels. Although, various factors, including shortage of manpower and lack of adequate infrastructure, can be attributed for the increase in arrears, it should be the endeavour of everyone associated with judiciary to work towards early disposal of cases. 

Quick disposal of cases will provide immense relief to those knocking at the doors of judiciary.

With the advancement of technology, both Bench and Bar need to make optimum use of it for improving efficiency. Needless to say that we are passing through a critical phase in every walk of life as we are migrating from a feudal and agrarian society to modern democratic and industrial nationhood. It is indeed painful phase and all the institutions including Judiciary are being stressed. But there can be no let up, as otherwise we will lag behind and future generations would fault us.

Dear Friends,

Judiciary has always been looked up to as an important instrument to bring about social change. As you all are aware, law enjoys and uses unifying power to contribute towards better social cohesion and can act as a tool for bringing about homogeneity in the heterogeneous population with socio-cultural diversities.

Though there are several ways to bring about a change and reformation in society, reformation through law is perhaps one of the most effective and safest methods to achieve this end.

The founding fathers of modern India took this theory further by reading the expression “for the people” as indicative of the desirability to set up a governance that works “for the welfare of the people”.

Judiciary is a key pillar of our democratic polity. It is meant to be the dispassionate monitor of Constitutional values. Being the crucial pillar among the three pillars of democracy, judiciary ensures that the constitutional provisions are followed both in letter and spirit.

India was founded as a democratic welfare State which would allow equal opportunity to each and everyone, irrespective of caste, creed, colour and sex; a State where everyone would have equal opportunity for personal growth and for contributing to the cause of nation. Judiciary which is the most important aspect of ensuring equality has a major role to play.

In my view, judiciary also has a crucial role to play in deepening our democratic roots. It can do so by ensuring speedy justice, even handed justice and justice that is perceived to be entirely fair.

The total pendency in all courts across the country, including the HCs and the apex court, has crossed an all-time high of 3.12 crore.

Courts and the Bar Associations must seriously dwell on the matter and see that pendency is reduced. Encouraging Mediation process and pre-litigation Lok Adalats can give positive results. Gram Nyayalays in rural areas can relieve farmers and villages of hardship and exorbitant cost of litigation.

Dear friends,

I would like to draw the attention of you and the Bar Associations across the country on the need to take steps to improve the quality of output from the Law Colleges.

There is a general feeling that due to mushrooming of Law Colleges in every nook and corner without any infrastructure, library or good faculty, the standards of legal profession are coming down substantially.

Bar Councils must see that these kinds of Law Colleges do not mislead the students wanting to become lawyers and ensure that a proper mechanism and standards are set in place. You must also take active steps to upgrade the syllabus and follow it up with relevant ministries.

I am happy to note that in recent past, the quality of law graduates has improved by some measure, thanks to the establishment of National Law Schools all over India. But data indicate that most of the graduates from these Colleges are not seeking to become lawyers in the portals of Courts, more so trial Courts, and instead they are opting for high-end corporate jobs.

Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Bar Council to take urgent steps to set the things in right direction.

I urge the Bar Association to also promote usage of local languages in courts as it is convenient and appropriate that the proceedings are held in the respective state’s official language.

Dear friends,

Advocates have to constantly remind themselves that our noble Constitution enshrined individual and group rights to all citizens of this great country and all of us have to zealously protect them and guard against all kinds of erosion.

The confidence of the common man in the Judiciary is an ample testimony of the significant role of judiciary and its valuable contribution in enforcing Rule of Law in accordance with the principles and values enshrined in the Constitution of India.

The Founding fathers of our Constitution reposed implicit trust and faith in the legal community. As social engineers, lawyers have to play a crucial role in the overall development of our country in all spheres.

New subjects like Environment Law, Cyber Law, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code are fast developing and making strides. Some more subjects are emerging. Our new crop of lawyers, have to hone their skills to remain relevant and survive in this competitive field, lest, they will perish.

As a person of legal fraternity, I am alive to the difficulties faced by the Legal practitioners.

I wish that this Bar continues to be a beacon for great values which it has established to follow as an example for others.

Hon’ble Judges and Distinguished Members of Bar,

As the people expect the Courts to deliver expeditious justice, I would urge upon all of you to take measures to expedite disposal of the cases. I am also quite aware of issue of the large number of vacancies. 

Apparently, large amount of money is also locked up in long pending tax-related litigations. It should be noted that any delays in judicial litigations and proceedings can affect the image of the country.

Friends,
India’s economy is on a growth path. We are currently among the fastest growing economies in the world. The whole world is now looking towards India as an investment destination. However, we need to ensure that there is a transparent, predictable policy regime and a sound judicial, regulatory system in place.

A robust regulatory architecture gives confidence to investors. Time bound approval of applications and disposal of appeals is absolutely essential.

The Indian society is changing at a fast pace. Marginalized groups are actively seeking social justice. Justice and the Legislature have been sensitive to the need to protect the rights of these groups. This intent has to be carried out in practice.

Friends,
While our Constitution envisages independence of judiciary, all the three organs— the Legislature. Executive and Judiciary should share healthy and mutual respect and should complement the role of each other. No one should encroach into others’ domains.

We all need to ensure that our constitutional principles and rule of law are respected by every citizen and nobody should be allowed to violate them with impunity.

We all are familiar with the popular adage, ‘Justice delayed is justice denied’. Keeping that guiding principle in mind, we need to undertake reforms to improve the functioning of judicial institutions to ensure speedy justice and equitable justice particularly to the common man.

As regards election cases pending before various courts, they need to be disposed of expeditiously.

Election petitions and criminal cases against political leaders must be decided quickly by special benches of higher courts in a time-bound manner. If need be, separate benches may be setup to expedite such cases within six months or one year.

Similarly, the presiding officers of legislative bodies need to decide anti-defection cases within three months time.

I once again compliment the bar association for their successful journey and my best wishes for their future endeavours in serving the society.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that every citizen must become a change agent and contribute to the building of a more empathetic, caring and harmonious society. 

Delivering the Badrivishal Pannalal Pitti Memorial Lecture being organized by Badrivishal Pannalal Pitti Trust, in Hyderabad today, Shri Naidu said that people like late Shri Badrivishal exemplified the role of such socially conscientious citizen and practiced India’s age-old philosophy of ‘Share and Care’.

The Vice President said that there was every need to draw inspiration from people like Shri Badrivishal Pitti to bring about a change in the attitude of people in the increasingly materialistic world. Every citizen must become a change agent and contribute to the building of a more empathetic, caring and harmonious society., he added.

Opining that traditional Indian joint families have traditionally been effective in inculcating the values of sharing and caring, the Vice President said that the sense of bonding was intrinsic to joint families and said that the present fast-paced lifestyles, work-related stress and the growing trend of nuclear families have their own down side.

The Vice President lauded the efforts of Badrivishal Pannalal Pitti Trust for their social service activities especially education and healthcare.

Pointing that growing urban-rural divide with lack of adequate education and health facilities in villages, gender discrimination, caste barriers, communalism, religious extremism, regionalism, neglect of the elderly and atrocities on women were some of the challenges that need to be collectively addressed by every citizen

Shri Naidu said that challenges could be addressed effectively only if the government and the civil society come together. He called upon NGOs like Badrivishal Pitti Trust to make every effort in eradicating various social evils and building a new and prosperous India, which shall be free of narrow prejudices, corruption, illiteracy and poverty.

Stressing upon the need to revive the old values of humanism and philanthropy, the Vice President opined that the society must collectively strive to build a nation that cares for others, respects different points of view, values contributions and services of the elderly, respects women and their rights, upholds the democratic principles and empowers the citizenry.

Opining that health and education must get the adequate attention from everybody including the government, private sector and the society at large, the Vice President said that important activities such as providing affordable health care and making agriculture sustainable and should not be left to the government alone. They must become peoples movements to get the desired results, he added.

Pointing to the rise in the life styles diseases and the adverse impact of changing food habits, the Vice President stressed the need to get back to roots and practice the time tested methods. He asked the youth to lead a healthy lifestyle and said that 'a healthy nation can become a wealthy nation and there is no guarantee that the reverse is possible'.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to be present here to deliver the Memorial Lecture being organized by Badrivishal Pannalal Pitti Trust in Hyderabad today.

मुझे हर्ष है कि बद्रीविशाल पिट्टी ट्रस्ट के माध्यम से बद्रीविशाल जी के कृतित्व और विचारों का निष्ठापूर्वक पालन किया जा है। 

1928 में हैदराबाद की प्रतिष्ठित मारवाड़ी परिवार में जन्मे श्री बद्रीविशाल पन्नालाल पिट्टी जी की  समाजवादी चेतना प्रखर थी। वे आजीवन दुर्बल वर्गों के लिए सेवारत रहे। अपनी लोकतांत्रिक प्रतिबद्धता के कारण आपने तत्कालीन निज़ाम से अपने पारिवारिक संबंधों को दरकिनार करते हुए हैदराबाद में लोकशाही की स्थापना का समर्थन किया।

1955 में सोशलिस्ट पार्टी के गठन में आपकी महती भूमिका रही और आप संयुक्त सोशलिस्ट पार्टी के उम्मीदवार के रूप में आंध्रप्रदेश विधान सभा के सदस्य चुने गए। आप आजन्म अलग तेलंगाना राज्य के गठन के प्रबल समर्थक रहे।

अपने जीवन में बद्रीविशाल जी हमारे प्राचीन आदर्श - "" मानव सेवा से माधव सेवा""  को अपने जीवन में आत्मसात करते रहे। मुझे हर्ष है कि उनकी स्मृति और आदर्शों को ट्रस्ट ने जीवित रखा है और बढ़ाया है। ट्रस्ट गरीब मेधावी छात्रों को छात्रवृत्ति और अन्य सुविधाएं प्रदान कर रहा है। इसके अतिरिक्त ट्रस्ट विशेषज्ञों के माध्यम से गरीबों के लिए निःशुल्क स्वास्थ्य सेवा उपलब्ध करा रहा है।

Badrivishal Pannalal Pitti ji was a great philanthropist, educationist, socialist and a great connoisseur of art, music and literature.

Born into a wealthy Marwari family in 1928 that settled in Hyderabad two centuries ago, Badrivishal Pannalal Pitti made a mark as a socialist leader and had worked dedicatedly for the welfare of the poor and needy.

Shri Pitti participated in the first conference of the Hyderabad State Congress and spoke in favour of a democratic dispensation in the State keeping aside his family’s close association with the Nizams. He came into contact with the firebrand socialist thinker and leader Ram Manohar Lohia, participated in Lohia’s civil disobedience movement and became a life-long socialist.

He had also played an important role in the founding of the Socialist Party in 1955.

Badrivishal Pitti was also elected to the Andhra Pradesh legislature as a Sanyukt Socialist Party candidate and was a staunch supporter of the demand for a separate Telangana. He passed away in 2003.

I am glad that the Badrivishal Pitti Trust, founded in his memory in 2004, is engaged in different types of social service activities with greater focus on providing scholarships and note books to deserving students. I was happy to know that healthcare is another area on which the trust is focusing by conducting free medical camps where doctors from different specialties attend to the needs of the poor. Glad to know that the trust provides free spectacles after eye check up for those who cannot afford them.

I am told Shri Badrivishal Pitti had never allowed his politics to have any bearing on the Hindi magazine, Kalpana which he had published for almost three decades since 1949.

Dear friends,

Shri Badrivishal exemplified the role of a socially conscientious citizen, who had practiced to the hilt India’s age-old philosophy of ‘Share and Care’. There is a need to draw inspiration from such people and bring about a change in the attitude of people in the increasingly materialistic world.

Every citizen must become a change agent and contribute to the building of a more empathetic, caring and harmonious society.

Joint families have traditionally been effective in inculcating the values of sharing and caring. The sense of bonding is intrinsic to joint families and had been leaving a positive impact on those who grew up in such an environment. 

Fast-paced lifestyles, work-related stress and the growing trend of nuclear families have their own down side and I need not elaborate on that.

Dear sisters and brothers, ours is a rich ancient civilization and from time immemorial we believed in the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. At one time, India was called the ‘Vishwaguru’ and we contributed up to 27 per cent of the world GDP. Following waves of foreign invasions and colonization, we lost our pre-eminent position.

Today, India is on the rise again. World over, India is respected for its economic growth, democratic values and practicing Gandhian principle of non-violence.

Yet, in spite of the remarkable progress achieved in various fields from space to agriculture, we have many challenges to overcome. About 20 per cent of Indian population still lives in poverty and an equal percentage of populace continues to be illiterate.

Growing urban-rural divide with lack of adequate education and health facilities in villages, gender discrimination, caste barriers, communalism, religious extremism, regionalism and atrocities on women are some of the challenges that need to be collectively addressed by every citizen. Neglect of the elderly citizens is another area that has to be tackled in a concerted manner.

These challenges can be addressed effectively only if the government and the civil society come together. The problems are too huge and too complex for government alone to handle.

I call upon NGOs like Badrivishal Pitti Trust to make every effort in eradicating various social evils and building a new and prosperous India, which shall be free of narrow prejudices, corruption, illiteracy and poverty.

We must revive the old values of humanism and philanthropy.

We as a society must strive to build a nation that cares for others, respects different points of view, values contributions and services of the elderly, respects women and their rights, upholds the democratic principles and empowers the citizenry.

I am delighted to learn that the Trust earmarks Rs 2 Crore annually to do social service, including taking care of the elderly. I am hopeful that these noble acts by the Trust would inspire many corporate and organizations to do their bit.

Service gives immense satisfaction and this was summed most succinctly by none other than the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, who said: “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.”

JAI HIND!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that farmers were critical for the well-being of the nation and they play a huge role in ensuring and maintaining home grown food security in India. He was delivering the keynote address at the annual event 'Connect Karo', organized by the WRI India, here today.

The Vice President said that collective actions were needed to correct development strategies to include preservation of nature. Talking about the serious impacts of Climate change, he opined that it was necessary that government, people and the private sector join hands to restore the balance that had wittingly and unwittingly disturbed.

Opining that everybody has stakes in the survival of the civilization, Shri Naidu called for constructive people’s movement on initiatives such as tree plantations, keeping surroundings neat and clean, educating the women and girl child, changing lifestyles to avoid the disease burden and others to correct the maladies in our society and to make our civilization environmentally sustainable. School children must be taught about the importance protecting and preserving the nature right from their school days, he added.

The Vice President said that increase in urbanization, cutting of forests, rise in energy consumption by way of increased use of cars, electricity, and others have led to indiscriminate use of resources across the globe and accelerated climate change. To arrest such trends, he advised for judicious and sensible use of natural resources and consciously adopt a low carbon growth path, without compromising on our economic development. 

Shri Naidu said that in the Indian context, the cultural traditions of worshipping nature can provide additional inspiration for concrete, accelerated action. We should love and live with nature and preserve nature and culture for a better future, he added.

The Vice President stressed upon the need to take steps to make agriculture more remunerative and sustainable. In order to increase farmer’s income, we have to enhance their access to markets and equipped them to produce adequate quantity of nutritious food to ensure home grown food security, he added.

Shri Naidu called for efforts from scientists, agriculturalists and the policy makers to see that land resources were used efficiently by reducing intensity of harnessing vital natural resources like land and water for producing per unit of nutrition. Constructive debate must take place on the rise and impact of population and its growth based on the availability of resources and its impact on environment, he added.

Saying that India’s commitment towards renewable energy sources had led to the setting up of the International Solar Alliance, the Vice President said that the sector has the potential to create new jobs for men and women across India, contributing to the overall GDP of the country even as we find solutions for complex problems of clean energy. He also called for the urgent need to take systematic measures to improve air quality as it adversely impact the health and well-being of city residents, especially our children.

The Vice President said that climate change was the most common challenge faced by the world and said that the best way to face the challenges of climate change was to be friendly with nature and live in harmony with it. Nature culture together for better future, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“Today, as we gather on this platform, we are looking at one of the major problems facing the world today.  We are all together fighting the common challenge of climate change that threatens our planet. And as we brace ourselves to cope with this challenge, we will have to marshal all our intelligence, knowledge, science and understanding of nature to do that.

Climate change is upon us. 

But we must admit, it has given us ample warnings.

Across the world, weather related disasters have been increasing in frequency and intensity.From wildfires to hurricanes, droughts, flash floods, the world has been ravaged by natural calamities all through last year. 

India has had its own share of disasters. In 2018 alone, Kerala saw the worst floods in 100 years;in North India, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and a few other states, were hit by a massive dust storm; and in Maharashtra, several districts suffered severe drought even as Mumbai experienced erratic rainfall throughout the monsoon months – from two deluges in June and July to almost no rainfall in August and September. There were many others. 

In view of India’s high population density, any disaster in India impacts many more people than it does in other parts of the world. We know that India is going to become the most populous country in the world within the next generation. More than half our population will live in cities by then. Delhi will become the most populous city in the world, overtaking Tokyo. 

Even as our population grows, our economy is also growing. India is set to become the third largest economy in the world. 

As incomes grow, people legitimately want better lifestyles. They want bigger houses, more cars, more air-conditioning, more energy and bigger offices.  But, this also means more urbanization, more energy consumption, more carbon emissions, more waste generation, more air pollution and a higher demand for land. 

All of these will accelerate climate change, unless we are careful and consciously adopt a low carbon growth path, without, in any way, compromising on our economic development. It is, therefore, imperative that we use our natural resources sensibly. 

This is possible and several countries, which also have limited natural resources, have shown that it is possible to chart out a low carbon path. We must learn to maximize our resources and not be wasteful in our behavior.

Having said this, let me dwell on a few important challenges that India is facing and what we are doing to deal with them.

The country is seeing a rapid demographic transformation. Urbanization is taking place rapidly. From just 62 million people in 1951, our cities had over 377 million people in 2011, as per our last census. The share of the urban population went up from 17.3% in 1951 to 31.2% in 2011. Today, we understand that it has risen even further - to 34 % according to the UN - and predictions are that it will exceed 35 % by the next Census year 2021. 

While this is a good sign and a manifestation of our shift from being a predominantly agricultural economy to a manufacturing and service sector economy, it also means a need to invest in our cities. 

Studies have shown that we need to invest over Rs. 34 lakh crores in our urban infrastructure in the next 20 years. However, the public budget cannot afford this and resources have to come from other sources. 

The private sector will need to invest in a big way. Private capital has to be tapped by making our investments bankable. The limited public funds have to be leveraged for this. The smart cities mission launched by the government seeks to do precisely this. 

A growing urban population, along with growing income, has led to rapid motorization. This has meant severe congestion that adversely impacts the economic efficiency of our cities. It has also led to poor air quality and an increasing incidence of road accident deaths. Unfortunately, we are seeing nearly 400 road accidents deaths every day, causing untold misery to those who lose their near and dear ones. 

The government has been according high priority to investments in public transport systems, including metro rail systems. These need to be planned well and as part of a comprehensive mobility plan. Stand-alone metro systems are not effective and need a holistic approach. 

Globally, the mobility sector is also witnessing several new paradigms. Shared mobility systems, electric vehicles, bicycles and connected vehicles are beginning to occupy center stage in the global mobility systems. These are welcome changes and will have the impact of reducing traffic congestion, cleaning up the air and reducing the need for parking space. We have to leverage these changes and mainstream them into India’s mobility planning.  We have to also focus more on the Inland Water transportation and utilize the vast river resources we have in our country.

Let me now turn to our electricity sector. Today we can rightfully say that the era of shortages in electricity is gone. We are producing enough electricity today. However, we do have the challenge of distribution. Electricity needs to reach the remotest of homes and this has been problematic. Over 200 million people have extremely poor access to electricity. India, like most other countries of the world, has invested in a big way in coal-based thermal power. Coal fired power is expensive, unsustainable, highly water intensive and contributes to massive air and water pollution. 

It is imperative that we enhance the share of the electricity we generate from cleaner sources like wind and solar. 

We have taken up an ambitious program to enhance our solar energy capacity. 

In the 2015 Paris Agreement, India made an ambitious commitment that by 2030 about 40 per cent of the nation’s installed energy capacity would be from ‘non-fossil fuel’ sources. 

Our commitment towards renewable energy sources has led to the setting up of the International Solar Alliance, the first treaty based international inter-governmental organization headquartered in India. 

India’s installed solar generation capacity has grown over 10 times in the last five years.  Today, this sector is creating new jobs for men and women across India, contributing to the overall GDP of the country even as we find solutions for complex problems of clean energy. 

Our air quality has been a matter of concern. Every winter many parts of the country face ambient air quality that is extremely poor. This cannot be allowed to go on. We need to systematically identify the sources of the problem and deal with them. Otherwise this will adversely impact the health and well-being of city residents, especially our children. 

Let me now turn to our food systems. Our farmers are critical to our well-being as a nation, as they feed us. We must not forget that farmers are the lifeline of urban India. The wellbeing of our hard-working farmers, plays a huge role in ensuring and maintaining home grown food security in India. Agriculture must become more remunerative and sustainable. In order to increase farmer’s income, we have to enhance their access to markets. Schemes like E-NAM should be expanded to cover entire country.  

As our numbers grow, we will need more food, and our farmers will have to be equipped to produce it in adequate quantity. We need to  ensure home grown food security. 

Our land area is already limited, as I have mentioned earlier. So, we have to produce more from the same land. This can only happen if we use our land resources efficiently. 

This will mean better cropping practices like “ Per Drop More Crop”and reduced waste in the movement of food from the “farm to the fork”. The objective is to reduce intensity of harnessing vital natural resources like land and water for producing per unit of nutrition. Perhaps, what we should measure is not the tons of paddy produced per hectare, but the units of nutrition produced per hectare.

Greater tree cover can improve the use of dry and degraded land and also remove carbon from the atmosphere. It is for this reason that we have committed to restore 13 million hectares of degraded landby 2020 and an additional 8 millionhectares by 2030. We have also committed to sequester 2.5 – 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by improving our tree cover. 

Many of the challenges we face today need innovative solutions. Business as usual will not work. 

As a means to promote innovations and encourage young innovators, the government has opened its doors to startups through platforms like Standup India, Startup India, Digital India, etc., which will bring smart initiatives on a level platform and encourage innovations. 

I am glad that there is a growing recognition of the contribution that small businesses and startups can make towards addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. I am also happy that special benefits and incentives are being given to startups today.

We need to build 1.8 million affordable houses by 2022. The time is short and funds are limited. We also want to use clean technologies. With a view to bring in new technologies the Government has taken up a global housing construction technology challenge, to get the best technologies around the world – technologies that are clean, cheap and allow quicker construction. 

I am delighted to learn that WRI India has been a knowledge partner to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in this. 

I am also delighted to learn that WRI India has contributed to seeking innovative solutions for last-mile connectivity to metro rail stations and to promoting better bus systems. These will prove extremely useful. 

I am told that WRI India has also been working with the Governments of Maharashtra and Haryana towards promoting safety in transport systems. I compliment them for these efforts. These are examples of how we can all work together towards a sustainable future. 

Our lofty goals will compel us to carve a path that is both innovative and holistic at the same time. Innovative, because it will be making a major departure from the profit-at-any-cost developmental model we are used to. Holistic, because it will set an example by building a circular economy based on reducing waste, recycling, reusing and respecting our natural resources.

Beyond Public-Private binary in our discourse, we should strive to build Public-Private Partnership where both the sectors bring synergy in their respective strengths to bring about public welfare through innovative private enterprise.

We are poised to become a five trillion dollar economy by 2024. Our sights are higher - to become a 10 trillion dollar economy in eight years thereafter.

I am hopeful and confident that, with a wise and stable approach, we can support our burgeoning urban and rural population -- to live well and with dignity, with access to safe and affordable living spaces, clean air, water, healthy and nutritious food, well-networked and equitable transport. We will also strive to make India pollution free again. 

Climate change is threatening us, but it has also brought many of us together, those who sincerely care about it. 

That is why events like WRI India’s Connect Karo, which strive to bring together a variety of stakeholders on the same platform, are of great value today. It brings us together in the true sense – a single connected nation, society, and world. 

It is also an opportunity for us to restore the balance we had wittingly and unwittingly disturbed. 

We should probably say “Correct Karo” in addition to “Connect Karo” so that we collectively correct our development strategies to include preservation of nature.  

In the Indian context, the cultural traditions of worshipping nature can provide additional inspiration for concrete, accelerated action. We should love and live with nature. Preserve Nature and culture for a better future.

We need to ameliorate certain unwarranted bye-products of our energy-intensive civilization. We all have stakes in the survival of our civilization. It is a task which cannot be done by the Governments alone. It will be my earnest appeal to help create people’s movement for Swachh Bharat, for Tree Plantation, for Per Drop More Crop and for the sake of our daughter Beti Bachao Beti Padhao. Government programmes can supplement but not substitute constructive people’s movement to correct the maladies in our society and to make our civilization environmentally sustainable. Each one of us have stake in the success of these programmes. Each one of us have a stake in a better brighter future.  

We have a huge task ahead of us.  I am glad that WRI is taking the initiative to connect all the stakeholders and move forward towards concrete action. 

I wish you all the best and echo the collaborative approach ancient sages of India had envisaged when they said, “Let us move and work together, let us share a meal together, let us acquire knowledge together and let us put our knowledge to good use”.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that for a democratic country like ours to thrive and flourish, our press should be efficient and fearless. He asked the journalists to serve as a mirror to society as he asked them to be the voice of the voiceless. He was addressing the 132nd Foundation Day Celebrations of 'Deepika', the first Malayalam Daily, here today.

Saying that a efficient and fearless was necessary for a democratic country like India to thrive and flourish, Shri Naidu asked the journalists to portray the reality as it is, neither magnifying nor diminishing, neither distorting nor mystifying facts.

Saying that the dignity and reputation of a newspaper rests on the degree of their loyalty to truth and fearless reporting, the Vice President said that one expects media to not just report accurately but also to highlight social and economic injustices, thus paving way for their redressal.

Shri Naidu said that it is also the duty of the newspapers and the media in general to support the government in its developmental initiatives and policies as well as to pinpoint its lapses, so as to help improve the effectiveness of the administrative setup in our country. He asked media to play a vital role in creating awareness about the legal provisions on such matters and empowering citizens by making them aware of their inalienable rights.

Pointing that media has a crucial role to play during the time of elections, the Vice President said that the fairness and the transparency with which the elections were conducted would be determined greatly by how fairly and responsibly the media would behave.

Talking about elections, the Vice President said that a free and fair election was not just about the freedom to vote and the knowledge of why and how one should cast a vote. It is a crucial participatory process where voters take part in informed public debate, making enlightened, he said.

Opining that a democratic election could not be credible with no media freedom, or stifled media freedom, Shri Naidu said that media safeguards the transparency of the entire process.

The Vice President advised media to maintain a high level of professionalism, accuracy and impartiality in their coverage. He urged the media to do their duty during the time of the elections with great discretion. Empower the voter with information to make the best possible use of their crucial right to vote, he added.

Shri Naidu asked media to be fearless in bringing the wrongdoers to light. Never be hesitant to report positive stories and always offer appreciation and words of encouragement to those who are making a positive change. You have the significant responsibility of watching over the conduct of the most important event in any democracy and never fail to offer constructive and creative criticism wherever necessary, he added.

The Vice President opined though the media have traditionally been understood to refer to the print and electronic media, in recent years, the definition has become broader, including new media, online journalism, and social media. Social Media has immense capacity for propagating information, including fake news, he added.

The Chairman of Rashtra Deepika Ltd. Dr. Francis Cleetus, the Chief Editor of Deepika, Fr. Boby Alex Mannampplackal, the Managing Director of Deepika, Fr. Mathew Chandrankunnel, the Associate Editor of Deepika, Shri George Kallivayalil and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to know that 'Deepika', the first Malayalam Daily and one of our country's pioneering regional dailies is celebrating its 132nd foundation Day today.  

I congratulate the management, editorial staff, the journalists and the entire Deepika Family, on having achieved this unique milestone, in spite of innumerable hardships and challenges along the way.

I understand that the founding fathers of Deepika, led by Fr. Emmanuel Nidhiry, a renowned social reformer of the times, had envisaged very noble and lofty goals while establishing the newspaper in 1887. 

These included protecting and safeguarding the inalienable rights of the people as well as standing boldly on the side of truth, justice, freedom and equality among all communities and religions. 

These ideals brought about a new vision and dimension to the then nascent profession of journalism in Kerala.

I am told that Deepika also played a crucial role in the dissemination of important information during the freedom struggle. It is indeed gratifying to know that Deepika contributed greatly to the freedom movement.

My dear sisters and brothers,

India is the only market in the world where print media continues to dominate and is growing in all aspects — circulation, readership and geography.

It is believed that the growth of newspapers in India is directly related to rising literacy rates and rapid urbanization, leading to higher aspirations.

Print medium allows for greater civic and political engagement and involvement in national affairs. It is accessible, affordable and has great potential for growth due to the rising and upwardly mobile middle class.

Thus, print medium today exerts tremendous influence, power & reach and therefore, should concentrate on truthful, unbiased and timely reportage.

Journalists are perceived to be the voice of the voiceless and as the crusaders for justice, social, economic and political. They help in preventing social exploitation and aid and abet the process of empowerment of the downtrodden through the power of information and knowledge.

They also act as a bridge between the government and the governed. 

For a democratic country like ours to thrive and flourish, our press should be efficient and fearless. 

They should serve as a mirror to society and portray the reality as it is, neither magnifying nor diminishing, neither distorting nor mystifying facts.

The press in India has almost all through the years since independence, except for a brief dark time during the emergency, enjoyed freedom of expression, which has contributed greatly to the fortification of our democratic institutions.

The dignity and reputation of a newspaper rests on the degree of their loyalty to truth and fearless reporting.

We expect media to not just report accurately but also to highlight social and economic injustices, thus paving way for their redressal.

It is also the duty of the newspapers and the media in general to support the government in its developmental initiatives and policies as well as to pinpoint its lapses, so as to help improve the effectiveness of the administrative setup in our country. 

Media thus forms the fulcrum that balances the entire edifice of democracy and gives it the required stability. 

I am happy to note that Deepika has been exemplary in upholding and propagating such virtues throughout the 132 years of its dignified existence. Its track record of credible reporting is truly impressive.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Media is no longer just the conveyor of news to its readers and viewers, but also forms one of the platforms for expressing views and conducting informed debates on issues of public interest of the day. 

They are powerful opinion makers.

With advances in information and communication technologies, the reach of media has increased manifold.

There is, therefore, a need for the media to handle its influencing capacity, with a deeper sense of responsibility to the nation.

It is often said that then pen is mightier than the sword. Media should wield the immense power at its disposal with great discretion and self restraint.

It should be the democracy’s most potent weapon in fighting social prejudices, fundamentalism, dogmatism and social evils.

I am truly impressed to know that Deepika has been a crusader for social reform and for the removal of untouchability in Kerala since the newspaper’s very inception.

It is heartening to note that it played an important role in the renaissance and reformation that took place in Kerala in the late 19th Century.

These actions do justice to its name - 'Deepika' - which means 'Torchbearer', a bringer of light into the darkest of spaces.

Adopting a socially responsible approach to create awareness in society is another essential role of the media.

Social issues, especially those relating to women, children and the elderly, should be handled with sensitivity and not sensationalized.

In India today, many social evils continue to persist even though there are strict legislations against them. Dowry, child marriage, female feticide and infanticide have crippling effects on the lives of many.

I strongly believe that the media can play a vital role in creating awareness about the legal provisions on such matters and empowering citizens by making them aware of their inalienable rights.

My dear sisters and brothers,

The biggest festival of democracy, the elections are set to happen in a few weeks’ time.

Media plays several roles especially during the time of elections.

It serves as an informer and educator, a platform for public debates and discussions, a watchdog that ensures transparency, accountability and legitimacy of individuals, institutions and processes and as an effective campaign platform.

The fairness and the transparency with which the elections are conducted would be determined greatly by how fairly and responsibly the media would behave.

A free and fair election is not just about the freedom to vote and the knowledge of why and how one should cast a vote. It is a crucial participatory process where voters take part in informed public debate, making enlightened choices.

Furthermore, media safeguards the transparency of the entire process.

Indeed, a democratic election cannot be credible with no media freedom, or stifled media freedom.

In order to fulfill their roles, the media need to maintain a high level of professionalism, accuracy and impartiality in their coverage. 

I urge the media to do their duty during the time of the elections with great discretion. Empower the voter with information to make the best possible use of their crucial right to vote.

Be fearless in bringing the wrongdoers to light.

Never be hesitant to report positive stories. Always offer appreciation and words of encouragement to those who are making a positive change.

You have the significant responsibility of watching over the conduct of the most important event in any democracy. Never fail to offer constructive and creative criticism wherever necessary.

Though the media have traditionally been understood to refer to the print and electronic media, in recent years, the definition has become broader, including new media, online journalism, and social media.

Social Media has immense capacity for propagating information, including fake news.

Keeping in mind that almost a third of India’s 900 million voters are active on social media, global and Indian social media outlets have agreed to follow a ‘voluntary code’ to take down objectionable content’ and to bring ‘transparency in political advertising’. 

It has also been proposed to set up a notification mechanism by social media platforms for action against violations under Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act. 

These are indeed welcome initiatives by the Election Commission in curbing the amplification of false news through the social media grape vine and in ensuring transparency and credibility.

My dear sisters and brothers, 

I have confidence that the media in India will concentrate on a constructive approach, and be an integral and responsible partner in pushing forward the agenda of inclusive and sustainable development.

Today, under the auspices of Deepika’s economic and financial magazine, Business Deepika, business excellence awards are also being presented to outstanding achievers. 

The private sector has been instrumental in the overall industrial, commercial and economic growth of our country

I congratulate the selected business award winners and urge them to work harder and to contribute in even greater measure to the nation’s socio-economic growth and development.

Deepika has always been an innovator and trendsetter in the field of journalism as well as in introducing new technologies in newspaper publication.

I applaud the setting up of a UV printing facility at Deepika’s new press, a first among Kerala newspapers.

I encourage 'Deepika' to keep up in its efforts to set a new and a positive trend in journalism, as it continues its onward journey. I am confident that this approach will take you to new heights and will make you ever more popular.

Let me reiterate that media plays a crucial role in building an aware, responsible and well-informed society so as to enable progress, development, peace and harmony in our country and all over the world.

I once again congratulate the Deepika family for this great accomplishment and wish them all the very best in their future endeavours. 

Thank You.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon all educational institutions to work towards becoming centers of excellence providing quality, affordable, meaningful education to students.

Opining that upgrading the quality of higher education institutions was an essential component in realizing India’s demographic dividend, the Vice President asked educational institutions to interact and work with industry to build world class infrastructure to train students to compete in global job market. He also wanted them to attach more importance Knowledge and Skill while designing curriculum for students to train them to make professional with employable skills. 

Addressing the gathering after presenting awards at the ‘Ranking of Engineering & Management Educational Institutes in India’ event hosted by Jagran Prakashan Group today, the Vice President said that providing high quality education must be a matter of sacred trust between a student and the institution as they would be joining these institutions with a hope for a better future.

Shri Naidu asked educational institutions and their management to consider the fact that most of the students might not have enough resources to fund their education in costly professional institutions and might have taken loans. He also said that rankings must help students and their parents understand the complete detail about the institute, infrastructure and its academic and research potential.

Opining that the future of the country and our society was taking shape in youth’s dreams, Shri Naidu stressed upon the need to train our youth and impart higher order skills in order to tap into the enormous human resource in them.

Talking about his interactions with the faculty members, students and youth since assume the office of Vice President, Shri Naidu said that every such occasion had been an immensely enriching and a rewarding experience for him and the aspirational optimism among our young students was infectious.  It has been knowledge pilgrimage for me, he said.

Talking about India’s growth story and its prospects, Shri Naidu said that youth participation was an essential component in taking new strides. He stressed that addressing the problems such as the urban rural divide, hidden hunger, inequalities, and disparities at various levels was necessary to take the nation on an inclusive growth trajectory.  He also stressed the need to have a special focus on rural India by making agriculture more viable and profitable. 

The CEO of Jagran New Media, Shri Bharat Gupta, the Editor-in-Chief of Jagran New Media, Shri Rajesh Upadhyay and representatives of more than 30 educational institutions, students were present at the event.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“मुझे हर्ष है कि मुझे उच्च तकनीकी शिक्षा की गुणवत्ता जैसे महत्वपूर्ण विषय पर आप सभी विद्वतजन के साथ अपने विचार साझा करने का अवसर प्राप्त हुआ है। जागरण प्रकाशन द्वारा देश के तकनीकी और प्रबंधन शिक्षा संस्थानों का विभिन्न मानकों पर मूल्यांकन कर, उन्हें प्रकाशित किया गया है। देश में उच्च व्यावसायिक शिक्षा की गुणवत्ता परखने और सुधारने की दिशा में यह अभिनंदनीय प्रयास है। इस समय कक्षा 12 के विद्यार्थी अपनी बोर्ड परीक्षा लिख रहे हैं। इन परीक्षाओं के बाद उन्हें अपने भावी कैरियर का चुनाव करना होगा। ऐसे में जागरण प्रकाशन का यह प्रयास और भी प्रासंगिक बन जाता है। मैं विद्यार्थियों और उनके अभिभावकों को उन के उज्ज्वल भविष्य के लिए शुभकामनाएं देता हूं।

 

I am delighted to be amongst this august gathering of media and academia on this occasion of ranking the Engineering and Management educational institutions in India. I am happy that this event is being organised at an opportune time when students of Class 12th are writing their exams and will soon have to choose their career. I do believe that a fair majority of those in science streams will join these Engineering and management institutions with a hope of a gratifying and enriching professional career. It is our social obligation to provide them with quality professional education. I am told that around 13 lakh students are taking class 12th exams that are being conducted by CBSE alone. Then there are also the students affiliated with State Boards. I convey my best wishes to these students for their bright career. 

These rankings will guide the students and their parents, to choose the institution that holds a promise for their future.  We should be mindful that most of the students may not have enough resources to fund their education in costly professional institutions and may have taken loans. They will be joining these institutions with a hope for a better future. Therefore providing quality education is a matter of sacred trust between a student and the institution. 

Ever since I have assumed office, it has been my endeavour to engage with faculty members and students from educational institutions. I must say that every such occasion has been an immensely enriching and rewarding experience for me. The aspirational optimism among our young students is infectious. It fills me with hope and optimism about country’s bright future. 

I have always believed that the future of the country and our society is taking shape in their dreams. 

As a society we need to respect the aspirations, aptitude and capabilities of our youth. We are fortunate that we have 65% of our population which is below 35 years of age. We need to realise this demographic dividend if we aim to sustain our high growth rate. We need to train our youth and impart higher order skills if we wish to tap into this enormous resource. We must upgrade the quality of our higher education institutions.  The ranking exercise helps to focus on different aspects of quality. 

 

Friends, 

Earlier, India was known as the Vishwa Guru. Our famous Universities of Taxila and Nalanda received scholars and researchers from around the world. Our achievements in abstract sciences and applied technologies were immense. 

We have to take inspiration from the past and create institutions of excellence today. That’s the challenge before the education policy makers and education managers.  That’s the challenge before our academics and researchers. 

Today, the technology is moving at an unprecedented pace.  We have to catch up with the 4th Industrial revolution. As we promote manufacturing sector, we have to adopt newer technologies like Artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing. We should be at the forefront of the knowledge revolution.  

Keeping the demand of rapidly expanding economy for professional skilled manpower, we have expanded our professional education sector. What we need to ensure is the quality of higher education.

If we look at the current scenario, we become aware of the gross inadequacies in the system. A recent study has concluded that only 3% of our engineering graduates have knowledge of the new emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, Data science etc.  Only 1.7% engineers have skill sets required for new emerging jobs. Only 40% engineering graduates did single internships during their graduation and only 7% did more than one internship. 

Young engineers had very little employable skills and practical knowledge. Greater emphasis is being given to the theoretical aspects.  Commenting on the faculty in the professional institutions, the report says that 60% of the faculty Members did not discuss the industrial applications of concepts as per emerging job requirements in the industry. It should be a matter of concern that our professional education is not aligned with the needs of globalised job market. Our professional graduates cannot afford to lose out in this 4th Industrial Revolution. It’s time we took note and worked towards a system that consistently delivers high quality learning.  

A recent study jointly conducted by Stanford University and the World Bank, too found that learning outcome of our engineering graduates were poorer in comparison with Russian and Chinese engineering graduates.  

Except for certain IITs and IISc, our institutions do not figure prominently in global rankings. Due to poor quality of educational infrastructure and faculty in several such institutions, students are not even enrolling even if the seats are lying vacant. Recently, AICTE has decided to shut down institutions that report less than 30% enrolment for 5 consecutive years. As such 800 such institutions are being shut down. 

Even the Department related Parliamentary Committee on Human Resource Development has raised concern about the issues and challenges faced by higher education sector in the country. The Committee found that there was an acute shortage of highly qualified faculty in the professional institutions and it was true for both-public funded as well as private institutions. The Committee found that there was no effective mechanism for ensuring the accountability and performance of teachers in the universities and colleges. Such a mechanism is a well established norm in foreign universities where the performance of college professors/ teachers is evaluated by their peers and students.

AICTE and other institutions should constantly review and align the curriculum, pedagogy and teaching methods of our professional courses in accordance with globally reputed institutions. Professionals must upgrade their knowledge and expertise by taking up periodic training in new technologies, participating in Seminars and workshops and taking up research and teaching assignments. 

I have learnt that the Government has evolved an exhaustive National Institutional ranking Framework (NIRF) that evaluates an institution on parameters like Teacher, Learning resources; Research and Professional practice; Graduation outcome; Outreach and inclusivity and Peer perception. The performance on these broad parameters are further judged on the basis of 18 templates. 

I am happy that the Government has decided to help 20 institutions to develop into global institutions. I hope that these institutions will learn from the best practices from abroad and adapt them to the Indian context. 

 

Friends, 

With around 7% growth rate, we are one of the world’s fastest emerging economies today.  In the next few years, we are likely to become a US $ 5 Trillion economy. India is emerging as one of the most promising Start up Hub. 44% of our 16000 Start ups are located in smaller towns. This indicates the inherent entrepreneurial culture and talent of our youth.

 

Friends, 

To leverage our demographic dividend in global economy, to utilise emerging opportunities in knowledge based global economy, our professional institutions will have to impart the skills needed for the 21st century.

I hope that such Ratings of Engineering and management institutions, by the independent bodies on the basis of scientifically designed metrics through transparent survey and interactions with stakeholders and peers, will encourage the Institutes to improve their teaching and training infrastructure, faculty and learning outcomes. 

The ultimate outcomes of such exercise are to be seen in the classrooms of our institutions as they move on the path towards excellence. 

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for medical universities to introduce teachings in human values as a part of the curriculum to inculcate moral, social and ethical values in students. He was delivering the 3rd Convocation Address of Mahatma Gandhi University of Medical Sciences & Technology, in Jaipur, Rajasthan today. 

Shri Naidu appreciated the rather young University for having blossomed into an important center for providing quality medical education and healthcare in a short span of time.  He complimented Dr. M.L. Swarankar and his team for their commitment and dedication towards making the institution one of the foremost centers of excellence in terms of quality teaching, training, research, innovation and affordable patient care in India.

Stating that education laid the foundation for the progress of a nation, the Vice President said that the right kind of education would inculcate citizenship values, liberate people from ignorance, empower them with knowledge, information, skills and equip them to take up new roles and responsibilities to shape not only their own destinies but also the destiny of the nation. 

The Vice President opined that educational institutions for higher learning have to develop a system to impart relevant and right type of education integrated with skills. ‘India’s educational ethos needs major reforms in the context of changes that are sweeping the country and the world’ he added. 

Urging universities to deliver a more comprehensive medical education, which develops the total personality of the young medical graduates, Shri Naidu called for the inclusion of subjects like medical ethics, human behavior sciences, philosophy, culture, heritage, meditation and Yoga in the curriculum.

Imploring the students to ‘Never give up’, the Vice President said that neither success nor failure is permanent. ‘Believe that perseverance, hard work and unshakable determination - shall always triumph’, he emphasized. 

Shri Naidu highlighted India’s achievements in providing basic and advanced health care since Independence and raised caution against the twin burdens of communicable and non-communicable diseases that India is bearing today. 

Speaking of lopsided infrastructure development in the health sector., the Vice President called for the provision state-of-the-art healthcare facilities in the rural and remote areas on par with the modern hospitals in urban areas. 

Shri Naidu urged the private sector needs to supplement the efforts of the government, especially in bridging the urban-rural divide. He also suggested to make it mandatory for MBBS graduates to serve in rural areas before granting the first promotion to them in a bid to overcome shortage of doctors in rural areas.

Observing that in India Doctors are considered next to God, the Vice President said that it was the cardinal responsibility of all those entering the medical profession to uphold the trust and confidence of the patients who seek treatment from them. 

The Vice President reminded the students that they were members of a noble profession and asked them to always remain committed to upholding the Hippocratic Oath. ‘Maintain the highest standards of ethics and integrity at every stage’, he told the graduating students.

Speaking of the affordability of medical care, Shri Naidu said that medical costs were mostly met out-of-pocket by the people in India. He expressed deep concern over the debt trap into which impoverished patients got into due to medical treatments. He expressed happiness upon the launch of Ayushman Bharat – National Health Protection scheme to provide universal health care to 500 million poor and vulnerable people.  

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" I am delighted to be ‘Chief Guest’ and deliver the 3rd Convocation Address of Mahatma Gandhi University of Medical Sciences & Technology at Jaipur. 

I thank Dr. M.L. Swarankar, an IVF specialist and the Chairperson and Chancellor of this University for inviting me to share my thoughts with the students, faculty and others associated with this university.

I am told that Mahatma Gandhi University of Medical Sciences & Technology – rather a young and self-financing State University was created by an act of Rajasthan Legislature in the year 2011. In a short span, it has blossomed into an important center for providing quality medical education and healthcare.  

I am told that this institution is offering graduate and postgraduate programmes of medicine, super-specialties, Dental Sciences, Nursing, Physiotherapy, Occupational therapy, M.Sc, B.Sc, Ph.D in medical subjects and diploma / certificates in Paramedical Sciences.

With an attached medical college hospital having more than 1500 beds, I am told that it has so far successfully done more than 650 kidney transplants, 14 liver transplants, two heart transplants, one pancreas transplant and a lung transplant in a span of five years. 

I am told that a modern Cancer therapy Centre and super-specialties of Neurosurgery, Cardiac Surgery, Uro-surgery and Transplant Surgery have been recently added. 

I must compliment Dr. M.L. Swarankar and his team for their commitment and dedication and working in the direction of making this institution one of the foremost centers of excellence in terms of quality teaching, training, research, innovation and affordable patient care in India.

My dear young friends! Convocation, besides being a ceremony to rejoice and receive degrees, is also an occasion to introspect and chalk out your future goals.  

Education lays the foundation for the progress of a nation. Through right kind of education, we can inculcate citizenship values, liberate people from ignorance, empower them with knowledge, information, skills and equip the youngsters to take up new roles and responsibilities to shape not only their own destinies but also the destiny of the nation. 

Educational institutions for higher learning have to develop a system to impart relevant and right type of education integrated with skills. India’s educational ethos needs major reforms in the context of changes that are sweeping the country and the world. 

It is high time that the teachings in human values be also introduced in the medical education. The need has arisen in view of the degeneration in moral, social and ethical values. 

We must also seriously think of delivering a more comprehensive medical education, which develops the total personality of the young medical graduates. Subjects like medical ethics, human behavior sciences, philosophy, culture, heritage, meditation and Yoga must become part of the course.

I congratulate the students who have received their degrees, medals and academic prizes. Today, you are standing on a bridge between the past and the future. Education is a life-long process of learning, while graduation is but a milestone in your journey as you begin a new chapter of your life. 

Remember that you are the architect of your future. Hard work always pays. There is no substitute for hard work. Greater the hard work, greater the dividends of success. It is important to dream high and set goals. Equally important is to work hard to achieve your goals.

My dear graduates, you might face setbacks at times. But that should not upset you as neither success nor failure is permanent. Obstacles and difficulties are part of the journey to success. Believe that perseverance, hard work and unshakable determination - shall always triumph. Never give up. 

As all of you are aware, we came a long way in providing basic and advanced health care since Independence. We are able to improve life expectancy, reduce maternal and infant mortality rates and improve quality of life in general.

However, we are facing the twin burdens of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Although polio, tetanus and small pox were successfully eliminated, diseases like TB, malaria, chikangunya and dengue are still prevalent. Also lot more efforts are needed to further bring down IMR and MMR indices across the country.

An area of concern that needs to be addressed is the lopsided infrastructure development in the health sector. Although PHCs, Taluk hospitals, and District hospitals are catering to the health requirements of the rural people, much more needs to be done to provide state-of-the-art healthcare facilities in the rural and remote areas on par with the modern hospitals in urban areas. The private sector needs to supplement the efforts of the government, especially in bridging the urban-rural divide. 

One of the ways to overcome shortage of doctors, particularly in rural areas is to make it mandatory for MBBS graduates to serve in rural areas before granting the first promotion to them. 

Dear students, you must remember that not many have had the benefit of such privileged education like yours. You therefore have a greater responsibility in building a healthy India. 

Doctors are considered next to God in our country and it is the cardinal responsibility of all those entering the medical profession to uphold the trust and confidence of the patients, who seek treatment from them. Remember that you are a member of a noble profession and always remain committed to upholding the Hippocratic Oath. Maintain the highest standards of ethics and integrity at every stage.

As regards affordability of medical care, medical costs are mostly met by out-of-pocket expenses by the people. For many poor and middle class families, hospitalization means disposing of family silver and getting into debt trap. 

I am happy that the government has launched Ayushman Bharat – National Health Protection scheme to provide universal health care to 500 million poor and vulnerable people.  

My best wishes to the students, teachers and the administrators of the Institution for all your future endeavours. 

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for a faster and more inclusive growth. He said that knowledge is going to be the driver of the growth of Indian Economy and will play a vital role in improving the living conditions of the people. He called upon Indian Universities to rise to the occasion and reorient its higher education system to be globally competitive and to realign their research goals to meet real challenges that India faces. 

He was addressing the 16th Convocation of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, established by the Reserve Bank of India, in Mumbai today. He applauded the Institute for having established itself as one of the excellent centers of higher learning and as an influential center of discourse on national and global development concerns. The Vice President gave away degrees to 43 graduating students and presented one gold medal for excellence.

On the occasion, the Vice President spoke about growth and development and highlighted the rapid economic progress and fiscal consolidation that India had undergone.  Shri Naidu said that an emerging economy like India would constantly bring in new laws and regulations at par with international best practices. He observed that tax reforms were slowly increasing India’s tax base and shifting the social norms from one where it was alright to avoid taxes to one where the majority is willing to pay.

The Vice President opined that India’s demographic dividend was an opportunity and a challenge. He said that finding jobs for 12 million young people entering the labor force each year and millions transferring out of low productivity agricultural jobs is a major and continuing task. 

Shri Naidu stressed that education is not only for employment, but also to empower the individual with knowledge and wisdom to sift the wheat from the chaff. ‘Access to quality education for all and at all levels is equally essential to ensure inclusive growth and prevent any kind of discrimination’, he added.

The Vice President emphasized that it was time for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub. He called upon the seats of learning, especially the universities, to reinvent themselves as hubs of vibrant intellectual pursuit with academic excellence and social relevance as the key touchstones of success. The Vice President also opined that our system of education and skill-training needs to respond to the demands of industry and services sector.

Touching upon agriculture and its importance in Indian economy, the Vice President said that we must not hesitate to introduce a number of structural changes in our agricultural sector to make it profitable. He highlighted initiatives like National Agricultural Market or e-Nam and spoke of the need to diversify crops further and increase the coverage of crop insurance.

Shri Naidu spoke of the need to augment our social infrastructure such as primary education, health care etc. Referring to Former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam’s dream of providing urban amenities in rural areas, he said that we have to aspire to provide amenities like drinking water, street lights, education, healthcare and telecom services to the country’s rural areas, bringing them at par with urban areas in terms of ease of living and working.

The Vice President said that India has to reach out to other countries to access cost-effective technology, investment, and energy to manage its domestic challenges. He called for appropriate economic and foreign policies to navigate through this emerging and uncertain landscape.

Shri Naidu urged scientists, technologists and engineers to keep abreast of the developments and absorb new technologies as they occur. He reasoned that this absorption is necessary for our progress in a fast integrating world. ‘We must identify areas and spheres where we have comparative advantage and push ahead’, he emphasized.

He urged the graduating students to learn to preserve the best of traditional values, shun negativism, develop a positive attitude and be socially conscious, peace loving and empathetic.  ‘Develop a constructive attitude and focus more on achieving perfection in whatever you do’, he said.

The Director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Dr. S. Mahendra Dev, the Dean, Dr. Jayati Sarkar and others dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I deem it a matter of great privilege to be invited to address the 16th Convocation of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research. Over its life of over three decades, the Institute has established itself as one of the excellent centres of higher learning. The Institute has emerged as an influential centre of discourse on national and global development concerns. Under the able leadership of its present Director Professor Mahendra Dev, the Institute has not only continued to build further on its initial strength but has added more dimensions. 

Addressing such a learned gathering as we have today, I would like dwell upon a few thoughts on some of the issues pertaining to Indian economy. 

Accelerated economic growth has been a major factor bringing down Indian poverty ratios, which were above 50 % in the 1960s. In 2011, after a series of global shocks, India’s macro economy was fragile, with a depreciating rupee, widening current account deficit, and high food inflation. Policy actions since helped improve these fundamentals. 

A path of fiscal consolidation and implicit flexible inflation forecast targeting was adopted in 2014. Be it in the overall macro-economic context or specifically in finance, an emerging economy like India is constantly bringing in new laws and regulations at par with international best practices. 

Tax reform is slowly increasing India’s tax base and shifting the social norms from one where it was alright to avoid taxes to one where the majority is willing to pay. Incentives are also working in that direction. 

Looking ahead, for India to be a USD ten trillion-dollar economy in 2030 its real rate of growth must be at least 7% per annum. If we can achieve this, we will shift firmly from the World Bank’s lower income group to the upper-middle income group, which starts at a per capita income of USD 3856.

India has to grow out of many bottlenecks including inadequate public services, congestion and pollution, issues in health and education, bottlenecks in land, labour and financial markets etc. An arduous path lies in front of us. 

For us to move to this growth path, we need to focus on research, innovation, sincere implementation and constant monitoring by following reform path. 

An economy in transition should be one which is innovating. New technologies that leverage youthful skills and reduce prices to target low income masses can give India a special advantage. Aadhar and GST give one of the world’s largest data base that can be used for various innovations including in fintech. Internet based businesses including retail will be a major source of innovations given India’s large consumer base. Shifting to renewable energy sources and environment friendly technologies will be another.

India’s demographic dividend is an opportunity and a challenge. 

By 2020 its estimated average age of 29 will be among the lowest in the world. 

But finding jobs for 12 million young people entering the labour force each year, and millions transferring out of low productivity agricultural jobs is a major and continuing task.  

In order to achieve the demographic dividend, some of the challenges for the country include improving healthcare, improving education facilities, skill development, developing good quality and low-cost housing, investment in physical infrastructure and and promoting small and medium enterprises while bolstering larger enterprises with global reach.

Please remember that knowledge is going to be the driver of Indian Economy and will play a vital role in improving the living conditions of the people. Therefore, India must rise to the occasion and reorient its higher education system to be globally competitive. 

The education system should be reoriented by moving away from the colonial mindset and teach history in an objective manner as it actually unfolded, the richness of ancient civilization, culture and heritage and instill the values of nationalism among the students.

Education is not only for employment. It should empower the individual with knowledge and wisdom to sift the wheat from the chaff. Access to quality education for all and at all levels is equally essential to ensure inclusive growth and prevent any kind of discrimination.

I would like to emphasize that the time has come for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub. For that to happen, the seats of learning, especially the universities, must reinvent themselves as hubs of vibrant intellectual pursuit with academic excellence and social relevance as the key touchstones of success. 

India’s development trajectory thus far stands out among other countries in that the economy has transformed from being predominantly agricultural in 1947 to being services dominated, largely bypassing the phase of rapid industrialization that other high income countries witnessed during their own development. 

While agriculture now accounts for less than a fifth of GDP, it still remains the main source of employment for nearly half the labour force. 

For the unskilled workers migrating out of agriculture it is the low value services and not manufacturing that is the first port of call. 

Share of manufacturing in total employment has remained fairly low at about 12 percent. This is in sharp contrast, not just with the developed countries, but even with Asian peers such as China and South Korea where it is higher at around 16 percent to 19 percent. The government’s “Make in India” initiative is driven by its desire for rapid structural change and growth. 

An important feature of Indian agriculture is the presence of very large number of farmers (about 90 million farm households), and the very low average farm size – majority of farms are less than 1 hectare. These millions of farmers typically sell their produce in to wholesale markets. Consequently, farmers do not benefit from high prices at the retail end. This market structure is an important reason for the low labour productivity in the sector. To improve labour productivity in agriculture, we need (i) innovative institutional arrangements for some form of “collective” marketing by farmers (e.g., cooperatives, farmer producer organization, etc.) to improve their bargaining strength in the market; (ii) greater on-farm value addition / agro-processing (cleaning, cutting, packaging, etc.), (iii) development of agricultural marketing chains and agriculture specific infrastructure, and (iv) development of agro-processing industries. 

Thus, we must not hesitate to introduce a number of structural changes in our agricultural sector to make it profitable. 

Initiatives like National Agricultural Market or e-nam have helped in improving the profitability of agriculture by better access to markets and information.  

We must also focus upon diversifying of crops further and increasing the coverage of crops under insurance. 

Goal 8 and Goal 5 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are directly relevant in the context of labour and employment. To recall, Goal 8 is “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all”, while Goal 5 is “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”. On both these aspects several issues confront the country. 

How to facilitate job creation for people looking for jobs and that are entering the labor force? The annual addition to working age labor force (those falling in the age bracket 15-59) is estimated to be in the range of 5.8 million for the period 2015 to 2030. It is estimated that India will have to absorb around 16 million persons in new jobs over the next 15 years.

The future skill-profile of workers demanded by Industry and services sector could undergo dramatic change. Our system of education and skill-training needs to respond to the demands of industry and services sector. The pace of skill development would also be important if we have to benefit from the demographic transition. 

We need to focus on skill upgradation and promote innovative entrepreneurship to meet the demands of various sectors, including agriculture.

We must also promote self employment, set up and empower more self help groups and promote village and cottage industries. 

Large proportion of India’s labor force is engaged in informal work or work in informal enterprises. The challenge is two-fold. How to incentivize the entrepreneur to set up new enterprises in the formal/organised segment of the economy? How to encourage currently operating enterprises in the informal segment to move into the organised sector? 

Gender disparity in labor market which has many dimensions needs to be addressed. The low share of women workers in organized sector and the lower wage per day of work for women in all types of wage employment are the striking features. 

Developing countries need, among other things, an infrastructure push to sustain growth over the next generation. Infrastructure can be divided into three parts: trade and transport corridors, industrial zones, and social infrastructure. 

Over the past decade, the importance of the West as the dominant source of international export demand has declined. Developing countries are confronted with the need to find newer markets within their boundaries and in other countries in the global south. This requires reorientation of westward trade channels through massive investment in intra-national (Bharatmala Project and Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor), inter-national (India-Afghanistan air corridor, Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project connecting India and Myanmar, and India-Bangladesh rail, road, and sea transport projects), intra-regional (BBIN /Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal projects), inter-regional (India-Iran-Afghanistan International Transport and Transit Corridor and India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway), and inter-continental (International North-South Transport Corridor and Asia-Africa Growth Corridor) physical connectivity. This is the context for the growing interest in domestic and transnational infrastructure over the past decade.

As far as the Social Infrastructure is concerned, building primary education, health care, and waste management facilities across the country, development of new small towns and renovation of existing towns and connecting them with local labour intensive manufacturing and services industries, and decongestion of existing metropolitan cities would be of utmost importance.

We have to aspire to achieve Former President Dr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam’s dream of providing urban amenities in rural areas, which he termed as “PURA”.  

The social inclusion programme he envisioned aims at providing amenities like drinking water, street lights, education, healthcare and telecom services to the country’s rural areas, bringing them at par with urban areas in terms of ease of living and working. 

What will the world look like in 2030? Where do we see ourselves in that world? How should we choose our objectives? How should we build capacity to pursue those objectives? The answers to these questions have to be located in our interlocked domestic and international contexts.  

To manage its domestic challenges, India has to reach out to other countries to access cost-effective technology, investment, and energy. India needs appropriate economic and foreign policies to navigate through this emerging and uncertain landscape. 

Our scientists, technologists and engineers must keep abreast of the developments and absorb new technologies as they occur. In a fast integrating world, this absorption is necessary for our progress. 

We must identify areas and spheres where we have comparative advantage and push ahead. 

Our development challenge can only be met by focusing on the expansion of the knowledge base. We must focus on improving the quality of research and fostering innovation.  That alone will be the required game changer. 

That is why we need institutions of excellence like Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research. May I wish everyone of you success in your future endeavors. 

My dear young friends who are being conferred with prestigious degrees today,

Convocation is a crucial ceremony in your life. It marks a significant transformation in your life. 

Let me impress upon you that the nation looks up to you with great many expectations. 

You must learn to preserve the best of traditional values, shun negativism, develop a positive attitude and be socially conscious, peace loving and empathetic.  Develop a constructive attitude and focus more on achieving perfection in whatever you do.

You should learn to love nature and live with nature and care for the preservation of natural resources and environment to create a more sustainable planet.

As you strive to reach these goals, you will face a number of challenges your way.  You will see as many setbacks as victories. 

But I am confident that you will surge ahead, armed with knowledge and wisdom and the many great qualities that this great institution has nurtured in you.

I am confident that you will be the authors of New India’s growth story. 

Let me congratulate you once again on this accomplishment. 

I wish each and every one of you and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research a very bright future. 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for a renewed focus on agribusiness, value addition and diversification of agriculture to make farming much more sustainable, profitable and rewarding. He was addressing the gathering at the Convocation of Vaikunth Mehta National Institute for Cooperative Management (VAMNICOM), a premier cooperative management institute focusing on Agri-Business Management in Pune, Maharashtra today. He also awarded medals to 3 achievers and presented Post Graduate Diplomas to 51 graduating students.

The Vice President applauded the vision of inclusive and sustainable growth that VAMNICOM, an institution named after Vaikunth Bhai Mehta the Minister of Finance and Cooperation of the then Bombay State and the first Chairman of Khadi and Village Industries Commission. He termed the contributions of Shri Mehta as ‘foundational to cooperative sector in India’.

Shri Naidu opined that Cooperative societies that are built on values that encourage cooperation, empowerment, and solidarity, rather than just profits, play a crucial role in strengthening rural economy and in ensuring socio-economic development for inclusive growth and sustainable development. He said that the cooperative sector has a big role to play in bridging the urban-rural divide and creating opportunities for income generation at grass-roots level.

The Vice President said that Cooperatives can help the small and marginal farmers who are in need of support in the form of inputs, harvesting, storage facilities, distribution channels and a network of the market information system. ‘They can help in mitigating rural distress by providing support facilities for farmers to ensure sustainability’, he added.

Shri Naidu spoke about the need to restructure our agricultural markets by removing middlemen and intermediaries, thereby helping farmers to directly interact with the consumers. He cited the national agricultural market, e-Nam as initiative that would greatly help farmers in this endeavour and said that e-Nam.

Pin pointing the issues faced by agriculture sector such as the rising cost of inputs, depleting water resources, lack of an organized market mechanism and the vagaries caused by climate change, the Vice President said that there is a need to make agriculture more profitable and ecologically sustainable.

Shri Naidu said that there was a need to introduce structural changes in the agriculture sector on a priority basis to ease agrarian distress. ‘The foremost need in the country is to double the income of the farmers by making agriculture resilient, sustainable and profitable’, he added.

The Vice President said that infrastructure development is one of the key factors to improve the agriculture sector and empower the farmers. ‘Improving rural road connectivity, setting up more godowns, cold storage facilities, ensuring assured water and electricity supply are some of the key measures which could be implemented’, he suggested. Rural infrastructure can help in value addition by improving the ease of activities such as paddy milling, oil seed crushing and processing fruits.

Shri Naidu spoke about the importance of providing timely, affordable credit to farmers in addition to providing a much more attractive crop insurance scheme. He stated unequivocally that populist measures such as loan waiver and providing free power supply would not help the farmers in the long run and are not permanent solutions. He opined that the farmer does not need freebies but proper marketing conditions to sell his produce. ‘There is also a need to remove restrictions on the movement of Agri-produce and free export should be allowed’, he added.

The Vice President also said that our farmers should be educated on the need to diversify crops and take up allied farm activities and encouraged to take up horticulture and the cultivation of cereals and pulses.

Shri Naidu suggested that the extension officials should be made to spend more time with the farmers. He added that visiting fields and staying with the families of agriculturists should be mandatory for students of agriculture to help them understand first-hand the problems faced by farmers.

The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri C. Vidyasagar Rao, the Secretary, Dept. of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Sanjay Agarwal, the Addl. Secretary, Dept. of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Ms. Vasudha Mishra, the Director, Vaikunth Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Management, Dr. K.K. Tripathy and others were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to attend the Convocation Ceremony of Vaikunth Mehta National Institute for Cooperative Management (VAMNICOM), a premier cooperative management institute and a pioneer in offering two-year full time residential Agri-Business Management programme at the post graduation level.

I am confident that the youngsters who graduate from this course will have a successful career in the Agri-business sector, including agri input sector, rural finance and banking.

First, let me congratulate the students who have been awarded degrees. It marks a well-deserved fulfillment of their academic objectives. All the professors, academicians and industry experts who tirelessly assisted the students in pursuit of their knowledge deserve to be lauded as well. I also felicitate the parents and well-wishers, who have supported the students throughout their journey.

While this day will be undoubtedly cherished for years to come by the students, I am confident that VAMNICOM will strive to set new benchmarks in the quest for strengthening the cooperative sector and improving agriculture.

VAMNICOM was set up with the vision of taking India forward with the noble ideology of inclusive growth and collectivization. This institute was named after Shri Vaikunth Bhai Mehta, who was a great visionary and pioneer in the area of rural and cooperative revolution.

The contribution of Vaikunth Bhai Mehta to the cause of Cooperative Education and Training was foundational. He said, ""Cooperative Training is not merely a prerequisite but a permanent condition of cooperative activities"". He served as Minister of Finance and Cooperation of the then Bombay State and was the first Chairman of Khadi and Village Industries Commission.

Since its establishment, VAMNICOM has been serving as an intellectual nerve center for the development of agriculture and rural sectors and contributing to the progress of Indian cooperatives.

It has been catering to the needs of the cooperative institutions/agencies and Central/State Government Departments through various short-term and long-term programmes on management training, education, research and also offering consultancy services to Government, cooperatives, corporate entities and others.

Dear students,

Cooperative societies play a crucial role in strengthening rural economy and in ensuring socio-economic development for inclusive growth and sustainable development.

Cooperative Movement acts as an enabler to unify local human resources and channelize energies for the growth of rural India. The Indian cooperative movement, the world’s largest movement, has its own inherent strength and weaknesses. With more than 8 lakh cooperatives, the cooperatives have a significant presence in all the areas of socio-economic activities.

Dairy cooperatives have ushered in milk revolution in the country. AMUL has become a household name.  Institutions like IFFCO, KRIBHCO, and AMUL are the big success stories in the cooperative sector. Besides, there are a large number of cooperatives at the state level, like urban cooperative banks, primary agriculture cooperative societies, housing, fishery and other forms of cooperatives which are making untiring efforts to improve the socio-economic condition of the people in the rural areas.

At grass-roots level, the cooperative sector has a big role to play in bridging the urban-rural divide and creating opportunities for income generation.

I am happy that your institution is helping cooperatives improve decision-making skills and administrative competence through the Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) & Post Graduate Diploma in Co-operative Business Management (PGDCBM), Programmes.

I am happy to learn that the VAMNICOM has been providing active support and guidance to 14 state level institutes of Cooperative Management (ICMs) and five Regional Institute of Co-operative Management (RICMs) through Faculty Development Programmes, apart from providing training on Agricultural Banking.

Built on values that encourage cooperation, empowerment, and solidarity, rather than just profits, cooperative societies play a vital role in providing support and sustainability to rural economic activities.

They are also recognized as means of implementation for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) along with other private sector enterprises.

Cooperatives can help the small and marginal farmers who are in need of support in the form of inputs, harvesting, storage facilities, distribution channels and a network of the market information system.

They must assume a greater role in mitigating rural distress by providing support facilities for farmers to ensure sustainability. Technical guidance is required to help agriculturists in processing their produce and reap benefits through value addition. Not having enough exposure to the changing market mechanism, lack of infrastructure facilities and technical skills are a few of the major obstacles faced by farmers and village artisans.

Faced with competition from the organized sector, they find extremely difficult to maintain their traditional employment. Such trends often create economic distress and result in experienced farmers migrating to urban areas in search of newer livelihoods. If we do not reverse this trend, we will be forfeiting the most valuable human resource that has the knowledge of farming and rural livelihood.

Through pooling of experience, knowledge and by helping one another, cooperative societies can help members to find solutions to problems. Farming cooperatives help farmers to pool their small and fragmented land holdings to take up intensive cultivation by using modern technology.

Agricultural processing cooperatives can provide support towards paddy milling, oilseed crushing, processing fruits, vegetables and so on. The farmers, gain through value addition to their product.

Agricultural marketing societies should enable farmers to benefit from increased bargaining strength. By removing intermediaries they help farmers to directly interact with the consumers. The Government’s e-Nam initiative will greatly help farmers in this endeavor.

Dear Friends,

Agriculture is facing many challenges from the rising cost of inputs and depleting water resources to not having an organized market mechanism and the vagaries caused by climate change.

In India, agriculture has traditionally played a vital role in economic development and continues to do so even till this day. Agriculture, along with fisheries and forestry, is one of the largest contributors to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The current challenge is to make it more profitable and ecologically sustainable. Being the second largest country in the world in terms of agricultural output, India must take the lead in reforming the sector.

The foremost need in the country is to double the income of the farmers by making agriculture resilient, sustainable and profitable. We need to introduce structural changes and both the Centre and various States need to accord the highest priority to this aspect. Concerted efforts are required from every stakeholder to ensure that there is no agrarian distress.

Infrastructure development is one of the key factors to improve the agriculture sector and empower the farmers. Improving rural road connectivity, setting up more godowns, cold storage facilities, ensuring assured water and electricity supply are some of the key measures which have to be implemented. Providing timely credit to farmers is equally important. Of course, as the economy improves interest rates have to be reduced further. The crop insurance scheme should be made more attractive and implemented effectively.

I have always been stating that loan waiver and providing free power supply are not going to help the farmers in the long run. They provide only short term relief. It should be realized that the farmer does not need freebies but proper marketing conditions to sell his produce. There is also a need to remove restrictions on the movement of agri produce and free export should be allowed.

The farmers should also be educated on the need to diversify crops and take up allied farm activities. A study by MANAGE has revealed that there were no suicides in the families of farmers, who took up allied activities.

I feel that the farmers should be encouraged to grow horticulture crops as also cultivate cereals and pulses.

The extension officials should be made to spend more time with the farmers. Similarly, it should be made mandatory for students of agriculture to visit fields and stay with the families of agriculturists to understand firsthand the problems of farmers.

It is a matter of concern that the number of people engaged in agriculture as a percentage of total employment has been steadily going down all over the world. From 43% in 1991, it is now a mere 26% in 2017.  In India also, while nearly 64% of the total workforce was engaged in agriculture in 1991, it was down to 44% in 2017.

The Government, Private Sector, Agricultural Universities, KVKs, Scientists and farmers must come together and address the pressing issues of farmers.

We need to have a positive bias in allocating resources to rural areas and help in developing a second income source for those who are solely dependent on agriculture income.

Dear sisters and brothers,

Agribusiness is an important sector and we need a large quantity of skilled manpower at managerial, supervisory and worker levels to give a fillip to this sector. In this regard, Institutions like the VAMNICOM must become facilitators to provide opportunities to those connected with agriculture and allied subjects.  

I must compliment VAMNICOM for doing a stellar job in the area of Agri-Business Management by offering a two-year fully residential Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) - Agri-Business Management (ABM) leading to the award of a degree equivalent to MBA. 

I urge upon the youth to tap the innumerous opportunities in agriculture, especially, in the field of agribusiness, agri clinic, and dairy entrepreneurship and become the change agents in making Indian farming a profitable enterprise.

Let me once again offer my congratulations to all students and convey my best wishes for their future endeavors. Finally, I would like to express my deep appreciation to the whole VAMNICOM family. I am sure, you will keep updating your knowledge base and give the students the best possible education.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for a renewed focus on rural health care and cautioned that the quality of healthcare being delivered cannot be determined by the price being paid. He was delivering the 13th Convocation Address of Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences, a Deemed University (PIMS-DU), in Loni, Maharashtra today.

Shri Naidu congratulated the 437 graduates who were being presented degrees and applauded their parents for supporting & trusting their wards, empowering them to fully explore their talents & creativity.  He also expressed delight that a large number of graduates who won awards and medals for excellence were women. ‘There is no tool for development more effective than women empowerment’, he said.

The Vice President appreciated PIMS-DU for striving to provide quality education & training to the health professionals of the nation. He said that it was rendering valuable service by meeting the healthcare needs of the rural & tribal populace at a time when India is aspiring to have more qualified doctors, nurses and therapists serving in rural areas. He suggested a mandatory rural service for doctors for 3 years.

Shri Naidu lauded Padmabhushan late Dr. Balasaheb Vikhe Patil for his efforts towards setting up Pravara and for his contributions to rural healthcare.

Opining that the youth of India would determine its future, the Vice President quoted United Nations Population Fund’s report which said that the window of demographic dividend opportunity in India would be available for 5 decades from 2005-06 to 2055-56, longer than any other country in the world.

The Vice President observed that the immense demographic advantage could create the space needed to increase investments in enhancing human capabilities, which, in turn, would have a positive influence on growth and development in the time to come. He emphasized upon providing quality higher education, especially professional and technical education as an imperative to empower the youth to play a meaningful role in nation building.

Outlining some of the major challenges faced by healthcare sector such as the epidemiological transition being witnessed by India from communicable to non-communicable diseases, unequal access to healthcare and rising costs, Shri Naidu said that a lot more needs to be done to ensure health security to our vast population.

The Vice President observed that urban areas had four times as many medical practitioners compared to rural areas, and said that this rural urban divide had to be addressed on war footing. He said that ‘Ram Rajya’ cannot be achieved without attaining ‘Gram Rajya’. He added that rural development was a cause close to his heart.

Highlighting the importance of technology, the Vice President said that with technology, it was possible to reach millions of people across the country, providing better diagnosis and treatment by facilitating effective collaboration between healthcare workers.

Expressing concern over the rising costs of providing medical services, Shri Naidu opined that the integration of technological innovation with healthcare delivery will certainly help in lower healthcare delivery costs. He urged all educational institutions to invest a sizeable portion of their budget in research and development for the discovery and advancement of new technologies.

Terming medical profession as a ‘mission’, Shri Naidu said that healthcare practitioners would play a critical role in nation building by safeguard the health of this nation, enabling it for it to take its rightful place of leadership in the world. ‘Only a healthy nation cab be a wealthy nation’, he added.

Shri Naidu urged all the young doctors and budding healthcare professionals to treat all their patients, both rich and poor, with the same commitment, investment, respect and integrity.

Reminding everyone of the lofty notion of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” that is engrained in the very DNA of Indian civilization, the Vice President implored the youngsters to let the ideal act as a beacon during testing times. ‘Nurture the values of nationalism, patriotism, honesty, peace, compassion, respect, harmony and co-existence’, he added.

The Vice President called upon the students to dedicate themselves to the service of mankind, mitigate hunger, poverty, ignorance and blind beliefs. ‘Today, you have made your University proud. It is time to go forth and make your nation proud’, he told them.

Pointing out that the word ‘Pravara’ meant ‘Excellence’ and ‘Eminence’, he urged the students to keep this grand tradition of ‘Pravara’ alive and blazing through their noble words and deeds.

The Governor of Maharashtra & the Chancellor of PIMS-DU, Shri C. Vidyasagar Rao, the Pro-Chancellor of PIMS-DU, Shri Vijay Kelkar, the recipient of Honorary Degree, Shri Ashok Panagariya and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am delighted to be amongst you to deliver the 13th Convocation Address of Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences – Deemed to be University, which is the brain child of Padmabhushan late Dr. Balasaheb Vikhe Patil – a true son of the soil. 

I have had a 25 year of long association with Dr. Balasaheb Vikhe Patil. He was a valued colleague in the Parliament. 

Although we belonged to two different political parties at that time, we always found converging areas of interest, especially in the field of rural development, a quest that is close to my heart.

He was much admired for his simple living and his commitment to undertaking developmental projects at the grassroots level.

Dr. Balasaheb Vikhe Patil is the proud son of late Dr. Vitthalrao Vikhe Patil, a legendary figure in the history of co-operative enterprise in the country. He pioneered the use of co-operative movement as a tool for social, educational and economic uplifting of the rural masses.

At the outset, I would like to congratulate Dr. Ashok Panagariya, who has been recognized by this University for his services to the nation in the field of Neurology and Medical Sciences by conferring an Honorary Doctorate upon him.

I understand that PIMS-DU offers Graduate, Post Graduate, PG Diploma, Diploma & Ph.D programmes under the faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing & Allied health Sciences.

It is truly heartening to note that as many as 437 graduates are being presented with their degrees in this convocation here today.

My heartiest congratulations to all of them for their achievements.

My sincere appreciation to the parents for supporting and trusting their children, thus empowering them to fully explore their talents and creativity.    

I am glad to note that PIMS-DU is striving to provide quality education and training to the health professionals of the nation. On the other hand, through its multispecialty tertiary hospital and its specialist doctors, nurses and technicians, PIMS-DU is providing tertiary health care to the rural population.

I applaud PIMS-DU for extending their health care and research to tribal areas also.

As India aspires to have more qualified doctors, nurses and therapists serving in rural areas, the PIMS-DU is rendering valuable service by meeting the healthcare needs of the rural populace. 

I appreciate the Loni PURA Model of PIMS-DU. Though rural in location, it is truly urban in terms of its facilities and amenities.

It is indeed a unique model of excellence.

I congratulate the visionary leaders Dr. Vitthalrao Vikhe Patil, Padmashri Awardee and Dr. Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, Padmabhushan Awardee for their foresight and missionary zeal.

 

My dear young friends, 

I strongly believe that it is the youth of a nation that will determine its future.

As you are all aware, India has a burgeoning youth population. United Nations Population Fund estimates that the window of demographic dividend opportunity in India is available for five decades from 2005-06 to 2055-56, longer than any other country in the world.

Demographic dividend is said to be occurring when the ratio of the working age population is high and the dependency ratio in terms of proportion of children and elderly people low.

The working age group 15-59 years accounts for 62.5% of India’s population.

This immense advantage can create the space needed to increase investments in enhancing human capabilities, which, in turn, can have a positive influence on growth and development in the time to come.

Thrust on quality Higher education, especially professional and technical education is imperative to empower the youth so that they can play a meaningful role in nation building.

I am extremely glad to know that this University is setting new benchmarks in excellence through its commitment to advancing meaningful teaching & learning, promoting need-based research, amplifying community engagement, and accelerating internationalization, all the while, serving the poor and the needy.

 

Dear Sisters and brothers,

In any student’s life, convocation is a crucial ceremony. It marks the completion of an important phase of life and symbolizes the beginning of the next significant phase.

Attainment of a degree is only a milestone and not an end in itself.

I am sure you all will take up the mantle for serving the nation selflessly.

Emphasis must be placed on continuous learning and updating of the existing knowledge base.

The world of Science and Technology is undergoing rapid transformation and I urge each and every one of you to be poised to absorb and utilize these innovations for the greater good.

Let me tell you that the future belongs to brilliant innovators and leaders whose priority is to serve the masses selflessly.

The career path you have chosen is rife with a number of challenges today.

It is true that we have achieved a number of significant milestones in the health sector since independence.

Life expectancy at birth has increased, infant mortality and crude death rates have been greatly reduced, diseases such as Small Pox and Polio have been eradicated, and Leprosy has been nearly eliminated.

Yet, a lot more needs to be done to ensure health security to our vast population.

India is undergoing an epidemiological transition today. The burden of non communicable, lifestyle diseases is on the rise, dominating over communicable diseases in the total disease burden of the country.

India also faces challenges of unequal access and rising costs in healthcare.

There is also low health insurance penetration, leaving a large section of the population to incur out of pocket health expenditure, pushing many families to poverty.

There is also a great rural-urban divide when it comes to healthcare.

Urban areas have four times as many medical practitioners compared to rural areas, making rural India grossly underserved. The quality of medical education of also varies between rural and urban centers.

Our Primary Health Centers which are the first point of contact for patients are face funding issues and infrastructural lacunae.

Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is the need of the hour.

UHC can resolve a number of issues we face in the health sector by standardizing healthcare infrastructure and providing value-based medicine.

Always remember that the healthcare sector represents a huge opportunity to leverage technology to improve critical processes that would aid the delivery of quality healthcare. 

With technology, it is possible to reach millions of people who are geographically spread across the country, providing better and more accurate diagnosis, managing treatment and facilitating effective collaboration and dialogue between doctors and healthcare workers.

The cost of providing medical services has also been rising steadily. The integration of technological innovation with healthcare delivery will enable scale and lower healthcare delivery costs.

I urge all educational institutions to invest a sizeable portion of their budget in research and development for the discovery and advancement of new technologies.

My dear young friends who are earning coveted degrees today,

Let me remind you that the profession you have chosen is a mission.

You will play a critical role in nation building.

I have said time and again that only a healthy nation is capable of being a wealthy nation. 

It is upto you to safeguard the health of this nation, enabling it for it to take its rightful place of leadership in the world.

It is truly unfortunate that the quality of healthcare delivered in this country is very often determined by the price that is being paid.

Today, I urge all the young doctors and budding healthcare professionals present here to treat all your patients, both rich and poor, with the same commitment, investment, respect and integrity.

In your able hands lie the power to transform lives.

Use your talents wisely and well.

Serve the nation with a passion and missionary zeal. Adopt the “kaizan” or the principle of continuous improvement to excel in all walks of life.

Further, nurture the values of nationalism, patriotism, honesty, peace, compassion, respect, harmony and co-existence.

The lofty notion of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” is engrained in the very DNA of our civilization.

Let this ideal act as a beacon to you during testing times. 

I am glad to know that Pravara Medical Trust was established in 1976 as a 100 bed hospital to serve the poverty stricken people of this drought and epidemic prone region.

It is indeed very heartening to know that today it has become a 1275 bedded hospital, offering super specialty services to the rural people of this district and neighboring districts at a very reasonable cost. 

I am told that this trust has also been providing free medical facilities to all the children below 12 years of age and to senior citizens.

I am also really impressed by the community engagement of this university including the adoption of more than 400 rural and tribal villages for the provision of health services. 

I congratulate the faculty and students of this university for being true “change agents”.

I am also delighted to know that this Rural University has strong   international engagement with over 31 active academic, research and medical care collaborations with Foreign Universities, Research and Development Organizations across the globe.

I call upon my young friends to dedicate themselves to the service of mankind, mitigate hunger, poverty, ignorance and blind beliefs.

Today, you have made your University proud.

It is time to go forth and make your nation proud.

The word ‘Pravara’ means ‘excellence’ and ‘eminence’. It is a word used to describe distinction and achievement.

I hope that all students passing out of the portals of this institution will, through their noble deeds, keep this grand tradition of ‘Pravara’ alive and blazing.

I congratulate the university, the faculty, the students and parents once again and wish them all the very best in their future endeavors.

 

Thank You!

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for fully tapping the enormous potential of the Blue Economy for the country to achieve higher economic growth.

Observing that the objective of the Blue Economy is to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and employment opportunities through maritime economic activities, the Vice President wanted appropriate programs to be initiated for sustainable harnessing of ocean resources.

Interacting with the Scientists of National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), in Dona Paula, Goa today, Shri Naidu pointed out that India was meeting most of its oil and gas requirements through imports and urged the scientists to step up their research in areas such as ocean energy and marine energy. “Scientists should study the potential of renewable energy derived from the ocean-- from wind, wave and tidal sources”, he added.

Asking the Institute to act as a nodal centre for Blue Economy related research and technology development, Shri Naidu said there was a need to focus on ocean centric technology to harness the marine resources for sustained growth of India. Development of technologies for deep sea mining, underwater vehicles and underwater robotics for extraction of minerals should be initiated. “NIO should also undertake research on development of drugs from the sea”, he added.

The Vice President said that a focused approach in some of the areas such as minerals from the ocean, energy from ocean can make India a global leader and serve our national goals. ‘However, while pursuing the “blue growth”, every effort must be made by all the stakeholders, including private and public sectors, to prevent further degradation of the ocean and its ecosystems’, the Vice President cautioned.

In view of global warming, resource degradation and marine pollution, we have to conserve and sustain our oceans as time is running out, Shri Naidu said and advised CSIR-NIO to play a major role through its ocean observation studies in understanding different ocean processes due to climate change.

Shri Naidu lauded NIO for providing specialized services to society in addressing ocean-related problems. He also expressed happiness that the institute helped in preparing India’s claim for an extended continental shelf with an area of about a million square kilometres.

The Vice President also attended a presentation on various aspects and applications of Oceanography and visited laboratories and exhibition galleries at NIO. He applauded the good work being done by the Scientists and Scholars of NIO, especially in the field of conservation.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to visit this institute and address all of you. After becoming the Vice President, I have decided to visit various scientific and research institutions to interact with scientists for a better understanding of the work being undertaken by them and share my thoughts.

I am glad to interact with all of you and get a deeper appreciation of the excellent work being done by you. Oceans are of vital importance for the wealth and the well-being of present and future generations. They hold 97 per cent of the planet’s water, while two per cent is found in glaciers and ice caps and only one per cent comprises earth’s fresh water. 

We are aware of the fact that oceans produce more than 50 per cent of the world’s oxygen and absorb 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide, buffering the impact of global warming, underlines the crucial role played by them. Thus, they help in regulating the global climate.

Oceans cover 72 per cent of the surface of our blue planet and provide humankind with food, minerals, energy, fresh water and oxygen. They regulate climate, emission absorption and shoreline protection and support livelihoods as well as job creation. Indeed, oceans are our life support system.

Currently, it is estimated that more than three billion people depend on marine and coastal resources for their livelihoods. Enhancing more than 80 percent of global trade, marine and coastal environments constitute a key resource for economic development.

Considering the importance of oceans on the life and sustenance of humanity, the United Nations has taken steps to declare the period 2021–2030 as the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. Further, the Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG-14) proposed by UN, which deals with life below the waters, emphasizes the importance of oceans in modulating and sustaining life.

With this background, it is important to prioritize our efforts in ocean science and technology to achieve the national goal of transforming India to be the third largest economy in the coming 10-15 years.

I am happy that CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography an autonomous body of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India is doing research on different aspects of Ocean such as the impact of climate change, marine biodiversity, coastal hazards such as coastal erosion and storm surge, marine hazards like tectonics and slumping of seabed.

I understand that foundation of ocean science is mostly based on observations. To take up ocean observation studies, scientists like you need appropriate tools and platforms. I am told that research vessels are an ideal platform to do ocean observations. Research vessels and their equipment represent a significant technological asset.

I am glad that two dedicated ocean-going vessels, RV Sindhu Sankalp and RV Sindhu Sadhana are managed by CSIR-NIO.  With these two dedicated vessels, I am sure that CSIR-NIO will be able to carry out all the relevant studies in India's Exclusive Economic Zone, which constitutes 2/3rd of our land area.

From the presentations made to be me by different groups, I understand that CSIR-NIO is playing a major role in understanding science of the North Indian Ocean such as dynamics of its circulation, basin-wide bio-geo-chemistry and tectonic framework of basin evolution.

I am informed that the efforts of CSIR-NIO led to establishing India as a pioneer in poly-metallic nodule mining with an allocated mining site of 75,000 sq. km in the central Indian Ocean.

I am glad that CSIR-NIO helped to prepare India’s claim for extended continental shelf with an area of about a million square kilometres and this institute launched India’s Antarctic research programme in the early 1980s.

I am also happy to note that the CSIR-NIO provides specialized services to society in addressing ocean-related problems, in addition to its planned research projects. I am happy to learn that this institute has successfully carried out more than 1300 projects funded by oil & gas companies, ports, power plants, chemical industries, municipalities and industrial estates.

I understand that CSIR-NIO has also carried out Marine Environmental Impact Assessments for several prestigious and nationally important developmental projects such as Sea Bird Project of Indian Navy at Karwar and others involving offshore prospecting for oil and gas by ONGC, HPCL, IOC and BPCL among others.

Dear sisters and brothers, development along the coast has been increasing over the years. I have been informed that the Government of India has already planned development of ports and allied facilities through Sagarmala. Different coastal economic zones are planned. The Sagarmala project, which seeks to modernize ports through IT enabled services, is expected to give an impetus to the economy.

With India looking towards oceans for the economic growth through the Blue Economy, important institutions like NIO will have to step up their research in areas such as ocean energy and marine energy. It should be noted that India is meeting most of its oil and gas requirements through imports. Scientists should study the potential of renewable energy derived from the ocean-- from wind, wave and tidal sources.

The objective of the Blue Economy is to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and employment opportunities through maritime economic activities within the Indian Ocean region.

All of you will agree that, India should fully tap the enormous potential of the Blue Economy to achieve higher economic growth trajectory and initiate appropriate programs for sustainable harnessing of ocean resources, research and develop relevant sectors of oceanography.

However, while pursuing the “blue growth”, every effort must be made by all the stakeholders, including private and public sectors, to prevent further degradation of the ocean and its ecosystems.

In view of global warming, resource degradation, and marine pollution, we have to conserve and sustain our oceans as time is running out. Hence, CSIR-NIO should play a major role through dense ocean observations and high-resolution ocean models over the Indian Ocean to meet the challenges in understanding different ocean processes due to climate change.

The Institute should also act as a nodal centre for Blue economy related research and technology development. There is a need to focus on ocean centric technology to harness the marine resources economically for sustained growth of India. Development of technologies for deep sea mining, underwater vehicles and underwater robotics for extraction of minerals should be initiated. NIO should also undertake research on development of drugs from the sea.

I strongly feel that focused approach in some of the areas such as minerals from the ocean, energy from ocean can make India a global leader and serve our national goals.

I wish all the success to each one of you ,the scientists and staff of CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography in your future missions.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu called upon the youth to strive to build a new India, which is free of fear, corruption, hunger, discrimination, illiteracy, poverty, caste barriers and urban rural divide.

Shri Naidu asked the youth develop a constructive attitude and focus on achieving perfection in whatever they do. ‘Learn to preserve traditional values, shun negativism, develop positive attitude, be socially conscientious, peace loving and affectionate’, he said. 

Interacting with Delhi University students, who called on him at his residence today, the Vice President said that it was ‘Advantage India now’. With India consistently achieving a growth rate of more than 7% for the past few years, he said the Indian economy was projected to become the third largest in the coming 10-15 years.

Saying that the future belongs to those who dare to dream and possess the courage, resilience and competence to create a better tomorrow, the Vice President said that one must strive to build an inclusive and a prosperous New India and usher in ‘Ram Rajya.

Asserting that knowledge would be the driver of Indian Economy, he called for reorienting of the higher education system to make it globally competitive. ‘The overhauling of the education system should totally eliminate colonial mindset and teach real history, ancient civilization, culture and heritage and instill the values of nationalism among the students,’ he said. 

The Vice President wanted the students to develop an attitude of gratitude, empathy, sharing and caring and told them to become sensitive to the needs of fellow human beings. “You must be in the forefront in the fight against social evils, bigotry,  prejudices and promote gender equity and inclusiveness”, he added..

Emphasizing that the time has come for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub, the Vice President opined that the seats of learning, especially the universities must reorient their ways of teaching, functioning and equip the students to seamlessly transit into the choice of their profession or enable them to become self-employed.

Referring to India’s demographic advantage, he stressed the provide adequate skilling and knowledge so that youth could become job creators instead of allowing of job seekers.

Observing that India was being recognized and respected for its tremendous growth and age old civilization values, the Vice President said the adoption of  UN resolution declaring June 21 as ‘The International Day of Yoga’ by 177 countries was a testimony to India’s growing influence.

Referring to the seven sins listed by the Father of  the Nation,  Mahatma Gandhi-- “Wealth without Work, Pleasure without Conscience, Knowledge without Character, Commerce without Morality, Science without Humanity, Religion without Sacrifice and Politics without Principle – he said they must become the guiding principles for shaping the ethical values of individuals, society, country and the world at large.

Shri Naidu reminded the youth about the importance of Character, Calibre, Capacity, Conduct, compassion, hard work and discipline to achieve success and realize their dreams. He asked them to always remember five things – Mother, Mother tongue, Native Place, Motherland and Guru.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the younger generation should be acquainted with our history, culture and heritage. He called for conservation and protection of archaeological sites as the sites stand testimony to India’s rich and vibrant heritage.  

He was addressing the gathering after releasing the three-volume book – ‘Felicitating a Legendary Archaeologist B.B. Lal’, edited by the eminent Archaeologist, Dr. B.R. Mani, the Air Vice Marshal (Retd.), Rajesh Lal, the Chairperson of Draupadi Dream Trust, Ms. Neera Misra & Dr. Vinay Kumar of Banaras Hindu University, here today.  

Shri Naidu expressed his concern that the India’s ancient history became a casualty of the Colonial Rule. 

The Vice President said that the research is an ongoing quest for knowledge and every achievement sets a new yardstick for younger generation of scholars. It is truly heartening to read articles by so many young scholars, and I must appreciate the editors for having given platform to them, he said. He further highlighted the importance of Archaeological sites in teaching the younger generation about the great heritage, archeological skills, diverse culture and tradition of the country.

The Vice President urged upon the Ministry of Culture to highlight and promote them as tourist attractions and make visitors aware of the great antiquity of our nation and Delhi. He also wanted the administrators to develop them as Archaeology Parks to showcase the antiquity of the regions. He also wanted them to make use of modern technology to create Archaeology Park experiences for public.  

Shri Naidu said that efforts should be made to nourish the young talent by providing them research facilities, financial support and also by platforms to publish their articles and research papers on ancient Indian traditions, culture. Compiling and consolidating academic research would help the current and future generations, to understand the history, he opined. 

Shri Naidu opined that books such as the one released, highlights the significance of nourishing ancient India’s civilization apart from honoring stalwarts like Padma Bhushan Prof B.B. Lal, whose contribution has been important in unearthing some of the most significant landmarks of India’s ancient History and Culture.

Leading Archaeologists, Historians and scholars of Ancient Indian Civilization and Culture were present at the venue.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It gives me great pleasure to be amongst the leading Archaeologists, Historians and scholars of Ancient Indian Civilization and Culture.

I need not dwell upon the importance of archaeology in deciphering the past in terms of history, culture and the ways of living as all of you are experts.

I am delighted to release the three-volume book – Felicitating a Legendary Archaeologist B.B.Lal, edited by eminent archaeologist, Dr B.R. Mani, Air Vice Marshal (retd.) Rajesh Lal, Ms. Neera Misra, Chairperson-Trustee of the Draupadi Dream Trust and Dr Vinay Kumar, Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Banaras Hindu University.

As I learn, this book is an effort to highlight the significance of nourishing ancient  India’s civilization and honor one of the tallest archaeologists of today, Padma Bhushan Prof B.B. Lal, whose contribution has been important in unearthing some of the most significant landmarks of India’s ancient History and Culture.

I understand that Prof. Lal, commencing with the excavations from the Harappa days in 1946, has completed 73 continuous years of research and writing on Archaeology and in recognition of his work, it was decided to bring out this Felicitation Volume to honor his services for the cause of archaeology. We normally see holding of felicitation functions, but paying tribute to the body of work of Prof. Lal through a book is something unique and truly laudable. 

Divided into three volumes, the first covers Prof Lal’s writings that include the books he has authored and a list of seminal articles with peer reviews of his works. This volume also provides glimpses into his personal life as well as contribution from some of the well-known personalities highlighting their inter-personal relationships with the archaeologist.

The second and third volumes contain contributions from 37 national and international scholars, covering a very wide range of subjects – from Stone Age to Medieval temples and paintings. Significantly, while throwing light on his remarkable journey in explorations, excavations and findings at some of the landmark sites of our civilization, it transports us into the deep roots of our civilization and culture going back to 6-7 millennia BCE. As we get acquainted with Prof Lal’s achievements, we also see the depths of our own civilization, giving us a feeling of pride in our ancient glory and prosperity.

Quite a few of the contributors are world-renowned while there are others whose papers will be read with immense interest. The articles in these volumes highlight the heritage of ancient Indian Civilization and Culture. The research work of the scholars needs to be highlighted.

Indeed, all papers provide a wealth of knowledge. I am sure that the book will not only find a place in libraries, but will also be read by everybody interested in ancient India. It is hoped that the papers will encourage inter-disciplinary awareness and exchange of views within the scholarly community as also among the general readers. Research is an ongoing quest for knowledge and every achievement sets a new yardstick for younger generation of scholars.

It is truly heartening to read articles by so many young scholars, and I must appreciate the editors for having given platform to them. Our effort must continue to nourish such talent and continue the ancient tradition of ‘knowledge samhita’ by compiling and consolidating academic research for current and future generations.

The three volumes are a tribute to the spirit and dedication of a 98-year-old learner and documenter, who has set highest standards in scholarly pursuits. Although an exhaustive knowledge tome for the archeologists and historians, the book indeed is an equal delight for an average individual interested in pursuit of historical knowledge.

Professor Lal’s excavations cover a wide range -- from Paleolithic times to early historical. At Kalibangan, Rajasthan, he unearthed a prosperous city of the Harappan Civilization documenting the civilizational period of Early and Mature Harappan. The excavations revealed the earliest agricultural field and the earliest earthquake anywhere in the world.

He has also been instrumental in excavating sites connected with the Mahabharata, mainly, Hastināpura and Indraprastha, and that of the Ramayana which included a site at Ayodhaya. The excavations relating to the Mahabharata sites have established that there was a kernel of truth in the Mahābhārata, even though the epic may be considered by some to be full of interpolations.

His identification of Purana Qila as core of Indraprastha, one of the five villages that the Pandavas got, takes the antiquity of Delhi back to much more than the idea of just about 1000 BCE. I most certainly hope that the Archaeological Survey of India is maintaining the sites of Kalibangan and that of Indraprastha. These landmark sites should be exposed and conserved as Archaeology Parks, under proper protected cover, to showcase the actual antiquity of the regions. Modern construction technology provides many possibilities to create open Archaeology Park experiences for public to know and get acquainted with our ancient past.

I also call upon the Ministry of Culture to highlight these Archaeological sites as tourist attractions and make the visitors aware of the great antiquity of our nation and Delhi.

In his book, The Rigvedic People, he comes to the conclusion that the Harappan Civilization, also referred to as the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, was occupied by the Rigvedic people and that there was never any invasion or immigration from the West.

Professor Lal has many awards to his credit. To name a few, he is a recipient of two Honorary D. Litts, has been honored with titles of Mahamahopadhyaya and Vidyavaridhi and was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the year 2000. His work stands out as an example to young scholars on the opportunities in the field of archaeology. I wish Prof Lal good health and hope that he would continue to mentor and be the leading light to all five generations of archaeologists.

I must also laud the dedicated efforts of the Draupadi Dream Trust, especially Ms Neera Misra, in collecting some of the best minds together to compile this outstanding treatise on Bharata civilization.

I am pleased to learn that this Trust derives its name and inspiration from the historical and iconic Draupadi, mentioned as one of the revered Panch-kanya of ancient Bharata, the much worshipped Draupadi Amman of South India.

The able guidance of eminent scholar Dr B.R.Mani must have been equally noteworthy in the making of this significant work. I must also laud the efforts of Air Vice Marshal (retd) Rajesh Lal and scholar, Dr.Vinay Kumar in bringing out this important book.

I heartily congratulate all the Editors and contributors for published this ‘samhita of ancient knowledge’.

The presence of this august gathering of archaeologists, historians and scholars of various fields makes this occasion a very special one, and I am really happy to have this opportunity to be with you all today to celebrate and do my bit in nourishing the roots of ancient India by releasing this book.

I thank the organizers, editors and all participants here and wish them all success in their pursuit of knowledge.

Thank You

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has advised the media to present a report card on the performance of parties in an objective manner to enable people make an informed choice during elections. 

 

Delivering the first ‘Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture’, here today, organized by Indian Institute of Mass Communication on “Role of media in moulding enlightened electorate”, the Vice President opined that if the media can present report card and the people can demand accountability from political parties vis-a-vis their promises, raising resources and how they intend to spend them, he said “our  country can boast of not only being the largest democracy in the world but also one of the most vibrant, cleanest democracies in the world”.

 

Shri Naidu said that media should act as a mirror that reflects the reality, neither magnifying nor diminishing, neither distorting nor mystifying facts. Expressing his concern over the “evil of paid news”, the Vice President advised the media to “shun this tendency lest 'money power' is used to influence voters through 'manufactured' views and opinions of paid news”.

 

The Vice President wanted the media to analyze the issues and challenges before the electorate instead of resorting to agenda - setting and taking sides.

 

The Vice President called upon the media to dispel rumors propagated by different political outfits and put a full stop to fake news by presenting the right facts before their readers and viewers. He said facts that were sacred and must be presented in an unbiased manner and opinion must be left to people.

 

Observing that media has an important role in promoting voter turnout for a democracy, Shri Naidu said that to make elections more credible and inclusive the pitfalls such as money and muscle power, breaching the limits of election expenditure, invoking caste and religion, criminal antecedents of candidates, paid news and fake news, violating the Model Code of Conduct, inadequate representation of women in legislatures need to be addressed in quick time.

 

Referring to the efforts of Election Commission of India to combat fake news, Shri Naidu said that media’s role was extremely important during elections as the chances of people propagating fake-news increases. “It is the responsibility of media to act like myth-busters in such sensitive times, and report the absolute, undiluted truth,” he added.

 

Asserting that the quality of electoral process was the touch stone of healthy democracy, the Vice President said that unbiased media ensures that the electorate was well informed about the choices.

 

Opining that the tendency of media to add commentary to facts could be dangerous for democracy, he said “As an old saying goes 'facts are sacred and opinion is free'. So stick to facts, present them fearlessly and give opinions fearlessly but when giving opinion don't 'change' the facts”, he added.

 

Expressing his concern over the unhealthy trend of politicians switching from one party to other after being elected, Shri Naidu opined that defections were making mockery of the democracy. He said that defectors must resign to the post and seek re election. The Vice President also stressed up on the need for a speedy disposal of election cases pending before various courts. He also wanted a time bound disposal of cases by the presiding officers of the legislative bodies.

 

Shri Naidu asked media organisations to devote space and time to report on the antecedents of politicians, their past work, participation in debates in state legislatures and Parliament.

 

The Vice President asked people to elect leaders based on their Character, Caliber, Capacity and Conduct but said some people were trying to replace these qualities with Cash, Community, Caste and Criminality. “We must foresee that these 4C’s are coming and must be careful”, he cautioned.

 

The Vice President bemoaned the falling level of public discourse and wanted the quality of debates to be raised.   

 

The Chairman of Prasar Bharati, Dr. A. Surya Prakash, the Director General of IIMC, Shri K.G Suresh, faculty and students of the institute were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s Lecture:

 

“Dear Sisters and brothers,  

 

यह मेरा सौभाग्य है कि आपने मुझे प्रथम अटल बिहारी वाजपई स्मृति व्याख्यान देने के लिए आमंत्रित किया। वाजपई जी की गणना आजाद भारत के सर्वोच्च राजनेताओं में होती है। उन्होंने देश में संपर्क क्रांति का सूत्रपात किया। उन्होंने लोगों को एकजुट किया, वे शहरों और गांवों को समीप लाए, राजनैतिक दलों को साथ लाए। वे ओजस्वी वक्ता थे, संवाद स्थापित करने में निपुण। भाषा पर उनकी पकड़, उनका शब्द शिल्प श्रोताओं को मंत्रमुग्ध कर देता था।

 

वे कवि हृदय थे लेकिन साथ ही सिद्धांतों पर निष्ठ, मंजे हुए अनुभवी राजनेता भी थे। आज इस अवसर पर यह याद रखना प्रासंगिक होगा कि राजनीति में कदम रखने से पहले, अटल जी ने अपना कैरियर एक पत्रकार लेखक के रूप में प्रारंभ किया था।

 

आपने जिस विषय पर मुझे बोलने का अवसर दिया है वह आज के संदर्भ में वास्तव में बहुत प्रासंगिक है। लोकतंत्र का महान पर्व कुछ ही हफ्ते दूर है और मीडिया इस उत्सव के हर पहलू को कवर करने के लिए तत्पर है। साथ ही नकली/फेक न्यूज जैसी कुप्रवृत्ति के प्रति आगाह किया जा रहा है। अभी कल ही चुनाव आयोग ने मीडिया में अाई इस कुरीति की रोकथाम के लिए एक बैठक बुलाई थी।

 

देश में लोकतंत्र की जड़े मजबूत करने में मीडिया की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका पर आपसे अपने विचार साझा करने में मुझे हर्ष होगा।

I deem it a privilege to deliver this first Atal Behari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture. 

Atal ji was indeed a great democrat and his contributions to enriching the democratic spirit of the country has very few parallels. His contributions as an outstanding Parliamentarian to enriching the democratic discourse is indeed legendary. 

Vajpayeeji has been one of the tallest leaders of post-independence India who ushered in a connectivity revolution in the country. He brought people together, villages and cities together and political parties together. He was a master communicator whose mastery over language left audiences spell bound. He was the architect of telecommunication revolution as well. It is incumbent on all of us to carry forward his legacy. That is the best tribute we can pay to him.

He was a poet at heart and an astute statesman par excellence. What is quite relevant to remember today is the fact that he started his career as a journalist before he entered politics. He retained that rare ability to connect and communicate all through his life – traits that will undoubtedly inspire young journalists. 

Sisters & brothers!

The theme you have asked me to speak on is also quite topical. The great festival of democracy, 17th Lok Sabha along with a few assembly polls is a few weeks away and the media is fully geared up to capture this festival’s different facets.

Democracy in simpler terms is a political system in which the people elect their government and hold it accountable through legislatures. In other worlds, the people are the masters of their destiny. Elections are the bedrock of democracy. A thriving and vibrant electoral democracy has been India’s distinct and durable entity, long before it asserted itself as an economic, nuclear and IT power. Universal adult suffrage that we adopted soon after Independence is a giant leap forward, a bold enterprise and an unparalleled adventure.

Participatory democracy is only possible through the active participation of citizens. Elections are sacred expression of citizenship. Voting is a national call of duty. The right to vote needs to be accompanied by the sacred responsibility of exercising that precious right. Voting in every election needs to be made a habit. Media has an important role in promoting participatory democracy through enhanced voter turnout which in turn broad bases the foundation of democratic governance. 

Decades of democracy in our country has ushered in social changes by giving voice to the voice less.

Anthropological perspective of democracy says electoral campaign is a pilgrimage manifesting the ‘inversion of power from the hands of politicians back to the hands of voters. With elections as its central and regular ritual enactment, democracy helps maintain and restore equilibrium. Taking this ritual as the central metaphor, anthropological studies approach electoral process as a series of ‘ceremonies and performances’.

An election is a celebration in two ways. It is a festive social event and it also involves a sense of democracy as sacred and therefore, elections are sacred expression of citizenship. 

Sisters & brothers

Media has an important role in promoting awareness about voting and to increase the voter participation for a meaningful democracy which is all about informed exercise of choice and expression of opinions in our collective endeavor to sculpture a better future. 

Let us now look at the voter participation in general elections since 1952. At the time of Independence, only about 16% of our population was literate. With 17.30 cr voters for the first general elections in 1952, the voter turnout was about 45%. Since then, there has been a 500% increase in both the size of the electorate and literacy but the voter turnout has increased by only about 50% in the general elections for the 16th Lok Sabha in 2014. In the last 16 general elections, voter turnout has been lesser than 60% on ten occasions and more than 60% six times. With persistent efforts of the Election Commission of India, voter turnout was 66.30% in 2014, the highest since Independence. This is low but given the decline in voter interest in some societies, it is still better.

Issues of social, political and economic exclusion need to be addressed to ensure robust, confident, informed and ethical electoral participation for enriching democracy. 

Sisters & brothers!

Use of money and muscle power, breaching the limits of election expenditure, invoking caste and religion, criminal antecedents of candidates, paid news and fake news, violating the norms of level playing field, violating the Model Code of Conduct, inadequate representation of women in legislatures are among the major pitfalls of our democracy and need to be addressed in quick time to make our elections more credible and inclusive. 

There is also an effort to combat the menace of ‘fake news’ and it was only yesterday that the Election Commission had held a meeting to evolve a strategy to curb this distortion by media. 

I am happy to share with you some thoughts on the role of media within the context of deepening our democratic roots. 

Free media is the Cornerstone of Democracy.

India, being the world’s largest democracy, the role of media becomes all the more important. Media can actually be a force multiplier to sustain democracy. 

Media is rightly called the ‘fourth pillar’ of democracy as it is the bridge between the people and the other three pillars of Legislature, Judiciary and Executive. 

One of the fundamental aims of democratic elections all over the world is to provide electorate with an opportunity to exercise their political rights and vote for the political parties and candidates of their choice. 

A meaningful way for exercising this choice requires, among other things:

1.    A free and fair media that can report on the politics of the day in an unbiased manner.

2.    An examination of the political agenda and platforms of different parties and their candidates—providing information about their intentions, policies, vision, corruption scandals, the impact of their policies on the country and its citizens

3.    Ability to publish these views via different media formats like online news, newspapers and television

4.    An informed citizenry that respects facts, and is open to reasoning, logic, love for country and respects its ethos. 

Media assumes a crucial role when elections are concerned and there is a need to link the citizenry of approximately 1.35 Billion people. 

Media role is very important, especially during the elections, the chances of people propagating fake-news increases. It is the responsibility of media to act like myth-busters in such sensitive times, and report the absolute, undiluted truth. 

Media has to ensure that the public has access to all the information that they need to make an educated and informed decision. 

The Representation of Peoples Act lays down the ground rules related to the conduct of elections in India. Every media professional who does election reporting must know the relevant provisions of the act. Media can greatly contribute in the swift and effective conduct of elections in the country. 

Over the last few years, the media has come under serious attack in the country- for its biased role, publication of fake news, pushing the agenda of special interest groups like corporates, NGOs, ideologies and foreign companies- raising serious questions regarding the media impartiality and objectivity. 

Paid news is a matter of concern. Reporting is no longer perceived to be objective and the media somewhere fails to fulfill the basic requirements of good journalism in the present scenario. But there are many good media houses, which play the crucial role in highlighting local, regional and national problems as well as positive developments. 

The quality of electoral processes is the touchstone of a healthy democracy. An unbiased media ensures that the electorate is well informed about the choices. 

The tendency of media to add commentary to facts can be dangerous for democracy. As an old saying goes 'facts are sacred and opinion is free'. So stick to facts, present them fearlessly. Give opinions fearlessly but when giving opinion don't 'change' the facts. 

The media universe is fast expanding with the explosion of social and new media – such as social media sites, blogs, email and other new media platforms – has changed the role media play in elections, with unprecedented opportunities for two-way dialogue and interaction.

But this explosion is bringing in its wake certain serious challenges, primarily in the form of it’s misuse and abuse.

While the emergence of social media has ‘decentralised and democratized’ the  flow of information and views, it’s potential degeneration has serious implications for democratic spirit and values. It should not be allowed to derail the democratic process at the time of elections. 

Media can dispel rumours and fact check on fake social media narratives which, if unchecked, can lead to social disharmony and unrest. However, what poses a challenge before social media is the rampant spread of hate speech as elections draw closer. Media should play a responsible role in disseminating correct and unbiased information to its citizens. 

Fake news has become a major issue that media all over the world is waging a war against. The trend sees a hike in the sensitive election environment when political parties try to tilt the narrative in their favour. While steps have been taken by Google news initiative, WhatsApp and Facebook in their capacity to curb the menace, efforts have to be made by traditional media as well to ensure that nothing but credible information is conveyed to people. 

As a recent Supreme Court judgement notes, “The media is the watchdog of the constitution”. Media’s role as a watchdog is perhaps its most defining characteristic apart from its obvious role as an information disseminator. 

The evil of paid news has been addressed by the Election Commission. Media has to shun this tendency lest 'money power' is used to influence voters through 'manufactured' views and opinions of paid news. 

Media should play an objective role. It should highlight and analyse the issues and challenges before the electorate instead of resorting to agenda setting and taking sides.

One of the most important factors that guide the independence and the watchdog role of the media is the ownership patterns that the media house falls under. 

The last few decades have witnessed the expansion of large media conglomerates owning a wide range of media along with expansion into other business ventures. 

The greatest threat to media independence, however, comes from direct political ownership of the media houses. 

Earlier people used to say about Media& Politicians, they have a “Mission” to serve. Now people sarcastically say few among them converted it means for “Commission”.

If people can choose the candidates on the basis of 4 ‘C’s- Character, Caliber, Capacity and Conduct, if the voters are not led astray by considerations like ‘Caste’, ‘Community’, ‘Cash’ and ‘Criminality’, and media can present the profile of contesting candidates with all antecedents, our democracy will gain in strength. 

If media can present the report card of the performance of parties in an objective manner, if people can demand accountability from political parties on how far they had fulfilled their past promises, how they raise resources, how they spend them, our country can boast of not only being the largest democracy in the world by also one of the most vibrant, cleanest democracies in the world. 

That’s the role media should play. It should be a mirror that reflects the reality, neither magnifying nor diminishing, neither distorting nor mystifying facts.

 

मीडिया को इस भूमिका का निर्वाह करना है। वो एक दर्पण है जो सच्चाई को यथावत प्रतिबिंबित करता है, न बढ़ा चढ़ा कर, न कमतर कर के, न ही तोड़ मरोड़ कर और न तथ्यों को गोपनीय बना कर। प्रेस की आजादी लोकतंत्र के लिए आवश्यक है, लेकिन इस आज़ादी के साथ भारी ज़िम्मेदारी भी है। सत्य, सौहार्द, खुशहाली, सुशासन - भारत इन मूलभूत सिद्धांतों का सदैव पक्षधर रहा है। अपने इन्हीं मूल्यों के कारण वाजपई जी जाने जाते थे। सबके लिए प्रिय तथा आदरणीय थे।

 

मैं आशा करता हूं कि भारतीय जनसंचार संस्थान युवा पत्रकारों में इन मूल्यों को स्थापित करेगा। आप युवा पत्रकारों का एक ऐसा वर्ग बना सकेंगे जो अपनी कलम का प्रयोग एक बेहतर राजनीति को स्थापित करने के लिए करेंगे, लोकतांत्रिक शासन और अंततः एक बेहतर विश्व के निर्माण के पक्ष में करेंगे।

A free press is essential for sustaining democracy but that freedom comes with a tremendous sense of responsibility, a sublime mission to promote values like truth, happiness, harmony, good governance – all essential values that India has traditionally stood for and those for which Vajypayeeji is known for. 

I hope the Indian Institute of Mass Communication will instill these concepts in young journalists and create a new cadre of journalists who wield the pen masterfully to create a better polity, a people-centric, development-oriented, democratic governance and ultimately, a better world. 

Thank you

 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has underscored India’s stand as a peace loving nation but determined to combat terror in all its forms and manifestations. He was interacting with the Vice President of Ghana, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the Prime Minister of Guinea, Dr. Ibrahima Kassory Fofana and the Deputy Prime Minister of Lesotho, Mr. Monyane Moleleki, who called on him, at his residence here today. The Spouse of the Vice President, Smt. Usha Naidu and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President welcomed the dignitaries with Anga Vastrams (traditional Indian attire) and Smt. Usha Naidu offered traditional Shawls to the spouses of the visiting dignitaries.

At the luncheon meeting hosted by the Vice President of India, the leaders shared their happiness at the traditionally close ties between their countries with India, underpinned by shared vision and values of peaceful co-existence and natural respect, democracy and rule of law.

Shri Naidu said that noted with satisfaction that there was strong economic co-operation between the countries and that all countries were growing at a fast pace. He further observed that each of our countries has natural, financial and human resources and that we have to tap into our material resources, enrich our human resources and transform our economies through partnership.

Recounting a number of high level visits between India and these countries including President of Ghana’s visit to India last year for the founding conference of International Solar Alliance; President of India’s visit to Ghana in 2016; the President of Guinea’s visit to India in 2015; His Majesty King Let Sie-III King of Lesotho’s visit in December, 2017 and of Prime Minister of Lesotho in 2018, the Vice President desired that these high level visits deepen our mutual ties and must continue. In this connection, he mentioned the possibility of his own State visit to Lesotho later this year.

He expressed pleasure that quite a few collaborative projects have been completed like the work on the Tema-Akosombo railway line has started (approx 400 Million USD) and India-Ghana Kofi Annan Centre ($ 2.86 million) set up training 20,000 students for excellence in IT in Ghana and India-Lesotho Centre for Advanced Information Technology started in 2017. He reiterated India’s support for electricity, hospitals, transportation – as well as in telemedicine (e-Arogya Bharati) and digital learning (e-Vidya-Bharati) in Guinea.

“There is immense scope for further enhancing bilateral trade and commercial cooperation between our countries”, he added.

The Vice President expressed the hope that in all our countries, we would be able to translate economic growth into inclusive, sustainable development and referred to Indian government’s resolve to transform governance and ultimately the lives of the people.

Shri Naidu thanked the leaders for their support to India in international forums, especially on the issue of India’s non-permanent membership of UNSC for 2020-21 and various candidatures in other UN bodies and stressed the need for democratizing UNSC as wells as by including India as member.

The Vice President highlighted the rising tide of terrorist violence across the globe including the recent incidents of Pulwama, Christchurch and Utrecht. He underscored India’s stand as a peace loving nation but determined to combat terror in all its forms and manifestations. The Vice President explained the recent preemptive counter terror air strikes by India

All the three leaders expressed unequivocal support to India’s actions and condemned the brutal assault at Pulwama. They reaffirmed their commitment to combat the menace and stated that even the African Union has taken a considered position against terror.

The Vice President hosted a traditional Indian Lunch along with Smt. Usha Naidu to those dignitaries and their delegations at the Vice President’s house.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India is respected and regarded world over for its age-old values of peace and harmony embedded in its philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.

Speaking at a felicitation function organized by the committee of Friends and Well Wishers, in Hyderabad today, following the conferment of Doctor Honoris Causa upon him by the Peace University of Costa Rica in recognition of his contribution to the rule of law, democracy, sustainable development and peace, the Vice President said that the horrific shooting of defenceless worshippers in New Zealand once again highlighted the need for all countries to come together to eliminate the scourge of terrorism. “It is a global challenge which requires a global response. No country is immune to these threats”, he added.

Pointing out that India had been victim of mindless violence and facing the menace of cross-border terrorism for the past many decades, he expressed his disappointment over China’s decision to block the proposal of UN Security Council to list Jaish-e-Mohammed Chief, Azhar Mahmood as a global terrorist. “This once again underlines the need for expanding the Security Council”, he added.

The Vice President wished that he would undertake a nationwide campaign to promote peace; strengthen democracy, fight corruption, create greater awareness on sustainable development and encourage social harmony through various forums across the nation. 

Shri Naidu said that the quest for industrialization and modernization has pushed the atmospheric carbon dioxide to dangerous levels leading to climate disruption and global warming.

Quoting the latest report of Global Environment Outlook which mentioned that poor environmental conditions were causing about 25 per cent of global diseases and mortality - around 9 million deaths in 2015 alone, the Vice President said “all of us must strive to protect environment, reduce pollution, promote greenery, conserve water bodies and ensure that development does not disrupt natural resources”.

Referring to the conferment of the Honorary Doctorate, she Naidu said it was not for an individual, but reflected the global acknowledgement and recognition of the age-old Indian values of peace and harmony embedded in our philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

""I am grateful to all of you for felicitating me upon the conferment of Doctor Honoris Causa by the University for Peace based in Costa Rica in recognition of my contribution to the rule of law, democracy, sustainable development and peace.

I am of the opinion that the Doctorate conferred upon me is not for an individual but reflects the global acknowledgement and recognition of the age-old Indian values of peace and harmony embedded in our philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. I felt doubly honored that it was given at a time when the world is commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, who had demonstrated to the world the power of non-violence

Dear friends, our quest for industrialization and modernization has pushed the atmospheric carbon dioxide to dangerous levels leading to climate disruption and global warming. We have to reverse this trend urgently. Words like sustainable development and peace might sound esoteric and far removed to you. Please remember that you are contributing to green house gas emissions when you switch on your air conditioner. Similarly, you are aiding global warming when you switch on the ignition of your car.

Only the other day, the latest Global Environment Outlook report has mentioned that poor environmental conditions were causing about 25 per cent of global diseases and mortality—around 9 million deaths in 2015 alone.

All of us must strive to protect environment, reduce pollution, promote greenery, conserve water bodies and ensure that development does not disrupt natural resources. Please remember that all of us have an onerous responsibility cast on us to make this planet greener and safer so that the lives of future generations are not jeopardized.

As regards peace, I have always maintained that peace is the foremost prerequisite for progress. Any kind of conflict or strife will prevent development. I have been consistently saying that one cannot pay attention to development if there is tension. Again, it is the duty of every citizen to ensure that the social harmony in our country is not disturbed in any way.

On the external front, India has been facing the menace of cross-border terrorism and has been a victim of mindless violence for the past many decades. Terrorism can never be treated with kid gloves. The horrific shooting of defenceless worshippers in New Zealand once again underscored the need for all countries to come together to eliminate the scourge of terrorism.

It is truly disappointing that China has once again blocked the proposal of UN Security Council to list Jaish-e-Mohammed Chief, Azhar Mahmood as global terrorist. This once again underlines the need for expanding the Security Council.

The time has come for the UN to speedily conclude the deliberations on the proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, which was proposed by India at the UN in 1996 and is pending since then.

India has been a votary of peace and non-violence from time immemorial. We wish to have cordial relations with all countries and peoples around the world. But peace will not thrive if the forces of terror continue their unchecked run.

The harsh reality today is that terrorism is raising its ugly head in different parts of the world. It is a global challenge which requires a global response. No country is immune to these threats.

The world community must rally behind the forces of peace to quell the forces of terrorism.

The United Nations should evolve a common strategy to combat these forces.

Friends, I have also decided to launch a nationwide campaign to promote rule of law and peace; strengthen democracy, fight corruption, create greater awareness on sustainable development and encourage social harmony.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that world class drugs with unwavering quality at very affordable prices is the need of hour. He urged the Indian Pharmaceutical industry to remain committed to high standards of quality in drug manufacturing and quality frameworks. Calling for strict adherence to global standards in manufacturing drugs, he exhorted the industry to earmark more resources for discovering new molecules and new drugs without compromising on the affordability of drugs.

Addressing the 2nd decennial celebrations of Sarojini Naidu Vanita Pharmacy Maha Vidyalaya, in Hyderabad today, Shri Naidu stressed the need to give a thrust to research and innovation. New healthcare challenges are emerging every day, especially with an alarming rise in the number of non communicable and lifestyle diseases and cancers, he added.

The Vice President said that India had become the largest provider of generic drugs globally and in supplying anti-retroviral drugs used worldwide to combat AIDS .

Shri Naidu lauded the yeomen service rendered by Indian companies in providing life saving medicines at affordable prices in the developing countries.

Expressing his desire to see India emerge as the world leader in generic medicines, Shri Naidu wanted the young researchers to also work towards standardizing and benchmarking Indian systems of medicine. He wanted them to use globally established experimental protocols, to establish the efficiency, validity and efficacy of the traditional medicines.

Shri Naidu asked the Pharma companies to develop new molecules and drugs to combat some of the lesser known diseases, particularly the group of diseases called as “rare diseases”.

Saying that the number of people suffering from rare diseases was estimated to be more than 70 million in India, the Vice President said that it was important for the Indian Pharma industry to look into the need for developing low-cost drugs for treating rare diseases.

The Vice President speedy introduction of generic drugs into the market should remain the focus. Rural health programmes, lifesaving drugs and preventive vaccines should also receive attention from policy makers and Pharma companies alike, he added.

Shri Naidu also called for revamping pharmacy education in India and to bring it on par with global standards for providing a better tomorrow to our youngsters.

Saying that Pharma industry has been posting a robust growth over the last few years, the Vice President said that the industry was projected to grow to US $55 Billion by 2020. He called up on the industry, governments at state and centre to utilize the industry’s growth potential to create job opportunities for youth.

Shri Naidu opined that the Pharmaceutical sector has the crucial responsibility of saving human lives and Pharma companies must go above and beyond their CSR mandates to provide life saving and other essential drugs to those who cannot afford them.

The Vice President complimented the Exhibition Society which is doing great service in the field of education by establishing 18 educational institutions starting from school to post graduate to professional courses with special emphasis on girls education for past 75 years in Telangana with an enrollment of 30,000 students. He also presented Gold Medals to 10 meritorious students.

The Chairman of Sarojini Naidu Vanita Pharmacy Maha Vidyalaya, Shri V. Veerender, the Honorary Secretary, Shri R. Sukesh Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am pleased to be here for the second decennial celebrations of Sarojini Naidu Vanita Pharmacy Maha Vidyalaya. 

At the outset, I would like to compliment the Exhibition Society for promoting girls’ education through an array of 18 educational institutions located across Telangana with an enrollment of 30,000 students. From primary and secondary education to post-graduation, these institutions are imparting education in diverse disciplines like life sciences, humanities, pharmacy and commerce.


India has undertaken a long and arduous, yet rewarding journey in Pharmacology, from the “Charak Samhita” of traditional Indian medicine system, to becoming the third largest drug manufacturer in the world, in terms of volume, in the field of modern medicine.

From the ancient times India had a very systematic, scientific and rational approach to the treatment of diseases. The Atharva veda is a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom in the field of medicine. It is lauded as the earliest source of medical information in India. Ayurveda has been regarded as an upaveda or a subtext of the Atharvaveda.

The mantras in the ancient texts contain a wealth of information regarding herbs, metals, medicines, diseases and treatments. They speak of the astounding properties and powers that herbs and plants possess to cure diseases.

Sisters and Brothers,

Maintaining its legacy of being a pioneer in the field of pharmacology, India today enjoys the exalted position of being the ‘Pharmacy to the world’.

The Pharma industry has posted a robust, double-digit growth over the last few years. The industry was worth US $36.7 Billion in 2017 and is projected to grow to US $55 Billion by 2020.

It is quite heartening to note that the Pharma sector is out-performing most other sectors in achieving consistently high growth. 


The pharma exports stood at $ 17.27 billion in 2017-18. While India is exporting to over 200 countries, the major market, however, is the USA. India is the largest provider of generic drugs globally and 80 per cent of the anti-retroviral drugs used worldwide to combat AIDS are supplied by Indian pharma companies.


Thus, India is rendering a yeoman service in developing countries by providing access to life saving medicines at affordable prices. With Indian companies producing the drugs at economical rates, the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment has gone down from $ 12,000 to $400 per year. 

I was informed that over 65 per cent of the WHO’s demand for DPT and BCG vaccines and 90 per cent measles vaccine are supplied by India. Thus, India’s contribution to global healthcare has been spectacular.

Dear students, there is immense scope for technology, innovation and research in pharmaceuticals. We have the second highest number of US FDA approved facilities. A major advantage for India is the significantly lower labour costs when compared with than other countries.

The government has introduced a range of fiscal incentives to promote domestic manufacturing.

Providing essential drugs and medicines at cost-effective prices is the key focus of Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. The government and the Pharma sector must act in unison to effectively harness the power of Information technology to improve efficiency.

‘Pharma Jan Samadhan’, a customer grievances redressal system was launched and a mobile application – ‘Pharma Sahi Daam’ that provides real-time information to consumers on prices of Scheduled/Non-scheduled medicines has also been introduced.

Sisters and brothers,

Quality medicines, surgicals and consumables are now available at affordable prices to the poor and disadvantaged sections through the “Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan aushadhi Kendras”. 

I would like to see India emerge as the world leader in generic medicines. At the same time, we should not hesitate to promote Indian systems of medicine. 

I urge young researchers to work towards standardizing and benchmarking Indian systems of medicine. Using globally established experimental protocols, you must establish the efficiency, validity and efficacy of the traditional medicines. 

Speedy introduction of generic drugs into the market should remain the focus. Rural health programmes, lifesaving drugs and preventive vaccines should also receive attention from policy makers and Pharma companies alike.

There should be an unwavering commitment to high standards of quality in drug manufacturing and quality frameworks such as Good Manufacturing Practices should strictly be adhered to.

There should also be a thrust on research and innovation. New healthcare challenges are emerging every day, especially with the alarming rise in the number of non communicable and lifestyle diseases and cancers.

New molecules and new drugs will have to be discovered and treatment protocols will have to be continuously upgraded and updated.

All this will have to be achieved without compromising on the affordability of drugs. Pharmaceutical sector has the crucial responsibility of saving human lives. Pharma companies should go above and beyond their CSR mandates to provide life saving and other essential drugs to those who cannot afford them.


While major multinationals and pharma companies will be interested in producing and selling drugs that cater to common and chronic diseases affecting larger populations, there is a need to develop new molecules and drugs to combat some of the lesser known diseases, particularly the group of diseases called as “rare diseases”.

In India the number of people suffering from rare diseases is estimated to be more than 70 million. While it is estimated that there are around 7,000 rare diseases in the world, majority of diseases have no treatment and the costs are prohibitively expensive in cases where they are available. It is, therefore, important for the Indian pharma industry to look into the need for developing low-cost drugs for treating rare diseases.   

In view of the initiatives taken to promote the pharmaceutical sector in the country, I am confident that the goal to make India a global leader in end-to-end drug manufacture would be achieved in the coming years. The plan to start a single window facility for approvals and consents augurs well for the pharma industry.

Friends, although the intake of pharmacy students has improved substantially in view of the drastic increase in the number of pharmacy colleges in the country, the need of the hour is to revamp the pharmacy education in India and bring it on par with global standards. To make this happen, the industry and academia need to come onto a single platform for providing a better tomorrow to our youngsters.

I am happy to note that the Exhibition Society is running one of the state-of-art Pharmacy colleges in the country by offering quality education. My best wishes to all the students for a bright and successful careers ahead!

Thank you, Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that concerted efforts are required from every stakeholder to ensure that there is no agrarian distress in the country.

He was addressing the gathering at an interactive meet of farmers and scientists organised by Swarna Bharat Trust in association with Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University, in Swarna Bharat Trust, Atkur, Vijayawada today.

The Vice President said that the foremost need in the country is to double the income of the farmers by making agriculture resilient, sustainable and profitable. “We need to introduce structural changes and both the Centre and various States need to accord the highest priority to this aspect”, he added.

Emphasizing upon  the important role played by infrastructure empowering the farmers, the Vice President said that improving rural road connectivity, setting up more godowns, cold storage facilities, ensuring assured water and electricity supply are some of the key measures which have to be implemented. Providing timely credit to farmers is equally important, he added.

Shri Naidu said that the farmers should also be educated on the need to diversify crops and take up allied farm activities. A study by MANAGE has revealed that there were no suicides in the families of farmers, who took up allied activities, he pointed out.

The Vice President said that the agriculture sector needs a big push in India and in other parts of the world. It is obvious that a concerted, coordinated action is needed on a number of issues that impact the growth of agriculture sector and the quality of life of people who depend primarily on this sector, he said. The Government, Private Sector, Agricultural Universities, KVKs, Scientists and farmers must come together and address the pressing issues of farmers, he added.

 

Shri Naidu said that irrigation, infrastructure, investment and insurance sectors need to be strengthened to support farmers. We need a multi-pronged approach to address the complex interrelated issues in current agriculture scenario, he added.

Earlier, the Vice President inaugurated an Exhibition on Agriculture and went around the same and interacted with the Farmers.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am extremely happy to participate in this interactive meet of farmers and scientists organised by Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University today.

Agriculture is very close to my heart. Farmers and people living in rural areas are always in my mind when I deliberate on any developmental issue. After becoming the Vice President of India, I have been holding national consultations to change the face of agriculture and improve the income of farmers.

Dear friends.

In India, agriculture has traditionally played a vital role in economic development and continues to do so even till this day. Agriculture, along with fisheries and forestry, is one of the largest contributors to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The current challenge is to make it more profitable and ecologically sustainable. Being the second largest country in the world in terms of agricultural output, India must take the lead in reforming the sector.

The foremost need in the country is to double the income of the farmers by making agriculture resilient, sustainable and profitable. We need to introduce structural changes and both the Centre and various States need to accord the highest priority to this aspect. Concerted efforts are required from every stakeholder to ensure that there is no agrarian distress.

Infrastructure development is one of the key factors to improve agriculture sector and empower the farmers. Improving rural road connectivity, setting up more godowns, cold storage facilities, ensuring assured water and electricity supply are some of the key measures which have to be implemented. Providing timely credit to farmers is equally important. Of course, as the economy improves interest rates have to be reduced further. The crop insurance scheme should be made more attractive and implemented effectively.

I have always been stating that loan waivers and providing free power supply are not going to help the farmers in the long run. They provide only short term relief. It should be realized that the farmer does not need freebies but proper marketing conditions to sell his produce. There is a need to remove restrictions on movement of agri produce and free export should be allowed.

The farmers should also be educated on the need to diversify crops and take up allied farm activities. A study by MANAGE has revealed that there were no suicides in the families of farmers, who took up allied activities.

I feel that the farmers should be encouraged to grow horticulture crops as also cultivate cereals and pulses.

The extension officials should be made to spend more time with the farmers. Similarly, it should be made mandatory for students of agriculture to visit fields and stay with the families of agriculturists to understand firsthand the problems of farmers.

Our farmers are not being able to sustain on agriculture as the profession has become non-profitable and non-viable. Non profitability of agriculture often results in financial distress as it increases the debt burden on farmers. It often leads to migration towards urban areas for work and widens the urban rural divide.

Farming or Agriculture contributes about 16% of total GDP and employs nearly 50% of the total workforce in India.

The agriculture sector needs a big push in India and in other parts of the world. It is obvious that a concerted, coordinated action is needed on a number of issues that impact the growth of agriculture sector and the quality of life of people who depend primarily on this sector.

It is a matter of concern that the number of people engaged in agriculture as a percentage of total employment has been steadily going down all over the world. From 43% in 1991, it is now a mere 26% in 2017. In India also, while nearly 64% of the total workforce was engaged in agriculture in 1991, it was down to 44% in 2017.

The Government, Private Sector, Agricultural Universities, KVKs, Scientists and farmers must come together and address the pressing issues of farmers.

We need to have a positive bias in allocating resources to rural areas and help in developing a second income source for those who are solely dependent on agriculture income.

Dear friends, we should also focus on developing climate resilient crops as climate change is impacting every aspect of our life.

Irrigation, infrastructure, investment and Insurance sectors need to be strengthened to support farmers. We need a multi-pronged approach to address the complex interrelated issues in current agriculture scenario.

Jahind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has announced that he would undertake a nationwide campaign on promoting the rule of law, democracy, sustainable development and peace.

 

Speaking at a felicitation function organized at Swarna Bharat Trust, Vijayawada today, following the conferment of Doctor Honoris Causa upon him by the University for Peace of Costa Rica, the Vice President said that he felt doubly honored to receive the honorary doctorate as the world was commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, who had demonstrated to the world the power of non-violence.

 

Emphasizing the need for creating greater awareness among the people on the importance of strengthening the rule of law, eliminating corruption, promoting peace and sustainable development and ending regional and social disparities, Shri Naidu declared that he would take up all these issues as also the need for a united action to stamp out terrorism during his visits to other countries. 

 

Expressing his disappointment over the recent decision of China to block the proposal of the United Nations Security Council to declare Jaish-e-Mohammed Chief, Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, Shri Naidu said it underlined the need for expansion of UN Security Council.

 

The Vice President said that it should be remembered that peace and development are inextricably linked. Peace was the foremost prerequisite for the progress of a nation and the world at large. 

 

Describing the honour conferred upon him by the University for Peace as a global acknowledgement and recognition of the age-old Indian values of peace and harmony embedded in our philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the Vice President said India always believed in peaceful co-existence with all the countries in its neighbourhood.

 

Observing that terrorism was the enemy of humanity and posing a major threat to world peace and development, he pointed out that India had been its victim for many years and called upon all the countries in the world to come together to stamp out the menace of terrorism. The Vice President also urged the United Nations to conclude at the earliest the deliberations on the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for bridging the urban-rural divide and said that Centre and State Governments must accord highest priority for the development of villages and rural areas by creating all the basic amenities.

  Addressing the students of Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT), in Nuzvid, Andhra Pradesh today, he cautioned that it was not good to have two Indias - one comprising developed urban cities and the other backward rural areas. We must remove the Urban-Rural divide, he added. Pointing out that people were migrating to cities for education, enhanced medical facilities and economic activities, he said that the facilities available in urban cities must be provided in rural areas also..

Complimenting the university for imparting high quality technical education to meritorious rural youth, he said education w the main instrument for socio-economic transformation of nation and lays foundation for building a knowledge society. It is important in today’s world for education system to produce holistic individuals, who are committed to strong ethical and moral values, he added.

Shri Naidu said that education means the process by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, and intellect is sharpened, as a result of which one can stand on one’s own feet. True education equips the youth to contribute to the material progress of the country, he added.

Expressing his concern that the present education system was merely producing students with degree certificates rather than individuals with critical analytical skills and innovative thinking, the Vice President said that institutions of higher learning such as RGKUT must prepare a large group of skilled and capable workforce who can drive the economy of the nation and help the nation to deal effectively with various challenges such as agrarian distress, rapid urbanization, growing energy demand, climate change, global warming, urban-rural divide and  economic disparities.

Observing that today’s world was dependent on the competitive use of knowledge and innovation, he urged the students of technology to strive for coming up with practical, low cost solutions to the problems faced by the society. ""Our technocrats need to find indigenous solutions rather than look up to alien concepts and practices. As you all are aware, the sole purpose of Science and Technology is to make the lives of people better, the Vice President added.

Shri Naidu said that despite the advancement in technology and economic progress, a considerable section of our citizenry was still lacking access to essential resources. He advised the students to rise to the occasion and provide solutions to most pressing problems such as ensuring  potable drinking water to every household, eliminating malnutrition and making healthcare affordable and accessible.

Saying every institution must become a centre of excellence in providing cutting edge knowledge, Shri Naidu said that they should become the focal points in the quest for developing India into an innovation and manufacturing hub. Cautioning the students against lifestyle disorders, he urged them to practice Yoga and meditation for ensuring unity of mind and body.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" I am delighted to interact with students of Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT) here in Nuzvid today.

I am happy to note that the institution is imparting high quality technical education to meritorious rural youth who have been deprived of opportunities both in terms of accessibility and means.

I am also glad to learn that the institution, which offers Bachelor of Technology Degree in six engineering areas is focusing on holistic and all-round development of the students and preparing them to face multitude of challenges in the increasingly competitive world.

The University’s attempt to impart broad-based education, including soft skills, through integrated courses is laudable. I am happy to note that the University is focusing on imparting qualitative learning and enabling the students to imbibe the core values of integrity, respect for others and caring for environment. 

I am pleased to note that the program at RGUKT is built on a new model of liberal professional education with the focus on creating future leaders. I am told that the program is designed to ensure that the students are well equipped with life skills to solve problems rather than become specialized engineers with knowledge of theory. I am also glad to note that the program adopts the learning-by-doing paradigm of education through personalized mentors and intelligent tutoring systems.

My dear students,

Education is the main instrument for socio-economic transformation of the nation and lays the foundation for building a knowledge society. “Education is an investment, an educated individual will indeed serve the society”, said Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya.

It is important in today’s world for the education system to produce holistic individuals, who are committed to strong ethical and moral values. “Education which does not mould character is absolutely worthless”, remarked the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.

Education means the process by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, and intellect is sharpened, as a result of which one can stand on one’s own feet. True education equips the youth to contribute to the material progress of the country as well as to maintain India’s cultural and spiritual heritage.

It is a matter of concern that our education system is merely producing students with degree certificates rather than individuals with critical analytical skills and innovative thinking. And most of the time, the students passing out of colleges do not possess employable skills. This situation has to change and there is a need for a complete overhaul of the education system to make it relevant to the present times.

• ఏదైనా ఒక పని ప్రారంభించే ముందు అనుకున్న దానికన్నా మెరుగ్గా చేయడం ఎలా అని ఆలోచించాలి. దీన్ని జపాన్ వాళ్ళు “కైజిన్ టెక్నిక్” అని పిలుస్తారు. తమ అభివృద్ధిలో దీని పాత్ర కీలకమైనదని వారు అభిప్రాయపడతారు.

Dear Students,

Institutions of higher learning such as RGKUT must prepare a large group of skilled and capable workforce who can drive the economy of the nation and help the nation to deal effectively with various challenges such as agrarian distress, rapid urbanization, growing energy demand, climate change, global warming, urban-rural divide and  economic disparities.

Today’s world is dependent on the competitive use of knowledge and innovation and as students of technology, you must strive to come up with practical, low cost solutions to the problems faced by the society. Our technocrats need to find indigenous solutions rather than look up to alien concepts and practices.  As you all are aware, the sole purpose of Science and Technology is to make the lives of people better. 

Despite the advancement in technology and economic progress, a considerable section of our citizenry is still lacking access to essential resources. This must change and youngsters like you should be in the forefront of bringing about a socio-economic transformation in the lives of the people. You must rise to the occasion and provide solutions to most pressing problems such as ensuring  potable drinking water to every household, eliminating malnutrition and making healthcare affordable and accessible.

Dear friends,

Indian economy is on the rise. We are the fastest growing economy today and set to become the third largest economy in the world in the next 10-15 years. Fortunately, India is a young nation with about 65 per cent of the population below the age of 35 years. We must capitalize on the huge demographic advantage by creating opportunities for excellence, innovations and inventions to thrive. 

To achieve this, every institution must become a centre of excellence in providing cutting edge knowledge. They should become the focal points in the quest for developing India into an innovation and manufacturing hub.

Premier institutions such as NITI Ayog have been engaged in nurturing and supporting innovation under Atal Tinkering Labs. Key social sectors of agritech, healthcare, clean energy, smart mobility, waste management and water resources are some of the areas undertaken by the organization to accelerate the entrepreneurial journey of the young innovators for creating a New India.

Reaching towards such new and Innovative India requires the participation of everybody including the private sector.

Diversifying research, establishing close linkage with industry and making the teaching practices relevant to the needs of the economy at national and global levels assume utmost importance in our endeavour to build nation that is led by innovation.

Dear students and faculty members, you must track the advancements in technologies and keep abreast of them. New domains such as the Big-Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Geo spatial mappings can provide solutions to various problems from agriculture to optimum utilization of renewable energy sources. 

In our quest to achieve sustainable, viable and a healthy nation, we must accelerate our efforts to find solutions that are not only affordable and accessible but should be scalable to help the sizable population.

Institutions of higher education must encourage the culture of excellence and expand their infrastructure to cater to more students seeking skills and knowledge. 

Institutions must train students with qualities of creative-thinking and problem-solving. They have to be supported in their pursuit to experience joy in discovering the unknown territories. 

Before concluding, I would like to caution you against the ill effects of modern, sedentary life styles. Lifestyle disorders of today’s youth are a matter of great concern. We are seeing that lack of exercise, unhealthy dietary habits, increased stress, consumption of alcohol and smoking are among the main causes for growing incidence of non-communicable diseases in the country. It is a matter of concern that many youngsters are getting affected by lifestyle diseases.

I urge all of you to practice Yoga and meditation to ensure that your body and mind remain fit and agile at all times.

• జీవితంలో విజయం సాధించడం ఎంత ముఖ్యమో, దాన్ని ఓ బాధ్యతగా భావించి అలుపెరుగని పరిశ్రమ చేయడం కూడా అంతే అవసరం. ఎందుకంటే విజయం అంటే జీవితంలో ఒక సందర్భం కాదు. మన నిరంతర శ్రమకు లభిస్తూ ఉండే ప్రతిఫలం.

• ఈ సందర్భంగా అబ్దుల్ కలాం చెప్పిన మాటలను మనందరం గుర్తు పెట్టుకోవాలి. “నీ మొదటి విజయం సాధించాక అలక్ష్యం ప్రదర్శించవద్దు. రెండవ ప్రయత్నంలో ఓడిపోతే, నీ గెలుపు గాలివాటం అని చెప్పడానికి చాలా మంది ఎదురు చూస్తుంటారని గుర్తుంచుకో”అనే మాటలను యువకులంతా తమ మనసుల్లో నాటుకోవాలి.

• ముఖ్యంగా ప్రపంచం మధ్య దూరాలను చెరిపేస్తున్న సాంకేతిక పరిజ్ఞానం అనేక సవాళ్ళను మన ముందు ఉంచింది. వీటిని అధిగమించి విద్యార్థులంతా సాంకేతికతను సరైన మార్గంలో వినియోగించుకోవాలంటే, వారి మనసుల్లో విలువలు, సేవ అనే బీజాలు మొలకెత్తడం ఎంతో అవసరం.

I compliment Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies for imparting quality education to rural youth across Andhra Pradesh.

My compliments to the university’s faculty and best wishes to students for their future endeavors!

Jai Hind!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for tapping the creative potential of the country’s youth to make India a leading knowledge and innovation hub.

Addressing the students at the first Graduation Ceremony of PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research at Coimbatore today, the Vice President said that in this age of Intellectual Property Rights, the innovation and entrepreneurship of young professionals will play a major role in propelling India’s economy to newer heights and in creating an inclusive society.

“Please remember that knowledge is going to be the driver of Indian Economy and will play a vital role in improving the living conditions of the people. Therefore, India must rise to the occasion and reorient its higher education system to be globally competitive”, Shri Naidu added.

Stressing the need to harvest India’s demographic dividend, the Vice President said that the time has come to reposition India as one of the leading economic powers in the world. “We need to vastly expand our manufacturing industry, apart from turning our higher education institutions into world class centres of learning”, he added.

Pointing to the need for providing our youth with the wherewithal to make them job creators instead of allowing them to end up as job seekers, Shri Naidu called for focusing on skill training, skill upgradation and promoting innovative entrepreneurship to meet the demands of various sectors, including agriculture.

Urging the youngsters to always uphold ethical values, the Vice President asked them to be responsible towards expectations and aspirations of the larger society.

Referring to former Prime Minister, Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri ji’s clarion call of “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” which was expanded to include “Jai Vigyan” by our former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee, Shri Naidu said that in the current context, the slogan should read “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan”, thus highlighting the crucial need for connectivity. Connectivity is key for development, he added.

Speaking about the power held by technology to transform lives, Shri Naidu said that technology should facilitate the access to basic facilities of life such as education and health. He added that IT brought the power of technology to our palm top. ‘Let this power be delivered to vulnerable sections and to improve the living conditions of the common man’, he said.

Underlining the importance of learning by doing, by designing, experimenting and finding solutions to contemporary problems, the Vice President urged students to focus on multidisciplinary applications of knowledge and new technologies such as Robotics, Big-Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to interact with you all and share some of my thoughts on this momentous occasion of the First Graduation ceremony of PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research. 

Ever since I have assumed this august office of the Vice President of the country, I have used every opportunity to interact with the talented young citizens of our country. And every such occasion fills me with great sense of optimism and hope for a bright future of the country. 

My visits to the educational institutions have been like a pilgrimage. 

A visit to an educational institution is a pilgrimage for a better and brighter future of our society. And today my visit to this prestigious institution is one such occasion. 

The students of this batch have set an example for the future batches.

I am told that more than 85% students of the first batch have secured placement in the field of their core competence. 

I congratulate you all for a brighter and promising career. 

In Indian tradition it is said that knowledge can neither be taxed, nor can it be stolen, neither can it be divided among siblings, it only increases by spending and sharing, therefore wealth of the knowledge is the best among all types of wealth.

న చోర హార్యం | న రాజ హార్యం |

న భ్రాత్ర భాజ్యం | న చ భారకారీ |

వ్యయే కృతే | వర్ధతే ఏవ నిత్యం | 

విద్యా ధనం | సర్వధన ప్రధానం |

Living by this sublime ideal, the PSG & Sons’ Charities Trust has spread knowledge among more than 3 lakh students mostly from weaker section through their 30 educational institutions ever since this charitable organization was established in 1924. I compliment the management of the charity, the faculty and the students for their great contributions to the national upliftment. 

Friends, 

We have all grown up with the Shastri ji’s clarion call of “ Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”. After the successful Operation Shakti in 1998, our former Prime Minister Atal ji added “ Jai Vigyan” to this slogan, underlining the importance of science and technology in modern society. Today, we need to repose trust in the innovative spirit of our future entrepreneurs and professionals. The slogan now should be “ Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan” . 

We need to strengthen the value chain between lab and land, from the conception of an innovative idea to its development into a commercial product. In this age of Intellectual Property rights, innovation and entrepreneurship of young professionals will play a major role in propelling our economy to newer heights and in creating an inclusive society. 

Please remember that knowledge is going to be the driver of Indian Economy and will play a vital role in improving the living conditions of the people. Therefore, India must rise to the occasion and reorient its higher education system to be globally competitive.

Education is not only for employment. It should empower the individual with knowledge and wisdom to sift the wheat from the chaff. Access to education for all and at all levels is equally essential to ensure inclusive growth and prevent any kind of discrimination. 

At present India enjoys immense demographic dividend with 65% of our population being under 35 years. We have a work force of around 48 crores with a crore joining every year. However, we have a very narrow window of 20 years till 2040 to harvest this demographic dividend. 

As we have the advantage of one of the largest educated youth force, the need of the hour is tap their creative potential to the optimum to make India a leading knowledge and innovation hub. Please remember that India was once called as ‘Vishwaguru’ and the country used to contribute 27 per cent of the global GDP. 

The time has come to reposition India as one of the leading economic powers in the world. We need to vastly expand our manufacturing industry, apart from turning our higher education institutions into world class centres of learning.

At the same time, we need to focus on skill training, skill upgradation and promote innovative entrepreneurship to meet the demands of various sectors, including agriculture. We have to provide our youth with wherewithal to make them job creators instead of allowing them to end up as job seekers. 

I am happy that our young entrepreneurs are gradually becoming job providers. Today more than 1.5 lakh jobs have been generated by Start Ups. India is increasingly emerging as innovation society and I am glad that as many as 21 States including Tamil Nadu, have formulated their Start Up policies to encourage and incentivize Start Up entrepreneurs. Today with 39,000 Start Ups, we are the second largest global hub of Start ups. It is also heartening to note that 44% of these Start Ups are located in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. That indicates the culture of innovative entrepreneurship is confined to big cities and is also thriving in smaller towns. 

The global investors have confidence in our Start Ups. Investment in these Startup enterprises through Alternative Investment Funds has reached Rs. 80,000 crores. This shows resilience and business viability of our entrepreneurs. 

I am happy that PSG Institute of Technology has realized the importance of innovation and you are inculcating and promoting the spirit of innovation and applied research through your Centres of Excellence and Innovation Centers. 

I am happy to note that in association with prominent industry players and others, you have set up Centers of Excellence and Innovation Centres for virtual instrumentation, conducting training programs, workshops and internships for students in Mobile application and Internet of Things (IoT), developing requisite skills for a digital economy and eYantra Robotic lab with the help of IIT, Bombay. 

I am told that you have also set up Product Application Center (PAC) to ensure that students connect engineering concepts with real world engineering applications. 

These Centers of Excellence are excellent examples of Industry- academy partnership and will give requisite exposure to students of applied research, explore new ideas and test their technical applicability and business viability. The students shall have exposure to a wider spectrum of developments taking place in the field of engineering and technology. 

I am happy to learn that PSG Design Data Book is popular among all engineering colleges in India and abroad. 

I am confident that the young students, startup innovators and young entrepreneurs, who are passing out today will make this institution proud.

While doing so, please remember the vision Statement of your esteemed institution, that is “To achieve excellence in education and research, and nurture engineers with ethics…”. Always remember the ethical values imparted by your institution and teachers. Be responsible towards expectations and aspirations of the larger society. 

You have a promise to keep with larger society. You have a commitment towards community. Thirukkural  says 

యాదానుం   నాడామల్   |  ఊరామాల్    ఎండ్రు ఒరువన్ | సాంతొణయుం కల్లాద వార్

“Learn flawlessly all that is to be learnt and then live true to it.”. Be true to your knowledge, values and wisdom. I am extremely pleased to know that PSG through its Corporate Social Responsibility has been sharing wisdom of Indian Philosophy through monthly discourses. 

These lessons are important to keep you grounded in your social ethos. 

The charitable and philanthropic work undertaken by PSG and Sons Trust is truly commendable and worthy of emulation by others. PSG founder, PS Govendaraj had shown his concern for the underprivileged through his charitable deeds and not by mere words. While he has three sons, he divided his properties into four parts so that the activities of the Trust could be run by the apportioned portion. The country needs more and more such organizations to cater to the requirements of the poor and marginalized sections.

Young Friends, 

The resilience of a society is reflected in its relentless pursuit of an improved quality of life for its citizens. A significant portion of our citizens still do not have easy access to essential social resources. We need to enhance access to services like education, quality health care, timely, authentic and relevant information, access to government services and e-governance initiatives. 

Technology should facilitate the access to these facilities. IT brings power to your palm top. Let this power be delivered to vulnerable sections. Ensure that the new technologies are used to improve the living conditions of the common man, particularly the marginalized sections like women, farmers, unorganized laborers and each citizen of our country. 

Dear students, 

The global landscape is changing fast. We are now living in exciting times. India has emerged as the fastest growing major economy in the world and is projected to become the third largest in the coming years. As a result, the opportunities for the youth will be abundant in various fields. However, the educational institutions must change according to changing times and impart relevant skill sets to young students. Accordingly, the curricular and pedagogical methods have to be recast. 

Students need to learn by doing, by designing and experimenting and finding solutions to contemporary problems. Students need to focus on multidisciplinary applications of knowledge. New technologies such as Robotics, Big-Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence are going to play a major role in shaping our lives. We need products and technologies that are indigenous, low cost, rapidly deployable at a mass scale, robust and resilient to disruptions. 

I would also like to emphasise the importance of organising students’ field visits to rural areas by higher educational institutions. Students should be made to spend a few days with families in rural areas so that they experience firsthand the problems and challenges faced by people in villages.  It will enable them to think and come up with new ideas to overcome the challenges faced by rural people.

We must never be complacent and be satisfied with what we have achieved. Innovation requires constant churning of ideas and creative, thinking to develop unique products. 

I am sure you will continue your quest for excellence in the years to come. Retain your innovative instinct to disrupt the status quo. 

As Thirukkural  states- 

తొట్టనైత్తు ఊరుం | మణర్కేణి మాంతరుక్కు |

కట్ర నైత్తు ఊరుం అరివు |

“The deeper you dig a sandy bed, the more water flows; even so, the deeper you learn, the greater is your wisdom”. 

I am optimistic that the students, scholars and faculty members of this relatively young institution will shape this institution as a benchmark in the next wave of technological change. 

Dear Students, 

I compliment you on your dreams and hope you will put in adequate efforts to achieve them. I wish the PSG Institute of Technology every success in realizing your vision for India’s glorious future. 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the education system should be reoriented by ensuring greater linkage between academia-industry to make students employable.

He was addressing the gathering at the Vel Tech University in Chennai today. The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President wanted the government, academia and the industry to come together to look into reorienting the education system so that students coming out from the portals of higher education institutions are employable or become self-employed.

Earlier Shri Naidu visited the Nidhi-CoE Lab at the university. He said that business incubation has been globally recognized as an important tool for economic development and job creation. He further said that the innovation, incubation and start-ups are the buzz words in today’s world and countries and societies which are knowledge-centric and technology-driven will play an increasing role in the global economy. For us in India, this is the time to seize the opportunity and promote the culture of innovation and technology-based entrepreneurship, he added.

He lauded the institute for its focus on research-intensive teaching and learning practices. Innovation and Entrepreneurship are going to be the twin engines that will propel India to a new era of economic prosperity and social inclusion, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am extremely happy to join you this morning and interact with students, faculty members and entrepreneurs of the innovation-based start-ups promoted by the prestigious Nidhi –CoE lab in your institution. 

I am informed this is the only Centre of Excellence in the private sector among the six such CoEs approved in the first phase.

I would like to appreciate Prof. Col. Vel R Rangarajan and Dr. Sagunthala Rangarajan, the Founders of Vel Tech for providing quality education through a multitude of academic programmes. 

I am told that students are drawn from all over India and abroad, representing different sections. It makes the institute one of India’s most culturally diverse learning centres.

Business incubation has been globally recognized as an important tool for economic development and job creation. 

Keeping this in view, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Division of Department of Science and Technology (DST) has been supporting technology-based startups through its flagship programme of “Technology Business Incubator”.

Dear Students/ Researchers 

Innovation, incubation and start-ups are the buzz words in today’s world and countries and societies which are knowledge-centric and technology-driven will play an increasing role in the global economy. For us in India, this is the time to seize the opportunity and promote the culture of innovation and technology-based entrepreneurship.

We have to stay ahead of the curve if we have to play a meaningful and important role in the 4th Industrial Revolution. Unlike many other countries, India is placed in an advantageous position. India has a tremendous demographic dividend that is waiting to be realized. In an ageing world, India has one of the youngest populations. By 2020, the median age in India will be just 28, compared to 37 in China and the US, 45 in Western Europe, and 49 in Japan.

With about 65 per cent of the population below the age of 35 years, we need to convert this huge human capital into a force multiplier for the Indian economy by technologically empowering the youth. Entrepreneurship helps the economy of a country to grow and create jobs. 

Education lays the foundation for the progress of a nation. Today India has one of the largest number of higher education institutions and holds an important place in the global education arena.

Today, the country has an opportunity to focus on innovation in the field of education to meet the global competitions. But this requires tremendous transformation from reorienting the curriculum framework to refining the infrastructure with the sole objective of imparting world class quality education.

With the country producing lakhs of engineering graduates each year, the need of the hour is to provide the right ecosystem for new ideas, breakthroughs and innovations to make India the leader in start-ups and technology-driven high growth ventures. Therefore, it cannot be business as usual. We have to press the accelerator to be in the forefront of a new technology-driven world that will set the pace for the future. 

Of course, technology-based new enterprises face high risk and they require an enabling environment like NIDHI-Centre of Excellence (NIDHI-CoE) to enhance the prospects of their success.

I am told that the primary objectives of NIDHI-CoE are aimed at promoting new technology/knowledge/innovation based impact making startups; build a vibrant startup ecosystem by establishing a network between academia, financial institutions, industries and other institutions and to create jobs, wealth and business in alignment with national priorities.

As you all are aware, entrepreneurship helps the economy of a country to grow and create new jobs. India is the fastest growing economy in the world today and is projected to become the third largest in the next 10-15 years. I am sure that the start-ups in the services sector would play a prominent role in propelling the economy in the years ahead.

Dear Students/Researchers, the Global Innovation Index has ranked India in the 57th position last year, while many smaller nations are ahead of India. We need to focus on reorienting our higher education system, particularly of the engineering and scientific streams, to ensure that the students who pass out from these institutions come up with creative and innovative solutions to the problems faced by the country and the world at large. 

Teaching-learning methods should be transformed as learning by facilitation where students learn actively with peers. We have to keep innovating our curricula, infrastructure, pedagogy, teaching and examination methodology and our technology tools.

The challenges faced by the modern world are multi-dimensional. There is increasing urbanization and industrialization on the one hand and agrarian distress on the other. Climate change, growing levels of pollution, increasing demand for energy, eradicating poverty and illiteracy are all major challenges that require innovative and out-of-box ideas. An important aspect that needs the attention of both the government and the private sector is the need to step up funds for R & D. Similarly, the linkages between the academia and the industry have to grow organically. 

I am quite happy to know that Vel Tech is playing an important role in developing and supporting entrepreneurs through its Vel Tech–Technology Business Incubator. It is also quite heartening to note that Vel Tech TBI motivated 103 young innovators to start their own companies by using the facilities established at Vel Tech TBI.

I am glad to know that among QS top ranked universities, Veltech is the First and only Member of CDIO (Conceiving-Designing-Implementing-Operating) initiative from India. I am also told this institution has taken numerous steps to inculcate research culture among the students by giving an opportunity to faculty and students to involve in scientific, interdisciplinary, cross-professional research which is supported by CDIO approach.

It is heartening to note that the institute focuses upon research-intensive teaching and learning practices to create critical thinkers. Innovation and Entrepreneurship are going to be the twin engines that propel India to a new era of economic prosperity and social inclusion.

My greetings to each one of you on your achievements and best wishes for your continued success!

JAI HIND!""

Both the leaders exchanged views on parliamentary functioning, bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest. They committed to further strengthen India-Argentina multi-faceted cooperation now elevated to a strategic partnership. They recalled the road-map laid by the two leaders during the President of Argentina, Mr. Mauricio Macri visit to India. They also stressed the need for both sides to work together in the new areas identified including defence, nuclear energy, space, mining including Lithium, Antarctica, agriculture, IT, health, renewable and non-renewable energy, tourism, films etc.

Shri Naidu acknowledged the efforts made by the Vice President of Argentina for empowerment of people with disabilities, both within Argentina and globally. He also appreciated the peaceful and invigorating experience she had at the Brahma Kumar is event in which she participated recently.

The Vice President of Argentina invited the Vice President of India to visit Argentina and participate in the Global Disability Conference which is going to be held in Argentina in June 2019.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has advised the IRS Officer Trainees to make ethics and excellence as their guiding principles. He was addressing the 173 Officer Trainees of the 72ndBatch of Indian Revenue Service, here today.

The Vice President said that reforms in governance, path-breaking legislative and administrative measures like GST are changing the way we govern ourselves. Quoting Prime Minister’s advice to all administrators - “Reform, Perform and Transform”, he said that you have the aptitude and a unique opportunity to reform and transform our country with your performance.

Saying a lot of transformation is taking place in the Tax administration in the country to promote a culture of tax compliance, Shri Naidu said that the most remarkable outcome of demonetization was the sustained growth of digital transactions leaving behind digital trail for the Revenue department to follow. As tax-authorities, you should encourage digital transactions and incentivize business to encourage their customers to adopt digital transactions, he added.

The Vice President quoted Kautilya who said that the government should collect the tax like honeybee which collects only appropriate amount of honey so that both could survive. Our effort too is to make our tax regime easy, transparent and predictable and we expect you to facilitate this process of further easing the tax regime without relaxing the compliance, he added.

Saying that IRS Officer Trainees are entering into this service at a crucial juncture in country’s economy, Shri Naidu advised them to make India a business friendly, entrepreneur-friendly tax regime and a people-centric tax administration. He further said that India is the fastest growing economy in the world with restrained inflation and the steady economic growth, much better than most economies, makes India the best place to work.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I extend a very warm welcome to you all and wish you every success in your professional career.

You all have successfully qualified for this service after a fairly rigorous selection process. I congratulate you all for joining this coveted career.

As you enter into a promising and demanding career, I believe that you are entering the service at a critical moment in India’s growth story.

The steady economic growth, much better than most economies, makes India the best place to work. 

Reforms in governance, path-breaking legislative and administrative measures like GST are changing the way we govern ourselves. Our Prime Minister has given a very effective advice to all administrators when he said: - “Reform, Perform and Transform”. You have the aptitude and a unique opportunity to reform and transform our country with your performance.

Kautilya’s dictum “Treasury is the basis of Power”- is the motto of the Income Tax Department. You have the privilege of making our country’s economy more robust by efficient resource mobilization.

Kautilya also said “All the programmes depend first and foremost on the Treasury”. The edifice of welfare governance is built on the resources available with the State.  As the ancient Indians described the role of the State, “the King collected tax from the public for public welfare and public good, just as the Sun draws moisture from the earth to give it back a thousand-fold.”

Over the last four years, Union Government’s Budget expenditure has increased from around Rs 16 lakh crores (RE 2013-14) to around Rs 28 lakh crores (BE 2019-20).

Government’s development efforts have been ably supported by the buoyant revenue collection due to efforts of Revenue Department. Over the last four years, Central Government’s net Tax revenue has increased from Rs 8.2 lakh crores (2013-14) to estimated Rs 17 lakh crores (BE 2019-20).An estimated increase of about Rs.9 lakh crores in five years is a telling example of efficiency and competence of our Revenue Officials.

Despite our enhanced budget expenditure on welfare schemes because of buoyancy in revenue collections, we have followed the path of fiscal discipline of FRBM Act and have restrained our fiscal deficit to around 3.4% of the GDP. 

There has been a 80% increase in the tax base over last four years.

A lot of transformation is taking place in the Tax administration in the country to promote a culture of tax compliance.

The Demonetization brought undisclosed income of about Rs 1,30,000 crore under the tax and led to seizure and attachment of assets worth approximately Rs 50,000 crore. Benami assets worth Rs 6,900 crore and foreign assets worth Rs 1,600 crore have been attached. As many as 3,38,000 shell companies have been detected and de-registered.

The most remarkable outcome of demonetization was the sustained growth of digital transactions leaving behind digital trail for the Revenue department to follow. As tax-authorities, I will expect you to encourage digital transactions and incentivize business to encourage their customers to adopt digital transactions.

The Government has been promoting the use of digital technology in Tax administration. In this year’s interim budget, the Government has proposed a technology intensive project to transform the Income-tax Department into a more assessee friendly one. It is proposed that all returns will be processed in twenty-four hours and refunds issued simultaneously.  It is therefore necessary that the Revenue Officers should have intense training in technology and regularly upgrade their technology skills.

Kautilya said that the government should collect the tax like honeybee which collects only appropriate amount of honey so that both could survive.

Our effort too is to make our tax regime easy, transparent and predictable.  We expect you to facilitate this process of further easing the tax regime without relaxing the compliance.  

That was why the Government took up the resolve to implement GST, that was languishing for 17 years. It was the single biggest tax reform in the world which turned India into a single market without tax barriers. It is a shining example of cooperative federalism. The reporting requirements have been gradually eased. Despite continuous rate reductions and reporting relaxations, GST collection trends are encouraging. The average monthly tax collection during 2018-19 has been Rs 97,100 crore per month as compared to Rs 89,700 crore per month in the first year. It proves that an easy, predictable tax regime with low tax rates, ensures better tax compliance and increased revenue realization.

My dear Young Officers,

You are entering into this service at a crucial juncture in country’s economy.  And this fact has been acknowledged by every prominent international agency like IMF, World Bank and even Moody’s. We are the fastest growing economy in the world with restrained inflation.

Young Officers,

While the forces of liberalization and globalisation have brought new buoyancy in the country’s economy, it has also opened an international dimension of tax evasion. You will have to keep yourself abreast with the global financial regime and global movement of capital. Associated with this is the issue of funding of global terror networks through illegitimate Hawala networks. You will be required to closely coordinate with enforcement agencies and Bankers The world is gradually building a global regime to track and report tax evasions, financial frauds fugitives. The Government is actively supporting the need for such a global regime.

We have been steadfast in our fight against unaccounted money and organized financial corruption. To track down tax offenders, we have renegotiated the Double Taxation Treaties with countries like Switzerland, OECD countries, Mauritius and have signed Automatic Information Exchange Agreements with Tax Havens. The Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Amendment Act has been passed. Similarly, Fugitive Economic Offenders Act has been passed to take over the properties of economic fugitives, in India and abroad. I expect that you must be well-versed in international dimensions of tax evasion.

As I told you, you are entering into this service at a crucial juncture in country’s economy, your role becomes crucial in making India a business friendly, and entrepreneur-friendly tax regime and a people-centric tax administration.

I wish you a very successful and gratifying professional career with ethics and excellence as your guiding principles.

Jai Hind.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has made a joint Press Statement along with the President of Costa Rica, Mr. Carlos Alvarado Quesada, in San Jose, Costa Rica on March 08, 2019.

Following is the text of Vice President's statement:

""Your Excellency President Carlos Alvarado Quesada

& Distinguished Representatives of the Costa Rican Media

My delegation and I are indeed delighted to visit Costa Rica, which is a beautiful country and a leading economy in Central America.

Costa Rica has highest per sq km biodiversity in the world. Its rich flora and fauna are well known. It has 25% of protected green cover and holds highest ranking in the Happy Planet Index for being the greenest with highest environment-friendly disposition and attitude.

Yesterday I had addressed a business forum meeting.

Earlier today, I was honoured to be given the opportunity to speak at University of Peace.

Coming from the land of Mahatma Gandhi and in the year when we celebrate 150th anniversary of Bapu's birthday, the gesture was particularly moving for me.

India is a peace loving country but has been a target of terrorism from across our border for the last few decades.

We discussed in detail the menace of terrorism and the need to fight in one voice. The dastardly terrorist attack on the Indian security forces on February 14, 2019 in Pulwama by a terrorist organization proscribed by the UN has once again demonstrated the need for decisive action by international community against individuals and terrorist groups engaged in terrorist activities.

President Quesada and I have had fruitful and cordial exchanges covering a range of areas of mutual interest spanning bilateral, regional and multilateral fields.

There are many new areas of collaboration that hold potential to propel our bilateral relations to new heights.

Costa Rican strengths that we desire to take advantage of include eco tourism, clean transport including support to bicycling, higher investment in education, ambition to have a zero carbon emission economy by 2021.

Indian strengths that Costa Rica can benefit from include space and biotechnology, renewable including solar, pharmaceuticals, ICT particularly eGovernance, hydroelectric generators and power plant equipments, farm machinery and skill upgradation, railway construction and rolling stock.

I invited Costa Rican companies to invest in India. I pointed out that as many Costa Rican CEOs and influential businessmen have close connections with angel investors and businessmen in the developed countries, they may look at expanding to India and benefiting from high return on investment offered by the attractive Indian economy.

We can collaborate effectively and to mutual benefit through academic exchange, university to university collaboration including high speed virtual connectivity.

Based on our fruitful exchanges, we are confident that our mutual efforts will open up new and innovative vistas for deepening ongoing engagement between both countries.

With air connectivity using code sharing between our airlines and visitor friendly visas, we would be able to promote closer people to people linkages which are the prerequisite for widening and deepening of bilateral relations.

We applaud proclamation of a Presidential decree in October 2018 whereby all activities and initiatives related to promotion of Yoga and Meditation have been declared to be in public interest thereby facilitating the promotion of Yoga within Costa Rica.

The two rounds of our Foreign Office Consultations till date have proved very useful to comprehensively discuss the various issues that our relationship encompasses. We have asked our teams to hold the next round of the Consultations at an early date.

I express my sincere thanks to President Quesada and the people of Costa Rica for the warm hospitality and excellent arrangements made for our visit.""

                The Vice President of India and Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has been conferred an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Peace founded by the United Nations Organisations (UNO)  for his contribution “to the Rule of Law, democracy and sustainable development in India”. Shri Naidu yesterday received the degree of ‘Doctor of Philosophy’ (Doctor Honoris Causa)  from the Dean of the University of Peace in the Costa Rican capital of San Jose.

The University of Peace was founded further to a resolution of United Nations’ General Assembly in December, 1980  incorporating an International Agreement for the establishment of the University of Peace with the mandate of “Engaging in dissemination of knowledge fundamental to the full development of the human person and societies through interdisciplinary study of all matters relating to peace”. India is a signatory to this resolution and Shri Venkaiah Naidu is the first Indian to receive an Honorary Doctorate from this University. 

As Minister of Urban Development for over three years from 2014, Shri Vankaiah Naidu piloted environment friendly and sustainable urban  planning and development strategies  in the context of rapid urbanisation in the country. New urban initiatives launched viz. Smart City Mission, AMRUT, Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), Housing For All, Transit Oriented Development (TOD), etc. focus on reducing carbon emissions, enhanced use of renewable source of energy, green construction practices, promotion of open and green spaces, walking and cycling, reduced travel from home to workplaces, energy conservation, waste reduction and recycling, citizen participation in planning and execution, ICT based citizen service delivery etc. He was also Chairman for an year of the UN – HABITAT  that seeks to promote affordable housing under the Sustainable Development Goals. Since becoming Vice President in 2017, Shri Naidu, during his extensive travels within the country has been advocating the cause of rule of law, overcoming narrow identities, transparent governance and inclusive development.  

In his acceptance speech, Shri Naidu said “This (Honorary Doctorate) is more an honour for my country than to me as  an individual. It is an honour bestowed on a country, a civilization and a culture that has been an ardent and consistent champion of peace since time immemorial. I am privileged to receive this honour when the world is commemorating the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gandhi Ji, the extraordinary apostil of peace”.

Shri Naidu called for defeating the destructive forces of hatred, the fanatical cries of religious bigotry and the megalomaniac designs of despotic rulers to ensure peace for promoting the welfare of humankind. Urging the people to see others as their own kin, Dr. Naidu said “The ability to appreciate and celebrate the fascinating diversity in thoughts , languages, cultures and religious beliefs is the foundation for our ability to live together. Peace begins with our search for common bonds that unite us rather than when we look for and accentuate the differences”. 

Stressing on the need to appreciate ‘divinity’  in every human being, Shri Naidu called for building a larger collective effort to present a world view drawn from all the major faiths to encourage a greater understanding of the essential tenets that promote peace through promotion of inter-faith understanding. He asserted that Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Jainism shun violence and stress on the overarching themes of universal brotherhood and peaceful co-existence. 

The Vice President noted that terrorism has emerged as the biggest threat to the world peace even as the world is getting more globalised and closely knit through trade, commerce and information technology and India is bearing the impact of this most serious challenge. Stating that radicalisation on the basis of religion is gaining ground, Shri Naidu called for combating terrorism with the collective might by breaking its nexus  with illicit financial and arms flows.  India’s endeavour towards peaceful development has only too often being derailed by cross border terrorism, he said. 

Referring to inequalities and exclusion as the major causes of conflict derailing peace, Shri Naidu gave on account of the initiatives taken by the Government to promote inclusive and sustainable development. He said good governance with citizen involvement, enforcing the rule of law and  speedy  judicial redressal  can enhance public satisfaction besides reducing conflicts. 

Stating that peace is synonymous with development, Shri Naidu said that national fervour and international cooperation shall co-exist and force shall be used only to defend and not to attack. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""Distinguished Dean of the University Juan Carlos Sainz-Borgo, Distinguished members of the academic community, Esteemed members of the diplomatic corps, Esteemed officials of the government of Costa Rica, My dear students, Distinguished Sisters and Brothers.

Pura Vida and Namaskar to all of you!

I am delighted to be here with all of you today at the University for Peace (UPeace). It is, indeed a humbling experience for me to be be honoured with the degree of Doctor of Letters (Honoris Causa). This is an honor for my country rather than to me as an individual. It is an honour you are bestowing to a country, a civilization and a culture that has been an ardent and consistent champion of peace since time immemorial. It is a country that demonstrated to the world the power of ‘non-violence’. I am proud to belong to a country that produced Gandhiji, a rare colossus whose ideas on peace and non-violence have been a source of inspiration for over a century to different leaders in different parts of the world. I am privileged to receive this honour when the world is commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, the extraordinary apostle of peace, who has been enshrined in yourbeautiful campus within The Peace Garden.

I am indeed grateful to the University for Peace for thinking of me and my country for this unique honour. To me, it is a recognition of the continuing relevance of Indian thought and vision in addressing contemporary challenges to world peace. 

Sisters and brothers,

The history of human kind is a fascinating saga of endless quest for peace. This quest progresses against the backdrop of a ceaseless conflict between the forces of war and forces of peace, between destructive forces of hatred and healing forces of love and development, between fanatical war cries of religious bigotry and the soothing forces of tolerance and inclusion, between the megalomaniac designs of despotic rulers and the caring, empathetic forces promoting the welfare and well being of all. 

The world today needs a vision that will rally most countries behind the forces of peace. The isolationist, fragmented, blinkered and divisive world view needs a radical transformation if peace has to have a chance. Against this backdrop, your honour which I am receiving today is an honour to a timeless vision that is relevant to the contemporary world more than ever before. It is an occasion to recollect what India, the founding member of this University, has to offer to further the objectives of this University and to build a culture of peace around the world. 

The University's founding motto of ""SI VIS PACEM – PARA PACEM"" which translates as “If you desire peace, prepare for peace”. The question is “How do you prepare for peace”?

“Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that defences of peace must be constructed”, says the preamble to the Constitution of UNESCO. It is the mindset that needs to change. Education is the most potent instrument for this transformation. Knowledge and attitudes are mainly shaped in our educational institutions but they are influenced significantly by the mass media, the social media, by the political leadership, families and communities. If defences of peace have to be built, all these institutions have a role to play. However, the first step is to define the contours of a world view. It is here that Indian thought can be helpful. 

Indian sages and philosophers had, around the 4th century BC, had given a universal vision of peaceful co-existence. Let me quote one verse that gives you a glimpse of this vision:

“Ayamnijahparovaitigananaalaghuchetasaam,

UdaaracharitaaanaamtuVasudhaivaKutumbakam”

(Only the narrow minded persons consider some individuals as their own and others as alien. For those who have a liberal disposition, the whole world is merely a large family”.)

This is essentially about identity. We all have multiple identities, as a member of certain groups based on gender, language, religion, social group, common interest and nationality. The question is whether we can transcend these groups and identities and see others as our kin, as members of our large, extended family. The ability to appreciate and celebrate the fascinating diversity in thoughts, languages, cultures and religious beliefs is the foundation for the ability to live together. Peace begins with our search for the common bonds that unite us rather than when we look for and accentuate the differences. 

The second useful thought process is the ability to see divinity in every human being. One of the ancient Indian philosophic texts, Ishavasya Upanishad, says, “Every living being in this universe has the same divinity within it.” Once we recognize that each human being is divine and has the same emotions and capabilitiesas any one else, we cannot but be respectful of each other. There can be no oppression, suppression and exploitation. Non-violence is a natural, concomitant corollary to this world view.

In leading India to independence by following the path of non-violence, Mahatma Gandhi had served as the inspiration for non-violent movements across the world. Today, the world acknowledges his contribution to peace by celebrating International Day for Non-Violence on the occasion of his birthday on 2nd October. Indeed, so integral is peace to India’s civilizational ethos, that every prayer in India invokes peace, or shanti.     

The 21stcentury has been described as a paradoxical epoch that is at once full of hope for peaceful co-existence but is also full of possibilities of conflicts. In the last century, the extraordinary vision and a clear recognition of mankind’s shared destiny led to the establishment of the United Nations, and after seven decades it continues to represent mankind’s collective dream of peace.However, that collective dream of the United Nations is today threatened by diverse forces of disruption.

As the world becomes more and more globalized and closely knit due to the forces of trade, commerce and information technology, the threats to global peace have also become more pervasive. Terrorism is the biggest scourge of our lives. It, along with threats like climate change and public health epidemics, do not follow the contours of political borders. In such circumstances, the United Nations, international cooperation and Member States acting in the spirit of cooperation are the only means of effectively facing these challenges.  

UN itself would need to be strengthened. An expansion of the UN Security Council, which should include India - a country with one sixth of humanity, and the fastest growing large economy- will make it more representative and effective.

Even, as we in India celebrate 150th Anniversary of Gandhiji, the Mahatma or Great Soul, we continue to bear the impact of the most serious challenge to world peace. Terrorism has resulted in loss of lives of many innocent people. It has disrupted day-to-day living in so many parts of the world. Radicalization on the basis of religion is gaining ground.Indeed, terrorism is actually a struggle between the values of humanism and acts of inhumanity.  It is a menacing threat to humanity that raises its ugly head and leaves a trail of destruction wherever it strikes. We must combat it with all the collective might. Its unholy nexus with illicit financial and arms flows must be severed.As one of the most diverse nations of the world, the people of India have practiced the concept of peace and harmonious co-existence for thousands of years.  But India has also suffered the pain of cross-border strife. Our endeavour towards peaceful development has only too often been de-railed by cross-border terrorism.

Simultaneously, concerted action has to be taken to correct the distorted versions of religious interpretation.

We must build a larger collective effort to present a world view drawn from all the major faiths to encourage a greater understanding of the essential tenets that promote peace. These messages of peace need to reach wider audiences. The universal message of Hinduism with the overarching themes of universal brotherhood and peaceful coexistence have been cited earlier by me. In addition, greater emphasis should be given to the “paths of peace” of Holy Quran which show that “God abhors any disturbance of peace” and that “God grants to the non-violent what he doesn’t grant to the violent”. Focus should be on  Christian teachings like “Blessed are the peace makers, for those promote peace”, “God wants us to live in harmony with one another” and “God is not a God of disorder but of peace”. Buddhism and Jainism have “non-violence” as the basic article of faith. These values and precepts have to be woven into the educational systems and inter-faith understanding should be further enriched.

Another challenge to world peace is that of climate change. Here again, the Indian world view had adopted an integrated perspective clearly establishing the inter-relatedness of humankind and nature. As the Vedic sages have said, 

“May there be peace everywhere, in the sky, in space, all over our planet, in nature

May there be eternal peace.” 

I am happy to note that there are some beautiful lines in Costa Rica’s national anthem that celebrate nature:

“Under the clear blue of your sky

White and pure rests peace”

It is this reverence for nature that must be brought back into our global culture and consciousness.

No country is spared the effect of extreme climatic events, and no Government can ignore the consequences of its destabilizing effects. A particularly painful feature of climate change is that it tends to impact the vulnerable populations the most.Mitigating the effects of climate change remains one of the most pressing challenges to peace and human security of our times through causing water and food stress on the planet. It is, therefore, pertinent that the UPEACE has its campus in Costa Rica, a country that is at the forefront of leading these initiatives. 

India, despite having a historically low carbon foot-print, has been playing an active role in the global fight against climate change. In our multifaceted approach to address climate change, we have taken several new initiatives. With the motto of One World, One Sun and One Grid, India’s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Bhai Modi has launched in collaboration with the French Government the International Solar Alliance (ISA). ISA which is a partnership of 120 like-minded countries, aims to mobilize investments of $1 trillion for installing 1000 GW solar plants worldwide by 2030. 

Inequalities and exclusion are major causes of conflict. Peace cannot be sustained in an environment where certain groups are marginalized or exploited. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development underscores this aspect and aims to “leave no one behind”. India has embarked on a number of programmes that have the same inclusive approach called “SabkaSaath, Sabka Vikas” (Assistance to all and development of all). All countries in the world should adopt similar inclusive approaches to development which will avoid discontent and conflict. 

Good governance with high level of accountability and transparency can also create a favourable peaceful environment. 

India is undertaking ambitious actions for the social and economic development and poverty eradication. The rapid growth made by India in its development agenda has contributed to moving forward on the sustainable development goals.

I am also glad that I am speaking to you on the occasion of International Women’s Day. I do hope that all countries will give greater attention to women’s education and empowerment in their development architecture. Empowering women to actively participate in national development has been a key cornerstone of our policy.

India has experimented with giving leadership roles to over 3 million women in the local bodies across the country. 

The key ingredients of good governance are meaningful dialogue with the people and their active participation. This is also the essence of democracy where the voice of people finds the best articulation. India has had a long history of grassroot level village organisations called Sabhas,Sanghas and Samitis. These are forums of grassroot level democracy. Strengthening these forums of discussion, debate and incorporation of the voice of people in policy making creates a favourable environment for peace to thrive. Simultaneously, enforcing the rule of law,creating speedy, objective systems of judicial redressal can enhance public satisfaction and reduce conflicts. Credible elections can reinforce the faith of public at large in democratic institutions and convince them that the ballot is more powerful than the bullet.  

Peace is an integral part of the world we all want. As the world community resolved while formulating its goals for 2030, “We are determined to foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies which are free from fear and violence. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development.”            

Peace is not merely absence of conflict but a positive state of well being in which each individual in society can feel free to grow and access opportunities equitably, where justice is dispensed without fear or favour, where the rule of law prevails, where there is no discrimination on any basis, where national fervor and international cooperation co-exist and where force is used only to defend not to attack and the focus of the polity is on improving the quality of people’s lives. 

Peace, therefore, is synonymous with development and civilized existence. It is the basic prerequisite for progress. The world should focus on reducing the income inequalities and should ensure that persistent development challenges like illiteracy, malnutrition, hunger and poverty are adequately addressed. We should aim at creating a world where every person has equal opportunities to succeed, to make progress and lead a happy life.

I am happy to note that since its inception in 1980, this University has produced hundreds of students in the different programmes of study and disciplines.As a strong, global knowledge player with a long history of learning, India is proud of its growing association with UPEACE, especially through this University’s India Initiative.

Let me conclude with the fervent hope that your efforts in the university will trigger a thought process which will result in tangible action to promote peace in the world. It has to be a two-pronged approach. The first component should be effectively combating the forces of hatred, violence, terrorism and organized crime. Simultaneously we should focus on strengthening democratic institutions, promoting the rule of law and resolutely reinforcing just and inclusive governance and implement aninclusive sustainable development agenda. India, as usual, would be happy to be in the vanguard of this movement. 

Thank you!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has held high level talks with the leadership of Paraguay, in Asuncion today, in a bid to extend India’s outreach in the Latin American region and strengthen bilateral ties. 

 

The Vice President who is on a two-day visit to the Latin American Country, is the highest-level representative of the Republic of India to visit Paraguay in the last 58 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries on 13 September 1961. 

 

Shri Naidu is accompanied by a high-level delegation consisting of the Minister of State for Tourism (I/C), Shri Alphons Kannanthanam, the Member of Parliament, Shri Ram Kumar Kashyap and senior officials from the Government of India.

 

The Vice President called on the President of the Republic of Paraguay, Mr. Mario Abdo Benítez, the Vice President, Mr. Hugo Velázquez, and the President of the National Congress (Senate), Mr. Silvio Ovelar.

 

Both sides agreed that terrorism posed a grave threat to global peace and stability, stressing that there could be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever. Outlining a common desire to take an uncompromising stand against terror, India and Paraguay have agreed to cooperate to deal with the menace of terror.

 

During the Delegation Level Talks, the Paraguayan leadership decried the brutal terrorist attack that took place in Pulwama. The leadership of Paraguay said that they were on the same page as India as far as the issue of terrorism is concerned and extended heartfelt condolences to those who had lost their loved ones in the Pulwama terror attack. They stated that India could always count on Paraguay´s support in the fight against terrorism and in voicing India’s concerns on terrorism in the international fora.

 

Shri Naidu, during his interactions, particularly emphasized the scourge of cross border terrorism in India and stressed upon the need to take strong measures against terrorists, terror organizations, their networks and all those who encourage, support, finance and provide safe haven to terrorists and terror groups. 

 

Paraguay’s leadership affirmed its support for a UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism proposed by India. Furthermore, Paraguay assured that they would support India’s candidature to various UN and other multilateral bodies including the permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council.

 

The Vice President emphasized that Paraguay was an important partner of India in the Latin American and Caribbean region and said that the bilateral relations between the two nations have been showing an upward trend. He opined that India and Paraguay shared common values, interests, aspirations and promising futures. 

 

Observing that there was a feeling of mutual admiration and appreciation among the people of the two nations for each other, Shri Naidu underscored the deep faith in democracy that both nations held. 

 

Talks were held in a warm and cordial atmosphere when the two sides discussed bilateral, regional and multilateral issues of mutual interest.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that skill development should become a national mission. He lauded the valor, courage and commitment of Wing Commander, Abhinandan Varthaman and said that he has made the nation proud with his bravery and professional integrity in the face of adversity. He called Shri Abhinanadan and his family who have been serving the nation, a shining example in the service of the nation as he asked the younger generation to draw inspiration from him.

Addressing the gathering after laying foundation stone for the construction of Kaushal Bhawan, here today, Shri Naidu stressed up on the need to work as team India to build a stronger India, a more developed India, an India that was capable of defending itself against hostile forces and disruptive designs.

The world and especially South East Asia has numerous problems like poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and low employable skills. We should wage a war against these, he added.

Calling youth the agents for transformation, the Vice President asked the youth to upgrade their skill sets by using the opportunities made available by the government such as Skill India, Digital India, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna and others that were aimed at empowering youth to match the needs of the 21st century job market.

The Vice President called up on the Private sector to step in supporting government’s efforts skill the youth of India, especially the ones living in rural areas.

Expressing concern over the rising urban-rural divide, Shri Naidu wanted united efforts by all agencies including the private sector to create healthcare, rural employment, skill training facilities at rural areas at par with the urban areas.

Quoting Maharma Gandhi’s Nai Talim, the Vice President stressed that youth and children should not just be trained to acquire skills but should be taught to respect human labor and social harmony and tolerance. One must learn to respect every job, he added.

Shri Naidu said that training the youth and children on rural crafts by way of vocational training and empowering them to stand on their own should pave the way for Gram Swaraj and create the possibility of large-scale self-employment in rural and urban areas.

The Minister of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship and Petroleum & Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, the Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha, Smt. Meenakashi Lekhi and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address in English & Hindi:

""कौशल भवन का शिलान्यास करते हुए, मैं भारत के स्वर्णिम भविष्य के प्रति आशान्वित हूं। देश का भविष्य युवाओं के सपनों में आकार लेता है उनका पुरूषार्थ ही देश की नियति तय करेगा वही देश की संपदा है। आज इस शुभ अवसर पर मुझे अटल जी के प्रेरक कविता की पंक्तियां याद आती हैं। उन्होंने देश की भावी नियति के लिए नव दधीची युवाओं के पुरूषार्थ का आह्वाहन करते हुए लिखा था :

“आहुति बाकी यज्ञ अधूरा

अपनों के विध्नों ने घेरा

अंतिम जय का वज्र बनाने

नव दधीची हड्डियां गलाए

आओ फिर से दिया जलाएं”

India is a young, aspirational country.  65% of our population is below 35 years of age.  62% of our population is in the working age group of 15-59 years. We have a work force of 48 crores and more than a crore join the work force every year.

Today, we have a unique opportunity. There is a huge demographic dividend waiting to be realized. The challenge is to train and upgrade youth’s skill levels to enable them to effectively respond to rapid changes of the 21st century.

We cannot afford to lose this opportunity. Skills and knowledge are driving forces of economic growth and social development for any country.

Countries with higher levels and better standards of skills adjust more effectively to the challenges and opportunities in domestic and international job markets.

According to the various estimates, by 2022 there are going to be about 5 crore jobs in Retail Business sector, 1.42 crore in Health and Wellness, and more than 20 lakhs in Telecom sector.  According to a study conducted last year, in Analytics and Data Science disciplines alone 45% new jobs are estimated to be available.  About 65 lakh additional jobs will be created in the next 7 years in software sector, according to the recently approved Centre’s National Policy for Software Products.   There are opportunities.... there are jobs ..... there are human resources - all that we need to do is to equip people with requisite skill-sets to take advantage of the new openings in different sectors.  We have a demographic advantage with 65% of our population being below the age of 35 years.   It is a boon, of course.   But the challenge lies in making them skill-ready.  According to a report, less than 5% of our total workforce has undergone formal skill training compared to 68% in the UK, 75% in Germany, 52% in the USA, 80% in Japan and 96% in South Korea.   We are aiming to skill 40 crore people by 2022.  This is a big challenge and ambitious target.  We have to work in that direction dedicatedly.  Opportunities are there and so are challenges.  Let us understand them and make sustained efforts to achieve targets not only by the Central and State Governments but also the private sector.

Our efforts over last few years have begun to bear fruits now in improving the economy. Every prominent rating and ranking agency in the world like Moody’s or IMF and World Bank has not only commended our economic growth but has also considered our growth to be essential for overall growth in global economy.  Today, we are the fastest growing economy of the world with an average growth rate of 7.3% over the last four years. We are the sixth largest economy in the world and are poised to become a US $ 5 Trillion economy in the near future. This will be possible only when our youth contributes to our economy.

In the last four years we have been able to attract FDI worth US $ 250 billion. This shows the confidence the global investors have in Indian economy.  We have reached 77th position on Ease of Doing Business index from 142 in 2014.

India is now world’s second largest hub of Start Ups.  39000 new Start Ups have been registered during last four years. It is matter of added satisfaction that 44% of these Start Ups are registered in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns. This indicates that the benefits of our reforms are reaching the entrepreneurs of smaller cities.

We have improved our position in almost every global economic rating and ranking.  In the Global Innovation Index we have reached 57th position in 2018 from 76th in 2014. Our Start ups provide viable possibilities to global investors including the Alternative Investment Funds  that are meant for investment mainly in new businesses and Start Ups. In the last four years, the investment through such Alternative Investment Funds has increased 20 times to reach Rs. 80000 crores.  It indicates the confidence global investors have in our Start Ups.

It is important to nurture the talent of our youth to disrupt the status quo and lead radical innovations. Aligned with our growing economic profile, we have promoted skill development as a National Mission.

Empowering the youth by skill-building is a powerful tool in current times. It will enhance the efficacy and quality of the work for improved productivity and growth in the future.

इस स्थिति को सुधारने के लिए ही सरकार ने 2014 में एक अलग कौशल विकास विभाग की स्थापना की। 2015 में कौशल तथा उद्यम विकास के लिए नयी राष्ट्रीय नीति की घोषणा की गई। प्रधानमंत्री कौशल विकास योजना के तहत  युवाओं को प्रशिक्षित किया जाना है।

It gives me pleasure to see that various initiatives and interventions of the Government are empowering youth. Various programmes of the Ministry have ensured that training courses and modules are mapped as per local industry requirements. I am happy to learn that more than a crore youth are being imparted skill training annually under various programmes of the Government.  56 lakh youth have been trained under flagship Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna, since its inception.

Recognition of Prior Learning has been introduced to give formal recognition to prior informal skills and learning experiences of an individual. More than 10 lakh persons have been certified under this scheme after  short bridge courses.

Today, we have more than 550 Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKKs) across districts of the country which are state of the art model centers of skilling in courses relevant to the local industries.

Number of ITIs has increased by 40% in last four years to 15000, with corresponding increase in seats by 56%. Student enrollment has increased by 28% during the same period. The ITIs have been asked to develop courses in accordance with industry’s demands.

Training in futuristic skill sets like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analysis, Robotics, 3D Printing is being imparted under the Mission. This will help the trainees to make a head-start in remunerative global job market.

We have amended the Apprenticeship Act. The National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme has been launched to promote apprenticeship in industry.  The total number of apprentices engaged increased from 2.15 Lakhs in 2014 to 5.05 Lakhs in 2018.

An important part of National Skill Development Mission is to promote Vocational Education in Schools. Vocational education has been introduced in more than 9000 schools across the country. More than 7 Lakh students are annually getting trained on 73 accredited courses across 20 sectors.

इस संदर्भ में मेरा सुझाव होगा कि गांधी जी द्वारा प्रस्तावित नई तालीम से प्ररेणा ली जाय। जैसा कि गांधी जी का विचार था कि नयी तालीम से न केवल छात्रों को कौशल प्राप्त होगा बल्कि उनमें मानव श्रम के प्रति आस्था पैदा होगी और सामाजिक सौहार्द और सहिष्णुता भी पैदा होगी। मेरा सुझाव होगा कि खादी और ग्रामोद्योग आयोग के माध्यम से छोटे शहरों, कस्बों और ग्रामीण विद्यालयों में खादी ओर ग्रामीण उद्योगों, शिल्पों का प्रशिक्षण कराये जाने पर विचार किया जाय। इससे ग्रामीण और कस्बाई क्षेत्रों में बड़े पैमाने पर स्वरोजगार की संभावना पैदा होगी।

I am happy to learn that the Ministry has done a skill gap assessment of most of the States. This will help the trainees and training institutions to make choices of training courses accordingly. I believe that similar exercise to study global skill gaps is being undertaken.

As we aspire to exploit the job prospects in global market for our skilled man power, our training modules should be comparable with global benchmarks. With the massive expansion of training facilities, there is also a need to ensure quality of training, availability of quality training infrastructure, qualified faculty and state of the art  curriculum.

Also, we have to increase the placement/self-employment after the training. It is essential that after the training, the placement should be facilitated or the trainees should be guided to set up their own enterprises. 

यह आवश्यक है कि पाठ्यक्रम समाप्त करने के बाद युवाओं को रोजगार प्राप्त हो या उन्हें स्वरोजगार स्थापित करने में सहायता दी जाय। प्रशिक्षण के बाद का मार्गदर्शन और सहायता भी आवश्यक है।

सरकार द्वारा प्रारंभ की गई मुद्रा योजना की सफलता यह दिखाती है कि देश में स्थानीय स्तर पर उद्यम लगाने की अपार संभावना है। पिछले 4 वर्षों में 15 करोड़ लोगों को मुद्रा ऋण दिये गये जिसमें लगभग 30% ऐसे नये उद्यमी है जिन्होंने पहली बार बैंक ऋण प्राप्त किया है।     मैं आशा करूंगा कि प्रशिक्षण के दौरान युवाओं को वित्तीय सहायता के लिए सरकारी कार्यक्रमों और नीतियों के विषय में भी बताया जाय।

Young Friends,

India is poised for a big transition. Youth are the agents of this transformation. I call upon each one of you to use the available programmes and expanded opportunities.

India is transforming and reinventing itself rapidly, inspired by PM Modi’s call to you “Reform, Perform and Transform”.

I urge each one of you to keep learning and improve your skills. Be lifelong learners.

We should work as team India to build a stronger India, a more developed India, an India that is capable of defending itself against hostile forces and disruptive designs. Like we have demonstrated a few days ago in a fitting response to our neighbour’s inaction to check the rising tide of cross-border terrorism. Our fight is against terror in all its manifestations, not against any religion, as our External Affairs Minister made it clear in her address at the OIC meeting. The world and especially South East Asia has numerous problems like poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and low employability skills. We should wage a war against these.

मित्रों,

आज भारत 130 करोड़ आशाओं, अपेक्षाओं और संभावनाओं का देश है। यह नये अवसरों का देश है। यह कौशल भवन उन संभावनाओं और अवसरों का केंद्र होगा। मैं आशा करता हूं कि यह भवन राष्ट्रीय कौशल विकास मिशन की सफलता का स्मारक होगा। अपने वक्तव्य का अंत मैं, राष्ट्रकवि मैथिलीशरण गुप्त जी की कविता से करूंगा जिसमें हमारे युवाओं के लिए अमर संदेश है :-

            “नर हो न निराश करो मन को

            कुछ काम करो कुछ काम करो

            जग में रह कर निज नाम करो....”           

आपको आपकी भावी सफलताओं के लिए मेरी शुभकामनाऐं।

जय हिन्द।""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the education we impart in our schools, colleges and universities must lead to self discovery, enlightenment and awakening of an individual. He was addressing the gathering at the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of Andhra Vidyalaya College of Arts, Science & Commerce, in Hyderabad today. The Minister for Education, Telangana, Shri G. Jagdish Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

The Vice President said that by 2020, the median age in India will be just 28, compared to 37 in China and the US, 45 in Western Europe, and 49 in Japan. Demographics is a game changer in economic development and can transform the pace and pattern of economic growth, he added.

Shri Naidu said that investing in people through healthcare, quality education, jobs and skills helps build human capital. He further said that though India has made considerable gains in human development, it still grapples from challenges of illiteracy, big barriers to secondary schooling, low-quality public services, and gender discrimination. It is time for India to pursue a much more aggressive education plan, exploiting the new technology opportunities, he added.

The Vice President said that there should be renewed focus on gender equality and safety of women through gender sensitization and gender sensitization must begin at the home, schools and colleges. He urged the institution to do everything in its power to encourage more and more young women to avail opportunities of higher education.

Saying that even when jobs are available, candidates with the right skill set that fit the job are not available, the Vice President suggested to tackle this issue with the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna 2.0 which has been launched in October 2016 and aims to train 10 Million Youth over a period of 4 years.

Advising to pay attention to equity in access to education, the Vice President said that women and girls, Scheduled Castes and Tribes, differently-abled and minority groups need to have a barrier free and equitable access to higher education.

Quoting Swami Vivekananda's exhortation a hundred years ago - “Awake, arise and stop not till your goal is reached”, Shri Naidu said that this world is full of opportunities and one must seize them.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to participate in the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of Andhra Vidyalaya College of Arts, Science & Commerce, in Hyderabad today. 

Completion of 70 years is an important milestone in the journey of any institution. This journey of seven decades stands testament to the institution’s unwavering commitment to the cause of providing quality education.

I was informed that the A.V. Education Society was established in the year 1944, with an objective of extending educational opportunities to backward sections of the region. 

The society started A. V. College in 1968 to provide Under Graduate education to students in the region and later expanded to provide Post Graduate education.

In the last seven decades, the institution has produced many eminent Indians who have been doing great service to this country. It is noteworthy that many of its alumni are holding top positions in a number of organizations in India and abroad.

I am happy to know that Justice Subhash Reddy, Judge of the High Court of A.P; Capt. K. Usha, first woman Army Officer; Pullela Gopi Chand, National Coach, Badminton; Gagan Narang, Olympian and  Champion Shooter and several other achievers and successful professionals are alumni of this great institution. 

It is heartening to note that in its vision statement, the institution envisages the empowerment of individuals through the pursuit of excellence.

My dear sisters and brothers,

India is blessed with a huge demographic capital.

By 2020, the median age in India will be just 28, compared to 37 in China and the US, 45 in Western Europe, and 49 in Japan. 

Demographics is a game changer in economic development and can transform the pace and pattern of economic growth. 

I believe that it is this energetic, inventive and enterprising youth population that will write India’s glorious story of prosperity.

But a lot depends upon whether the bulge in working population can be properly educated and trained. India has to create enough jobs to employ the 10 million more people who are set to join the labor force every year.

India has to invest more and more efficiently in people.

Investing in people through healthcare, quality education, jobs and skills helps build human capital, which is key to supporting economic growth, ending extreme poverty, and creating more inclusive societies. 

Human capital is already the largest component of global wealth and one of the most crucial and fast growing components of India’s wealth. 

Many international agencies including the World Bank believe that India really has the potential to become the human resource capital of the world.

Though India has made considerable gains in human development, it still grapples from challenges of illiteracy, big barriers to secondary schooling, low-quality public services, and gender discrimination. 

The Government of India has undertaken a number of proactive initiatives for the betterment of Higher Education in India. 

From the SWAYAM Prabha programme which takes high quality educational content to the most backward areas using satellite communication through 32 DTH channels to the National Digital Library (NDL) which is a virtual repository of learning resources, a number of innovative initiatives now define India’s Higher Education potential.

Government has also embarked upon a mission to build several “Institutions of Eminence” (IoE) in public and private domain, so that they are rated among the best global institutions, propelling India to the status of being a favored destination to the world for Higher Education. 

We have also come up with a number of encouraging, out of the box ideas such as the Smart India Hackathon initiative that promotes innovation to find solutions for common problems faced by the society at large. 

It is time for India to pursue a much more aggressive education plan, exploiting the new technology opportunities including Massive Open Online Courses and virtual classrooms to the best possible extent.  

No country can achieve its potential and meet the daunting challenges of the 21st century without the full participation of working population, both women and men. 

Discrimination against women have a crippling impact on economic development. 

There should be renewed focus on gender equality and safety of women through gender sensitization. Gender sensitization must begin at the home, schools and colleges. 

I urge this institution to do everything in its power to encourage more and more young women to avail opportunities of higher education. 

It is time that we reassess and re-evaluate our approach and our strategy towards higher education. 

While we have considerably expanded our education system and more young people are in schools and colleges than ever before, there is clearly a crisis of quality. 

The learning attainment surveys speak of significant learning gaps. 

While India is home to a few world-class institutes that cater to higher education there are a large number of mediocre institutions that operate in our country.

A massive ranking exercise, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) was launched in 2015 for various categories of institutions such as Universities, Engineering colleges, Management Institutions etc. 

It is a decisive step in the direction of ushering in accountability and transparency in the higher educational institutions of India. 

Besides unemployment, India also faces a problem of unemployability. 

Even when jobs are available, candidates with the right skill set that fit the job are not available. 

To tackle this issue, the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna 2.0 has been launched in October 2016. It aims to train 10 Million Youth over a period of 4 years. Since its launch, it has trained and certified over 3.5 million young people.

It is high time that we focus on vocational education in schools in addition with improving learning outcomes in reading, writing and basic Mathematics.  

The quality of education both in terms of the curriculum and teaching methodology also needs to be redefined and refined. 

We need to ensure that our youth are ready for the job market. 

We also need to equip them with the entrepreneurial skills to become job creators. 

We have to fully exploit the limitless possibilities of the digital revolution we are experiencing now to fortify our higher education. 

We must prepare our youngsters to ride this wave of technology and to harness its potential to the best possible extent.

We also need to pay attention to equity in access to education. Women and girls, Scheduled Castes and Tribes, differently-abled and minority groups need to have a barrier free and equitable access to higher education.  

India is firmly committed to the ideals social justice and equitable opportunities to education become a crucial first step towards achieving social democracy.

For our higher Educational Institutions to become centres of global excellence, we must constantly strive to promote autonomy and quality and create an enabling environment for educational institutions to chart their own paths to excellence. 

We must build meaningful collaborations with the best educational institutions from around the globe and seek to learn and adapt the best practices followed by them in teaching, research and curriculum to suit our needs.

We have already launched the Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) an initiative to provide opportunities for Indian students & faculty to interact with the best academic and industry experts from around the world. 

Many more such partnerships have to be nurtured and fostered.

We also have to invest significant amount of resources in training teachers to make them highly competent. 

Our education sector is facing new challenges and we need teachers who are capable of rising to the occasion to effectively tackle these tests. 

While I agree that education should lead to employment and livelihood security, I do not believe that a job is the ultimate aim of education.

We must ensure that the education we impart in our schools, colleges and universities leads to self discovery, enlightenment and awakening of an individual. 

Education must empower the student in a holistic manner by ensuring all-round development of his/ her personality.

Education must build a strong character, inculcate ethical and moral values and also impart essential life skills, apart from leadership qualities.

Education should bring out the best in man and lead to his enlightenment and empowerment. 

It is an instrument for socio-economic transformation.

Education is the process of continuous, lifelong learning and does not end with the acquisition of a degree. 

Dear students,

Always aim and strive to achieve excellence in your chosen domain. 

Never get demoralized by temporary setbacks as every experience teaches a new lesson in life. 

Maintain equanimity in all situations, be confident but not arrogant.

This world is full of opportunities. You must seize them. As Swami Vivekananda exhorted a hundred years ago- “Awake, arise and stop not till your goal is reached”. 

I hope that AV College is successful in its quest to provide quality education. 

I urge you to do your best to mould global citizens who are well equipped to deal with any challenge that the competitive, fast paced world of the 21st century throws their way.

I wish each and every one of you the very best in your future endeavours.

Thank You!

Jai Hind!""

In a series of tweets, the Prime Minister said “In the journey of every nation there are moments that bring utmost pride and have a historic impact on generations to come. One such moment is today. India has successfully tested the Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile. Congratulations to everyone on the success of Mission Shakti.

Mission Shakti was a highly complex one, conducted at extremely high speed with remarkable precision. It shows the remarkable dexterity of India’s outstanding scientists and the success of our space programme.

Mission Shakti is special for 2 reasons:

(1) India is only the 4th country to acquire such a specialised & modern capability.

(2) Entire effort is indigenous.

India stands tall as a space power! It will make India stronger, even more secure and will further peace and harmony.”

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों,

 

आज, 27 मार्च्, कुछ ही समय पूर्व, भारत ने एक अभूतपूर्व सिद्धि हासिल की है।  भारत ने आज अपना नाम अंतरिक्ष महाशक्ति - स्पेस पावर - के रूप में दर्ज करा दिया है। 

 

अब तक दुनिया के तीन देश - अमेरिका, रूस और चीन - को यह उपलब्धि हासिल थी। अब भारत चौथा देश है, जिसने आज यह सिद्धि प्राप्त की है। हर हिन्दुस्तानी के लिए इससे बड़े गर्व का पल नहीं हो सकता है। 

 

कुछ ही समय पूर्व, हमारे वैज्ञानिकों ने अंतरिक्ष में, स्पेस में, तीन सौ किलोमीटर दूर, LEO - लॉ अर्थ ओरबिट - में एक लाइव सैटेलाइट को मार गिराया है।

 

LEO – लॉ अर्थ ओरबिट - में यह लाइव सैटेलाइट, जोकि एक पूर्व निर्धारित लक्ष्य था, उसे Anti-Satellite, (A-सैट) मिसाइल द्वारा मार गिराया गया है। सिर्फ तीन मिनट में, सफलतापूर्वक यह ऑपरेशन पूरा किया गया है। 

 

मिशन शक्ति - यह अत्यंत कठिन ऑपरेशन था, जिसमें बहुत ही उच्चकोटि की तकनीकी क्षमता की आवश्यकता थी। वैज्ञानिकों द्वारा सभी निर्धारित लक्ष्य और उद्देश्य प्राप्त कर लिए गए हैं। 

 

हम सभी भारतीयों के लिए यह गर्व की बात है कि यह पराक्रम भारत में ही विकसित Anti-Satellite (A-सैट) मिसाइल द्वारा सिद्ध किया गया है। 

 

सर्वप्रथम मैं मिशन शक्ति से जुड़े सभी DRDO वैज्ञानिकों, अनुसंधान-कर्ताओं तथा अन्य संबंधित कर्मियों को बधाई देता हूं, जिन्होंने इस असाधारण सफलता को प्राप्त करने में योगदान दिया। आज फिर इन्होंने देश का मान बढ़ाया है, हमें हमारे वैज्ञानिकों पर गर्व है। 

 

अंतरिक्ष आज हमारे जीवन-शैली का एक महत्वपूर्ण हिस्सा बन गया है। आज हमारे पास पर्याप्त संख्या में उपग्रह उपलब्ध हैं, जो अलग-अलग क्षेत्रों के विकास में अपना बहुमूल्य योगदान दे रहें हैं, जैसे कृषि, रक्षा, सुरक्षा, आपदा प्रबंधन, संचार, मौसम, नेवीगेशन, शिक्षा आदि। 

 

हमारे उपग्रहों का लाभ सभी को मिल रहा है, चाहे वो किसान हों, मछुआरें हों, विद्यार्थी हों, सुरक्षा-बल हों। दूसरी ओर चाहे वो रेलवे हो, हवाई जहाज, पानी के जहाजों का परिचालन हो, इन सभी जगह उपग्रहों का उपयोग किया जा रहा है।

 

विश्व में स्पेस और सैटेलाइट का महत्व बढ़ते ही जाने वाला है। शायद जीवन इसके बिना अधूरा हो जाएगा। ऐसी स्थिति में इन सभी उपकरणों की सुरक्षा पुख्ता करना भी उतना ही महत्वपू्र्ण है। 

 

आज की Anti-Satellite (A-सैट) मिसाइल भारत की सुरक्षा की दृष्टि से और भारत की विकास यात्रा की दृष्टि से देश को एक नई मजबूती देगा। मैं आज विश्व समुदाय को भी आश्वस्त करना चाहता हूं कि हमने जो नई क्षमता प्राप्त की है यह किसी के विरूद्ध नहीं है। यह तेज गति से आगे बढ़ रहे हिन्दुस्तान की रक्षात्मक पहल है। 

 

भारत हमेशा से ही अंतरिक्ष में हथियारों की होड़ के विरुद्ध रहा है और इससे इस नीति में कोई बदलाव नहीं आया है। आज का यह परीक्षण किसी भी तरह के अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कानून अथवा संधि-समझौतों का उल्लंघन नहीं करता है । हम आधुनिक तकनीक का उपयोग देश के 130 करोड़ नागरिकों की सुरक्षा एवं उनके कल्याण के लिए करना चाहते हैं। 

 

इस क्षेत्र में शांति और सुरक्षा का माहौल बनाने के लिए एक मजबूत भारत का होना आवश्यक है। हमारा सामरिक उद्देश्य शांति बनाये रखना है न कि युद्ध का माहौल बनाना। 

 

प्यारे देशवासियों,

 

भारत ने अंतरिक्ष क्षेत्र में जो काम किया है, उसका मूल उद्देश्य भारत की सुरक्षा, भारत का आर्थिक विकास और भारत की तकनीकी प्रगति है। आज का यह मिशन इन सपनों को सुरक्षित करने की ओर एक अहम कदम है, जो इन तीनों स्तंभों की सुरक्षा के लिए आवश्यक था।

 

आज की सफलता को आने वाले समय में एक सुरक्षित राष्ट्र, समृद्ध राष्ट्र और शांतिप्रिय राष्ट्र की ओर बढ़ते कदम के रूप में देखना चाहिए। यह महत्वपूर्ण है कि हम आगे बढ़ें और अपने आप को भविष्य की चुनौतियों के लिए तैयार करें। 

 

हमें भविष्य की चुनौतियों का सामना करने तथा अपने लोगों के जीवन-स्तर में सकारात्मक बदलाव लाने के लिए आधुनिक तकनीक को अपनाना ही होगा। सभी भारतवासी भविष्य की चुनौतियों का सामना आत्म-विश्वास से करें और सुरक्षित महसूस करें, यही हमारा लक्ष्य है।

 

मुझे अपने लोगों की कर्मठता, प्रतिबद्धता, समर्पण और योग्यता पर पूर्ण विश्वास है । हम निस्संदेह एकजुट होकर एक शक्तिशाली, खुशहाल और सुरक्षित भारत का निर्माण करें। 

 

मैं ऐसे भारत की परिकल्पना करता हूं जो अपने समय से दो कदम आगे की सोच सके और चलने की हिम्मत भी जुटा सके। 

 

सभी देशवासियों को आज की इस महान उपलब्धि के लिए बहुत बहुत बधाई। 

 

 धन्यवाद।

                All my CISF friends, who are engaged in the protection and security of the nation's property and honour!

All the brave family members present here today!

Ladies and gentlemen!

Heartiest congratulations to you all on the occasion of 50th Raising Day celebrations!

The completion of 50 years as an organization is a commendable feat. The CISF has been able to attain this height today due to the contribution made not only by the institution as a whole but also by all those great people who have headed it for that past 50 years and have worked relentlessly to take this institute to newer heights. They have worked for its human resource development too. Today we are celebrating 50 years or the Golden Jubilee. Congratulations to all those who have worked during the last 50 years to take this institution to such great heights. Some of them are present here today. They are extremely praiseworthy. 

But brothers and sisters,

Your accomplishment becomes all the more important because the neighbouring country is hostile. Although they are incapable of fighting a direct war, but different conspiracies within India get an impetus from that land that gives rise to different forms of monstrous terrorism; amidst such situations, it becomes all the more challenging to protect the nation and its resources. 

Just a short while ago, during the ongoing Parade, I could feel the zeal and determination that are necessary for building a glorious India. I congratulate the Parade Commander, and all the soldiers and officials who took part in the Parade for this grand presentation. Several friends have also received medals here today for their excellent service. I congratulate all of you for this. Besides, I also congratulate the winners of Police Medal and Jeevan Raksha Padak announced on the Republic Day this year.

Friends,

All of you associated with CISF, have played a crucial role in protecting the wealth of the nation. In order to safeguard the new and modern systems of India, in order to fulfil the country's hopes and aspirations, you are continuously moving forward. 

We know that there are several security arrangements and we have inherited these things like its formation, mechanism and structure from the British era. There are a very few institutions that have taken birth after Independence according to the needs. These were born in free India. These took birth as a result of the thinking of free India. These institutions were born to fulfil the dreams of independent India. And CISF is one of the important units among those. Therefore, its birth, nourishment, development, expansion etc. happened gradually in the form of progressive unfolding. This occasion of Golden Jubilee is extremely a proud moment for everyone especially those who have headed this institution and have helped in its growth.

Such an institution is created not just by approval of a file by the government or the Cabinet. It was the efforts of thousands of people over the 50 years. They have developed such an institution keeping in mind the needs of the people. And it became a great entity of faith for the nation. Therefore, no congratulatory word is enough for you. Rajesh Ranjan ji was saying -'it is pleasantly surprising that the Prime Minister has come to our event'. But I would rather say that I would have missed a lot of things if I hadn't come here. 

 

The constant penance of 50 years is not less. It's a great penance. You have to be alert for 365 days in a year. You have to keep your hands, legs and body ready to avert any calamity and save the nation. You all have to work in such difficult circumstances wherein just one or two incidents could end everything. This is not an easy task. I understand it completely because as the Prime Minister, even I receive a protective shield. But I am sorry to say that giving protection to a single person is not a difficult task compared to protecting an institution where about 30 lakh people come and go; or 8 lakh people come and go; where every face is new, every person has a different behaviour. So, protecting such a huge institution is lakhs of times more difficult than protecting a VIP. You are doing that! You are taking care of the institution.

It's not that you are just guarding the doors of an institute. But you are protecting India's path of development. You are instilling a new faith in India's journey for development. And as per my experience, the biggest hurdles that you face while serving is created by people like us - the politicians who consider themselves kings. They consider themselves to be VIPs. If your security personnel stops him and checks at Airports, his anger starts erupting. He starts insulting you. He might even say that he would see you! You seek forgiveness and try telling him that it was just your duty but he wouldn't budge. This is the VIP culture.

 

Let me narrate an incident. When I used to do party work, I had to travel throughout the country on a regular basis. Once there was a senior political leader with me. There are a few airports in our country wherein there is double security check due to high security - like Srinagar. It was once the same even in Guwahati. Now I am not aware of the situation there. The senior political leader with me was a well-known figure but the security personnel at the airport could not identify him. He started doing the routine checks according to his drill. As he was being checked, his temper started rising. He could not cool down even after sitting inside the aircraft. He was not talking to me. I tried to understand his psychology. The next time, when we had to visit another place, I asked him to come after me so that I checked-in first. What I did was, I went straight to the security check; your security guard was standing there. I went to him and raised both my hands in the air. Then I said – “brother, quickly finish the aarti ritual”. He said - ""but I know you"". I said - ""so what if you know me, until you finish the ritual of using your metal detector, I won't go"". Then I told the senior leader - ""why do you take these things to heart during the security check?"" Just take it as the aarti ritual. Feel proud of it. Let us cooperate with the security personnel.

Sometimes this VIP culture becomes a threat to security. I have the courage to say this from here because I too follow discipline but my discipline never comes in between. This is the duty of every citizen. You all are 1.5 lakh in number. Even though your strength increases to 15 lakhs, your job will be difficult unless the citizens are disciplined and cooperative. Therefore, on this Golden Jubilee year, I believe it is necessary to educate the citizens about the significance of this massive system. Hence, when I was inspecting the Parade, I was wondering what to talk to you about today. A thought entered my mind - to create a digital museum within the airports and metro stations. The details about the origin, development and expansion of CISF, the way they are serving the citizens and their expectations etc. can keep playing on screens. The 30 lakh people travelling by metro will watch it sometime or the other. About 7-8 lakh people coming to the airport will watch it sometime or the other. The people will realize that these people work for 24 hours a day. They should respect them and feel proud of them. Sensitization is necessary. The more the people are informed, the stronger will be the security forces. You have my complete support in pushing this task. 

Compared to the other central forces, the numbers of daughters are greater in CISF. They are certainly giving a new dimension to the strength of the country and I therefore congratulate those daughters and their parents for choosing this field. I especially congratulate that mother who has taken the responsibility of securing the path of development of the country by encouraging the daughters to wear the uniform. 

 

Friends,

The spirit of security and service with which you are moving ahead are extremely important. You all are responsible for safeguarding the entire modern infrastructure being built - ports, airports, expansion of the metro and big industries etc. This powerful force of more than 1.5 lakh security personnel is striving to provide a safe and secure environment to the Indians and people visiting India from around the world. 

Friends,

Everyone feels completely safe in airports and metro. This has been possible because of your dedication, alertness and the public's faith in you. There is an ongoing expansion work for both airports and metro services. We are moving towards becoming the largest nation providing such services in both these fields. 

Friends,

Several times, I have got the opportunity to travel by metro. I have seen how hard you all have to work. You have to constantly keep an eye on the people and their belongings for hours. The common man who travels by metro or flight can see your hard work too. But sometimes there are a few people who under-estimate your work. They feel that your work is limited to checking every person. 

 

Friends,

It is essential for the nation to know that all the security personnel of CISF are not just associated with the job of checking but with every aspect of security and human sensitivity. 

Friends,

Your contribution has also always been commendable during the natural disasters. Last year during the Kerala floods, your friends have saved thousands of lives by engaging day and night in rescue operations. Not only in the country but whenever the humanity had been threatened abroad, the CISF had always fulfilled its responsibility. Your contribution after the Nepal and Haiti earthquakes has been appreciated by the international community. Moreover, I am told that you are playing a significant role in uniting those children with their families who get separated from their families during journeys. Similarly, you are responsible for providing a safe environment to the daughters. Due to all these reasons you have garnered the faith of the entire nation. 

Friends,

Today, on this important occasion as we have reached a significant milestone, we should also commemorate our colleagues who have given supreme sacrifice for their duty, for the protection of our country; who have been martyred for the protection of our country. You have given the supreme sacrifice for protecting the country, for preserving our invaluable heritage and wealth from those forces that promote terrorism and violence. Be it CISF, CRPF or the other armed forces, we are able to look forward to our dream of a New India due to your dedication and sacrifice. So far, more than 35 thousand Police friends, including the 4000 martyrs from the central police forces have laid down their lives. I offer my homage to all the martyrs. 

But I would like to tell the people associated with the Defence forces that I emotionally feel that the people in Khaki uniforms; their hard work has not received so much respect and honour as it should have got in the country. It has not received enough recognition from the common people. So, for the first time since Independence, a Prime Minister had advocated from the ramparts of Red Fort to appropriately commemorate the martyrdom of more than 35 thousand policemen. I wanted to do that because the ordinary citizens are not aware of the reality. They judge the entire system based on the impression that is created by the behaviour of maybe a particular constable towards them. 

It is important for the country to enhance the glory, prestige and honour of our security forces more and more. The establishment of the Police Memorial is a part of that. And I would like the school students to visit the Memorial and know those who have sacrificed their lives for us. We should keep on putting efforts in this direction. All your families too sacrifice for the security of the nation. It is difficult to put it in words. And I am glad that while I was travelling in an open Jeep, I got the opportunity to meet the three generations. Here, the three generations of your family are present. The elderly ascetic people too are present. Today some retired people are also present here on this occasion. I have had the opportunity to meet them too. I salute all the families because the sacrifices of these families give strength to those who are on duty. 

Friends,

You keep standing on your front without wavering in any season - summer, winter or rains. There are several festivals like Holi, Diwali, Eid for the nation but for you, your duty becomes your festival. The families of the security personnel are also like the others. They have dreams and aspirations. They too have doubts and apprehensions. But when it comes to the security of the nation, they overcome every obstacle....... (Audio interrupted)....

 

.......There should be a full-day drill programme for different units. A protocol similar to 'blue-book' should be prepared so that we can prepare the people for it. We can move ahead on similar lines. We should do another thing. A separate Task Force can be created within CISF. There should be a real time study and monitoring of how the terrorists are looking for new modus operandi, how they are operating in new ways and the types of technologies they are using. The terrorists can misuse the gas pipelines and turn it into a catastrophe. Such things are happening around the world. We need to develop our systems by studying the equipment etc. used by the terrorists in the world. It would be better if we have such a dedicated Task Force for this study. And this study has to be done globally. Now there are no limits for terrorism. Terrorism is not confined to thousand kilometres or two thousand kilometres. They can be anywhere in any corner of the world. This is a challenge for humanity. Therefore, the challenge for your work is greater.

I would like to assure you that there will not be anything lacking on my behalf ever in fulfilling your needs and expectations. Once again, on the occasion of Golden Jubilee I congratulate you all for taking this institution to such great heights and for your contribution towards this institution. I also congratulate you all on the occasion of Golden Jubilee for arousing the belief in the people apart from ensuring the security of the nation. My best wishes to you all. And I believe that we will not leave any stone unturned in fulfilling the dreams of the country. With this spirit, my heartiest congratulations to my soldier brothers, their families and the great people who have carried this institution forward. With that I end my speech.

Say aloud with me everyone, whether in uniform or not! Everyone say -

 

Bharat Mata Ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, attended the 50th Raising Day celebrations of Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF), at Indirapuram in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.

The Prime Minister reviewed the parade of the CISF personnel. He presented the service medals for distinguished and meritorious services. He laid wreath at the Martyr’s Memorial and signed the visitor’s book.

Addressing the CISF personnel, the Prime Minister congratulated the forces for its Golden Jubilee. He praised the role of CISF in safeguarding and protecting the vital institutions of the country. He added that the responsibility of safeguarding the modern infrastructure built for New India is in the safe hands of CISF.

The Prime Minister urged the citizens to cooperate with the security personnel.  VIP culture creates hurdle in security architecture. Hence, it's important that the citizens cooperate with the security personnel, PM said. To create awareness amongst the general public regarding the role and functions of CISF, Prime Minister suggested the idea of starting digital museums at airports and metros, showcasing the work of CISF.

Hailing the role of CISF in securing the critical infrastructure of the country, Prime Minister said that the force is also involved in disaster response, ensuring safety of women and many other activities. In this context, Prime Minister spoke about the disaster relief operations of CISF during Kerala floods and also during Nepal and Haiti earthquake

The Prime Minister said that his government is committed towards ensuring the safety of its security forces. In this context he mentioned about the initiatives of the Government to modernize the forces and the actions taken for their welfare.

Stating that duty is the festival for the armed forces, Prime Minister said that the role of CISF has increased, due to the challenges posted by terrorism. He added that his government is committed towards eliminating terrorism.

The Prime Minister said that the National Police Memorial is a dedication to the valour and sacrifices made by the police and paramilitary forces. He said the monuments like National War Memorial and National Police Memorial will create awareness amongst the citizens regarding the contributions of security forces. He hailed the efforts of CISF in inducting many women soldiers into its force

As India grows, the roles and responsibilities of CISF will also grow commensurately, PM said.

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

The successful and popular Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath ji, my Cabinet colleague Shri Mahesh Sharma ji; the people of Bihar's Buxar are also associated with this event, hence, the Power Minister of India from Buxar, Shri R.K Singh ji, our Minister present in Buxar, Shri Ashwini Choubey ji, MLA Tejpal Nagar ji, Pankaj Singh ji, Sister Bimla Solanki ji, Virendra Singh ji, Vijendra Singh ji and my zealous brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers. Your excitement in worth looking at! I have a lot of respect for your enthusiasm and love. My dear brothers and sisters of Noida, you are raising the slogan of 'Modi-Modi' here while some people are losing their night's sleep. 

Friends,

There was a time when Noida and Greater Noida were synonymous with looting government’s wealth because of new scams related to authority, tender and land allocation. Earlier such news related to Noida were quiet prevalent. Isn't it? Hope you didn't mind it. But is it the truth or not? Today Noida and Greater Noida are known for development, projects and new employment opportunities. My nation, my Uttar Pradesh is actually transforming and moving ahead.

Brothers and sisters,

Today, Noida is developing as a major hub of Make in India. Today India has reached number two in mobile phone manufacturing in the world; Noida has played a big role in it. Prior to 2014, there were only two factories in the country that manufactured mobile phones and today nearly 125 factories are manufacturing mobile phones in the country. The stark contrast between 2 and 125! Of these, several factories are located in Noida. Besides mobiles, there are several companies of electronic items like T.V and fridge. They have created lakhs of new employment opportunities for young friends. 

Friends,

Today I am present amidst you all in Noida to dedicate all those projects that promise to make your lives easier. Moreover, the foundation stones of important projects to transform Western U.P and Bihar have been laid a short while ago. I congratulate the people here for the metro running between Noida City Centre and Noida Electronic City. 

Friends,

The country's largest airport is being constructed in Jewar in order to improve the connectivity here. Several processes related to it are being completed at a rapid pace. This will connect Noida to other cities via airways. Then the people will not have to go to Delhi. I believe that the Jewar airport will bring a golden opportunity for Western UP.

I am extremely pleased to inform you that in the next few weeks, flights will begin to take off from Bareilly under the UDAN scheme. The terminal building and other related works have been completed for this. 

Friends,

Under the UDAN scheme with the objective of 'Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik' (let the common citizen of the country fly), so far 120 routes have been started. Due to this scheme, several tier-2 and tier-3 cities of the country now have air connectivity. This is also boosting the economy of the cities. 

Friends,

Modern infrastructure related to electricity is also essential for industrial development. The foundation stones of two more major power plants have been laid from here. One plant is being set up in Khurja, Bulandshahr of UP and the other one in Bihar's Buxar. The Khurja plant is being built at a cost of more than Rs.12 thousand crores and the Buxar thermal plant at a cost of nearly Rs.10 thousand crores. I can see the huge number of friends who have joined us today from Buxar through the video conference. I greet them from here and congratulate them on this auspicious occasion. The Thermal plant that is being set up in Buxar, is a part of the Prime Minister's package announced in 2015 and our vision to make Eastern India the growth engine of the country.

Brothers and sisters,

On the completion of these two plants, UP and Bihar will have surplus electricity. With the help of the Khurja plant, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh will also get electricity along with UP. Similarly, with the help of the Buxar plant, the electricity supply to the Eastern India including Bihar will improve. Another major advantage of it will be that the industries in the states too will receive electricity according to their needs. Electricity is the first need of any industry that is being set up. 

Friends,

Our government is working in many areas keeping in view the country's energy needs in the 21st century. Previous governments did not prioritize it. Yesterday I have seen an example of how the power sector was ignored in the country and the energy requirements of the country were ignored. 

The educated youngsters present here will understand it better. Yesterday the expansion work of the Panki Power project had started in Kanpur. But friends, you will be shocked to know that 40-50 years old machinery was being used in the Panki project. Those machines had become obsolete. Their condition had become similar to that of the Congress. Consequently, the electricity generated used to cost Rs.10 per unit. Just imagine! Today we are producing electricity with solar energy at Rs2 per unit or Rs.3 per unit while at that time electricity was being produced at a rate of Rs.10 per unit. Who was getting benefitted out of it? Yet it was going on. 

Friends,

This attitude of the previous governments had taken a toll on the condition of the power sector of the country. The people of the country cannot forget those days when the breaking news flashing on television channels used to be - 'only 2-3 days' coal left in the power plants'. During this period of mismanagement in the power sector, power grids used to fail and the states used to be plunged in darkness. India felt embarrassed in the international arena. Our government has worked with a new approach and new policies to improve the power sector of the country. We focused on 4 things and have worked at 4 different levels - production, transmission, distribution and connection. If there is no production of electricity, if the transmission and distribution system is not strong enough, then howsoever we talk of providing connection, electricity cannot reach every household.

Therefore, after the formation of the government in 2014, first of all, we emphasized on increasing the production of electricity. Work began towards electricity generation through solar energy, hydro power, coal energy, nuclear energy and so on. The coal allocation that was once a part of a scam of crores of rupees, our government has now created a transparent and modern system for the auction of the same coal. While ensuring energy security for the country, we had set a target of adding 175 Gigawatt renewable energy by 2022. Working towards this goal, so far 75 Gigawatt of renewable energy has already been added. 

Friends,

The government has also increased the investment in the field of electricity transmission as a result of which there has been a tremendous increase in the country's transmission network. Consequently, today the nation has not only a safe and balanced grid but we have also fulfilled the dream of 'One Nation One Grid'. And now we are moving towards the solar energy. Brothers and sisters, neither my dreams are small nor do I indulge in petty things. Our dream is - 'One World, One Sun, and One Grid'. This dream will definitely come true one day!

Friends,

Kindly listen to what I am about to say. It will be extremely useful. I am going to quote a few statistics. These statistics are really powerful. Will you listen to it carefully? Will you remember it? Sure?If you remember just this, you won't have to think about the future. You will be able to make the right choice easily. Shall I tell you? Will you remember it?

See, from 1950 to 2014 i.e. within about 65 years, a capacity of about 2.5 lakh Megawatts was developed. How much capacity and in how many years? 2.5 lakh Megawatts in 65 years! Since the time you have chosen me - friends! You will be surprised to know that on one hand are 65 years while on the other just 5 years! It has not even been 5 years after I have come to power and our government has created a capacity of more than 1 lakh Megawatts. 2.5 lakhs in 65 years and 1 lakh in 5 years! Now just imagine - if those old and exhausted people had run the government then how many decades would have passed? But now the 'New India' is striding ahead with a new momentum. 

Brothers and sisters,

Due to the years of neglect of the country's power sector, this sector had become weak. As a result, whatever electricity that was being produced was not reaching the people. Our government has tried to fix this issue. We have worked on the 'UDAY' scheme. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana has been implemented for the villages in particular and for the cities - the IPD scheme i.e. Integrated Power Development Scheme.

Due to the efforts of the government, the electricity distribution within the country is also improving. Amidst these reforms, our government has achieved its goal of delivering electricity to every village of the country. There were more than 18000 villages where electricity was not available since independence. We have brought electricity to those villages.

Likewise, under the Saubhagya Yojana, we have started a campaign to connect every household with electricity. Under this scheme, so far, 2.5 crore households have been given free electricity connections. 2.5 crore families were still living in the dark even after 70 years of independence. Our government has delivered electricity to them.

Brothers and sisters,

Tell me, are you happy that the 2.5 crore families that were living in the dark now have electricity? Are you happy? Who did this? Who did this task? This is where you go wrong. No, Modi didn't do it. The houses of 2.5 crore families now have light because of the power of your vote. It was possible due to you.

If you were not with me and of there was no strong government in Delhi that is concerned about the welfare of the poor, these 5 years would have passed and the lives of the 2.5 crore families would have been spent in darkness. There wouldn't have been anyone to raise any question. Therefore, the credit goes not to Modi but to the 125 crore Indians, i.e. to you all.

Apart from strengthening the power sector, the government has also emphasized on the modern methods to reduce the demand of power. These modern methods not only save electricity but also reduce the electricity bills of the people. We have worked towards reducing the electricity bills of the middle class families. Due to the efforts of the government, the LED bulbs that used to cost Rs.300-350 in February 2014 now cost Rs.40-50 after I came. Why did it happen? There were middlemen everywhere. Modi cracked down on the middlemen and the cost of the bulb came down from Rs.300-350 to Rs.40-50. 

Tell me, all those who were looting and whose businesses had been shut down would abuse Modi or not? Whether they would conspire against Modi or not? So, who will protect me? A person protected by the 125 crore Indians is never afraid of the middlemen.

So far, about 150 crore LED bulbs have been distributed in the country by the government and private companies. As per my estimate, with this, people are saving about Rs.50 thousand crores annually in their electricity bills. You decide! Savings of Rs.50 thousand crores annually by the citizens of the country just by the removal of the middlemen is such a big task that has been accomplished! 

Brothers and sisters,

Another significant task has been accomplished in Noida today. A grand campus of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Institute of Archaeology has been set up here to link our country's rich cultural heritage and civilization with research. Spread over an area of 25 acres, this complex is built in line with India's glorious past. Now research scholars and students here will be able to study every aspect such as India’s rich heritage, our spirituality, our temples, our scriptures, our pilgrimage zones, our crafts and art in great detail with the help of the modern facilities. 

Friends,

Archaeology is like excavating the pages of history from underneath the earth and also unearthing the fragrance of history from the stones and bringing forth the historical truth through scientific evidence. Archaeology is of great importance to our glorious nation that has seen a long period of British rule as well as several attacks by foreign forces and has seen the destruction of our ancient heritage in those attacks. 

Some of you might be aware of my visit to Varanasi yesterday. There, I have laid the foundation stones of development projects related to Kashi Vishwanath Dham. Around the temple of Bhole Baba, several houses had sprung up. Those of you who might have visited Kashi Vishwanath would know how narrow streets passed through it. I don't know if God felt suffocated in such conditions. That place was in a mess! The people there have elected me as their MP. So, I thought of doing something for them and I started right away.

Now go and see. We acquired those 300 properties around Bhole Baba’s temple and started demolishing them. As the houses were being demolished, the temples started getting exposed. People had built walls and turned the temples into houses, into their bedrooms. As the walls were being demolished, 200-250 years old best Archaeological pieces came out. We found 40 temples! 

You decide! Before me, those running the Ministry of Culture and the department of Archaeology would have been so lackadaisical. This is a living example of the same. Now, even if a single rock is touched, the people from Archaeology department will nab those persons. But in that complex of Bhole Baba, people had taken over 40 temples for 40 or 50 years! They might have the blessings of political leaders. Now tell me, will those who lost their houses love or praise Modi? But should Modi work for his image enhancement or for the welfare of Bharat Mata? Modi doesn't work with the aim that people will hail him. Modi works for the enhancement of the country's image. Now these temples are being preserved and restored. But you have seen the kind of politics that has been played. 

Friends,

Those playing politics are the same people who don't accept the facts revealed before the world with the help of archaeology. These are the same people who, for their self-interests, don't care about the preservation of such ancient heritage and rituals. There are multiple examples of the same. My brothers and sisters of Noida! This is relevant to you. I want to tell you. Do you want to hear it? If you are in mood, even I am also in mood to tell you.

You will find several examples when the previous governments have given permission to buildbungalows and farm houses next to buildings of archaeological significance just to reward their claque and sycophants. You were not aware that these things used to happen, isn't it? There are several such cases in Delhi itself. If my friends in the media start looking around andstart investigating the matter, the truth will come out. Whether you will be able to show that on screen or not, whether you will be able to print it or not is a different issue. That might be your compulsion but at least find the truth. Try to find out who were those sycophants for whom such special arrangements were made. 

Friends,

Since the previous governments had such an attitude, it will be wrong to expect seriousness from them in serious subjects like archaeology. I hope that following the vision of Deen Dayal ji, this institution will play a major role in linking our past to the present and the future. I have had the opportunity to do virtuous work in your campus for Deendayal Upadhyay, who gave economic and social vision for the development of the country.

Friends,

You all are well aware of how the previous governments had worked. The situation was such that half the population was deprived of gas connection and half the population didn't have bank accounts. More than half the families didn't have toilets. Several schemes were formulated and left incomplete. Consequently, India fell behind those nations that got their independence at the same time as India and had started their development journey along with India. 

Brothers and sisters,

After 2014, when you had given me the opportunity to serve you as your Prime Servant, we have been moving forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. 

Friends,

Our government is fighting against the culture of corruption with a heavy hand and schemes are being formulated in entirety for the welfare of the common man. Therefore, today, every corrupt person has a problem with Modi. Such people are engaged in the competition of abusing this Chowkidar. They decide in the morning that if one person hurls 15 abuses at Modi, the other will hurl 16. They believe that abusing will help them to garner votes. Moreover, their morale has plunged to such levels that they have started going against the nation in the process of opposing Modi. 

Friends,

Today India is walking on the path of a new culture and new policy. After the Uri attacks, India taught the terrorists a lesson in the same language that they understood with surgical strikes. You tell me, did I take a correct step or not? Shouldn’t have I done it? Do you accept a government that is in a deep slumber? Would you accept if the Chowkidar slept? Do you want an alert and awake Chowkidar or not? Do you want a Chowkidar that makes the nation victorious or not? 

Brothers and sisters,

They have been demanding proof after Uri! After the Pulwama attack, the work done by our soldiers had never been done for the past several decades. Our brave soldiers have thrashed the terrorists inside their house. The terrorists didn't expect such retaliation from India. They thought that Modi had conducted surgical strike last time, so even this time he would do something similar. So they placed tanks and what not on the borders. They made all the arrangements on the border but we reached via air. Just see the fun - we had quietly made the arrangements. It was 3.30 am at night. Why to wake the people up? 

But this was such a major event that at 3.30 am, Pakistan lost its sleep. We were quite. We thought - 'let's wait and watch'. Pakistan was so frightened that by 5 am it started tweeting -'Modi has thrashed us! Modi has thrashed us!' We didn't give this news to the world. They had informed the world about it. 

During the surgical strike, we had informed the nation and this time as we followed the new methodology, they started sobbing. They were thinking about continuing with their attacks and proxy wars on India and expected India to be silent. The previous governments are responsible for this image of India that has been created before the country's enemies. These 'remote controlled' governments had such an attitude that the enemies were habituated to it.

Friends,

India can never forget that terrorists from Pakistani soil had launched terrorist attacks in Mumbai on 26/11 i.e., 26.11.2008. Could we ever forget? At that time wasn't there a crying need to take some steps? The world would have stood beside us or not? It requires will power friends! We had all evidences against the terrorists in Pakistan. All the evidences were proving them guilty. 

But what did India do? How did it retaliate? We also have the information that at that time our army, our air force and navy were ready to take revenge.

The blood of our defence forces was boiling, but Delhi got cold feet. Permission was not granted to our defence forces. Their hands and legs were shackled. Can we fight against terrorism with such shackles? If we ask the soldiers with fretters to attack the enemies, will they be able to do that? Could the nation be protected in this way? Should we be soft towards the country's enemies? 

Friends,

This was the reason that terror attacks across the country continued even after the Mumbai attacks. Recall - in 2010, there was a bomb blast in a bakery in Pune. In the same year, there was a bomb blast in a Ghat of Varanasi. In 2011, there were bombings in Mumbai again in Opera House, Zaveri Bazar and Dadar. In the same year, there were blasts outside Delhi High Court. 

Similarly, in 2013, there was a bomb blast in a crowded market of Hyderabad. There had been bombings one after the other and thousands of innocent people were being killed and injured. These terror attacks too had a link across the border. But what did the previous government do? Those people didn't change their policy at all. They only changed their Home Ministers. Should the policy change or the Home Minister? 

Friends,

Had the previous government shown its power and given a befitting reply to the terrorists in their language, then today the terror wouldn't have grown to such gigantic levels. After the 2016 surgical strike and the airstrike of February this year, the terrorists have understood that this is not the old India. 

After the action taken by India, they are scared. The defence forces of India, the brave soldiers are doing their job but as the citizens of the country, it is our responsibility to remain alert. We should defeat every such force that is trying to divide the nation and is conspiring attacks against India. We must keep an eye on such people too.

Brothers and sisters,

The citizens of the country should pay attention to one more thing. Today there are people within the country who consider themselves as great political leaders, who once were in power. They are speaking such language which is empowering the enemies. These people are giving controversial statements. Questions are being raised against the bravery of the Indian soldiers while Pakistan is celebrating it. Whether the public should show these people the right path or not? Will you show them the right direction?

Brothers and sisters,

What kind of people are they? Identify them. Identify this 'split-up' gang. Pakistan itself had made a statement; in the beginning Pakistan only tweeted that Indian forces had thrashed them in their territory. This is their statement. By 7-8a.m. in the morning, a few idiots in our country had started - where is Balakot? Etc. You must have seen it. It was on television. You can go and see on YouTube. It was there in online magazines. It was not even 3-4 hours after the incident. 

Pakistan was saying - 'we have been attacked. Modi came, thrashed us and went back!' while these people here had started asking at 7-8a.m. in the morning -'Is Balakot in India or in Pakistan?' 'Is Balakot on Indian border?' 'Is Balakot on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir or close to our Kashmir?' Investigation was going on and Pakistan was wailing whereas these people here were trying to help them. These people here were ready to mislead the country. Three hours later when it was confirmed that indeed Modi had gone there and came back, it was then that they fell silent. Otherwise for the 4-5 hours they had been going on with the same questions.

What is more! The Indian army was telling this; Pakistan was crying; should there be any doubt in the minds of the Indians? Should there be doubt in the minds of those whose veins have Indian blood? Should that person doubt who loves the Indian tricolour? Should that person doubt who says 'Bharat Mata ki Jai'? Who are those people who doubt? Will you trust such people?

Therefore I keep on saying brothers and sisters that we have been relentlessly working towards strengthening the foundation of New India since 2014. We have worked towards fulfilling the needs of the country and delivering the basic amenities to the people. Now, it is time to fulfil the aspirations of the people. We have laid the foundation stone of New India over the last 5 years and now in the coming years we will build a glorious India on it. We will build such an India that is successful, capable and secure.

Friends,

The world that is witnessing the power of New India; the visible changes in the policies and work culture that are being witnessed; who is behind all that? You are behind it, the power of 125 crore Indians and your blessings! With this belief that your blessings will always be upon me, with this spirit, I congratulate you all from the bottom of my heart. Thank you! Say along with me-

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

With both your fists in the air, say loudly- 

Vande Mataram!

Vande Mataram!

Vande Mataram!

 

Thanks a lot.

Ganga Maiya ki Jai!

Ganga Maiya ki Jai!

Before beginning, I would like you to say - 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' thrice. I would urge you to say it aloud by raising both your fists in the air so that even the soldiers standing at the borders can hear. Say it thrice!

Bharat Mata Ki Jai for Mighty India!

Bharat Mata Ki Jai for a victorious India!

Bharat Mata Ki Jai for the brave soldiers!

 

Governor of Uttar Pradesh Shri Ram Naik ji; the popular and enthusiastic Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Shri Yogi Adityanath, the Deputy Chief Minister; my colleague in the Parliament, our mentor and  senior leader, Respected Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi ji; Ministers of the UP Government, Bhai Satish ji and Satyadev ji; State President of Bharatiya Janata Party and my colleague in the Parliament Dr. Mahendra Pandey Ji; Mr. Devendra Singh Ji, Mayor Pramila Ji and my dear brothers and sisters of Kanpur who have come here in large numbers to shower their blessings.

Yesterday I was flagging off the Metro in Nagpur and today I am inaugurating the Metro project in Kanpur.

Brothers and sisters,

I salute the land of Kanpur which is situated at the banks of Mother Ganga. Kanpur has shaped the lives of several brave-hearts and sons since the freedom struggle to an independent India. Kanpur has inspired many freedom fighters like Nana Peshwa, Tantia Tope and Rani Lakshmibai. Similarly, Kanpur has provided a direction to the lives of Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji, Late Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, and the incumbent President Ramnath Kovind ji. 

Friends,

You all have built this city as an important industrial city with its labour force and strength. You have given the identity of 'Manchester of East' to Kanpur. I have got the opportunity to be present among you all to further strengthen this identity, the day-to-day life of Kanpur, the business here as well as to give strength to the enterprises here. A short while ago, projects worth thousands of crores of Rupees related to the development of Kanpur and Uttar Pradesh have been inaugurated and foundation-stones have been laid. All these projects are associated with various facilities like traffic, electricity, new enterprises, cleanliness of Ganga, cleanliness of the city, and giving houses to the poor. Besides, the metro lines in Lucknow and Agra have also been dedicated and the foundation stone has been laid in Kanpur's land today. All the work here for development is going to bring a major change in the lives of the people of Uttar Pradesh.

Brothers and sisters,

Kanpur is an industrial city and a good electricity supply system is its priority. You all are well aware of the condition of electricity supply in Uttar Pradesh earlier. Now the way Yogi ji's government has worked on electricity, the people here and the entrepreneurs have got rid of the electricity related issues. The Panki Power project is an example of how politicians had played politics with electricity. One unit of this project was set up 52 years back. How many years back? People of Kanpur must remember these things. The first unit of this project was set up how many years back? And the second unit was set up 43 years back. Even the machines get worn out after working for so long. As a result, 1 unit of electricity used to cost Rs.10 and it was also consuming more coal. It was important to change this situation.

Friends,

The extension work of Panki Power Project at a cost of approximately Rs.6000 crores has begun from today. The electricity that will be produced will be available at less than half the price and will also cut on the pollution. And brothers and sisters of Kanpur! You all are aware of the way we work. Isn't it? We ensure that the project, whose foundation stone has been laid, is inaugurated too. This means within 3 years, when this factory will be completed, we will also inaugurate it. 

Brothers and sisters,

Our government is emphasizing upon distributing the electricity to every household besides helping the enterprises. Under the Saubhagya scheme, so far more than 75 lakhs people in UP have been provided with free electricity connections. If we talk only about Kanpur, more than 1.5 lakh households have been provided with free electricity, removing darkness from the lives of the people. The government is trying to ensure that farmers and the ordinary citizens receive sufficient electricity. I am astonished as to how the government used to be run earlier. In an industrial city like Kanpur, 1.5 lakh houses used to be shrouded in darkness after dusk. If those governments had the intent of doing something for the welfare of the poor, then this darkness would have been eliminated long ago. 

Friends,

Let me give you an example of their lack of intent with the help of Kanpur city. You have seen for yourself, how thousands of crores of rupees had been wasted in the name of cleaning Mother Ganga. Who took away that money? Did that go waste or into someone's pocket? But brothers and sisters, the government's treasury became empty, yet Mother Ganga didn't become cleaner. Isn't it true or not? Things started changing, when in 2014, the people of India especially the people of Uttar Pradesh had given us the opportunity to serve the nation. Things started getting better after that. We are day and night engaged in the task of making Mother Ganga clean from Gangotri to Ganga Sagar with complete commitment, dedication and devotion. Under the Namami Gange Mission, work on about 275 projects is underway across the country, of which more than 50 projects are in U.P alone at the banks of river Ganga.

Friends,

Looking at the condition of Ganga in Kanpur, people used to say that it was impossible to change the situation. But our government assured the nation that the impossible can be turned into something possible. For that a strategy was framed and worked upon. A massive campaign has been started by our government to divert and treat the waste water and the effluent from the houses and industries flowing into Mother Ganga in Kanpur. One of the largest drains of Asia that was directly flowing into Mother Ganga has been stopped. Several projects related to treatment of the sewage generated from the households and the cleanliness and beautification of Ghats have either been inaugurated or the foundation stones have been laid. 

Friends,

Under the Namami Gange project, our government has framed a special scheme for the leather industry. Under this scheme, the foundation stone of a huge plant to treat the waste water being produced from the leather industries has been laid today. With this, everyday 2 crore litres of waste water flowing into Ganga will be prevented. 

Friends,

Our government is not only protecting the old and existing industries but also encouraging the growth of new enterprises in Kanpur and the entire U.P. The Defence Corridor started in U.P will benefit Kanpur the most. Kanpur will get a boost. The environment of investment is becoming more favourable because Yogi ji has taken steps to curtail the criminal activities and is promoting the development of modern infrastructure. A network of roads, highways, expressways, railways and airways is being laid throughout U.P. At the same time, metro rail facilities are being developed in the cities. Several metro projects in U.P. including the Kanpur metro project have been approved by the central government. On the completion of the Kanpur Metro project, the traffic system here will have an unprecedented transformation.

Today with the help of technology, the second phase of the Lucknow Metro has been inaugurated. With this, now the metro will run on a 23 km route in Lucknow. Similarly, the foundation stone of the metro track has been laid in Agra. The Metro rail in Agra will not only make the lives of the people easier but will also boost the tourism.

Friends,

Out government is striving hard to provide every facility to the city of Kanpur. Today several poor families of Kanpur have been given their own houses. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, so far approximately 1.5 crore houses have been constructed across the country. In comparison to this, the previous government could construct only 25 lakh houses in the same time while this government has constructed 1.5 crore houses. Even in U.P, after Yogi ji's government came to power, the construction of the houses is going on at a rapid pace. Otherwise, previously, we had been writing letters to the government of UP. Time and again the central government was writing letters but the people governing U.P at that time were not concerned about the poor.

Friends,

On this occasion, as I am handing over the houses to these families, from Kanpur, I wish to reiterate my promise to those poor families who have still not received their houses. After forming the government in 2014, we had said that by 2022 when India will be celebrating 75 years of Independence, there would not be any family without a pucca house in India. Today, with a great sense of responsibility, I would like to tell my poor brothers and sisters that by working at a fast pace, we have constructed 1.5 crore houses compared to their 25 lakh houses. Houses are still being constructed. Houses will also be constructed in the future. Those who haven't got their houses will receive it tomorrow, those who wouldn't receive tomorrow will get 15 days later or after a month but before 2022. Have faith that till Modi is there, it is possible. Everyone will receive their houses. Those governments who used to provide only lip-service are gone. Now the government that believes in action and work is present before you. 

Friends,

Today, as I am here on the soil of Kanpur, it is pertinent to commemorate those brave-hearts whose sacrifices have made the country secure; and the nation is moving on the path of development. From the soil of Kanpur, once again I salute our Shyam Babu who was martyred in the Pulwama terror attack and brother Deepak Pandey who was martyred in the Badgam helicopter crash.

I will say 'Shahido' and you all will say loudly -' Amar rahe!' 'Amar Rahe!'

'Shahido! Amar Rahe! Amar Rahe!'

'Shahido! Amar Rahe! Amar Rahe!'

'Shahido! Amar Rahe! Amar Rahe!'

Friends,

Do you remember what happened after the Pulwama Terror attack? You all were filled with pride with the valour shown by our brave soldiers. Didn't you feel that India too has the power? Our armed forces are capable of doing what they intend to do. Are you all happy? Has your morale been boosted? Are you zealous? But brothers and sisters it is unfortunate that within our country, there are people who are trying to demean the valour of our armed forces. Shouldn't these people be ashamed of themselves? But they are not! Should we forgive those Indians who talk in a language and tone that makes Pakistan happy? Can we? Isn't that an insult to the army? Isn't that an insult to the valour of our soldiers? 

Brothers and sisters,

There are a few people who are deliberately doing this. I am putting serious allegations against them from the soil of Kanpur, from Kanpur which played a crucial role during the freedom struggle. The kind of rhetoric these people are using to gain political brownie points, the kind of language that they are using and filthy allegations that they are raising against the government, are giving more power to the nation's enemies. The terrorists are taking advantage of the rhetoric used by the political opponents against Modi for political interests. Friends! Elections will come and go but it is the responsibility of every Indian to see that the enemies of the nation don't take advantage of it. Isn't it? Isn't that the responsibility of every party and every political leader? 

Brothers and sisters,

Today when the international community is creating pressure on Pakistan, and Pakistan has been caught red-handed in terms of promoting terrorism, and has lost face, in such a scenario, such rhetoric by our people are benefitting Pakistan. Is it right for them to do such a thing? Don't forget, Pakistan is using their statements and spreading that in the world and is misleading the world. And these people are committing this sin.

I want to tell the countrymen from the soil of Kanpur that you might have seen how our government has been taking decisions one after another against the terrorists across the border. As a result, the terrorists are staring at their end. Consequently their nervousness is increasing. As a result of this nervousness, once again yesterday they had made a heinous attempt to launch a terror attack in Jammu. Due to the strict action being taken against the terrorists, their accomplices and sympathizers are becoming panicky! In such a situation my countrymen, as an Indian, we all should remain alert and fulfil our responsibility towards the nation more than ever before. 

Friends,

It is pertinent to maintain the unity of the country. You tell me, whether we should win the fight against terrorism or not? Whether should we eradicate terrorism from its root or not? Who can end this? Who can eradicate terrorism? 

Brothers and sisters,

Not Modi, but the 125 crore Indians can do that! Therefore, we need an environment of unity, brotherhood, goodwill within the country. Modi will be able to take decisions only with that strength and will crush terrorism. Modi's greatest strength is unity of the country, prevailing brotherhood and goodwill. And I need your support for that. Will I get your support? We have to win this fight. And have faith that India will win. Today I congratulate Yogi ji's government. Yesterday in Lucknow, a few insane people had shown inappropriate behaviour against our Kashmiri brothers. The U.P government is investigating the issue and I congratulate Yogi ji's government for that. 

I would urge the other states too to take strict action against those engaged in similar activities. We have to end terrorism. We have to eradicate terrorism from its root and move ahead with the mantra of unity. 

Friends,

In order to perpetuate corruption and dynastic politics, a few people are playing the politics of 'Mahamilavat' alliance. They think of brave soldiers, poor, middle class, farmers, industries and Ganga only when they start looking out for votes. These people who are engaged in the game of 'Mahamilavat' alliance are not able to tolerate Modi who is fighting a decisive battle against terrorism, corruption and poverty. What is their problem? With whom are these 'Mahamilavat' kinds of people having issues? So they say - come, let's have a 'Mahamilavat' alliance, let's take in those who are behind the bars, those who are bound to go into prisons and those who are out on bail. Therefore, they say - let's have 'Mahamilavat', and put an end to Modi regime. While I say - come, let us together put an end to terrorism. But they say - let us put an end to Modi. We say - let's put an end to terrorism.

Friends,

I know that every person of the country including that of U.P is standing with the nation's unity and development. Once again I congratulate you all for the various development projects. I am grateful to you that you have gathered here in such great numbers to shower your blessings! I can see a wave of people wherever my eyes can reach. Say aloud with me - 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

                Victory to Baba Vishwanath, Mother Annapurna and Mother Ganga!  Har Har Mahadev!

 

I am fortunate that today the age-old dreams of Kashi Vishwanath Dham have been fulfilled. When I was not into politics, I had visited this place a number of times. At that time I used to feel that something must be done for this place. Probably Bhole Baba had decided the fate for me – ‘My Son, you talk a lot. Come and put your words into action'. You may call it Bhole Baba's direction or blessing that this is the beginning of that dream's realization. This Kashi Vishwanath Dham in a way is the occasion of Bhole Baba's liberation. Our Lord was closeted within the four walls. I am not sure for how long He was trapped and had tough time breathing. Now, for the first time, several adjoining buildings were acquired. Not only will Bhole Baba be liberated but the devotees too will have a great experience. 

I had been the Chief Minister for several years and had seen several government officials. When the government entrusts any task, the officials put all their efforts to accomplish it. But today I am really proud to say that the team of government employees that Yogi ji has engaged, is sincerely doing the work with complete dedication and devotion day in and day out. It was an arduous task to acquire property, to explain it to everyone, working together with everyone and preventing the opponents from spreading lies and also taking care of the fact that this project doesn't get trapped into a political quagmire. This entire job has been done by this team of officers. I congratulate and thank them for this commendable job today!

 

We had requested the owners of the properties in this area if they could give up this place for the Lord's work.  Almost 300 properties were acquired. Despite opposition from a few people, their cooperation with the government and their faith in the government by giving up their invaluable premises and submitting to the feet of Lord is the greatest sacrifice. Those people have made the greatest donation and as a Parliamentarian representing this region, I am extremely grateful to them. I congratulate them and thank them for cooperating with the government's work as their own work and helping to fulfil this dream.

 

This place had been a target of the enemies for several centuries. It had been demolished multiple times and was non-existent but the faith and devotion of the people of this place have revived and reincarnated it and have given a new birth. This has been going on for centuries. When Mahatma Gandhi had visited this place, even he was pained to see Bhole Baba's place in a poor condition. He could not stop himself from expressing this pain during his speech at BHU. After some days, that incident will be completing 100 years.

 

About 250 years back, Ahilya Devi had initiated its reconstruction. Only then this place had got a proper shape. Ahilya Devi had played a major role. Even at Somnath, Ahilya Devi had played a crucial role. Absorbed in the devotion of Shiva, Ahilya Devi used to engage in this work apart from managing the state. It has been about 250 years. Did anyone ever give a thought to Bhole Baba during these years? No! Everyone thought of self-interest. While demolishing the buildings, we came to realize that more than 40 temples were trapped within these houses; some had been converted to kitchens and what not! It was only for Bhole Baba to ignite that consciousness within us that this dream could be fulfilled now. Not just Bhole Baba but more than 40 such temples of historic and archaeological importance were discovered. When people from within India and around the world will visit this Dham, they will be enthralled by this work of a few people! The governance system was silent for the past 70 years. They kept on suppressing these things. However, today even these 40 temples will be liberated. And I was told that after several decades Shivaratri was celebrated at such a grand scale here. It was an open and spacious complex and had a huge gathering of devotees. Thousands of people were taking selfies here. Check out your social media accounts. You will see lakhs of photographs of this complex. It was a dream. You can see the model and the film. Now Mother Ganga has been directly associated with Lord Shiva. Now we can directly submit ourselves to the feet of Lord Shiva after taking bath in Mother Ganga.

 

This place of Kashi Vishwanath Mahadev, Bhole Baba, is a devotional place for crores of people. People come to Kashi and the root cause is the tremendous respect that they have for Kashi Vishwanath Mahadev. That faith will be further strengthened now. A model will be prepared to protect our temples and to have a proper system in place. The construction of this complex has clearly exhibited how modernity could be brought in by preserving the archeological artifacts and keeping their souls intact. This Kashi Vishwanath Dham will be known as the outer complex of Kashi Vishwanath temple and will take us to the Ganga. This Dham will connect us with Mother Ganges. This will create a new identity of Kashi in the whole world. After about 250 years, probably the Lord had written down this work in my destiny. And therefore, when we got elected in 2014, a voice from within had told me - 'I have not come here on my own, I have been called!' And today it seems to me that the call was for such a work; and the resolution for such work has become more strong and accentuated. This is not just related to the people of Kashi but also to the people of the entire nation. I would like to request Banaras Hindu University to conduct a case study on the entire concept of reconstruction of Kashi Vishwanath Dham; its processes and procedures; the way property was acquired; the way people had cooperated and so on. Let the Dham be built on one hand while this research work can go on simultaneously so that once the work is completed, we have a volume to present before the world about the kind of complex that we have developed, the procedures and the people involved in it. It can create a wonderful documentation. We have followed everything according to the scriptures. No compromise has been made in this regard. We have done this work abiding by the scriptures so that there is no negative impact on devotion in any way. 

 

Today this Kashi Vishwanath Dham is going to be the center of a new consciousness of Composite Kashi and of social consciousness. When this belief becomes the center of social consciousness, then it creates an opportunity for social revolution. Such an auspicious work is being done here today. I once again congratulate Yogi ji's government. Had I received the cooperation of the state government in the first three years, then probably we could have inaugurated this today. But during the first three years, I had no cooperation from the then state government, so I could not do it. But since the time you elected Yogi ji's government, every work in Kashi has been facilitated and we have got the opportunity to complete all the work. I am convinced that we will fulfil the aspirations of the people of Kashi and similarly will take care of these 40 temples that have been excavated. We will work to enhance its magnificence. After the excavation of these archaeological artifacts, BHU can conduct study and find out how old they are, how many decades or centuries old? When were these constructed and so on! Then both the soul of Kashi and these systems will go hand-in-hand. Once again I bow down to the Mother's feet and the Lord's feet. With the blessings of the people of Kashi, this auspicious work is about to begin.

Say along with me –

 

Har Har Mahadev!!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today offered prayers, at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi. He addressed the gathering at Kashi Vishwanath Temple, after a symbolic ground-breaking ceremony. He said that he is indeed blessed, to be associated with the project of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. He complimented the officers involved with the project, for performing their task with devotion. He thanked all the people who had property around the temple, and have allowed its acquisition for the project.

He said the Kashi Vishwanath Temple has survived the vicissitudes of centuries. He recalled and praised Queen Ahiyabai Holkar for her work on the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, over two centuries ago.

He said that since then, not much thought had been given by those in power, to the entire area around the Temple.

He said about 40 Temples near the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, had been encroached over time, and have now been freed of that encroachment. He said the entire Temple complex is now in the process of rejuvenation, and the results are becoming visible. He said a direct link is being established between the River Ganga, and Kashi Vishwanath Temple.

He said this project will become a model for similar projects elsewhere, and would give a new global identity to Kashi.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today released the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle, at an event in Lok Kalyan Marg, New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, he said this five-volume dictionary contains an account of the martyrs from India’s First War of Independence in 1857, to India’s Independence in 1947.

He said that this includes the martyrs of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the non-cooperation movement, the Quit India Movement, and those soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauj, who attained martyrdom, among many others. He said that this was the first attempt at compiling the names of martyrs on this scale. He appreciated all those involved with the compilation, and the effort behind it.

The Prime Minister asserted that a nation that does not honour and remember those who created, or are an important part, of its history, often does not have a secure future. In that sense, he added that this effort, is not just a way to cherish the past, but is also a way to secure the future. He said that youth should especially be made aware of this effort.

The Prime Minister said that the effort of the Union Government is to nurture and recall the brave deeds of the heroes of our freedom struggle. He said this has a positive influence on the future generations, and inspires them to think of “India First.”

The Prime Minister said that India, so far, did not have a war memorial since independence. He said that recently, he dedicated the National War Memorial, or Rashtriya Samar Smaarak, to the nation. Similarly, he said the National Police Memorial has also been built. He also mentioned the world’s tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He said that in memory of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Azad Hind Fauj, the Kranti Mandir has been established at Red Fort. He said museums are also being built to commemorate the brave deeds of the Adivasi heroes who were part of our freedom struggle.

The Union Minister of State for Culture (I/C) Dr. Mahesh Sharma was present on the occasion.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, flagged off the Nagpur Metro, through video conference from New Delhi. The 13.5 km long, Khapri- Sitabuldi section of the Nagpur Metro was inaugurated through the digital unveiling of plaque.

Addressing the gathering through video conference, Prime Minister congratulated the people of Nagpur for the second metro service in Maharashtra. He said that is a special moment for him as he had laid the foundation stone for the Nagpur Metro in 2014. The Metro will provide a better, cost friendly and environment friendly means of transportation for the people in Nagpur, PM added.

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government and State Government are working continuously for the development of Nagpur, keeping its future requirements in mind. He added that Nagpur metro will create employment opportunities for the youth and will also help in the further growth of the city.

Highlighting the initiatives of the Union Government in building modern transport system throughout the country, Prime Minister said that 400 km of operational network of metro have been built in the past four and half years. He added that work is progressing on 800 km of metro network throughout the country.

The Prime Minister mentioned about the benefits of the recently launched common mobility card, the One Nation-One Card. He said that the indigenously developed card, merges debit card with mobility card and has removed India’s dependence on other countries for building such a card. Only very few countries in the world have such a common mobility card for transportation, PM added.

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has an integrated approach towards finding solutions. He reiterated the government’s commitment towards ensuring Ease of Living for all the citizens of the country.

                I am happy to be part of this new beginning for Smart Governance in the North East. The launch of Integrated Command and Control Centres in Gangtok, Namchi, Pasighat, Itanagar and Agartala is a welcome step.

The urban centres of the North East, with their pool of skilled human resource, have the potential to emerge as growth hubs for the entire region.

The Smart City Mission enables cities to identify their potential and challenges. It catalyses smart solutions for the challenges, through public consultation.

Smart City Command and Control Centres use digital technology to integrate different service networks. They enable real-time collaboration among departments such as Police, Transport, Power, Water, Sanitation, and Public Safety utilities.

I believe that with the system in place, administrators will be able to monitor city operations better and respond in real time. 

The implementation of Integrated Command and Control Centres is gathering pace across India. As on the First of March 2019, these Centres have already become functional in fifteen Smart Cities. Work is in progress at fifty other Centres.

I am told that the North-East will have its first completed Smart Command and Control Centre as early as October 2019.

One of the key components of the system is the CCTV Surveillance system for Citizen Safety. This system is designed to help tackle crime.

The Intelligent Traffic Management System will help ease traffic flow.

The Solid Waste Management component in the Command and Control Centre will boost cleanliness in these cities. Smart Street Lighting will make our streets safer and citizen friendly. It will also improve energy efficiency through the conversion to LED systems.

Smart cities are also installing Public-Address Systems and Variable Message Signs to communicate important civic information.

Digital access is an important component of Digital India Mission. Public Wi-Fi system will provide free internet access to Citizens.

The North-East is an environmentally sensitive region. The Environmental Monitoring System and Disaster Management modules will give real time information to Citizens and Government. It will help improve the overall quality of life of Citizens.

As cities start implementing and expanding the different elements of this system, they will be able to improve Ease of Living for their citizens.

I am told that there are over 500 projects with a total worth of nearly 15,000 crore rupees in the ten Smart Cities in the North East. Work orders have already been issued for 59 of these projects.

I am happy to see Namchi in Sikkim, begin work on its Integrated Water Supply projects, LED Street lights and footpaths. Water is becoming a huge challenge in our hill cities. Gangtok has started work on rain water harvesting. It has also undertaken projects to construct multi-level car parks with Smart Parking features to ease traffic congestion.

Agartala has its own unique challenges due to its saucer-shaped geography that makes it vulnerable to floods. The city administration has taken up projects to manage the same under the Smart Cities Mission.

Itanagar has plans to improve its city road network through its Smart Roads and Intelligent Traffic and Transport Management system. Pasighat is addressing the challenges of housing, energy management and business development through key Smart City projects.

So, each city has identified its key problems and is moving towards finding solutions to these problems.

I am happy to note that the other five North Eastern cities of Guwahati, Aizawl Kohima, Imphal and Shillong are also moving in this direction.

Project implementation under the Smart Cities Mission is now gathering pace.

I am confident that we are fast progressing towards urban transformation of our North Eastern cities. This will improve quality of life and boost economic development of the region.

The Union Government had decided to celebrate 7th March 2019 as ‘Jan Aushadhi Diwas’ across India, for  creating awareness and providing impetus onthe use of generic medicines.

Interacting with beneficiaries and store owners from over 5000 locations, the Prime Minister said that in order to ensure the availability of high quality medicines at lower prices, Government had taken two major steps. First, the cost of 850 essential medicines were regulated and the prices of heart stent and equipment for knee surgery were reduced. Second, a series of Jan Aushadi Kendras were started throughout the country. These steps have greatly benefitted not only the poor, but also the middle class, PM said.

The Prime Minister said that medicines are available at fifty to ninety percent lower price than the market rates at Jan Aushadi Kendras. He added that more than five thousand Jan Aushadi Kendras have been opened in the past four and half years. The Kendras provide not only good quality medicines but also provide self-employment and create new employment opportunities, PM said.

Speaking about the vision of holistic transformation of health sector, Prime Minister said that the approach of the Government is ‘No Silos- Only Solutions’. All the stake holders related to health sector are working together to transform the sector, PM said. He said that in the past four and half years, 15 new AIIMs have been either built or are being built and 31,000 MBBS and post-graduation seats in medical sector have been increased.

Interacting with the Prime Minister, the beneficiaries expressed happiness with the good quality of medicines available at Jan Aushadi Kendras. The beneficiaries mentioned that the low cost of the medicines have enabled them to save money while getting proper medication.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, launched the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) Yojana at Vastral in Gujarat. He also distributed the PM-SYM pension cards to select beneficiaries. Over two crore workers at three lakh Common Service Centers across the country witnessed the launch event through video conference

Terming it as a historic day, the Prime Minister dedicated PM-SYM Yojana to the forty two crore strong unorganized sector workers in the country. He said that the scheme will assure a monthly pension of Rs.3000 for the enrolled unorganized sector workers during their old age. It is for the first time since independence that such a scheme is envisaged for the crores of workers engaged in the informal sector, PM added.

The Prime Minister explained in detail about the benefits of PM-SYM. A contribution of equal amount as that of the beneficiary will be made by the Union Government, PM said. He appealed to the informal sector workers earning less than Rs.15000 per month to enroll as beneficiaries in the nearby Common Service Centre.

Assuring that there would not be any hassles with the enrollment process, Modi told the gathering that only a form needs to be filled with Aadhar number and bank details.  The cost incurred by the Common Service Centre for enrolling a beneficiary will be borne by the Union Government. “This is the miracle of Digital India”, PM said.

The Prime Minister appealed to citizens to help and enroll in PM-SYM, those working in the unorganized sector, whether it is in one’s house or in the neighborhood. He said that such actions by the affluent class will greatly benefit the poor. He added that respecting dignity of labour will take the nation forward.

The Prime Minister said that the various schemes initiated by the Union Government like Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, PM Awas Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, Saubhagya Yojana, and Swacch Bharat specifically target those working in unorganized sector. He also mentioned about the initiatives taken the government for the empowerment of women and girl children in the country.

The PM-SYM along with the health coverage provided under 'Ayushman Bharat' and life & disability coverage provided under 'Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana' and 'Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, will ensure comprehensive social security coverage for the workers in the unorganized sector at their old age.

Reiterating his strong stance against corruption, PM said that his Government is committed to eliminating middlemen and corruption. He added that the Prime Minister is always on alert.

For our brave nation- mother India victory to thee.

For our victorious nation- mother India victory to thee.

For our brave soldiers-mother India victory to thee.

Thank you all.

My dear brothers and sisters,

I feel like telling you a lot today. Today is a historic day for all of us in terms of Ahmedabad’s development. Sometime back, the first phase of the Ahmedabad metro was inaugurated and the second phase’s foundation stone has been laid. It’s a wholesome project dedicated for the welfare of Gujarat and India. I would like to congratulate you all on the inauguration of these projects that are set to improve the living conditions in Gujarat.

Friends,

Our long awaited dream came true. To come here, I have travelled in Ahmedabad's metro. I have felt the people’s enthusiasm and happiness, while travelling with them. My heart has filled with joy.

Many people were on their terraces to welcome their very own metro, just like they would gather to fly kites during ‘Uttarayan’ (celebration of summer solstice). All along the journey, I could see terraces full of people. The big dream of people of Ahmedabad had turned into a reality.

Friends,

Metro’s phase one had already started and second phase’s foundation stone has been laid. No sooner did the first work finished, than we started work on the second phase. This is the advantage of our government that we don’t retire after our accomplishments; we get ready for the next project at hand. I say this with a singular meaning, Unlike congress (Smiles). This project is worth more than Rs.10000 cr.

It is going to be very beneficial to lakhs of Ahmedabad’s here and would bring about a change in the lifestyle here. Imagine the number of office-going people and school and college going children, entrepreneurs that would be alleviated from their troubles. Much time would be saved, and many traffic related problems would be solved as well. It would also ensure a cleaner environment. And you know our motto- ’if we lay the foundation stone of a project, definitely we will be finishing the project’. This means the foundation stone laid today for the metro, in 3, 4 or 5 years whenever it gets competed, I’ll be present at the inauguration.  All of this is possible because of your blessings.

Friends,

Nothing would tell about our government’s transparency like the example I’m about to state. Till the year 2014, only 250 km long metro network was there, I’m quoting the current operational metro network which is 650 km long. All this happened within a matter of 55 months.

In addition to this, about 800 km metro network lines are being worked upon at the moment. In the coming year’s urban transport will embark on monumental changes.

Friends,

I have started the facility of “Common Mobility Card” a while ago and dedicated it to the country. This will benefit not only Ahmedabad and Gujarat, but the whole country. You will be happy to know the scope of this program. It is through the use of ‘The RuPay card’. It is going to prove useful when you are traveling. Throughout the country people use different means of transport, like metro, bus or local train, and they have to pay at different places like toll gate, parking etc. Usually people have to carry their wallet, and liquid cash, and you know the difficulties faced at places of these sorts. A lot of time is wasted.

To overcome these difficulties we have developed a ‘Automatic Fare collection system. The challenge in implementing this system is that we have to import the technology from abroad. We were not able to create an integrated system because of the involvement of a lot of companies there. Hence, if the card works for a particular city, it wouldn’t work for another. To overcome this government has created a task force, and started working on this at a comprehensive level. Ministries and divisions were engaged in this work. Even banks were involved. Only one task was assigned to them, that is to develop a system where there shouldn’t be a need for multiple cards and the digital transactions go smoothly. 

After several efforts, this dream of ‘One Nation-One card’ is being realized. With this ‘Common Mobility Card’ you can withdraw money and do shopping, and throughout the country you will be able to use it with different means of transport. To put it in simpler terms, your ‘RuPay Card’ is being combined with the ‘Mobility card’.

With this achievement, our dependency on foreign technology has ended. Now it is ”Made in India”. Now India has joined the list of a handful of countries which is going to implement ’One nation- One card’ system in its transport. Every youth will be proud of this technology made in our country. I would like to congratulate you all on this. It’s also a matter of pride for Gujarat that the metro coaches that are made here in Savli, Vadodara, are being exported now.

As you have seen me signaling a green flag to a train, ‘Patan-Bhildi’ railway line is inaugurated. A foundation stone has been laid to build a ‘double- track railway’ for ‘Anand-Godhra’ railway line. I was a small boy when every M.P. used to mention this ‘Patan-Bhildi’ railway line but it’s now a reality. You can imagine the time lapse between now and then.

Friends,

The new generation can’t imagine the condition of Gujarat two decades ago. There were many places where there was scarcity of water. They had to roam from place to place for medical treatments. 24-hour electricity was a dream. The living conditions were so dire that people were forced to migrate. Nobody even cared about the Adivasis. Today, it’s the effort of each and everyone in Gujarat that led to its place in the world today. You together have changed the world’s perspective on Gujarat.

Brothers and sisters,

We are working for the all-round development of Gujarat at the state level and central level. In the past 55 months, keeping in view the necessities of all of Gujarat, from Umargaon to Ambaji, i.e., the eastern border, and the coastal line, and from Abu till Dahanu, from Rajasthan to Maharashtra, developmental work has been done in a well-planned structure.

The Adivasis in the eastern part and the fishermen families in the west and the line of Ahmedabad-Vadodara-Palanpur-Vapi-Tapi. If we consider Umargaon-Ambaji line, we focused on development of Adivasis. ‘All-weather-connectivity’ is established in all villages. And Rs.2800 crore worth water supply program is being built at the moment.

The water supply scheme of Dahod-Chota Udaipur using Narmada water, the ‘Pey jal Pariyojana’ (Drinking water scheme) for Narmada-Tapi district, water-supply scheme of Mahisagar from Kadana dam, the regional water-supply scheme of Sankheda-Pavijetpur, will satisfy the needs of lakhs of people in Umargaon-ambaji belt. The Dairy employment opportunities are being focused on. In Saberkantha, modern agricultural techniques are being developed under a partnership with Israel. 

Friends,

With the efforts of the government, we were able to screen the ‘sickle cell anemia’ in the Adivasi people. With this help they will be able to face the challenges in a better way. Adivasi children’s education is being focused upon. You will be shocked to know that there is not even one class XII science school in any Adivasi area or tehsil. Now a medical college is under construction, and many universities are being constructed there. Gujarat is a case-study when it comes to showing how, with sheer willpower, great things can be achieved.

With the help of ‘Van bandhu Kalyan Yojana’, we were able to develop many models of schooling, like residential schools, Ashram schools, Eklavya schools. More than 1100 hostels were built, which became helpful for over 2 lakh Adivasi children. In Narmada district, Birasa Munda Tribal University is built which is worth Rs 300 cr. There are special coaching classes for Adivasi students. The reserved medical seats for Adivasi students used to be empty, but now they are full.

The medical college built in Dahod-Palanpur, had also developed medical facilities in that area. Dahod railway workshop is being expanded now. You would have seen in TV that our Jasvantji Bhabor was in the railway yard, and I was inaugurating it with the help of a remote control. There is a place called Parel in Dahod, where the facility of railways used to be empty and dysfunctional. I used to work in those jungles about 30-40 years ago.

We have made it functional again, and the ability of it’s workshop has been increased 4 times, so that employment opportunities will increase. Till now only 450 goods-train wagons were able to overhaul in a year. It has been increased to 1800. You can imagine the increase in employment opportunity here.

Government is also focusing on tourism sector. In Kevadia, ‘Statue of Unity’ was built, which is the tallest statue in the world. It’s double the height of ‘statue of Liberty ’. You know how people throughout the country were enthusiastic about visiting it. Many developmental works are underway in Ambaji. In Rajpipla a ‘Tribal museum’ is being worked on at the moment.

Brothers and sisters, 

The Adivasis, who have made sacrifices during our freedom struggle were not given their due respect and recognition. The Tribal museum aims at showcasing the involvement of Adivasis in our freedom struggle.

Friends,

The ‘Maritime power’ of Gujarat is well known. From Umargaon till Kutch, a vast coast line, the biggest in our country, belongs to Gujarat.

Many projects are underway to develop this. The Ghogha-Dahej Ro Ro Ferry Service has made it easier for the passengers to travel and also save money and time.

With the help of SAUNI(Saurastra Narmada Avataran Irrigation) yojana, many irrigation and drinking-water projects have solved the water problem there. Government is also working on projects to bring clean water out of sea water. In many areas including Jodia distillation works are underway. To increase the connectivity of the coastal belt, using the ‘Sagarmala Yojana’, projects worth more than Rs.75000 cr are underway just in Gujarat. In Dwaraka, Government had established a marine police academy.

Brothers and sisters, 

Along with progress in the 21st century, we are also taking steps to cherish our heritage. I was extremely fortunate to have got the chance to open the memorial of Gandhiji’s ‘Satyagraha’ in Dandi, a few weeks ago. Today, a foundation stone has been laid for something really special and important, which will attract the attention of the world towards us.

It’s the 500 year old port here in Lothal. It’s the oldest port in the world. No other place on earth is as unique as this.

Now, that I have the chance to do something, being a part of the government , a ‘National maritime heritage complex’ foundation stone has been laid at Lothal. A historical museum is being constructed showcasing India’s maritime power, and our 5000 year old relation with the sea-life. This will kick-start global tourism here in Lothal , and there will be a lot of employment opportunities.

Friends,

Lothal has been a beacon of our maritime prowess. It used to draw students from different nationalities, from the ancient university of ‘Valabhi’ situated near it, to study the ways in which a port works, and how business is conducted there. Legend has it that, there was a time when numerous flags of different nationalities used to wave here. National maritime heritage complex will once again recreate that. I have laid its foundation stone today and with your blessings I’m sure that I’ll be the one inaugurating it. 

 

There will be museums, theme parks, a research center, hotels and resorts in the ‘National maritime heritage complex ’, to showcase the prosperous maritime heritage of India to the world. This will also create a lot of employment opportunities. This will introduce our rich heritage to India and to the world.

Friends, 

There will be many projects keeping in view the mid-belt of Gujarat, which can be called as the ‘central-Vista’ others being the western coastal belt, and eastern belt. The Mid-belt will have a bullet train connecting Ahmedabad and Mumbai. This will increase the recognition of Gujarat in the World map. Also, it will increase the connectivity of young entrepreneurs here with Mumbai.

Today we have got the metro running here in Ahmedabad, employees from Central Gujarat will be benefiting from this. Sanand is being developed as a ‘Automobile hub’. Dholera is being developed as a ‘World-class commercial hub’. It already has a airport. Another airport in under construction in Rajkot.

Brothers and sisters, 

Keeping in view the water necessities of central Gujarat, Narmada dam is brought under use, and related irrigational projects are focused on. Many projects are underway through ‘Sujalam-suphalam’ scheme. North and Central Gujarat are being benefited through this scheme of Narmada’s waters.

Friends,

Today is special for me because of another important reason as well. Med-city is being expanded and the dream of bringing all the health facilities under one roof is realized today. Four hospitals are opened at once here. A special mother-child care hospital, a cancer hospital, eye and dental hospitals, are ready to serve you.

Friends,

The project of converting the decades old ‘Civil hospital’ to a ‘Med-city’ started in 2008. I’m happy to announce that within a decade the country’s biggest health care facility, Med-city is ready for service. People are astonished at its scale, a campus accommodating 10000 doctors, medical students, Paramedical staff, sport staff, can together treat 10000 patients here in a day.

You can imagine it turning into a small village catering 20000 people. The capacity of beds is now increased to 5500, and will be increased even more. I am sure that the hospitals that are under completion now will be ready soon as well.

 

Friends, people’s health have always been a priority of our government.

This morning a hospital was opened in Jamnagar with a capacity of 700 beds. Be it north or east or west or south, India is experiencing the progress in the health sector. Overall there are 22 AIIMS in the country, few already working and a few are under construction.

Of these, in 15 AIIMS, work has been done only in the past 5 years. It is our goal to bring health facilities even to remote and small places. So we constructed a chain of institutions from wellness centres to medical colleges.

Friends,

There was a time when the poor and lower middle class were left to their fate. There weren’t enough hospitals, and no schemes to support them. Crores of poor people were not able to check-in to hospitals because of lack of money. With ‘Ayushman Bharat’ and PM-JAY scheme, many are being benefited. Some also call it ‘Modi-care’.

I meet those beneficiaries and I get to talk to them. This scheme is indeed a boon to them.

Friends,

This scheme is just more than 5 months old but already 14 lakh poor were benefited by it. Even the poorest of the poor are getting the best treatment. How is this made possible? It is you people who made this possible. You made the right decision in 2014 by voting for a strong government, which is benefiting everyone.

Brothers and sisters,

Our government has brought fundamental changes in our country’s politics. Even when it comes to the biggest and strongest of decisions we won’t back out. Even when it comes to fighting corruption or terrorism, you see where we stand.

If we refresh our memories about what happened in this civil hospital, which gives life, is the silent witness to bomb blasts, which took many lives. Do you remember? Terrorist attacks used to happen at the border. Should it not be the responsibility of the people sitting in the government then, to square this out?

Brothers and sisters, 

My mind was filled with these, and I said publicly after ‘Pulwama’ that,

I’m just as wounded at heart as my countrymen are. If the government then had the power, they would have squared with the terrorists by crossing the border.

26/11 happened in Mumbai, many innocents were killed. In a few days everyone forgot about it. You tell me, whether we should fight terrorism? Shouldn’t it be vanquished from the roots? Who do you think can do this? Honestly? We punish the evil-doers on one hand and respect and honor the honest workers. I can’t forget the scenes of that incident when I come here. I won’t let go of those evil-doers unpunished. It’s unfortunate that a few people don’t get this. These politicians’ words are being discussed in Pakistan’s parliament, newspapers.

Is this in the goodwill of the nation? Do you say things that Pakistan appreciates? Our army did a brave feat. I won’t wait for long in these matters. To square up is my inherent nature. Till when will we let go of our innocent people’s lives. You tell me friends, Do you believe in our army?, in their words? Should I believe in them or not? There were a few ones who did not pay heed to our army’s words.

One shouldn’t pointing out at our Army. They put their lives at stake and fought for us and won. Why do some people lose their sleep over it? Just for instance, let’s say our army failed, who would the opposition blame? Now that our army won, they are politicizing this. Shouldn’t we respect our soldiers?. A few people are not able to tolerate this.

A few people say that this is all a political drama for elections. When we did surgical strikes, there were no elections. It is our motto to square even with terrorism. No country should be helpless. For 40 years terrorism kept on striking India. Innocents used to die in bomb blasts. Ones who are inclined to Vote-Bank politics, did not take a step to counter this. I am not after politics and positions. For me my country men and their safety are important. We shouldn’t politicize on everything. If you want to bring up a controversy, take my schemes or projects. Our army shouldn’t be a topic of controversy.

If they want they can point me out on my work, I don’t have a problem. But, our military forces shouldn’t be a topic of controversy. Brothers and sisters, I reiterate, I have come to the same place where I have seen dead bodies, wounded doctors and blood soaked nurses. I’m calling out on this with action.

Friends,

Our government is bound to this policy of protecting its people and keeping their necessities as a priority. If you see, in this interim budget plans, we have taken some great changes for the middle class. We have increased the taxable income bracket to 5 lakhs. Three crore people got profited by this.

Friends, 

In the past 5 years, we have laid the foundation towards a modern India. We have created a work culture, in which everyone works with honesty and loyalty and towards the greater good of our country. Now, in the next five years we are going to build an eminent and strong India, on these very foundations. We will all continue work in this direction. I would like to heartily congratulate you all again on the completion of the projects and facilities. I am honored by the love you have shown towards me. Please repeat after me,

Mother India, Victory to thee.

Mother India, Victory to thee.

Mother India, Victory to thee.

Salutations to my motherland.

Salutations to my motherland.

Salutations to my motherland.

Thank you so much!

Mother India! Victory to thee! 

Mother India! Victory to thee! 

 

All the respected people who are present here today in large numbers!

I am fortunate that I have been invited to be present amidst you all on this auspicious occasion and have been able to seek your blessings. 

It is a tough task for the people around the world to fathom our culture, religion and tradition. This is because we do not have one religious book or one god or a single worship system. We are diverse and therefore, it is difficult for them to figure out what we are! That is our specialty. We are such people where different devotees worship different gods and goddesses. If the devotee is a wrestler then he worships Hanuman; if the devotee wants education, he worships Goddess Saraswati; if the devotee deals with wealth, he has Goddess Laxmi. This is our characteristic. In this society, the community that has been providing food grains is the farmer community, the Leuva Patel Samaj in Kathiawad.  And they worship goddess Annapurna. 

'Like devotee like God' has been our special characteristic. Therefore, as a part of this feature a pilgrimage place for goddess Annapurna has been dedicated today. But we can be happy about one special feature of our country. If you just consider Gujarat, and start moving in any direction for 20, 25 or 30 km, you will find a place to sit and have a meal. There will be such arrangements. If you go 20-30 km in any direction, you will find some or the other temple, math or a saint or a sage. In every corner of India, there is a tradition of not letting go a guest empty stomach. So, arrangements are made for their stay and food. It is an age-old tradition. Those who have done 'Narmada Parikrama' know that. The villages at the bank of Narmada are the same. The people are the same. The people visiting the place are new. There are people residing at the banks of river Narmada. The people who take part in ‘Narmada Parikrama' do not have to go hungry. The people of that village serve the guests or the visitors. This is the specialty of our country. This is the tradition. Our society is a philanthropic society and because of this, the spirit of service is inherent in the root of a cultural consciousness.

Here, it is said – Serving people is akin to serving god! The construction of the Maa Annapurna Dhaam as well the hostel facility for imparting education and values to the future generations are a reflection of this core spirit. We want to provide better hostel facilities and other facilities to the children from the backward families so that they get better opportunities to progress. So you all have dove-tailed the tradition of education with our cultural heritage. I congratulate Narhari Bhai and his entire team and those who have donated for this cause.

There is a tradition in our country wherein everything is expected out of the government and when something is not done, questions are raised to which the government is answerable. This system never existed before. There was no such tradition. Dharamshalas and Gaushalas used to be built; places for drinking water were built. The Adalaj Vav or step-well was also built. All these projects were not done by the government. These things are carried out by the society. Dharamshalas, drinking water dispensers and libraries are built by the society. 

Gradually the power of the society was suppressed and the power of the government was made paramount. We want that the state should perform its work while the society will grow more powerful. Stronger the society, stronger will be the nation. The governments are not required to muster power. We encourage and duly promote all such trends from that original tradition. And there is no manipulation in it. It is not the state religion; it is the real power of the society. That is the effort to strengthen that fundamental power. There is no political shrewdness in it. This is the core strength of the society. This is an effort to emphasize upon the society's core strength. 

Today, on the occasion of Consecration ceremony of Mother Annapurna at Annapurna Dhaam, we can think of a new direction for the society. Prasad is distributed in every temple but we can modify the tradition of distributing Prasad in Annapurna Dhaam to suit the present time. As this society connects with Mother Earth, therefore, I request the management to give a small plant each to the devotees as Prasad. And the devotees should be asked to grow the plant in their homes. Throughout the life Mother Annapurna's Prasad will be there in their courtyard or in a corner of their fields. They will always protect this Prasad of Mother Annapurna. 

In this manner, the environment will be protected or not? Thus, many roles will be played by the plant – as a Prasad, as service to humanity and lifting the life. We can do another thing. In Leuva Patel Samaj, whenever a daughter is born, the daughter should be taken to Mother Annapurna's Dhaam to seek Mother Annapurna's blessings. They should be given 5 plants. And those plants should produce timber. If possible, after discussing with the government, this Trust should ask for 100-200 acres of fallow land and that family can sow those 5 plants for timber. When that daughter becomes 20 year old, the timber produced from those plants can be sold in the market. The amount received from the sale of the timber will be given to the daughter. The daughter can merrily get married with the help of that money. Will her parents have to take loan? The government will be providing land so that the families can sow the plants. You make the arrangements and the entire land will turn into greenery. 

Today we have to import timber worth thousands of crores of rupees from abroad. Let the daughters grow up along with the timber plants. The import of timber can be stopped. We can relate religious traditions to economic system in a modern way. I feel this place can work in this manner. I feel giving a casteist colour to everything is a sin. If someone tries to paint Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel in the colour of caste, then it is wrong. He was such a great leader of our nation! The world looks up to the Statue of Unity. Whenever the world will talk about the world's tallest statue, they will have to mention Sardar Patel. And I feel, nobody can break this record in the near future. 

I want to tell another thing. Who was behind the birth of Amul Dairy? Who had started it? I have said before that it is a sin to give casteist colours to anything. But Leuva Patel community understood all these things. Amul Dairy had started and in the beginning the people who pioneered it were from Leuva Patel community. Nobody ever thought that Leuva Patel community could be behind the success of Amul Dairy.  Many congratulations to them. But I have mentioned this story for another reason. Just as 5-15 people from a community have established Amul with a far-fetched vision, which is benefitting the animal rearers, and the people of every community, village as well as the entire Gujarat; similarly, those associated with Mother Annapurna can take up the responsibility of working directly for the farmers. I want the people of this Trust to develop a system in terms of Food Processing based on scientific lines, taking inspiration from Annapurna Dhaam so that our farmers can have value addition to their crops, just like Amul was developed getting inspired by Sardar Saheb. 

The famous chillies of Shertha can bring more income if it is brighter in colour and if the chillies are turned into powder. If the powder is contained in attractive packets, it will further increase its value. There is an immense possibility. Value addition through food processing! Whatever is produced by the farmers, they should get the benefits of a food processing unit. This work should go on at a large scale. There should be research. I believe that with the blessings of Mother Annapurna we can develop such a scenario here.

So I hope that the friends from the industrial world will definitely think in this direction - as to how spirituality and religion can be used for the development of society. And I was told that the Annapurna Dhaam was built keeping the five elements (Panch-tatva) at the centre. There is a couplet (doha) in Ramcharitmanas -

छिति जल पावन गगन समीरा।

पंच रचित अति अधम शरीरा।।

That is, our body is made up of the five elements. With this spirit, as efforts are being made to assimilate the essence of these five elements, I believe that keeping in mind the future of the society, we will brighten it with the basic elements.

Narhari Bhai is very confident that by 2020, it will be inaugurated and the foundation stone will be laid for the second one. And if you are confident, I am one and a half times more confident regarding this. And if someone asks to come home, who will refuse? Am I a guest? This is the joy of coming home. What could be the greater fortune than getting to dedicate oneself to Mother Annapurna's feet and fulfilling the nation's food-grain needs? Today I am present among the mighty farmers, among those who turn grains into gold. Both 'Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan' have immense value. The power of the farmers and of the soldiers provides food security as well as border security to the country. And with their power, the country always successfully avails the opportunities of development. Once again I thank you all for giving me the opportunity to be present with you all. I submit myself to the feet of Mother Annapurna and pray for your brighter future. With that, I end my speech.

Thank you!

Jai Jai Maa Umiya!

Jai Jai Maa Umiya!

Today is Shivaratri.

Har Har Mahadev!

Devotees of Maa Umiya who have gathered here in large numbers!

Today, as I have come to Umiyadham, as we are devoted to worship ‘Shakti’, first of all I would urge you to say with me ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ thrice! After that I will start my speech.

Say for mighty India - ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’!

Say for victorious India - Bharat Mata Ki Jai’!

Say for the brave Jawans - Bharat Mata Ki Jai’!


I first express gratitude to all trustees and congratulate them; they have taken up a very important work. There is a section in our country, whose belief is such that all these religious tendencies are pointless. Such people feel that all these feelings are not good for the society and are serving only some people. I pity their ignorance.

Our history of thousands of years is that this country has been made by the sages, the monks, the Acharyas, saints, the godly men, the elders, the teachers, the scientists, the farmers.  Their contributions and this driving force has been our spiritual tradition in the country. This country has a spiritual heritage. Even during the period of slavery, we fought for such a huge battle for twelve hundred years, every time in every corner of India. There was no dearth of people who were prepared to dedicate their lives for preserving the country's identity, the culture of the country and the tradition of the country. What inspired them? It was the spiritual heritage of this country. Our spiritual system guided the social life. 

 

In a way, our spiritual system and tradition formed the centre of our consciousness and through that the social life also witnessed change in the course of time. Over a period of time, we tend to forget certain things and more often than not only certain rituals remain. We tend to miss out the original spirit, yet if we try to trace the root we will be able to see the same spirit. 

 

Some people used to think that a small Kumbh takes place in every three years and a full Kumbh after every 12 years. In fact the spiritual leaders and learned people used to congregate from every corner of India.  They used to sit together and debate and discuss about things going on in India within a certain time frame. They used to review the period of 12 years during full Kumbh to understand what kind of guidance would the society need after 12 years or what changes are required for the society. This roadmap used to come out during Kumbh deliberations.

We have a system of spiritual consciousness here. Earlier while talking about the Kumbh Mela the distinguished newspapers of the world, described only the Naga Babas and Akharas. This time the Kumbh Mela was held in Prayagraj; but the newspapers of the world talked about cleanliness. The cleanliness of the Kumbh Mela drew the attention of the whole world. This inspiration is manifested in the spiritual consciousness.

 

Mahatma Gandhi visited the Haridwar Kumbh Mela hundred years ago. He had expressed a desire to make the Kumbh Mela clean. After hundred years I got the opportunity to do so. What I want to say is, the kind of power and devotion of crores of people of this country that was required to reconstruct the nation after Independence unfortunately could not be utilized due to apathy and disrespect towards spiritual power.  But fortunately now within the spiritual system, the social reformers are coming forward again. If you go to any corner of India and if you look at the freedom struggle, you will find the inspiration even in the Bhakti cult. Whether Swami Vivekananda, Chaitnya Mahaprabhu or Raman Maharshi, the great saints did think about it in every corner of India. It was indeed a spiritual consciousness that gave birth to the Mutiny of 1857. 

Once again we are witnessing the resurrection of spiritual consciousness in this country. I see this consciousness as a spiritual power. I do not see this as the power of any particular race or creed. It is spirituality. This spiritual power works to lay the foundation of reconstruction of the country. And for that I have come to worship at the feet of Maa Umiya.

Now this country cannot be run in isolation with half-hearted efforts. Small efforts will not do. We have to think big. Whether we should do it or not? Whether it is being done or not? If it was not then world’s tallest statue of Sardar Patel would not have been constructed. If we want to make anything big then why should it only be the tallest in India? Why not tallest in the world? Some people cannot digest it. 

Why India should not have the Bullet Train? Why India should not have the best things in the world? And if our brave Jawans show their valour, it is enormous and precise. They show it where it is meant for. India has changed. The ordinary citizens of India have changed. And because of that the country can take a decision and can achieve that. 

Here people will be blessed by Maa Umiya. It is comparatively easy to change the society on the basis of spiritual devotion. Could anybody think that the whole world would try to learn Yoga? Yoga is now flourishing in every corner of the world. Modi has not introduced Yoga. It is the legacy of our sages and saints. Modi only told the world about the path and the world followed that. 

Today when we are sitting at the feet of Maa Umiya, how can we forget Chhagan Bapa? We have to acknowledge that because of Chhagan Bapa’s foresightedness so many people are sitting here today. He had taken up the responsibility of educating the girls. When we were celebrating the centenary of Chhagan Bapa, I had said this great man knew what the right path to take the society forward was. He had chosen the path of education. And today we can see where the Patidars have reached.

But now one Chhagan Bapa will not do. Now we need hundreds of Chhagan Bapa, who will instill new confidence and new consciousness in the society. I believe such a system will develop in Maa Umiya Dham. 

Youngsters like C.K. are working hard. I have known C.K. closely for more than thirty years. He is very active. He works smilingly and with devotion. R.P. is also a very hard-working person. The new team has taken up the work with the blessings of the old team. So I believe that the work will be accomplished before the stipulated time and will be better than the expectation.

We all must move forward. But if we take a wrong path, can it be called moving forward? If we worship Maa Umiya and kill the female foetus in mother’s womb, will Maa Umiya forgive us? Why are you silent? Look, I have grown up amongst you, so I think I have the right to ask you.  I am telling you as the Prime Minister. I used to be very angry with the people of Unjha. Nobody would have admonished Unjha as I have done. Why? In the entire Gujarat, the number of female child was lowest in Unjha Tehsil in comparison to male child. In a place where Maa Umiya is the deity, girl child was being killed!

With Maa Umiya’s blessings I want something from you. Will you give it to me? These people will come to you for donations. One thousand crores will have to be collected. But I do not want a single paisa. I want something else. Will you give it to me? Not like that. Raise both your hands and say that you will give it to me. You are at the feet of Maa Umiya. Raising your hands say in the name of Maa Umiya that “I will not commit the sin of killing the girl child. I will not commit the sin of female foeticide.”  Our doctors will also not resort to this wrong practice to earn money. We will pull together all our resources and try to convince others that there is no difference between a son and a daughter. You can see that today in sports most of the gold medals are won by the girls. If you look at the results of tenth and twelfth, the girls are the most successful ones. Some people are under the illusion that the son will take care of them when they will become old. Forget it. There are instances that despite having four sons and four bungalows, the father is languishing in the old age home. On the other hand, a single daughter takes the vow that she will not marry and will take care of her old parents. Today I want this commitment from this society and I believe that this society will not turn me away. 

With the blessings of Maa Umiya, there has been a transformation in the society. But unfortunately, certain things are ruining our new generation. We have to save our youth. We have to think how we can prevent our youth from taking drugs. Money will come; but every son of Maa Umiya will have to ensure that with money drugs and intoxicating substance should not enter his house.

I am saying this because I know that it is increasingly becoming difficult to save the young ones in the family. This spiritual consciousness can save them. This collective rite can save them. And for that this Umiya Dham should become a centre for social education, social reform and social consciousness. My good wishes to all the trustees. I shall be in the Government of India even after 2019. So do not worry. If the government of India has anything to do, please do not hesitate; because my Delhi home also belongs to you. Lots of thanks!

Say once again – 

Jai Jai Maa Umiya!

Jai Jai Maa Umiya!

Jai Jai Maa Umiya!

Bharat Mata Ki Jai!

भोलेनाथ सबका भला करें।

मेरी बात शुरू करू उससे पहले तीन बार भारत माता की जयकार करनी है। मैं करवाऊंगा।

पराक्रमी भारत के लिए भारत माता की – जय

विजयी भारत के लिए भारत माता की – जय

वीर जवानों के लिए भारत माता की– जय

 

बड़ी तादाद में हमे आशीर्वाद देने के लिए पधारे हुए जामनगर के प्यारे भाईओ और बहनों,

आज शिवरात्रि का पावन पर्व है और गुजरात ऐसी धरती है कि जहाँ दो-दो ज्योतिर्लिंग है। सोमनाथ और नागेश्वर की ये धरती मेरे लिए बहुत ही सुखद अवसर की शिवरात्रि के पावन पर्व पर सोमनाथ और नागेश्वर की धरती पर आने का मुझे मौका मिला है।

जब मैं मुख्यमंत्री था और देश भर के सभी मुख्यमंत्रियों की मीटिंग में जाता था और उनको मैं कहता की भाई आप सब लोगों को लगता है कि गुजरात में क्या समस्या है, सब कुछ अच्छा-अच्छा है, आपको क्या तकलीफ है और जब उनको मैं अपनी बात समझाता था तो उन सब को आश्चर्य होता था। मैं उनसे कहता की भाई हमारा ऐसा राज्य है की जिसके पास कोई खदान या खनिज का भंडार बहुत बड़ा नहीं है। उससे भी बड़ी समस्या यानी पानी। हमारे कई गाँव पीने के पानी के लिए छटपटाते, हमारी सरकार की बहुत बड़ी शक्ति, दस साल में से सात साल सूखे में जाती, पीने का पानी कैसे पहुंचाया जाए उसमे जाती। अगर ईश्वर ने हमें पानी की सुविधा कर दी होती तो हम इतने ज्यादा ताकतवर थे इतने ज्यादा सशक्त थे कि हम पूरे हिंदुस्तान को जहाँ ले कर जाना हो वहाँ ले कर जा पाते, इतनी हमारे अंदर ताकत थी।

हमारा बज़ट, हमारी सरकार की शक्ति ये सारा कुछ हमे पानी के पीछे खर्चना पड़ता था, हिंदुस्तानभर में से आनेवाले मुख्यमंत्रियों को ये बात सच ही नहीं लगती थी, इतनी सारी समस्या है। उन्हें अंदाजा ही नहीं आता था। लेकिन उसके सामने हमारा संकल्प भी था। ठीक है हमारे पास बारह मास बहने वाली नदियों का अभाव है, बारिश कम होती है और गुजरात को विकास के पथ पर आगे बढ़ना है तो रोते - धोते बैठे रहने से कुछ नहीं होगा भाई। पहले पानी नहीं था तो कच्छ खाली होता था, हमने तय किया पानी नहीं है तो हम पानी की समस्या का ही पहले समाधान लाएंगे, पानी पहुँचाएंगे और देश गुजरात को पानीदार बनाएँगे और ये भी हकीकत है की सरदार सरोवर डैम उसमे इतनी सारी रूकावटे आई, इतनी सारी रूकावटे आई और उसके लिए उस समय की सभी सरकारे जिम्मेदार है। वे छुट नहीं सकती है, उन्हें जवाब देना पड़ेगा। अगर आज से चालीस साल पहले नर्मदा का कार्य पूरा हो गया होता तो गुजरात को पानी का पिछले 40 साल तक जो पैसे खर्चने पड़े, वो नहीं खर्चने पड़ते। और आज जब सरदार सरोवर डैम बन गया, पानी आया, तो उसके पहले डैम का कार्य पूरा होने से पहले ये पानी कच्छ और काठियावाड की धरती पर किस तरह पहुंचे उसके लिए भारी जहमत उठाई और एक योजना बनाई और मुझे अच्छी तरह से याद है, ये ‘सौनी’ योजना की कल्पना जब मैंने पहली बार पेश की थी राजकोट में आकर के तब तो ज्यादातर लोग... और वो कुछ लोग जो पुरे गाँव की चौराहट करनेवाले लोग होते है वो तो शुरू ही हो गए थे कि ये मोदी ने चुनाव आया इसलिए ये मुद्दा छोड़ा है, ये चुनाव आया इसलिए मोदी ने ऐसा किया है अरे चुनाव तो हमारे यहाँ कहीं न कहीं चलती ही रहती है भाई, किसी न किसी राज्य में चुनाव चलते ही रहते है भाई। मैं कोई भी कार्य करूँ उसको आप चुनाव के साथ जोड़ ही सकते है। उस वक्त आशंका थी की यह मुमकिन ही नहीं है, हजारो करोड़ो रूपये, पानी की पाइप लगवाना, पानी को बीस बीस फ्लोर, मकान जितना ऊँचा ले कर जाना और वो पानी... ये सारा कुछ मुमकिन ही नहीं लग रहा था। कारण, हमने ज्यादा से ज्यादा वो टेंकर देखे थी, हेंड पंप देखे थे, उससे लम्बा पानी का समाधान कभी सोचा ही नहीं था।

एक तरफ वो मानसिकता, ऐसे लोगों ने राज किया जिनको टेंकर से आगे कुछ दिखा ही नहीं और हम ऐसे लोग आए की जिन्होंने पाइपलाइन से 500-500, 700-700 किलोमीटर और ऐसी पाइपलाइन की जिसमें आप मारुती ले कर जा सकते है और उसी का नतीजा है की आज ‘सौनी’ योजना से पानी पहुंचा। कच्छ की सीमा पर बीएसएफ के जवान, उन्हें नर्मदा का ताजा पानी पीने को मिलता हो, ये कमाल टेक्नोलॉजी, इंजीनियरिंग और इच्छाशक्ति उसकी वजह से संभव हो पाता है। मुझे ख़ुशी है की गुजरात को छोड़ने के बाद भी हमारी टीम उतनी ही लगन से, समयबद्ध हो कर इस सपने को पूरा करने के लिए काम पर लगी हुई है और एक के बाद एक ‘सौनी’ योजना के फेज़ पुरे होते जा रहे है और उसी का परिणाम है कि आने वाले दिनों में, और में हमेशा कहता था की नर्मदा का पानी वो पानी नहीं पारस है। जिस तरह पारस के स्पर्श मात्र से लोहा सोना बन जाता है उसी तरह नर्मदा के स्पर्श से गुजरात की धरती हरियाली बन जाए, सोना उगे, हमारी धरती ऐसी बन जाए। हमारा किसान पसीना तो बहाएगा लेकिन उस पसीने के साथ जब नर्मदा का अभिषेक हो तब ये पसीना प्रज्वलित हो उठता है, उग जाता है और आज ये गुजरात ने कर के दिखाया है।

आज यहाँ मुझे गुरु गोबिंद सिंहजी मेडिकल कॉलेज के लिए भी, उसके विस्तार के लिए, उसकी नई-नई योजना के लोकार्पण का उसका भी अवसर मिला। हम में से सबको याद होना चाहिए, पता होना चाहिए की गुरु परंपरा के अंदर गुजरात का विशेष नाता रहा है। गुरु गोबिंद सिंहजी के जो पहले पंच प्यारे थे। उन पहले पंच प्यारों में एक हमारे द्वारिका का था और दर्जी समाज में से था और उसने गुरु गोबिंद सिंहजी के सामने शीश काट दो, मैं आपका शिष्य बनकर के आया हूँ। द्वारिका से जाकर के दर्जी का बेटा और वो गुरु गोबिंद सिंहजी ने सिख परंपरा के लिए जो काम किया उसमे एक पहले पांच सिपाहीयों में से एक हमारा द्वारिका का था और इसीलिए और उस वक्त द्वारिका जामनगर का हिस्सा था और परिणाम स्वरूप यह अस्पताल उसको गुरु गोबिंद सिंहजी के नाम के साथ जोड़ा गया है।

इतिहास की उस घटना को अमरत्व देने का वो प्रयास इस नाम के साथ जुड़ा हुआ है। और आज ये अस्पताल और आरोग्य के क्षेत्र में एक बड़ी क्रांति का कार्य हमने उठाया है। गुजरात में हो रहा है, देश में हो रहा है। यहाँ से मैं अहमदाबाद जाने वाला हूँ। वहाँ भी चार बड़े अस्पताल के प्रॉजेक्ट है। कारण? अस्पतालों की व्यवस्था के बिना, आधुनिक टेक्नोलॉजी बिना आज की भागदौड़ वाली जिंदगी में आधुनिक इलाज नहीं हो सकता।

पहले जमाना था, सभी लोग इतने स्वस्थ हुआ करते थे की गाँव में बस एक वैद्यराज हुआ करते तो पूरा गाँव स्वस्थ रहता था। अब दुनिया बदल चुकी है। बायीं आँख का डॉक्टर एक होता है तो दायीं आँख का दूसरा होता है। स्पेशियालिटी का जमाना है। हमे भी उसके लिए तैयार होना पड़ता है और आज जो गुजरात के अंदर आधुनिक अस्पताल बन रहे है उसका सीधा लाभ मिलनेवाला है इतना ही नहीं, आयुष्मान भारत योजना हो या माँ योजना हो – मुख्यमंत्री अमृतम योजना। मैं जब यहाँ गुजरात में था तब एक चिरंजीवी योजना शुरू की थी। कई गरीब माताओं की प्रसूति अस्पताल में हो, माताओं की जिंदगी बचे, संतानों की जिंदगी बच जाए और उस में इतनी ज्यादा सफलता मिली थी उसके बाद एक के बाद एक गुजरात के अंदर आरोग्य के क्षेत्र में हम योजनाएं लाए और जब भारत सरकार में गया तो आयुष्मान भारत नाम की योजना आई और आयुष्मान भारत योजना विश्व की सबसे बड़ी योजना है।

आप सबको तो पता है की मुझे छोटा तो पसंद आता ही नहीं है। कुछ भी करना हो तो बड़ा ही करना होता है। हुआ या नहीं हुआ अभी? पाइपलाइन डलवानी है तो 500 किलोमीटर, 900 किलोमीटर, 700 किलोमीटर। रुक-रुक के काम नहीं करना है। और उसी तरह काम कर के आयुष्मान भारत योजना, अमेरिका की जनसंख्या, केनेडा की जनसंख्या, मैक्सिको की जनसंख्या- इन तीनो देशों की जनसंख्या को जोड़ा जाए उससे भी ज्यादा लोगों को भारत में आयुष्मान भारत योजना का लाभ मिलने वाला है।

कोई भी गरीब परिवार पांच लाख रूपयें साल में, परिवार में कोई भी बीमार हो तो पांच लाख रूपयें तक का भुगतान भारत सरकार करेंगी, उसे कभी दीन-हीन नहीं रहना पड़ेगा। इतना ही नहीं, बड़े से बड़ी अस्पताल में वह इलाज करवा सकता है। ऐसा नहीं की वो उस सरकारी अस्पताल में जाए और फिर बेचारा शाम को वापस आए डॉक्टर की राह देख कर के नहीं। उसका भी हक़ है। इस देश में पन्द्रह हजार से भी बड़ा अस्पताल आज हमारे इस काम में सहभागी हुई है।

इतना ही नहीं, हमारा जामनगर का भाई भोपाल गया हो, और मान लीजिए भोपाल में वो बीमार हो गया, तो उसको जामनगर वापस आने की राह देखने की जरूरत नहीं है, वो भोपाल के अस्पताल में जाए और वो कार्ड दिखाए तो बिना पैसे भोपाल में भी सेवा हो। वो कोलकाता गया हो तो वहाँ भी हो और करांची... कोचीन गया हो तो भी हो। अभी जरा मेरे दिमाग में वो सब चीज़े ज्यादा भरी पड़ी हुई है। लेकिन अच्छा है या नहीं है? हाँ वो भी तो करना पड़ता है न भाई।

और इस प्रकार आरोग्य की सेवा सामान्य मानवी को मिले। अब आरोग्य की सेवा मिले सिर्फ ऐसा नहीं, इसकी वजह से जो छोटे-छोटे शहर है वहाँ पर बड़े-बड़े अस्पताल आने की संभावनाएं पैदा हुई है। देश में नए 2 से 3 हजार बड़े अस्पताल आने की संभावना इसकी वजह से पैदा हुई है। एक बड़ा क्षेत्र विकसित होने वाला है और एक अस्पताल बने यानि सैकड़ों लोगों को रोजगार मिलता है। अनेक लोगों को उनको छोटे-छोटे टेक्नीशियन और कितने सारे लोगों की जरूरत पडती है, उसका काम मिलता होता है। देश में आरोग्य के क्षेत्र में एक बहुत बड़ी क्रांति इसकी वजह से आने वाली है और ऐसे अस्पताल के काम के लिए आज यहाँ मुझे आने का अवसर मिला है।

पानी की जब बात करते है तो पानी में एक प्रॉब्लम है। पानी एक ऐसी चीज़ है की जब इन्सान मर्यादा लाँघ देता है और वहीँ पर संकट शुरू होता है। इतनी बड़ी ‘सौनी’ योजना करने के बाद भी हमे ऐसा लगता है की गुजरात की जरूरत को देखते हुए हमारे पास बारिश का पानी या नदियों का पानी पूरा नहीं हो पाएगा और इसीलिए बड़े स्तर पर समुद्र के पानी को मीठा बनाने की अरबो रूपये खर्च कर के योजना बनाने की जरूरत है और उसमे से एक प्रोजेक्ट का आज शिलान्यास हुआ है। समुद्र के पानी को मीठा कर के उसे लोगों तक पहुँचाना।

इसका अर्थ ये हुआ की पानी को परमात्मा का प्रसाद समझकर इस्तेमाल करना पड़ेगा, गुजरात को पानी बर्बाद करने का अधिकार बिलकुल नहीं। इतनी मेहनत करके गरीब को मिलता है, उसे एक रुपया मिलना चाहिए, 80 पैसा दिया 20 पैसा निकाले पानी पहुँचाने के लिए। कारण? पानी नहीं होगा तो जीवन संभव नहीं हो पाएगा, अनेक कार्य... स्‍कूल के कमरे बनवाने हो, लाख कमरे बनवाने हो तो दस हजार कमरे कम बनवाए लेकिन वो पैसे पानी में रखने पड़े। अस्पताल बनवानी हो तो कुछ पैसे अस्पताल में कम किए, पानी के लिए डाले।

गुजरात में सभी क्षेत्र के अंदर से पानी के लिए थोड़ा-थोड़ा निकालना ही पड़ता है। इसका मतलब ये हुआ की पानी सबसे ज्यादा मूल्यवान बन चुका है। ऐसे समय पर गुजरात के प्रत्येक नागरिक जिम्मेदारी है पानी बचाने की। किसान की जिम्मेदारी है ड्रिप इरीगेशन करने की। पानी बचाना वो हमारे लिए अनिवार्य है। बूंद-बूंद पानी का उपयोग करने का एक वातावरण बनाना पड़ेगा और जिस प्रकार देश में स्वच्छता अभियान ने एक बहुत बड़ी सफलता दिलाई, स्वच्छता अभियान जन आंदोलन बन गया और इसबार का कुंभ का मेला गुजरात के जो लोग आते थे, कुंभ के मेले में जाते थे और फिर आते जाते मिले तो स्वच्छता की इतनी तारीफ करते थे इतनी सारी तारीफ करते थे। कुंभ के मेले की स्वच्छता लोगों के छू गई। देश में स्वच्छता एक आंदोलन बन गया।

महात्मा गाँधी सो वर्ष पहले हरिद्वार के कुंभ में गए थे और उस वक्त उन्होंने कुंभ का मेला स्वच्छ होना चाहिए ऐसी इच्छा प्रकट की थी, 100 साल तक नहीं कर पाए, हमने कर के दिखाया और इसलिए जिस तरह स्वच्छता का आन्दोलन सफल हुआ तो गुजरात में पानी बचाओ आंदोलन सफल हो सकता या नहीं हो सकता? क्या हम उस दिशा में आगे बढ़ सकते है? और आज जब प्रभु शिव को नर्मदा का जल अभिषेक कर रहे है तो आज शिवरात्रि के पावन पर्व पर समग्र गुजरात संकल्प करे की हम पानी को भी बचाएंगे। आप देखिए एक बहुत बड़ी क्रांति आएगी।

आज यहाँ रेलवे के भी प्रोजेक्ट्स की योजना बनी है। जिस गति से रेलवे का काम चल रहा है, इलेक्ट्रीफिकेशन का हो, गेज कन्वर्जन का हो, डबल लाइनिंग का काम हो, पहले होता था उससे दुगुनी स्पीड है। अब आप लोगों को कुछ नया नहीं लगेगा क्योंकि आप लोगों ने मुझे देखा है, में यहाँ किस तरह काम करता था, लेकिन देश के लोगों को आश्चर्य होता है कि ऐसा भी हो सकता है क्या? मैं उनको कहता हूँ जाओ गुजरात में देख कर आइए, होता है सब कुछ होता है, करे तब तो न भाई और आज देश में हो रहा है। देश में हो रहा है, रेलवे के काम में गति आई है। आधुनिक रेलवे... आधुनिक रेल, कोच की व्यवस्थाएं, ये सब संभव हो पाया है और डबल स्पीड से, पहले से.. पहले से जो काम होते थे उससे डबल स्पीड हो गई है।

हम प्रधानमंत्री किसान सम्मान निधि की योजना लाए, 5 एकड़ और उससे कम ज़मीन ऐसे किसान को साल में 6 हजार रूपये सीधे उसके बेंक के खाते में पहुँच जाएंगे। हर सीजन से पहले 2 हजार रूपये पहुँच जाएंगे। उसको खाद खरीदना हो, उसे बीज खरीदने हो, दवाई लानी हो, उसे काम में आएँगे और एक ऐसा झूठ चलाया, ऐसा झूठ चलाया पुराने लोगों ने, हर दस साल में एक बार उनको बुखार चढ़ता है, कर्ज माफ़ करने का, चुनाव आए नहीं की कर्ज माफ़ करो, कर्ज माफ़ करो ये भाषण शुरू कर देते है, करना कुछ भी नहीं होता, दस साल तक किसान का जो भी होना हो वो होता रहे, कुछ भी नहीं करना और आपको आश्चर्य होगा की 2008-09 मुख्य चुनाव को ध्यान में रखते हुए उन्होंने ये कर्ज माफ़ी की बात की हुई थी, पुरानी सरकार ने 6 लाख करोड़ रूपये का कर्ज था, देश के किसानों का माफ़ कितना किया? 52 हजार करोड़ और सब के वोट छल के ले गए, सब की आँखों में धूल फेंकी और चुनाव खत्म होने के बाद किसान बेचारा क्या करेगा, उसको लगता है की नियम में मेरा नहीं हुआ था तो नहीं आया। उन लोगों ने ऐसे मुर्ख बनाने के ही कार्यक्रम किए है।

हम ऐसी योजना लाए हैं कि हर साल 75 हजार करोड़ रूपये किसान के खाते में जमा होंगे और दस साल में साड़े सात लाख रूपये किसान के खाते में पहुँच गए होंगे। इसका मतलब ये की गाँव में साढ़े सात लाख करोड़ रूपये इकठ्ठे हुए हो, गाँव में यानी गाँव की पूरी इकोनोमी बदल जाती है भाई। साढ़े सात लाख करोड़ रूपये गाँव में उड़ेले हो यानी गाँव का इन्सान पहले साइकिल न खरीदता हो तो साइकिल ख़रीदे, बच्चों के लिए शूज़ न खरीदता हो तो शूज़ ले कर आए, शूज़ लाता हो और शॅाक्‍स न लाता हो तो शॅाक्‍स भी ले कर आए, घर के अंदर अच्छे बर्तन ले कर आए, घर के अंदर अच्छा खाना बनाने की कोशिश करे, एक तरह से गाँव की पूरी इकोनोमी बदल जाए ऐसा काम हमने किया है और वो लोग जब कर्ज माफ़ी करते थे गाँव में सौ में से मुश्किल से 20-25 किसानों को लाभ मिलता था, हमारी योजना की वजह से सौ में से लगभग 90 किसानों को लाभ मिलने वाला है और हर साल मिलने वाला है।

भाइयों बहनों, समस्याओ के स्थायी समाधान और किसी भी तरह के अपने पराये के बिना सबका साथ सबका विकास इस मंत्र के साथ काम करें उससे कितना सारा लाभ होता रहता है। अभी हमने किसानों को जो लाभ मिलता है वो सारे लाभ पशुपालकों को भी देना का फैसला किया है। किसान क्रेडिट कार्ड पशुपालक को भी मिलेगा। जिस तरह सस्ते दरो पर ब्याज बेंक के पैसे मिलते है, सस्ती ब्याज की दरों पर उसी तरह पशुपालक को भी मिलेगा और वही लाभ मछुआरे को भी दिया। मछुआरों के लिए भी इसकी व्यवस्था की गई, देश में पहली बार जब अटलजी की सरकार बनी थी तब पहली बार आदिवासी लोगों के लिए एक अलग विभाग बना था, आदीवासियों के लिए विभाग नहीं था हमारे देश में। इस देश में मोदी सरकार आने के बाद पहली बार मछुआरों के लिए अलग मंत्रालय बनाया गया है और मछुआरों का, समुद्र तट के समग्र पूरे देश के मछुआरों की समस्याएं, मछुआरों का विकास, मछुआरों के क्षेत्र में आधुनिकता, मत्स्यपालन के क्षेत्र में काम करने वाले लोगों के लिए आधुनिक संसाधन उसका पूरा काम। मछुआरों को भी किसान क्रेडिट जैसी सुविधा, वो बैंक में से कम दरों पर ब्याज पर पैसे ले सके और उसको भी जिस प्रकार किसान को पैसे मिलते है उस प्रकार पैसे मिले उसका काम हमने किया है। स्थायी परिवर्तन कैसे लाया जा सकता है उसकी चिंता की है।

गहरे समुद्र में माछीमारी करने लिए हमारा मछुआरा भाई... आज मछुआरा किनारे-किनारे पर माछीमारी करता है इसलिए उसे कुछ ज्यादा नहीं मिलता, पर अंदर जाए तो कमाई बड़ी हो सकती है, कम महेनत में हो और उसके लिए जिस प्रकार के वेसल्स चाहिए उनको बनाने में उसका सुधार करने के लिए भारत सरकार सब्सिडी देती है 15 लाख रूपये की सब्सिडी जिससे की मेरा मछुआरा गहरे समुद्र में जा कर के बड़ी कमाई कर सके उसके लिए यह काम हमने किया है।

हमारा प्रयास है कि इस देश में हर एक के पास अपना घर हो, हर एक इन्सान को 2022 तक घर मिल जाए। मैंने जैसे कहाँ आपको की मुझे छोटा तो पसंद ही नहीं है, जो भी करना हो वो पूरा करना, बड़ा करना और जल्द ही करना। 2022 तक इस देश में एक भी व्यक्ति ऐसा न रहे, एक भी परिवार ऐसा न हो की जिसको अपनी मालिकी का घर न हो और पक्का घर न हो। भूतकाल में जो सरकार गई न, उसने 25 लाख मकान बनवाए थे, हमने इन 55 महीनों के भीतर 1 करोड़ 30 लाख मकान बना दिए है और इसलिए मैं कहता हूँ कि 2022 तक इस देश के प्रत्येक इन्सान को घर मिलेगा और घर मिले यानी सिर्फ चार दीवारें नहीं, गैस का कनेक्शन, बिजली का कनेक्शन, पानी का कनेक्शन, नजदीक में स्‍कूल, ये सब कुछ, आधा अधूरा कुछ भी नहीं। इस पूरी योजना के साथ काम चल रहा है और उस काम को पूरे करने की दिशा में आज जामनगर के अंदर भी मुझे मकान की चाबियाँ देने का अवसर मिला है और जिनको नहीं मिला है उनको भी मैं कह देता हूँ मोदी सरकार फिर से आने वाली है और 2020 में मेरा सपना है कि हर एक को घर देना है और वो मिलने वाला ही है। सबको मिलने वाला है और इसलिए मेरा आग्रह है हमारे यहाँ जामनगर यानी लघु उद्योगों का एक तरह का बड़ा विशाल फलक, लघु उद्योगों की वजह से जामनगर की आन बान और शान है। इस लघु उद्योग के विकास के लिए भारत सरकार ने अनेक योजना, पहली बार आप ऑनलाइन जा कर के लघु उद्योग के लोग खुद को बैंक लोन चाहिए तो बैंकों के चक्कर काटने की जरूरत नहीं है, सिर्फ आप ऑनलाइन भर दीजिए, 59 मिनिट में, 59 मिनिट में 1 करोड़ रूपये तक की लोन मंजूर होती है, सिर्फ 59 मिनिट में।

किसी का बीच में से खाना वाना सब बंध, बैंकर को चाय पिलाने की जरूरत नहीं पडती, साहब-साहब कहने की जरूरत नहीं, ऑनलाइन करो, 59 मिनिट में, अपने दस्तावेज रखिए, आपको हक़ मिल जाए, इस प्रकार की क्रांति लाने का काम आज इस सरकार ने किया है और उसकी वजह से इज़ ऑफ़ डूइंग बिजनेस, 142वे क्रम से 77 पर आ गया, इतना बड़ा जम्प लगा दिया क्योंकि उसमे जो लाइसेंस आदि की ये सब जो मुसीबतें थी उन सब को दूर कर दिया, जिसका लाभ जामनगर, मोरबी, राजकोट... ये सब छोटे-छोटे कारखाने में बहुत बड़ा एक जबरदस्त वातावरण बना है। ये लघु उद्योगों के लिए इतना बड़ा फायदा इंजीनियरिंग वर्क के अंदर काम करनेवाले लोगों के लिए फायदा, उत्पादन के क्षेत्र में जानेवाले लोगों को फायदा।

जीएसटी के सारे कानूनों में जैसे-जैसे हमे पता लगता गया की यहाँ जरूरत है यहाँ जरूरत है सुधार करते जा रहे है और जीएसटी आज सामान्य मानवी को उपकारक बने उस तरह का बना दिया गया है और उसका लाभ सामान्य मानवी को हो रहा है। एक तरह से सामान्य मानवी भारत सरकार या राज्य सरकार में खुद की बनाई हुई चीज़े बेच नहीं पाता था। छोटा सा काम हो, छोटी-छोटी चीज़े बनाता हो, कोई प्लास्टिक की बाल्टी बनाता हो या कोई टेबल के लिए की कोई चीज़े बनाता हो या छोटी-छोटी कुर्सियां बनाता हो, कुछ भी मेल ही नहीं खाता था। हम एक GeM पोर्टल लाए, GeM पोर्टल के अंदर आप रजिस्टर करवाएं, भारत सरकार में जिस को चाहिए वहाँ लिख ले, भेजने वाला वहाँ लिखे, करोड़ो रुपये का काम सामन्य मानवी आज सरकार में भेजता है, कोई टेंडर नहीं, कोई बिचोलिया नहीं, कोई अपना पराया नहीं, कोई किसी भी प्रकार का भ्रष्टाचार नहीं, और सामान्य मानवी जो चीज़े बनाता है वो आज सरकार के अंदर सीधी खरीदी जा रही है वरना पहले बड़े-बड़े टेंडर वाले आए, फिर छोटा इन्सान उससे बड़े को बेचे, बड़ा उससे बड़े को बेचे, बड़ा उससे बड़े को बेचे और फिर बड़ा इतना बड़ा होता था की जो सरकार को बोले इसलिए फिर सरकार उसे ले लेती थी, सारे पैसे बड़े के पास जाते थे, अब ये सीधे पैसे छोटे के पास जाते है ये काम करने की ताकत आज भारत सरकार में है और हमने कर के दिखाया है। उसका लाभ हम दे रहे है।

भाइयों बहनों, कोई भी देश शक्ति बिना नहीं चल सकता, सामर्थ्य बिना नहीं चल सकता, हमारे गुजरात में अक्सर कौमी दंगे होते थे या नहीं होते थे भाई? हमारे जामनगर में भी क्या था, होते थे या नहीं होते थे? सब बंद हो गया या नहीं हो गया? सब लोग सुख-चैन से जीने लगे या नहीं जीने लगे? सबकी प्रगति होने लगी या नहीं होने लगी? ये सब वैमनस्य करवाने वाले लोग ठिकाने लगे इसलिए सब कुछ अच्छे से चलने लगा या नहीं चलने लगा? अब मुझे बताइए भाई, इस देश में से आतंकवाद की बीमारी जानी चाहिए या नहीं जानी चाहिए? ऐसे नहीं, जरा जोर से बोलिए जामनगरवालों, ये आतंकवाद की बीमारी जानी चाहिए या नहीं जानी चाहिए? आतंकवाद को जड़ से उखाड़ कर फेंकना चाहिए या नहीं फेंकना चाहिए?

अब हम यहाँ पर दवाई करें तो हो सकता है क्या भाई? जहाँ पर हो रहा है वहीँ पर करना पड़ता है की नहीं भाई? आप किसी भी डॉक्टर के पास जाओ तो उसको लगे की भाई आपकी ये बीमारी तो ठीक है लेकिन मुख्य समस्या आपके खून में है, खून जरा सही करना पड़ेगा, उसकी दवाई करनी पड़ेगी तो आपका ये ठीक हो जाएगा, कहता है की नहीं कहता डॉक्टर? मुख्य बीमारी साफ़ करनी पडती है या नहीं करनी पडती? अब मुख्य बीमारी पड़ोस में है, आप तो जामनगर में पड़ोस में ही है, वहाँ से खब़रे आती रहती होंगी, कच्छ और जामनगर को तो जल्दी ख़बरें आती रहती है।

मुझे इन जामनगर के लोगों को पूछना है भाई, आपको हमारे देश की सेना जो बोले उसमे भरोसा है या नहीं है? सेना जो कहे उसको सच मानना है या नहीं मानना है? मुझे भी मानना चाहिए या नहीं मानना चाहिए? लेकिन कुछ लोगों को पेट में दर्द करता है, अब उसमें भी उनको समस्या हो रही है।

भाइयों बहनों, इस देश को गर्व होना चाहिए कि हमारी सेना ये ताकत दिखा रही है साहब। मैंने अभी.. दिल्‍ली में मेरा एक भाषण था। उस भाषण में मैंने कहा देश पूरा गर्व कर रहा है, अदभुत पराक्रम किया है, जवानों ने पराक्रम किया है और किसी भी देश को होना चाहिए। उसमे मुर्दे की तरह रोते रहने की क्या जरूरत है भाई। मैंने उनसे कहा देखिए आज अगर हमारी वायुसेना के पास राफेल होता तो परिणाम कुछ और ही होता। अब जिनको मेरी बात समझ नहीं आती है उसमे मेरा दोष है क्या भाई? अब उनकी मर्यादा है मैं क्या करूँ? जब मैं ने ये कहाँ उन को तो उन्होंने ये कहा की मोदी तो ऐसे इंडियन एरफ़ोर्स ने जो किया उसी को प्रश्न पूछ रहा है। अरे मेहरबान, साबू इस्तेमाल कीजिए न साबु इस्तेमाल कीजिए न... साबु यानी सामान्य बुद्धि।

एयर स्ट्राइक्स के समय पर हमारे जवानों के हाथ में राफेल होता तो हमारा एक भी जाता नहीं और उनका एक भी बचता नहीं। ये मेरा हिसाब है भाई। लेकिन इन देश के वीरों को प्रणाम, इस देश की वीर प्रजा को प्रणाम और हमारा संकल्प है इस देश को तबाह करनेवाले कोई भी लोग होंगे उनके आका उस पार बैठे होंगे तब पर भी ये देश शांति से नहीं बैठेगा। अब उनका क्या है, हमारे विरोधी इसमें भी उनको समस्या हो गई मोदी क्या करता है, मोदी क्या करता है, मोदी क्या करता है अरे आ कर देख लीजिए न भाई ये किया। उनका मंत्र है आओ, साथ मिलो मोदी को ख़त्म करो। देश का मंत्र है आओ एक हो, और आतंकवाद ख़त्म करें। उनको मोदी को ख़त्म करना है हमे आतंकवाद को ख़त्म करना है, आप मुझे कहिए भाइयों, आतंकवाद खत्म करने वाले के साथ जाना चाहिए या नहीं जाना चाहिए? आतंकवाद खत्म करनेवाले की इच्छा के साथ जुड़ना चाहिए या नहीं जुड़ना चाहिए?

बहुत-बहुत सलाम भाइयों। मेरे साथ बोलिए,

भारत माता की – जय

भारत माता की – जय

धन्यवाद।

                How is everyone? Hope you all are in best of spirits!

My best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Shivaratri. May Bholenath bless everyone!

Before I begin, I want you all to say along with me thrice - 

Bharat Mata ki Jai for Mighty India!

Bharat Mata ki Jai for Victorious India!

Bharat Mata ki Jai for the brave soldiers!

My dear brothers and sisters of Jamnagar who have gathered here in such great numbers to bless me!

Today is the auspicious occasion of Shivaratri and Gujarat is a place that possesses two Jyotirlingas. The land of Somnath and Nageshwar are really auspicious and I am grateful that I have got the opportunity to visit these two places on this auspicious occasion of Shivaratri.

When I was the Chief Minister, I used to attend meetings of Chief Ministers all over the country. I used to tell them - ""you think that there is no problem in Gujarat. Everything is hunky-dory."" I used to explain them and they did  feel surprised. I used to tell them that Gujarat was a state that didn't have enough resources. There was a greater problem of water scarcity. Our several villages used to be in dire need of water. The region used to suffer from drought for about 7 out of 10 years. The government used to be confused as to how to deliver drinking water to those areas. If God had given us the facility of water, we would have taken India to great heights. That was the power we possessed. 

 

Our budget, the entire strength of the state government had to be diverted towards fulfilling the water needs. The Chief Ministers from all over India never believed that Gujarat had so many problems. They just could not guess. But there was our resolution too. It is true that we don't have perennial rivers and we receive scanty rainfall. But we cannot just keep on cribbing over the fate if we want to take Gujarat on the path of development. Kutch used to be scantily populated as there was lack of water. So we decided to solve the water problem first. We would bring water to the region and turn Gujarat into water-sufficient region. It is true that there were a lot of hurdles before the Sardar Sarovar Dam. And all the governments of those periods are responsible for those hurdles. They cannot escape! They have to give answers. If 40 years back, the work on the Narmada had been completed, Gujarat wouldn't have to spend so much money on water that it did over the last 40 years. Now that the Sardar Sarovar dam is completed, the region is getting water. Prior to that, when the dam was under construction, we had to face a lot of trouble while supplying water to Kutch and Kathiawad. We formulated a scheme called 'Sauni' Yojana. When I announced about the scheme for the first time in Rajkot, a few people started saying that Modi is presenting this scheme with an eye on the elections. Elections keep going on somewhere or the other. Whatever I do, the people start linking that with elections. At that time, everything seemed impossible; spending thousands of crores of rupees, carrying water to a height equivalent to a 20-storeyed building. This seemed impossible because we were used to seeing only tankers and hand-pumps. We had never thought of a greater solution that those things. 

 

On one hand was that mentality; those people had ruled who couldn't see beyond the tankers. While we are those people who take the initiative to get huge 500-700 kilometers long pipelines constructed for water. These pipelines are so big that one can drive a Maruti car inside it. As a result, today water is reaching those areas through the SAUNI Yojana. The BSF soldiers are able to drink the fresh water of river Narmada at the border of Kutch because of the power of technology, engineering techniques and willpower. I am glad that even after leaving Gujarat, our team is engaged in the work of fulfilling the dreams in a time-bound manner with the same dedication. And all the phases of the SAUNI Yojana are getting completed one after the other. I always used to say that the water of Narmada is not water but Paras (philosopher's stone). Just like the touch of Paras can turn iron into gold, similarly the touch of Narmada can turn the land of Gujarat into greenery so that it produces gold. Our farmers will sweat it out but when that sweats confluence with Narmada, the sweat will start glowing. And Gujarat has shown that today.

 

Today I have also got the opportunity to dedicate the new schemes for the expansion of the Guru Gobind Singh ji Medical College here. We all should know and remember that Gujarat has a special connection to the Guru-tradition. One of the 'Panj-Pyare' of Guru Gobind Singh ji, belonged to Gujarat's Dwarika and was from the community of tailors. He had gone to Guru Gobind Singh ji as his disciple and had offered his life. The son of a tailor from Dwarika had gone to Guru Gobind Singh ji and had joined and worked for the Sikh tradition. He was one of the five soldiers. At that time, Dwarika was part of Jamnagar. Consequently, this hospital was named after Guru Gobind Singh ji. 

 

This name was an attempt to make that incident in history immortal. And today we have taken a major revolutionary step towards healthcare with this hospital. Such a revolution is taking place in Gujarat and the entire India. I will be heading towards Ahmedabad from here. There are four projects related to hospitals. What is the reason? In today's time where we are leading a hectic lifestyle, modern treatment will not be possible without hospitals and modern technology. 

 

There was a time when all the people used to be healthy. There used to be just one Vaidya Raj or doctor for the entire village and the village used to be healthy. Now times have changed. There are separate doctors for left eye and right eye. This is an era of specialty. We too have to get ready for that. Today modern hospitals are being built in Gujarat. It will directly benefit the people. Moreover, there are schemes like Ayushman Bharat and MA scheme - Mukhyamantri Amrutam Yojana. When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had started one Chiranjivi Yojana so as to ensure that the mother's delivery takes place in hospital, and mothers' lives are saved and children's lives are saved. This scheme was highly successful. Thereafter, we kept on formulating schemes one after the other in relation to healthcare in Gujarat. After I started working in the Central government, I started the Ayushman Bharat scheme and it is the biggest scheme in the world. 

 

You all know that I am not fond of small things. Whatever I do, I do it in a large scale. Didn't that happen now? The pipelines usually measure 500 km, 900km or 700km in length. We don't work in bits and pieces. Similarly, the Ayushman Bharat Yojana will benefit the population more than the combined population of America, Canada and Mexico. 

 

The government will provide up to Rs.5 lakhs of treatment to any poor family in a year and to any member of that family. He will never have to be poor. Moreover, the poor can get treatment in the biggest hospitals. He wouldn't have to go to a government hospital and return home in the evening waiting for the doctor. He has the right. More than 15000 major private hospitals in the country have agreed to cooperate with us in the work. 

 

Moreover, if a brother living in Jamnagar goes to Bhopal and falls ill, he would not have to come back to Jamnagar. He could get himself treated in Bhopal's hospital free of cost just by showing the card. Similarly, if he goes to Kolkata or Cochin, he would get free treatment in those cities too. 

 

So, the common man should receive healthcare services. Due to these initiatives, the possibility of big hospitals in small towns has increased. It has created a possibility of setting up about 2000-3000 big new hospitals throughout the country. A large area will be developed. When one hospital is set up, it provides employment to thousands of people. They require people for every big and small task like technicians etc. The nation will be swept up with revolution in the field of healthcare. And I have got the opportunity to come here for one such hospital. 

 

There is one issue with water. The problem begins when a person crosses the limit. Even after starting the massive 'SAUNI' scheme, the need for water is still not fulfilled looking at the Gujarat's water scenario that lacks perennial rivers and sufficient rainfall. Therefore, there is a need to frame a scheme to convert sea water into sweet water on a large scale by spending crores. And the foundation stone of one such project has been laid today. Turning the sea water into sweet water and distributing it to the people.

 

This means that we should use water by considering it as God's Prasad. Gujarat has no right to waste water. The poor gets water after so much of hard work. If the poor were to receive one rupee, 80 paise was given to him and 20 paise was kept aside for water. What is the reason? Without water life will not be possible. If we had to construct 1 lakh rooms in schools, 20,000 rooms less were constructed and that money was saved for water. Similarly, some amount of money was kept aside from the construction of hospitals and used for water. 

 

A small amount of money has to be kept aside for water in every region of Gujarat. This means that water is the most valuable thing. In such a scenario, it is the responsibility of every person in Gujarat to save water. The farmers should use drip irrigation. Saving water is mandatory for us. There is a need to create an environment where every drop of water is properly used. The sanitation campaign achieved a great success, and has turned into a mass movement. This time the people of Gujarat visited the Kumbh Congregation and praised the clean environment there. The cleanliness at the Kumbh Congregation has touched the people. It created a sanitation movement in the country.

 

Mahatma Gandhi had visited Kumbh 100 years back and had expressed his desire for a clean Kumbh. It was not done for 100 years but we did it. Therefore, just like the sanitation campaign has been successful, the 'save water' movement can also be successful within Gujarat. Yes or no? Can we move in that direction? And today as we are Consecrating Lord Shiva with Narmada water, on the auspicious occasion of Shivaratri, let Gujarat take a vow to save water. You will see how a massive revolution will sweep Gujarat. 

 

Today several projects related to the railways have also been framed. The work of electrification, gauge conversion, double lining etc. is going on at double the speed compared to earlier. This is not something new for you. You have already seen me working before. But the people of the country are surprised that such a thing can happen too. I ask them to go and see Gujarat. It is possible. Everything is possible when one does the work. Today this is happening in the country. Modern railways, coaches and everything is being done at double the pace compared to before. 

 

We have started the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. Those farmers with less than 5 Acres of land will get Rs.6000 in their bank accounts every year. Rs. 2000 will reach their bank accounts before every season. It will help them to purchase fertilizers, seeds, pesticides. But they have started spreading lies and rumours. Every 10 years, they have this habit of announcing loan waivers just before elections. But they do nothing. The farmers keep suffering for 10 years. And you will be surprised to know that they had promised of loan waivers keeping in mind the general elections of 2008-09. The loans were of Rs.6 lakh crores but they waived how much? Rs.52000 crores! They bluffed and took away all the votes. After the elections the poor farmer used to think that he was not included in the criteria so he was left out. This is how they befooled the people. 

 

We have brought a scheme according to which Rs.75 thousand crores will go into the bank accounts of the farmers every year and Rs.7.5 lakh crores in 10 years. If Rs.7.5 lakh crores are accumulated in the villages, it can transform the economy of the villages. That is, if a person couldn't purchase a bicycle before should purchase one now. He should purchase shoes or socks for his children that he couldn't get them before. He should get good quality utensils at home and cook good food. Likewise, the economy of the village could be transformed completely; whereas when those people used to waive the loans, only 20-25 farmers out of 100 used to benefit in a village. But with our scheme, about 90 out of 100 farmers will be benefitted every year in that village.

 

Brothers and sisters,

In order to get permanent solutions to the problems, when we are working with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', it is benefitting all the people to such a great extent. We have decided to extend the facilities given to the farmers also to the animal rearers. Now even the animal herders will receive the Kisan Credit Card. The animal herders and the fishermen too will receive loans at cheaper interest rates. So, arrangements have been made even for the fishermen. When Atal Ji had formed the government for the first time in the county, during that time for the first time a separate department was formed for the tribal people. Prior to that, there was no department for the tribal people. After the Modi government came to power, a separate ministry has been formed for the fishermen. And work has been done to solve the issues of the fishermen, for their development, and efforts are on to provide modern equipment to the fishermen. We have tried to ensure that even the fishermen just like the farmers are able to get loans on lower interest rates through Kisan Credit cards. We have tried to bring about permanent changes.

 

Today our fishermen are fishing only at the edges where the catch is less. But if they get deeper into the water, their income will increase. The central government is providing subsidy so that their efforts are less and they can get the kind of vessels for deep sea fishing. The Rs.15 lakh subsidy is being provided to the fishermen so that they can earn great incomes through deep sea fishing. 

 

We are trying to ensure that everyone in this country has a house by 2022. Just as I told you that I don't like anything small. I do everything till it is completed, it is big and is done in short span of time. There should not be a single family in the country by 2022 that doesn't own a house. The previous government had constructed only 25 lakh houses while we have constructed 1 crore 30 lakh houses just within 55 months. Therefore, I say that by 2022, every person in the country will get a house. And by house I don't mean just the four walls but also other amenities like gas connection, electricity connection, water connection and schools nearby. Nothing should be incomplete. The work on this scheme is going on and today I have got the opportunity to hand over the house keys to the people in Jamnagar and those who have not received I would like to tell them that Modi government will once again come to power and it is my dream to hand over houses to every person by 2020. Everyone will receive a house. Jamnagar is known for the small enterprises. Therefore, it is a request to Jamnagar which is synonymous with small enterprises to go online to apply for loans. Our government has made several schemes for the small enterprises. For the first time, under this scheme, you don't have to physically go to banks. You can apply online and within 59 minutes loans of up to Rs.1 crore will be approved. Just within 59 minutes!

 

All the leakages have been plugged. There is no need to bribe the bankers or to go after pleasing them. Apply online; submit your documents and you will receive your right in 59 minutes. This government has brought about such a revolution. As a result, Ease of Doing Business has improved from rank 142 to 77. Such a leap forward! This is because all the hassles of license etc. have been removed. And its benefits are being availed by Jamnagar, Morbi and Rajkot. A wonderful environment has been created for the small factories. Therefore, it is a huge advantage for small enterprises, and people working in the engineering field and production field!

 

Wherever was necessary, we kept on modifying the rules of GST and today the GST has been made extremely useful for the common man. The common man is benefitting from it. Earlier the common man could not sell his own product to the central government and the state government. It could be a small product like plastic buckets, tables or chairs. We created a GeM portal. Register with GeM, the producers and the suppliers can write their requirements. The common man sells products worth crores of rupees to the government. There is no need for tenders or middlemen. There is no discrimination or any scope for corruption. The common man directly sells his products to the government. Earlier there used to be big players for tenders. There used to be a chain wherein the smallest producer used to sell to someone on top of him; that person used to further sell it to a person above him and finally there used to be a person on top of everyone who used to sell it to the government. All the money used to go to that big player. But now, the money straightaway goes to the smallest of the producers. The government has taken this bold step. We are giving out its benefits. 

 

Brothers and sisters,

No nation can move ahead without power and resources. There used to be communal clashes in Gujarat. Yes or no? These used to be there even in Jamnagar. Yes or no? Everything has stopped or not? Now everyone is living peacefully or not? Everyone is progressing or not? All those people who were engaged in instigating violence have been curbed therefore, everything is moving smoothly now. Now tell me brothers, should terrorism be eradicated from the nation or not? Not like this. Say it loudly the people of Jamnagar! This disease of terrorism should be eradicated or not? 

 

The infected area needs the medicine or not? When you visit a doctor and he tells you that the problem is in your blood and it needs to be corrected, he would ask you to take the medicine for blood. Isn't it? We have to cure the main disease or not? Now the main disease lies in the neighborhood. Now Jamnagar is its neighbor. You must be getting information from there. Jamnagar and Kutch are the first to receive any kind of information. 

 

I want to ask the people of Jamnagar. Do you trust what the Indian army says or not? Should I consider it as true or not? But a few people have a problem with that. 

 

Brothers and sisters,

The country should be proud of our army's capabilities and power. During a speech in Delhi, I had said that the entire nation was feeling proud of the valour shown by the Indian army. Why a few people should cry like losers amidst that? I told them that if our Indian Air Force had Rafael, the story would have been different. If those people are unable to understand what can I say, what is my fault? That is their limitation. When I said that, they started saying that Modi was questioning the act of Indian Air Force. I say please use your 'Sabu'. Sabu means Samanya Buddhi or Common sense. 

 

During airstrike, if we had Rafael with our Air Force, no plane from our side would have been downed, while none from their side could have escaped. This is my calculation. But I salute the nation's brave-hearts. It is our resolution that we will not leave the enemies of our nation alone. Our opposition has trouble even with that - what did Modi do? What did Modi do? Come and see for yourself what he did. Their Mantra is - 'come, unite and uproot Modi'. The nation's Mantra is -' come, unite and uproot terrorism'. They want to uproot Modi while we want to uproot terrorism. You tell me brothers and sisters. Should we go with those who want to end terrorism or not? Should we connect with the desire of those who want to end terrorism or not? 

 

Salute to you all brothers and sisters! Say along with me -

 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

You have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai!

For the Mighty India - Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Say it loudly, For the Mighty India - Bharat Mata ki Jai!

For the Victorious India - Bharat Mata ki Jai!

For the brave soldiers - Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

Shri Yogi Adityanath ji, the popular and successful Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh; my Cabinet colleague and the Defence Minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman ji; my Cabinet colleague sister Smriti Irani ji; Minister in the State Government Mohsin Raza Ji and Suresh Pasi Ji, MLA Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh ji, Garima Singh ji, Dal Bahadur Kori ji, my dear brothers and sisters of Uttar Pradesh. Jay Ram ji! How are you all doing? Hope everything is alright!

You all have gathered here in such large numbers, my salutations to you all! This had been the Tapobhumi of Tikarmabhi Maharaj of Amethi. This is the land of the writer of Jaimina Mahapuran, Baba Purushottam Das ji. This is the land of Malik Mohammad Jayasi. This land has been the land of the National President of Arya Samaj. I salute this land.

Today I have come here to extend our government's development programmes in Amethi. And today even 'Meghraja' (The Rain God) has been kind to us and has welcomed us. I clearly remember that in the year 1998, I had accompanied Atal ji to attend a public meeting here. Even at that time, it had rained heavily. Since then, I had been visiting Amethi for some or the other work related to the party. After I became the Prime Minister, once again I have got the opportunity to be present amidst you all today.

During the 2014 elections, we had raised the slogan of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. My dear brothers and sisters of Amethi, Amethi is the best example that showcases the essence of our mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. When we talk of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', I used to say and I still say that those who had voted for us are ours and those who hadn't voted for us too ours. The region that has given us a seat is ours and the region that has not given us a seat too is ours. 

And after 5 years, bowing my head before the people of Amethi, I can proudly say that sister Smriti Irani ji had stood before you as the candidate here. She was a new face and a new identity for you all but you all had showered your blessings on her. Even though we couldn't win from here at that time in the elections but we were successful in winning your hearts. With your love, Smriti ji had worked really hard for the development of Amethi during the last 5 years. She never ever felt whether you had elected her or defeated her. She has worked more than the winner. I want to ask the people of Amethi - Are you satisfied with our work? Did you feel that we were always concerned for you? Have we honestly strived for your welfare? Have we done even the slightest injustice to you? Did we do complete justice? This is our mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.

Just a short while ago, projects worth crores of rupees related to the development of Amethi have been inaugurated or their foundation stones have been laid. These include projects related to schools, roads, medical centers, cattle breeding, electricity and several others related to farming.

Brothers and Sisters, 

Besides these projects, today I am going to make a very important announcement. This announcement is related to the new identity and glory of Amethi. Several great leaders might have come here; Amethi will not be known by the name of those leaders. It will be known by the scheme I have brought today. 

Brothers and sisters,

Now one of the most latest, the most modern rifles AK 203 which is also known as Kalashnikov will be manufactured in Korba Ordnance Factory, Amethi. These rifles will be manufactured by a joint venture of Russia and India. Just a short while ago, our country's first woman Defence Minister Nirmala Ji has read the message of President of Russia here. I express my gratitude to President Putin, a very close friend of mine and of India for this partnership. This joint venture has been possible in a very short span of time due to his cooperation. I am very grateful to President Putin for his friendly message and good wishes; I also thank and congratulate Russian friends associated with this joint venture and my best wishes to everyone for its success.

Friends,

A few people go into villages and talk about- made in Ujjain, made in Jaipur, made in Jaisalmer, made in Baroda. Their speeches just remain speeches. But this is Modi. The AK 203 rifles 'Made in Amethi' will definitely enhance the strength of our soldiers during their encounters with the terrorists and Naxalites. Now lakhs of these rifles will be manufactured in the factory of Amethi. The rifles manufactured here will be exported to other countries of the world in the future. Therefore, this factory of Amethi is going to open up employment opportunities for the youngsters and is going to open up a new path for development and security of the country. 

Brothers and sisters, 

The work will begin from today. This work should have started 8-9 years back. This factory of Korba was set up solely for the purpose of manufacturing modern rifles but it was not used to its full capacity. This factory at Amethi is an evidence of the fact that the needs of our Army and soldiers were neglected before. 

Friends,

Our army had put forward the need for modern weaponry in front of the then government in 2005 for the sake of the country's security. During 2007, when its foundation stone was being laid, the Parliamentarian from here had said that the work would begin from 2010 onwards. Did that happen? Was it promised or not? Whatever was said, it should have happened or not? Why do you trust those who couldn't even do the bare minimum? But friends, let alone starting the work, the previous government couldn't even decide upon the types of weapons that would be manufactured in the Ordnance Factory. Moreover, even the land was not made available for the factory to be set up. 

Friends,

Just imagine! The factory wherein the work should have been started in 2010 couldn't be set up till 2013. After the factory was built, work had started somehow because they had to show off before the elections. Yet, modern rifles were still not manufactured. And don't forget, they say that they keep their promises and never lie - this too is a big lie. And don't forget that they had promised to give employment to 1500 youngsters. They had promised to provide job to1500 people in the factory. I am talking about Amethi not the nation. But these people who make tall promises had befooled the people of Amethi and only 200 people got the jobs. Today they are delivering speeches regarding employment throughout the country. 

My brothers and sisters of Amethi,

Now after waiting for so many years, one of the world's latest modern rifles will be manufactured in Amethi's Ordnance Factory.

Friends,

I want to ask you something. Wasn't it an injustice done to our brave soldiers by not manufacturing the modern rifles? Was it an injustice or not? Wasn't it an injustice done to the resources by not utilizing the Ordnance Factory to its full capacity? Wasn't it an injustice done to the youngsters of Amethi by not providing them with employment?

Friends,

The previous government had left no stone unturned in neglecting the safety of the Defence forces. It is essential to remind the nation about how our brave soldiers were kept waiting for bullet-proof jackets. In 2009, the Army had demanded 1 lakh 88 thousand bullet-proof jackets. Our soldiers were fighting against the bullets of the enemy forces and terrorists without the bullet-proof jackets. They were engaging in life-threatening encounters with the terrorists putting their lives at stake. They didn't purchase the bullet-proof jackets even within 5 years from 2009 to 2014. Five years are not less. It was our government that ordered more than 2 lakh 30 thousand bullet-proof jackets during the last four and a half years. 

Today as I have visited Amethi, I wish to know from you all that who were those people who had made our brave soldiers wait for rifles and bullet-proof jackets? Who were those people? I won't take names but you all are well aware of their identities. Therefore, brothers and sisters - Bharat Mata ki Jai! You know them and I don't have to name them.

Brothers and sisters,

Not only modern rifles and modern bullet-proof jackets but the same people had made the nation wait for modern cannons as well. This is our government that has signed a deal for modern cannons and now these are being manufactured within India.

Friends,

Just like modern cannons, our Air Force had been demanding modern fighter aircrafts for several decades. But how could those with wrong intentions hear the voices of the Air Force? They kept on sitting on the Rafael deal for years! While the government was leaving they had just shelved the deal. It is due to the efforts of our government that the first Rafael aircraft will be in the skies of India in a few months. But these people are still trying to create obstacles in the Rafael deal and are trying to thwart our efforts for their personal interests.

Brothers and sisters,

Every institution from the Supreme Court to the CAG saying that the Indian government has made the right decision at the right time and has done the right deal in the country's interest. But these people are continuously spreading lies. The frustration of not being able to get commission in defence deal could be clearly seen on the faces of a few people. 

Friends,

Just like their half-hearted attempts towards the nation's security and negligence of the country's safety, they have also behaved in a similar way with the people of Amethi. What promises were made to Amethi? Whereas what's the actual condition of Amethi today? No one knows that better than you all!

Brothers and sisters,

This is the result when there is a lack of intention and willpower to do something for the welfare of the poor and instead just lies are spread. Try to recall, the steel plant located here had to be shut down because there was no arrangement for gas. The same thing happened to the Meghapur Food Park here. So, when we thought of the steel factory, we arranged for the gas. Now this steel factory is ready to give jobs to Amethi and to further increase the steel production in the country.

Brothers and sisters,

The cycle factory of Goliganj that was supposed to be set up had met with a similar fate. They took away the land of the farmers but didn't set up the factory and fraudulently took over the ownership of the land. In the name of development of Amethi, your feelings have been played with this way.

Friends,

When self-interest lies only in power and propagating the family's name becomes the only goal, then it is quiet natural that the needs of the country will be neglected. When welfare of the family and relatives becomes the priority, then the feeling of working for the welfare of the common man ends. Unfortunately, this is what has happened in Amethi.

I was watching one TV report, wherein a report on a Dalit village here was shown. It was told that the houses that were given to the Dalits in 2008 were on the verge of crumbling down within the span of 10 years. The people living there were saying that although the MP had given his name to that residences, but had forgotten the people after that.

Friends,

You are a witness to the treatment that was meted out to the people of Amethi. And you can clearly see how our government has worked towards the development projects here.

More than 9000 houses have been constructed in Amethi under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Efforts have been made to make the lives of the people here easier by giving free gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme, by providing free electricity connection under Saubhagya scheme and by constructing toilets.

Brothers and sisters,

Forgetting the people after garnering votes is the habit of a few people. They want to keep the poor perpetually under poverty for generations so that they could keep on raising the slogans of 'Garibi Hatao'. We are trying to empower the poor so much so that they could come out of the poverty at the earliest. This is the reason why today India is considered among those nations where poverty is getting reduced at a rapid pace. A few people do not have sensitivity towards the poor at all.

Friends,

The treatment that was meted out to the poor, the farmers too met with a similar fate. These people had never tried to empower the farmers. They kept on neglecting their all kinds of needs. If the farmers were exasperated by their schemes, they would trap the farmers into the delusion of loan waivers. Last time in 2008, they had waived the loans of only Rs.52 thousand crores while the country's farmers had a debt of Rs.6 lakh crores. 

Moreover, the benefits of the loan waivers reached 3 to 3.5 crore farmers of the country on an average, i.e. if there are 100 farmers in your village, hardly 20-25 farmers could avail the benefit. The rest of the benefits were taken away by their contractors, brokers and middlemen. On the other hand, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme of our government will benefit 12 crore farmers of the country. A few days back, the first installment of Rs.2000 has already reached the bank accounts of crores of farmers. Those who have not yet received the money will soon get the benefit. 

Friends,

This scheme is so massive that in the coming 10 years, Rs.7.5 lakh crores will be delivered to the farmers’ accounts directly. Just imagine! The villages, farmers and the rural economy of the country will be empowered to a great extent! This will also benefit thousands of farmers of Amethi. He would be able to do a lot of things like purchasing fertilizers, seeds and pesticides or paying electricity bills with the help of this money. 

Brothers and sisters,

Your Prime Servant is able to work for you, the farmers, the soldiers or our country's young sons and daughters because of your blessings and strength. Looking at your enthusiasm I can say that Amethi and the people of Amethi are going to create a new history; a history whose echo will be heard all over the country.

Friends,

I also give special thanks to Smt. Smriti ji for the development of Amethi. Once again, I also thank the Russian President Putin ji whose message was read by the country's first lady Defence Minister Nirmala ji. Now the world has clearly understood the women power. The nation that has a woman Defence Minister has clearly shown the world how steps should be taken for the security of the nation.

Once again, I express my gratitude to this huge wave of people in Amethi that has gathered here to bless me. Say along with me -

 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, visited Kauhar, Amethi in Uttar Pradesh today. He dedicated to the nation, the Joint Venture of Indo-Russian Rifles Pvt Ltd, for Kalashnikov Assault Rifle Production.

He also laid the Foundation Stone and dedicated various development projects in Amethi.

In his special message on the occasion, which was read out by Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that “the new joint venture will manufacture world famous Kalashnikov assault rifles of the newest 200 series and eventually will reach full localization of production. Thus, the Indian defence-industrial sector will have the opportunity to fulfill the needs of national security agencies in this category of small arms, resting upon advanced Russian technologies.”

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister thanked President Putin for this partnership. He said lakhs of rifles will be made from this facility in Amethi, and will strengthen our security forces.

He also said that this development has been long delayed. He said that this delay in the production of modern rifles for our soldiers, actually amounts to an injustice to the jawans. He recalled that despite projecting a requirement for bullet-proof jackets in 2009, no such jackets were procured till 2014. This requirement has now been fulfilled by the Union Government, he added. He said that earlier, such delays had also been happening in procurement of other important armaments. In this context, he also mentioned the Rafale fighter planes, and said these will start joining the Air Force within a few months, as a result of the efforts of the Union Government.

He also mentioned other development projects in Amethi, which were facing various bottlenecks in operationalization. He said those bottlenecks were being removed, so that the projects could be operationalized, and provide employment to people. He said the implementation of schemes such as PM Awas Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, Saubhagya Yojana and construction of toilets, in Amethi, is now bringing ease of living to the people.

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government is empowering the poor, and helping them come out of poverty. He said similarly, the farmers are being empowered. In this context, he mentioned the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. He said this scheme will ensure that 7.5 lakh crore rupees reach farmers over the next ten years.

                Dear friends!

I welcome you at the launch of the Russian-Indian enterprise for production of Kalashnikov assault rifles.

Military and technical cooperation has traditionally been one of the key areas of special and privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India. For more than seven decades, we have been supplying reliable and high-quality armaments and equipment to Indian friends. Around 170 military and industrial facilities have been set up in India with assistance from our country.

The new joint venture will manufacture world famous Kalashnikov assault rifles of the newest 200 series and eventually will reach full localization of production. Thus, the Indian defence-industrial sector will have the opportunity to fulfill the needs of national security agencies in this category of small arms, resting upon advanced Russian technologies.

Let me remind you that it was during my official visit to India last October that my counterpart and friend Mr Modi and I reached the agreement on setting up Kalashnikov production in this country. The respective intergovernmental agreement was prepared and signed in the shortest possible time. In this regard, I would like to express gratitude to Russian and Indian specialists, to all those who so promptly made this project happen.

I am convinced that commissioning of the new enterprise will contribute to stronger defence potential of India, to further advance of the scientific and industrial basis of the national economy, will be instrumental in terms of creating new jobs for qualified work force, and will provide an impetus to professional education and personnel training. The plant itself will become another symbol of friendship and constructive cooperation between our two countries.

I wish you every success and all the best.

                I sincerely compliment all you young colleagues who are diligently working towards the resolve of New India, Smart India!

This is the third opportunity which has provided me a platform to connect with you all through ever evolving technology interface. Since the inception of this campaign in 2017, the scope of this has only been expanding continuously.

Friends, Smart India Hackathon has emerged as one of the largest “Open Innovation Model” at the national level which amalgamates a large number of industries, educational institutions, government agencies, professionals and students who work together on the same platform. Starting with 30 thousand students, this Hackathon has reached a partnership of 2 million today. Today I can vouch that our efforts arein the right earnest, and we are progressing in the pertinent direction.

Friends, many innovative ideas have emerged from the previous two editions of the Hackathons. Prior to this, only problems faced by government and government institutions were included in these Hackathons, but this time the industry has also put forth their problems to you.

This will definitely increase the scope of your efforts, and bring you more recognition in the market/enhance your market value as an Innovator. Friends, our economy is running onward on a new track. The New India, which we all are aiming to establish, is fast becoming a force to reckon with in the world of Innovation and Start-Up.

Today, in the scale of Global Innovation Index, we are ranked at number 57, whereas we stood at 81 in 2014. That clearly shows it catapulted in four years. We are not in any mood to stop here, as very soon we have to achieve a reckoning in top-25. India is the world's third largest start-up nation today. In the last 3-4 years, over 15 thousand Start-ups have been recognized. These are not limited to big cities, but are spread in almost every district of the country. It is epochal that more than fifty percent of the new start-ups are from smaller towns in the country. 

Likewise, the number of start ups in over 150 technology business incubators of the country has reached three thousand this year from 1600 three years ago. That is double the numbers. Friends, it is the result of several concerted and concrete efforts that today there is a positive environment for Innovation and Start-ups.

You all are familiar with the Atal Incubation Mission. Under this scheme, Atal Tinkering Labs are already operational today in more than 5000 schools across the country, where students are directly acquainted with Future emerging Technologies from as early as Sixth grade. Friends, along with the challenges faced in governance and industry which have already been posed in front of you, I also personally solicit your support on a few of other issues. 

Today, crime against children and women is a major challenge. To build a better society, it is very important to deal with it. Can you think of such a technical solution, where an integrated system of monitoring/tracking children from home to school and school to home can be made possible? Along with school and home, this system makes possible to activate the local police station and petrol vans in real time. This type of integrated and smart system, which is easily accessible and affordable by the lowest income family, is the need of the hour and shall prove very helpful to the country and society.

Similarly, can we evolve a technical solution like e-marketplaces for the local fruits and vegetables vendors who operate from the streets, which eases their system of home delivery at a very local level?

Friends, we need to make Smart India Hackathon very robust and establish it as a continuous process rather than relegating it to a mere annual activity. It should continue round the year so that any industry or department can pose their problem and motivate problem solvers to engage proactively by declaring an award for successful solutions. I believe that many young people like you will be inspired to join it and will be able to solve problems too.

I have full faith in all of you, on each and every youth of this country. All of you are the pillars of the confident New India.

                न्यू इंडिया, स्मार्ट इंडिया के संकल्प को सिद्ध करने में जुटे आप सभी युवा साथियों का बहुत-बहुत अभिनंदन !

ये तीसरा अवसर है जब मैं निरंतर तकनीक के माध्यम से आप सभी से बातचीत कर रहा हूं। 2017 में जब से ये अभियान हमने शुरु किया है, तबसे इसका निरंतर विस्तार होता जा रहा है।

साथियों, स्मार्ट इंडिया हेकेथॉन राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर होने वाला सबसे बड़ा Open Innovation Model बनकर उभरा है, जहां एक ही प्लेटफॉर्म पर बड़ी संख्या में इंडस्ट्री, एजुकेशनल इंस्टीट्यूट्स, गवर्नमेंट एजेंसीज़, प्रोफेशनल्स और स्टूडेंट्स एक दूसरे के साथ मिलकर काम कर रहे हैं। 30 हज़ार स्टूडेंट्स के साथ शुरु हुआ ये हैकेथॉन आज 2 लाख की भागीदारी तक पहुंच चुका है। आज मैं कह सकता हूं कि हमारे प्रयास सही हैं और हम सही दिशा में आगे बढ़ रहे हैं।

साथियों, अभी तक जो दो हेकेथॉन हुए हैं, उनमें से अनेक Innovative Ideas निकले हैं। इससे पहले सिर्फ सरकार से जुड़ी, सरकारी संस्थानों से जुड़ी समस्याओं को हैकेथॉन में शामिल किया गया था, लेकिन इस बार इंडस्ट्री ने भी अपनी प्रॉब्लम्स को आप सभी के सामने रखा है।

इससे निश्चित रूप से आपके प्रयासों को भी विस्तार मिलेगा और एक Innovator के रूप में भी आपको मार्केट में ज्यादा पहचान मिल पाएगी। साथियों, हमारी अर्थव्यवस्था एक नए ट्रैक पर दौड़ रही है। जिस न्यू इंडिया के निर्माण में हम सभी जुटे हैं वो Innovation और Start-Up की दुनिया में अपना झंडा गाड़ रहा है।

Global Innovation Index के मामले में आज हम 57वें स्थान पर हैं, जबकि 2014 में हमारा नंबर 81 था। यानि 4 वर्ष में 24 स्थानों का जंप हमने लिया है। हम यहीं रुकने के मूड में नहीं है, बहुत ही जल्द हमें टॉप-25 में पहुंचना है। भारत आज दुनिया का तीसरा बड़ा स्टार्ट अप नेशन है। बीते 3-4 वर्षों में 15 हज़ार से अधिक Start-ups Recognize किए गए हैं। ये सिर्फ बड़े शहरों तक ही सीमित नहीं हैं, बल्कि देश के लगभग हर जिले में फैले हैं। बड़ी बात ये भी है कि जो नए स्टार्ट खुले हैं, उनमें से आधे, देश के छोटे-छोटे शहरों में हैं।

इसी तरह देश के करीब डेढ़ सौ टेक्नॉलॉजी बिजनेस इंक्यूबेटर्स में स्टार्ट अप्स की संख्या जो तीन वर्ष पहले तक 1600 थी वो इस वर्ष 3 हज़ार तक पहुंच चुकी है। यानि 2 गुना वृद्धि। साथियों, Innovation और Startup के लिए अगर ये पॉजिटिव माहौल बना है तो इसके पीछे कई ठोस प्रयास हैं।

अटल इंक्यूबेशन मिशन से तो आप सभी भलीभांति परिचित हैं। देशभर के 5 हज़ार से अधिक स्कूलों में अटल टिंकरिंग लैब्स आज काम करना शुरु कर चुकी हैं, जहां Sixth Class से स्टूडेंट फ्यूचर टेक्नॉलॉजी से सीधे परिचित हो रहा है।

साथियों, गवर्नेंस और इंडस्ट्री की जो चुनौतियां आपके सामने अभी रखी गई हैं, उनके साथ-साथ मैं अपने भी एक दो आग्रह आपके बीच में रखना चाहता हूं।

बच्चों से जुड़े अपराध, महिलाओं से जुड़े अपराध एक बहुत बड़ी चुनौती है। एक बेहतर समाज के निर्माण के लिए इससे निपटना बहुत ज़रूरी है। क्या आप सभी एक ऐसे तकनीकी समाधान के बारे में सोच सकते हैं, जहां घर से लेकर स्कूल और स्कूल से लेकर घर तक बच्चों की निगरानी का एक इंटिग्रेटेड सिस्टम हो सके। जिसमें घर और स्कूल के साथ-साथ स्थानीय पुलिस स्टेशन और पेट्रोलिंग वैन भी रियल टाइम में एक्टिवेट हो पाए। इस प्रकार का इंटीग्रेटेड और स्मार्ट सिस्टम जिसको सामान्य से सामान्य परिवार भी उपयोग कर सके, देश और समाज की बहुत मदद करने वाला है।

इसी प्रकार क्या सड़क पर या गलियों में फल-सब्जी बेचने वालों के लिए कोई ऐसा तकनीकी समाधान, ई-मार्केटप्लेस जैसा कोई समाधान विकसित कर सकते हैं, जिससे बहुत ही लोकल स्तर पर होम डिलिवरी का एक आसान सिस्टम बन सके।

साथियों, स्मार्ट इंडिया हेकेथॉन को सिर्फ एक सालाना एक्टिविटी के तौर पर देखने के बजाय एक निरंतर प्रक्रिया के तौर पर देखना होगा। ये पूरे साल भर होता रहे, ताकि कोई भी इंडस्ट्री या विभाग अपनी समस्या पोस्ट करे, उस पर कोई पुरस्कार घोषित करे। मुझे विश्वास है कि आप जैसे अनेक युवा साथी इससे जुड़ेंगे और समस्याओं का समाधान भी हो पाएगा।

मुझे आप सभी पर, देश के मेरे एक-एक युवा साथी पर पूरा भरोसा है। आप सभी New India के नए आत्मविश्वास के आधार हैं।

                The Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of India Today Group, Arun Puri ji, all the journalist friends of your group, the journalists who are working in the Newsroom right now, stringers associated with you, the other dignitaries present here and my dear friends!

My best wishes to all the people associated with ‘India Today Conclave’. I congratulate you all for your participation in the Swachh Bharat Campaign, and your efforts towards creating awareness in people. 

Friends,

I was asked to share my experiences with you all about my learning during the leadership of the nation. 

After 2014 elections, when I came to Delhi, I really didn't have enough experience back then about how the central government worked and how the system functions etc.

And I believe it proved to be a boon to me. Had I been a part of the older system, I would have fitted into the system as it is. But that didn't happen.

Friends,

I remember that prior to 2014, there used to be discussions in your studio that Modi did not have any knowledge about the foreign affairs. What would happen to our foreign policy?

But after the past incidents, you might have seen where the impact of India's foreign policy has reached today.

Have you seen it or not?

Okay, at least you agreed.

Friends,

Today's India is a 'New India', a transformed India. For us, the blood of each and every soldier is invaluable. Earlier, even if many used to die or several soldiers used to be martyred, there used to be hardly any counter action. But now, no one dares to do anything to India. Our government is committed to taking decisions for the welfare of the nation. Today, India is working on a new policy and strategy and the entire world is able to understand this.

Friends,

Today's 'New India' is fearless and decisive because today the government is moving ahead with the hard work and faith of 125 crore Indians. 

India's unity has induced fear in a few anti-national people both inside and outside the country. 

I would say that this fear psychosis is good. When the enemy is afraid of India's feat, then this fear is good. When the terrorists fear the valour of the soldiers, then the fear is good. When the fugitives are also afraid of the law and seizure of their property, then this fear is good.

When big families get scared of Mama's revelations, then this fear is good.

When the corrupt politicians have a fear of going to jail, then this fear is good.

When corrupt people fear the law, then this fear is good.

Friends,

The country has suffered a lot in the decades that followed Independence. 

Now this New India is moving forward counting on its strengths, its capabilities and its resources and is trying to overcome its basic weaknesses and to reduce its challenges.

 

But friends, there is one more challenge before this progressive India. 

The challenge is - self-satisfaction by talking against our nation and making a mockery of it by some people. 

I am astonished that when the entire nation is standing with the Indian army, there are a few people who are suspecting the army itself.

On one hand, the entire world is supporting India in the war against terrorism, while a few parties doubt our fight against terrorism.

These are the same people whose statements and articles are being used by the Pakistani Parliament, radio and television channels against India. 

These people have turned into anti-national from being anti-Modi. They are harming the nation.

I want to ask all such people from this forum today that do you believe in the strength of our army or are you skeptical?

I want to know from them that whether they trust our army or trust those people who are promoting terrorism on our soil?

Brothers and sisters,

I want to tell all such people and parties that Modi will come and go, but India will always be there. Therefore, I request them to stop playing with the security of the nation for their political advantage and for satisfying their ego. Kindly, stop weakening the nation.

Friends,

The nation has felt the need for Rafael today. The nation in a single voice is asking what could have happened if we had Rafael today. 

The country has suffered a lot due to self-interests on Rafael earlier and now due to politics on Rafael.

I want to tell these people that they are free to oppose Modi, and to find faults in our schemes, their impact etc.

Criticize the government on this; you are always welcome but do not oppose the country's security interests.

Keep in mind that this obstinacy of opposing Modi is turning these terrorists like Masood Azhar and Hafiz Sayeed into more powerful entities. 

Friends,

Those who ruled the nation for many years had interests in two things - doles and deals.

The culture of doles and deals harmed our nation’s development journey greatly.

Do you know the biggest sufferers of this approach? Our Jawans and Kisans!

Let me talk about the defence sector first.

Why is it that those who ruled the nation for so many years have so many defence scams in their era?

They began with Jeeps and later graduated to weapons, submarines, helicopters.

In the process the defence sector suffered.

If a deal could not happen, defence modernisation could not happen.

Who is every deal maker close to? Who is every middle-man close to? The entire nation knows.

And Lutyen’s Delhi surely knows!

Friends,

It is common knowledge that one of the things our armed forces regularly need is bullet proof jackets.

In 2009, our forces made a request for one lakh eighty six thousand bullet proof jackets.

You would be ashamed to know that not one, I repeat not one bullet proof jacket was obtained from 2009 to 2014.

In our tenure we bought two lakh thirty thousand bullet proof jackets!

In our tenure, the corridors of power are also free from middlemen because they know this Government will not tolerate any corruption.

Now, let me talk of doles. Those in power loved giving doles.

These doles were not aimed at empowering the poor.

These doles were given so that the poor remain poor and remain at the mercy of the political class.

The best example of this is the farm loan waivers.

No economist or policy expert will ever say farm loan waivers can solve our agrarian issues.

It is a temporary balm at best.

Every ten years, UPA came out with a farm loan waiver idea.

They did nothing in their full tenure but at the eleventh hour, offered a farm loan.

There is nothing tangible in their waivers.

It benefits less than 20% of the farmers.

Yet, they love to fight polls on farm loans.

We have taken a different approach.

The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, a comprehnsive scheme for farmer welfare.

No dole or deal - only good deed.

Six thousand rupees in three parts to 12 crore farmers of India!

The scheme was announced on 1st February and launched on 24th February. We worked 24 hours non-stop and launched it in 24 days!

Previously, this much time would be taken to decide a very important question - after which member of the family should we name the scheme?

And unlike waivers, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi is a long term and long lasting assistance.

Our other schemes are like this too - be it Soil Health cards, PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana, E-Nam - they are not doles, they are concrete long term measures to increase farmers’ incomes by 2022.

It was the NDA Government that had the honour of bringing a historic hike in MSP for farmers.

When the previous Government was in power, a file for MSP was kept in cold storage for almost seven years.

Thus, while they work for 10% commission, we work with 100% mission and when a Government works with a strong mission, all-round development becomes possible. 

Friends,

Our fifty five months and the fifty five years of the others have given two contrasting approaches to governance.

They had a ‘token approach’; we have a ‘total approach.’

For everything, they had a token to offer. Let me elaborate.

India has been battling poverty but they gave a token slogan- Garibi Hatao.

How to achieve that was not specified and neither did they make any effort to remove poverty.

But, they went place to place saying – Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao.

It was known that India needed to work on financial inclusion. For that they gave a token - bank nationalization.

They did this in the name of the poor but none of them bothered to check if the doors of banks are open for the poor or not.

Take the case of One Rank One Pension.

A forty year old demand was left hanging but during their last budget in 2014, a token amount of five hundred crore rupees was added. They knew very well that this was not even close to the amount needed. But then again, token!

And the elections that were approaching!

Before 2014 what was their poll plank - increasing gas cylinders from 9 to 12.

Imagine – such a large national party, with years in government is reduced to fighting a poll on 9 to 12 cylinders.

This way of giving tokens is not acceptable to us.

If work has to be done, it has to be in totality, not with tokenism.

That is why, all our initiatives aim for one hundred per cent.

Jan Dhan – financial inclusion and banking for all.

Housing for All - a house for every Indian by 2022!

And, we are making remarkable progress in this direction.

One Point Five crore homes have already been created, compared to 25 lakh homes made by UPA.

Healthcare for All - Ayushman Bharat - no Indian must be deprived of good and affordable healthcare. 50 crore Indians will benefit from this scheme.

One Rank One Pension - compare their 500 crore to the thirty five thousand crore that was eventually given by the NDA government as a part of OROP.

Ujjwala Yojana - while they were busy between 9 and 12 cylinders, we have worked to give smoke free kitchens to crores of families.

Power for all - every village and every household should have electricity.

The 18,000 villages in darkness for seventy long years have now been electrified and now the focus is on household electrification. 

So, you can see, we are working with both speed and scale.

Everything has to be for all, not a select few.

Enough of tokenism, the time has come for a total transformation where the fruits of development reach each and every citizen.

Friends,

Aaj Tak is known for raising good questions. But today, even I want to raise a few questions from Aaj Tak's platform.

 

Why were crores of people forced to defecate in the open till date?

Why was the government not sensitive towards the 'Divyangjans' till date?

Why was the water of river Ganga so polluted till date?

Why was the Northeast neglected till date?

Why was there no National War Memorial for the brave warriors of our country till date?

Why was there no National Police Memorial for the heroic and corrageous policemen till date?

Why the flag was not hoisted in the Red Fort in memory of the government of Azad Hind Fauj till date?

If I continue with the series of questions on the stage of Aaj Tak, it can make a 'special' bulletin of several hours. 

Whether you launch an attack on the basis of these questions or not, whether you make a special story on these questions or not, but the fact is that earlier no meaningful effort was made to connect the poor, oppressed and the deprived sections of the country to the system. But I have not come here to question only; I would also like to give some of the answers without you asking what we have achieved and what we are achieving.

You call yourself 'Sabse Tez' (the fastest). This is your tagline - Sabse Tez'.

 

So I thought of letting you know about me and my government that how fast we are!

We are alleviating poverty at the fastest rate in India today.

Today we are the fastest growing economy in the world.

If we look at the GDP growth rate from 1991, it has increased at the fastest rate during the last 5 years by us. 

If we look at the inflation rate from 1991, it has been reduced at the fastest rate during the last 5 years by us. Today roads are being constructed at the fastest pace. The development work of the railways is progressing at a rapid pace. We are building houses for the poor at the fastest rate. Today the mobile manufacturing units are being set up at the fastest pace within the country. Laying the optical fiber network is going on at the fastest speed in the country. Today FDI is flowing into the country at the fastest rate. The measure of cleanliness is increasing at the fastest rate in the country today. 

So, just like 'Sabse Tez' is your tagline, 'Sabse Tez' is our government's lifeline.

Brothers and sisters,

When I had visited you in 2013, I had narrated a story about two friends. Once two friends had ventured into a forest; it was a scary forest so they were carrying a good quality gun to protect themselves from dangerous wild animals. They wanted to walk through the forest. As they entered the thick forest, suddenly a lion appeared in front of them. Now, what they could have done? They had left the gun in the car. It was a dangerous situation. How to deal with that situation? They couldn't have escaped. 

But one of them took out the license of the gun and showed it to the lion. 

Friends,

When I had narrated that story to you all back then, the government was in a similar situation. The previous government had formulated several Acts but there was no action on them. 

After we formed the government, we have taken action in implementing the Acts. I want to give a few more examples to tell you the difference between that period and current period. 

Friends,

The Benami Property law was passed in 1988 but was never implemented. That is, the Act had never been brought into action.

Our government has implemented this law and has seized the Benami property of thousands of crores of Rupees.

You must have seen the condition of the Food Security Act during the previous government's regime. It was brought with a lot of pomp and show. But when our government came to power, we were shocked to see that this Act was implemented in only 11 states that too in an incomplete way.

For the first time, our government implemented this law in all the states and Union Territories of the country and ensured that its benefits reached the public.

There were the same government officials, the same files and the same offices earlier too. But everyone knows the results.

We emphasized upon action and look at the pace at which the development work has been going on. 

Friends,

Although this period between 2014 and 2019 is of 5 years, but if you traverse on the path of development to assess the performance of our government, you will find that you have travelled through decades of development.

I say it with confidence because there is 5 years of hard work of our government and blessings of the 125 crore Indians.

2014 to 2019 was a period of fulfilling the needs while the period beyond 2019 will be the period of fulfilling the aspirations.

2014 to 2019 was the period to deliver the basic needs to every household while the period after 2019 is the time to take off for faster development.

 

The period between 2014 and 2019 and after 2019 is a story of changing dreams, of moving from the situation of despair to the pinnacle of hope, of moving from resolution to accomplishment.

Friends,

We have read a lot in books that the 21st century will belong to India.

With the hard work of the last 5 years, we have strengthened the foundation-stone of the nation. The magnificent structure of New India will be built on this foundation-stone. 

Today I say with certainty that yes! The 21st century will belong to India. 

With this belief, I end my speech. 

I thank you from the bottom of my heart for inviting me to the ‘India Today Conclave’ and to give me the opportunity to put my thoughts forward.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, addressed the India Today conclave in New Delhi today. 

He appreciated the India Today Group for the awareness spread by them about the Swachh Bharat Mission. 

Reflecting on his tenure so far, as Prime Minister, he said that his relative lack of experience at the national level turned out to be a blessing in disguise. 

Taking the example of apprehensions that were expressed with regard to conduct of foreign policy, he said that the events of the last few days would have set at rest doubts in this regard. 

He asserted that today's India is a New India and a different India. He said the life of every soldier is precious, and today no one can mess with India. He said the Government is committed to taking every decision in national interest. 

He said certain elements both inside and  outside the country, who are against the country, are fearful of this unity seen in India. He added that this fear, is actually good. He said enemies are fearful of India's valour, and the corrupt are fearful of the law, and this  fear is good. He said New India is marching ahead, confident of its abilities and  resources. 

He questioned the stance of those, who doubt the intentions of the Government and the Armed Forces. He said that in opposing Narendra Modi, these people have started opposing India as well, and are harming the country. He said such people doubt  the Indian Armed Forces, but trust those who foment terrorism in India. Specifically, he said that India  felt the absence of the Rafale fighter jet recently, over which a lot of politics has been played. He strongly criticized those whose actions adversely affect national security. 

He said that those who ruled the nation for many years had interests in two things - doles and deals. He said that the biggest sufferers of this approach were our Jawans and Kisans.

He said that the defence sector suffered because of the deals made by some, while agriculture suffered because there was no concrete policy beyond doles. These doles were given so that the poor remain poor and remain at the mercy of the political class, he added. The best example of this is the farm loan waivers, he said. He explained that the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, a comprehensive scheme for farmer welfare, is part of the Government's different approach to empower farmers. It was launched within 24 days of announcement, he added. 

He explained that fifty five months of his Government, and the fifty five years of the others have given two contrasting approaches to governance.

They had a ‘token approach’, we have a ‘total approach,' he said. In this context, he mentioned initiatives taken in the areas of One Rank One Pension for the Armed Forces; financial inclusion for the poor; clean cooking fuel (Ujjwala Yojana); Power for all; and Housing for all. 

He asked a series of questions, such as why India was not Open Defecation Free till now; why there was no War Memorial or Police Memorial built for so many decades, etc. 

He said India is today removing poverty at a rapid rate, and is the fastest growing large economy. He explained how Infrastructure is being built at a rapid rate. He said that his Government believes in combining Acts (laws or initiatives) with Action. He said the period from 2014 to 2019, was to fulfil basic necessities for all; while the period from 2019 onwards is the period of fulfilling aspirations and achieving new heights of progress.

The Prime Minister emphasized the commitment of the Union Government towards ensuring that every family’s dream of a home, becomes a reality.

The Prime Minister said that the need for the Global Housing Technology Challenge, was felt in the light of rapid urbanization in India. He said that elements from several schemes, including PM Awas Yojana, HRIDAY and AMRUT, are oriented towards transforming the housing sector. He said that adapting technology to different geographical conditions is also a challenge.

The Prime Minister said a lot of emphasis has been placed on affordable housing, real estate sector, skill development, and housing technology.

The Prime Minister reiterated his dream that every Indian should have a proper house by 2022, and 1.3 crore houses have been made in his tenure. He called upon everyone to work together to enhance capacities and help the poor.

The Prime Minister said that the Government is also making it easier for people to buy houses, through tax and other incentives. He said the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, (RERA), has improved consumers’ confidence in developers and brought transparency in the Real Estate Sector. He said a large pool of skilled human resource has been created, especially in the rural areas. He said that in the construction sector, there is now much greater focus on disaster-resilience, energy efficiency, and local innovation. 

The Prime Minister said that the Global Housing Technology Challenge is a platform that can help elevate India’s construction ecosystem to international standards. He declared that the period from April 2019 to March 2020, will be observed as the Construction Technology Year.

                Greetings to all those gathered here today. You are all important stakeholders in the historic effort to provide a home for every Indian. 

It is the second time in a month that I have got the opportunity to interact with the people involved in the housing sector. And it showcases the seriousness of our commitment towards fulfillment of the dreams of a house for the middle class. And I can see that several friends present here were also present in the CREDAI programme. 

Friends,

In Talkatora stadium, I had told my young friends of the housing sector to boost this sector as per the zeal and needs of the New India.  And for this they should use latest technologies in construction and housing sector available around the world. Our government is always ready to support you and talk to you in your endeavours. And the greatest evidence of the same is this conference related to construction technology.

 

This is the second time I am interacting with those associated with the housing sector. This shows the desire of the Government to keep engaging with you all, know more about your good work, understand your suggestions and work towards a vibrant housing sector. It also shows your passion and commitment towards a strong housing sector, that benefits the poorest of the poor in our country. I understand that members participating in this Conference will either showcase innovative housing technologies, or will learn from the new innovations that are being showcased. This too, is very valuable.

Friends,

The need for today's conference or the Global Housing Technology Challenge was felt because the cities are expanding and developing at a rapid pace within the country. India is among those countries where urbanisation is occurring rapidly. With the rapidly growing urbanization, the need for new homes is equally felt.

Friends,

Our government has worked simultaneously on seven flagship missions to change the face of the housing sector. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana, National Urban Livelihood Mission, HRIDAY and AMRUT have been implemented. Besides, transportation in the cities is being changed and schemes like Smart Cities are being implemented. Keeping this in mind, today we have a challenge to build houses according to different geographical conditions.

Friends,

Keeping these challenges in mind, our government has worked with a holistic approach in the construction sector. We have made decisions keeping in mind the kind of problems that both the builders of homes and buyers of homes were facing. We have mostly emphasized upon affordable housing. Secondly, we have modified the laws related to the real estate sector. Thirdly, we have worked on skill development and fourthly, apart from all of this, we have also focused on improving technology in the housing sector. Today's programme is also relates to it. And I remember that in a meeting of PRAGATI, you may be aware of my meetings of PRAGATI, so I am not getting into the details. In one of the meetings of PRAGATI, I had advised the ministries to adopt a global challenge process. Today I am glad that you are all here through the Global Housing Technology Challenge, India.

Friends,

A house is not only four walls. It is that place where the power to dream comes and aspirations are fulfilled. A home is as much about dignity and security, as it is about shelter. It always shocked and saddened me that in a nation like ours, several people do not have their own home. We have been working to solve this situation in the form of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. It is my dream that every Indian has a Pukka house by 2022. And, we are walking the talk in this regard. During our tenure, over 1.3 crore houses have been made already. To give you an idea of the scale, the previous Government made only 25 lakh houses! The numbers speak for themselves. Our work does not stop at making four walls. We are ensuring the houses have water connection, power connection, Ujjwala connection and other such facilities. The quality of houses and the space per home has also improved in the last four and a half years. But, there is more to be done and for that, I seek the support of the private sector. And what better way to do it than the Global Housing Challenge. Let us work together, enhance our capacities and do something that helps the poorest of the poor.

Friends,

The way the dream of the poor and the middle class of owning a house was fading away, was not right. In order to change this situation, we have worked together at different levels. We have tried to bring solutions to each and every problem faced by the poor and the middle class in buying a house. As a result of our government's efforts, today, the interest rates on hone loans have been reduced compared to before. The relaxation provided by the government under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana will help the people to save an estimated amount of Rs-5 lakhs to Rs.6 lakhs. That is, if a person has taken a loan of Rs.19-20 lakh for 20 years, then with the help of these schemes, he will definitely save Rs.5-6 lakhs.

Friends,

Our government has modified the laws related to income tax and indirect taxes and it was done so that the poor and the middle class had more money left to buy a house and the prices of the houses were also reduced. Recently, these two major decisions were taken by the government and the GST Council. Speaking of income tax, taxable income up to Rs. 5 lakh has been brought under the 0% tax bracket. Besides, no income tax has to be paid on an estimated rent of two houses. Similarly, now capital tax will be exempted on two houses instead of one. These myriad efforts are going to encourage the middle class to buy a new home. It is certain that your business will also be directly benefited. You can have a round of applause.

Friends,

GST has made the real estate business very smooth for both developers and customers. Recently, the GST has been reduced to a great extent on the construction sector. GST has been reduced from 8% to 1% on Affordable Housing, while GST on Under Construction Housing Projects has been reduced from 12% to 5%. Affordable Housing Fund has also been created for the purpose of funding in projects for the middle class.

Friends, we understand that in order to make more homes and better homes, we also have to be sensitive to the suggestions of those in the housing sector. And, we are doing that. We have been working to strengthen and reform the housing sector. From RERA Act, which improved consumers’ confidence in developers and brought transparency in the Real Estate Sector, to our significant improvement in the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business Index” driven by improvement in construction permits, where India climbed from 181st rank to 52nd place - we have been consistently focusing on systemic reforms. 

Friends,

You will be benefitted in yet another way from the government's policies. A huge pool of human resource has developed especially in the rural areas that know about the technique of constructing houses. They are trained in it. Our government has also started a campaign for training women in this sector. Thousands of women are working as main workers after this training campaign.

We want to increase the technical skill of the youth in this sector to make them market-ready so that entrepreneurs like you also benefit, and more opportunities are also available for young friends. Besides, changes in our engineering and technology courses on the basis of rapidly changing technology are also being worked out in this direction. Moreover, this sector is also emerging as a new option for start-ups and young entrepreneurs.

Friends, 

We have made another reform in the approach of construction in India. Now whether there are roads, residential apartments or commercial buildings, we are encouraging eco-friendly, disaster-resilient and energy-efficient construction. This requires Local Innovation, in which our young partners are engaged.

Friends, 

You will be glad to know that ASHA-India, the Affordable Sustainable Housing Accelerator, is investing in such innovations as per the market. ASHA is part of GHTC-India. In this, work is going on at the four incubation centers in Mumbai, Madras, Kharagpur and Roorkee IITs to make the Ideas of young entrepreneurs and Startup Eco-system useful according to the market.

Friends,

I am pleased to know that some students working on such areas like innovation, technology and engineering are also present here. The discussion here will also pertain to the National Knowledge Network (NKN) so that educational institutions of the country can take advantage of it. Educational Institutes will also be given the opportunity to solve the challenges that will be discussed here through this network.

You can be a part of this amazing experiment in India related to the Housing Technology. Light House Project is being started for the same. These projects are being started in Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. You can showcase new techniques of construction. These are Live Laboratories for you. Here you can interact with the youth professionals of the country through technologies like webcast demos.

 

GHTC-India is a platform through which India's Construction Sector can reach the level of eco-system international. Through this we will find Global Solutions for our challenges.

Looking at your enthusiasm, I assert that this is the beginning of the revolution and now we are moving in the direction of changing the construction sector of our cities according to global standards.

Friends, 

This conference will not only benefit India but also the builders, architects, planners and Global Civil Engineering Firms around the world. We are going to learn a lot from each other.

Friends,

There are immense possibilities for your sector in New India's new business environment. Neo middle class is spreading rapidly in the country. India is among the select countries of the world where demand for houses is growing at the fastest rate.

I also declare the year from April 2019 to March 2020 as Construction Technology Year in order to fulfil this demand and make the maximum use of modern technology in construction. 

Friends,

Today I have got the opportunity to dedicate an Atlas here. You will be surprised to know that for several years the disaster related issues used to be under the Agriculture Department. It was part of the agriculture department for years because the definition of disaster was limited to floods and drought. Such a limited thinking! Thus, the people associated with the agricultural sector used to handle it. After the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, it was realized that it was a serious challenge. After that, the important aspect was handed over to Home Ministry that coordinates with the states. It was a great paradigm shift which was done during Atal ji's regime. We must prepare the country to face something before it happens. Efforts were made first at district level in Gujarat wherein disaster prone areas were chalked out and district wise maps and village maps were created. I am glad that today the central government has made different zones in the country. And I would like the people associated with the construction work, builders and those laying the pipelines, the gas pipelines to frame their respective plans keeping this Atlas in mind. I would also like to tell the government that they should make a reference to the fact that the Atlas had been studied during their tender system. You should mention how you are going to address the things mentioned in this Atlas before you start the work in that particular area. It will be institutionalized only after that. Similarly, the universities related to planning, engineering, architecture or structure in those regions should include vulnerability of those areas in their syllabus so that when the human resource develops in those areas, they will be aware of the challenges in construction and the way with which they can go about construction work.

Therefore, I would like all the experts like you to organize a 2-day workshop in your respective companies on the Atlas. We should see and try to understand the Atlas and the things related to it because we need to take these things forward. You will realize the strength of India. There are several things that draw comparatively less attention. All those associated with construction sector have expertise in how India can move ahead in this sector for a long time but those who have seen this year's Kumbh would have realized that the make-shift arrangement could be made so wonderfully and be made so much technology driven! The nation has shown that.

 

More than 22 crore people might assemble on the bank of river Ganga within 40 days. Every day, in a way, a country of Europe gathers on the banks of Ganga. The nation has shown that cleanliness of that place could be so well maintained. Moreover, our youngsters have shown how the Central Command System could work through technology and invoking the smart city concept during the Kumbh Congregation. That is, our nation has that capability. If we try to explore how the people can develop even better systems and if the make-shift arrangements can be so nice, then having a permanent arrangement in place will be a model for the world. And I believe that these two day brainstorming sessions will help us to come up with the ideas that will not only improve the condition of your company but also of the construction sector and will add a new strength, momentum and freshness to it. And believe me, whatever India does, the world closely watches that. This nation has the power to change the meaning of the words in dictionary. 'Abhinandan' means congratulations but now it will have a different meaning. This is the strength of this nation.

Come; let us move ahead with this belief. We have to move forward as a mighty nation and we have to take steps one after another to fulfil the dreams in a time bound manner. The government is with you.

Once again my best wishes to you all for this conference.

Thanks a lot!

                Friends.

I am delighted to be here in Kanyakumari.

I begin by paying homage to respected Amma, Jayalalithaa Ji.

Her good work for the people of Tamil Nadu will be remembered for generations.

I am happy that the Tamil Nadu government is working hard to fulfill her development vision.

I am proud that India's first woman Defence Minister Nirmala Ji is from Tamil Nadu.

Every Indian is proud that the brave Wing Commander Abhinandan belongs to Tamil Nadu.

I would also like to congratulate the Vivekananda Kendra on being conferred the Gandhi Peace Prize a few days ago.

The community service efforts of the Kendra are commendable and inspiring.

Friends.

A short while ago, we inaugurated and laid the foundation stone for several development works related to roads, railways and highways.

I have flagged off the fastest train, Tejas between Madurai and Chennai.

This is one of the most modern trains and is a great example of ‘Make in India’ having been manufactured in the Integral Coach Factory of Chennai itself.

The foundation stone of a railway line between Rameshwaram and Dhanushkodi has also been laid today.

This line got damaged after the disaster of 1964 but for over fifty years, no attention was paid to this line.

But, better late than never!

You would be happy that the new Pamban rail bridge is going to be constructed now.

Friends.

Today India is the fastest growing large economy in the world.

India is creating next generation infrastructure at a record pace.

We are among the nations with the largest start-up eco-system.

India is also home to the largest healthcare programme in the world- Ayushman Bharat.

Friends.

India of the 21st century has to work with speed and scale, which is what the NDA Government is doing.

Just last Sunday, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi that was announced in this year’s Budget was launched.

Under this scheme, farmers having up to five acres of land would be given a monetary support of six thousand rupees per year from the Central Government in three instalments.

Over 1.1 crore farmers have already got their first instalment directly in their bank accounts.

Can you imagine, a scheme announced on first February has become a reality in the same month itself.

We worked twenty-four hours non-stop to ensure the scheme is rolled out in twenty-four days.

Friends.

Like leap years and Football world cups come once in four years, incomplete loan waivers of the Congress come just before an election.

After doing nothing for farmers, they will come at the end and say- we will waive off your loans.

In reality, Congress loan waivers benefit few farmers.

NDA government’s Kisan Samman Nidhi is not a once in a few years scheme.

Benefits will be given every year and in ten years, about 7.5 lakh crore rupees would have gone to hard-working farmers.

When a government works with speed and scale, it clearly shows.

Friends.

The great sage Tiruvalluvar said “When the rare chance comes, seize it to do the rare deed.”

In 2014, it was after thirty years that a Party got a full majority in the Parliament.

The people’s message was clear- they wanted a Government that takes the lead in taking and bold and tough decisions.

People wanted honesty, not dynasty.

People wanted development, not decay.

People wanted progress, not policy paralysis.

People wanted opportunities, not obstacles.

People wanted security, not stagnation

People wanted inclusive growth, not votebank politics.

Guided by ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ and with the active participation of 130 crore Indians, the NDA government has undertaken some of the most historic decisions in national interest.

Let me give you a few local and national examples.

Tamil Nadu is a coastal state, where the fisheries sector is vibrant.

Several of our fishermen brothers and sisters work hard to earn their living.

It is the NDA government that has had the honour of creating a new department for fisheries.

Previous governments came to take your votes but when it came to doing work for fishermen, they had nothing much to show.

The benefits of Kisan Credit Card have also been launched for our fishermen and women.

The Centre has released over Rupees three hundred crores towards construction of Deep Sea Fishing Vessels in Tamil Nadu.

Fishermen in the sea get help from space.

We have provided Navic devices developed with the help of Indian Space Research Organization. This device provides information in local language.

This navigation device not only provides details of fishing zones but also provides weather related warnings to the fishermen.

Friends.

We understand that if we want to increase the income of Fishermen brothers and sisters, then we have to develop infrastructure associated with fisheries.

The construction works of Mukayur Fishing Harbour in Ramanathapuram district and Pumpuhar Fishing Harbour in Nagapattinam are almost completed.

Friends.

The Government of India is most sensitive to the safety and well-being of fishermen.

Due to sustained diplomatic efforts, since May 2014, more than nineteen hundred fishermen have been released by Sri Lankan authorities.

Friends.

NDA government has put renewed focus on our coastal areas, with stress on connectivity and prosperity.

Going a step ahead of port development, we are working on port-led development.

More ports are being created.

The capacity and efficiency of existing ports are being improved. The Sagarmala project is also a part of our vision.

Work is being carried out on this project keeping in view the needs of not only the present but also future generations.

Friends.

Let me also talk about defence and security.

With the blessings of our ex-servicemen, we took the historic decision of making One Rank One Pension a reality.

It was the right thing to do.

Those who ruled the nation for so many years never even bothered to think about OROP properly.

Friends.

India has been facing the menace of terrorism for years.

But, there is a big difference now- India will no longer be helpless in the wake of terror.

From 2004 to 2014 there were several terror attacks.

There were blasts in Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and other places.

The nation expected those responsible for these acts of terror to be punished but nothing happened.

26/11 happened, India expected action against terrorists but nothing happened.

But, when Uri happened you saw what our brave soldiers did.

Pulwama happened and you saw what our brave air warriors did.

I salute all those who are serving the nation.

Their vigilance keeps our nation secure.

There was a time when the news reports would read- Air Force wanted to do surgical strike after 26/11 but UPA blocked it.

And today, we are in an era where the news reads- Armed forces have full freedom to do what they want.

Influence of terrorists and terrorism has been curtailed and it is going to be curtailed even more.

This is a New India.

This is an India that will return the damage done by terrorists with interest.

Friends.

The events of the past few days have demonstrated yet again the strength of our armed forces.

It has also brought our nation closer.

The way the nation has supported our armed forces is extra-ordinary and I bow to every Indian for that.

Sadly, a few political parties, guided by Modi hatred have started hating India.

No wonder, while the entire nation supports our armed forces, they suspect the armed forces.

The world is supporting India’s fight against terror but a few parties suspect our fight against terror.

These are the same people whose statements are helping Pakistan and harming India.

They are the same people whose statements are being happily quoted in the Parliament of Pakistan and in the radio of Pakistan.

I want to ask them- do you support our armed forces or suspect them?

They should clarify- Do they believe our armed forces or they believe those forces who support terrorism on our soil?

I want to tell these parties- Modi will come and go, India will remain.

Please stop weakening India to strengthen your own politics.

In matters of defence and national security, we are Indians first and Indians only.

Your politics can wait, it is the safety of our nation that is at stake.

Friends.

Let us talk about corruption and black money.

India has seen Prime Ministers who said- out of every Rupee, only fifteen paisa reaches the poor.

India has seen arrogant Cabinet Ministers who say, ‘Zero Loss’ to a scam worth lakhs of crores.

Some people say corruption as a way of life.

This would be acceptable to them but not to me.

The NDA government has taken historic steps against corruption.

Fake companies have been shut, fake beneficiaries removed.

The corrupt now have to answer for their misdeeds.

The famous re-counting minister, who took pride in treating people badly, insulting the middle class, he has to now apply for a family pack for bail just like his party’s First Family.

Friends.

While we have come down heavily on corruption, we are at the same time rewarding the honest tax-payers.

During the budget exactly a month ago, it was announced that those earning upto Rupees Five Lakhs would not pay income tax!

Did those who ruled India for such long years think about the middle class or to give them tax relief?

Friends.

For many years, the Congress promoted an economic culture that benefitted only the friends and family members of big dynasties.

The common man had no incentive or ability to economically prosper.

If there was someone who spoke out against the economic culture of the Congress it was the son of Tamil Nadu, C. Rajagopalachari.

Today we are fulfilling the dreams of Rajaji by creating an economy that is reform oriented and people-friendly.

India’s ranking for ‘Ease of Doing Business’ has come risen by 65 places.

We are now placed 77th while we were placed 142 four years ago.

Central Government announced a series of benefits for the MSME sector last year.

Now, it is possible to get a loan up to Rupees one crore in 59 minutes!

That is faster than the time you will take to reach Chennai.

Friends.

We are betting on India’s youth and their talent.

That is why, the Mudra Yojana was launched to give wings to the spirit of enterprise of young India.

Under Mudra, 15 crore people have got loans totaling worth over Rupees seven lakh crore.

Tamil Nadu is one of the top states under this scheme.

Friends.

The Opposition has no commitment to social justice.

The worse atrocities against Dalits have happened under Congress rule.

Congress got Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar defeated not once but twice.

Congress did not give a Bharat Ratna to Dr. Ambedkar for forty years and nor did Congress put Dr. Ambedkar’s portrait in Central Hall of Parliament.

It was a BJP supported non-Congress Government that did both these things.

Friends.

The current NDA government has made the strongest amendments to the SC ST Act.

Economic and social justice are articles of faith for us, not slogans to win votes.

Friends.

The 2019 Lok Sabha elections have two distinct sides.

Our side offers strength and stability.

The other side offers weakness and vulnerability.

Our leadership and work culture is known across India.

The other side is a confused.

They have no name to offer as the nation’s next leader.

No aim or vision for India’s growth.

And no shame that prevents them from doing record corruption.

India remembers 2009, and how the DMK and Congress allotted portfolios after the elections.

Ministers were being picked not by the Prime Minister but by those who had nothing to do with public service.

There was telephone bargaining for minister posts.

The Maha Milaawat or adulteration government will remain hostage to individual egos and dynastic ambitions. 

My only family is 130 crore Indians.

I will live for them, I will die for them.

I am not in public life to further a dynasty.

I am here to do whatever I can for the growth of India.

I seek your support and blessings to create an India where the dreams of the poorest of the poor are fulfilled. 

Thank you for joining the rally in such large numbers.

Bharat Mata Ki Jai.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today flagged off the Tejas Express between Madurai and Chennai. At a large public function in Kanyakumari, he also laid the Foundation Stone for the restoration of rail connectivity between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi, and the restoration of the Pamban bridge. The Prime Minister inaugurated some road projects as well.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that every Indian is proud that the brave Wing Commander Abhinandan belongs to Tamil Nadu.

He also congratulated the Vivekananda Kendra on being conferred the Gandhi Peace Prize a few days ago.

He said the Tejas Express is one of the most modern trains and is a great example of ‘Make in India.’

He said that the Rameswaram-Dhanushkodi rail line got damaged after the disaster of 1964 but for over fifty years, no attention was paid to this line. Better late than never, he added.

The Prime Minister said as part of the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, over 1.1 crore farmers have already got their first instalment in their bank accounts. He said a scheme announced on 1st February has become a reality in the same month itself. We worked 24 hours non-stop to ensure the scheme is rolled out in 24 days, he added. He said in ten years, about 7.5 lakh crore rupees would have been received by hard-working farmers.

The Prime Minister said that people want honesty, development, progress, opportunities and security from the Government.

Talking about defence and security, the Prime Minister said that India has been facing the menace of terrorism for years. He said that the big difference now is that India will no longer be helpless in the wake of terror. He said that this is a New India that will return the damage done by terrorists with interest. In matters of defence and national security, we are Indians first and Indians only, the Prime Minister asserted.

The Prime Minister also elaborated upon the steps taken by the Union Government against corruption.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the continuation of the Biomedical Research Career Programme (BRCP), and Wellcome Trust (WT) /  DBT India Alliance beyond its initial 10-year term (2008-09 to 2018-29) to a new five year phase (2019-20 to 2023-24) with Department of Biotechnology (DBT) increasing its commitment to two times that of WT.

The total financial implication will be Rs. 1092 crore with DBT and WT contributing Rs.728 crore and Rs.364 crore respectively.

Over its 10 years of funding in a 1:1partnership, the Programme has fulfilled its objectives of building and nurturing talent of highest global standards in cutting-edge biomedical research in India, which has led to important scientific breakthroughs and applications to meet societal needs.

BRCP has made it attractive for high quality Indian scientists working abroad to return to India, and has increased the number of locations geographically within India where world-class biomedical research is undertaken.

In the extending phase, the Programme would continue to build this capacity as also strengthen clinical research and work towards addressing important health challenges for India.  Continuation of the Programme with increased stake from the Government of India is important to bring about these returns.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for accession of India to (i) The Nice Agreement concerning the International classification of Goods and Services for the purposes of registration of marks, (ii) The Vienna Agreement establishing an International Classification of the figurative elements of marks, and (iii) The Locarno Agreement establishing an International classification for industrial designs.

Accession to the Nice, Vienna and Locarno Agreements will help the Intellectual Property Office in India to harmonise the classification systems for examinational of trademark and design applications, in line with the classification systems followed globally.

It would give an opportunity to include Indian designs, figurative elements and goods in the international classification systems.

The accession is expected to instill confidence in foreign investors in relation to protection of IPs in India.

The accession would also facilitate in exercising rights in decision making processes regarding review and revision of the classifications under the agreement.

Benefits:

 The move will be helpful in bringing uniformity in Judicial Service.

Enhanced pecuniary jurisdiction will accelerate the justice delivery system, besides making access easier for litigants without having to travel outside the Union Territory.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for creation of the Post of Technical Member in Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), Mumbai at the level of Secretary to the Government of India in the pay scale of Rs. 2,25,000/- (fixed) or Level 17 of the Pay Matrix as per the 7th Pay Commission. 

 

Benefits:

          Creation of the post will facilitate the creation of an additional bench in SAT, Mumbai thereby allowing speedy disposal of the increased number of appeals in SAT with respect to Securities and Exchanges Board of India, (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), which will be much beneficial to investors, pensioners and the general public. The securities market and insurance sector are growing rapidly. With increase in the volume of trading in securities market, and clients in the insurance sector, it is likely that the grievances will also increase. Therefore, it is necessary that a speedy redressal system is established. It would ensure speedy disposal of appeal cases related to insurance, securities market and pension benefitting the general public.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved Measures to promote Hydro Power Sector. These include Declaring Large Hydropower Projects (HPO) as part of non-solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO)

 

Details:


	Large Hydropower Projects to be declared as  Renewable  Energy source (as per existing practice, only hydropower projects less than 25MW are categorized as Renewable Energy). 
	HPO as a separate entity within non-solar Renewable Purchase Obligation to cover LHPs commissioned after notification of these measures (SHPs are already covered under Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation). The trajectory of annual HPO targets will be notified by Ministry of Power based on the projected capacity addition plans in hydropower sector. Necessary amendments will   be introduced in the Tariff Policy and Tariff Regulations to operationalize HPO. 
	Tariff rationalization measures including providing flexibility to the developers to determine tariff  by  back loading of tariff after increasing project life to 40 years,  increasing debt repayment period to 18 years and introducing escalating tariff of 2%;
	Budgetary support for funding flood moderation component of hydropower projects on case to case basis; and 
	Budgetary support for funding cost of enabling infrastructure i.e. roads and bridges on case to case basis as per actual, limited to Rs. 1.5 crore per MW for upto 200 MW projects and Rs. 1.0 crore per MW for above 200 MW projects.


 

Major Impact including employment generation potential:

As most of the hydro power potential is located in the higher reaches of Himalayas and North- East Region, it will result in overall socio-economic development of the region by providing direct employment in the power sector. It will also provide indirect employment/ entrepreneurial opportunities in the field of transportation, tourism and other small scale businesses. Another benefit would be of having a stable grid considering 160 GW capacity addition by 2022 from infirm sources of power like solar and wind.

 

Background:

India is endowed with large hydropower potential of 1,45,320 MW of which only about 45,400 MW has been utilized so far. Only about 10,000 MW of hydropower has been added in the last 10 years. The hydropower sector is currently going through a challenging phase and the share of hydropower in the total capacity has declined from 50.36% in the 1960s to around 13% in 2018-19.

 

Besides being environment friendly, hydropower has several other unique features like ability for quick ramping, black start, reactive absorption etc. which make it ideal for peaking power, spinning reserve and grid balancing/ stability. Further, hydropower also provides water security, irrigation and flood moderation benefits, apart from socio-economic development of the entire region by providing employment opportunities and boosting tourism etc. The importance of hydropower is increasing even more as the country has targeted to add 160 GW of intermittent Solar and Wind power by 2022 and 40% of the total capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 to honour its Nationally Determined Contribution for Climate Change. However, DISOMS are reluctant sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) Hydro Power due to higher tariff, particularly, in the initial years. One of the reasons for high tariff of hydropower is the loading of cost of flood moderation and enabling infrastructure in the project cost. In this backdrop, the decision has been taken to adopt measures to promote hydropower sector including providing budgetary support for flood moderation cost and enabling infrastructure cost and tariff rationalization measures to reduce tariff and thus the burden on the consumer.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved proposal of Airports Authority of India (AAI) for surrendering encroached AAI’s land measuring 106.76 acres situated at Gandhi Nagar, Bhopal to the State Government of Madhya Pradesh (M.P). It is in lieu of 96.56 acres of land already handed over by the Government of M.P. The remaining 10.20 acres (approx..) of land will be handed over by the Government of M.P. to A.A.I.

 

Benefits:

          In lieu of AAI’s 106.76 acres encroached land, the Government of M.P. has agreed to provide land measuring 96.56 acres approx. which is contiguous to the existing land of Bhopal Airport and can be utilized by AAI for aviation purposes. This will help in freeing up AAI’s land measuring 106.76 acres which is already being utilized by the State Government of M.P. for various purposes i.e. establishment of Government Offices, public amenities services, and for rehabilitation of migrated Sindhi families. In lieu of this land, as of now, the State Government has agreed to provide 96.56 acres of land, contiguous to Bhopal Airport, to AAI, for aviation purposes. Further, the land offered by State Government in lieu of this land can be judicially utilized by the AAI for aviation-related activities. Hence, the approval will benefit people at large.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and U.K. on Cancer Research Initiative. The MoU was signed on 14th November 2018.

Details:

The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative will identify a core set of research challenges that address issues of affordability, prevention and care of cancer by bringing together leading Indian and UK experts across clinical research, demographic research, new technologies and physical sciences. The initiative will provide funding to develop new research alliances and undertake impactful research to enable significant progress against cancer outcomes.

Funding pattern:

Over 5 years, the total research funding for the Initiative shall be £10 million (approx. Rs. 90 crores). CRUK's share for such funding shall be £5 million (approx. Rs. 45 crores). DBT shall match such funding by £5 million (approx. Rs.45 crores). The matching funds will be as per prevailing rates at the beginning of financial year.

Impact: 

Despite the surge in technological, biomedical, clinical, and pharmaceutical innovations aimed at improving cancer outcomes, the overburdened healthcare systems across the globe remain ill equipped to meet the massive burden of escalating cancer care costs. The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative sets forth a roadmap for catalysing collaborations that align the best researchers, scientists, healthcare organizations and institutions to a multi-disciplinary research platform leading to high value, low cost outcomes for cancer care. Through this initiative the number of positions for doctoral-level, post-doctoral level researchers and early career scientists are expected to grow. They will not only be trained in cutting technology but will also be trained in essential leadership and project management skills which would help them in securing tenure-track research positions in academia or in related bio-pharma industry.

 

Background:

The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative is a collaborative 5-year bilateral research initiative by the Department of Biotechnology(DBT), Ministry of Science & Technology, India and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) that will focus on affordable approaches to cancer. Both CRUK and DBT will invest £5 million (approx. 45 crores) each in this 5-year pilot, and seek further investment from other potential funding partners. This is a follow up of the joint statement issued by the two Prime Ministers during the visit of Prime Minister of India; Shri Narendra Modi to UK on April 18, 2018, which states the following:

""As thriving democracies, we share a desire to work closely together and with all who share our objective to support a rules-based international order that upholds agreed international norms, global peace and stability. Together the UK and India are a forcefor good in an uncertain world. We are sharing our experience and knowledge to tackle global challenges. India's Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Cancer Research UK propose to launch a £10 million (approx. Rs. 90 crores) bilateral research initiative which will focus on low cost approaches to cancer treatment.""

Background:

During the Global Mobility Summit held in September 2018, Prime Minister had outlined the vision for the future of mobility in India based on 7 C’s    which are Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-free, Charged, Clean   and Cutting-edge mobility. Mobility has the potential to drive the economy forward and positively impact the lives of citizens both in urban and rural areas. 

 

Affordable, accessible, inclusive and safe mobility solutions are primary strategic levers for rapid economic development and improving ‘Ease of Living’. Shared, connected and clean mobility solutions are increasingly becoming the key principles of effective mobility solutions across the world. Given its commitment to climate goals, India needs to adopt effective strategies to place itself as a key driver of the mobility revolution in the world. 

 

Hence, there was a need felt to establish a dedicated multi-disciplinary Mission that will facilitate cooperative federalism, extensive stakeholder and inter-ministerial consultations and implement end-to-end policy framework for transforming the mobility landscape with particular focus on: 

1.         Manufacturing

2.         Specification & standards

3.         Fiscal incentives

4.         Overall demand creation and projections

5.         Regulatory framework 

6.         Research & Development

 

These initiatives will pay significant dividends to a rapidly urbanising India in the decades to come.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved Continuation of Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), and for incurring expenditure up to Rs. 1000 crore till 2019-20 by Atal Innovation Mission for expanding Atal Tinkering Labs to 10,000 schools in view of their huge success at school level.

Details


	AIM has multiple programs to encourage and support innovation in the country. 
	State of the art Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs) are being established in thousands of schools, world class Atal Incubation Centres (AIC) and Atal Community Innovation Centers (ACIC) are being established for universities and industry, 
	Promotion of product development in areas of national relevance and social importance is being supported through Atal New India Challenges (ANICs).


Financial implications:


	Each ATL receives a grant in aid of Rs. 12 lakhs in the first year, and upto 2 lakhs per year for subsequent 4 years, for maintenance of the ATL equipment and operational expenses. 
	Each selected AIC would be receiving grant in aid upto Rs 10 crore over 3-5 years in tranches per year, based on review and evidence of planned milestones reached. 
	Innovators will receive commercialization and technology deployment grants upto Rs. 1 crore under the ANICs.


Impact:


	The Mission has undertaken many bold and forward-looking initiatives such as Alal Tinkering Labs (ATL) and Atal Incubation Centres (AIC), which have received great traction;
	Many Ministries/Departments of Government of India have initiated innovation related activities with the help and technical support of AIM.
	Under the ATL program, more than 10,000 schools are expected to establish these labs by 2020. 
	More than 100 Atal Incubation Centres (AICs) are likely to established around the country, supporting at least 50-60 startups each over the first five years. 
	More than 100 innovators/startups are expected to receive some support for productizing their innovations. 
	Other programs being supported through Ministries will have even more beneficiaries.
	Each incubator is expected to foster 50-60 technology driven innovative Startups every four years. 
	The 100+ Incubators set up would thus foster 5000-6000 innovative Startups and this will multiply with new incubators being set up. 
	The potential for employment generation from these innovations driven Startups is quite high.


Implementation Strategy and targets:

AIM selects each beneficiary through open, competitive, online applications, and disburses grants directly. Furthermore, AIM leverages its experts and networks around the country to build capacity in ATLs, AICs, etc. connecting various kinds of populations. Additionally, corporate and international partners are connected to AIM beneficiaries, to ensure flow of information and technology between academia, innovation, and the start-up ecosystem as well as provide mentoring support to ensure success of AIM's initiatives. Till date, 5441 Atal Tinkering Labs have been selected across the country, out of which 2171 ATLs  from  623   districts  have already  received the  first tranche of grant-in-aid  for establishment of the labs in their respective schools. 101 Atal Incubation Centres have been selected nationwide, out of which 31 have received the first tranche of grants.    

 Twenty-four Atal New India Challenges (ANIC) have been launched and more than 800 applications have been received. 2-3 winners per ANIC would be selected and receive a grant of upto Rs 1.0 crore in 3 tranches based on review and evidence of planned milestones achieved.

AIM's Mentor of Change Programme is mandated to ensure the success of the ATLs. Through this programme, well-qualified mentors from different professional backgrounds are selected to provide pro-bono mentoring to ATL students over a range of skills. Mentors also collaborate with the School administrators to ensure the ATLs operate in the manner, mandated by AIM. As on date, more than 2,500 mentors are actively mentoring students in over 1,300 ATL schools. 

Background:

AlM's objectives are to create and promote an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship across the country at school, university, research institutions, MSME and industry levels. The Mission has been set up under NITI Aayog, in accordance with the Hon'ble Finance Minister's declaration in the 2015 Budget Speech.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the Scheme to Rebate State and Central Embedded Taxes to Support the Textile Sector. This will enable the Government to take various measures for making exports of apparel and made-ups zero rated. 

Details:

At present, apparel and made-ups segments are supported under the Scheme for Rebate of State Levies (RoSL). However, certain State as well as Central Taxes continued to be present in the cost of exports. The Cabinet decision provides for a scheme to rebate all embedded State and Central Taxes/levies for apparel and made-ups which have a combined share of around 56% in India’s textile export basket. Rebate of taxes/levies has been permitted through an IT-driven scrip system at notified rates. 

Benefits:

The proposed measures are expected to make the textile sector competitive. Rebate of all Embedded State and Central taxes/levies for apparel and made-ups segments would make exports zero-rated, thereby boosting India’s competitiveness in export markets and ensure equitable and inclusive growth of textile and apparel sector.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approvedDelhi Metro's Phase -4 projectcomprising of 3 - priority corridors. The total length of these 3 corridors is 61.679 km. Out of the total 61.679 km, 22.359 km will be built underground and 39.320 km will be constructed as elevated section. These corridors will consist of 46 stations, of which 17 stations will be underground and the rest 29 stations will be constructed as elevated sections.

 

The total completion cost of three metro corridors will be Rs.24,948.65 crore.   The project will be implemented by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC), the existing 50:50 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of the Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD).

 

Connectivity Highlights:

1.   Aerocity to Tughlakabad - 15 Stations (Aerocity, Mahipalpur, Vasantkunj Sector-D, Masoodpur, Kishangarh, Mehrauli, Lado Sarai, Saket, Saket G Block, Ambedkar Nagar, Khanpur, Tigri, Anandmayee Marg Junction, TughlakabadRIy. Colony, Tughlakabad)

 

2.   R. K Ashram to JanakpuriWest - 25 Stations(R.K. Ashram, Motiakhan, Sadar Bazar, Pulbangash, GhantaGhar/SabziMandi, Rajpura, Derawal Nagar, Ashok Vihar, Azadpur, Mukundpur, Bhalaswa, MukarbaChowk, BadliMor, North Pitampura, Prashant Vihar, MadhubanChowk, DeepaliChowk, Pushpanjali Enclave, West Enclave, Mangolpuri, PeeragarhiChowk, PaschimVihar, Meerabagh, Keshopur, Krishan Park Ext., Janakpuri West)

 

3.   Maujpur - Mukundpur - 6 Stations(Yamuna Vihar, Bhajanpura, KhajuriKhas, Soorghat, Jagatpur Village, Burari)

The 3 corridors consist of both underground (22.359 km) and elevated (39.320 km) sections.

Impact: 

These corridors of phase - 4 project will expand the coverage of Metro network thereby connecting more areas of the national capital. On completion of these corridors, the Metro commuters will have more interchange stations which will connect the new corridors with the existing lines of Delhi Metro. The improved connectivity will offer commuters more options of travel by optimization of routes. The addition of 61.679 km network through these 3 new corridors will also reduce congestion on the roads and will thus help in reducing pollution caused by motor vehicles. The Tughlakabad - Aerocity corridor will further improve connectivity to the Airport. The total network length of the Delhi Metro will cross the 400 kilometre mark after the completion of these corridors.

                The Cabinet Meeting Chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi  today approved the grant of Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) facilities to World War-II Veterans, Emergency Commissioned Officers (ECOs), Short Service Commissioned Officers (SSCOs) and pre-mature retirees.

 

As a result, over 43,000 individuals not covered so far under ECHS will be able to avail the benefits of cashless medical treatment under ECHS facilities through a network of over 425 ECHS polyclinics, over 2500 empanelled private hospitals and all Government hospitals throughout the country, subject to certain conditions.  

 

As a special dispensation, war-widows will be exempt from one-time contribution to join ECHS.  

 

Launched by NDA Government in April 2003, ECHS provides quality medicare to 54 lakh ex-servicemen pensioners, their dependents and a few other categories. 

 

Measures for welfare of Ex-Servicemen:

 

Today's decision is yet another landmark step in the pro-active policies of the Government since its very first days for welfare of our valiant ex-servicemen, who rendered valuable service to the country.   

 

Implementation of 'One Rank One Pension' for ex-servicemen, a demand which had been pending for over four decades, has resulted in over 20 lakh ex-servicemen receiving more thanRs. 35,000 Crore under the scheme.  Other welfare measures by the Government for  ex-servicemen include increase in pension by 40%, disability pension for pre-mature retirees, applicability of battle causality compensation at Line of Actual Control, Line of Control and International Border, financial assistance to soldiers on their supreme sacrifice through newly created Army Battle Causalities Welfare Fund, enhancement of ex-gratia ad-hoc allowance, Special Pension to Ex-sailors and skill development training in 36 job roles to over 30,000 retiring soldiers so far.

(i)        The quantum of shares to be transacted, mode of sale and final pricing of the transaction or lay down the principles/ guidelines for such pricing; and the selection of strategic partner/ buyer; terms and conditions of sale; and

(ii)      To decide on the proposals of CGD with regard the timing, price, the terms & conditions of sale, and any other related issue to the transaction.

This will facilitate quick decision-making and obviate the need for multiple instances of approval by CCEA for the same CPSE.

                The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the construction of a 3rd railway line between Narayangarh in West Bengal & Bhadrak in Odisha of 155 kms length. At a total cost of Rs. 1,866.31 crore it is slated for completion during the year 2023-24.

The construction of the third line will help create capacity to cope with existing as well as additional traffic. The busy section between Narayangarh and Bhadrak is mainly used for the movement of coking coal to steel plants as well as the movement of export ore from the areas of Chakradharpur to several ports. Therefore, this 3rd line will help in easier movement of coal. This will help steel plants, power plants as well as the export industry, which will boost the economies of Odisha and West Bengal, and entire East India.

Third line will ease congestion on this route. Narayangarh – Bhadrak section forms a part of the Howrah-Chennai trunk route. The present utilization (with maintenance block) of the section between Narayangarh & Bhadrak is to the tune of 138% as per Line Capacity Statement 2014-15. Over and above the heavy freight traffic, the route has to accommodate 47 pairs of coaching trains including high-speed trains like Bhubaneswar Rajdhani, Howrah-Yesvantpur Duronto, Howrah-Puri Duronto, Sealdah-Puri duronto & Howrah-Puri Shatabdi Express. This makes it highly congested.

The project will also help generate direct employment for about 37.2 lakh mandays during construction, and has the potential to generate indirect employment as well.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister has approved the recommendations of Group of Ministers (GoM) constituted to examine the specific recommendations of High Level Empowered Committee (HLEC) constituted to address the issues of Stressed Thermal Power Projects.

The CCEA has approved recommendations of the GoM mainly relating to grant of linkage coal for short-term PPA, allowed existing coal linkage to be used in case of termination of PPAs due to payment default by DISCOMs, procurement of bulk power by a nodal agency against pre-declared linkages, Central/State Gencos may act as an aggregator of power, increase in quantity of coal for special forward e-auction for power sector, coal linkage auctions to be held at regular intervals, non-lapsing of short supplies of coal, ACQ to be determined based on efficiency, payment of Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) made mandatory, non-cancellation of PPA/FSA/LTOA post NCLT scenario and non-cancellation of PPA for non-compliance of COD. With the implementation of these recommendations, many of the issues affecting the Thermal Power Sector are likely to get resolved.

Background:

The Government of India constituted a High Level Empowered Committee (HLEC) under the Chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary to address the issues of stressed thermal power projects. The committee made its recommendations to resolve the stress in thermal power sector and submitted its report in Nov' 18. The report of HLEC is available on the website of Ministry of Power. The Government thereafter constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) to examine the specific recommendations of HLEC and forward its comments for consideration of the Cabinet. Subsequently GoM recommended majority of HLEC recommendations.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for extension of time and scope for revival and development of un-served and under-served air strips of State Governments, Airports Authority of India (AAI), Civil enclaves, CPSUs, helipads and water aerodromes at the total cost of Rs.4500 crore with the budgetary support of Government of India.

Impact:

As an outcome, small cities/towns shall be connected on commencement of operation of flights to under-served/un-served airports and it will further boost the economic development in these as well as surrounding areas in terms of job creation and related infrastructure development.

Details:

The Ministry has received overwhelming response from the airlines in two rounds of RCS Bidding held so far. In the first round of UDAN bidding, 128 routes were assigned to five airline operators for 43 un-served/underserved airports/airstrips on 31.03.2017. The response from airline operators have considerably improved in second round of RCS bidding wherein 86 proposals involving 325 routes were awarded to 15 selected airline operators in January, 2018.

During RCS-UDAN version 1.0 & 2.0, 66 airports were identified and 31 heliports (28 unserved heliports and 3 unserved airports). During UDAN version 3.0, to increase the tourism potential at the coastal areas, Tourism routes in coordination with Ministry of Tourism and Seaplanes for connecting Water Aerodromes were included.

Background:

Finance Minister in his Budget Speech 2016-17, inter-alia, announced making adequate provisions for revival of unserved and underserved airports. The Union Cabinet approved the proposal for revival of 50 un-served/under-served airports/airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India (AAI), Civil enclaves and Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs). The Revival of airstrips/airports will be 'demand driven', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Governments for providing various concessions as Airports will be develop without insisting on its financial viability.

India has a vast coastline of approximately 7500 km and is dotted with numerous water bodies which can be exploited for establishment of Water Aerodrome. A network of Water Aerodromes along with land based airports will improve air connectivity and be particularly useful for localized short-distance travelling. Therefore, it was decided to develop/operate Water Aerodromes in India with aviation expertise of AAI and cooperation of State Government.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for funds amounting to Rs.2790 crore towards interest subvention for extending indicative loan amount of Rs.12900 crore by banks to the sugar mills under “Scheme for extending financial assistance to sugar mills for enhancement and augmentation of ethanol production capacity” for the 268 applications/proposals, in addition to Rs.1332 crore already approved by CCEA in June, 2018.

 

CCEA has also approved Rs.565 crore towards interest subvention for extending indicative loan amount of Rs.2600 crore by banks to the molasses based standalone distilleries to augment capacity through installation of incineration boilers and other methods in the existing distilleries for achieving ZLD and additional equipment for ethanol production as well as for setting up of new standalone distilleries for ethanol production.  A separate scheme for the molasses based standalone distilleries would be formulated accordingly by Department of Food & Public Distribution.

 

In continuation of the earlier scheme approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in June, 2018 and with a view to support sugar sector and in the interest of sugarcane farmers, the CCEA chaired by the Prime Minister today approved the proposal for extending soft loans of about Rs. 15500 crores through banks to sugar mills and molasses based stand alone distilleries under the Scheme for extending financial assistance for enhancement and augmentation of ethanol production capacity for which Government  will bear further interest subvention amounting to Rs. 3355 crore for five years including moratorium period of one year.  As a result of implementation of the scheme being notified after this decision of CCEA and the earlier scheme approved by CCEA in June, 2018, the country will have sufficient capacity to divert surplus sugar during surplus phase for production of ethanol.  

 

Government has notified National Policy on Bio-fuels in year 2018 under which diversion of B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice to produce ethanol has been allowed in surplus seasons. In order to augment ethanol production capacity and thereby also allow diversion of sugar for production of ethanol, in earlier approved scheme, soft loan is being extended through banks to the sugar mills for setting up new distilleries/ expansion of existing distilleries and installation of incineration boilers or installation of any method as approved by Central Pollution Control Board for Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) for which Government had approved interest subvention of Rs. 1332 crore. In principle approval was accorded by Government for extending soft loans of about Rs. 6139 crores to 114 sugar mills under that scheme.  

 

However, in order to further enhance and augment the ethanol production capacity in the country, it has now been decided by Government to extend soft loans amounting to Rs 12900 crores to some more sugar mills for setting up new distilleries/ expansion of existing distilleries and installation of incineration boilers or installation of any method as approved by Central Pollution Control Board for Zero Liquid Discharge for which Government will bear interest subvention of Rs. 2790 crore. About 268 sugar mills are likely to be benefitted as a result of this measure.

 

Besides, to further optimize the ethanol production capacity, it has also been decided to extend soft loans amounting to Rs. 2600 crores by banks to the molasses based stand-alone distilleries to augment capacity through installation of incineration boilers and other methods in the existing distilleries for achieving ZLD and additional equipments for ethanol production as well as for setting up of new stand-alone distilleries for ethanol production for which Government  will bear interest subvention of Rs. 565 crore. 

 

This decision would further help in achieving blending target for mixing ethanol and in achieving the objectives of National Bio-Fuel Policy, 2018 and to reduce sugar inventories by diversion of B-Heavy molasses and sugarcane juice for ethanol production and thereby sacrificing sugar during surplus phase.  It will also improve liquidity of sugar mills by way of value addition to their revenues from supply of ethanol under Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme (EBP) thereby facilitating them to clear cane price dues of farmers. 

 

Benefits:

The approval of interest subvention will help in: 


	improving liquidity of sugar mills by way of value addition to their revenues from supply of ethanol under Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme (EBP);
	reducing sugar inventories and thereby facilitate timely clearance of cane price dues of farmers and
	achieving 10% blending target of EBP.

                In a first of its kind initiative, the Election Commission of India has reached out to over 150 Community Radio stations from across the country to help educate and inform the voters. The event was organised by India International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Management (IIIDEM), in partnership with Seeking Modern Applications for Real Transformation (SMART), at IIIDEM, Dwarka, New Delhi. The main purpose of the workshop was for training and capacity building of Community Radios for voter education and awareness.

In the Valedictory address, Mr. Umesh Sinha, Senior Deputy Election Commissioner, ECI said that the Community Radio is one of the best medium to reach the last voter of the country. He said that these workshops were just the beginning to a long term and sustained engagement and Community Radio can play a vital role in motivating and mobilising the voters, enlisting the underserved voters into the electoral roll, mobilising them to go to the polling booth, educating them about their rights and responsibilities, and making them an informed and educated voter. He emphasised that every voter is the first representative of the country, they are the soldiers and play an important role in protecting democracy. All voters across the country have the same power. Elections provide a level playing field as each vote has the same power, no matter who casts it –the richest of the rich or the poorest of the poor. He said that Community Radio can play an important role in strengthening democracy by developing content in their local dialects and deepening the process of voter education and awareness upto the grass root levels. He assured that Community Radio Stations will now become an integral part of the voter education programme.



The workshop was inaugurated by Mr Chandra Bhushan Kumar, Deputy Election Commissioner & DG, IIIDEM on March 25, who iterated that Community Radios can play a pivotal role in increasing voter enrolment and participation in the “Festival of Democracy“. He said that the tag line of ‘No voter to be left behind’ was to ensure that each and every eligible voter irrespective of his or her economic status, class, caste or profession understands the importance of his or her vote. He talked about the measures taken to include migrant workers, homeless, tribal persons, persons with disabilities (PWD), service voters, NRIs. He said that the effort of the Commission is to ensure fair and fearless elections and that Community Radios can play an important role in assisting Election Commission.

Ms. Archana Kapoor, Founder of SMART, said that inclusion of Community Radio stations in the campaign is also recognition of the work by ECI, being done at the grass root levels by the stations. The stations will broadcast programmes in their own dialect and will develop 5 programmes each, besides broadcasting promotional material. Ms. Kapoor assured that Community Radio station, across the country, will contribute their best for voter education.

                In continuation of the briefing held for the first batch of General, Police and Expenditure Observers held on 14th March, the Commission today conducted day long sessions for over a thousand more officers drawn from IAS, IPS, Indian Revenue Service and few other Central Services. These officers are being deployed as Observers in the forthcoming Elections to the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies of four States. 

          Addressing the participants, Chief Election Commissioner Shri Arora said that while all Observers are essentially the eyes and ears of the Commission, Senior Expenditure Observers are assuming an enormous role given the quantum of money power vitiating the election process. He added that the Commission has already appointed two Special Expenditure Observers for the States of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka.  To further identify the role of  illegitimate resources in the elections, the Commission is considering appointing few more Special Expenditure Observers in more Expenditure Sensitive States. Shri Arora reminded the Observers of their enormous responsibility to ensure fair, ethical and transparent election process in the field. He asked them to be vigilant, impartial and accessible to all stakeholders to reinforce the faith in the minds of the citizen towards the electoral process. While elucidating the myriad responsibilities of  Observers, the CEC mentioned that Electoral Rolls are the bed rock of election process and Observers need to ensure the integrity of the Electoral Rolls.

          Reminding the Observers of their crucial role , Shri Arora said that The Commission reposes complete trust in the senior officers being deputed to the field and would like the Observers & CEOs to be the first and last point of contact. However, he also cautioned them that even a trace of proven malafide or partisanship, would lead to ruthless action from the Commission. He further added that, keeping pace with the changing times, the Commission has been proactive in making the electoral process participative by involving & empowering citizens particularly through cVigil App. He said that the cVigil App initiative which started as a pilot project in the Karnataka State elections and then implemented in the five State elections held last year, has now been extended pan India for the ongoing General Elections. 

          Shri Ashok Lavasa, Election Commissioner in his address stated that the Observers have been a critical part of the election process and machinery. He advised Observers to be alert, accessible and responsive and effective in the field to ensure fairness and transparency of the election process. He urged the Observers to be familiar with all the instructions & guidelines to ensure clarity in execution in the field. He said the senior Observers need to play dual roles of monitoring and mentoring. While addressing the Expenditure Observers, Shri Lavasa stressed that only the seizure figures may not be taken as a measure of the efficacy of enforcement machinery, but the money trail and actual perpetrators behind the consignment should be investigated. 

          Welcoming the participants, Election Commissioner Shri Sushil Chandra noted that Observers play an important role for the Election Commission for robust monitoring of the complete process in the field. He asked the Observers to ensure better co-ordination amongst all the Stakeholders in the field. Elaborating the diverse challenges for the Observers in the current scenario, he urged them to be vigilant and accessible. He mentioned that developing real time intelligence and monitoring of accounts of the candidates would be crucial to downplay the role of illegitimate resources adversely influencing the election process. Comprehensive Expenditure Monitoring Handbook, Observers Manual and National Election Planner were provided to the Observers to facilitate their work. 

          During the day long sessions, detailed thematic presentations were made on Election planning, Observer’s roles and responsibilities, electoral roll issues, enforcement of Model Code of Conduct, legal provisions, EVM/VVPAT management, media engagement and the wide array of activities undertaken for voter facilitation under the Commission’s flagship SVEEP (Systematic Voter’s Education and Electoral Participation) programme to apprise the Observers. The Observers were also acquainted with the various IT initiatives and mobile applications launched by the Commission for voter facilitation as well as effective and efficient management of election process in the field. Detailed presentations were made about ‘Observer App’, cVIGIL App and other initiatives

                            The Schedule for holding general election to the 17th Lok Sabha 2019 and Legislative Assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim 2019 has been announced on 10th March, 2019.  Poll is scheduled to be held in multiple phases. Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, prohibits displaying any election matter by means, inter alia, of television or similar apparatus, during the period of 48 hours before the hour fixed for conclusion of poll in a constituency. The relevant portions of the said Section 126 are re-produced below:

(126. Prohibition of public meeting during period of forty-eight hours ending with hour fixed for conclusion ofpoll-

(1)        No person shall-

            (a).....................

(b) Display to the public any election matter by means of cinematograph, television or other similar apparatus;

            (c)........................

            In any polling area during the period of forty-eight hours ending with the   hour  fixed for the conclusion of the poll for any election in the polling area.

(2)        Any person who contravenes the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be   punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years,   or with fine, or with both.

(3)        In this Section, the expression “election mater” means any.matter intended or calculated to influence or affect the result of an election)


	During elections, there are sometimes allegations of violation of the provisions of the above Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by TV channels in the telecast of their panel discussions/debates and other news and current affairs programmes. The Commission has clarified in the past that the said Section 126 prohibits displaying any election matter by means, inter alia, of television or similar apparatus, during the period of 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for conclusion of poll in a constituency. ""Election matter"" has been defined in that Section as any matter intended or calculated to influence or affect the result of an election. Violation of the aforesaid provisions of Section 126 is punishable with imprisonment upto a period of two years, or with fine or both.



	The Commission once again reiterates that the TV/Radio channels and cable networks/internet website/social media platforms should ensure that the contents of the programmes telecast/broadcast/ displayed by them during the period of 48 hours referred to in Section 126 do not contain any material, including views/appeals by panelists/participants that may be construed as promoting/ prejudicing the prospect of any particular party or candidate(s) or influencing/ affecting the result of the election. This shall, among other things include display of any opinion poll and of standard debates, analysis, visuals and sound-bytes.



	In this connection, attention is also invited to Section 126A of the R.P. Act 1951, which prohibits conduct of Exit poll and dissemination of its results during the period mentioned therein, i.e. the hour fixed for commencement of poll in the first phase and half an hour after the time fixed for close of poll for the last phase in all the States.



	During the period not covered by Section 126, concerned TV/Radio/Cable/FM channels/internet websites/Social Media platforms are free to approach the state/ district/ local authorities for necessary permission for conducting any broadcast/Telecast related events (other than exit polls) which must also conform to the provisions of the model code of conduct, the programme code laid down by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting under the Cable Network (Regulation)  Act  with  regard to decency,  maintenance  of communal  harmony,  etc.  All Internet websites and Social Media platforms must also comply with the provisions of The Information      Technology      Act,      2000     and      ECI     guidelines No-491/SM/2013/Communication, dt 25th October,2013, for all political content on their platform. As regards political advertisement, the same needs pre-certification by the Committees set up at State/District level as per the Commission's order  No. 509/75/2004/JS-I, dt 15th April,2004. 


6.   Attention of all print media is also drawn to the following guidelines issued    by Press Council of India to follow for observance during the election:

i.   It will be the duty of the Press to give objective reports about elections and the candidates.  The newspapers are not expected to indulge in unhealthy election campaigns, exaggerated reports about any candidate/party or incident during the elections.  In practice, two or three closely contesting candidates attract all the media attention. While reporting on the actual campaign, a newspaper may not leave out any important point raised by a candidate and make an attack on his or her opponent.

ii.  Election campaign along communal or caste lines is banned under the election rules. Hence, the Press should eschew reports, which tend to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between people on the ground of religion, race, caste, community orlanguage.

iii.  The Press should refrain from publishing false or critical statements in regard to the personal character and conduct of any candidate or in relation to the candidature or withdrawal of any candidate or his candidature, to prejudice the prospects of that candidate in the elections. The Press shall not publish unverified allegations against any candidate/party.

iv. The Press shall not accept any kind of inducement, financial or otherwise, to project a candidate/party. It shall not accept hospitality or other facilities offered to them by or on behalf of any candidate/party.

v.   The Press is not expected to indulge in canvassing of a particular candidate/party. If it does, it shall allow the right of reply to the other candidate/party.

vi. The Press shall not accept/publish any advertisement at the cost of public exchequer regarding achievements of a party/ governmentin power.

vii.  The Press shall observe all the directions/ orders/instructions of the Election Commission/Returning Officers or Chief Electoral Officer issued  from time to time.

 

7.         Attention of the electronic media is invited to the ""Guidelines for Election  Broadcasts"" issued by NBSA dt 3rd March, 2014.

 

i.  News broadcasters should endeavour to inform the public in an objective manner, about relevant electoral matters, political parties, candidates, campaign issues and voting processes as per rules and regulations laid down under The Representation of the People Act 1951 and by the Election Commission of India.

ii.   News channels shall disclose any political affiliations, either towards a party or candidate. Unless they publicly endorse or support a particular party or candidate, news broadcasters have a duty to be balanced and impartial, especially in their election reporting.

iii. News broadcasters must endeavour to avoid all forms of rumor, baseless speculation and disinformation, particularly when these concern specific political parties or candidates. Any candidate/political party, which has been     defamed or is a victim of misrepresentation, misinformation or other similar  injury  by broadcast of information should be afforded prompt correction,  and where appropriate granted an opportunity of reply.

iv.    News broadcasters must resist all political and financial pressures which may affect coverage of elections and election related matters.

v.    News broadcasters should maintain a clear distinction between editorial and expert opinion carried on their news channels.

vi.    News broadcasters that use video feed from political parties should disclose  it and appropriately tagged.

vii. Special care must be taken to ensure that every element of news/ programmes dealing with elections and election related matters is accurate on all facts relating to events, dates, places and quotes. If by mistake or inadvertence any inaccurate information is broadcast, the broadcaster must  correct it as soon as it comes to the broadcaster's notice with the same  prominence as was given to the original broadcast.

viii.     News broadcasters, their journalists and officials must not accept any money, or valuable gifts, or any favour that could influence or appear to  influence, create a conflict of interest or damage the credibility of the broadcaster or their personnel.

ix. News broadcasters must  not  broadcast  any  form  of  'hate  speech' or  other obnoxious content  that may lead  to incitement  of violence or      promote public unrest or disorder as election campaigning based  on   communal or caste factors is prohibited under Election Rules. News   broadcasters should strictly avoid reports which tend to promote feelings of  enmity or hatred among people, on the ground of religion, race, caste, community, region or language.

x.         News broadcasters are required to scrupulously maintain a distinction  between news and paid content.  All paid content should be clearly marked   as ""Paid Advertisement"" or ""Paid Content”: and paid content must be  carried in compliance with the ""Norms & Guidelines on Paid News"" dated  24.11.2011 issued by NBA.

xi  Special care must be taken to report opinion polls accurately and fairly, by disclosing to viewers as to who commissioned, conducted and paid for the conduct of the opinion polls and the broadcast. If a news broadcaster  carries the results of an opinion poll or other election projection, it must   also explain the context, and the  scope and limits of such polls with their limitations. Broadcast of opinion polls should be accompanied by  information to assist viewers to understand the poll's significance, such as the methodology used, the sample size, the margin of error, the fieldwork dates, and data used. Broadcasters should also disclose how vote shares  are converted to seat shares.

xii.       The broadcasters shall not broadcast any ""election matter"" i.e. any matter intended or calculated to influence or affect the result of an election, durin  the 48 hours ending with the hours fixed for the conclusion of poll in  violation of Section     126(1)(b) of  the Representation of the People Act1951.

xiii.      The Election Commission of India (ECI) will monitor the broadcasts made by news broadcasters from the time elections are announced until the conclusion and announcement of election results. Any violation by  member broadcasters  reported to the News Broadcasting Standards   Authority  (NBSA) by the Election Commission will be dealt with by the NBSA under  its regulations.

xiv.      Broadcasters should, to the extent possible, carry voter education programmes to effectively inform voters about the voting process,  the  importance of voting, including how, when and where to vote, to register to   vote and the secrecy of theballot.

xv.   News broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India,     unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.

 

8.       Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) has also developed a “Voluntary Code of Ethics” for all the participating social media platforms to ensure free, fair & ethical usage of their platforms to maintain integrity of electoral process during the general elections to the Lok Sabha 2019 and Legislative Assemblies of four states and the bye-elections being held simultaneously. Attention of all concerned Social Media platforms is invited to the following text of “Voluntary Code of Ethics” dt 20th March, 2019:

Chief Election Commissioner Shri Sunil Arora while appreciating the steps taken, said that formulation of the Code augurs a good beginning but is essentially, a work in making.  He said the Participants need to follow in letter and spirit the commitments made in the Code of Ethics. The Platforms have committed to process any violations reported under Section 126 of RP Act, 1951 within three hours as per Sinha Committee recommendations.  

The Platforms have also agreed to create a high priority dedicated reporting mechanism for the ECI and appoint dedicated teams during the period of General Elections for taking expeditious action on any reported violations. Participants have also agreed to provide a mechanism for political advertisers to submit pre-certified advertisements issued by Media Certification and Monitoring Committee. The Code of Ethics also promises to facilitate transparency in paid political advertisements. IAMAI has agreed to coordinate with participants various steps mentioned in this code. Participants have also committed to voluntarily undertake voter awareness campaigns.

 The ‘Code of Ethics” has been developed to ensure free, fair & ethical usage of Social Media Platforms to maintain the integrity of the electoral process for the General Elections 2019. The Code voluntarily agreed upon by the Participants comes into operation with immediate effect.

            The text of the Code is linked below.

                Election Commission of India today had in-depth interactive session with representatives of various Social Media Platforms and Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) on the usage of Social Media ahead of the Lok Sabha Elections 2019.

            In his opening remarks, Chief Election Commissioner Shri Sunil Arora cited Model Code of Conduct as a unique and historic document which is followed by all political parties /entities from the date of declaration of schedule of elections till the election process is concluded. This Code is the outcome of consensus evolved amongst the different Political Parties and ECI. Infact, more often than not, this Code has obviated the need for application of more stringent provisions of law, he said. Shri Arora exhorted the Social Media Organizations, who are formidable force-multipliers, to come up with a similar Code for the ongoing election process in the immediate context and a lasting document in the long run. 

            Election Commissioner Shri Ashok Lavasa pointed out that today's has been a momentous meeting for evolution of ‘behaviour’ of Social Media platforms on Social Media. He said that voluntary restraint is a hallmark of civilized society and works as effectively as any regulation. He suggested that a clear clause on users' voluntarily agreeing not to misuse social media platforms for election or political purposes should be considered by the management.

            Election Commissioner Shri Sushil Chandra reminded the representatives that Election Commission of India is committed to ethical, free & fair elections. He reiterated that role of social media in helping spread information as well as curbing misinformation cannot be underestimated. He added that deterrents like some punitive action against users misusing the platform should be considered pro-actively. Shri Chandra said that a participative approach from the social media platforms would greatly help ECI meet its objectives. 

            The meeting was centered on discussing issues like appointment of dedicated grievance channel for expeditious action by the organizations, pre- certification and transparency in expenditure of political advertisements. The meeting also focused on evolving a notification mechanism by social media platforms for acting upon the violations of Section 126 of R.P. Act, 1951 and preventing misuse of these platforms. 

            Today's meeting was attended by the industry head Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and representatives from social media organizations such as Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Google, ShareChat, TikTok and BigoTV.

            IAMAI and Social Media intermediaries willingly agreed to come up with a ‘Code of Ethics’ for the Industry laying down operational details by tomorrow evening.

                The Election Commission of India headed by Chief Election Commissioner  Shri Sunil Arora along with Election Commissioners Shri Ashok Lavasa and Shri Sushil Chandra today held a meeting of Multi Departmental Committee on Election Intelligence.  Heads of Tax Boards, Law enforcement agencies, Central Paramilitary Forces and representatives of Financial Institutions attended the meeting.

Addressing the meeting, Chief Election Commissioner Shri Arora said it is the constitutional mandate of the Election Commission of India to conduct free and fair elections. Conducting clean elections is now one of the biggest challenges in our democracy given the prevalent abuse of money power, particularly when it manifests in inducement of voters.  He said Commission is determined to curb this menace and has issued  detailed guidelines to monitor election expenditure incurred by candidates and political parties.  The expenditure monitoring mechanism has got stronger over a period of time and larger seizures have been made by our enforcement teams in successive elections. He said individually and collectively the agencies participating in the meeting are the bulwarks of clean elections. The outcome of synergised action should exceed the commitments made. 

Election Commissioner Shri Lavasa pointed out that the implementation on the field, of instructions of the Commission requires co-ordination among the various expenditure monitoring teams and the agencies tasked with enforcement.  Sharing of Intelligence amongst the agencies should ensure that there is concerted attack on problems faced. He noted that multidimensional, multi-fanged crime needs to be tackled with coordinated action. He reminded the agencies that due follow-up action on seizures done in previous MCC phase should see demonstrative action against antisocial elements enough to feel deterred next time. He emphasised that mischief mongers are ever devising more ingenious ways to beat the system.

Election Commissioner Shri Chandra highlighted that election expenditure monitoring mechanism with its two thrust areas of keeping track of the legal expenditure incurred by candidates and political parties for election campaigns, and more importantly, ensuring that there is no illegal use of money and other items for buying of votes, is vital to ensure clean elections. Use of money during the elections has increased by leaps and bounds in recent times and therefore there is greater need to have synergy amongst various enforcement agencies so that a collective strategy is developed to fight this menace.  The Commission desires that all enforcement agencies should have proper sharing of information for taking coordinated action rather than working in silos.

The issues discussed at the meeting included ways of Curbing of covert expenditure by candidates and political parties; sensitisation of the law enforcement agencies about their role during elections; co-operation and sharing of intelligence of economic offences amongst law enforcement agencies for effective action; preparation of road map for action during the elections; mapping of constituencies by concerned agencies to check transportation of smuggled goods, drugs, liquor and cash, including fake currency, through seaports, inter-state borders and international borders and pro-active and preventive action by each law enforcement agency. The Heads of Tax Boards, Law enforcement agencies, Central Paramilitary Forces and representatives of Financial Institutions assured the Commission of prompt 24X7 expenditure monitoring and surveillance action and implementation of instructions to ensure curbing of abuse of money power in elections.

The senior Officers who attended the meeting included Shri P.C. Mody, Chairperson & Member (Inv.), CBDT; Shri Pranab Kumar Das, Chairman, CBIC; Shri Sanjay Kumar Mishra, IRS, Director, Enforcement  Directorate; Smt. Mitali Madhusmita, IRS, DG, CEIB; Shri Pankaj Kumar Mishra, IRS, Director, Financial Intelligence Unit-IND; Sh. Rajesh Ranjan, IPS,DG, CISF; Shri Rajni Kant Mishra, IPS, DG, BSF; Shri Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar, IPS, DG, CRPF; Shri Kumar Rajesh Chandra, IPS, DG, SSB; Shri Abhay, IPS, DG, NCB; Shri Arun Kumar, IPS, DG, RPF; Shri Sunil Mehta, Chairman, Indian Bank Association; Shri Rakesh Asthana, IPS, DG, BCAS; Sr. Level  Functionary from the RBI.

                As a run up to the forthcoming Elections to the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies to four States, the Election Commission of India today organized the 1st Briefing for Observers to be deployed in the Poll going States. Over 1800 senior officers drawn from IAS, IPS officers as also from Indian Revenue Service and few other Central Services attended the briefing meeting. These officers are being deployed as General, Police and Expenditure Observers.

Reminding the Observers of their crucial role, the Chief Election Commissioner Sh Sunil Arora pointed out that the officers need to be earnest and have no choice but to ensure that no mistakes are committed. Sh Arora recalled that in the recent State elections held, it took all of miniscule percentages of instances of slippages in following the laid down protocol for EVM-VVPAT procedures or missing out of few names from Electoral Roll, or delay in Counting of votes, rendering all other good work done in the background. He reminded the officers that ECI, set up as a unique institution since 1950 to function as the very bedrock of democratic process, associates officers from varied fields to help conduct the elections as per well defined duties. CEC emphasised that while discharging the onerous duties as Observers while officers observe the electoral process, the ECI observes these officers to ensure that they sincerely discharge the assigned duties. Sh Arora noted that with changed times, concerns about abuse of money power and also social media are posing newer challenges.  He said the endeavour of ECI is not only to conduct free and fair elections but also transparent, clean and ethical elections.

Election Commissioner Sh Ashok Lavasa reminded the group that as Observers, they need to ensure implementation of all instructions of the ECI in letter and spirit. Sh Lavasa mentioned that the recently launched CVigil App has helped empower every citizen also to help the Commission keep a vigilant eye out for Model Code violations. But availability of this App has itself put more responsibility  on officers managing and overseeing the electoral system. He reiterated that the Observers need to be accessible and available to all stakeholders on the ground as the officers are literally the extended arms of ECI in the field.

Addressing the officers, Election Commissioner Sh Sushil Chandra drew the attention of the Officers that as Observers their role is to be eyes and ears of the Commission in keeping a watchful eye and to take all preventive measures to ensure free and fair elections.. He pointed out that the role of Expenditure Observers becomes crucial when methods of inducements to voters are becoming very innovative too.

During the day long briefing sessions, the officers were given comprehensive and thorough inputs about the various aspects of election management by the Senior Deputy Election Commissioner, DECs and DGs of ECI. Detailed thematic presentations were made on Election planning, Observer’s roles and responsibilities, electoral roll issues, enforcement of Model Code of Conduct, legal provisions, EVM/VVPAT management, media engagement and the wide array of activities undertaken for voter facilitation under the Commission’s flagship SVEEP (Systematic Voter’s Education and Electoral Participation) programme. The Observers were also acquainted with the various IT initiatives and mobile applications launched by the Commission for voter facilitation as well as effective and efficient management of election process in the field. The Observers were provided functional demonstration of EVMs and VVPATs and briefed about the multifarious technical security features, administrative protocols and procedural safeguards that surround the EVM ecosystem to make it completely secure, robust, reliable, non-tamperable and credible.

Comprehensive publications unveiled by the Commission, namely compilation of all thematic presentations on different subjects of Election Management, State/UT profiles and National Election Planner and Compendium of Instructions on Election Expenditure Monitoring were provided to the Observers to facilitate their work.

ECI for the first time has also started a  new mobile app called ‘Observer App’. Using this App, General, Police and Expenditure observers can submit their Observer's report securely to ECI  to upload the relevant document from the mobile app. The Observers will get all important notifications, alerts, and urgent messages on this App while they are on duty. It will also facilitate observers to get their deployment status, download the ID card and update their profile. Since the observers will be closely involved in real-time disposal of the cVIGIL Model code and expenditure violation cases, this App would help see all the cVIGIL cases under their jurisdiction. The Observers can make a written observation after the flying squads have investigated the matter. Observers are put on deputation with ECI for the entire duration of the election process.

                Following are the highlights of the speech of Shri N.K. Singh, Chairman, 15th  Finance Commission, at the launch of the book “Indian Fiscal Federalism” written by Dr. Y. V. Reddy, former Governor of RBI and Chairman of the 14th  Finance Commission of India alongwith Dr. G. R. Reddy, Advisor (Finance) to the Government of Telangana:

    I agree with him that Fiscal Federalism is a dynamic process so to say ‘a Work in  Motion.’

            (Page 12) “It is useful to note that the Finance Commission as envisaged in the Constitution does not prohibit its continuous functioning except that it has to be re-constituted before the expiry of every 5 years.”   There is a need for recourse mechanism for mid-term correction, similar to Australian Model of continuous Grants Commission ‘state relativities’ are revisited every years based on latest available data.  If macro parameters go along should the tyranny of the Finance Commission be inflicted on the States for 5 years before any relief can be corrected?  After all, all awards of the Finance Commission are based on realistic assumptions on what is acceptable macro-economic model in terms of key parameters like revenue projections, State GDP growth, permissible expenditure growth etc.  Indeed in our visits to many States we did encounter that in some States the revenue projections were unrealistic, the expenditure suppression was unacceptable and the State GDP numbers look quite misaligned.  So what is the recourse mechanism for States or Union may have in case it is found that in the vertical devolution there are also lacunae of one kind or another. Should that wait for a 5 year correction or should there be midterm recourse.

            (Page 13) “There were also serious concerns about the role of the Planning Commissions in governance at the Union level and in Union-State Relations. There were apprehensions that it would be an extra Constitutional authority. Some felt that any financial transfer outside the Finance Commission was not envisaged in the Constitution.” 

            Indeed on Page 14 in the book para 4 last line it says “ from the 4th Finance Commission the TOR in the presidential order appointing the Commission excluded the consideration of the Plan requirements of the State by the Finance Commission, and the Planning Commission became an important parallel channel of transfers.”  Several Finance Commissions in the past have lamented at their constitutional role being circumscribed in being excluded from the consideration of the Plan requirements.  Now that the Planning Commission does not exist and this remorse cannot be expressed what is the institutional mechanism which can make up the lament of the past.  This inhibition of the Finance Commission in the plan requirements of the States does not exist anymore, particularly since the NITI Aayog itself, in the words of the authors at page 16, has more of an advisory mandate.  Altering the role of the NITI Aayog, policy makers would be mindful of the need of not to create a Planning Commission version 2.0 since it was a conscious decision not to accord resource allocation powers to NITI Aayog. Should one not be careful of creating another parallel financial transfer mechanism?

The Original Sin

The 7th schedule of the Constitution based on Art 246 of the Constitution clearly lays down the subjects for the Union List, the concurrent list and the State List with the exception that each will respect so to say the territorial limits of the other. The authors on page 22 have an interesting section entitled “Era of entitlement–based central legislations”. The examples given are the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009 and the National Food Security Act 2013.  How do these stand-alone entitlement legislations mesh with the 7th schedule of the Constitution and transgress the borders? And how could that none of the  States, much less those with domain knowledge, did not oppose at the transgression of these limits?  The authors correctly pointed also on para 2 of page 76 that “Over the years there has been an enlargement of the Concurrent List and the Centre’s spending on State Subjects presumably on the grounds that such expenditure will serve national priorities better.”

 

The autonomy of the State, if one were to use that expression, was severely circumscribed the moment they become a party to and indeed voted for the constitutional amendments enlarging not only the Concurrent List but enlargement in the Central government spending on State governments subject has correctly pointed out by the authors.    This has also complicated the drawing board immensely  as one looks at the overall picture.  

In dealing with the policy space for the Union and the States on page 76 of the book the authors observed that the transfers through the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) impose heavy burden on the State governments.  First through the sharing pattern, second  on schemes where they have to readjust or adapt their own schemes with conditions imposed by the Central government and third, by forcing to modify or roll them back because of resource concerns.  “Above all, despite using the  State administrative machinery and contributing to the schemes while accepting the priorities of the Centre, the credit for the whole programme is taken by the Government of India.”  

Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were first initiated even before the First Plan started and during the period of interim Finance Commission by giving central grants for a scheme like Grow More Food Scheme. In the First Five Year plan, many schemes in the states’ domain were funded through central grants like Damodar Valley, Bhakra Nangal, many community development projects, minor irrigation schemes etc. And so to say this was the original sin in which the forbidden fruit was consumed by both the Center and States and there is no redemption thereafter.  The authors correctly point out concerns on page 77 that “the most sensitive part of Centre-State fiscal relations is mainly the area of transfers outside the Finance Commission that is implicitly available to the Centre. The States feel that the magnitude of the transfer are large; their inter-state distribution is discretionary, arbitrary, and regressive; the transfers create multiplier responsibilities on them; that they distort the designs of the State schemes even if the later are better and more advanced; and above all, the entire credit is taken by the Central Government, whereas the schemes are jointly funded and implementation is done exclusively by the States.”  What is the basis of the perpetuation of this original sin? The Central Government does not even transfer the subjects related to the CSS to the Concurrent list or have individual standalone legislations  instead securing parliamentary power. 

 

Catch-22 between Art. 282 and Seventh Schedule

 

Note the Article 282 of the constitution which says  “The Union or a State may make any grants for any public purpose, notwithstanding that the purpose is not one with respect to which Parliament or the Legislature of the State, as the case may be, may make laws.”

Originally in the Constitution, it was not expected to be an overarching provision but an extra-ordinary one to be used very sparingly used.  And If I quote Shri K Santhanam, Chairman of the 2nd Finance Commission on Article 282, he said- “This was not intended to be one of the major provisions for making readjustments between the Union and the States, if that was the idea, then there was no purpose in evolving such a complicated set of relations of shares, assignments and grants. There is no purpose in having two Articles enabling the Center to assist the states-one through the Finance Commission and the other by more executive discretion. In the latter case, even parliamentary legislation is not needed. Of course, it will have to be included in the Budget. But, beyond being an item in the Budget, no further sanction need to be taken. Therefore, in my view, this Article was a residuary a reserve Article to enable the Union to deal with unforeseen contingencies. That was how this Article was used both by the British Government and, after transfer of power, before the first year of the First Five Year Plan. Under this Article, only some grow-more-food grants and some rehabilitation grants were given.”

And N A Palkhivala, Constitutional expert, in his opinion given to 9th Finance Commission, opined- ”Art.282 is not intended to enable the Union to make such grants as fall properly under Art. 275. Art. 282 embodies merely a residuary power which enables the Union or a State to make any grant for any purpose, irrespective of the question whether the purpose is one over which the grantor has legislative power.”

For how long the misuse of the Article 282, totally outside the frames of the constitution, will continue to exist? This is the core question that creates dichotomy in the functions of the Finance Commission as envisaged in Article 280. How is this contradiction to be resolved?  This requires wider debate. 

 

Triumph of Experience over Expectations

 

Finally a final comment is about the Triumph of Experience over Expectations.  While justifying the 42% devolution recommended by the 14th Finance Commission on page 74 of the book the authors very correctly point out that tax devolutions of 42% recommended by the 14th Finance Commission is not comparable with devolution of 32% recommended by its immediate predecessor. The tax devolution the Commission recommended subsumed normal plan assistance, special plan assistance, special central assistance and also state-specific grants.  In addition it did not recommend any sector-specific grants.  In almost every state which we visited there was complaint by the States that in some ways funding mechanism to give back what they thought as lost money have been subsumed under the award of the Finance Commission.  Going beyond this the rationalisation of the CSS and circumscribing the transfers outside the formal mechanism by recourse of Act 282 also remain more or less where it was prior to abolition of Planning Commission.  The experience seem to have triumphed over expectations.  

 

As we go forward there is a Chapter in this book pertaining to the Fifteenth Finance Commission and I must make one or two observations.  This chapter analyses in detail the wording of the Terms of Reference of the Fifteenth Finance Commission and is problematic in several ways and that the wording seem to be just predilection in favour of the Union and gives us sound advice in its concluding paragraphs that going by the stand taken by the previous Finance Commissions, the XV Finance Commission is not bound by all the conditions listed out in the TOR.  Hoping “that it would have the courage and wisdom to be guided by the letter and spirit of the Constitutional provisions in discharging its responsibilities and upholding the sanctity of the institution.”

 

 I do not wish to comment too much on this except to say that it is the President’s prerogative to determine  both the wording and the context of the TOR assigned to the Commission.  And it is the prerogative of the Commission to address them in a manner that it considers appropriate.  The Commission is not obliged to agree but the Commission is obliged to address the specific reference which have been made to it.  In doing so we are inherently bound by past precedence and the contours of our constitutional obligations.  

Never too Late

I think Article 282 of the Constitution needs to be circumscribed and prescribed some conditions which can be invoked for undertaking schemes and measures which can undercut the basic functioning of the transfer mechanism through the Finance Commission.  Indeed, in the history of the Finance Commission, the extra constitutional comfort of the Planning Commission in undertaking several of these transfers by recourse of art 282 is part of this original sin.  We do not have a way forward.

 

There are one or two other areas which the book has referred to where it is so to say, functionally work is in progress, namely in the terms of Cesses & surcharges becoming a disproportionate proportion of the overall divisible revenue, non-tax revenues being kept outside the divisible pool.  These are no doubt worrisome issues because I too agree that there should be some mechanism to ensure that the basic spirit of the devolution process should not be undercut by clever financial engineering or taking recourse to traditions which makes them technical and legally tenable but perhaps morally not so.

 

I also like to draw the attention to the consolidated fiscal roadmap for Centre  and States where we have entered the era of competitive fiscal profligacy by use of Art. 282 by both Centre and states. However, rules of the game should be same for both. For state government liabilities, Article 293 (3) provides a constitutional check over borrowings. But there are no such restriction on the Centre. I feel that it is time we have an alternative institutional mechanism like Fiscal Council to enforce fiscal rules and keep a check on Centre’s fiscal consolidation.”

                The following is the text of this speech of Shri N.K. Singh, Chairman, Fifteenth Finance Commission at the 2nd International Workshop on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, being organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in New Delhi:

“It is indeed an honour and privilege that the National Disaster Management Authority  has asked me to address the inaugural session of the International Workshop on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. I consider it an event of great significance and interest, both personally and professionally.

 

I can claim a close association with economic policy-making in India for the last three decades. During this period, I have seen India’s economic transformation from a country struggling with its sluggish growth to one of the fastest growing economies in the world, an economy which is vibrant, competitive, and open. We now confidently engage with the world, participate in global negotiations on a wide range of issues, and seek to influence important development frameworks. The initiative of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure clearly reflects India’s commitment to address a key priority through a partnership with so many countries, international agencies, and eminent knowledge institutions. I derive a huge personal satisfaction when I see India change from just a recipient of external assistance to a country which confidently identifies strands of risks and suggests long-term solutions in a multilateral setting.  

I see this initiative as very timely and relevant for several reasons. First, as several speakers here have pointed out, there will be a spurt in investment in infrastructure sector across the countries, requiring trillions of dollars in investment. When I visit various states in India, I clearly see a determination on the part of state and urban governments to not just increase the extent of infrastructure, but also improve its quality and service. These improvements cannot be brought unless we lay down internationally accepted standards and regulations and enforce them. Second, as we have seen in recent years, these investments require credible public-private partnerships, based on a framework of judicious risk allocation and accountability. These partnerships would work much better if we can set up risk pools to deal with various kinds of risks. Third, we also struggle with increasing demands from the states for enhanced allocations for recovery and reconstruction, when disasters batter their infrastructure. We need policies and measures which reduce such losses and improve the quality of infrastructure recovery.  I look upon the Coalition as a much-needed initiative to engage closely with improved quality, standards and regulations, and the need for long-term recovery in infrastructure sector.  

India has seen a rapid expansion of the insurance sector. Such an expansion can be attributed to policies which supported opening of insurance sector to foreign direct investment, improving the supply side, and a change in the structure of Indian economy and employment, which is gradually becoming more formal, thus improving the demand side. The 2018 Economic Survey clearly points to increased insurance penetration in India, though it still needs to be improved further. The Coalition clearly makes a strong case for increased insurance coverage, particularly for infrastructure sector. I am very hopeful that the activities supported by the Coalition will pave the way for setting up large risk pools for infrastructure assets. We need to set up these pools at the national level, and then seek access to global reinsurance pools.

The word resilience finds a great resonance these days. We need to be a more resilient economy and society, which to me is not just about recovering and bouncing back, but equally about strengthening the pillars of our finance and economy. The term ‘resilience’ thus has both an external and internal dimension. So, when we speak of infrastructure resilience, we need to apply a broader meaning and context. We need to support a system-wide resilience, which includes improving our databases, conducting risk assessments, improving standards and regulations, and calibrating our risks through insurance and risk pools. When we address these key priorities through a well-defined initiative such as the Coalition, we speak directly to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, Climate Change action and Sendai framework. 

I can assure you that within the Finance Commission, we are deliberating these issues with a great sense of earnestness and commitment. Formally assigned the task through the Ministry of Finance, we are looking at all the constituents of resilience, thus diversifying the discipline of disaster management and allocating resources on the basis of a matrix of risk and vulnerability. We are equally concerned about an asset maintenance framework so that our enormous public investments in infrastructure deliver long-term results in terms of better service, longer life-span, and lower maintenance costs. 

We therefore have a convergence of objectives in promoting the Coalition. It provides a unique intersection—infrastructure, standards and regulations, resilience and sustainability, which also brings a great cast of external partners and collaborators. With two key national institutions—the Finance Commission and Niti Ayog—appropriately represented in this inaugural session here, we can assure the Coalition of the fullest expression of our support. We congratulate Dr. P.K. Mishra and Mr. Kamal Kishore, who have guided this initiative with such vision and savvy and wish the NDMA and all the partners here the very best for such a far-reaching global initiative.”

                Union Minister of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh has congratulated women on the occasion of International Women's Day. He has said that the efforts of the government will certainly prove to be effective in strengthening the participation of women and their empowerment in agriculture. He said that in order to bring women in the agriculture mainstream, the government has allocated more than 30% funds for women under various major schemes / programs and development related activities. Also, women based activities have been started to reach the benefits of different beneficiary-oriented programs / schemes and missions to women. 

The Minister said that the participation of women in the decision-making bodies at the state, district and block level under the ATMA scheme have ensured their involvement in the planning process. Along with this, changes in reporting performas have been made to maintain the statistics of benefits reaching women. A book showing the norm of fixed aid for women farmers is also being published. A National Gender Resource Centre in Agriculture has developed a women sensitization module to bring about change in the mindset and behaviour of male program operators. In the team of committed extension personnel under the revised ATMA scheme in 2014, the position of a women coordinator in every state was also created.

The Minister informed that in order to support the food security groups of the women farmers' at the domestic and household level,  financial assistance of 2 groups / per block and Rs 10,000 per group / per year is being given under the amended ATMA scheme 2014-15. In addition to these efforts, special emphasis is being given to women development activities to ensure their participation in the economic and social upliftment in the field of cooperatives. Regular cooperative education programs of women are being organized by the National Cooperative Union of India through the State Cooperative Societies. As a result of these efforts, during 2017-18, 31.47 lakh women have been benefitted by training from the NCUI in the field of cooperatives. Similarly, 6.07 lakh and 7000 women have benefited through KVKs and skill training respectively. A total of 8.62 lakh women have benefitted in 2017-18. 

Shri Singh informed that in order to facilitate women's participation in agriculture, women farmer empowerment projects under the National Rural Livelihood Mission have benefitted more than 34 lakh  women through 82 projects across 22 states and one Union Territory. In addition, appointment of one women scientist has been made mandatory in 668 KVKs established across the country. Apart from this, it was decided in 2016 that every year 15th October will be celebrated as ""Rashtriya Mahila Kisan Diwas"" by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare.

The Minister further said that in order to make women more empowered in the agriculture and allied sectors and to increase their access to land, credit and other facilities, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, in the National Agricultural Policy for Farmers has made several provisions like giving joint lease on both domestic and agricultural land. Alongside this, provisions like issuing Kisan Credit Cards, creating livelihood opportunities through crop-livestock practices, agro-processing etc. are part of the agricultural policy.

                The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), under Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, today put out list of 390 anti-cancer non-scheduled medicines with MRP reduction up to 87%.  The revised prices would come into effect from 8th March, 2019.

On27th February, 2019, NPPA had put 42 anti-cancer drugs under 30% Trade Margin cap.  Manufacturers and Hospitals were directed to convey revised MRP, to be effective from 8th March, 2019, based on the Trade Margin (TM) formula.  390 brands i.e. 91% of the 426 brands reported by manufacturers, showed downward price movement.

The average out of pocket expenditure for cancer patients is 2.5 times that for other diseases.This move is expected to benefit 22 lakh cancer patients in the countryand would result in annual savings of approx. Rs. 800 crores to the consumers. 

The Trade Margin rationalisation for 42 anti cancer drugs was rolled out as Proof of Concept, stressing on the new paradigm of self-regulation by the Industry.  The manufacturers of these 42 drugs have been directed not to reduce production volumes of brands under regulation. 

The range of reduction is as below: -

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved proposal of Airports Authority of India (AAI) for surrendering encroached AAI’s land measuring 106.76 acres situated at Gandhi Nagar, Bhopal to the State Government of Madhya Pradesh (M.P). It is in lieu of 96.56 acres of land already handed over by the Government of M.P. The remaining 10.20 acres (approx..) of land will be handed over by the Government of M.P. to A.A.I.

 

Benefits:

          In lieu of AAI’s 106.76 acres encroached land, the Government of M.P. has agreed to provide land measuring 96.56 acres approx. which is contiguous to the existing land of Bhopal Airport and can be utilized by AAI for aviation purposes. This will help in freeing up AAI’s land measuring 106.76 acres which is already being utilized by the State Government of M.P. for various purposes i.e. establishment of Government Offices, public amenities services, and for rehabilitation of migrated Sindhi families. In lieu of this land, as of now, the State Government has agreed to provide 96.56 acres of land, contiguous to Bhopal Airport, to AAI, for aviation purposes.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for extension of time and scope for revival and development of un-served and under-served air strips of State Governments, Airports Authority of India (AAI), Civil enclaves, CPSUs, helipads and water aerodromes at the total cost of Rs.4500 crore with the budgetary support of Government of India.

Impact:

As an outcome, small cities/towns shall be connected on commencement of operation of flights to under-served/un-served airports and it will further boost the economic development in these as well as surrounding areas in terms of job creation and related infrastructure development.

Details:

The Ministry has received overwhelming response from the airlines in two rounds of RCS Bidding held so far. In the first round of UDAN bidding, 128 routes were assigned to five airline operators for 43 un-served/underserved airports/airstrips on 31.03.2017. The response from airline operators have considerably improved in second round of RCS bidding wherein 86 proposals involving 325 routes were awarded to 15 selected airline operators in January, 2018.

During RCS-UDAN version 1.0 & 2.0, 66 airports were identified and 31 heliports (28 unserved heliports and 3 unserved airports). During UDAN version 3.0, to increase the tourism potential at the coastal areas, Tourism routes in coordination with Ministry of Tourism and Seaplanes for connecting Water Aerodromes were included.

Background:

Finance Minister in his Budget Speech 2016-17, inter-alia, announced making adequate provisions for revival of unserved and underserved airports. The Union Cabinet approved the proposal for revival of 50 un-served/under-served airports/airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India (AAI), Civil enclaves and Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs). The Revival of airstrips/airports will be 'demand driven', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Governments for providing various concessions as Airports will be develop without insisting on its financial viability.

India has a vast coastline of approximately 7500 km and is dotted with numerous water bodies which can be exploited for establishment of Water Aerodrome. A network of Water Aerodromes along with land based airports will improve air connectivity and be particularly useful for localized short-distance travelling. Therefore, it was decided to develop/operate Water Aerodromes in India with aviation expertise of AAI and cooperation of State Government.

Highlights of Achievements & Initiatives of Ministry of Railways:-

In the past five years, the Government has made safety the foremost priority of Indian Railways. Indian Railways has achieved its best ever safety record in 2018-19 - there has been 81% drop in number of deaths from 152 in 2013-14 to 29 this year (upto Jan 31, 2019). This is a result of holistic efforts. All Unmanned Level Crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge network have been eliminated. Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) fund of Rs. 1 lakh cr has been created for safety expenditure.

 

Laying the foundations of infrastructure for a New India, there has been a quantum leap in capital expenditure. Total capital expenditure between 2014-19 is Rs. 5.1 lakh crore which is more than double of total expenditure during 2009-14. Railways is connecting India at a faster pace with a 59% increase in the average pace of commissioning New Line / Doubling / 3rd & 4th line projects from 4.1 Kms during 2009-14 per day to 6.53 Kms per day during 2014-18.

 

Aspirations of the people of North East were fulfilled with completion of 4.94 Kms long Bogibeel Bridge, longest rail-cum-road bridge in India. Now, journey from Itanagar to Dibrugarh is only 180 Kms, reducing the travel time from 24 hrs to only 5 hrs

 

Commuter travel in urban India has been given sufficient attention. Bangalore Suburban System is being developed with ongoing projects worth more than Rs. 15,700 cr. This will benefit about 15  lakh commuters. Mumbai Suburban Systems is also being modernised with ongoing projects worth more than Rs. 70,000 cr, which will benefit about 75 lakh commuters.

 

India entered a new era of mobility with Vande Bharat Express - India's first high-tech, energy-efficient, self-propelled train. This is a prime example of the success of Make in India movement. This train will be proliferated across India and also exported globally.

 

The Ahmedabad-Mumbai High-speed Rail (HSR) will revolutionise the transport sector in India through speed, safety and service. Besides the Make in India benefits from the HSR project, Railways is creating large scale employment and economic development through sanctioned projects in Latur, Maharashtra; New Bongaigaon, Assam; Lumding, Assam;  Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh and Sonipat, Haryana. Setting records for Indian Railways, Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh has successfully executed world’s 1st ever conversion of diesel locos into electric loco to enable Mission Electrification.

 

Railways has embarked on transitioning to sustainable rail transport with a six times increase in electrification from 610 RKM during 2013-14 to 4,087 RKM during 2017-18. 100% Electrification of Broad Gauge Routes of Indian Railways is targeted by 2021-22.

 

Railways has achieved significant milestones in moving the country’s economy faster with the highest ever freight loading in 2018-19. Freight earnings have touched their highest level and is expected to be about Rs. 1.43 lakh cr in BE 2019-20.

 

Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) are gateways to India’s superfast growth and development. First sections of Eastern DFC (Bhadan to Khurja, 200 Kms) and Western DFC (Rewari to Madar, 200 Kms) have been completed.

 

Railways is improving passenger services including a complete makeover of Stations by installing modern facilities including escalators, lifts, free wifi etc. and using local art in the design. 4 stations are undergoing redevelopment - Habibganj, Gandhinagar, Charbagh and Gomtinagar. Beautification of 65 stations has been completed using local art. Railways has improved trains and coaches including launching the Tejas, Antyodaya and Humsafar trains and Deen Dayalu and Anubhuti coaches. Connecting passengers to the digital world, high speed WiFi service has been provided at more than 800 stations. Pan India rollout of paperless Unreserved Ticketing (UTS) has been done to make ticketing convenient and hassle free.

 

Catering has also been a focus area with compulsory printing of MRP on all food items and use of artificial intelligence to monitor food production in base kitchens for improving quality and hygiene.

 

Offering its tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and contributing to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, Railways has paid attention to hygiene with efforts such as record installation of Bio-toilets, third party independent surveys, integrated mechanized cleaning and On Board Housekeeping Services (OBHS)

 

Indian Railways is also playing its part in promoting tourism and providing a wonderful experience to tourists. It is also connecting Indias to their roots with the launch of Ramayan Express, Panj Takht Express, and Buddhist Circuit Train.

 

Rail Drishti dashboard has been launched, encompassing all the digitisation efforts in Indian Railways and promoting transparency and accountability. It brings information from various sources on a single platform and gives access to key statistics and parameters to every citizen of the country. The available information has been categorized under 15 user friendly sections on the Dashboard.

 

India’s first National Rail & Transportation Institute has been launched with 1st academic session started with two undergraduate programmes - B.Sc. in Transportation Technology & BBA in Transportation Management with 103 students. Rs. 421 crore has been sanctioned for next 5 years.

 

Recognising the significance of empowering and upskilling the Railways family, various steps have been taken including delegation of powers. Historic recruitment drive is being undertaken with 1.5 lakh vacancies being filled. 2.3 lakh individuals will be recruited over next two years.

 

Indian Railways has also focused on digital initiatives for bringing transparency and accountability to its business practices. E- reverse auction policy has been issued. 100% e- Procurement is being done through a single web-portal. Simpler approval processes in Research Designs and Standards Organisation have reduced process time from 30 months to 6 months.

 

Highlights of Achievements & Initiatives of Ministry of Coal:-

Coal powers the million aspirations of India. To ensure energy security, reduce imports and realise the vision of 24x7 Power for All, Coal India has enhanced drilling, production & offtake of coal. 105 MT increase in coal production since 2014 took almost 7 years to achieve before 2013-14. Production target of Coal India is 610 MT in 2018-19. As a result of record performance, number of coal plants with critical stock is only 4 out of 125 (as on 20th February, 2019) compared to 2/3rd coal plants with critical stock in 2014.

 

Further, to boost the power sector, superior Coal Quality has been ensured with steps such as third party sampling procedures and 100% crushed coal to power plants. Coal India is also delivering benefits of reduced cost of electricity as now amount of coal required to generate per unit of electricity (specific coal

consumption)has been reduced by 8% since 2014.

 

Brining the spirit of reform to coal sector, Commercial Coal Mining, the most ambitious reform in Coal Mining after Nationalisation in 1973 was introduced. This will reduce import dependency and bring energy security through assured coal supply. Further, transparent e-auction and allocation of coal blocks has led to successfully auction of 85 coal mines. Rationalization of coal linkages has led to total rationalisation of 61 MT with annual potential savings of about Rs. 3,651 crore (till date). Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala Transparently in India (SHAKTI), for auction and allotment of coal linkages, will lead to affordable power and transparency in allocation of coal. 16 Fuel Supply Agreements have been signed under this scheme. Timeline for 14 critical projects for evacuating coal has been established for time bound execution to increase coal transportation.

 

Railways and coal together are the Engine of New India. Tremendous progress has been made in both these sectors to reform and modernise them. These steps will empower every ordinary Indian and set foundation for a New India.

                The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India has recently awarded Geographical Indication (GI) to five varieties of Indian coffee. They are:


	Coorg Arabica coffee is grown specifically in the region of Kodagu district in Karnataka.
	Wayanaad Robusta coffee is grown specifically in the region of Wayanad district which is situated on the eastern portion of Kerala. 
	Chikmagalur Arabica coffee is grown specifically in the region of Chikmagalur district and it is situated in the Deccan plateau, belongs to the Malnad region of Karnataka.
	Araku Valley Arabica coffee can be described as coffee from the hilly tracks of Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha region at an elevation of 900-1100 Mt MSL. The coffee produce of Araku, by the tribals, follows an organic approach in which they emphasise management practices involving substantial use of organic manures, green manuring and organic pest management practices. 
	Bababudangiris Arabica coffee is grown specifically in the birthplace of coffee in India and the region is situated in the central portion of Chikmagalur district. Selectively hand-picked and processed by natural fermentation, the cup exhibits full body, acidity, mild flavour and striking aroma with a note of chocolate. This coffee is also called high grown coffee which slowly ripens in the mild climate and thereby the bean acquires a special taste and aroma.


The Monsooned Malabar Robusta Coffee, a unique specialty coffee from India, was given GI certification earlier. 

In India, coffee is cultivated in about 4.54 lakh hectares by 3.66 lakh coffee farmers of which 98% are small farmers. Coffee cultivation is mainly done in the Southern States of India: 


	Karnataka – 54%
	Kerala – 19%
	Tamil Nadu – 8%


Coffee is also grown in non-traditional areas like Andhra Pradesh and Odisha (17.2%) and North East States (1.8%).

India is the only country in the world where the entire coffee cultivation is grown under shade, hand-picked and sun dried. India produces some of the best coffee in the world, grown by tribal farmers in the Western and Eastern Ghats,which are the two major bio-diversity hotspots in the world. Indian coffeeis highly valued in the world market and sold as premium coffee in Europe. 

The recognition and protection that comes with GI certification will allow the coffee producers of India to invest in maintaining the specific qualities of the coffee grown in that particular region. It will also enhance the visibility of Indian coffee in the world and allow growers to get maximum price for their premium coffee.

                European and Oceania countries are major trading partners and major sources of investments for India and there is huge untapped potential that can be achieved. India has made efforts in the recent past to take economic ties to the next level and have some sort of broad based comprehensive trade agreement. There is a need to take these efforts to a logical conclusion. This was stated by Commerce Secretary, Dr. Anup Wadhawan, at an interactive session on trade and economic cooperation with Ambassadors and High Commissioners of European and Oceania countries in New Delhi last evening. 

Dr. Anup Wadhawan said like most trade negotiations between developing and developed countries, trade negotiations with EU and Oceania have been protracted. India is a developing country and EU and Oceania countries are predominantly developed and because of this our ambitions, aspirations and sensitivities are at divergence in some specific areas. He expressed the hope that India, European Union and Oceania countries will be able to overcome those issues and in the near future come to an understanding and reach some sort of formal agreement. It is important to remain engaged at every level - government, export and trade and investment related institutions, exporters and businesses to understand the opportunities available in India, EU and Oceania for business, exporters and importers, Dr. Wadhawan added. He also emphasized on the need to appreciate each other’s constraints and try to find a way forward which is doable for all stakeholders. 

Bilateral trade between India and Europe crossed the USD 150 billion mark in 2011-12. Global slowdown and commodity price fluctuations adversely impacted the trade, but there are signs of recovery in the recent period. During 2017-18, India’s trade with Europe stood at USD 130.1 billion, with both exports and imports registering double digit growth.

India is the fifth largest export market for Australia, with coal, education –related travel, vegetable and gold being some of the major items of imports by India. Major exports from India to Australia include refined petroleum, business services and pharmaceuticals. New Zealand is also an important market for India in the Oceania region, especially for its exports of pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, machinery and textiles and apparel. 

The extent of investment linkages is evident from the fact that nearly one-fourth of FDI inflows into India are from Europe and around 29.8 percent of India’s overseas direct investments and directed towards Europe. 

Nearly, USD 1034.2 million was invested by companies from Oceania in the Indian market during April 2000 to December 2018. The Oceania region also accounts for nearly 1.7 percent of India’s overseas FDI, with Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu being the key investment destinations.

Commerce Secretary,Dr.AnupWadhawan activating coffee e-marketplace in New Delhi

Commerce Secretary,Dr.AnupWadhawan, launched blockchain based coffee e-marketplace through video conferencing in New Delhi today. Speaking on the occasion he said that this pilot project will help integrate the farmers with markets in a transparent manner and lead to realisation of fair price for the coffee producer. Dr.Wadhawan said that the blockchain will also reduce the number of layers between coffee growers and buyers and help farmers double their income. 

The project was activated simultaneously by Mr. Jose DausterSette, Executive Director,International Coffee Organisation’s (ICO) from Nairobi, Kenya. Rahul Chhabra, India’s High Commissioner to Kenya was also present.

India is the only country in the world where entire coffee is grown under shade, handpicked and sun dried. It produces one of the best coffees in the world, produced by small coffee growers, tribal farmers adjacent to National Parks and Wild Life Sanctuaries in the Western and Eastern Ghats, which are two of the major bio-diversity hot spots in the world. Indian coffee is highly valued in the world market and sold as premium coffees. The share of farmers in the final returns from coffee is very meagre. 

Blockchain based market place app for trading of Indian coffees is intended to bring in transparency in the trade of Indian coffee, maintain the traceability of Indian coffee from bean to cup so as the consumer tastes real Indian coffee and the grower is paid fairly for his coffee produced. This initiative will help in creating a brand image for Indian Coffee throughtraceability in reducing growers dependency an intermediaries by having a direct access to buyers for a fair price for their produce, in finding right coffee suppliers for exporters and within the stipulated time to meet the growing demands and in building a better trust and long term relationship due to increased visibility towards the traceability and transparency of the produce. 

Coffee Board is collaborating with M/s Eka Plus, one of the global leaders in Digital Commodity Management platforms for Agriculture for development of Blockchain based marketplace application.Eka Plus have developed the application and a group of 15-20 coffee farmers, exporters, roasters, importers and retailers are already registered on the platform from India and abroad. It is one of the few coffee block chain processor for coffee  after France and Ethiopia in the world. 

The stakeholder like coffee farmers, traders, coffee curers, exporters, rosters, importers and retailers register on the platform to make trade transactions. The coffee farmer registers credentials like place where coffee is grown, details of the crop, elevation, certificates if any and any relevant information. A block is created for each of the lot the farmer sells on the Blockchain. The credentials of the block/ lot will be stored on the Blockchain throughout its journey and are immutable.

He said this conclave marks the pre-eminence of India-Africa partnership in the realm of South - South Cooperation at a time when the global economy is faced with intractable challenges that stem from rising protectionism and trade conflicts. The India-Africa bilateral partnershipisfurther augmented by India’s ascendency as the   growing major economy, as well as Africa’s new economic dynamism illustrated by some of the sub-Saharan economies featuring among the top 10 fastest growing economies in the world.

The Commerce Secretary said that the conclave coheres into the Indian government’s larger vision of long–term engagement with Africa and Government of India’s unwavering commitment to expanding the canvas of India – Africa economic partnership. He said several Indian engineering companies have been engaged in bridging the gaps in physical infrastructure in Africa by way of development of roads, highways, ports, power generation and distribution and watershed projects that connected different African countries.India’s development cooperation ranges from power projects and dams in Sudan and Rwanda to water treatment plants in Tanzania, sugar factories in Ethiopia and IT Parks in Mozambique and Swaziland, building of the Presidential Place in Ghana and National Assembly building in the Gambia, besides other numerous projects.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for accession of India to (i) The Nice Agreement concerning the International classification of Goods and Services for the purposes of registration of marks, (ii) The Vienna Agreement establishing an International Classification of the figurative elements of marks, and (iii) The Locarno Agreement establishing an International classification for industrial designs.

Accession to the Nice, Vienna and Locarno Agreements will help the Intellectual Property Office in India to harmonise the classification systems for examinational of trademark and design applications, in line with the classification systems followed globally.

It would give an opportunity to include Indian designs, figurative elements and goods in the international classification systems.

The accession is expected to instill confidence in foreign investors in relation to protection of IPs in India.

The accession would also facilitate in exercising rights in decision making processes regarding review and revision of the classifications under the agreement.

                For sensitizing small laboratories to basic doable quality practices, NABL has launched another voluntary scheme called Quality Assurance Scheme (QAS) for Basic Composite (BC) Medical Laboratories (Entry Level) in February, 2019. The laboratories performing only basic routine tests like blood glucose, blood counts, rapid tests for common infections, liver & kidney function tests and routine tests of urine will be eligible to apply under this scheme. To encourage small pathology laboratories, the base criterion of the scheme is based on the requirements enlisted in Gazette notification dated 18th May, 2018 by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) to amend Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Rules, 2012. The scheme requires minimal documentation and a nominal fee has been prescribed for availing the scheme. Components of competence assessment have been added for assuring quality and validity of test results. 

 

The scheme will help to bring quality at the grass root level of India’s health system where laboratories follow the imperatives of quality in all their processes. This will inculcate the habit of quality and facilitate the laboratories to achieve benchmark accreditation of ISO 15189 over a period of time. The laboratories may upgrade to accreditation as per ISO 15189 at any point of time. Successful laboratories will be issued a certificate of compliance to QAS BC scheme by NABL and they will be allowed to use a distinct symbol on the test reports as a mark of endorsement to the basic standard for a defined time frame before which they will have to transition to full accreditation as per ISO 15189.

 

To familiarize and encourage more and more small labs, even in the remotest part of the country, to avail the scheme, NABL will organize awareness programs in various cities of India. The scheme is expected to bring transformational change in more than 5000 laboratories over the next 5 years and to transform them into labs providing quality service. 

 

Through this scheme, patients availing services of small labs in primary health centers, community health centers, doctor’s clinic, standalone small labs, labs in small nursing homes will also have access to quality lab results.

 

State Governments are being encouraged to adopt this entry level scheme for registering labs as establishments under Clinical Establishment Act. So far, the Act has been implemented in 11 states and all Union Territories. This will help organize the sector of diagnostics in these states. 

 

This scheme will also give a much needed support to Ayushmaan Bharat Yojana of Government of India. Under this Yojana, Government plans to set up 1,50,000 wellness centers which will cover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families. This entry level scheme of NABL will, enhance the intent of Ayushmaan Bharat Yojana of universal access to quality healthcare for majority of citizens especially those residing in villages and small towns by providing them access to quality diagnostics.

 

Small laboratories who wish to achieve quality through QAS BC scheme may apply to NABL in application document NABL 155 available on NABL Website www.nabl-india.org

 

In addition to the existing accreditation scheme for Medical Laboratories as per ISO 15189 standard, NABL has also launched the ‘Recognition of Sample Collection Centers of Medical Testing Laboratories’ last year. The objective is to assess all declared Sample Collection Centers and Facilities (SFCs) of Medical Testing laboratories. This will ensure end-to-end sample integrity leading to reliable test results and help laboratories to gain patient’s trust and satisfaction. The scheme has proved to be a success and about 1300 SCFs have been recognized by NABL since the launch of this scheme.

 

Accurate, reliable pathology laboratory results are critical aids which enable doctors to provide evidence-based patient care and treatment. The Accreditation program for Medical Laboratories is as per International standard ISO 15189. The program covers all disciplines of Medical Testing like Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical Pathology, Haematology & Immunohaematology, Microbiology & Serology, Histopathology, Cytopathology, Genetics and Nuclear Medicine (in-vitro testing only). Approximately 1100 Medical Laboratories have been granted accreditation under this program.

 

NABL is Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) signatory to International bodies like International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation (ILAC) and Asia Pacific Accreditation Co-operation (APAC) for accreditation of Testing including Medical and Calibration laboratories. NABL is also having APAC Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) for Proficiency Testing Provider (PTP) & Reference Materials Producers (RMP). MRA are based on evaluation by peer Accreditation Bodies and facilitates acceptance of test/ calibration results between countries which MRA partners represent. Thus NABL accredited laboratory results are accepted across more than 80 economies around the world. 

 

National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) is a constituent board of Quality Council of India (QCI) under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India.

                United States of Americatoday has given a 60-day withdrawal notice to Indiaon the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) benefits extended by US. 

Since the review initiated by the US in April 2018 on India's GSP benefits, India and US have been discussing various trade issues of bilateral interest for a suitable resolution on mutually acceptable terms. GSP benefits are envisaged to be non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory benefits extended by developed countries to developing countries. In India's case the GSP concessions extended by the US amounted to duty reduction of only USD 190 million per annum.

The US had initiated the review on the basis of representations by the US medical devices and dairy industries, but subsequently included numerous other issues on a self-initiated basis. These included issues related to market access for various agriculture and animal husbandry products, relaxation / easing of procedures related to issues like telecom testing / conformity assessmentand tariff reduction on ICT products.  The Department of Commerce engaged with various Government of India departments concerned with these issues, and India was able to offer a very meaningful way forward on almost all the US requests. In a few instances, specific US requests were not found reasonable and doable at this time by the departments concerned, in light of public welfare concerns reflective of India's developing country status and its national interest. 

India was ready to address US concerns regarding medical devices in principle, by putting in place a suitable trade margin approach in a reasonable time frame to balance concerns about fair pricing for the consumers and adequate remuneration for the suppliers.On the issue of dairy market access, India has clarified that while our certification requirement, that the source animal had never been fed animal derived blood meal,is non-negotiable given the cultural and religious sentiment, the requested simplified dairy certification procedure, without diluting this requirement, could be considered.Acceptability of US market access requests related to products like alfalfa hay, cherries and pork was conveyed.On reduction of our IT duties, India's duties are moderate and not import stopping. Any MFN duty reduction would almost entirely benefit third countries. Accordingly, India conveyed willingness to extend duty concessions on specific items in which there is a clear US interest. On telecom testing, India was willing to consider discussions for a Mutual Recognition Agreement.

Due to various initiatives resulting in enhanced purchase of US goods like oil and natural gas and coal the US trade deficit with India has substantially reduced in calendar years 2017 and 2018. The reduction is estimated to be over USD 4 Billion in 2018, with further reduction expected in future years on account of factors like the growing demand for energy and civilian aircrafts in India. This reduction has happened in the face of a rising overall US trade deficit, including with some other major economies. India is also a thriving market for US services and e-commerce companies like Amazon, Uber, Google and Facebook with billions of dollars of revenue.    

The issue of Indian tariffs being high has been raised from time to time. It is pertinent that India’s tariffs are within its bound rates under WTO commitments, and are on the average well below these bound rates. India’s trade weighted average tariffs are 7.6%, which is comparable with the most open developing economies, and some developed economies. On developmental considerations there may be a few tariff peaks, which is true for almost all economies.

India was agreeable to a very meaningful mutually acceptable package on the above lines to be agreed to at this time, while keeping remaining issues under discussion in the future.

                The Ministers from the 16 RCEP Participating Countries (RPCs) attended the 7th RCEP Intersessional Ministerial Meeting held on 2 March 2019 in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The Meeting, which was chaired by Chutima Bunyapraphasara, Acting Minister of Commerce of Thailand, reviewed the developments since the 2nd RCEP Summit on 14 November 2018 in Singapore, particularly the outcomes of the 2nd Special TNC Meeting held on 25-26 January 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia, and the 25th RCEP Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) Meeting and Related Meetings held on 19-28 February 2019 in Bali, Indonesia. 

Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, also attended the 7th RCEP Intersessional Ministerial Meeting in Cambodia. Following is the Joint Statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting:

The Ministers recalled the Leaders’ determination to conclude a modern, comprehensive, high quality, and mutually beneficial RCEP in 2019, and resolved to exert utmost effort to achieve this target. They commended the RCEP Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) for the good progress made to date on both market access and text-based negotiations but at the same time recognized that more work still needs to be done to advance both aspects of the negotiations.  The Ministers urged all RPCs to address specific sensitivities while working towards achieving commercially meaningful outcomes. The Ministers remained confident that with collective commitment and pragmatism, the chapters and annexes that would comprise the RCEP Agreement can be concluded soon. The Ministers reiterated that it is the collective responsibility of all RPCs to ensure progress by overcoming negotiation challenges and finding resolution to the remaining issues through constructive engagement. 

To ensure that progress is made towards meeting the Leaders’ target for conclusion in 2019, the Ministers agreed to intensify engagement for the remaining of the year, including by convening more intersessional meetings. The Ministers agreed to meet next at the [8th RCEP Intersessional Ministerial Meeting to be held after the 27th RCEP TNC Meeting and Related Meetings in July/August 2019] [7th RCEP Ministerial Meeting in September 2019].

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, has reached Siem Reap in Cambodia for the Seventh Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Intersessional Ministerial Meeting (7th RCEP ISSL MM) to be held on 2nd March 2019.

The 7th RCEP ISSL MM will see bilateral sessions and opening ceremony attended by Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Mr. Hun Sen. Ministers from 16 RCEP Participating Countries (RPCs) will be attending the 7th RCEP ISSL MM. The meeting will be chaired by ChutimaBunyapraphasara, Acting Minister of Commerce of Thailand. In this meeting, developments since the second RCEP summit held on 14th November 2018 in Singapore will be reviewed, particularly the outcomes of the 2nd Special Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) meeting held on 25-26 January 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia and the 25th RCEP TNC meeting and Related Meetings held on 19-28 February 2019 in Bali, Indonesia.

Union Commerce Minister said that after 5 years of hard and intense negotiations India, at the end of the second RCEP Summit, is now perceived as the constructive player of RCEP, providing guidance and building consensus on critical areas by taking into consideration the concerns and aspirations of all member countries. This will ensure that there is no marginalization of request of smaller countries and there is room for ‘policy space’ for developing countries in transition as it will help to moderate ambitions particularly in the goods negotiations and lead to balanced and mutually beneficial outcomes.

Suresh Prabhu also lauded the role played by Singapore as chair.During the term of the Singapore chair, several ministerial and experts’ meetings resulted in successful conclusion of five chapters taking total number of chapters concluded so far to 7 out of 16. At the RCEP Trade Ministers’ Meeting on 12-13 November 2018 Singapore deftly steered the consensus on ‘substantial progress’ instead of ‘substantial conclusion’.

At the Ministerial, India’s flexibility helped in facilitating successful conclusion of three chapters, namely (i) institutional provisions; (ii) Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) measures and (iii) Standards, Technical Regulations and Conformity Assessment Procedure (STRACAP). In the chapter on Institutional Provisions, India agreed to the proposed ‘consensus principle’ on the understanding that the RCEP Secretariat to be set up subsequently will ensure participation of all member countries in the decision making process. 

The Regional Comprehensive Partnership (RCEP) is a proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between sixteen countries namely 10 countries of ASEAN (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) and their six FTA partners (also known as AFP’s or ASEAN FTA Partners) namely Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. 

The RCEP has entered the sixth year of negotiations. During the last five years 24 Rounds of negotiations at the expert level were held – the last Round was held from 18-27 October, 2018 in Auckland; six Ministerial meetings and seven inter-sessional Ministerial meetings were held so far - the 6th Ministerial meeting held on 30-31 August, 2018 in Singapore and the 7thinter-sessional Ministerial meeting held on 12-13 November, 2018 in Singapore; and two RCEP Leaders’ Summitswere held. During the 2nd RCEP Summit on 14 November 2018 in Singapore, Leaders acknowledged the ‘substantial progress’ in the negotiations and reiterated their determination to conclude a modern, comprehensive, high quality, and mutually beneficial RCEP in 2019.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for funds amounting to Rs.2790 crore towards interest subvention for extending indicative loan amount of Rs.12900 crore by banks to the sugar mills under “Scheme for extending financial assistance to sugar mills for enhancement and augmentation of ethanol production capacity” for the 268 applications/proposals, in addition to Rs.1332 crore already approved by CCEA in June, 2018.

 

CCEA has also approved Rs.565 crore towards interest subvention for extending indicative loan amount of Rs.2600 crore by banks to the molasses based standalone distilleries to augment capacity through installation of incineration boilers and other methods in the existing distilleries for achieving ZLD and additional equipment for ethanol production as well as for setting up of new standalone distilleries for ethanol production.  A separate scheme for the molasses based standalone distilleries would be formulated accordingly by Department of Food & Public Distribution.

 

In continuation of the earlier scheme approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in June, 2018 and with a view to support sugar sector and in the interest of sugarcane farmers, the CCEA chaired by the Prime Minister today approved the proposal for extending soft loans of about Rs. 15500 crores through banks to sugar mills and molasses based stand alone distilleries under the Scheme for extending financial assistance for enhancement and augmentation of ethanol production capacity for which Government  will bear further interest subvention amounting to Rs. 3355 crore for five years including moratorium period of one year.  As a result of implementation of the scheme being notified after this decision of CCEA and the earlier scheme approved by CCEA in June, 2018, the country will have sufficient capacity to divert surplus sugar during surplus phase for production of ethanol.  

 

Government has notified National Policy on Bio-fuels in year 2018 under which diversion of B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice to produce ethanol has been allowed in surplus seasons. In order to augment ethanol production capacity and thereby also allow diversion of sugar for production of ethanol, in earlier approved scheme, soft loan is being extended through banks to the sugar mills for setting up new distilleries/ expansion of existing distilleries and installation of incineration boilers or installation of any method as approved by Central Pollution Control Board for Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) for which Government had approved interest subvention of Rs. 1332 crore. In principle approval was accorded by Government for extending soft loans of about Rs. 6139 crores to 114 sugar mills under that scheme.  

 

However, in order to further enhance and augment the ethanol production capacity in the country, it has now been decided by Government to extend soft loans amounting to Rs 12900 crores to some more sugar mills for setting up new distilleries/ expansion of existing distilleries and installation of incineration boilers or installation of any method as approved by Central Pollution Control Board for Zero Liquid Discharge for which Government will bear interest subvention of Rs. 2790 crore. About 268 sugar mills are likely to be benefitted as a result of this measure.

 

Besides, to further optimize the ethanol production capacity, it has also been decided to extend soft loans amounting to Rs. 2600 crores by banks to the molasses based stand-alone distilleries to augment capacity through installation of incineration boilers and other methods in the existing distilleries for achieving ZLD and additional equipments for ethanol production as well as for setting up of new stand-alone distilleries for ethanol production for which Government  will bear interest subvention of Rs. 565 crore. 

 

This decision would further help in achieving blending target for mixing ethanol and in achieving the objectives of National Bio-Fuel Policy, 2018 and to reduce sugar inventories by diversion of B-Heavy molasses and sugarcane juice for ethanol production and thereby sacrificing sugar during surplus phase.  It will also improve liquidity of sugar mills by way of value addition to their revenues from supply of ethanol under Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme (EBP) thereby facilitating them to clear cane price dues of farmers. 

 

Benefits:

The approval of interest subvention will help in: 


	improving liquidity of sugar mills by way of value addition to their revenues from supply of ethanol under Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme (EBP);
	reducing sugar inventories and thereby facilitate timely clearance of cane price dues of farmers and
	achieving 10% blending target of EBP.

                The Central Government with a view to manage the situation of surplus production in the country and to stabilize the sugar prices with a view to clear cane price arrears of farmers has been  implementing the Sugar Price (Control) Order, 2018 along with imposition of stock holding limits on sugar mills.

In exercise of powers conferred by section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (10 of 1955) read with clause 4 and 5 of the Sugar (Control) Order, 1966 and Order of the Government of India vide S.O. No.2347 (E) dated 07.06.2018, the Central Government has been issuing stock holding order for every month since June, 2018, inter-alia, indicating therein the mill-wise quantity of white/ refined sugar prescribed for domestic sale/despatch for that particular month.  

In the monthly stock holding limit order for the month of March, 2019 issued on 28.02.2019, 24.5 LMT of white/refined sugar has been prescribed for domestic sale/dispatch. This increase is attributable to various factors. There is a pattern of high sales/dispatches around this time of the year; during February, 2018 sales/dispatch of sugar were at 23.54 LMT. Besides, sugar industry has recently been advised to go for advance booking of sugar sales to bulk consumers. It is also to be noted that the Government has only recently increased the minimum selling price of sugar (MSP) from Rs. 29 to Rs. 31 /kg.  The said increase is to provide an opportunity to mills to realise maximum revenue from sales at enhanced MSP to improve their liquidity to clear cane price arrears of farmers. 

With the Sugar Price (Control) Order, 2018 being in vogue, sugar mills cannot sell their sugar at ex-mill price which is below MSP and any violation of the same would attract severe penal action under the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Hence, any apprehension about excess allocation of sugar for domestic sale under the stock holding limit order for the month of March, 2019 is unwarranted.

                In a major decision to improve liquidity position of sugar mills and to help the sugar industry clear its cane dues arrears to farmers, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal to provide soft loans to the extent of Rs. 7900-10540 crore to the sugar industry. Government will bear the interest subvention cost @ 7 - 10% to the extent of Rs. 553 crore to Rs 1054 crore for one year. 

To ensure that farmers are paid their dues expeditiously, the Government has mandated that banks will obtain from the sugar mill, the list of farmers with bank account details to the extent cane dues are to be paid, so that the same are directly paid into the accounts of the farmers on behalf of the sugar mills. Subsequent balance if any, will then be credited into the mill’s account.

Furthermore, in order to incentivize the mills to clear their dues, CCEA has also decided that the approved soft loans will be provided to those units which have already cleared at least 25 percent of their outstanding dues in the sugar season 2018-19.

Surplus sugar production over domestic consumption requirement during the last sugar season 2017-18 (October, 2017 to September, 2018) has adversely affected the liquidity position of the sugar mills resulting in building up of cane price arrears of farmers which reached to an alarming level of Rs 23232 crores in May, 2018. To mitigate the situation and protect the livelihoods of cane farmers, the Government, in fact, has taken several steps in the sugar season 2017-18 viz. fixed minimum selling price of white sugar to Rs.29/kg w.e.f 7.06.2018, allocated mill wise Minimum Indicative Export Quota (MIEQ) of 20 LMT, extending assistance to sugar mills @Rs.5.50/quintal to offset the cost of cane, created buffer stock of 30 LMT, fixed Remunerative Price of ethanol derived from C-heavy and B-heavy molasses as well as from sugarcane juice, etc. As a result of these measures cane price arrears for sugar season 2017-18 which peaked to Rs 23232 crore at the end of May, 2018, has been reduced considerably to Rs 1291 crore, as on 28.02.2019.

Surplus production is also estimated in the current sugar season 2018-19 which has affected the liquidity position of sugar mills resulting in building up of cane price arrears of farmers which has reached to the level of Rs. 20159 crore as on 22.02.2019. In order to improve to liquidity of sugar mills to enable them to clear cane dues of farmers, the Government has increased minimum selling price of white sugar from Rs.29/kg to Rs.31/kg with effect from 14.02.2019, allocated mill wise Minimum Indicative Export Quota (MIEQ) of 50 LMT, extending assistance to sugar mills @ Rs.13.88/ quintal for sugar season and extending assistance for defraying expenditure towards internal transport, freight, handling and other charges to facilitate export of sugar. Further, with a view to liquidate cane price dues of sugarcane farmers, the Central Government has now decided to extend soft loans of about Rs 7900-10540 crore to sugar mills through banks to facilitate payment of cane dues of the farmers for the current sugar season 2018-19 for which Government would bear interest subvention of about Rs 553 crore to Rs 1054 crore for one year.

                Ministry of Corporate Affairs has revised the National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business, 2011 (NVGs) and formulated the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC). These guidelines urge businesses to actualise the principles in letter and spirit.

These principles are:

1.      Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity in a manner that is Ethical, Transparent and Accountable.

2.      Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe

3.      Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their value chains.

4.      Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all their stakeholders.

5.      Businesses should respect and promote human rights.

6.      Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment.

7.      Businesses, when engaging in influencing public and regulatory policy, should do so in a manner that is responsible and transparent.

8.      Businesses should promote inclusive growth and equitable development.

9.      Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner.

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has been taking various initiatives for ensuring responsible business conduct by companies. As a first step towards mainstreaming the concept of business responsibility, the 'Voluntary Guidelines on Corporate Social Responsibility’ were issued in 2009. These guidelines were subsequently revised as 'National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business, 2011 (NVGS)’ after extensive consultations with business, academia, civil society organisations and the government. The NVGs were developed based on India’s socio-cultural context and priorities as well as global best practices.

There have been various national and international developments in the past decade that have nudged businesses to be sustainable and more responsible, prior most being the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights (UNGPs).  These became the key drivers for further revision of the guidelines. Some of these include the thrust of Companies Act, 2013 (Act) on businesses to be more mindful of their stakeholders.  The Act casts fiduciary duties on the Directors of a Company (S. 166) requiring them to promote the objects of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in the best interests of the company, its employees, the shareholders, the community and for the protection of environment. There was also a need to demonstrate more visibly India’s implementation of the UNGPs based on UNHRC’s ‘Protect, Respect & Remedy’ Framework and also make evident India’s commitment to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) through its ‘Listing Regulations’  in 2012 mandated the top 100 listed entities by market capitalisation to file Business Responsibility Reports (BRRs) from an environmental, social and governance perspective. These BRRs enabled business to demonstrate the adoption of the NVG principles and the attendant core elements with the intent of engaging businesses more meaningfully with their stakeholders going beyond regulatory financial compliance. This was extended to top 500 companies in FY 2015-16. This, for the first time, introduced voluntary sustainability reporting among companies in India which is still in a nascent stage.

In furtherance to updation of NVGs and formulation of the NGRBCs, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has constituted the Committee on Business Responsibility Reporting (BRR) to develop BRR formats for listed and unlisted companies. Non-financial reporting is increasingly forming the basis for enhancing investor confidence in businesses and increasing their creditworthiness. The Committee is to develop comprehensive yet simple formats situating the various stakeholders at the center so as to not increase or duplicate reporting burden. The proposed formats are to reflect linkages to prevalent non-financial reporting formats, viz, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Integrated Reporting (IR) etc., and SDGs from a NGRBC perspective.

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs is also in the process of developing India’s National Action Plan on Business & Human Rights (NAP) in consultation with various Ministries and State Governments by 2020. A Zero Draft of India’s NAP demonstrating implementation of the three pillars of UNGPs has also been released and uploaded on the website of the Ministry.

                The Government has approved establishment of two new benches of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), one at Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh and the other at Indore in Madhya Pradesh. This step has been taken keeping in view the increasing case load, especially under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code 2016.

The jurisdiction of the Bench at Amaravati will be the state of Andhra Pradesh and that of Indore will be the state of Madhya Pradesh. At present Andhra Pradesh comes under the Jurisdiction of NCLT Bench at Hyderabad and Madhya Pradesh comes under the jurisdiction of NCLT Bench, Ahmedabad.  It is expected that creation of new benches will enable faster disposal of cases.

            The NCLT, which has been set up under the Companies Act, 2013, has provided an effective and time bound adjudication mechanism to deal with matters related to the Companies Act, 2013, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 and the LLP Act, 2008.  The Act provides for appointment of a President and such number of Members as the Government may deem necessary. As on date there are 17 Judicial Members and 10 Technical Members.  Presently, 14 numbers of NCLT Benches have been established, including the Principal Bench in New Delhi, and three recently set up benches at Jaipur, Kochi and Cuttack.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology tomorrow, on 9th March, 2019 at 12:00 noon at Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and Minister of State (I/c) of Culture & MoS of Environment & Forest Dr. Mahesh Sharma will also attend the event. The Prime Minister will also unveil the statue of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya installed in the premises of the Institute. The foundation stone of the Institute Building was laid by the Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh   on 28th October, 2016 during the celebrations of 100th Birth Anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.

The Institute of Archaeology (IA) is an academic wing of ASI under the Ministry of Culture. In the Institute , the students are provided with a supportive, enthusiastic and challenging academic atmosphere which enables them to achieve their full potential in the field of Archaeology. The Institute conducts professional workshops in different fields of archaeology. The foremost aim of this Institute is to provide an opportunity to students to achieve excellence in their passionate fields of archaeology.

 The state-of-the-art institute, built at an estimated cost of Rs. 289 crore is spread in over 25 acres. The 3 star ultra modern green building of the Institute is equipped with all latest technologies. The Institute comprises of an auditorium with seating capacity of 1000 people, an open air theatre and an Archaeological Museum.

The Institute of Archaeology (IA) under Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) imparts training in Archaeology and allied archaeological activities.  In 1985, the Institute was shifted to a colonial structure at 24, Tilak Marg, New Delhi and later on to Red Fort, Delhi.  It was realized that the space available at the Institute is far from adequate to accommodate its ever-growing demands of a self contained multi-disciplinary Institution for imparting training, pursuing research, archaeological and excavation related studies/activities.  To carry out training research and study of archaeology and related activities in a full-fledged manner, ASI purchased 25 acres of land at Greater Noida at a cost of Rs.4.77 crore for construction of complex for Institute of Archaeology.

 

In 1959, the School of Archaeology was started by ASI under the directorship of the renowned archaeologist Shri B.B. Lal. The School of Archaeology transformed to Institute of Archaeology in 1983 as per R.N. Mirdha Committee Report.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today released the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle, at an event in Lok Kalyan Marg, New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, he said this five-volume dictionary contains an account of the martyrs from India’s First War of Independence in 1857, to India’s Independence in 1947.

He said that this includes the martyrs of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the non-cooperation movement, the Quit India Movement, and those soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauj, who attained martyrdom, among many others. He said that this was the first attempt at compiling the names of martyrs on this scale. He appreciated all those involved with the compilation, and the effort behind it.

The Prime Minister asserted that a nation that does not honour and remember those who created, or are an important part, of its history, often does not have a secure future. In that sense, he added that this effort, is not just a way to cherish the past, but is also a way to secure the future. He said that youth should especially be made aware of this effort.

The Prime Minister said that the effort of the Union Government is to nurture and recall the brave deeds of the heroes of our freedom struggle. He said this has a positive influence on the future generations, and inspires them to think of “India First.”

The Prime Minister said that India, so far, did not have a war memorial since independence. He said that recently, he dedicated the National War Memorial, or Rashtriya Samar Smaarak, to the nation. Similarly, he said the National Police Memorial has also been built. He also mentioned the world’s tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He said that in memory of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Azad Hind Fauj, the Kranti Mandir has been established at Red Fort. He said museums are also being built to commemorate the brave deeds of the Adivasi heroes who were part of our freedom struggle.

The Union Minister of State for Culture (I/C) Dr. Mahesh Sharma was present on the occasion.

                The National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), an organization under the Ministry of Culture, Government  of India has collaborated with Google Arts & Culture for ‘Once Upon a Try’: Epic journeys of invention and discovery - the largest online exhibition about inventions and discoveries ever curated, as an attempt to explore humanity’s greatest inventions and discoveries in an interactive online exhibition. The online exhibition was launched yesterday and contains collections, stories and knowledge from over 110 renowned institutions from across 23 countries, highlighting millennia of major breakthroughs and the great minds behind them.

Everybody can now explore more than 400 interactive exhibitions that pay tribute to humanity's greatest leaps in science and technology, and the visionaries that shaped our world, as well as tales of epic fails and happy accidents.

National Council of Science Museums contributes six interactive stories that share some key insights into the long and glorious Science and Technology Heritage of India. India's historical contributions to the field are considerable but not well known. The following six sections of the exhibition are key examples:

1.            Historic Beginnings: The Indus Valley Civilization - By the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, we see a fairly developed urban culture emerged along the Indus and Saraswati rivers in the North West India.  The Indus Valley Civilization has a distinct set of features not seen anywhere else in the ancient world. The section is a tribute to the development of human wisdom of technology in the early part of world history. This interactive exhibit explores various facets of the first Urban Civilization - like Town Planning (including sewerage and drainage), standardization of bricks, food security through granaries, cotton and textiles, metallurgical practices, ceramics, pottery, artistically elegant personal ornaments, agriculture, shipping and navigation.

2.            Ayurveda: Indian Contributions to Medicine - This interactive exhibit explores the science of the body and mind, which in India had its origin in the healing arts of the Vedic times. This knowledge and practice, called Ayurveda, emerged as a holistic medical science par excellence by about the fifth century BC. The two great classics of Ayurveda, the Charaka Samhita (ca. 2nd AD) and Susruta Samhita (ca. 4th AD), present a vivid and cogent account of medical knowledge and surgical practices respectively in vogue about 1800 years ago and continue to be used in Ayurveda today.

3.            Susruta Samhita: Ancient Indian Surgical Knowledge - This interactive exhibit explores the Susruta Samhita, which accords pride of place to surgery. It describes more than 300 hundred different operations, like outstanding feats of ancient Indian surgery related to laparotomy, lithotomy and plastic operations, and 121 surgical instruments (20 sharp kinds and 101 accessories) such as tongs, forceps, scalpels, catheters, syringes, speculums, needles, saws, probes, scissors and the like. The. The Susruta Samhita is regarded as the earliest document to give a detailed account of rhinoplasty (plastic reconstruction of the nose), whereas, it was not before the eighteenth century that plastic surgery made an appearance in Europe.

4.            Rasashala: Ancient Indian Alchemical Lab - The section depicts the ancient Indians’ contributions to the science of alchemy (the older form of chemistry) highlighting the usage of a variety of yantras (instruments) for producing mercury and other chemical compounds.

5.            Itr: Ancient Indian Knowledge of Perfumery - Ancient Indians achieved great technical understanding and technological progress in perfumery, due to considerable use of cosmetics and perfumery for the purpose of worship, sale and sensual enjoyment. Brahatsamhita (500 AD) of Varahamihira deals with ‘gandhayukti’ (blending of perfumes) in 37 verses. The word ‘sugandhi’, meaning well perfumed, is also used in Rig Veda. Expressions involving the term ‘gandha’ are found in Taitriya Samhita, Maitrayani Samhita, Satapata Brahman and Taitriya Aranyaka. The ancient traditional method of making itr using hydro distillation is still used at Kannauj, which is acclaimed by the world both as perfumes and as medicines.

6.            Musical Instruments from the Indian Subcontinent - From ancient times, Indian musicians have developed and performed with traditional and indigenous musical instruments that suited their style. Indians played on a variety of string instruments, wind instruments and percussion instruments since antiquity. Apart from the understanding of acoustics necessary for the fabrication of these instruments, Indians also excelled in selecting appropriate materials for the main body and preparation of the alloys or processing of membranes to be suitably used in these instruments.

                The Minister of State for Culture (Independent charge) and Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma inaugurated ‘AzaadikeDiwane’ museum at Red Fort, Delhi today. Created by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the museum within the Red Fort complex pays homage to all the unsung heroes of freedom struggle of the nation, who would have otherwise been merged away in forgetfulness. The museum is fifth in the series of recently inaugurated museums in the Red Fort Complex - others being, Subhash Chandra Bose and INA museum, Yaad-e-Jallian museum, Museum on 1857 - India’s first war of Independence and Drishyakala - Museum on Indian Art. The ‘AzaadikeDiwane’ museum talks about the sacrifices of great freedom fighters. It pays tribute to the selfless sacrifices of the revolutionaries, brave female freedom fighters and valiant children.

Speaking on the occasion the minister said “Under the leadership of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi this new museum ‘AzaadikeDiwane’ is started in the series of KrantiMandir to inspire the younger generation and letting them know the cost of freedom that the great fighters achieve by sacrificing their life.” He congratulated the team of ASI for coming up with this digitized and interactive Museum. 

The museum is a modern state-of-the-art, informative and educational exhibition, involving multi-sensory technologies to engage the visitors. It is so designed that as one moves from one section of the gallery to the other, a sense of awakening and spiritual awareness overwhelms an individual, a feeling of patriotism sweeps through, inspiring the visitors to relive the struggle of the Indian Freedom fighters and value the freedom that we so cherish today.

 

Earlier, on 23rd January 2019, Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the Subhash Chandra Bose and Indian National Army (INA) museum at Red Fort, Delhi. The museum not only provides a detailed account of Netaji’s life and the history of Indian National Army (INA) but also showcases various valuable artefacts related to both.  The Prime Minister on his visit to Red Fort Complex on 23rd January 2019, visited all these museums and gave his tributeto the memory of brave freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the nation.

The Red Fort Complex also houses other museums – the Yaad-e-Jallian museum, the Museum on 1857- India’s first war of Independence and the Drishyakala- Museumon Indian Art. The Yaad-e-Jallian museum provides an authentic account of JallianwalaBagh massacre that happened on April 13th, 1919. The museum also showcases heroism, valour and sacrifices made by Indian soldiers during World War-I. The Museum on 1857- India’s first war of Independence portrays the historical narrative of 1857 war of independence, showcasing the valour and sacrifices made by Indians during the period while the Drishyakala- Museum on Indian Art showcases Indian art works from 16th century till India’s independence.

Muralidharan.

This is a major landmark on IN’s thrust towards GoI's policy of 'Make in India' to encourage indigenous development and promoting private industry participation. It also assumes great significance as it is the first CMS developed by a Private Industry for IN and is for India’s Indigenous Aircraft Carrier. Prior accepting, the system software and hardware were subjected to rigorous acceptance trials. The system successfully cleared all acceptance tests, endurance and full load trials.

                As part of the rehabilitation activities being undertaken by the Southern Naval Command after the devastating floods of August 2018, Vice Admiral Anil Kumar Chawla, AVSM, NM, VSM, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief (C-in-C), Southern Naval Command, handed over the keys of newly constructed houses to three smiling families of Cheriya kadmakkudi on 28 Mar 19.  The houses that were sponsored by the Indian Navy belong to Shri Binu PP of Puliyal Parambil House, Mrs Mariyamma of Pashni Parambil House, and Shri Joseph Antony of Madathil Parambil House, and have been constructed at a total cost of Rs. 28 lakhs. These new houses were built as per specific suggestions and requirements of each house owner. Each house has bedrooms, drawing room and kitchen with modern amenities such as vitrified tiles in all the rooms and electrical fittings etc. The project was being steered by INS Venduruthy and has been completed in precisely five and a half months. 

In addition, the Navy is installing solar power equipment in all the 55 houses of Cheriya Kadmakkudi, of which 30 have been completed, including the three newly constructed houses. Cheriya Kadamakudi, will therefore be a fully Green Village in the next few weeks. 

The residents of the village were in for a big surprise, when the C-in-C announced construction of a steel Arch Bridge connecting Cheriya Kadamakudi with Pizhala Island and laid the foundation stone for the same. The residents have been requesting for a new bridge since the floods receded, as the existing concrete walkway bridge has been in a dilapidated condition for long, and it was recently declared unsafe even for pedestrian traffic by the PWD. The new bridge will be constructed adjacent to the existing bridge and will be 50 metres long and 3.5 metres wide. Vehicles up to 4 tons will be able to ply on this bridge, thus providing the much-needed connectivity to the villagers.  

The C-in-C was accompanied by Mrs Sapana Chawla, President, Navy Wives Welfare Association (Southern Region), and few other senior officers. Vice Admiral Chawla was taken around the new constructions and had a good interaction with the happy families. Mrs Chawla also distributed sweets to these families. 

The Rehabilitation Package was earlier announced by Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, Chief of the Naval Staff during his visit to Muttinakam in Aug 2018, and has been funded by the Indian Navy, which includes contributions from service personnel of Southern Naval Command.

                In a joint operation launched by Marine Task Force (MTF), Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and Anti-Terrorist Squad of Gujarat apprehended nine Iranian personnel along with 100 kilograms of narcotics off the coast of Gujarat on 26 March 2019. 

 

On 24 March 2019, inputs were received from ATS, Gujarat, regarding an illegal consignment of narcotic drug, heroin, likely to be smuggled in Gujarat through a Dhow ex-Iran. It also revealed that the consignment was loaded in Pakistan and destined for Gujarat. A team of ATS embarked Indian Coast Guard Ship for the mission while communication frequencies were constantly monitored by the ATS personnel. 

 

After extensive search of more than 24 hours, the suspicious Dhow was intercepted on 26 March 2019 by ICG ship off Gujarat coast. On being challenged the suspicious Dhow resorted to evasive tactics to avoid apprehension. On realising that apprehension by ICG was inevitable, the crew set the Dhow on fire to destroy the evidence. In a daring Joint Boarding Operation, the ICG and ATS team embarked the Dhow and apprehended nine Iranian crew alongwith recovery of 100 Kg of Heroine.   

 

The ICG ship thereafter, attempted to extinguish the fire on-board the Dhow however, due to presence of large quantity of fuel and few gas cylinders, the fire became uncontrollable and consequently the Dhow sank. The apprehended crew alongwith the consignment has been brought to Porbandar by Indian Coast Guard Ship and handed over to Marine Task Force (MTF), Gujarat AM 27 March 2019 for further action.

                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) today successfully conducted an Anti-Satellite (A-SAT) missile test ‘Mission Shakti’ from the Dr AP J Abdul Kalam Island in Odisha. A DRDO-developed Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) Interceptor Missile successfully engaged an Indian orbiting target satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in a ‘Hit to Kill’ mode. The interceptor missile was a three-stage missile with two solid rocket boosters. Tracking data from range sensors has confirmed that the mission met all its objectives.

The test has demonstrated the Nation’s capability to defend its assets in outer space. It is a vindication of the strength and robust nature of DRDO’s programmes.

With this India joins a select group of nations, which have such capability. The test has once again proven the capability of indigenous weapon systems.

                First Indian Army Mountaineering Expedition to Mt Makalu (8485m) comprising five Officers, two JCOs and eleven OR was flagged off by Director General Military Training on 26 Mar 2019. In furtherance of the objective of summiting all challenging peaks above 8000M, Indian Army is launching its maiden expedition to Mt Makalu in Mar-May 2019.



Mt Makalu is considered amongst the most dangerous peaks and summiting the peak is considered extremely challenging due to inclement weather conditions and freezing temperatures.

                Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM AVSM ADC, Chief of the Naval Staff commissioned a state of the art  ""Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Training Facility - ABHEDYA"", at  INS Shivaji, Lonavla today. The ceremony was attended by a host of dignitaries including VAdm AK Chawla, FOC-in-C Southern Naval Command, VAdm GS Pabby, Chief of Materiel &Cmde BB Nagpal CMD, GSL. 

M/s. GSL had signed the contract with Indian Navy for construction of NBCTF on 31 Mar 2016. In line with its tradition of delivering projects ahead of schedule, GSL has handed over the facility to Indian Navy on 28 Sep 2018, well ahead of schedule.

Cmde BB Nagpal CMD GSL stated “The timely completion of this Project is a reflection of the superior technical design and execution abilities of the Indian Navy and Goa Shipyard Limited. This unique facility will assist Indian Navy in providing realistic simulation of  Nuclear, Chemical & Biological warfare to its personnel during their NBC damage control training, which till now was limited to theoretical training largely.”

The steel structure of the simulator represents the relevant NBC compartment of the ship such as upper decks, citadels, cleansing stations, DCHQ, etc. The upper deck compartment is equipped with live agents along with NBC equipment such as SIRS, SICADS and other NBC detection and monitoring equipment. The trainees will have to detect, monitor, survey and decontaminate the areas using actual NBC equipment, providing real time NBC scenarios.

                Certain section of media is attempting to generate  motivated controversy on the NFFU/NFU for Armed Forces while the case is still subjudice in the Apex Court. The targeting of Govt officials ascribing false statements to them with an intent to pressurise them is highly condemnable. In case of complicated policies with long term and wider consequences, there may be times when agreement is not easy to build not  only between two parties but also within a party, such cases are debated for merit in judicial Courts as per the law of the land. This process must not be attempted to be highjacked by publically targeting the reputation of individuals discharging their duties as the authorised representatives of one side, GoI in this case. In the instant case, the recourse to judicial review was taken as per the existing policies and at the decision of the GoI. Certain facts have been twisted and misrepresented in media with the purpose of misleading uniformed community and the general public. One, the Central Pay Commission has been incorrectly quoted to have recommended NFFU/ NFU for the Armed Forces. Two, there has been no attempt to malign the uniformed community or quote them as staying in 'palatial houses' as the hardships faced by military fraternity are well known and deeply respected by everyone including those in the Govt. The counsel of GoI has only read out the recommendations of the 7th CPC as the argument of the case in the Apex Court. Three, the originators of smearing campaign have not spared even a uniformed veteran representing GoI in judicial matters but who has no connection with the instant case. Four, the delay is not at the behest of the Govt but because of the Apex Court asking the Govt to serve the notices to remaining petitioners so that they can also be heard.

MoD requests all to allow the legal procedure in the Apex Court to complete. It is reiterated that Govt stands by its uniformed fraternity and is custodian of its high morale and operational effectiveness.

                The HADR efforts by the Indian Navy in Mozambique have galvanised the local Indian Diaspora to work in tandem with the ships of the First Training Squadron of the Indian Navy (Sujata, Sarathi and Shardul) currently deployed there. 

The local community along with Indian Community has enthusiastically joined the HADR efforts being undertaken by the ships. The Rescue teams have voluntarily been provided vehicles by the Indian community for travel to affected areas and for coordination with the local authorities. The Indian Diaspora  have also organised local SIM cards for the teams so that effective communication is maintained while undertaking rescue work.  

During the ongoing operations at Port Beira since 18 Mar 19, the ships have rescued more than 192 survivors from Buzi area near Port Beira, which is cut off from the mainland. Three medical camps have been set up at Port Beira, Gaura-Gaurathe Island and Matadoura School, Imnhamizua and Medical assistance has been provided to over 1500 affected people from the local population.

The Chetak helicopter of Indian Navy has undertaken a number of sorties in difficult conditions for evacuation of local personnel in coordination with local authorities and the UN Mission. In addition, it has also dropped relief material (food and water) including that provided by World Food Programme. 

Community services are being undertaken by the ships crew at affected locations like schools, churches, hospitals, orphanages in coordination with the local government officials. The ships have setup a Community Kitchen kept open 24x7 for local populace including the workers at the port and 22 tons of fresh water has been provided to local authorities.



The HADR operations by the ships of the First Training Squadron are likely to continue at Port Beira till 30 Mar 19. INS Shardul is enroute to Maputo to embark relief material and will  return to Beira by 28 Mar to disembark relief material and also supply provisions to IN Ships. Meanwhile INS Magar, with relief stores being embarked at  Mumbai and is likely to depart for Beira 27/ 28 Mar 19 to alleviate the suffering of the cyclone affected population of Mozambique.

The indomitable spirit, humane approach and professionalism of the ships of the Training Squadron and the helicopter operations by the IN have received wide acknowledgement from the local government as well as the international agencies including the UN staff involved in HADR operations in Mozambique.

                In another inspring example of indigenisation of defence equipment, 5 Metre Short Span Bridge was formally handed over to the Indian Army on 20 March 2019 in a ceremony at the Talegaon facility of Larsen & Toubro Limited. The Bridge is indigenously designed & developed and is the result of close coordination between the Corps of Engineers and the DRDO laboratory at Pune R&DE (Engineers). The equipment has been manufactured by Larsen & Toubro Limited and has been delivered three months ahead of schedule.  All stakeholders have put in concerted efforts to overcome challenges and realise the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the government, which aims to ensure self sufficiency in our defence needs.

The Bridge will meet the important requirement of providing mobility to own forces by speedy establishment of bridges.  The Bridge is one of the numerous indigenous projects of Corps of Engineers which have made significant progress and are nearing induction and will soon join the units of Corps of Engineers.

                The ships of First Training Squadron of Indian Navy (Sujata, Sarathi and Shardul) operating in the Southern Indian Ocean were diverted to Port Beira, Mozambique based on request received from the Government of Mozambique to provide Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) to the local population post the devastation caused by cyclone 'IDAI' which struck the coast of Mozambique on 15 Mar 19. INS Sujata along with ICGS Sarathi arrived at Port Beira morning of 18 Mar 19 whilst INS Shardul arrived on 19 Mar 19 and are providing necessary support to the local administration.  Upon arrival at the port, the IN ships shifted from anchorage and berthed alongside taking advantage of the tide and commenced liaison work with local authorities immediately.

            Cyclone 'IDAI' made landfall at Beira, Mozambique in early hours of 15 Mar 19 causing widespread damage and loss of human life in the Central and Northern provinces of the country. Preliminary inputs indicate that city of Beira faced the maximum devastation with large scale damage to infrastructure. There are also reports of about 5000 personnel marooned at Buzi near Port Beira requiring immediate evacuation. The safe evacuation of the affected personnel by IN ships is being coordinated in consultation with local authorities. The disembarkation of HADR stores including food, medicines and clothing to the Mozambique Defence authorities has been completed. Arrangements are in progress to disembark potable water.

                        The Hon'ble Defence Minister of Mozambique visited IN ships to oversee the relief efforts. The Senior Officer of First Training Squadron, Capt Varun Singh, NM embarked onboard IN Ship Sujata has indicated to the Mozambique Navy that no effort would be spared by the IN ships in providing HADR/ SAR effort. The helicopter from IN Ship Shardul is operating from the local airport for reccee and SAR. The boats, Landing Craft Assault and Gemini rubberised craft with divers would be used to render assistance for evacuation of marooned personnel.

            The IN ships are likely to setup medical camps and provide food, water, blankets and other necessary relief items, as required by the local authorities. The situation is being monitored closely and the Indian Navy is prepared to render all necessary assistance to the local population in Mozambique.

                The Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, arrived Kochi on 18 March 19 for the debrief of the recently concluded annual Theatre Level Readiness and Operational Exercise (TROPEX). Commanders-in-Chief of all the three naval Commands, along with a number of senior operational commanders and representatives from Indian Army, Air Force and Indian Coast Guard attended and participated in the discussions held at the Naval Base, Kochi. 

The day long review of TROPEX 2019 was undertaken to examine the conduct of exercise and to assess operational readiness of the Indian Navy. A realistic audit of the Indian Navy’s deployment philosophy and fighting capability was undertaken during the review. Lessons learnt from the exercise will provide the Indian Navy accurate assessments to fine tune combat deployments, force structuring requirements, operational logistics as also material and training imperatives.

The Chief of Naval Staff while addressing the senior leadership and officers of the Navy congratulated them on the high level of professionalism and commitment displayed during the exercise. The CNS urged one and all to maintain the high tempo of operations and keep sharp vigil including stringent security measures to ensure safer coasts and secure seas. He stated that the Navy will always remain ready to protect, promote and preserve national interests in the maritime domain.

The Annual Integrated Theatre Level Operational Readiness Exercise - in short TROPEX - the largest maritime exercise of the Indian Navy was conducted in the month of February in the Arabian Sea and North Indian Ocean.  TROPEX 2019 was thus far the largest in terms of geographical extent covering the IOR, and also with regard to number of units participating. The exercise was conducted from 07 Jan 19 and graduated smoothly into providing the IN a high operational readiness posture post the Pulwama attack on 14 Feb 19. About 60 ships of Indian Navy, 12 ships of Indian Coast Guard and 60 aircraft participated in TROPEX 19. The exercise also included a Tri-services Amphibious Exercise that saw the participation of Army and Air Force personnel and assets. As a prelude to  TROPEX, the largest coastal defence exercise over codenamed ‘Sea Vigil’, was conducted on 22 and 23 Jan 19 with participation of all coastal states and union territories along with all maritime stake holders.

Overall, the exercise validated the Navy’s readiness and capability to meet various mandated roles, in support of national objectives.The Admiral departed Kochi, in the evening.

                The inaugural Africa-India Field Training Exercise-2019 for India and African nations called AFINDEX-19 scheduled from 18 March to 27 March 2019 started with a grand opening ceremony on 18 March 2019 at Aundh Military Station, Pune. Contingents of the 17 African Nations i.e. Benin, Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe came together for the opening ceremony alongwith a contingent of Maratha Light Infantry representing India.  Major General Sanjeev Sharma, General Officer Commanding, Golden Katar Division, who was the Chief Guest for the opening ceremony, reviewed the parade, in presence of a large number of Defence Attaches and other officials of participating nations. A fly past by a set of Advanced Light Helicopters and Cheetah Helicopter of the Indian Army carrying the flags of United Nations, India and the AFINDEX was the highlight of the opening ceremony. The Chief Guest and Defence Attaches from various nations interacted with the contingents after the completion of the parade.

                Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chief of the Naval Staff will be in Kochi tomorrow ( on 18 Mar) to preside over the debrief of largest War Game of the Indian Navy - the Theatre Level Operational Readiness Exercise (TROPEX 19). The exercise had commenced 07 Jan 19 and was planned to be terminated by 10 Mar 19. However, the JEM sponsored terrorist attack on the CRPF convoy in Pulwama on 14 Feb 19 led to the rapid redeployment of the Indian Navy for Operations in North Arabian sea. 

 

The major combat units of the Indian Navy including the Carrier Battle Group with INS Vikramaditya, nuclear submarines and scores of other ships, submarines and aircraft swiftly transited from exercise to operational deployment mode as tensions between India and Pakistan escalated. A clear and resolute message regarding the operational posture of the Indian Navy to prevent, deter and defeat any misadventure by Pakistan in the maritime domain was also issued during the tri-services press conference conducted on 28 Feb 19. 

 

About 60 ships of the Indian Navy, 12 ships of the Indian Coast Guard and 60 aircraft were part of TROPEX 19. Amongst the key attributes of Naval forces are the 'Versatility' to change roles, 'Mobility' and 'Poise'. Availability of such a large number of combat ready assets in the theatre of operations for TROPEX 19 allowed the Indian Navy to expeditiously respond to the developing situation in synergy with the three services. The overwhelming superiority of Indian Navy in all three dimensions forced the Pakistan Navy to remain deployed close to the Makran coast and not venture out in the open ocean. 

'

 Earlier, TROPEX 19 had commenced with Tri-services Amphibious Exercise in the A & N islands with participation of Army and Air Force. This was followed by the largest Coastal Defence Exercise code named SEA VIGIL' on 22 Jan and 23 Jan 19 with participation of all 13 Coastal States and Union Territories along with all maritime stakeholders. The TROPEX itself was thus far the largest in terms of geographical spread covering the IOR and also with regard to the number of participating units.

 

This day long review of TROPEX 19 by the Chief of the Naval Staff with all Operational Commander's is intended to examine the conduct of the exercise and to assess the operational preparedness of the Indian Navy. A realistic audit of the Indian Navy's deployment philosophy and fighting capability would also be undertaken. The lessons learnt from the exercise will provide the planners accurate assessments to fine tune force structuring requirements, operational logistics, as also material and training imperatives.

          The Omani contingent was represented by Jabel Regiment of the RAO while the Indian side was represented by troops of Tenth Battalion The Garhwal Rifles Regiment. Lt Col Muhammed Al Saidi, Second - in- Command, Jabel Regiment welcomed the Indian soldiers, and in his inaugural remarks highlighted the common shared beliefs of freedom, equality and justice that are precious to both nations. The magnificent opening ceremony conducted today started with briefing on Army Organization and Country Presentation by both countries.

          The Indian Army and RAO contingents have been specifically selected for the exercise based on expertise and professional competence and will take part in the two-week-long event that will see them hone their tactical and technical skills in joint counter insurgency and counter terrorist operations in semi-urban scenario in mountainous terrain under UN mandate. Due emphasis will be laid on increasing interoperability between forces from both countries which is crucial for success of any joint operation.  Both sides will jointly train, plan and execute a series of well-developed tactical drills for neutralization of likely threats that may be encountered in such a scenario. Experts from both sides will also hold detailed discussions to share their experience on varied topics for mutual benefit. Ex Al Nagah 2019 will contribute immensely in developing mutual understanding and respect for each other’s military as also facilitate in tackling the worldwide phenomenon of terrorism.

Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM AVSM ADC Chairman COSC and Chief of the Naval Staff is scheduled to visit UK on an official tour from 12 to 15 March 2019. The Indian Navy has had traditional links with the Royal Navy (RN) which have come a long way since institutionalisation of various defence forums for enhancing bilateral relationship between the two countries. With the constitution of the Indo-UK Defence Consultative Group (DCG) and the Military Sub Group (MSG) in 1995, a two-tier structure of cooperation was established to progress various areas of defence cooperation. In September 2004, the two countries inked a pact to embark upon a strategic partnership in which defence cooperation figured prominently. The ‘Service-level Staff Talks’ forum, officially referred to as ‘Executive Steering Group’ is the primary mechanism of enhancing cooperation between the two Armed Forces.

 

Indian Navy and Royal Navy are partners in the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), a Maritime Cooperation construct conceptualised and pioneered by Indian Navy in 2008. RN participated in the 10th anniversary celebrations of IONS at Kochi in November 2018. The bilateral naval exercise KONKAN is a significant operational link between the two navies and is held every year, alternately off the coast of India and UK. The two navies also interact on a host of issues like training, doctrinal concepts and Maritime Domain Awareness.

 

The upcoming visit of Admiral Sunil Lanba, the Chairman COSC and the Chief of the Naval Staff, Indian Navy to UK will consolidate existing maritime cooperation initiatives as well as explore new avenues. The Admiral’s visit to UK also aims to take forward the vision that was set forth during the visit of our Hon’ble PM to UK in November 2015.

 

During the three-day visit, Admiral Sunil Lanba is scheduled to hold discussions with the Chief of Defence Staff, UK in London and the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff of the Royal Navy at Portsmouth. Admiral Sunil Lanba is also scheduled to visit the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) in London, RN Submarine Rescue Facility at Glasgow and interact with the organisers of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo at Edinburgh.

                On the official visit to India, General Raymond Thomas, Commander US Special Operations Command, US Army, called on the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat. Both the Generals deliberated on the developing regional security environment, issue of global terrorism and Pakistan's continued support to terrorism was also discussed. Acknowledging India's role in peace and stability in the region, Gen Raymond emphasised on the need for further military cooperation in the field of technology and military to military exchanges between the two countries.

 

In the current scenario, Indian Army remains fully prepared for emerging challenges. In the last three weeks, disinformation campaign by the adversary on digital media has increased. All ranks have been well sensitised of these disinformation campaigns and all ranks can see through the lie, deceit & deception of the terror sponsors.

                Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr Subhash Bhamre on the occasion of Janaushadhi Diwas inaugurated a Janaushadhi Kendra at Base Hospital, Delhi Cantthere today. It will be a pilot Kendra, which is in line with Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP).  

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Bhamre said, “I would like to apprise you that Ministry of Defence [in June] last year had mandated that Janaushadhi Kendras to be empanelled with ECHS as Authorised Local Chemist (ALC) which will benefit the provisioning of medicines at much cheaper rate vis-a-vis market rate.”

It will also help the hospitals to procure bulk medicines for ECHS patients from the Janaushadhi Kendra as a registered vendor, leading to cost reduction in procurement of drugs through ECHS as well as DGLP funds. The speed of delivery will provide succour and greater satisfaction to veterans and their dependents.

Dr Bhamre acknowledged the efforts taken by DGMS (Army) & Colonel Commandant Lt Gen Manomoy Ganguly, present there on the occasion, to open the first Janaushadhi Kendra and also requested him to open more such outlets in other hospitals located across the country as soon as possible.

The Janaushadhi Kendras provide quality generic medicines at affordable costs for all. Presently there are 5,053 Janaushadhi Kendras in 652 districts providing quality generic medicines that are cheaper by 50-90 per cent as compared to average market price. This scheme has played a big role in bringing down the out of pocket expenditure of patients suffering from life threatening diseases in the country, leading to an approximate savings of Rs 1,000 crore of the people.

                Ministry of Defence has decided to grant ECHS facilities to World War II Veterans, Emergency Commissioned Officers (ECOs), Short Service Commissioned Officers (SSCOs) and pre-mature retirees. 

It is being proposed to waive the conditions relating to being ESM/in receipt of pension for grant membership of ECHS to World War II Veterans, ECOs, SSCOs and pre-mature retirees subject to the following conditions:

They must apply for membership of ECHS and accept the Rules of ECHS.ECHS facilities would be extended only to the individuals of the above-mentioned categories and their spouses. They will have to pay one-time contribution and become members of the ECHS. (However, war widows shall be exempt from payment of one-time ECHS contribution). They should not have been discharged on disciplinary grounds. They should not be covered under any other institutional health scheme of the Government.They should abide by the ECHS Rules as amended from time to time.The WW-II Veterans and ECOs and their spouses would be allowed all ECHS facilities including treatment in ECHS empanelled hospitals, and free OPD and IPD treatment facilities at the AFMS Hospitals, as available to other ECHS members.The SSCOs and pre-mature retirees and their spouses would be eligible for the following facilities:


	
	
		
		
			Free OPD services from ECHS Polyclinics
			They must pay for OPD/IPD/Investigations in ECHS empanelled hospitals and seek reimbursement @ 75 per cent of total admissible expenditure for personnel having more than 10 years of service and @ 50 per cent of total admissible expenditure for personnel having less than or equal to 10 years of service. 
		
		
	
	


It may be noted that there has been a long pending demand from the World War II Veterans, Emergency Commissioned Officers (ECOs), and Short Service Commissioned Officers (SSCOs) for grant of ECHS facilities.There are precedents when the conditions of ECHS membership have been waived due to special circumstances with the approval of CCS in the past. (For example, in the cases of Uniformed Coast Guard pensioners, Defence Security Corps, Assam Rifles, etc.). The Raksha Mantri’s Committee of Experts has recommended in its report that SSCOs and ECOs and all other personnel released without the benefit of pension but on completion of terms with gratuity be granted ECHS facilities. 

The total annual financial implication would be about Rs21.28crore per year plus Rs94.30 lakh per annum due to members added every year. In addition, the financial implication would increase to the extent of number of pre-mature retirements taking place in subsequent years.Expected number of beneficiaries going to be around 43,000.

                Misinformation on the shooting of Pakistan Air Force F-16 by MiG-21 Bison are being spread on various social media sites. IAF during the press statement on 28 Feb 19 had clarified that one F-16 of Pakistan Air Force was shot by MiG-21 Bison and it fell across the LoC. Additionally fake accounts of Wing Commander V Abhinandan have been created in the last one week.

                Post our warning to the Pakistan Army “NOT to target civilian areas”, the overall situation along the Line of Control remains relatively calm. In the last 24 hours, the Pakistan Army resorted to intense & unprovoked firing with heavy caliber weapons in selected areas of Krishna Ghati and Sunderbani, targeting Indian posts & civilian areas with Mortar bombs & heavy Arty Guns. The same was effectively retaliated by the Indian Army. There have been no casualties on the Indian side.

We would reiterate that as a professional Army we are committed to avoid civil casualties, especially along the Line of Control. All actions taken by our defence forces are targeted towards counter terrorism and terrorist infrastructure, away from civilian areas, to avoid civilian casualties.

We are maintaining strict vigil along the Line of Control and IB. Any further provocation or misadventure by Pakistan will be responded in a befitting manner with dire consequences.

                In the morning of 27 Feb 19, our Air Defence system was on full alert. Build up of PAF aircraft on their side of LoC was noticed in time and additional aircraft were scrambled to tackle the adversary. In their attempt to attack our ground targets, PAF aircraft were engaged effectively.  From IAF side, Mirage-2000, Su-30 and MiG-21 Bison aircraft were involved in the engagement. PAF aircraft were forced to withdraw in a hurry, which is also evident from large missed distances ofthe weapons dropped by them.  During combat, use of F-16 by PAF and multiple launches of AMRAAM were conclusively observed. Prompt and correct tactical action by Su-30 aircraft, in response to AMRAAM launch, defeated the missile. Parts of the missile fell in area East of Rajouri in J&K, injuring a civilian on ground. Detailed report in this regard has already been released by IAF.  All the Su-30 aircraft engaged in combat landed back safely.  False claim by Pakistan of shooting down a Su-30, appears to be a cover up for loss of its own aircraft..

                Ministry of Defence has taken steps to ensure implementation of announcement by the Prime Minister on 15th August, 2018 regarding grant of Permanent Commission to Women officers in the Armed Forces.

In so far the Indian Air Force is concerned, all Branches, including Fighter Pilots are now open for women officers.

In Indian Navy all non sea going Branches/Cadre/Specialisation have been opened for induction of women officers through Short Service Commission. In addition to education, Law & Naval Constructor branch/cadre, women SSC officers have been made eligible for grant of Permanent Commission in the Naval Armament branch, at par with the male officers.

The proposal for induction of three new training ships for the Indian Navy is underway. This will provide the requisite infrastructure for training of both men and women officers. Indian Navy will start inducting women in all branches, once the training ships are in place.

 Women officers will be granted Permanent Commission in the Indian Army in all the ten branches where women are inducted for Short Service Commission. So, besides the existing two streams of Judge Advocate General (JAG) and Army Education Corps, now PC will be granted in Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Army Air Defence, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Army Service Corps, Army Ordinance Corps and Intelligence also to women officers. SSC women officers will give their option for PC before completion of four years of Commissioned Service and they will exercise option for grant of PC and their choice of specialisation.

SSC Women officers will be considered for grant of PC based on suitability, merit etc and will be employed in various staff appointment.

                              As was stated during the Joint Press Conference on 28 Feb 19, the Indian Navy remains deployed as necessary to protect National Maritime Interests.

            Over the past several days, we have witnessed Pakistan indulging in false propaganda and spread of misinformation. The Indian Navy does not take cognizance of such propaganda. Our deployments remain undeterred.

                Exercise Al Nagah III, third in the series of bilateral joint exercise between India and Oman is scheduled to be held from 12 to 25 March 2019 at Jabel Al Akhdar Mountains in Oman. The exercise will see both the armies exchanging expertise and experience in tactics, weapon handling and firing, with an aim to enhance interoperability in counterterrorist operations in semi urban mountainous terrain.

India-Oman bilateral security ties have continued to develop since the beginning of India-Oman Joint Military Cooperation meetings in 2006.  Exercise Al Nagah III follows the first two joint exercises that were held in Oman in January 2015 and India in March 2017 respectively.  Similar exercises are also in vogue between the navies and air forces of both the nations thus underscoring the growing bilateral military and strategic partnership between the two important nations of Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

The Indian Army contingent is going to be represented by 04 Officers, 09 Junior Commissioned Officers and 47 other ranks of 10th Battalion of the Garhwal Rifles. Similar strength is also to be fielded by Jabel Regiment of Royal Army of Oman (RAO).  Observer delegation comprising senior officers of both the armies will witness the validation exercise to be held on 25 March 2019.  The exercise will go a long way in enchaining understanding of capabilities and strengthening camaraderie between both the Armies.

                Indian Naval Ship Sharda, based at Kochi, rescued five fishermen at sea who were floating in the water after their fishing vessel, FV Omkaram, sank, some 35 km North West of Azhikal port, on 04 Mar 19. The incident occurred at around 09:30 AM when the ship was on patrol in the area.

 

An alert lookout sighted a movement in the water, which turned out to be the five floating fishermen. The ship acted with alacrity and immediately altered course towards the survivors. It thereafter lowered its life boats and successfully rescued and brought on board all five fishermen within ten minutes of the initial sighting. Two of the fishermen had sustained minor injuries and were administered first aid by the Ship’s Medical Team. The ship thereafter headed for Kochi to disembark the survivors.

 

The rescued fishermen have indicated that they had cast off from Cheruvathur in Kasargod at 04:00 AM on 04 Mar 19. As per them, water started entering their 13 feet boat, which they were unable to control, and the heavy flooding ultimately caused the boat to sink. The fishermen had to remain afloat without any life saving devices from 06:30 AM till the time they were rescued. They were out of mobile range and were unable to swim or to seek help from other boats. They said that they had removed their clothes to wave at the ship and had almost lost hope of being rescued. All the survivors Manoharan (56) (Boat Owner), Vasav (57), Chandran (60), Suresh (42), Surendran (49) belong to Kanjanghad, Kasargod. The survivors were provided food, water and fresh clothing by the ship’s crew. Efforts are on to inform their next of kin as well as Trikkaripur local coastal police station.

 

   INS Sharda is an offshore Patrol Vessel of the Indian Navy and presently in its 26th year of commission. The ship is actively deployed for coastal surveillance and patrolling off Kerala and Lakshadweep islands and has also undertaken regular anti-piracy deployments in the Gulf of Aden. The ship was earlier too involved in rescue of 21 fishermen during Cyclone Ockhi and was also used for distribution of relief material during Op Madad, which was launched by the Southern Naval Command, at the time of the Kerala floods. The ship is presently commanded by Commander R Anoop.

                          As part of the ongoing India Bangladesh defence cooperation, a joint military exercise Sampriti-2019 is being conducted at Tangail, Bangladesh from 02 March to 15 March 2019.  The eighth edition of Exercise Sampriti, commenced at the Bongobondhu Cantonment, Tangail Bangladesh with an impressive opening ceremony on 03 March 2019. The participating contingents marched in and stood side by side and gave a ceremonial salute to the national flags of both the countries to the strains of “Jana Gana Mana” and the “Amar Shonar Bangla”. 

 

          The Bangladesh contingent was represented by 36 East Bengal Battalion, while Indian side was represented by 9th Battalion the Rajputana Rifles. Major General Mizanur Rahman Shamim, General Officer Commanding, 19 Infantry Division, Bangladesh Army welcomed the Indian contingent and in his inaugural remarks highlighted the common shared beliefs of democracy, freedom, equality and justice that are precious to both the nations. 

 

          The aim of the exercise is to increase mutual cooperation, bonhomie and camaraderie between the two armies through interoperability and joint tactical exercises.  A company group from Bangladesh Army and an equal number from Indian Army are taking part in the two-week long exercise that will see them hone their tactical and technical skills in countering insurgency, counter terrorism and aid to civil authorities for disaster management in an UN peace keeping scenario involving a combined deployment at a battalion level. 

 

          In this eighth edition of the exercise which started way back in 2009 as a platoon level exercise and graduated to company level exercise in 2015 onwards, both sides will jointly train, plan and execute a series of well developed tactical drills for neutralisation of likely threats that may be encountered during simulated UN peace keeping operations. The experts from both the sides will also hold discussions to share each other’s experiences in varied topics for mutual benefits.

            In continuation of the process of engaging the global strategic community in an annual review of India’s opportunities and challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, the second edition of Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue (IPRD) - 2019 will be held on 05 and 06 March 2019 at the Manekshaw Centre, New Delhi. This dialogue will build upon the foundation laid by the inaugural edition and will examine five fresh themes: (i) Practical solutions for achieving cohesion in the region through maritime connectivity; (ii) measures to attain and maintain a free-and-open Indo-Pacific; (iii) a regional approach to the region’s transition from a ‘Brown’ to a ‘Blue’ economy; (iv) opportunities and challenges arising from the maritime impact of ‘Industry 4.0’; and (v) how the twin conceptualisations of ‘SAGAR’ and ‘SAGARMALA’ might best be made mutually-reinforcing on a regional level.  These themes would be addressed in five sessions spread over two days, with three of the sessions being steered as panel-discussions, which would encourage a freer flow of ideas and views and ensure greater audience-interaction. 

 

            The response to this year’s dialogue has been highly encouraging and
IPRD-2019 is likely to witness active participation of globally-renowned domain experts and policy-makers from thirteen countries of the Indo-Pacific — Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Seychelles, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.  The Honourable Raksha Mantri, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, the Honourable Minister for Road Transport and Highways; Shipping and Water Resources; River Development; and Ganga Rejuvenation — Shri Nitin Jairam Gadkari, the Honourable Minister of Commerce and Industry; and Civil Aviation — Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu, are scheduled to address the audience before the conduct of the professional sessions.  

 

            Through this annual dialogue, the Indian Navy and the National Maritime Foundation, aim to provide a platform for substantive and insightful discussions pertaining to the geopolitical developments affecting the maritime domain of the Indo-Pacific, and provide policy-relevant inputs to the policy-makers and the public at large.

 

 

            The idea of an Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue (IPRD) was first conceptualised and conducted in 2018, as the apex level conference of the Indian Navy, organised by the National Maritime Foundation as the Navy’s Knowledge Partner. The permanent theme of this annual dialogue is a review of India’s opportunities and challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.  The aim is to focus attention on the Indo-Pacific, as a maritime geographical-entity, while deliberating aspects of great relevance to regional geopolitics. The 2018 edition of the IPRD sought to highlight the opportunities that lay before India’s maritime policy-shapers, policy-makers, and, the practitioners of the country’s maritime policies.  This first edition dwelt upon four basic themes: (i) The growth, opportunities and vulnerabilities of maritime merchandise trade, including associated infrastructure such as ports and multi-modal connectivity, as seen from the very different perspectives of large and small littoral and island nations; (ii) Regional connectivity-models; (iii) Pan-regional challenges such as sustaining persistent surveillance at sea, the increasing digitisation of the maritime space, the dangers of cyber-malevolence that are already afflicting the maritime domain, etc.; (iv) the role of Indian industry within both, the private and the public sectors, in enhancing holistic maritime-security.  The 2018 Dialogue was a resounding success, with 15 analytical papers presented by renowned strategists and analysts from across the globe, in five sessions, spread over two days.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh dedicated two Inter-State road projects in the North-Eastern Region, through video conferencing at a function here today. The 17.47 kms long Doimukh-Harmuti Road links Assam and Arunachal Pradesh while the 1.66 km Tura-Mankachar Road provides connectivity between Assam and Meghalaya.

            Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the inauguration of the two roads marks a reiteration of the Government’s commitment to development of the North-Eastern Region (NER). He said the North-East has undergone a revolutionary transformation in the last five years under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The Prime Minister has paid several visits to the NER demonstrating his indulgence towards the NER, he added.

            Pointing out that the NER faced a unique challenge as the region lacked Intra-Regional Connectivity compared to connectivity with the rest of the country, Dr. Jitendra Singh said Inter-State connectivity in the North-East suffered on account of negligence. Union Government has given focus to revival of such “orphan roads”, he added. 

Dr. Jitendra Singh said due to intervention of the Central Government, there has been a visible transformation in rail, road and air connectivity in the NER. Two North-Eastern States, - Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, have been brought on the rail map. Besides, the Bogibeel Rail-cum-Road Bridge in Assam, the longest rail-cum-road bridge on Brahmaputra river, was inaugurated on December 25, 2018 and the new Greenfield Airport at Pakyong (Gangtok), first Airport in Sikkim inaugurated on September 24, 2018, has been constructed at a cost of Rs. 553.5 Crores. Dr. Jitendra Singh said improved connectivity and infrastructure has removed bottlenecks in the development process, giving boost to the region’s economy and promoting industry. The improved infrastructure will lead to job creation, which in turn is expected to arrest migration of the youth, he added.

The construction work for both the roads inaugurated today has been implemented by the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL). The Doimukh-Harmuti Inter-State Road has been constructed under the North East Road Sector Development Scheme (NERSDS) at a cost of Rs. 58.25 Crores. The  length of road in Assam is  7.87 Km and remaining 9.60 Kms in Arunachal Pradesh. The construction of the road was started in September, 2017 and completed in January, 2019. The road was funded by the North-Eastern Council (NEC) under Ministry of DoNER, Government of India. The road will provide an alternative connectivity to Itanagar and immensely benefit the people residing in Papum Pare district of Arunachal Pradesh in general and the people of the capital region in particular.

Tura-Mankachar Road is the first road which have been completed under the NERSDS. The construction of the road was started in September, 2017 and completed in June, 2018. This road has also been funded by NEC at a cost of Rs. 4.71 Crores. The road provides an alternative connectivity to Tura and will immensely benefit the people residing in the West Garo Hills District of Meghalaya.

Both roads are designed as two lane carriage ways to cater the traffic load of 10 MSA (Million Standard Axles).

                Recent media reports in the Hindustan Times and Scroll.in have questioned the findings of the National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey conducted under the World Bank supported “Swachh Bharat Mission Support Operation”, questioning the sufficiency of the sample size and the adequacy of training of enumerators.These reports are factually incorrect, misleading and biased.

The NARSS2018-19 is the largest independent sanitation survey in the country to data, with a sampling framework that covers more than six thousand villages, 92040 households, and 5782 schools, 5803 Anganwadi Centers, 1015 Public toilets and 6055 Public spaces,making itthe most representative sanitation survey in the country.The selection of villages, as well as households within each village is random, and statistically significant and the village, State and national level. 

The methodology and processes of the NARSShave been developed and approved by an empowered and independent Expert Working Group comprising leading experts on statistics and sanitation which include Prof. Amitabh Kundu, Dr N. C Saxena, World Bank, UNICEF, BMGF, Water Aid India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), among others. This group has overseen and participated in the conduct of the NARSS, from questionnaire design to sampling to training of enumerators to the actual questioning in the field. 

The NARSS followed a robust quality assurance mechanism through accompaniment and back check of enumerators by their supervisors and members of the EWG, during and post the survey period to re-validate the data collected. Over 5% of the total sample was back checked to ensure that the findings are credible. This level of rigor and neutrality by external experts makes the NARSS data the most credible data available on sanitation in India. 

These media reports have used other statistically insignificant, non-representative and biased studiesfrom varying timeframes to cast aspersions on the findings of the NARSS.The report on Scroll.in has in fact quoted data from NARSS 2017-18 instead of NARSS 2018-19, misrepresenting it as the present sanitation coverage in rural India. It would have been appropriate for the authors to read the NARSS Protocol document,as well as the results of the survey from 2017-18 and 2018-19 whichareall available in the public domain, before making sweeping remarks on its methodology and robustness.

                On the occasion of World Water Day on 22nd March 2019, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation  organised a two day National Workshop on Management of Grey Water in Rural Areas and Arsenic and Fluoride Remediation (March 21, 22) in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)  Madras with support from UNICEF India. 

The plenary session of the Workshop was addressed by Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and Director, IIT Madras Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthy. Highlights of the first day and proceeding of the second day of the Workshop are as under.

Speaking at the workshop, Secretary Shri Iyer said that after achieving good sanitation coverage under Swachh Bharat Mission,  the country is transiting from ODF (Open Defecation Free) to ODF+ status and to sustain ODF status. Significant research and technology inputs are required to have standards for grey water discharge, and local level manageable low cost solutions for its  management. The workshop included discussions on the need for integration of policy, research, technology and skill development for effective grey water management in rural areas. 

On Day 2, an overview and policy aspects on water affected with arsenic and fluoride were presented, including policy level interventions to address the arsenic and fluoride contamination, health effects and communication strategies for creating awareness at community level about the adverse effects of these contaminations.

The session on greywater policy discussed the international and national and policies on grey water and its relevance to Indian context. Emphasis was made on setting standards for grey water reuse for agriculture and groundwater recharge.

Various technologies, ranging from a simple soak pits, phyto-remedition to membrane based grey water treatment were discussed. It was emphasised that the technologies to be adopted in rural areas need to be simple, require less skill level for construction, operation and maintenance.

In the States' session, State Governments of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Telangana, Punjab presented their experience on managing the grey water in rural areas. Accessing financial resources by integrating different schemes for construction of grey water recharge structures and beneficial health and economic aspects were highlighted.

The technologies session for arsenic and fluoride contamination focussed on different available technologies to remove localised arsenic/fluoride like terra fill to advanced ones like nano technology based solutions, membrane technologies and community based approach for fluoride remediation. Five States affected with arsenic/fluoride - West Bengal, Tamilnadu, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan - made presentations on strategied to provide contaminant free potable water.

                The National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) 2018-19, conducted by an Independent Verification Agency (IVA) under the World Bank support project to the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen (SBM-G), has found that 96.5% of the households in rural India who have access to a toilet use it. The NARSS also re-confirmed the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status of 90.7% of villages which were previously declared and verified as ODF by various districts/States. The survey was conducted between November 2018 and February 2019 and covered 92040 households in 6136 villages across States and UTs of India.

The key findings of NARSS 2018-19 are as follows:


	
	93.1% of households were found to have access to toilets during the survey period (the corresponding figure as per the SBMG MIS in November 2018 was 96%)
	
	
	96.5% of the people who had access to toilets used them
	
	
	90.7% of villages which were previously declared and verified as ODF were confirmed to be ODF. The remaining villages also had sanitation coverage of about 93%
	
	
	95.4% of the villages surveyed found to have minimal litter and minimal stagnant water
	


The IVA presented their findings to the Expert Working Group (EWG) constituted for oversight of NARSS, comprising representatives from organizations including the World Bank, UNICEF, Water Aid, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, India Sanitation Coalition, NITI Aayog, and Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation. The EWG noted the satisfactory completion of the survey round 2 (for 2018-19, after last year’s NARSS 2017-18). Following this, the IVA submitted their provisional summary results report and raw data to the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, and the same have been uploaded and made publicly accessible on the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation website (mdws.nic.in).

The survey used the PPS (Probability Proportion to Size) sampling methodology, which yields results within a confidence interval of 95%. Data was collected using the Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) platform. The survey also covered schools, anganwadis and public/community toilets in these villages.

Since its launch in October 2014, the SBM, the world’s largest sanitation program, has changed the behaviour of hundreds of millions of people with respect to toilet access and usage. 500 million people have stopped defecating in the open since the SBM began, down from 550 million at the beginning of the programme to less than 50 million today. Over 9 crore toilets have been built across rural India under the Mission. Over 5.5 lakh villages and 615 districts have been declared ODF, along with 30 ODF States and Union Territories.

                The Ministry of Human Resource Development has not issued any directive to restrict choice of subjects for research, as has been reported in a section of media since the Government believes in the principle of freedom in research. 

Last year, there was a meeting of Vice Chancellors of 11 Central Universities, which were lacking in research. In the said meeting they presented a road map to improve research and also discussed the issue of more research on issues relating to national priorities. The minutes of the meeting were recorded.

The Government has given impetus to improve and expand research facilities. The Government has provided Rs 480 crore for Social Science Research Project under Impactful Policy Research in Social Sciences (IMPRESS); Rs 225 Crore for research in basic sciences; Rs 1000 crore under Impacting Research, Innovation and Technology (IMPRINT) for technology related research; Rs 450 crore under STRIDE for research in Humanities; and Rs 480 crore under Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) for joint research with foreign universities in any discipline.

                Today CSC SPV organized a National workshop on “Celebrating 2 Crore PM-JAY and 1000 Digital Villages” at the India Habitat Centre in New Delhi.

Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon’ble Minister of Electronics & IT and Law & Justicewhile inaugurating the event, appreciated the efforts of the CSC VLEs and said, “Recently, Hon’ President of India and Hon’ Prime Minister appreciated CSCs’ efforts. In last 4 years, our VLEs have become change agent of rural India. I feel proud that we have 67,463 women VLEs in India.” He also launched the completion of 1000 Digital Villages and congratulated HDFC for supporting in Digital Village initiative. “CSCs will become case studies in Harvard like global institutions very soon. Once, Hon’ PM said that I want to see the governance on the palm of every citizen and I can see it in villages of our country.” He asked VLEs to complete the registrations in Ayushman Bharat to 5 crore in next two months. “I wish the Village Level Entrepreneurs of CSC all the best and hope they will truly be the harbingers of digital revolution in India and enable us to create digitally and financially inclusive society. I and my government will always support CSCs in enabling delivery of services.”  

CSC SPV and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare have partnered to implement the Ayushman Bharat scheme through the CSC network across the country. Under the partnership CSCs will help the beneficiary to identify his/her name in the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare database and his/her entitlement for the scheme. CSCs will also help beneficiary to scan/upload his/her KYC documents for verification of his/her identity and claim his/her entitlement. The Beneficiary will have facility to print his/her Ayushman Scheme card through CSC. Hence, CSCs will also provide requisite information about the scheme and promote it among citizens, so that maximum number of beneficiaries can avail the benefit.

As part of their social responsibility, HDFC has collaborated with CSC SPV to transform and develop villages and hamlets across the country as Digital Villages, which enables rural citizens to access G2C, education, health and financial services. 

CSC SPV is implementing the Digital Village Programme (Digi Gaon) in rural and remote areas of the country, with the mandate of the Ministry of Electronics & IT, where citizens can avail of various online services of the central and State government, and private players alike. These Digital villages are positioned to be the change agents, promoting rural entrepreneurship and livelihood through community participation. 

These Digital Villages have been equipped with solar lighting facility in their community center, LED Bulb assembly unit, sanitary napkin unit, and Wi-fi Choupal; an initiative towards developing a Rural Wi-Fi infrastructure. These villages would also have the regular online services available through the Common Services Center like G2C and B2C, Banking and Insurance, Health, Education and other utility services of the State government.

                In a significant first, India piloted resolutions on two important global environment issues relating to Single-use Plastics and Sustainable Nitrogen management at the fourth session of United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) which was held in Nairobi from 11th to 15th March 2019.UNEA adopted both the resolutions with consensus. The theme of the UNEA this year was Innovative Solutions for environmental challenges and sustainable production and consumption. 

The global nitrogen use efficiency is low, resulting in pollution by reactive nitrogen which threatens human health, eco system services, contributes to climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion. Only a small proportion of the plastics produced globally are recycled with most of it damaging the environment and aquatic bio-diversity. Both these are global challenges and the resolutions piloted by India at the UNEA are vital first steps towards addressing these issues and attracting focus of the global community. 

India also hosted, in the High-Level Segment of UNEA, a session on “Global Partnerships: Key to Unlocking Resource Efficiency and Inclusive Green Economies”. The side event was attended by representatives of Member States, Civil Society Organizations, private sector organizations including leading financial institutions. The Side Event had a panel discussion which had High Level diplomatic participation from Germany, Brazil, South Africa and senior management of international financial institutions. The mainstreaming of resource efficiency and use of secondary raw materials through partnerships and action at scale is critical for moving towards green economy. 

It emerged that collaborations and action at scale is key to success. The actions should be oriented towards having an inclusive green economy and blended finance will help in implementation whereas public finance should be provided to de-risk private finance in transformational projects.  

The Indian delegation also participated in the panel discussion in High Level Segment on “Need for additional commitments of public finance and the ways to maximize mobilization of climate finance”. 

It was highlighted that climate finance is an important lever for climate action related to both mitigation and adaption in the developing countries. The contributions to climate finance need to be in consonance with the basic principles of common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). Climate finance is more of an obligation of the developed countries, based on their historical emissions. The availability of sufficient, additional and predictable climate finance is a key for action.  Importantly, the lack of pledged funds in Green Climate Fund and the potential reliance on private sector has been highlighted by many developing countries.  India has been initiating domestic climate actions, both related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, primarily through its own financial resources. There is a sense of urgency for financial support to developing countries, which have not been so responsible for these global environmental concerns.

                India is one of the first countries in the world to develop a comprehensive Cooling Action plan which has a long term vision to address the cooling requirement across sectors and lists out actions which can help reduce the cooling demand. Cooling requirement is cross sectoral and an essential part for economic growth and is required across different sectors of the economy such as residential and commercial buildings, cold-chain, refrigeration, transport and industries

 

Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan released the India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP) today in a function in New Delhi. The Environment Minister said that the thrust of the India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP) is to look for synergies in actions for securing both environmental and socio-economic benefits. “The overarching goal of ICAP is to provide sustainable cooling and thermal comfort for all while securing environmental and socio-economic benefits for the society. This will also help in reducing both direct and indirect emissions.” said Dr. Vardhan.

 

The minister further stated that the India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP) provides an integrated vision towards cooling across sectors encompassing inter alia reduction of cooling demand, refrigerant transition, enhancing energy efficiency and better technology options with a 20 year time horizon.

 

The India Cooling Action seeks to (i) reduce cooling demand across sectors by 20% to 25% by 2037-38, (ii) reduce refrigerant demand by 25% to 30% by 2037-38, (iii) Reduce cooling energy requirements by 25% to 40% by 2037-38, (iv)  recognize “cooling and related areas” as a thrust area of research under national S&T Programme, (v) training and certification of 100,000 servicing sector technicians by 2022-23, synergizing with Skill India Mission. These actions will have significant climate benefits. 

 

The following benefits would accrue to the society over and above the environmental benefits: (i) Thermal comfort for all – provision for cooling for EWS and LIG housing, (ii) Sustainable cooling – low GHG emissions related to cooling, (iii) Doubling Farmers Income – better cold chain infrastructure – better value of produce to farmers, less wastage of produce, (iv) Skilled workforce for better livelihoods and environmental protection, (v) Make in India – domestic manufacturing of air-conditioning and related cooling equipment’s, (vi) Robust R&D on alternative cooling technologies – to provide push to innovation in cooling sector. 

 

Cooling is also linked to human health and productivity. Linkages of cooling with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are well acknowledged. The cross-sectoral nature of cooling and its use in development of the economy makes provision for cooling an important developmental necessity. The development of ICAP has been a multi-stakeholder inclusive process encompassing different Government Ministries/Departments/Organizations, Industry and Industry Associations, Think tanks, Academic and R&D institutions.

                It has come to notice that some unscrupulous elements have been spreading the message among farmers in the NCR that use of diesel agriculture pumps have been banned by the Hon’ble National Green Tribunal (NGT).  They are apparently harassing the farmers and forcing them to buy new pumps.  There has been no such order so far by Hon’ble NGT and it is clarified that Hon’ble NGT vide its order dated April 07, 2015 in OA No. 95 / 2014 had directed that all diesel vehicles (heavy or light) which are more than 10 years old, will not be permitted on the roads of National Capital Region(NCR), Delhi.

Therefore, it is made abundantly clear that aforesaid order relates to diesel vehicles and not to agriculture pumps using diesel.

This is also for the information of all State Governments and the enforcement agencies to make sure that such misinformation campaign should not be allowed to continue and to ensure that farmers are not harassed.

                Income Tax Department carried out search actions at 5 premises located in and around Srinagar on 28th March, 2019. Two groups, which connived with local officials in facilitation of absorption of undisclosed income of undesirable elements in shops, buildings and land in Srinagar were searched.

It has been found in the search that 76 shops built by Srinagar Development Authority for resettlement of vegetable and fruit vendors were sold off to influential and cash rich disrupters at a huge premium. One of the persons searched by the Department is a self-proclaimed chairman of the Vegetable Vendors Union, Batamaloo. The magnitude and proportion of black money used in these transactions is startling. It has been found that four shops on the first floor of the market have been apparently sold by the self-styled chairman for Rs 1.09 crore to an individual, who paid Rs 9 lakh in cheque and the balance Rs 1 crore in unaccounted cash. He has constructed a three-storeyed budget hotel-cum-shopping complex at the New Fruit Complex, Parimpora, from black money earned by him in transactions of these shops and other real estate.

The second search operation revealed that nearly 86 Kanals of land under unauthorised occupation was sold to locally powerful persons at a high premium. The transactions have been undertaken either completely or largely in undisclosed cash. A number of original ‘ikrarnamas’ have been found and seized, that show possession of land being passed on in exchange of unaccounted receipt of cash. The said tax evader set up a scrap and plastic crushing unit out of the cash generated in this manner. The investment in this unit as well as income earned from it has been totally kept out of the tax net.

In the aggregate, the search actions of 28th March, 2019 have unearthed unaccounted financial transactions of more than Rs 11 crore and undeclared investment in immoveable property of more than Rs 19 crore in and around Srinagar.

None of the persons covered in the search actions has filed an income tax return. Criminal prosecution for wilful attempt to evade tax as well as deliberate non-filing of tax returns would be filed against the tax evaders.

                Dr. Krishnamurty Subramanium, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Government of India and Cadre Head of the Indian Economic Service (IES) asks the IES officers to keep themselves updated and skilled with tools and techniques concerning econometrics, data analytics and effective visualization among others. He also emphasized the need of sharing of experiences and best practices regularly on a common platform amongst IES officers. CEA Dr Subramanium was speaking during his interaction with the IES officers yesterday in the national capital. The interaction was half-a-day long Brain-storming Session on enhancing the effective contribution of IES officers to the Economic Policy making and its implementation in the country. More than 130 IES officers, who are posted at different levels in various Ministries and Departments of the Government of India, participated in the said Session. 

It was agreed that IES officers can contribute more effectively to the policy space by making all advice to the Government evidence-based, objectively communicating the policies of the Government, and widening the scope of engagement of IES officers to parastatals and the State Government services. To this end, CEA emphasized that IES officers need to be updated and skilled with tools and techniques relating to econometrics, data analytics & effective visualization among others. As the importance of specialization in policymaking is increasing constantly, IES officers need to constantly engage with academia and the private sector to provide sharp economic analysis. The CEA also advocated continuous learning through training programs in India and abroad in the best academic institutions and combining them with effective use of the advantages provided by the online training courses.

IES officers expressed their gratitude to the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance - for the growth and reach of IES officers to the Senior Levels in the Government of India.

                India and the United States of America have today, the 27th March, 2019, signed an Inter-Governmental Agreement for Exchange of Country-by-Country (CbC) Reports. The Agreement was signed by Shri P.C.Mody, Chairman, Central Board of Direct Taxes and Mr. Kenneth I. Juster, Ambassador of the United States of America to India on behalf of the two countries. This Agreement for Exchange of CbC Reports, alongwith the Bilateral Competent Authority Arrangement between the two Competent Authorities, will enable both the countries to automatically exchange CbC Reports filed by the ultimate parent entities of Multinational Enterprises (“MNEs”) in the respective jurisdictions, pertaining to the years commencing on or after 1st January, 2016. It would also obviate the need for Indian subsidiary companies of US MNEs to do local filing of the CbC Reports, thereby reducing the compliance burden.

India has already signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) for Exchange of CbC Reports, which has enabled exchange of CbC Reports with 62 jurisdictions.

Filing of CbC Reports by the ultimate parent entity of an MNE group to the prescribed Authority in the jurisdiction in which it is a resident and exchange of such CbC Reports by the Competent Authority of the said jurisdiction with the Competent Authorities of other jurisdictions in which the group has one or more of its constituent entities, are the minimum standards required under the Action 13 Report of OECD/G20 BEPS Project in which India is an active participant.

A CbC Report has aggregated country-by-country information relating to the global allocation of income, the taxes paid, and certain other indicators of an MNE group. It also contains a list of all the constituent entities of an MNE group operating in a particular jurisdiction and the nature of the main business activity of each such constituent entity. MNE groups having global consolidated revenue of 750 Million Euros or more (or a local currency equivalent) in a year are required to file CbC Reports in their parent entity’s jurisdiction. The INR equivalent of 750 Million Euros has been prescribed as INR 5500 Crore in Indian rules. This information will enable an enhanced level of assessment of tax risk by both tax administrations.

                 A search action under Section 132 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 was carried-out on Sh. D.K Shivakumar and Group of Cases on 2nd August, 2017 by the Income Tax Investigation Directorate of Karnataka & Goa. A large evidence of incriminating material against Shri D. K Shivakumar and his company were found.

During the search, some loose papers were given to the raiding party. They were a xerox copy of Karnataka Legislative Assembly, Legislator’s Diary pages of 2009 with details of numerical entries against some individual names. The original of these documents was never given.

The same was confronted to Sh. D. K. Shivakumar in a statement recorded under section 131 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 on 19/10/2017.

Ø  In response, he stated that this was a copy of diary, written by Mr. BS Yeddyurappa, and the payments paid on behalf of Mr. BS Yeddyurappa to legislators, and received from various leaders, MLAs, Ministers when they were in power.

Ø  On being asked as to how he got possession of the said loose sheets, in response, Sh DK Shivakumar stated that, being a politician, he procures information about other parties, leaders and members and as the said loose sheets contain political information, he cannot disclose the source of information. Further, he also stated that he keeps getting such information from the general public.

Ø  He also stated that he did not know the time period in which the said transactions have taken place and that he did not have the originals of the said loose sheets.

Ø   In response to the question as to why the said matter was not brought to the notice of ACB or Lokayukta of Karnataka, Sh D. K. Shivakumar stated that as he did not know about the genuineness of the said loose sheets, he did not inform the same to enforcement agencies.

Ø   He further stated that the handwriting in the loose sheets could be of Mr. B.S. Yeddyurappa on the basis of comparison between various documents written by Mr. BS Yeddyurappa and the handwriting in the loose sheets.

The said seized material and the statements of Sh DK Shivakumar were confronted to Sh B. S. Yedyurappa on 25.11.2017 in a statement recorded under section 131 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

Ø  He stated that he was not in the habit of writing a dairy and that the loose sheets in question were not in his handwriting. He denied his handwriting and signatures on the loose sheets.

Ø  Also, as the handwriting did not belong to him, he cannot have any knowledge about the contents of the said loose sheets.

Ø   He further stated that contents of the loose sheets were false and fabricated and his name has been used to malign his political career.

Ø   He also provided a sample of his handwriting in order to verify the genuineness of the said loose sheets. Further, he also stated that the fabricated loose sheets were politically motivated with an intention to tarnish his political image. 

In view of the said facts, an enquiry was made to The Director, Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Directorate of Forensics Science Services, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, Amberpet Post, Ramanthapur, Hyderabad - 500013, Telangana on availability of Document Analysis and the procedure, time period for the same on 18.04.2018.

In response, CFSL, Hyderabad replied on 24.04.2018 vide letter No.CFSL(H)/Documents/2018/410 dated 24.04.2018 that the examination of handwriting and signatures is carried out in the said laboratory and that all the disputed documents are to be sent in original. No originals were given by Shri D. K. Shivakumar.

It is clear that for a forensic analysis of the disputed writings to establish its evidentiary value, originals of the same are required. All efforts have been made by the Income Tax Office concerned to procure the originals of the disputed writings. However, the details about the place and custody of the original writings and, if the original writings exist, are not available. The same loose sheets prima-facie appear to be of a doubtful nature and were given by the person who was being raided for tax violations.

                GST Council in the 34th meeting held on 19th March, 2019 at New Delhi discussed the operational details for implementation of the recommendations made by the council in its 33rd meeting for lower effective GST rate of 1% in case of affordable houses and 5% on construction of houses other than affordable house. The council decided the modalities of the transition as follows.

 Option in respect of ongoing projects:

2.         The promoters shall be given a one -time option to continue to pay tax at the old rates (effective rate of 8% or 12% with ITC) on ongoing projects (buildings where construction and actual booking have both started before 01.04.2019) which have not been completed by 31.03.2019.

3.         The option shall be exercised once within a prescribed time frame and where the option is not exercised within the prescribed time limit, new rates shall apply.

New tax rates:

4.         The new tax rates which shall be applicable to new projects or ongoing projects which have exercised the above option to pay tax in the new regime are as follows.

(i) New rate of 1% without input tax credit (ITC) on construction of affordable houses shall be available for,

(a) all houses which meet the definition of affordable houses as decided by GSTC (area 60 sqm in metros / 90 sqm in non- metros and value upto RS. 45 lakhs), and

(b)  affordable houses being constructed in ongoing projects under the existing central and state housing schemes presently eligible for concessional rate of 8% GST (after 1/3rd land abatement).

(ii)        New rate of 5% without input tax creditshall be applicable on construction of,-


	all houses other than affordable houses in ongoing projects whether booked prior to or after 01.04.2019. In case of houses booked prior to 01.04.2019, new rate shall be available on instalments payable on or after 01.04.2019. 
	all houses other than affordable houses in new projects.
	commercial apartments such as shops, offices etc. in a residential real estate project (RREP) in which the carpet area of commercial apartments is  not more than 15% of total carpet area of all apartments.


Conditions for the new tax rates:

5.         The new tax rates of 1% (on construction of affordable) and 5% (on other than affordable houses) shall be available subject to following conditions,-


	Input tax credit shall not be available,
	80% of inputs and input services (other than capital goods, TDR/ JDA, FSI, long term lease (premiums)) shall be purchased from registered persons. On shortfall of purchases from 80%, tax shall be paid by the builder @ 18% on RCM basis. However, Tax on cement purchased from unregistered person shall be paid @ 28% under RCM, and on capital goods under RCM at applicable rates.


Transition for ongoing projects opting for the new tax rate:

6.1       Ongoing projects (buildings where construction and booking both had started before 01.04.2019) and have not been completed by 31.03.2019 opting for new tax rates shall transition the ITC as per the prescribed method.

6.2       The transition formula approved by the GST Council, for residential projects (refer to para 4(ii)) extrapolates ITC taken for percentage completion of construction as on 01.04.2019 to arrive at ITC for the entire project. Then based on percentage booking of flats and percentage invoicing, ITC eligibility is determined. Thus, transition would thus be on pro-rata basis based on a simple formula such that credit in proportion to booking of the flat and invoicing done for the booked flat is available subject to a few safeguards. 

6.3       For a mixed project transition shall also allow ITC on pro-rata basis in proportion to carpet area of the commercial portion in the ongoing projects (on which tax will be payable @ 12% with ITC even after 1.4.2019) to the total carpet area of the project. 

Treatment of TDR/ FSI and Long term lease for projects commencing after 01.04.2019 

7.         The following treatment shall apply to TDR/ FSI and Long term lease for projects commencing after 01.04.2019.

7.1       Supply of TDR, FSI, long term lease (premium) of land by a landowner to a developer shall be exempted subject to the condition that the constructed flats are sold before issuance of completion certificate and tax is paid on them. Exemption of TDR, FSI, long term lease (premium) shall be withdrawn in case of flats sold after issue of completion certificate, but such withdrawal shall be limited to 1% of value in case of affordable houses and 5% of value in case of other than affordable houses. This will achieve a fair degree of taxation parity between under construction and ready to move property.

7.2       The liability to pay tax on TDR, FSI, long term lease (premium) shall be shifted from land owner to builder underthe reverse charge mechanism (RCM).

7.3       The date on which builder shall be liable to pay tax on TDR, FSI, long term lease (premium) of land under RCM in respect of flats sold after completion certificate is being shifted to date of issue of completion certificate.

7.4       The liability of builder to pay tax on construction of houses given to land owner in a JDA is also being shifted to the date of completion. Decisions from para 7.1 to 7.4 are expected to address the problem of cash flow in the sector.

Amendment to ITC rules:

 

8.         ITC rules shall be amended to bring greater clarity on monthly and final determination of ITC and reversal thereof in real estate projects. The change would clearly provide procedure for availing input tax credit in relation to commercial units as such units would continue to be eligible for input tax credit in a mixed project.

9.         The decisions of the GST Council have been presented in this note in simple language for easy understanding.  The same would be given effect to through Gazette notifications/ circulars which alone shall have force of law.

                Sub-section (4) of Section 286 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 requires that a constituent entity of an international group, resident in India, other than a parent entity or an alternate reporting entity of an international group, resident in India, shall furnish the Country-by-Country (CbC) Report in respect of the said international Group for a reporting accounting year within the period as may be prescribed, if the parent entity of the said International Group is resident of a country or territory,—

Ø  where the parent entity is not obligated to file the CbC Report;

Ø  with which India does not have an agreement providing for exchange of the CbC Report; or

Ø  where there has been a systemic failure of the country or territory and the said failure has been intimated by the prescribed authority to such constituent entity.

 

Vide Notification in GSR 1217 (E) dated 18th December, 2018 with effect from 18th December, 2018, amendments to the Income-tax Rules. 1962 (the “Rules”) have been carried out to provide that the period for furnishing of the CbC report (local filing) shall be twelve months from the end of the reporting accounting year.

Further, vide Circular No.9/2018, dated 26th December, 2018, CBDT as a one-time measure, in exercise of powers conferred under section 119 of the Act, extended the period for furnishing of the CbC Report (local filing) in respect of reporting accounting years ending on or before 28th February, 2018 up to 31st March, 2019.

The absence of an Agreement between India and USA till now entailed a possibility of local filing of CbC Reports in India. However, a Bilateral Competent Authority Arrangement, along with an underlying Inter-Governmental Agreement, for exchange of CbC Reports between India and the USA has now been finalized and will be signed on or before 31st March, 2019. This would enable both the countries to exchange CbC Reports filed by the ultimate parent entities of International Groups in the respective jurisdictions, pertaining to the financial years commencing on or after 1st January, 2016. As a result, Indian constituent entities of international groups headquartered in USA, who have already filed CbC Reports in the USA, would not be required to do local filing of the CbC Reports of their international groups in India.

                The World Bank, the Government of India and representatives of 5 States of Government of India and Implementing Agencies signed here in New Delhi today the Loan Agreement for Additional Financing of $137 Million for the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) that will help rehabilitate and modernize over 220 selected large dams in the States of Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand. 

            In 2010, the Bank’s Board approved $350 million to finance the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project to improve the safety and sustainable performance of over 220 selected dams in India.  This Ongoing Project has so far benefitted 25 Million Primary Beneficiaries from urban and rural communities providing them water and livelihood opportunities. 

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance said that Fostering rapid and sustained agricultural growth is a key priority for the Government of India.  Due to erratic rainfall patterns, dams play a key role in storing water for irrigation and other uses. He further said that this Project will help improve safety and operational performance of large and small dams in India leading to sustained rural development. 

The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; and Mr. Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank, and the representatives from the State Governments of Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand. 

The additional funding of $137 million signed today will be used for construction of an additional spillway for Hirakud Dam in Odisha State as well as continue to help in rehabilitation and improvement of other dams including strengthening the institutional, legal and technical framework for dam safety assurance within the Government of India and in the participating States. 

            Mr. Junaid Ahmad, Country Director World Bank said that Infrastructure management often falls prey to a costly ‘build-decay-rebuild’ cycle.  He further said that breaking this pattern by ensuring that dams are well managed, properly maintained and efficiently operated is essential.  He concluded that this will ensure the welfare and safety of communities and sustain economic growth.  DRIP is delivering these important objectives. 

India is home to more than 5200 large dams and another 400 that are under construction having a total storage capacity of more than 300 billion cubic meters. Rainfall, which occurs mainly in intense and unpredictable downpours within short monsoon seasons, is of high temporal and spatial variability and does not meet year-round irrigation and other water demands. Considering this, storage of water is essential for India. The dams play a key role in fostering rapid and sustained agricultural and rural growth and development – a key priority for the Government of India since independence. 

These dams benefit millions of people who rely on their waters for livelihood, and therefore need to be strengthened with more investment in their operations and maintenance. Flood protection measures in many dams need to be supported as well, as their failure could pose serious risks to downstream communities. 

The World Bank has so far invested $280 million in the Project that acts as a “lighthouse”, showcasing how best to make dams fully operational and safe in a technically sound and sustainable manner. 

Mr. Chabungbam Rajagopal Singh and Mr. Arun Kumar Kolsur, Task Team Leaders for the Project said that in addition to the 25 Million Primary Beneficiaries from both urban and rural communities who are directly dependent on the project for their water supply and livelihood, the project will benefit downstream communities at risk due to flooding. 

The $137 Million Loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 3-year grace period, and a final maturity of 16 years.

                The Quarterly Report on Debt Management for the Quarter October-December 2018 (Q3 FY 2019) published.

 Since Apr-June (Q1) 2010-11, Public Debt Management Cell (PDMC) (earlier Middle Office), Budget Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has been bringing out a quarterly report on debt management on a regular basis. The Current Report pertains to the Quarter October-December 2018 (Q3 FY 2019). 

            During Q3 of FY19, the Central Government issued dated securities worth ` 1,27,000 crore as against ₹1,64,000 crore in Q3 of FY18. The weighted average maturity (WAM) of new issuances stood at 14.70 years in Q3 of FY 19 (14.09 years in Q3 of FY 18). The weighted average yield (WAY) of issuances for the same quarter was 7.82 per cent compared to 7.03 per cent in Q3 of FY 18. The temporary cash flow mismatches were bridged through issuance of Cash Management Bills amounting to ₹45,000 crore during the quarter. The net average liquidity injection by RBI under Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) including MSF was ₹80,077.24 crore during the quarter. 

            The total liabilities (including liabilities under the ‘Public Account’) of the Government, as per provisional data, increased to ₹83,40,027 crore at end-December 2018 from ₹82,03,197 crore at end-September 2018. Public debt accounted for 89.5 per cent of total outstanding liabilities at end-December 2018 with the share of internal debt being 83.3 per cent. Nearly 29.27 per cent of the outstanding dated securities had a residual maturity of less than 5 years. The holding pattern indicates a share of 40.5 per cent for commercial banks and 24.6 per cent for insurance companies by end-December 2018. 

            G-Sec yields have softened in Q3 of FY19 with the decrease in weighted average yield of primary issuances to 7.82 per cent from 8.01 per cent since the last quarter reflecting the impact of several developments namely strengthening in the value of Rupee against the US dollar and RBI injecting durable liquidity in the system through OMO (purchase). The yield on 10-year benchmark G-Sec (7.17% GS 2028) closed lower at 7.37 per cent on December 31, 2018. There was a parallel downward shift in the G-Sec yield curve, indicating softening of the yields across the curve. Central Government dated securities continued to account for a major share of total trading volumes in the secondary market, with a share of 84 per cent in total outright trading volumes in value terms during Q3 of FY19.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for creation of the Post of Technical Member in Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), Mumbai at the level of Secretary to the Government of India in the pay scale of Rs. 2,25,000/- (fixed) or Level 17 of the Pay Matrix as per the 7th Pay Commission. 

 

Benefits:

          Creation of the post will facilitate the creation of an additional bench in SAT, Mumbai thereby allowing speedy disposal of the increased number of appeals in SAT with respect to Securities and Exchanges Board of India, (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), which will be much beneficial to investors, pensioners and the general public. The securities market and insurance sector are growing rapidly. With increase in the volume of trading in securities market, and clients in the insurance sector, it is likely that the grievances will also increase. Therefore, it is necessary that a speedy redressal system is established. It would ensure speedy disposal of appeal cases related to insurance, securities market and pension benefitting the general public.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister has approved delegation of the following to Alternative Mechanism in all the cases of Strategic Disinvestment of CPSEs where CCEA has given 'in principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment:

(i)        The quantum of shares to be transacted, mode of sale and final pricing of the transaction or lay down the principles/ guidelines for such pricing; and the selection of strategic partner/ buyer; terms and conditions of sale; and

(ii)      To decide on the proposals of CGD with regard the timing, price, the terms & conditions of sale, and any other related issue to the transaction.

This will facilitate quick decision-making and obviate the need for multiple instances of approval by CCEA for the same CPSE.

                The World Bank and the Government of India signed here today in New Delhi a $250 Million Agreement for the National Rural Economic Transformation Project (NRETP) which will help women in rural households shift to a new generation of economic initiatives by developing viable enterprise for farm and non-farm products.   

A Key Focus of the Project will be to promote women-owned and women-led farm and non-farm enterprises across value chains; enable them to build businesses that help them access finance, markets and networks; and generate employment. 

The National Rural Economic Transformation Project (NRETP) is an additional financing to the $500 million National Rural Livelihoods Project (NRLP) approved by the World Bank in July 2011.  The NRLP which is currently being implemented across 13 states, 162 districts and 575 blocks, has so far mobilized more than 8.8 million women from poor rural households into 750,000 self-help groups (SHGs). These SHGs have been further federated into 48,700 Village Organizations and 2900 Cluster/Gram Panchayat-level Federations.  While these 13 states will continue to be supported under the new project signed today, 125 new districts will be added from within these states.  

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance said that the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) aims to alleviate rural poverty and create sustainable livelihood opportunities in rural communities by promoting sustainable community-based institutions which will facilitate economic and financial services for the rural poor. He further said that this additional funding will help give impetus to the poverty alleviation measures by the Government and ensure equitable and inclusive growth in the country. 

The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; and Mr. Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank. 

 

Mr. Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank, India said that the National Rural Livelihoods Project has mobilized close to 9 million rural women into strong self-managed institutional platforms, helping them access services, participate in Gram Sabhas and start engaging in income generating activities. Many of these women are now geared towards moving into higher order economic initiatives in farm and non-farm sectors. He further said that the New Project will now help them engage purposefully in an evolving rural economy. 

Since its launch in 2011, the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) has mobilized 50 million poor rural women into self-help groups and their higher-level federations. These groups have leveraged nearly $30 billion from commercial banks.  

The NERTP will support enterprise development programs for rural poor women and youth by creating a platform to access finance including start-up financing options to build their individual and/or collectively owned and managed enterprises. The other key component of the project includes developing financial products using digital financial services to help small producer collectives scale-up and engage with the market.  It will also support youth skills development, in coordination with the Deen Dayal Upadyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana.  Peer to peer learning across States and across communities was a successful strategy under the NRLP and will also continue to be used in this project. 

The Project will continue to give technical assistance, skills building and investment support to strengthen women-owned and women-led producer collectives diversify into high value farm and non-farm commodities such as commercial crops and livestock products, and fisheries. 

            “This project aspires to transform the economic participation of SHGs and rural women entrepreneurs by helping them engage on a strong footing with formal private financing, expand women owned and women managed enterprises and increase women’s labour force participation in viable agriculture and non-farm economic activities,” said Ms. Gayatri Acharya, Lead Rural Development Economist and World Bank’s Task Team Leader for the project. ""The project draws on lessons learned from the rich experiences of livelihood projects from across the country which have generated 2.5 million emerging entrepreneurs,” added Mr. Vinay Vutukuru, co-Task Team Leader and Senior Agricultural Specialist. 

The $250 Million Loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 5-year grace period, and a final maturity of 20 years.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley said that the Government is committed to facilitate trade and industry in the country so that the momentum of the growth continues to move-up. He asked the captains of Indian industry to comply with the recent recommendations of the GST Council with regard to reduction of rates of various items and pass on the benefits to the consumers at large. The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley was speaking when a delegation of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI)  called on him in his office in New Delhi today.

 

The Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley said that the process of reforms in case of direct and indirect taxes will continue in order to facilitate and further expedite the process of ease of doing business in the country. He said that Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has brought a change in the credit culture in the country and is helping the Banking Sector in making fast recoveries. The Finance Minister said that GST is now on the track and is in process of fast settling down. The Finance Minster said that the thrust of the Government is to lower the tax rate and widen the tax base and keep the revenue collections moving-up. He said that the indirect tax collections will further increase in future.

Earlier, Mr. Sandip Somany, President, FICCI presented a copy of the FICCI publication- ‘Ägenda for Growth and Shared Prosperity’- to the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley. 

 

Mr. Somany thanked the Union Finance Minister for the Government’s decision to introduce the Direct Income Support scheme for Small and Marginal Farmers during the Interim Budget 2019-20.

 

      FICCI President also congratulated the Finance Minister for the decisive action taken on many economic fronts including Landmark Reforms like Introduction of GST and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act among others.

 

      To continue with the process of Direct Tax reforms. President, FICCI requested the Finance Minister to consider lowering of the Corporate Tax Rate to 25% for all companies irrespective of their turnover. A rationalisation of the Corporate Tax Rate would make the Indian Corporate Sector globally competitive.

 

     The point on further consolidation of the Banking Sector and the need for divestment of Government Shareholding in some of the banks was also discussed. Another related point was the need to have Development Finance Institutions in the country to be able to provide long term finance for growth of the industrial and infrastructure sectors.

 

      The importance of the NBFC sector was highlighted and members drew attention to growth in the consumer durables and real estate sector, much of which was supported by the NBFC sector. In this context it was mentioned that while the liquidity situation in the market had improved, some more steps were needed to restore the situation to complete normalcy.

 

     Discussions were also held on the need to take all possible steps to improve employment generation in the economy. President, FICCI urged the Finance Minister to reintroduce investment allowance linking it with employment generation. A request was also made to extend the Phased Manufacturing Program to other sectors where the country is largely dependent on imports.

 

 The Meeting ended with a vote of thanks to the Chair.

                The Government of India, the State Government of Chhattisgarh and the World Bank signed here in New Delhi today a $25.2 Million Loan Agreement to support the State’s Reforms in Expenditure Management. This support will cover Expenditure Planning, Investment Management, Budget Execution, Public Procurement and Accountability.

The Chhattisgarh Public Financial Management and Accountability Program, which is the First Bank-Financed State-Level Project in Chhattisgarh in nearly a decade, will also help the State strengthen its Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and Tax Administration Systems.

The New Project will build capacity of the State’s Human Resources and the Institutions Handling Management of Public Finances. The World Bank will facilitate cross-learning from Public Financial Management (PFM) Reforms undertaken by it in other Indian States while bringing in global experiences.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance said that the Government of India supports reforms that will contribute toward improving Public Expenditure Management. The Chhattisgarh PFM reflects the priorities identified by the State, and builds, incrementally, on ongoing reforms around Public Financial Management, he added.


The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; Ms Kamal Preet Dhillon, Secretary, Finance, on behalf of the Government of Chhattisgarh; and Mr. Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank.

After the Loan Signing Ceremony, Mr. Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank said that the Chhattisgarh Government has correctly identified improvements in Public Financial Management as a key step for achieving its development potential. This will ensure that the State can invest more and with greater efficiency, for its poor and vulnerable. He said that the New Project, with its focus on IT solutions, will benefit almost 11,000 Village Panchayats and 168 Urban Municipalities in the State.

With 92 % households in the State belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, the Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs) are increasingly being used by the Central and State Governments to channel resources to households and individuals. The Program will support development of systems that will facilitate inter-departmental data interaction under secured protocols and automate most of the processing and payment of DBTs in the State.

Almost 11,000 Village Panchayats and 168 Urban Municipalities in Chhattisgarh are likely to benefit from the program’s emphasis on transparency and accountability. It will also support the State Government’s initiative to put in place systems to automate most of the processing and payment of DBTs to beneficiaries; improve property tax collection through the digitization of property tax rolls; and extending the property surveys to 47 municipalities. Enhanced outreach and improved tax return filing performance are also likely to help the State’s objective of increasing the number of GST Taxpayer Registrations.

Mr. Manvinder Mamak and Mr. Papia Bhattacharjee, Senior World Bank Financial Management Specialists, and Mr. John Blomquist, Lead Economist and the Task Team Leaders for the Program said that with enhanced devolution of taxes, 60 percent of the Public Expenditure now takes place at the State Level. This, coupled with greater flexibility in Planning Development Programs to suit local needs, deepening Public Financial Management Capacity at the State Level is imperative. They said that the World Bank’s international experience and learning from other States of India will help Chhattisgarh gain from appropriate solutions.

  
The $25.2 Million Loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 5-year grace period, and a final maturity of 10.5 years.

                The World Bank, Government of India and Government of Uttarakhand (GoUK) signed here today a $96 Million Loan Agreement to provide additional funds to the State of Uttarakhand in its post-disaster recovery plans, ongoing since the floods of 2013, as well as strengthen its capacity for Disaster Risk Management. 

 The World Bank, through the Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Project, has been supporting the State Government since 2014 to restore housing and rural connectivity, and to build resilience of communities. So far, the Project has completed more than 2,000 permanent houses and 23 public buildings and restored over 1,300 kilometers of roads and 16 bridges. The additional financing of $96 million will further help in the reconstruction of bridges, road and river bank protection works, and in the construction of a training facility for the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF).  The Project will also help to increase the technical capacity of the State Entities to respond promptly and more effectively to such crises in the future. 

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Govt. of India said that India is vulnerable, in varying degrees, to many natural as well as man-made disasters.  The Government of India is committed to develop a holistic, proactive, multi-disaster-oriented strategy, using technology effectively to build a safe and disaster resilient India. He further said that the Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Project has been delivering on these objectives and the additional finance will help expand its impact. 

The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; Mr. Amit Negi, Secretary, Finance and Disaster Management, Government of Uttarakhand and Program Director, Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Project on behalf of the Govt. of Uttarakhand; and Mr. Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank 

In June 2013, a heavy deluge caused devastating floods and landslides in the Himalayan State of Uttarakhand. The disaster, the worst of its kind since the 2003 tsunami, hit more than 4,200 villages, damaged 2,500 houses, and killed 4,000 people. 

After the signing ceremony, Mr. Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank said that Natural disasters cost the country an average of $9.8 billion annually. The Government of India has made great strides in moving from reactive emergency response to proactively implement disaster preparedness and risk reduction initiatives. He said that we are committed to supporting Uttarakhand in its efforts towards a resilient recovery and rehabilitation. The Project has helped in strengthening the State’s Disaster Risk Management Capacity which has led to enhanced investment in long-term resilience through policies and institutions. The capacity of the SDRF, meant to be at the forefront during emergency situations of the State, has also been significantly strengthened and it has so far conducted over 250 operations rescuing over 3,500 people, during the high pilgrimage season. 

The extent and pace of recovery since 2013 has been significant, however, connectivity remains a challenge. Landslides and river bank erosion are common and continue to disrupt movement and cause accidents, affecting the livelihood and access to services of the local community. In the aftermath of the floods, the number of tourists visiting the State dropped from over 2.5 million in 2012 to less than 350,000 in 2014. 

After signing of Agreement, Mr. Ignacio Urrutia, Task Team Leader for the Project said that while the impacts of climate change in future disasters remain uncertain, efforts to ensure that the State has additional capabilities and resilient infrastructure to reduce the potential damages and recover more quickly from disasters will translate into important beneficial ripple effects on the State’s economy and livelihoods in the long term. 

The $96 Million Loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 5-year grace period, and a final maturity of 15 years.

                The Government of India has decided to allow one more opportunity to employees of Public Sector Insurance Companies (PSICs) who joined on or before 28th June 1995, to opt for Pension, as a retirement benefit.

Pension was introduced as a retirement benefit in PSICs with effect from 28th June 1995.  In April 1997, employees of LIC and Public Sector General Insurance Companies namely, GIC, NICL, OICL, UIICL and NIACL, who joined service on or before 28th June 1995 were given another opportunity to opt for Pension, as a retirement benefit.

However, many eligible employees could not exercise the option and there has been a long standing demand from them to be given another option.  

In order to mitigate the hardship of such employees of whom many have retired, Government has decided as a welfare measure, to allow one more opportunity to employees of PSICs who joined service on or before 28th June 1995, to opt for the Pension scheme of their respective organizations, in lieu of Contributory Provident Fund.

This decision is expected to benefit 42,720 employees (serving and retired) of which 24,595 are of LIC and 18,125 of PSGICs.

                The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of India signed a $926 Million Loan Agreement today to operationalize two lines for the Mumbai Metro Rail System that will ease the distress of millions of commuters each day and help provide a cleaner, less congested city. 

The Single Largest Infrastructure Project Loan in ADB history approved by the ADB Board on 26 February, 2019 - will help fund lines 2A (Dahisar to D.N. Nagar), 2B (D.N. Nagar–Bandra–Mandale), and 7 (Dahisar [East] to Andheri [East]), totaling about 58 kilometers (km). The project will fund 63 six-car trains, signaling and safety systems, and help establish a new dedicated metro operations organization to manage the entire metro network in Mumbai. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) will implement the project. 

Once operational by the end of 2022, an estimated 2 million passengers a day will use the two new lines, travelling in improved safety and comfort. It will also reduce emissions from vehicles, with carbon dioxide emissions expected to fall by about 166,000 tons a year. 

“ADB financing will ease travel for millions of commuters across Mumbai, help decongest heavily crowded suburban rail systems, and contribute to providing modern, clean, and livable urban environment to its citizens,” said Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission who signed the loan agreement for ADB. 

“The New Mumbai Metro is an ambitious and truly transformative venture planned by the state government which will contribute to enhance the efficiency of the urban transport network and productivity of India’s financial center,” said Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary (Fund Bank and ADB), Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance who signed the loan on behalf of Government of India. 

Mumbai, with a population of about 12 million, is the capital of the state of Maharashtra and renowned as the financial capital of India. Maharashtra accounts for about 15% of India’s gross domestic product, about 40% of which is generated from the Mumbai metropolitan region. Rail is the primary means of transport in Mumbai, where the suburban network totals almost 400 km and carries more than 7.5 million passengers a day. 

Recognizing the transportation challenges, the government has developed a plan for 12 metro lines with a total length of 276 km. Line 1, completed in 2014 on a public-private partnership model, carries about 400,000 passengers a day and has reduced travel time along its east-west route from 71 minutes to 21 minutes. Other new metro lines will ease travel and make the city more livable and competitive. Since access to the stations is sometimes difficult, ADB is also assisting MMRDA to improve last mile connectivity by piloting electric vehicles and non-motorized transport at select stations. 

Carriages procured under this project will feature high-level safety features and automation, including surveillance systems, door closing, and train obstacle detectors. Platforms will have automatic doors, which will be synchronized with the trains, so there will no longer be a danger of surging crowds pushing passengers onto the tracks. The tracks will be elevated about 9 meters above road level, ensuring no nearby residents are put at risk. 

Various features that will benefit women include women-only carriages, mobile applications for women’s security, separate ticket counters, and reporting desks to address incidents of harassment. It will ensure women have improved opportunities for employment along the new lines, including a station staffed only by women. There will be station and carriage facilities for elderly or differently-abled passengers including priority e-ticket counters.

                The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare commemorated the World TB Day with a function to mark the occasion, and reiterated the commitment to eliminating TB in the country by 2025. Ms. Preeti Sudan, Health Secretary presided over the function. She stressed on the importance of more sensitive and responsive doctors, paramedics, frontline health workers and community partners, while dealing with TB patients. The systems of care for TB patients should be patient –centric, and sympathetic to their wellbeing, she emphasised. She stated that India has been able to free of Polio, Yaws, MNTE due to the sturdy health systems, especially at the primary healthcare levels. She stated that partnerships with all stakeholders hold the key to making India TB-free.

She led the participants of the event to take a  pledge to unite together to contribute and support towards making India TB free. 

Various presentations made at the event highlighted the key changes introduced in the policy landscape of TB in the country. India is now closest ever to covering all TB cases with 21.5 lakh new TB patients notified in 2018. With the aim of universal access to free diagnostics and treatment services, path breaking policy changes have been introduced. Universal drug susceptibility testing has been rolled out, shorter and newer treatment regimen has been expanded countrywide. India is moving towards an injection free regimen. Private sector engagement has been elevated as one of the highest priorities with strengthened regulatory measures, collaborative incentives and scale up of successful Patient Provider Support Agency (PPSA) interventions which led to a 35% increase in TB notification from the private sector. The Nikshay Poshan Yojana has benefited 15 lakh TB patients for nutrition support with Rs. 240 cores disbursed as DBT since April 2018. A comprehensive call centre (1800-11-6666) for information, addressing grievance, patient linkages and provider relationship has been established. Institutional system of award for TB free status has been introduced to generate federal competitiveness, motivate and to bring about proactive actions from States and Districts. As on date, 15 lakh patients have been initiated in the Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) regime. TB forums at various levels in the states have been formed to remove stigma and to create awareness about the symptoms of the disease and the free treatment available at the government health facilities. 1180 CBNAAT labs have been made operational throughout the country, along with 4 lakh treatment support centres at the village level. These efforts have resulted in increase from 25% to 83% in the treatment success rates (2017-2018), and the TB prevalence rates have come down from 29% to 4%.  

TB champions from states shared their stories of overcoming the stigma of being a TB patient and motivating other patients to undergo the treatment. A special issue on TB of the Indian Journal of Tuberculosis and a toolkit on Patient Provider Support Agency were also unveiled at the function.

Also present at the event were Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Additional Secretary & Director General (RNTCP & NACP), and senior officers of the Ministry, representatives from WHO and other development partners, community support organisations.

                The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare with the officials from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reviewed the current situation, state preparedness and action taken to deal with West Nile Fever (WNF) in Mallapuram district, Kerala,  today. MOHFW deputed a multi-disciplinary public health team to Mallapuram District to investigate various epidemiological aspects of West Nile Virus in the district and State.

The State has been advised to follow the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) guidelines of personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. This guideline is available at NVBDCP website (nvbdcp.gov.in or nvbdcp.gov.in/WriteReadData/l892s/JE-AES-Prevention-Control(NPPCJA).pdf). The Ministry has also recommended vector surveillance and control to be carried out in coordination with NVBDCP. All cases of JE/AES are to be investigated as per guidelines of JE/ AES and also tested for West Nile Virus. Further, the community is to be sensitized through IEC campaigns on use of personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites as per NVBDCP Guidelines. 

West Nile Fever is a mosquito borne zoonotic disease caused by a flavivirus -West Nile Virus (WNV). This virus is related to viruses that cause Japanese Encephalitis, yellow fever and St. Louis encephalitis. Human infection is most often due to bites from infected mosquitoes. To date, no human-to-human transmission of WNV through casual contact has been documented. Infection with WNV is either asymptomatic (no symptoms) in around 80% of infected people, or can lead to West Nile fever or severe West Nile disease.

Testing for West Nile Virus is available at the National Institute of Virology, Pune and National Institute of Virology, Allapuzha. Facility for xeno-diagnosis with respect to infection among vectors is available at VCRC, Kottayam. NCDC branch in Kozhikode, in coordination with VCRC, Kottayam, will provide assistance for vector surveillance and xeno-diagnosis in the vector as well as prepare and disseminate a standardised hospital management protocol of AES case management to be followed by all hospitals catering to cases of AES.

                The Hon. President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, launched the Pulse Polio programme for 2019 by administering polio drops to children less than five years old, at the Rahstrapati Bhawan, in the presence of Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare. The Hon. President administered the polio drops on the eve of the National Immunization Day, which is observed tomorrow. More than 17 crore children of less than five years across the country will be given polio drops as part of the drive of Government of India to sustain polio eradication from the country.

Speaking at the function, the Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare Shri J P Nadda said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Universal Immunization Programme is focusing to protect children from more diseases than ever before and has introduced several new vaccines like Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, Rotavirus vaccine, and Measles-Rubella vaccine in the recent past. “To provide additional protection to our children, Government has also introduced the injectable Inactivated Polio Vaccine into its routine immunization program,” Shri Nadda added.  

Shri J P Nadda pointed out that Government is making all efforts to protect children from more and more diseases and emphasized that all vaccines under the programme must reach every last child of the country. “Along with Universal Immunization Programme of the country, we have also launched Mission Indradhanush to accelerate our goal to achieve more than 90% full immunization coverage. More than 3.39 crore children and 87 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated through Mission Indradhanush drives,” Shri Nadda elaborated.

Shri Nadda further informed that strengthening of immunization programme has contributed significantly to the decline of Infant Mortality Rate from 39 in 2014 to 32 per 1000 live births in 2017.

The Health Minister also appreciated the efforts of State Governments and the supporting organizations like WHO, UNICEF and Rotary International etc., for strengthening the efforts of the Government not only for polio programme but also for other initiatives in immunization. He also applauded the efforts of the thousands of volunteers, frontline workers, and health officials across the states for their tireless efforts in keeping the country polio-free.

Also present at the function were Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), senior officers of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and representatives of development partners.

                Central Government in its pursuit of strong action against terrorism, has today declared JKLF (Yasin faction) as an unlawful association under the provisions of Section 3(1) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. 

2.     Central Government has followed the policy of ‘Zero Tolerance’ against terrorism and has acted strongly against terrorists.  Securities Forces have been given free hand to deal with terrorism.

3.     Government is committed to relentlessly pursuing the policy of curbing the activities of secessionist organizations which are threat to unity and integrity of the country.  NIA and Enforcement Directorate are taking strong action against these organizations.

4.     With above objective, Government on 28.02.2019 has declared ‘Jamaat-e-Islami (J&K)’ as an unlawful association under the provisions of Section 3(1) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. 

5.     It was made clear at that time that ‘Jamaat-e-Islami (J&K)’ is separate from ‘Jamaat-e-Islami Hind’.  In 1953, it made its own constitution.  JeI (J&K) is responsible for formation of Hizbul Mujahidin (HM), the biggest terrorist organization active in Jammu & Kashmir. JeI (J&K) has been providing all kind of support to HM in terms of recruits, funding, shelter, logistics, etc

6.     Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front led by Md. Yasin Malik has spearheaded the separatist ideology in the valley and has been at the fore-front of separatist activities and violence since 1988. Murders of Kashmiri Pandits by JKLF in 1989 triggered their exodus from the valley. Md. Yasin Malik was the mastermind behind the purging of Kashmiri Pandits from the Kashmir valley and is responsible for their genocide.

7.     JKLF has many serious cases registered against it. This organisation is responsible for murder of 4 Indian Air Force personnel and kidnapping of Dr. Rubaiya Sayeed (daughter of the then Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in Shri V. P. Singh’s Government). This organization, alongside, is also responsible for illegal funneling of funds for fomenting terrorism.  JKLF is actively involved in raising of funds and its distribution to Hurriyat cadres and stone-pelters to fuel unrest in the Kashmir valley as well as for subversive activities.

8.     Activities of JKLF (Y) pose a serious threat to the security of the country and are prejudicial to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of India. The organization has been actively and continuously encouraging, feelings of enmity and hatred against the lawfully established Government as well as armed rebellion.

9.     37 FIRs have been registered by J&K Police against JKLF. Two cases including the case of murder of IAF personnel were registered by CBI.  NIA has also registered a case, which is under investigation. It is evident from these that JKLF continues to be actively engaged in supporting and inciting secessionism and terrorism including terror financing.

                The two-day International Workshop on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (IWDRI) successfully concluded here today. Experts from 33 countries representing a wide variety of development and disaster risk contexts, multilateral development banks, the United Nations, the private sector, academia, policy think tanks and other stakeholders participated in the workshop.

In his special address, the Chairman of the 15th Finance Commission of India, Shri N. K. Singh called for collective action on resilient infrastructure so that people-centric solutions are found. 

“As millions of people will continue to move to towns and cities in the near future, urban resilience will be the key for sustainability”, said Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog, while delivering the inaugural address. He added “it is the States where all the action happens and urged working in collaboration with State Governments for better results. 

Reiterating the importance of disaster resilient infrastructure in achieving sustainable development goals, the Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Dr. P. K. Mishra proposed three mantras for achieving sustainability in DRI - the need to focus on the poor and the vulnerable; to follow an inclusive approach of collaboration with multiple stakeholders; and ensure proactive connectedness with other Global Processes in DRR.

The Workshop identified good practices of disaster risk management in key infrastructure sectors such as Transport, Energy, Telecom and Water. It also discussed emerging technologies and nature-based innovation in the context of climate change and its impact on creation, operation and maintenance of infrastructure. The need and practical issues concerning finance and insurance for infrastructure were also discussed during the workshop.It set the stage for taking the dialogue on the proposed Coalition for DRI (CDRI) forward at the global level.

The CDRI is envisaged as a knowledge exchange and capacity development partnership. India had announced the creation of a CDRI soon after the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, which was held in New Delhi in 2016.

The Second IWDRI was organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) jointly with United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), and in partnership with the Global Commission on Adaptation, United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank.

Various international agreements have also reiterated the importance and long-term benefits of investing in resilient infrastructure. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), 2015-2030, which is the first major agreement of the post-2015 development agenda, identifies investing in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) for resilience and to build back better in reconstruction as priorities for action towards reducing disaster risk. Similarly, Goal 9 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognizes disaster resilient infrastructure as a crucial driver of economic growth and development.

                The 3rd Indo-Japan Workshop on Disaster Risk Reduction was held here today. The workshop was attended by about 140 delegates from Japan and India including experts from both the governments, top premium research institutes, city administrators, specialized Disaster Management agencies and private sector.

The Government of India and the Government of Japan had signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) in the field of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in September 2017. The 3rd Indo-Japan workshop is the follow-up of the deliberations held during the 1st Indo-Japan Workshop on DRR held on March 18-19, 2018 in New Delhi as well as during the 2nd Indo-Japan workshop on DRR held on October 13-15, 2018 in Tokyo, Japan. The 3rd workshop was organized with an objective of enhancing collaboration between research institutes, cities and the private sector in the field of Disaster Risk Reduction. 

Inaugurating the workshop, Dr. P. K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, said that both India and Japan have world class research institutions and collaboration among them can lead to capacity building at all levels. He added that the collaboration between cities, research institutions and private sector will also result in mutual benefit and long-term Disaster Risk Reduction. Our world is changing very fast and evolving targets of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) need to be supported by solid research.  He emphasised that the collaboration between India and Japan should be strengthened in the areas of Early Warning Systems, build-back-better, capacity development, Science & Technology application and institution strengthening. 

The Japanese delegation included Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination, Cabinet Office, Mr. Akihiro Nakamura, Ambassador of Japan to India, Mr. Kenji Hiramatsu, along with Government officials, domain experts from leading research institutes and various private companies working in the fields of Disaster Risk Reduction had participated in this workshop. 

Japanese Ambassador, in his address, appreciated that the workshop has been held once every six months and reiterated the significance of three themes set for this workshop as collaboration amongst research institutes, among cities and among private companies, from the point of view that Disaster Risk Reduction should involve various stakeholders, and expressed Japan’s continuous support to India’s challenges towards DRR in every possible way.  

 Ms Mami Mizutori, Assistant Secretary General and Special Representative of the Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction, United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), in her address, said that disasters are complex problems, and no country or organization has all the answers on how to best mitigate every type of disaster. India and Japan are two countries that have faced some of the biggest disasters in human history, but have also taken concrete steps towards better Disaster Management in the future. There is a lot to share between the two countries and she strongly believed that their joint efforts will advance global resilience. 

On the sidelines of the event, Dr. P. K. Mishra held bilateral talks with Mr. Akihiro Nakamura, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination, Cabinet Office, Japan.  During bilateral talks, the two countries reaffirmed their commitment for bilateral cooperation in the areas of Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.

                An International Workshop on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (IWDRI) will be inaugurated here tomorrow. The two-day workshop is being organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), and in partnership with the Global Commission on Adaptation, United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank.

The workshop aims to i) identify good practices of disaster risk management in key infrastructure sectors, ii) identify specific areas and pathways for collaborative research on DRI (Transport, Energy, Telecom and Water), iii) discuss and co-create the broad contours of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) as well as a notional roll-out plan for the next three years, and iv) build a forum for members to work on areas of common interest and make specific commitments.

It will bring together countries from different parts of the world, multilateral development banks, UN agencies, academia and research institutions, the private sector, academics and policy think tanks to discuss and collaborate on promoting policies and practices towards achieving disaster resilience of large infrastructure systems (transport, telecom, energy, water). This will also be a great opportunity to learn from the unique experiences of different countries.

Various international agreements have also reiterated the importance and long-term benefits of investing in resilient infrastructure. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), 2015-2030, which is the first major agreement of the post-2015 development agenda, identifies investing in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) for resilience and to build back better in reconstruction as priorities for action towards reducing disaster risk. Similarly, Goal 9 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognizes disaster resilient infrastructure as a crucial driver of economic growth and development.

Besides reducing infrastructure losses, disaster resilient infrastructure will also help achieve targets pertaining to reduction in mortality, number of affected people and economic losses due to disasters.

The first International Workshop on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (IWDRI 2018) was held in January 2018. This workshop will further build upon some of the ideas generated at the IWDRI 2018 as a crucial milestone towards the establishment of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). The CDRI is envisaged as a knowledge exchange and capacity development partnership. India announced the creation of a CDRI soon after the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, which was held in New Delhi in 2016.

As a special dispensation, war-widows will be exempt from one-time contribution to join ECHS.  

 

Launched by NDA Government in April 2003, ECHS provides quality medicare to 54 lakh ex-servicemen pensioners, their dependents and a few other categories. 

 

Measures for welfare of Ex-Servicemen:

 

Today's decision is yet another landmark step in the pro-active policies of the Government since its very first days for welfare of our valiant ex-servicemen, who rendered valuable service to the country.   

 

Implementation of 'One Rank One Pension' for ex-servicemen, a demand which had been pending for over four decades, has resulted in over 20 lakh ex-servicemen receiving more thanRs. 35,000 Crore under the scheme.  Other welfare measures by the Government for  ex-servicemen include increase in pension by 40%, disability pension for pre-mature retirees, applicability of battle causality compensation at Line of Actual Control, Line of Control and International Border, financial assistance to soldiers on their supreme sacrifice through newly created Army Battle Causalities Welfare Fund, enhancement of ex-gratia ad-hoc allowance, Special Pension to Ex-sailors and skill development training in 36 job roles to over 30,000 retiring soldiers so far.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said the Government is committed to improve the working conditions and quality of life of jawans of the Central Armed Police forces (CAPFs). He was speaking at an event here after inaugurating 28 projects covering 5,283 housing units, 71 non-residential buildings and 34 barracks built at a cost of Rs 1,895 Crores of various CAPFs, Delhi Police and Central Police Organisations (CPOs). He also laid the foundation stone of three projects of LPAI.

Appreciating the valour, hardwork and contribution of the jawans in providing security to the country and its people, the Home Minister said the Government has implemented several measures to improve various facilities and amenities to the CAPFs during the last nearly five years, yet more needs to be done. “Despite our best efforts made for the welfare of jawans, there is still room to do more,” said Shri Rajnath Singh. He interacted with officers and jawans of various CAPFs during the inauguration from across the country through video link. They were highly appreciative of Home Minister and MHA’s assistance and expressed gratitude to him. Shri Singh, in turn, told them that the country reposes faith in them and the CAPFs won this trust through their selfless duty, devotion to work and sacrifices. 

The Home Minister listed several recent decisions made by the Government to boost the morale of the CAPF jawans. They include:

Free air travel from Jammu to Srinagar and back on duty/ leave and also on duty from Delhi to Srinagar and back. 

Enhancement of existing Risk and Hardship Allowances for CAPF personnel deployed in Jammu and Kashmir, LWE affected districts. 

The CAPF personnel wounded during an operation and admitted to a hospital would be considered on duty during the period of their treatment. The Operational Casualty Certificate was introduced on October 9, 2017. Besides, the ex-gratia payable to a CAPF martyr has been enhanced from Rs.15 lakh to Rs.35 lakh. Shri Rajnath Singh said though no amount of monetary compensation is enough for the sacrifices made by the jawans in the line of duty, he has ensured that every CAPF martyr’s family gets a minimum of Rs. 1 crore. For this, the Bharat ke Veer Fund has been created which has already raised huge sums in donations. Besides, private institutions are also providing scholarships to wards of CAPF martyrs. CAPF martyrs’ dependents are now entitled to preferential allotment of LPG outlets at par with martyrs of the Armed Forces. “A proposal to provide assistance during the period of recovery from injuries in addition to the treatment costs is under active consideration,” he added. The Union Home Minister assured there will be no shortage of money for benefit of CAPF/CPOs personnel as India has enough resources both from Government, Public and Private Sector. “You constitute the first and vital aspect of the development process, - the security,” said Shri Rajnath Singh, adding, “the provision of better facilities will improve performance and satisfaction level among the jawans.”

The Home Minister said the Government has allocated Rs.425 crore for Police Modernization during the FY 2018-19. Ministry of Home Affairs has approved the raising of two Mahila Battalions in CRPF and 21 Mahila Companies in SSB. Ten India Reserve Battalions have been sanctioned for the North-Eastern Region where the insurgency related incidents have shrunk by a huge 85%. Government has also set up more Central Forensic Sciences Laboratories (CFSL) to aid in crime investigation while a new NSG hub has been set up in Gujarat. With capacity building and better coordination among CAPFs, State Police Forces and Security Agencies, the security scenario has improved significantly in LWE affected areas while concerted operations are being carried out in J&K to check cross-border terrorism.

Addressing the gathering, the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir said the Government is concerned about providing better facilities and amenities to the CAPF jawans.

Speaking on the occasion, MoS (Home) Shri Kiren Rijiju said that the Government has ensured timely utilization of MHA budget as compared to the period prior to 2014. 

Special Secretary (Internal Security) Shri AP Maheshwari, in his address, said the Government has taken several steps to improve the working conditions and housing satisfaction levels in the CAPFs. The Government has also initiated steps to enhance Women’s Security, Separate Family Accommodation, schools and other infrastructure facilities at CAPF formations.

Delivering the Vote of Thanks, Director General, CRPF, Shri Rajiv Rai Bhatnagar expressed gratitude to the MHA for approving proposals of the CRPF to procure modern equipments including bullet proof vests and vehicles and AK-47 assault rifles.

The Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba, Director, IB, Heads of CAPFs and CPOs, Delhi Police Commissioner and senior officers of MHA were present during the function.

                            Two pilot projects covering about 71 Kms on Indo-Pakistan Border (10 Kms) and Indo-Bangladesh Border (61 Kms) of Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) have been completed.  The Stage has been set now for taking up Stage-II and Stage-III covering about 1955 Kms of the border which cannot be physically fenced.  The CIBMS project will vastly improve the capability of BSF in detecting and controlling the cross border crimes like illegal infiltration, smuggling of contraband goods, human trafficking and cross border terrorism etc.  

Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the project BOLD-QIT (Border Electronically Dominated QRT Interception Technique) under Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) on Indo- Bangladesh border in Dhubri district of Assam today. Interacting with media persons, Shri Rajnath Singh said earlier in the month of September, 2018, two pilot projects of “smart” border fencing built under the CIBMS programme in Jammu were operationalised. He added that over a period of time the complete border will be covered.

At Dhubri, where BOLD-QIT project has been implemented along riverine border, it was not feasible to construct border fencing. The 61 kms of border area in Dhubri where River Brahmaputra enters into Bangladesh consists of vast char lands and innumerable river channels thus making border guarding in this area a challenging task especially during rainy season.

            To address these problems Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to use technological solutions to enhance capabilities of manpower of Border Security Force (BSF) deployed on the ground. As part of CIBMS, these two projects were undertaken. Implementation of this project will help in integration of manpower, sensors, networks, intelligence and command and control solutions to improve situational awareness at different levels of hierarchy to facilitate prompt and informed decision making and quick reaction to  emerging situations.

 

CIBMS involves deployment of a range of state-of-the-art surveillance technologies — thermal imagers, infra-red and laser-based intruder alarms, aerostats for aerial surveillance, unattended ground sensors that can help detect intrusion bids, radars, sonar systems to secure riverine borders, fibre-optic sensors and a command and control system that shall receive data from all surveillance devices in real time. Implementation of CIBMS projects on Indo - Pakistan and Indo - Bangladesh border will enhance the capabilities of Border security Force (BSF).  

 

The total rollout plan for CIBMS is as under :-

Stage-I            Pilot projects in Jammu and Assam has been completed.

Stage-II           Rollout of 153 Kms in 4 patches along Indo-Pakistan & Indo-Bangladesh Border.

Stage-III         Rollout of 1802 Kms in 67 patches along Indo-Pakistan & Indo-Bangladesh border.

Stage-I of the project on pilot basis has been completed.  Stage-I will be reviewed through an independent third party auditor (IIT Delhi).  Stage-II & III will target primarily the following areas:


	Riverine, delta and estuary areas
	Waterlogged and swampy areas
	Creek areas
	Plain areas vulnerable to heavy fog
	Thickly populated areas on the border
	Hilly areas
	Tropical jungle areas
	Deserts

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh will inaugurate the project BOLD-QIT (Border Electronically Dominated QRT Interception Technique) under CIBMS (Comprehensive Integrated Border Management system) on India-Bangladesh border in Dhubri District of Assam tomorrow.  

 

Border Security Force is responsible for safeguarding of 4,096 Km long International Border with Bangladesh. At various places, it is not possible to erect Border Fence due to the geographical barriers. The 61 Kms of Border area in District Dhubri, Assam where River Brahmaputra enters into Bangladesh is consisting of vast char lands and innumerable river channels thus making border guarding in this area, a daunting task especially during rainy season. 

 

To overcome this problem, in the year 2017, Ministry of Home Affairs decided to go for technological solution besides the physical presence of manpower of BSF. In Jan, 2018, Information and Technology Wing of BSF undertook the project BOLD-QIT (Border Electronically Dominated QRT Interception Technique) and completed it in record time with the technical support of various manufacturers and suppliers. BOLD-QIT is the project to install technical systems under the Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS), which enables BSF to equip Indo-Bangla borders with different kind of sensors in unfenced riverine area of Brahmaputra and its tributaries. Now, the entire span of River Brahmaputra has been covered with data network generated by Microwave communication, OFC Cables, DMR Communication, day and night surveillance Cameras and intrusion detection system. These modern gadgets provide feeds to BSF Control Rooms on the Border and enable BSF Quick Reaction Teams to thwart any possibility of Illegal Cross Border Crossing/ Crimes.

 

The implementation of this project will not only help BSF to curb all type of cross border crimes but also provide respite to the troops from round the clock human surveillance. 

 

Earlier the Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh has inaugurated two smart fencing pilot projects of five kilometers each on India-Pakistan international border in Jammu in the month of September, last year.

                An article by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)on the Swachh Survekshan 2019 has created a wrong impression as the article is factuallyinaccurate. The Government has been addressing the issue of urban sanitation and waste management in a transparent and systematic manner under the aegis of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban). The article by CSE appears to have been written without an understanding of the robust methodology used in Swachh Survekshan-2019for ranking cities in an objective and unbiased manner.CSE has been a part of the consultative meeting held by MoHUA in July 2018 with all stakeholders and city representatives to discuss the survey methodology and parameters proposed to be adopted in Swachh Survekshan 2019.

CSE’s implication that the quality of survey was inferior since it was conducted in 28 days is erroneous. The data collection from ULBs was done every month, between September to December 2018.Only the ground level assessment and citizen feedback was done in 28 days. More than 3000 assessors were involved in the survey, and each of the 4,237 ULBs was physically visited by assessors, and every visit has been recorded through geo-tagging and time stamping of the assessors. ULBs were not informed about the exact date when the assessor was visiting their city this year, since assessors were not supposed to visit ULB’s office for any data collectionto have an element of surprise in the direct observation.

The article claims that cities that are doing good work on the ground were not awarded.  The entire data of the first part (service level progress) was based on the information provided by cities themselves on the online MIS portal, and further validated and triangulated through direct observation and citizens’ feedback. MoHUA has not received any complaint from any state or city regarding their ranks / awards in SS 2019. More importantly, the SS 2019 scores were computed based on assessments made by four (4) different independent third party agencies who evaluated different components of the survey, making the survey objective and unbiased, while adding to the robustness of the methodology. 

Finally, the article’s claim that the survey has rewarded cleanliness over sustainable waste management is erroneous. It has been publicly declared that the focus of SS 2019 was on sustaining the outcomes achieved under the SBM Urban so far. Accordingly, the indicators include sustainable ODF status (including ODF, ODF+, ODF++ certifications), sustainable solid waste and fecal sludge management practices including source segregation, daily sweeping, plastic waste management, construction & demolition waste management, collection of user charges, levy of fines, landfill remediation, sustainable waste processing for segregated waste streams, ensuring no overflow of septic tanks, and no emptying of untreated fecal sludge in water bodies, in addition to overall cleanliness of the city (including Star Rating certifications for Garbage Free cities). All these indicators are publicly available on the SBM portal

MoHUA values its partnership with all concerned stakeholders including Civil Society Organizations and has been working collaboratively with them to take forward the collective mandate of ‘swachhata’ in Urban India.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs, has stated that as cities begin to implement ‘smart’ solutions, data becomes a significant asset and enabler for data driven Governance, leading to urban transformation. While inaugurating state-of-the-art India Urban Observatory here today, he said that it will plug into the myriad sources of data from cities, both from real-time and archival sources. While inaugurating the Video Wall,  he said that it will showcase the insights gained from the Observatory and the various Missions/ offices with the idea to proactively engage with citizens/ visitors in spreading awareness about the various initiatives of the Ministry. Sh Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MOHUA, Sh Kunal Kumar, JS/Mission Director, Smart Cities Mission and senior officers of the ministry were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Hardeep Puri said that it is imperative for the empowerment of communities that cities work on using information available through various sources to improve their functioning, public services, governance systems, achievements and failures in the public domain, thereby, empowering their citizens through the access to information. He said, the future of Governance is data-driven and Indian cities are beginning to adopt this change in their functioning. He said, bringing PEOPLE in ‘focus’ needs a move towards outcome-based planning in governance. “The Observatory will help in getting reliable, up-to-date information on a meaningful set of indicators over various domains such as transport, health, environment, water, finance and so on, which will further assist in developing best practices, future strategies and policy interventions as and when required”, he added. 

Shri Puri pointed out that the conceptualisation of this Observatory recognizes the value of enhancing engagement among all four stakeholders of the ‘quadruple-helix’ model— Government, citizens, academia, and industry, along with improvements in the internal workflow and decision-making processes of city Governments. He further elaborated that the India Urban Observatory would progressively become the chief data analysis and Management Hub of the Ministry and would enable evidence-based policy formulation, capacity building of ecosystem partners on data-driven governance, foster innovation through development of newer and better use cases thereby enabling solutions at scale and speed. “It will provide scientific response to the complex challenges to urbanization through use of state-of-the-art technologies and collaborations”, he said.

The India Urban Observatory is an important component of the recently launched DataSmart Cities strategy that envisions to create a ‘Culture of Data’ in cities, for intelligent use of data in addressing complex urban challenges. The strategy aims to lay down the basic premise, three foundational pillars vis. People, Process, Platform, and a suggested roadmap for cities to improve their readiness for intelligent use of data. Making cities ‘DataSmart’ is key to realizing the full potential of technology interventions and innovation ecosystems in cities. (https://smartnet.niua.org/dsc/datasmartcity-stratergy.php). The DataSmart Cities Strategy also presents a Data Maturity Assessment Framework (DMAF), that measures the readiness and evolution of cities in their efforts to implementing the Data strategy. The assessment of cities as per the DMAF will foster a culture of data and drive innovation in India’s Smart Cities through a spirit of collaboration and healthy competition.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State(I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs has launched e-Dharti app which is a new online system where all the three main modules i.e. Conversion, Substitution and Mutation have been made online.  The  payment system in L&DO has also been completely digitized. Work is also going on other three small modules namely Sale Permission, Mortgage Permission  and  Gift Permission and will be completed soon.  The public can now submit their applications online by visiting L&DO website and are not required to visit this office for submission of them and for follow up of their applications. 

 

Land & Development Office (L&DO) deals with public applications which are mainly related to Conversion of property from leasehold to freehold, Substitution of names of legal heirs and Mutation in the name of purchaser, etc. These three applications cover almost 95% of total applications received.  The office also deals with applications related to Sale Permission, Mortgage Permission  and  Gift Permission. Lots of initiatives have been taken by this office to make the system more transparent, accountable, efficient and effective so that general public, particularly old aged, poor, ailing and deprived persons as well as women and widows, are benefitted. 

 

e-Dharti Geo Portal, another important application on which L&DO has started working, is GIS based mapping of all its approx. 65000 properties.  Through this application each and every Government  property under L&DO, whether it is allotted or still lying vacant, is proposed to be mapped on a portal called “e-Dharti Geo Portal”. Through this portal the Lessee of the property will be able to see the basic details of his/her property along with map showing its location.  The Lessee  can also be issued a Property Card from this office about his property if he asks for it.Though more than 35,000 properties have been outlined on the GIS based map all across Delhi, the actual validation is being done by checking each and every mapped property with its location and details. The whole exercise of validating all the L&DO properties and linking it with its details may take a time period of about one year.  As on date, more than 2,500 properties have been mapped and verified.  This application will not only benefit public but the Government also in getting to know the actual status of its vacant properties, whether there is any encroachment on the said property, etc.  The action already taken and the proposed ones will go a long way in streamlining the working of the office making it more public friendly, accountable, efficient and transparent.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approvedDelhi Metro's Phase -4 projectcomprising of 3 - priority corridors. The total length of these 3 corridors is 61.679 km. Out of the total 61.679 km, 22.359 km will be built underground and 39.320 km will be constructed as elevated section. These corridors will consist of 46 stations, of which 17 stations will be underground and the rest 29 stations will be constructed as elevated sections.

 

The total completion cost of three metro corridors will be Rs.24,948.65 crore.   The project will be implemented by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC), the existing 50:50 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of the Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD).

 

Connectivity Highlights:

1.   Aerocity to Tughlakabad - 15 Stations (Aerocity, Mahipalpur, Vasantkunj Sector-D, Masoodpur, Kishangarh, Mehrauli, Lado Sarai, Saket, Saket G Block, Ambedkar Nagar, Khanpur, Tigri, Anandmayee Marg Junction, TughlakabadRIy. Colony, Tughlakabad)

 

2.   R. K Ashram to JanakpuriWest - 25 Stations(R.K. Ashram, Motiakhan, Sadar Bazar, Pulbangash, GhantaGhar/SabziMandi, Rajpura, Derawal Nagar, Ashok Vihar, Azadpur, Mukundpur, Bhalaswa, MukarbaChowk, BadliMor, North Pitampura, Prashant Vihar, MadhubanChowk, DeepaliChowk, Pushpanjali Enclave, West Enclave, Mangolpuri, PeeragarhiChowk, PaschimVihar, Meerabagh, Keshopur, Krishan Park Ext., Janakpuri West)

 

3.   Maujpur - Mukundpur - 6 Stations(Yamuna Vihar, Bhajanpura, KhajuriKhas, Soorghat, Jagatpur Village, Burari)

The 3 corridors consist of both underground (22.359 km) and elevated (39.320 km) sections.

Impact: 

These corridors of phase - 4 project will expand the coverage of Metro network thereby connecting more areas of the national capital. On completion of these corridors, the Metro commuters will have more interchange stations which will connect the new corridors with the existing lines of Delhi Metro. The improved connectivity will offer commuters more options of travel by optimization of routes. The addition of 61.679 km network through these 3 new corridors will also reduce congestion on the roads and will thus help in reducing pollution caused by motor vehicles. The Tughlakabad - Aerocity corridor will further improve connectivity to the Airport. The total network length of the Delhi Metro will cross the 400 kilometre mark after the completion of these corridors.

                Indore  has been awarded the cleanest city in the country in the Swachh Survekshan 2019 (SS 2019) awards while Bhopal has been declared as the cleanest capital. Ujjain has bagged the award for being the cleanest city in the population category of 3 lakh to 10 lakh. The awards were presented by the President, Shri Ram Nath Kovind at a function here today.  Sh Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs, Sh Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MOHUA and awardees from all over the country were present at the function.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India has made remarkable progress towards achieving the goals of rural and urban sanitation.  He said, by winning the first prize in all the four surveys so far, Indore has set an example for other urban centres. The President said that cleanliness should be integral to the behaviour of every citizen to make it effective and sustainable. Many people pay attention to personal hygiene but remain apathetic to public and community cleanliness. Change in this mentality is important for achieving the goals of Swachh Bharat.

Shri Hardeep S. Puri in his address said Indore has now retained the top spot in the survey of being the cleanest city for a consecutive three years. Every year, cities and towns across India are awarded with the title of 'Swachh Cities' on the basis of their cleanliness and sanitation drive as a part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that was launched in 2014. Sixty-four lakh citizens participated in the survey which included more than 4,000 cities in 2019. Indore has reported a 70% drop in vector-borne ailments in 2019, which is being attributed to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

Stating that Swachh Survekshan 2019 has seen several innovations and best practices emerging from the cities, Shri Puri said that through a mix of innovative thinking, technological interventions and active stakeholder engagement, cities have found novel ways to address issues of sanitation and waste management in their areas. “Some of these innovations include conducting zero-waste public events, converting floral waste to value-added products, cultivating of Oyster Mushrooms from agricultural and kitchen waste in used plastic bottles, etc”, he added.

The Minister informed that we have made impressive achievements under the SBM in these four and a half years wherein Urban areas of 23 states / UTs have become ODF, and more than 94% cities are already ODF. Nearly 63 lakh individual household toilets (94% progress), and more than 5 lakh community / public toilet seats (more than 100% progress) have been constructed. Parallelly, more than 42,000 public toilet blocks across 1400 cities have been mapped and visible on Google maps. The Google toilet locator also provides an option for citizens to provide their feedback after using the toilets. Waste processing has gone up to 52% (compared to a mere 18% at the start of the Mission)

Shri Puri made a special mention of the top 20 cities in this year’s survey who have been the forerunners in Urban India’s progress towards swachhata – from large cities such as Indore, Mysuru, Ahmedabad, Navi Mumbai, Tirupati, Rajkot, Vijayawada, Ghaziabad, Surat, to smaller towns and cities such as Mul, Ambikapur, Ujjain, NDMC, Karhad, Lonavala, Vita, Dewas, Bhilai, Shahganj, and Panhala. Ambikapur in Chattisgarh got the second prize overall and has become a role model for other towns in the state. Chhattisgarh has also emerged India’s top performer among states, followed by Jharkhand and Maharashtra. 

The Minister said that the phenomenal success that this public innovation in the form of Swachh Survekshan has achieved in transforming the Swachh Bharat Mission into the world’s largest behavior change programme.   He said that in order to ensure that the momentum and efforts are sustained, we are actively considering the idea of continuing this initiative by having periodic rankings based on data being provided by cities on MIS, and citizens’ feedback, which will then feed into the larger annual survekshan at the end of each year, ensuring that the momentum garnered among cities continues unabated, and outcomes achieved are sustained in the long run. “The Swachh Survekshan exercise was started with the objective of inculcating a spirit of healthy competition among cities in their race towards becoming India’s cleanest cities. It is indeed heartening to see that this annual survey has managed to galvanize citizens also to become our partners in progress.” he added.

MoHUA conducted its first survey ‘Swachh Survekshan-2016’ survey for ranking 73 cities (Urban Local Bodies), in January 2016, under the ambit of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban).  In order to expand the coverage of cities, the Ministry conducted its second survey ‘Swachh Survekshan-2017’ in January-February 2017, to rank 434 cities. ‘Swachh Survekshan 2018’ saw a massive increase in both scale of survey and intensity of participation, with 4,203 cities covered in last year’s survey. Swachh Survekshan 2019 has scaled even greater heights, covering 4,237 cities, and that too, in a record time of 28 days, in a completely paperless, digital format for data collection! Moreover, even in this short span of time, assessors managed to visit nearly 73,000 wards, 21,000 commercial areas, 69,000 residential areas, 75,000 community/public toilets, and more than 3100 waste to compost plants across the country!

                Sh Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State(I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs has informed that the model guidelines for development and Regulation of Retirement Homes which have been prepared by his Ministry prescribe an elderly friendly built environment, physical standards and specifications. Providing details of the guidelines he informed that the Model Guidelines address the special needs and protect the rights of senior citizens and retirees living in Retirement Homes who aspire to spend their retired life independently in a safe, secure and dignified environment. The Guidelines provide option to senior citizens and family members, who are willing and can afford to purchase a living space for their parents. The guidelines states that:

 

· Retirement Homes should be aligned with the Principles, Guidelines, Norms etc. as prescribed in ‘National Building Code’ (NBC), ‘Model Building Bye Laws’ and ‘Harmonized Guidelines and Space Standards for Barrier Free Built Environment for persons with Disability and Elderly Persons’.

· Elderly friendly built environment like lifts with audio and visual signage and signalling systems, wheel chair accessibility, mandatory ramps, design of spaces to enable barrier free movement, anti-skid tiles in bathrooms and stairs, elderly friendly design of door-knobs, hand rails, furniture, etc., kitchens with gas leak detection systems, power back up facilities in corridors, lobby, lifts and apartments.

· Compliance with Green Building Principles as provided in Model Building Bye Laws and use of non-polluting and renewable energy.

· Provision of common basic services like 24X7 water and electricity supply, maintenance of proper hygiene, indoor and outdoor recreation facilities, security and housekeeping, single window facilities and helpdesk, transportation assistance, yoga and fitness facilities, care giving facilities, etc.

· Provision of basic medical, safety and security services like 24x7 on-site ambulance service, mandatory tie up with emergency facilities with the nearest hospitals and pharmacy, medical emergency room, regular medical check-up of residents, emergency alarm systems, trained and skilled security personnel, CCTV cameras in common areas, prior police verification of all the personnel deployed in the Retirement Homes.

From approximately 7.6 crore in 2001, the number of senior citizens in India, has increased to 10.4 crore in 2011. This number is expected to grow to 17.3 crore by 2025 and about 24 crores by 2050. By the end of the century, senior citizens will constitute nearly 34 percent of the total population of the country. The salient features of these Model Guidelines are:

 

· Keeping in view the requirement of independent lifestyle choice, these Guidelines provides that any person can buy such apartments but has to be solely used by a senior citizen.

· Resident of Retirement Homes will be any person who is 60 years of age or above.

· Promoter/ Developer can build and manage the Retirement Homes or engage a ‘Service Provider’ or ‘Retirement Home Operator’ for management of Retirement Homes. Such Service Providers will be required to be registered with appropriate State Authorities.

· To encourage participation of promoter/ developer to develop such projects enhanced Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is proposed.

 

Transparency in fund utilisation

· Provision of a twofold mechanism in the form of refundable Interest Free Maintenance Security Deposit (IFMS) and Maintenance Charges. IFMS to be paid by the Allottee which is refundable within a maximum period of three months from the date of refund application. Maintenance Charges to be paid by the resident on lump-sum or monthly/ quarterly/ yearly instalments on mutually agreed terms.

 

Regulation of Retirement Homes

 

· Retirement Home apartments can only be sold after registration under the respective Real Estate Regulatory Authorities of the States/Union Territories. To protect the rights of the residents a list of ‘Basic Rights of the Allottee/Resident of a Retirement Home’ has been stipulated.

                One Nation, One Card for transport mobility was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a function in Ahmedabad yesterday. The Indigenous Automatic Fare Collection System based on One Nation One Card Model i.e. National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) is the first of its kind in India.India’s First Indigenously Developed Payment system for transport consisting of NCMC Card, SWEEKAR (SwachalitKiraya: Automatic Fare Collection System) and SWAGAT (Swachalit Gate) is based on NCMC Standards.

These are bank issued Debit/Credit/Prepaid cards and the customer may use this single card for payments across all segments including metro, bus, suburban railways, toll, parking, smart city and retail. The stored value on card supports offline transaction across all travel needs with minimal financial risk to involved stakeholders. The service area feature of this card supports operator specific applications e.g. monthly passes, season tickets etc. 

The National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) to enable seamless travel by different metros and other transport systems across the country besides retail shopping and purchasesis an initiative of the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. The card will address the challenges associated with the cash payment e.g. cash handling, revenue leakages, cash reconciliation etc. Various initiatives have been taken by transit operators to automate & digitize the fare collection using Automatic Fare Collection System (AFC). The introduction of closed loop cards issued by these operators helped to digitize the fare collection to a significant extent. However, the restricted usability of these payment instruments limits the digital adoption by customers.

The customers need not carry multiple cards for different usage. Further, the super quick contactless transactions will improve the seamless experience.This will also help in higher digital payments penetration, savings on closed loop card lifecycle management cost and reduced operating cost. The rich data insights may be used by operators for business intelligence leading to efficient operation.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched today One Nation, One Card for transport mobility at a function in Ahmedabad today. The Indigenous Automatic Fare Collection System based on One Nation One Card Model i.e. National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) is the first of its kind in India.

 

India’s First Indigenously Developed Payment Eco-system for transport consisting of NCMC Card, SWEEKAR (Swachalit Kiraya: Automatic Fare Collection System) and SWAGAT (Swachalit Gate) is ased on NCMC Standards.

 

These are bank issued cards on Debit/Credit/Prepaid card product platform. The customer may use this single card for payments across all segments including metro, bus, suburban railways, toll, parking, smart city and retail. The stored value on card supports offline transaction across all travel needs with minimal financial risk to involved stakeholders. The service area feature of this card supports operator specific applications e.g. monthly passes, season tickets etc. 

 

Ministry of Housing &  Urban Affairs brought to the fore the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) to enable seamless travel by different metros and other transport systems across the country besides retail shopping and purchases.

 

Background:

 

Public Transport is extensively used across India as the economical and convenient mode of commuting for all classes of society. Cash continues to be the most preferred mode of fare payments across the public transport. However, there are multiple challenges associated with the cash payment e.g. cash handling, revenue leakages, cash reconciliation etc. Various initiatives have been taken by transit operators to automate & digitize the fare collection using Automatic Fare Collection System (AFC). The introduction of closed loop cards issued by these operators helped to digitize the fare collection to a significant extent. However, the restricted usability of these payment instruments limits the digital adoption by customers.

 

AFC System (gates, readers/validators, backend infrastructure etc.) is the core of any transit operator to automate the fare collection process. The major challenge associated with AFC system implementation in India till now is the lack of indigenous solution provider. Till now, AFC systems deployed at various Metros are from foreign players. In order to avoid the vendor lock-in and create an interoperable system, there was a need to develop indigenous standards and AFC system under Make in India initiative.

 

In order to ensure a seamless travel across metros and other transport systems in addition to retail shopping and purchases, the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) came out with the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) Program. 

 

A committee was formed with representatives from National Informatics Centre (NIC), Centre for Development of Advance Computing (C-DAC), Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) and the Ministry of Finance with an objective to develop the vendor agnostic interoperable ecosystem for NCMC including indigenous AFC System and banking interface. 

 

 NPCI was given the mandate to develop the specifications for card & terminal to support the NCMC ecosystem. Based on the best global practices and dynamics of Indian market, the committee recommended EMV based Open Loop Card with stored value as NCMC

 

CDAC was entrusted the task of finalization of NCMC specification for AFC system including the interface with Bank server. CDAC worked in collaboration with NPCI to complete this activity. Thereafter, BEL was roped in for making Gates & Reader.

 

 The Gate & Reader prototype has been made by BEL. This is the first gate and the reader which has been manufactured by an Indian company. This is also the first indigenous payment reader which has been certified as per International standards. India joins the very few elite nations who have indigenous capacity on gate and reader production.

 

NCMC Ecosystem offers the value proposition for customers as they need not to carry multiple cards for different usage. Further, the super quick contactless transactions will improve the seamless experience. For operators, NCMC ecosystem brings common standards for implementation without vendor lock-in.

 

 This will also help in higher digital payments penetration, savings on closed loop card lifecycle management cost and reduced operating cost. The rich data insights may be used by operators for business intelligence leading to efficient operation. 

 

With NCMC Ecosystem, Banks will get an access to segments which are highly driven by cash but stickiness in nature. NCMC Ecosystem will further help government in digitization of low value payments and reduced cost for the entire ecosystem. 

 

In order to showcase the entire NCMC ecosystem for digital fare collection, the complete AFC system has been deployed in Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) across few stations for field trial purpose. Under this pilot, NCMC compliant gates have been deployed at various stations of DMRC and cards have been issued by multiple banks to the users.

 

The pilot at DMRC was inaugurated by MoHUA on Jan 31st, 2019. This pilot will help to improve hardware reliability and fine tuning of the software. This will also facilitate large scale indigenous production and deployment in Indian transit system. The first level trails has been successfully completed in collaboration with CDAC, BEL, NPCI and SBI.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Construction Technology India Event, 2019 event at VigyanBhavan today.  The Prime Minister emphasized the commitment of the Union Government towards ensuring that every family’s dream of a home, becomes a reality and said that the need for the Global Housing Technology Challenge, was felt in the light of rapid urbanization in India. He said that elements from several schemes, including PM Awas Yojana, HRIDAY and AMRUT, are oriented towards transforming the housing sector. He said that adapting technology to different geographical conditions is also a challenge.

The Prime Minister said a lot of emphasis has been placed on affordable housing, real estate sector, skill development, and housing technology. He reiterated his dream that every Indian should have a proper house by 2022, and 1.3 crore houses have been made in his tenure. He called upon everyone to work together to enhance capacities and help the poor.

The Prime Minister said that the Government is also making it easier for people to buy houses, through tax and other incentives. He said the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, (RERA), has improved consumers’ confidence in developers and brought transparency in the Real Estate Sector. He said a large pool of skilled human resource has been created, especially in the rural areas. He said that in the construction sector, there is now much greater focus on disaster-resilience, energy efficiency, and local innovation. 

The Prime Minister said that the Global Housing Technology Challenge is a platform that can help elevate India’s construction ecosystem to international standards. He declared that the period from April 2019 to March 2020, will be observed as the Construction Technology Year.

Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State(I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs, Shri DurgaShanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA, officials from State Governments and representatives from industry associations were also present at the function.  During the event, the Prime Minister launched the GHTC-India mobile application, an interactive platform for all the stakeholders for facilitating exchange of knowledge on innovation and alternative housing technologies.  He also launched the 3rd Edition of the Vulnerability Atlas of India, a collation of the existing hazard scenario for the entire country.   

During his address, Shri Hardeep S Puri, stated that “Indian cities, which will contribute over 80% to GDP by 2050, need to be receptive, innovative and productive to foster sustainable growth and ensure a better quality of living.  Global Housing Technology Challenge – India (GHTC – India) essentially provides an opportunity,  under which leaders of innovative technologies from across the globe, across the diverse aspects of the construction sector spectrum, to come and participate in this grand transformation that India is going experience, he added. “From Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs we are not looking at this challenge as only a PMAY initiative, but an initiative that can have a huge impact in each of our flagship initiatives. We are looking at innovations to make our cities smarter, we are looking at construction technologies that can help us develop better civic infrastructure, we are looking at innovations that can make our waste management transformative, we are looking at ideas that will help us build better road and trunk infrastructure, we are looking  at efficient and sustainable conservation methods of our buildings and of course we are also looking at this challenge that will help us get the millions of houses built in a faster, cost-effective and sustainable manner”, he further said.  

 Providing details of the progress made in the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana(Urban), the Housing Minister stated that “Pursuing a validated housing demand of about 10 million (1 Crore), PMAY (Urban) mission has already sanctioned 7.9 million (79 lakh) houses, grounded 4.1 million (41 lakh) and completed 1.6 million (16 lakh). Looking at the scale of construction that needs to take place in the next 3 years it becomes absolutely imperative that we get the technology right. Rapid urbanization as an outcome of this sustained growth has resulted in the increase of the urban population in the country. This will exponentially increase the demand for basic services and housing in cities. Thereby it is important for us to adopt an integrated approach to provide a conducive and productive environment with better living conditions to every household in urban India. 

While welcoming the Prime Minister and participants, Shri DurgaShanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA stated that “It was Hon’ble PM’s vision that by 2022, every Indian will get a house.  To make that possible, GHTC was conceived to pole vault into the new age of construction technology.”

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Construction Technology India-2019 Expo-cum-Conference in New Delhi on 2nd March, 2019.  In response to the envisaged vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Aﬀairs, Government of India has conceptualized a Global Housing Technology Challenge - India (GHTC- India) which aims to identify and mainstream a basket of innovative technologies from across the globe that are sustainable and disaster-resilient.Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) targets the construction of 1 Crore housing units by 2022, out of which 79 lakh houses have been sanctioned by MoHUA. More than 41 lakh houses have already been grounded and 16 lakh houses are completed and handed over to beneficiaries. Within the ambit of the overarching PMAY (U), a Technology Sub-Mission (TSM) was set up, to facilitate the adoption of innovative, sustainable, green and disaster-resilient technologies and building materials for low-cost, speedier and quality construction of houses. Currently more than 12 lakh house are being built with new technologies. The GHTC-India platform aspires to provide an eco-system for the adoption of innovative technologies in the housing construction sector in a holistic manner. 

 “Construction Technology India – 2019” an Expo –cum –Conference is being organised by the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs on 2nd – 3rd March, 2019 in Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi- to identify proven, innovative and globally established technologies for use in the Indian context.  Technology providers, researchers, start-ups, developers, academia, public sector agencies and other domain experts are participating in the 2-day event.

 CTI-2019, an expo-cum-Conference will provide avenues for interaction among stakeholders that can open up new areas for  collaboration and will                                                                                                                                                       facilitate conversion of ideas into market-ready products. Potential technology providers can benefit from the support provided by Affordable Sustainable Housing Accelerators- India (ASHA-India) initiative. Youth are the main beneficiaries of this initiative.Proven technologies which are identified during CTI - 2019 will be further invited to design and build lighthouse projects of approximately 1,000 housing units each, at six places in the country. The six States are Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Tripura& Uttar Pradesh, that have competed with a total of 14 States/UTs in a competitive mode and won the opportunity to build the Light House Project. These projects will demonstrate the merits of the selected technologies and serve as live laboratories for research, testing, technology transfer, increasing mass awareness and for mainstreaming them in the country.

GHTC-India will also contribute substantially towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as laid out by the United Nations (UN), the New Urban Agenda and the Paris Climate Accord to which India is a signatory and similar international commitments by gradually migrating from inefficient & carbon intensive processes to cleaner and compliant options.GHTC-India will bring about a paradigm shift in the manner in which construction is not only done but also received and perceived in the country.

                In a decision bound to further the outreach and accessibility of Doordarshan, Prasar Bharati has brought 11 more State DD Channels, including five channels of North-Eastern States, on the Satellite footprint of India through DD Free Dish.

It is for the first time that the States of Chhattisgarh, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Uttarakhand have got their own DD Channel on a Satellite Network through DD Free Dish.



These State channels represent the regional aspirations of the local population. Providing a satellite network for these channels through DD Free Dish will not only increase visibility of these channels in the Regions, but also give them an All-India presence. 

The increased accessibility to regional broadcast will help promote regional culture and give opportunities to local talent as well.

                Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, today released a book titled ‘Mann Ki Baat – A Social Revolution on Radio’ in a function organized in National Media Centre, New Delhi. The book is based on 50 episodes of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s heart to heart talk with the citizens of India broadcast on All India Radio. 



The book sheds light on various aspects of Prime Minister’s outreach, the remarkable response it continuously received from the people, the mass movement it has inspired and the profound impact it ingrained in the minds and hearts of the youth of India.  The book also gives insight into behind the scene research work done on the massive public feedback received through various channels after every episode of Mann Ki Baat, which had aired first on 3rd October, 2014.

The book also gives a rare and exclusive opportunity to readers to discover several unknown facets of Prime Minister’s thinking and beliefs related to ‘Mann Ki Baat’, revealed by him to the authors of the book. The insights that emerge from the transcripts of the radio address are the most important contribution of this book.

                Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) and Safety in Mines, Testing and Research Station (SIMTARS) propose to explore opportunities including the feasibility of technical knowledge sharing in the area of occupational safety, health and welfare of persons engaged in mining operations and also training of key persons or members of core group from the Inspectorate, Mining Industry and Academia for formulating the process of systematic implementation and monitoring of the concept of risk based safety management system through this Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).

 

The MoU has been signed today between Shri Utpal Saha, Director General Mines Safety on behalf of Ministry of Labour and Employment and Shri Gitesh Agrawal, Queensland Trade and Investment Commissioner on behalf of SIMTARS, Queensland Government, Australia in presence of Shri Heeralal Samaria, Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment. Shri Samaria said that new technologies are required for safety of mine workers because now availability of minerals is becoming difficult and miners have to go deeper. He congratulated both the parties and expressed hope that this MoU will help to avoid loss of precious lives of mine workers.  

 

SIMTARS is considered to be a premier training and research institution under the Government of Queensland, Australia and is comprised of professionals from various disciplines of occupational safety, health and environment. SIMTARS is known to have exclusive expertise in Mines Safety Management Systems. While DGMS gains through knowledge sharing, training of officials for skill up-gradation and exposure to international best practices; SIMTARS shall gain through knowledge sharing, experiences gained by its personnel in India and imparting training to persons engaged in mining industry.

 

DGMS, the regulatory body under the Government of India, administers Occupational Safety and Health legislations with the vision to achieve nationally acceptable and internationally competitive standards of health, safety and welfare for workers employed in Indian mines. Consequently, the rate of mining accident in India dropped steadily over the years. However, the rate of decline has almost flattened since quite some time. It was realised that change in the regulatory regime might be useful for reducing this rate further down towards zero. It has been observed that the rates of mining accident in Australia are among the lowest and operating procedures adopted in their mines are among the best in the world. Australia has pioneered in conceptualising and implementing risk based Safety Management Plans for the mining sector using the technique of hazard identification and risk assessment. Other countries like, USA, South Africa, Germany and Russia followed the system thereafter.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said here that while on one hand Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi believes in the legacy of Sufi Saints to protect human values and justice, and on the other hand, he is a “nationalistic warrior” against terrorism.



 

He said that the Prime Minister is working with commitment to national security by adopting “zero tolerance” policy against terrorism. India’s spiritual and Sufi culture is the guarantee of ensuring humanity and peace by defeating and demolishing terrorism and all other forms of violence. 

Shri Naqvi offered 'Chadar' on behalf of the Prime Minister at dargah of Sufi Saint Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti on 807th Urs at Ajmer Sharif. He also read out the message of the Prime Minister in which he conveyed greetings and best wishes to the followers of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in India and abroad on the occasion of annual Urs.

The Prime Minister in his message said: “Harmonious co-existence of different religions, communities, beliefs and faith in India is the beauty of our country. Various Saints, Pir and Fakirs in our country have given message of peace, unity and harmony time to time. They have played a key role in spreading message of discipline, decency and self- restraint. Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti is the symbol of great spiritual traditions of India. Khwaja Moinduddin Chishti’s service to the humanity will inspire generations to come. On the annual Urs of this great Sufi Saint, I express my tributes to him through sending “Chadar” at Dargah Ajmer Sharif.”

People from all sections of the society welcomed wholeheartedly the “Chadar” offered by the Prime Minister.

Addressing on the occasion, Shri Naqvi said that India is in safe hands. There will be no compromise with the security of the country and its people under the strong and able leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The organizations and people, who are involved in terror activities by making Islam as their “security cover”, are the biggest enemy of the Islam. India is a role model for the entire world for social and communal harmony. We will have to strengthen this fabric of social harmony and unity. The life of Gharib Nawaz inspires us to strengthen the commitment to communal and social harmony. This unity can defeat the forces, who are engaged in the conspiracy to create divide and conflict in the society.  The “Development of the country and environment of trust” is the only agenda of the Modi Government. Our mantra is “Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas”.

On the occasion, Shri Naqvi also laid foundation stone of Khwaja Gharib Nawaz University at Kayad Vishramsthali, to be established by Ajmer Dargah Committee.  He also inaugurated Khwaja Gharib Nawaz Dispensary (OPD) at Dargah Apartment, Civil Line, Ajmer.

                A delegation of Deputy Secretaries of CSS cadre working in various Ministries/Departments of the Government called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, here today.

During the meeting, the delegation informed the Minister that the Under Secretaries of Central Secretariat Service (CSS) of the Select List for the Year 2003 have been working as Deputy Secretary on Ad-hoc basis since 2013, but they are yet to be regularised in the grade.

The Under Secretaries of the Select List for the Year 2003 upto CSL No. 5700 based on the SL of Deputy Secretary for the year 2012 have already been included in the Select List of Sr. Selection Grade (Director) of CSS for the year 2017. In other words, almost 88% Under Secretaries of Select list 2003 have already been promoted as Director and only around 50 officers from SL-2003 are left out. These officers have undergone the mandatory Level ""F"" Training in November, 2018 for promotion to the post of Director.

They said that DoPT has recently issued orders for promotion of 1756 officers in different graded in CSS and 2235 officers in the grade of CSSS in the month of December, 2018, which were pending for almost two years. But, about 50 officers from SL-2003 (Under Secretary) who are eligible for the post of Director are waiting for their promotion. They requested the Minister to intervene in the matter.

After the meeting, Dr Jitendra Singh asked the DoPT officials to look into the matter and expedite the same. He said that the Government has taken various steps to provide cordial working environment to the employees and it is committed to clear the backlog of pending promotions in the Government.

Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production 

 

 


	
	
		Natural gas production by ONGC during February, 2019 was 1953.74 MMSCM which is 8.54% higher when compared with February, 2018 although 4.46% lower than the target for the month. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-February, 2018-19 was 22539.76MMSCM which is 5.07% lower than the cumulative target but5.25% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Some of the reasons for lower production viz monthly target is decline in pressure/potential in GS-4 Gas cap reservoir in Gandhar field.
	
	


 


	
	
		Natural gas production by OIL during February, 2019 was 203.70MMSCM which is 8.92% lower than the monthly targetand2.69% lower than February, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-February, 2018-19 was 2486.78 MMSCM which is 13.03% and 5.97% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:
	
	


 


	Loss of potential in Deohal area due to presence of CO2 in production stream.
	Loss from bandh and miscreant activities in operational areas.

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan held a meeting with Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of Saudi Arabia and Chairman of Saudi Aramco, H.E. Eng. Khalid A. Al-Falih in New Delhi on 9 March, 2019. 

The meeting is a follow-up to the first State visit of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in February this year. 

This visit also reflects the intensifying engagement between the two countries in the hydrocarbon sector. Saudi Arabia is the second largest supplier of crude and LPG to India. In 2017-18, India’s crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia were 36.8 MMT, accounting for 16.7% of our total imports. 

During the meeting, Shri Pradhan referred to Saudi Arabia’s pre-eminent role as a leading producer of crude oil in the world, and in maintaining global oil market balance. He raised concerns about increasing trend in global crude oil prices. He also pointed to the need for uninterrupted supplies of crude oil and LPG to India in view of the OPEC+ cuts. Both Ministers also discussed about possible adverse impact of recent geopolitical developments on global oil market. 

The Ministers also reviewed various Saudi investment proposals in the Indian oil and gas sector, including the urgent steps to be taken to expedite the implementation of the first Joint Venture West Coast Refinery and Petrochemical Project in Maharashtra, estimated to cost US $ 44 billion, which will be the largest greenfield refinery in the world. Saudi Arabia’s participation in Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) Program was also discussed. 

Both the Ministers agreed to take concrete steps for early implementation of  the decisions taken in the oil & gas sector during the visit of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to India last month.

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Sh. Dharmendra Pradhan today handed over the Seven Croreth LPG connection under the Pradhan MantriUjjwalaYojana (PMUY). Under the scheme, deposit free LPG connection is provided to a poor household and the connection is released in the name of an adult woman. The scheme was launched on 1st May, 2016 by Hon’ble Prime Minister with an initial target of five crores, which was later revised upward to eight crores connections. 



The Seven Croreth connection has been released within just 34 months of the scheme’s launch, which is a spectacular achievement for the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Nearly 69,000 connections are being released per day. There has been huge jump in the LPG coverage in the country, having gone up from 55% in 2014 to 93%. 42% of the total beneficiaries belong to SC/ST. As per the recent data, 82% PMUY beneficiaries are going for refilling their cylinder and average refilling is about 6.5 cylinders per beneficiary.

The various milestones in the journey to 7 croreth connection are as follows:

Congratulating the women beneficiaries, Sh Pradhan said that they have been the main driving force behind this accomplishment. He said the Government has not only provided connection to the poor, but also distributed happiness to them. The scheme was launched with the identification from the SECC list, but was subsequently expanded to cover all the poor of the country. Lauding the efforts of Oil Marketing Companies, distributors, Field level Officers and all the stakeholders, he said due to their contribution, the Government could achieve the milestone of 7 crore within such a short time. The Minister said that the Government followed the principle of Sabkasathsabkavikas, and all the poor of the country are now eligible to get PMUY connection. 


Sh Pradhan said that 6800 new distributorships have been given to strengthen rural LPG supply chain. The common Service Centres have also been roped in to assist in the LPG booking and distribution. He said that the Government has also undertaken steps to strengthen the infrastructure to provide the clean and affordable fuel- Gas. He mentioned that recent laying of the Foundation stone by the Prime Minister of 9000 Crore rupee Gorakhpur-Kandla LPG pipeline is a step in this direction.

                Empowerment of women is closely linked with the country’s energy economy and this goal is driving investments in the entire value chain.  As a measure towards empowerment of poor women in the country who are bereft of access to clean cooking gas, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas has launched Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) in the form of a social movement, enabling social change and irreversible empowerment of women.

Today we have achieved another milestone under PMUY Scheme by adding 7-croreth beneficiary in the Ujjwala family. Ujjwala yojana is empowering women to lead smoke-free lives, leading to a healthier lifestyle, saving them time by greatly reducing drudgery and enabling them to pursue other income enhancement and socially rewarding pursuits.

To take this initiative forward, Pradhan Mantri LPG panchayats as peer learning platforms, are providing support, catalysing behaviour changes in Ujjawala beneficiaries and also encouraging safe and sustainable use of LPG. As many as 87,876 LPG panchayats have been conducted across the country.

Ujjwala Didi, a CSR handholding initiative, aims at creating a force of 10,000 grassroot educators who can take the three messages till the last mile, viz. (i) Clean Cooking Fuel is to be universally available, (ii) Clean Cooking fuel is affordable and (iii) LPG is safe to use and insured. Ujjwala Didis will facilitate refill, address any fear around LPG safety, help in resolving any grievances and facilitate new connections. Thus these empowered women will contribute to overall women empowerment in their panchayats. Ujjwala Didis are a living testimony of the highest possibilities of inclusive development.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has been at the forefront in encouraging women to strive forward without fear or discrimination and promoting women in leadership roles in challenging environment and difficult remote locations including offshore platforms. At the world's highest Indane LPG bottling plant situated at 11,800 ft. in Phey Village of Ladakh district, it is women power that is playing a key role in the running of the plant. The plant is operated by 11 courageous Indian Oil women in very harsh weather conditions.

In an endeavour to provide better sanitation coverage and bridge gender disparity, the Ministry has proactively undertaken an action plan to provide separate toilet facilities at all retail outlets of Oil Marketing Companies. More than 37,000 ROs are already having separate toilet facilities for men and women.

Under the Swachh Vidyalaya Abhiyan, to reduce the drop-out rate among girl students due to non-availability of separate toilet facilities, Oil CPSEs/JVs have constructed more than 20,187 school toilets. These toilets are used by more than 5 lakh girl students. More than 95% of the toilets have been constructed in rural areas. 

In an effort towards creating awareness on Menstrual Hygiene, CPSEs under Ministry of Petroleum, have taken initiatives towards installing sanitarily napkin vending machines and incinerators in various schools across India.

Recognizing the importance of women and their contribution to society, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas reaffirms its commitment for ‘economic empowerment’, ‘self-reliance’ and ‘social equality’ of women across the country.

Government endeavors to execute these contracts at the earliest so that the awardee can commence production to expedite the monetization of the hydrocarbon production from these fields.

The production from areas offered in DSF-I is likely to start as per contract timelines from 2019-20 onwards and now DSF-II areas follow, as a continuum, to add up to the domestic production and increasing the numbers of oil & gas operators in the country.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said that Indian oil and gas market, helped by progressive and conducive policy environment, have become mature and lucrative. Two international entities have bid in the 10th round and won 10 GAs. He said that the Present Government has been able to achieve historic and unprecedented results, within the same system and resources. He said that within 5 years, the coverage of City distribution area has gone up from 20% of population to 70%. He said that there is large potential in the CGD business, as we are exploring the use of LNG in heavy commercial vehicles, use of gas in steel and other industries. The Minister said the availability of cheap, clean and convenient gas will safeguard our poor from diseases. Congratulating the PNGRB for its proactive role in bringing more areas under the CGD, and completing the process in the record time, he said that besides certain small states/ UTs, big states like Haryana, Gujarat and Punjab will now be fully covered under the CGD.

 

 

10th CGDBidding Round

Encouraged with the enthusiastic participation by the industry in the 9th CGD Bidding Round and recognising the need of the country to create infrastructure for distribution of natural gas in various parts of India, PNGRB initiated the 10th CGD Bidding Round on 8.11.2018 which was formally launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 22.11.2018 at VigyanBhavan, New Delhi. 10th round covered 50 Geographical Areas (GAs) spread over 14 states and 124 districts (112 full and 12 part), covering 24% of India’s population and 18% of its area. 

The e-bidding process was initiated on 8th November, 2018, with last date for bid submission as 5th February, 2019. The bid evaluation for all 50 GAs has been completed in record period of 3 weeks.  After this round, 70% of India’s Population, 52% of Area, 402 districts spread over 27 states and union territories and the states of Delhi, Gujarat, Goa, Punjab, Haryana and Union Territories of Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Chandigarh would be fully covered with CGD.

Why Natural Gas 

Natural gas is a superior fuel as compared with coal and other liquid fuels being an environment friendly, safer and cheaper fuel.Natural Gas is supplied through pipelines just like one gets water from the tap. There is no need to store cylinders in the kitchen and thus saves space.  As per WHO database released in May 2018, India has 14 out of 15 world’s most polluted cities in terms of PM2.5 concentration.Large number of industries also consume polluting fuels like pet coke and furnace oil which emit polluting CO2. Some of the courts recently ordered for banning use of pet coke in states within their jurisdiction.  

Natural Gas (as CNG) is cheaper by 60% as compared with petrol and 45 % w.r.t. Diesel. Similarly, Natural Gas (as PNG) is cheaper by 40 % as compared with market price LPG and price of PNG almost matches with that of subsidised LPG (based on prices in Delhi). An autorickshaw owner can save Rs. 7000-8000 on his monthly fuel bill by conversion from petrol to CNG. Thus, even on cost front as well, natural gas is preferable to petrol, diesel and LPG.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi unveiled the Foundation Stones of Buxar and Khurja Thermal Power Plants digitally from Greater Noida today. These plants, 1320 MW each are situated at Buxar (Bihar) and Bulandshahar (Uttar Pradesh) respectively.

The Prime Minister said that the thermal power plants launched at Buxar and Khurja will accelerate India’s growth and will transform the power availability in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other neighbouring states. He spoke about the huge jump in power generation in the past four and half years.

Speaking about the Government’s initiative towards improving the power sector in India, Prime Minister said that his government focused on all four aspects of power generation, ie, Production, Transmission, Distribution and Connection. He said that such an approach has completely transformed the power sector and One Nation- One Grid has now become a reality. The Government has also given right impetus to renewable energy sector also, PM said. He added that his dream is ‘One World, One Sun, One Grid’.

Shri RK Singh, Union Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy graced the foundation stone laying ceremony at Chausa, Buxar in Bihar. Speaking on the occasion, he said that the Project will bring many benefits to the region. It will give impetus to the industrial development of the region and generate thousands of direct and indirect jobs for the youth.

Shri Nand Lal Sharma Chairman & Managing Director, SJVN expressed hope that the project would also act as a multiplier for employment generation and overall growth of the entire region. The project is planned to be commissioned during the year 2023-24.

The project has been planned with special features to perform as per the latest environmental norms. The project is based on Super Critical technology, closed cycle water re-circulation system for zero discharge concepts. The coal requirement for the project has been tied-up and it will be supplied by Central Coal Limited (CCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Limited (CIL) while the State Transmission Utility, Bihar has already approved power evacuation system for this project.

In terms of the Power Purchase Agreement entered into with the Government of Bihar the project will provide at-least 85% of power generated to the state which will not only reduce demand supply deficit of Bihar in terms of current power scenario but will also boost industrial activity in the state.

 The foundation stone laying ceremony at Chausa, Buxar, Bihar was graced by the Union Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Energy Minister of Bihar, Shri Bijender Prasad Yadav and People’s representatives from the area and senior officials from the SJVN.

Details of the both projects are given below:

1-  Buxar Thermal Power Project in Bihar 
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, had given its approval (on 7th March, 2019) for investment approval for 2x660 MW Buxar Thermal Power Project (Buxar TPP) in District Buxar of Bihar.

The project will be completed at an estimated cost of Rs. 10,439.09 crore and implemented by SJVN Thermal Private Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of SJVN Ltd., a Mini Ratna CPSU under Ministry of Power, Government of India.

The Buxar TPP will be based on Supercritical Technology with two units of 660 MW each, equipped with latest emission control technology to protect the environment and has high efficiency and use less fuel to generate power. The Buxar TPP will improve the deficit power scenario in Bihar and Eastern region. Govt. of Bihar has already signed Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for supply of not less than 85% of generated power.

The project is expected to generate substantial direct and indirect employment apart from various other socio-economic development in the project area. The Buxar TPP will start yielding benefits from 2023-24.

                Ministry of Power, Government of India expanded its ambitious Standards & Labelling (Star Rating) program for Energy Efficient for Appliances to cover the Microwave Ovens and Washing Machines (with revised parameters) in the country. The Star Labelling Programs has been formulated by Bureau of Energy Efficiency. The program will now include these two appliances for grant of Star Rating in terms of their energy performance. Initially, the program for above two appliances will be implemented on a voluntary basis and will be valid up to 31st December 2020.

Launching, this key initiative, Shri A. K. Bhalla, Secretary, Ministry of Power emphasised the need to improve energy efficiency in household appliances to reduce energy bills of common consumers. Speaking on the occasion he said, “This initiative will promote advancement of technology and energy efficiency in Microwaves Ovens which is becoming a popular household gadget. As regard to the launch of revised program for Washing Machines, he commended BEEs efforts to revise the criteria for inclusion of water efficiency in addition to energy performance for grant of Star Rating. We have estimated savings of over 3.0 Billion Units of electricity at consume-end through adoption of Star Rated Microwave Ovens and Washing Machines by 2030. This would be equivalent to Green House Gases (GHG) reduction of 2.4 Million-ton of CO2 by the year 2030 through these initiatives.

The size of Indian Microwave Oven market stood at 1.21 million units in year FY 2017-18 and is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 2%. Whereas, the size of Indian Washing Machine market stood at 6.1 million units in year FY 2017-18 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of around 8% fuelled by a growth in urbanization. Therefore, it is important to optimize energy performance of Microwave Ovens and Washing Machines. This will create awareness amongst the domestic consumers to encourage transition towards energy efficient microwave ovens and Washing machines. 

As a major step towards faster adoption of Standards & Labelling program and with the objective of “Ease of implementation”, BEE has developed an online registration platform for expeditious registration & approval under this initiative. The manufacturers will be able to register products online for availing appropriate star rating for respective Models / products. Any model / brand of Washing Machine or a Microwave Oven can avail Star Rating on a scale of 1 to 5 based on test report from NABL or equivalent labs subsequent to scrutiny by BEE. The representative from the manufacturers / testing labs of Microwave Oven and Washing Machine were present during the launch and appreciated this flagship program. The event was also attended by senior officials from CEA, BIS, MoP, technical partners and other key stakeholders.

Unlocking NATional Energy Efficiency potential (UNNATEE):

Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has developed a national strategy document for accelerating energy efficiency in India. The strategy document titled UNNATEE (Unlocking NATional Energy Efficiency potential) describes a plain framework and implementation strategy to establish a clear linkage between energy supply-demand scenarios and energy efficiency opportunities. The document offers a comprehensive roadmap to address India’s environmental and climate change mitigation action through energy efficiency measures. The document has now been released for larger public consultation and seeking comments/ valuable inputs from all the stakeholders.

This exercise is first of its kind, clearly delineating the energy efficiency targets for the respective demand sectors upto the state levels. Developing India’s blueprint of effective energy efficiency strategy is a leap towards stimulating energy efficiency ecosystem and enabling reduction of the pressure on demand. PwC India has assisted BEE in executing this assignment. This document has been prepared after extensive discussion with various departments, organisations and authorities.

Khurja Super Thermal Power Plant: CCEA have approved the proposal for setting up a 2x660MW Super Thermal Power Plant (STPP) in Khurja, District Bulandshahar of Uttar Pradesh at an estimated cost of Rs.11,089.42 crores and has also approved the funds for the development of the allotted coal block – the Amelia Coal Mine in District Singraulli, Madhya Pradesh at an estimated cost of Rs. 1587.16 crores. The project will be set up by THDC India Limited, a Mini Ratna CPSU under the Ministry of Power, Govt. of India.

 

The Khurja STPP will be based on Supercritical Technology with two units of capacity 660 MW each, equipped with latest emission control technology to protect the environment and has high efficiency and uses less fuel to generate power. Amelia Coal Mine was allotted to THDC India Limited by Ministry of Coal, Govt. of India in January, 2017.The Khurja STPP will improve the deficit power scenario of Northern Region and particularly of Uttar Pradesh, which has already signed Power Purchase Agreement with THDC India Limited for purchase of 60% Power from the Project and the other beneficiary states i.e Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.

 

The project is expected to generate substantial direct and indirect employment and overall development of District Bulandshahr and nearby districts of Western Uttar Pradesh. The Khurja STPP will start yielding benefits from 2023-24.

 

3. KIRU HEP : The CCEA has approved the investment sanction for construction of Kiru HE Project (624 MW) by M/s Chenab Valley Power Projects Private Limited (M/s CVPPPL), at an estimated cost of Rs. 4287.59 crore. M/s CVPPPL, is a joint venture company amongst NHPC, JKSPDC and PTC with equity shareholding of 49%, 49% and 2% respectively. 

The project is located on River Chenab in Kishtwar district of Jammu & Kashmir. It envisages construction of a 135 m high concrete gravity Dam, with installed capacity 624 MW (4 x 156 MW). The Project would generate 2272.02 MU in a 90% dependable year.

The project shall provide much needed power to the Northern grid and shall accelerate the process of development of remote areas of Jammu and Kashmir. The Project is scheduled to be completed in a period of 4 ½ years.

4. Teesta VI HEP: Teesta Stage-VI HE Project is  a Run of River (RoR) Scheme in Sirwani Village of Sikkim to utilize the power potential of Teesta River Basin in cascade manner. It  consists of construction of a 26.5 m high Barrage across river Teesta. The project would generate 2400 MUs in a 90% dependable year with Installed Capacity of 500 MW (4x125 MW).

The Project was earlier proposed to be developed by a SPV i.e. M/s LancoTeesta Hydro Power Ltd (LTHPL), promoted by the Lanco Group. However, due to financial crunch in the Company, the Project could not be completed by scheduled completion time. 

Accordingly, the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) was initiated by order dated 16.03.2018 of Hon’ble NCLT, Hyderabad Bench. In Bidding Process under NCLT, NHPC has emerged as highest bidder with Bid Amount of Rs. 907.00 crore. Accordingly, the investment proposal for an estimated cost of.Rs 5748.04 crore, being implemented by NHPC Limited, a CPSU of Government of India, has been approved by the CCEA on 07th of  March, 2019. Completion period of the project shall be 60 months.

 

5. Stressed Thermal Power Projects: The CCEA has approved the recommendations of Group of Ministers (GoM) constituted to examine the specific recommendations of High Level Empowered Committee (HLEC) constituted to address the issues of Stressed Thermal Power Projects.

 

The Government of India constituted a High Level Empowered Committee (HLEC) under the Chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary to address the issues of stressed thermal power projects. The committee made its recommendations to resolve the stress in thermal power sector and submitted its report in Nov' 18. The report of HLEC is available on the website of Ministry of Power. The Government thereafter constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) to examine the specific recommendations of HLEC and forward its comments for consideration of the Cabinet. Subsequently GoM recommended majority of HLEC recommendations.

 

The CCEA has approved recommendations of the GoM mainly relating to grant of linkage coal for short-term PPA, allowed existing coal linkage to be used in case of termination of PPAs due to payment default by DISCOMs, procurement of bulk power by a nodal agency against pre-declared linkages, Central/State Gencos may act as an aggregator of power, increase in quantity of coal for special forward e-auction for power sector, coal linkage auctions to be held at regular intervals, non-lapsing of short supplies of coal, ACQ to be determined based on efficiency, payment of Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) made mandatory, non-cancellation of PPA/FSA/LTOA post NCLT scenario and non-cancellation of PPA for non-compliance of COD. With the implementation of these recommendations, many of the issues affecting the Thermal Power Sector are likely to get resolved. 

 

6. Measures to Promote Hydropower Sector: In order to promote Hydropower sector, the Cabinet has approved the Proposal of Ministry of Power to adopt some measures. It has been decided to declare Large Hydropower Projects (LHPs i.e. above 25 MW capacity) as Renewable Energy, separate Hydropower Purchase Obligation (HPO) for LHPs commissioned after notification of the measures. Extend budgetary support for flood moderation and enabling infrastructure, i.e., roads & bridges. Methodology for tariff setting has been revised to ensure that tariff is back loaded.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved Measures to promote Hydro Power Sector. These include Declaring Large Hydropower Projects (HPO) as part of non-solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO)

 

Details:


	Large Hydropower Projects to be declared as  Renewable  Energy source (as per existing practice, only hydropower projects less than 25MW are categorized as Renewable Energy). 
	HPO as a separate entity within non-solar Renewable Purchase Obligation to cover LHPs commissioned after notification of these measures (SHPs are already covered under Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation). The trajectory of annual HPO targets will be notified by Ministry of Power based on the projected capacity addition plans in hydropower sector. Necessary amendments will   be introduced in the Tariff Policy and Tariff Regulations to operationalize HPO. 
	Tariff rationalization measures including providing flexibility to the developers to determine tariff  by  back loading of tariff after increasing project life to 40 years,  increasing debt repayment period to 18 years and introducing escalating tariff of 2%;
	Budgetary support for funding flood moderation component of hydropower projects on case to case basis; and 
	Budgetary support for funding cost of enabling infrastructure i.e. roads and bridges on case to case basis as per actual, limited to Rs. 1.5 crore per MW for upto 200 MW projects and Rs. 1.0 crore per MW for above 200 MW projects.


 

Major Impact including employment generation potential:

As most of the hydro power potential is located in the higher reaches of Himalayas and North- East Region, it will result in overall socio-economic development of the region by providing direct employment in the power sector. It will also provide indirect employment/ entrepreneurial opportunities in the field of transportation, tourism and other small scale businesses. Another benefit would be of having a stable grid considering 160 GW capacity addition by 2022 from infirm sources of power like solar and wind.

 

Background:

India is endowed with large hydropower potential of 1,45,320 MW of which only about 45,400 MW has been utilized so far. Only about 10,000 MW of hydropower has been added in the last 10 years. The hydropower sector is currently going through a challenging phase and the share of hydropower in the total capacity has declined from 50.36% in the 1960s to around 13% in 2018-19.

 

Besides being environment friendly, hydropower has several other unique features like ability for quick ramping, black start, reactive absorption etc. which make it ideal for peaking power, spinning reserve and grid balancing/ stability. Further, hydropower also provides water security, irrigation and flood moderation benefits, apart from socio-economic development of the entire region by providing employment opportunities and boosting tourism etc. The importance of hydropower is increasing even more as the country has targeted to add 160 GW of intermittent Solar and Wind power by 2022 and 40% of the total capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 to honour its Nationally Determined Contribution for Climate Change. However, DISOMS are reluctant sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) Hydro Power due to higher tariff, particularly, in the initial years. One of the reasons for high tariff of hydropower is the loading of cost of flood moderation and enabling infrastructure in the project cost. In this backdrop, the decision has been taken to adopt measures to promote hydropower sector including providing budgetary support for flood moderation cost and enabling infrastructure cost and tariff rationalization measures to reduce tariff and thus the burden on the consumer.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister has approved the recommendations of Group of Ministers (GoM) constituted to examine the specific recommendations of High Level Empowered Committee (HLEC) constituted to address the issues of Stressed Thermal Power Projects.

The CCEA has approved recommendations of the GoM mainly relating to grant of linkage coal for short-term PPA, allowed existing coal linkage to be used in case of termination of PPAs due to payment default by DISCOMs, procurement of bulk power by a nodal agency against pre-declared linkages, Central/State Gencos may act as an aggregator of power, increase in quantity of coal for special forward e-auction for power sector, coal linkage auctions to be held at regular intervals, non-lapsing of short supplies of coal, ACQ to be determined based on efficiency, payment of Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) made mandatory, non-cancellation of PPA/FSA/LTOA post NCLT scenario and non-cancellation of PPA for non-compliance of COD. With the implementation of these recommendations, many of the issues affecting the Thermal Power Sector are likely to get resolved.

Background:

The Government of India constituted a High Level Empowered Committee (HLEC) under the Chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary to address the issues of stressed thermal power projects. The committee made its recommendations to resolve the stress in thermal power sector and submitted its report in Nov' 18. The report of HLEC is available on the website of Ministry of Power. The Government thereafter constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) to examine the specific recommendations of HLEC and forward its comments for consideration of the Cabinet. Subsequently GoM recommended majority of HLEC recommendations.

                Today, Hon’ble Minister of Railways and Coal Shri Piyush Goyal, launched 3 projects which will enhance passenger experience and modernise Indian Railways. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Piyush Goyal announced that all Mountain Railways of Indian Railways will now have Vistadome Coaches. Latest addition of Vistadome coach is in Nilgiri Mountain Railway. The Minister added that given the positive feedback to this initiative of Indian Railways, order for hundred Vistadome coaches has been given to the concerned production unit of Indian Railways. 

Speaking about Station illumination project, Shri Goyal said that to impart airport like look to the station, 190 stations have been illuminated with LED lighting. This will also ensure better security of the passengers. He also informed that 500 Railway stations have been identified for illumination at par with Airport standard.

Shri Goyal also congratulated the officers of Indian Railways for implementing the e-office project in a time-bound manner.

1. Station Illumination

As part of its endeavour to provide facilities at Railway Stations at par with ‘Airport standards’, Indian Railways has taken initiative to improve illumination at its Railway Stations at par with ‘Airport standards’. Out of 190 Stations (which were either State Capitals or Million Cities or cities of strategic/religious/tourist importance) selected for improvement in illumination level at par with ‘Airport standards’, till date 100 stations have already been upgraded and work at other Stations is going on at a rapid pace. They are also likely to be completed by April, 2019.

Further, due to overwhelming response received from public, it has now been decided to improve illumination levels at 500 additional Stations.

2. Vistadome Coaches 

Indian Railways has a number of scenically beautiful routes. Vistadome coaches have been designed to provide panoramic view to the passengers while enhancing their travelling comfort on these routes. These coaches have large windows on the sides and glass panels on the roof to provide better viewing experience.

Three vistadome coaches are running between Dadar and Madgoan, in Araku Valley and in Kashmir Valley. Four hill railways have already been provided with vistadome coaches as well. In total 13 vistadome coaches are presently available:

Darjeeling Railway – 4 coaches

Kalka Shimla Railway – 2 coaches

Kangra Valley Railway – 1 coach

Matheran Hill Railway – 1 coach

Now, 2 MG coaches have been modified to vistadome coach by Golden Rock Workshop, Tiruchirappalli for Nilgiri Mountain Railway. With this addition, now all 5 hill railways will have vistadome coaches.

These projects together will provide better experience to passengers, enhance digital connectivity and will help Indian Railways become the growth engine of New India. 

3.  e-office project

E-Office project is a Mission Mode Project (MMP) under the National e-Governance Programme of the Government of India. The project aims to usher in more efficient, effective and transparent inter-government and intra-government transactions and processes. Indian Railways will now shift from manual filing system to E-office for its day to day activities to bring transparency and efficiency in functioning. RailTel, a Miniratna PSU under Ministry of Railways, has taken up the work of implementing e-Office system for Indian Railways. 

E-office will benefit millions of employees of Indian Railways. It will enhance transparency, increase accountability, and promotes innovation.

                Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal laid the foundation stone for New Coaching Terminal at Nemom and unveiled WAP-7HS passenger locomotive through video conferencing here today. Shri Ghanshyam Singh, Member (Traction), Railway Board, Shri Rajesh Agarwal, Member (Rolling Stock), Railway Board, Shri Vishwesh Chaubey, Member (Engineering), Railway Board and other Senior Railway Officers were present on this occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Piyush Goyal said that the present Government has consistently focused on development for all areas in the country. Focus has been on large scale infrastructure creation both physical and social. 

The Minister informed that this new coaching terminal at Nemom in the Thiruvananthapuram Division will help in decongesting the already overloaded current coaching terminals. With the commencement of work at this new coaching terminal, Indian Railways can start providing large number of new trains which will either originate or terminate in Thiruvananthapuram. 

He further informed that there is no Unmanned Level Crossings in the entire state of Kerala and all the stations have been converted into 100 % LED lighting. Indian Railways is committed to faster development of Kerala and committed to make Kerala a better tourism destination which will help transform the local economy and give a big boost to the generation of the employment and improve customer amenities and facilities for all the people using trains in Kerala. Indian Railways has started 3 new trains in Kerala namely Kochuveli - Indore Weekly Express, Thiruvananthapuram - Nizamuddin Weekly Express via Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram - Nizamuddin Weekly Express via Alleppey.

Shri Goyal expressed his happiness on the occasion of unveiling 100% indigenously developed Make-in-India high speed WAP-7 HS Locomotive which has been developed by Railway engineers completely in-house at Chittaranjan Locomotive Works. 

Shri Goyal congratulated all the engineers, workers and the entire railway family for one more feather in their cap to promote Make-in-India, to make India a hub of invention, innovation and manufacturing and to make India manufacturer of indigenously developed modern equipment which will help not only to improve the facilities for Indian Railways but will help to export to the rest of the world and earn foreign exchange and will be providing people the new job opportunities under Make-in-India programme.

Shri Goyal further said, “The most powerful passenger locomotive over the Indian Railways which will be capable of hauling 24 coaches instead of 140 Kmph now at 160 kmph has been designed and manufactured at CLW by our own engineers and by our own workers making the entire nation proud of the Indian engineering talent and Indian skilled manpower talent. This new engine will help us serve the larger distances much faster and will reduce pollution level and will improve the operation initially of the premium trains.”

 

Salient features and facilities being developed at Nemom:

This Terminal will facilitate introduction of additional trains to/from Thiruvananthapuram area and remove the congestion being faced at Thiruvananthapuram Central station & Kachuveli.  

Thiruvananthapuram Central is an important station in Kerala and maintenance facilities are being provided at Kochuveli station. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop Coaching Terminal at Nemom to serve the people of the area which would reduce congestion at Thiruvananthapuram Central station. Nemom is considered ideal for origination/destination of trains. Coaching lines, Pit lines, Stabling lines with shunting neck, integrated sick lines facilities, RRI panel & associated building, connectivity to the proposed Vizhinjam International Container Terminal and booking office are proposed to be provided for operating trains to/from Nemom.

 

Development of High Speed WAP-7HS Locomotive



WAP-7 is the most powerful passenger locomotive over Indian Railways capable of hauling 24 coaches high speed trains. However, the maximum service speed of locomotive is 140 kmph. To operate the trains at faster speed and reduce the journey time, enhancing the maximum service speed of locomotive is necessary.

            Indian Railway has undertaken project of upgradation of speed potential of WAP-7 locomotives from 140 kmph to 160 kmph. Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) turned out new version of WAP-7 locomotive (WAP-7HS) having potential of maximum service speed as 160 kmph. The complete design and development of locomotive have been done indigenously. The necessary simulation and modelling are carried out by CLW in-house. To enhance the speed of the locomotive, a weight reduction of about 14 tonnes have been carried out.  The gear ratio has also been changed from 3.6 (72:20) to 3.2 (70:22). The software modification has been carried out to optimize slip-slide control and tractive effort. The locomotive shall be put into service after statuary tests and trials. The new type of locomotive is expected to facilitate operation of premium trains such as Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duranto at higher speed.

                The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the construction of a 3rd railway line between Narayangarh in West Bengal & Bhadrak in Odisha of 155 kms length. At a total cost of Rs. 1,866.31 crore it is slated for completion during the year 2023-24.

The construction of the third line will help create capacity to cope with existing as well as additional traffic. The busy section between Narayangarh and Bhadrak is mainly used for the movement of coking coal to steel plants as well as the movement of export ore from the areas of Chakradharpur to several ports. Therefore, this 3rd line will help in easier movement of coal. This will help steel plants, power plants as well as the export industry, which will boost the economies of Odisha and West Bengal, and entire East India.

Third line will ease congestion on this route. Narayangarh – Bhadrak section forms a part of the Howrah-Chennai trunk route. The present utilization (with maintenance block) of the section between Narayangarh & Bhadrak is to the tune of 138% as per Line Capacity Statement 2014-15. Over and above the heavy freight traffic, the route has to accommodate 47 pairs of coaching trains including high-speed trains like Bhubaneswar Rajdhani, Howrah-Yesvantpur Duronto, Howrah-Puri Duronto, Sealdah-Puri duronto & Howrah-Puri Shatabdi Express. This makes it highly congested.

The project will also help generate direct employment for about 37.2 lakh mandays during construction, and has the potential to generate indirect employment as well.

                RRBs had invited online applications against Centralized Employment Notification (CEN) No. 02/2018, published by RRBs on 10.02.2018, for a total 62,907 vacancies. Record number of 1,89,78,913 online applications were received. World’s largest Computer Based Test was successfully conducted on 51days from 17.09.2018 to 17.12.2018 in 152 shifts.The result of the above Computer Based Test was announced on 04.03.2019.

Para-7 under the Head “Important Instructions” of the Centralized Employment Notification(CEN) 02/2018, it has been stated that marks secured by the candidates would be subjected to normalization.

Now large number of candidates have represented on the result declared by RRBs and the method adopted for the same. For the above Computer Based Test no new method of preparation of result has been introduced.  The short listing of candidates has been done purely on candidate’s merit and by the following time tested method of normalization:- 

Normalized Score for a candidate (Xn) 

Xn=(S2/S1)*(X-Xav)+Yav, where


	
		
			
			S2
			
			
			Standard Deviation (SD) of the shift with the Highest Average Score taken as base for normalization
			
		
		
			
			S1
			
			
			Standard Deviation for the shift whose marks are to be normalized (to be scaled to S2)
			
		
		
			
			X
			
			
			Raw score of the candidate 
			
		
		
			
			Xav
			
			
			Simple average of the Shift
			
		
		
			
			Yav
			
			
			Average corresponding to shift with highest Average (taken as base for normalization) 
			
		
	


 

All RRB examinations/Computer Based Test held since 2000 have followed this normalization method.

It is not uncommon that on normalization, marks secured by a candidate would go more than the total marks of the exam paper.  In the previous examinations of RRBs, there have been instances where normalized marks of candidates were more than the total marks. In CEN-02/2018 results there is nothing unusual because raw marks secured by the candidates are crucial indetermining their normalized marks.

The maximum normalized marks of any candidate in Level-1 (CEN-02/2018) Computer Based Test(CBT) is 126.13.  Any other marks higher than this, is pure concoction.

Before publication of results, all candidates were made privy to the Question Papers, Master Answer Key and their own evaluated answer sheet.  The ‘Objection tracker’ was accessible to candidates from 14th January 2019 to 20th January 2019.  During this 1.58 lakh candidates submitted their objections which were considered and reviewed.

It may be noted that in addition to 1.5 lakh jobs, Railways will also be recruiting 2.3 lakh more people over next two years. Taken together with the ongoing process, the total number will be a 4 lakh jobs by Indian Railways.

                Minister for Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal today addressed the media on the five-year achievements of the ministries under his charge. Shri Goyal released a booklet highlighting the achievements in the Railways and Coal Ministries in the past five years. Chairman, Railway Board, Shri V.K. Yadav, other Railway Board Members, Secretary, Ministry of Coal, Shri Sumanta Chaudhuri and Senior Officials of Railways and Coal were present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Goyal said, “There has been tremendous progress in last 5 years. Both, Ministry of Railways & Coal has taken up new projects at large scale & implemented them swiftly with an honest approach.” Applauding the vision & able leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the Minister added that the vision and leadership defines the success of any organisation. Shri Goyal reiterated that the focused approach of the Government in last 5 years has materialized various projects for the benefit of Nation & people. He urged the people of the country to put their suggestions in the popular Mann Ki Baat show for taking up further developmental projects.

Highlights of Achievements & Initiatives of Ministry of Railways:-

In the past five years, the Government has made safety the foremost priority of Indian Railways. Indian Railways has achieved its best ever safety record in 2018-19 - there has been 81% drop in number of deaths from 152 in 2013-14 to 29 this year (upto Jan 31, 2019). This is a result of holistic efforts. All Unmanned Level Crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge network have been eliminated. Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) fund of Rs. 1 lakh cr has been created for safety expenditure.

Laying the foundations of infrastructure for a New India, there has been a quantum leap in capital expenditure. Total capital expenditure between 2014-19 is Rs. 5.1 lakh crore which is more than double of total expenditure during 2009-14. Railways is connecting India at a faster pace with a 59% increase in the average pace of commissioning New Line / Doubling / 3rd & 4th line projects from 4.1 Kms during 2009-14 per day to 6.53 Kms per day during 2014-18.

Aspirations of the people of North East were fulfilled with completion of 4.94 Kms long Bogibeel Bridge, longest rail-cum-road bridge in India. Now, journey from Itanagar to Dibrugarh is only 180 Kms, reducing the travel time from 24 hrs to only 5 hrs

Commuter travel in urban India has been given sufficient attention. Bangalore Suburban System is being developed with ongoing projects worth more than Rs. 15,700 cr. This will benefit about 15  lakh commuters. Mumbai Suburban Systems is also being modernised with ongoing projects worth more than Rs. 70,000 cr, which will benefit about 75 lakh commuters.

India entered a new era of mobility with Vande Bharat Express - India's first high-tech, energy-efficient, self-propelled train. This is a prime example of the success of Make in India movement. This train will be proliferated across India and also exported globally.

The Ahmedabad-Mumbai High-speed Rail (HSR) will revolutionise the transport sector in India through speed, safety and service. Besides the Make in India benefits from the HSR project, Railways is creating large scale employment and economic development through sanctioned projects in Latur, Maharashtra; New Bongaigaon, Assam; Lumding, Assam;  Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh and Sonipat, Haryana. Setting records for Indian Railways, Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh has successfully executed world’s 1st ever conversion of diesel locos into electric loco to enable Mission Electrification.

Railways has embarked on transitioning to sustainable rail transport with a six times increase in electrification from 610 RKM during 2013-14 to 4,087 RKM during 2017-18. 100% Electrification of Broad Gauge Routes of Indian Railways is targeted by 2021-22.

Railways has achieved significant milestones in moving the country’s economy faster with the highest ever freight loading in 2018-19. Freight earnings have touched their highest level and is expected to be about Rs. 1.43 lakh cr in BE 2019-20.

Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) are gateways to India’s superfast growth and development. First sections of Eastern DFC (Bhadan to Khurja, 200 Kms) and Western DFC (Rewari to Madar, 200 Kms) have been completed.

Railways is improving passenger services including a complete makeover of Stations by installing modern facilities including escalators, lifts, free wifi etc. and using local art in the design. 4 stations are undergoing redevelopment - Habibganj, Gandhinagar, Charbagh and Gomtinagar. Beautification of 65 stations has been completed using local art. Railways has improved trains and coaches including launching the Tejas, Antyodaya and Humsafar trains and Deen Dayalu and Anubhuti coaches. Connecting passengers to the digital world, high speed WiFi service has been provided at more than 800 stations. Pan India rollout of paperless Unreserved Ticketing (UTS) has been done to make ticketing convenient and hassle free.

Catering has also been a focus area with compulsory printing of MRP on all food items and use of artificial intelligence to monitor food production in base kitchens for improving quality and hygiene.

Offering its tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and contributing to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, Railways has paid attention to hygiene with efforts such as record installation of Bio-toilets, third party independent surveys, integrated mechanized cleaning and On Board Housekeeping Services (OBHS)

Indian Railways is also playing its part in promoting tourism and providing a wonderful experience to tourists. It is also connecting Indias to their roots with the launch of Ramayan Express, Panj Takht Express, and Buddhist Circuit Train.

Rail Drishti dashboard has been launched, encompassing all the digitisation efforts in Indian Railways and promoting transparency and accountability. It brings information from various sources on a single platform and gives access to key statistics and parameters to every citizen of the country. The available information has been categorized under 15 user friendly sections on the Dashboard.

India’s first National Rail & Transportation Institute has been launched with 1st academic session started with two undergraduate programmes - B.Sc. in Transportation Technology & BBA in Transportation Management with 103 students. Rs. 421 crore has been sanctioned for next 5 years.

Recognising the significance of empowering and upskilling the Railways family, various steps have been taken including delegation of powers. Historic recruitment drive is being undertaken with 1.5 lakh vacancies being filled. 2.3 lakh individuals will be recruited over next two years.

Indian Railways has also focused on digital initiatives for bringing transparency and accountability to its business practices. E- reverse auction policy has been issued. 100% e- Procurement is being done through a single web-portal. Simpler approval processes in Research Designs and Standards Organisation have reduced process time from 30 months to 6 months.

Highlights of Achievements & Initiatives of Ministry of Coal:-

Coal powers the million aspirations of India. To ensure energy security, reduce imports and realise the vision of 24x7 Power for All, Coal India has enhanced drilling, production & offtake of coal. 105 MT increase in coal production since 2014 took almost 7 years to achieve before 2013-14. Production target of Coal India is 610 MT in 2018-19. As a result of record performance, number of coal plants with critical stock is only 4 out of 125 (as on 20th February, 2019) compared to 2/3rd coal plants with critical stock in 2014.

Further, to boost the power sector, superior Coal Quality has been ensured with steps such as third party sampling procedures and 100% crushed coal to power plants. Coal India is also delivering benefits of reduced cost of electricity as now amount of coal required to generate per unit of electricity (specific coal

consumption)has been reduced by 8% since 2014.

Brining the spirit of reform to coal sector, Commercial Coal Mining, the most ambitious reform in Coal Mining after Nationalisation in 1973 was introduced. This will reduce import dependency and bring energy security through assured coal supply. Further, transparent e-auction and allocation of coal blocks has led to successfully auction of 85 coal mines. Rationalization of coal linkages has led to total rationalisation of 61 MT with annual potential savings of about Rs. 3,651 crore (till date). Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala Transparently in India (SHAKTI), for auction and allotment of coal linkages, will lead to affordable power and transparency in allocation of coal. 16 Fuel Supply Agreements have been signed under this scheme. Timeline for 14 critical projects for evacuating coal has been established for time bound execution to increase coal transportation.

Railways and coal together are the Engine of New India. Tremendous progress has been made in both these sectors to reform and modernise them. These steps will empower every ordinary Indian and set foundation for a New India.

                Union Minister for External Affairs Smt Sushma Swaraj, Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Shri Arun Jaitley; and Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stones for development of 8-lane access controlled Dwarka Expressway and Delhi-Mumbai Expressway in Delhi today. The ministers also inaugurated the Jaipur Ring Road through a video link on the occasion. Minister of State for RTH, Shipping, Chemicals & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, MoS Planning (I/C) and Chemicals and Fertilizers Shri Rao Inderjit Singh, MoS Sports (I/C) and Information & Broadcasting Col Rajyavardhan Rathore, and Chief Minister of Haryana Shri Manohar Lal were also present on the occasion. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Smt Sushma Swaraj said, the three projects are a gift for Delhi and Haryana. She said that the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will change the future of Mewat region, and will bring it on industrial map of the country. She appreciated that over 20 lakh new trees will be planted on these new roads, and these roads have the potential of becoming tourist attraction in near future.

 

Shri Arun Jaitely said, the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will link two most important freight centres of the country, and will boost economic activity and generate great employment opportunities. He appreciated Mr Gadkari’s efforts in developing the National Highway network in the country, and said, he has successfully brought up this sector to building of 29 kms of National Highways against a mere seven kms earlier. He informed that nearly 91 per cent of country’s villages are linked with main roads. 

 

Shri Nitin Gadkari said, while developing expressways and highways, full attention is being given to minimising pollution levels. He said, the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, Dhaula Kuan flyover, etc will definitely reduce traffic congestion thereby improving the air quality in the city. Delhi- Mumbai Expressway will also speed up the development and smart cities will develop along them generating vast employment opportunities for the local people. He said, projects worth over 15 lakh crore are underway in the Ministry, and these are being taken up with full transparency, in a corruption-free atmosphere. He said, all projects are being completed within time schedules.

 

The Delhi-Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway is conceived as a 1320 km greenfield project with an estimated cost of Rs 90,000 crore. The existing Delhi-Mumbai National Corridor (NH-8 section of the Golden Quadrilateral) is one the busiest and most critical routes of the national highways network, witnessing an average traffic of more than 80,000 PCUs per day. Considering the present traffic scenario, it was decided to develop an alternative alignment connecting Delhi with Vadodara, which on linking up with the proposed Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway, would create seamless connectivity between Delhi and Mumbai and improve the efficiency of this highly trafficked National Corridor. The proposed Delhi-Vadodara-Mumbai road will result in overall reduction of about 150 km in the present distance between Delhi and Mumbai. In addition, Delhi-Vadodara expressway would also act as an expressway to Jaipur via the already developed Jaipur-Dausa NH-11. The expressway will also reduce the distance to other important economic centres of Kota, Bhopal and Indore from Delhi (through spurs of intersecting NHs being developed under Bharatmala) by about 100 km.

 

The Delhi-Vadodara Expressway is being taken up in 5 phases at a cost of Rs 45000 crore. Bids have been invited for all these phases and are at various stages of finalization. The Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway, is being constructed in three phases at a cost of Rs 45000 crore. Work has been awarded for a part of Phase I and will be done for the remaining phases this year. 

The 29 km Dwarka Expressway (NH-248BB) being built at a cost of Rs 9,000 crore will start from Shiv Murti to terminate near Kherki Daula on NH-8. This section of NH-8 is a part of Delhi-Jaipur-Ahmedabad-Mumbai arm of Golden Quadrilateral and Delhi-Gurgaon section is presently carrying traffic of over 3 lakhs PCUs, much beyond the designed capacity of this highway, leading to severe congestion. Keeping this in view, Dwarka Expressway has been conceived as a bypass of Gurgaon. This Expressway stretches 18.9 Kms in Haryana and 10.1 Kms in Delhi. It is also proposed to provide western connectivity to Indira Gandhi International Airport from Dwarka side from this expressway, providing alternate connectivity to the airport for west Delhi and Haryana. The expressway will also provide direct access to upcoming Exhibition-Cum-Convention Centre in Sector 25 of Dwarka. 

 

The 57 km long six-lane Jaipur Ring Road has been completed at a cost of Rs 1217 crore. It connects NH-11 (Agra Road), NH-8 (Ajmer Road), NH-12 (Tonk Road), and NH-12 (Malpura Road). The project involved construction of two ROBs, a flyover, two major bridges, 20 minor bridges, 32 VUPs and 31 culverts. The project envisages considerable reduction in traffic congestion and pollution in Jaipur city.

                The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has decided to mandate advanced braking systems, technologies and performance requirements for improved road safety and reducing accidents. The provision will be binding on all vehicles with 9 seats and above. A notification to this effect was issued yesterday. The existing vehicles will be required to adopt new provisions with effect from April 2021, while all new vehicles rolling out from April 2022 will have these pre-fitted.

This includes mandatory fitment of Anti lock braking system, introduction of stringent braking performance, endurance braking requirements, intelligent braking system to assist drivers in managing braking force, and electronic stability for better stability and to reduce roll over. With this, Indian braking regulations will be at par with European standards.

                The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has prescribed a common standard format and design of the Driving Licence and the Certificate of Registration for the entire country. A notification to this effect was issued on 1st March 2019.

The option of providing a paper or booklet based driving licence or the registration certificate has been done away with. Now, such certificates can only be provided in two types of cards viz. a PVC based card or a Poly Carbonate one. Detailed specifications have been prescribed for these cards in the notification. The enriched specifications are of high standard and would enable durable and quality cards. 

The State Governments have been given the option to decide on the type of material of the card to be provided. Further, the optional features of providing a chip based smart card or a contact less features (NFC) has also been provided which the States can prescribe. A QR code has been prescribed on the cards. This would enable easy linking and access and validation of the information on the cards with the SARATHI or VAHAN database. As the Ministry had recently issued amendments of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989 enabling transport related documents in an Electronic Form, the QR would facilitate the enforcement authorities.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari received a report on Hybrid Simulation for Traffic Mapping and Modelling for easing traffic congestion in big cities. The objective of the study was to prepare Hybrid Model and utilize it for preparing and testing short term and long terms strategies/interventions to remove traffic congestion in Delhi. The scope of the model can be extended to the entire Delhi NCR region and similar models can be built for other major metropolitan cities of India. This model is also useful in understanding the impact assessments of various upcoming infrastructure projects like, roads, flyovers, underpasses and other rapid transit projects. 

The report has been prepared by a JV between Medulla Soft Technologies Private Limited-Transport Simulation Systems, Spain. The study, aimed at creating one of the most dynamic traffic models of the world with extremely high traffic density and more than 900 intersections, was awarded through Indian Academy of Highway Engineers - a subsidiary of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia through its Transport and Innovation Hub (Research Centre for Integrated Transport Innovation) played an advisory role in completion of the project. 

This model can help replace various traffic feasibility studies, demand assessments for individual projects etc. The model can be updated every two years with relevant traffic data so as to make it useful over the next coming years.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will inaugurate a four-lane flyover at Dhaula Kuan junction near Dhaula Kuan Metro Station on NH 8  tomorrow. The flyover, which will reduce waiting time at the traffic light by 30 minutes at peak hours, is the first step towards development of an eight-lane, signal free Dhaula Kuan – Airport corridor. 

National Highway No.8 (New NH-48) is the prime link providing connectivity to IGI Airport from Delhi and NCR. The frequent traffic jams in the corridor results in travel time of 10-30 minutes in crossing this stretch of about 3 kms. NHAI has taken up development of signal free corridor from Dhaula Kuan interchange to Airport at an estimated cost of Rs.270 crore.  The work on the project commenced in March, 2018.

The project has huge challenges in terms of traffic management of about 3 lakhs PCUs per day, presence of a large number of Civil and Defence utilities, shifting of Defence infrastructure and getting security clearances.  The work on the project started 274 days back, out of which work could not be executed on 136 days on account of security restrictions and environmental prohibitions. So the work of the flyover was completed in a record time of just 136 working days. 

Besides the flyover being inaugurated tomorrow, the complete signal free Dhaula Kuan – Airport corridor  consists of widening of Dhaula Kuan – IGI corridor from 6-lanes to 8-lanes,  a three-lane flyover from Janakpuri road to merge with NH-8, three-lane vehicular underpass at Parade Road junction, 3 PUPs, 2 VUPs and an FOB for pedestrians. 

This project would be in addition to the nine other projects being implemented for decongesting NCR Delhi. These include  the 22 km, 6-lane elevated corridor on Gurugram-Sohna Road costing Rs 2000 Crore on which work has started; 8-lane Delhi-Panipat highway from Mukarba Chowk to Panipat on NH-1 being constructed at a cost of Rs 2300 and nearly 48 % done; the 29 km, 8 lane access controlled Dwarka Expressway costing about Rs 9500 crore on which work has started; package II, III and IV of Delhi-Meerut Expressway costing Rs 5900 Crore, where package II is  36 % done, package III in 76% done and package IV is 32    % done; 4 laning of 124 km Khekra – EPE junction to Shamli-Saharanpur (NH-709 B) at a cost of about Rs 1200 Crore; Rangpuri Bypass to connect Dwarka/NH-08 with Vasant Kunj-Nelson Mandela Road at a cost of Rs 1000 Crore, which is in DPR stage; 75 km Urban Extension Road (UER-2) third Ring Road for Delhi under Bharatmala to be developed at a cost of Rs 4000 Crore which is in DPR stage and the 31.3 km, 6-lane access controlled corridor from Akshardham NH24 Junction to EPE Junction on Baghpat Road at a cost of about Rs 2600 Crore.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone for yet another National Highways project to decongest Delhi and the NCR region today.  The proposed 59 km long, six-lane, access-controlled highway will connect the Ring Road-DND junction to the interchange of Delhi-Mumbai Expressway at KMP, passing through Kalindi bypass and Faridabad-Ballabhgarh bypass. It will bring down the traffic congestion that this area faces, and will also help to bring down pollution levels.  The cost of this project is estimated at Rs 3580 crore.

Addressing a public gathering on the occasion, Shri Gadkari assured that work on this highway will begin within two months and the entire project will be completed in two years’ time. He thanked the state governments of UP, Haryana and Delhi for their cooperation in the project. Underlining the prospective development of the region, Shri Gadkari called upon Haryana to consider developing new townships of Faridabad and Gurugram on the lines of Navi Mumbai. Reiterating the government’s commitment for developing the capital city on international standards, providing world class transport amenities and reducing the high levels of pollution, Shri Gadkari said that highways projects worth over Rs 5000 crore are underway to decongest NCR Delhi. 

 Minister of State for Planning (I/C) and Chemical and Fertilizers, Rao Indrajit Singh said, roads are key to economic development of any country. He said, the national highways projects that the government has implemented over these last five years will go a long way in bringing prosperity to the country. 

Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishna Pal Gurjar equated the work of the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways with that of the Bullet Train, as highways construction work has gone up from 10 kms to over 30 kms per day. 

The access-controlled highway project will have 3+3 lane service roads on either sides for about 29 km, 7.350 km of elevated section with two level crossings at four locations of Metro line, 18 new underpasses, and nine interchanges with improved junctions. The project will decongest Delhi with reduction of traffic congestion in Ashram-Badarpur-Faridabad-Ballabhgarh region. This is expected to result in reduction of vehicular pollution.

This project would be in addition to the nine other progects being implemented for decongesting NCR Delhi. These include the 3 km signal free corridor from Dhaula – Kuan to Airport at a cost of Rs 280 Crore, which is about 40 % completed; the 22 km, 6-lane elevated corridor on Gurugram-Sohna Road costing Rs 2000 Crore on which work has started; 8-lane Delhi-Panipat highway from Mukarba Chowk to Panipat on NH-1 being constructed at a cost of Rs 2300 and nearly 48 % done; the 29 km, 8 lane access controlled Dwarka Expressway costing about Rs 9500 crore on which work has started; package II, III and IV of Delhi-Meerut Expressway costing Rs 5900 Crore, where package II is  36 % done, package III in 76% done and package IV is 32    % done; 4 laning of 124 km Khekra – EPE junction to Shamli-Saharanpur (NH-709 B) at a cost of about Rs 1200 Crore; Rangpuri Bypass to connect Dwarka/NH-08 with Vasant Kunj-Nelson Mandela Road at a cost of Rs 1000 Crore, which is in DPR stage; 75 km Urban Extension Road (UER-2) third Ring Road for Delhi under Bharatmala to be developed at a cost of Rs 4000 Crore which is in DPR stage and the 31.3 km, 6-lane access controlled corridor from Akshardham NH24 Junction to EPE Junction on Baghpat Road at a cost of about Rs 2600 Crore.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the continuation of the Biomedical Research Career Programme (BRCP), and Wellcome Trust (WT) /  DBT India Alliance beyond its initial 10-year term (2008-09 to 2018-29) to a new five year phase (2019-20 to 2023-24) with Department of Biotechnology (DBT) increasing its commitment to two times that of WT.

The total financial implication will be Rs. 1092 crore with DBT and WT contributing Rs.728 crore and Rs.364 crore respectively.

Over its 10 years of funding in a 1:1partnership, the Programme has fulfilled its objectives of building and nurturing talent of highest global standards in cutting-edge biomedical research in India, which has led to important scientific breakthroughs and applications to meet societal needs.

BRCP has made it attractive for high quality Indian scientists working abroad to return to India, and has increased the number of locations geographically within India where world-class biomedical research is undertaken.

In the extending phase, the Programme would continue to build this capacity as also strengthen clinical research and work towards addressing important health challenges for India.  Continuation of the Programme with increased stake from the Government of India is important to bring about these returns.

                Contributions of women are now well recognised by the society globally in all kinds of endeavours. It has now been proved beyond doubt that women have no less potential than their male counterparts given the equal opportunity and encouragement in any field of activity whether it is academics or sports or business etc... The current Government has made concerted efforts to empower women in all walks of life. Ministry of Science and Technology has also initiated several schemes to enrol and encourage women to take up science and technology as their career choice. 

In a message Union Science & Technology Minister, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that it is heartening to note on this International Women’s Day that our efforts during the last four and half years have yielded impressive results. “In 2014, the Department of Science and Technology took a giant step forward and brought all the women-centric schemes and programs under one ambit named KIRAN (Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through Nurturing).” said Dr. Vardhan. 

Outlining some of the key initiatives Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that we have supported eight women-only Universities under the umbrella of CURIE (Consolidation of University Research for Innovation and Excellence in Women Universities) a programme towards development of research facilities and infrastructure. “To enhance skills and promote self-employment among women, we have trained around 10,000 women for skill development in various areas such as quality control, industrial microbiology, cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants, mushrooms, bamboo, fruit processing, value added agriculture, etc.”, further mentioned the Science Minister.

Expressing pleasure Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that our work for women empowerment has also been appreciated and recognised. “The President of India Conferred Rani Lakshmibai Award (Nari Shakti Puraskar 2015) to Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), which is an autonomous institution of my ministry, for its work for women empowerment in R&D through Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) training and today more than 10% of active patent professionals in the country are from this programme.”  

In his concluding remarks Dr Harsh Vardhan expressed hope and confidence that the initiatives undertaken in the recent past in the long run would result in producing future women leaders in Science and Technology. 

As per the official statistics, around 14% are women out of total 2.82 lakhs R&D personnel directly engaged in R&D activities. In order to narrow down the gender gap and improve the under-representation of women in the field of Science & Technology, several programmes have been initiated in the recent past. Today an exclusive session viz. Women Science Congress is organised and is an integral part of the Indian Science Congress every year where women scientists deliberate on various issues related to women and women scientists.To recognise outstanding women scientists, awards such as Janki Ammal Women Bio-scientist Award and SERB Women Excellence Award, etc. are conferred and today women scientists are facilitated to visit prestigious foreign institutions for undertaking research and training.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and U.K. on Cancer Research Initiative. The MoU was signed on 14th November 2018.

Details:

The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative will identify a core set of research challenges that address issues of affordability, prevention and care of cancer by bringing together leading Indian and UK experts across clinical research, demographic research, new technologies and physical sciences. The initiative will provide funding to develop new research alliances and undertake impactful research to enable significant progress against cancer outcomes.

Funding pattern:

Over 5 years, the total research funding for the Initiative shall be £10 million (approx. Rs. 90 crores). CRUK's share for such funding shall be £5 million (approx. Rs. 45 crores). DBT shall match such funding by £5 million (approx. Rs.45 crores). The matching funds will be as per prevailing rates at the beginning of financial year.

Impact: 

Despite the surge in technological, biomedical, clinical, and pharmaceutical innovations aimed at improving cancer outcomes, the overburdened healthcare systems across the globe remain ill equipped to meet the massive burden of escalating cancer care costs. The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative sets forth a roadmap for catalysing collaborations that align the best researchers, scientists, healthcare organizations and institutions to a multi-disciplinary research platform leading to high value, low cost outcomes for cancer care. Through this initiative the number of positions for doctoral-level, post-doctoral level researchers and early career scientists are expected to grow. They will not only be trained in cutting technology but will also be trained in essential leadership and project management skills which would help them in securing tenure-track research positions in academia or in related bio-pharma industry.

 

Background:

The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative is a collaborative 5-year bilateral research initiative by the Department of Biotechnology(DBT), Ministry of Science & Technology, India and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) that will focus on affordable approaches to cancer. Both CRUK and DBT will invest £5 million (approx. 45 crores) each in this 5-year pilot, and seek further investment from other potential funding partners. This is a follow up of the joint statement issued by the two Prime Ministers during the visit of Prime Minister of India; Shri Narendra Modi to UK on April 18, 2018, which states the following:

""As thriving democracies, we share a desire to work closely together and with all who share our objective to support a rules-based international order that upholds agreed international norms, global peace and stability. Together the UK and India are a forcefor good in an uncertain world. We are sharing our experience and knowledge to tackle global challenges. India's Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Cancer Research UK propose to launch a £10 million (approx. Rs. 90 crores) bilateral research initiative which will focus on low cost approaches to cancer treatment.""

                In a press interaction in New Delhi the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, Prof. K. Vijay Raghvan shared details of the nine national missions guided by the Prime Minister Science, Technology & Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC). 

Prof. Raghvan said that science and technology is the fulcrum for the levers of government to effect social and economic change. For this, scientists and society must connect closely; build stronger foundations in education, fundamental research, applications in agriculture, health, environment, energy etc. The PM,s STIAC aims to facilitate, through its missions, the process of collaboration and focus needed to solve complex problems in a reasonable time-frame.

Prof. Raghvan told that the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) to the Government of India is catalyzing collaborations across scientific ministries, research institutions and industry partners, through the PM-STIAC, to leverage cutting edge scientific research for societal benefit. “In this regard the PSA’s office has held 4 meetings of the PM-STIAC since October 2018 and key national missions emerged from the discussions, which are being driven by the PM-STIAC through the PSA’s office. Each mission is being led by a lead Ministry and will engage international and national institutional partners, young scientists and industry.” said the PSA

Prof. Raghvan further stated that the nine missions of national importance through the PM-STIAC, aim to understand and conserve our biodiversity and develop sustainable processes, leverage precision health for personal wellbeing, recover wealth from waste, develop and use artificial intelligence, quantum computing, connected mobility solutions and other technologies to address frontier scientific questions and our challenges, thereby enabling sustainable development for India and, indeed, the planet.

The PSA also detailed new policies and programs which are also being implemented by the PSA’s office as guided by the PM-STIAC, to build on India’s rich cultural and traditional practise, to position India as a pioneer in the areas of biodiversity research, deep ocean exploration, teaching science in our languages, to create an impact at the grass-roots and become a modern yet inclusive economy. 

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi recently referred to his Science, Technology & Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC)’s work on challenges in science and identifying solutions for societal problems through technology and innovation. The Prime Minister’s Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC) in an overarching Council that facilitates the PSA’s Office to assess the status in specific science and technology domains, comprehend challenges in hand, formulate specific interventions, develop a futuristic roadmap and advise the Prime Minister accordingly. PSA’s Office also oversees the implementation of such interventions by concerned S&T Departments and Agencies and other government Ministries.

                The Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport and Highways, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari inaugurated two multi purpose berths - No14 & No. 16 at Deendayal Port at Kandla through video conferencing today. He also laid the foundation stone for the Central Inland & Coastal Maritime Technology- IIT Kharagpur. In addition to this he also inaugurated a Multi Skill Development Centres (MSDC) in Maritime Logistics under the Pradhan MantriKaushal Kendra (PMKK) programme of MSDE at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust. 

Speaking on the occasion Shri Gadkari said that all three developments are very significant for the maritime sector and the socio-economic development of the country. He said the two shipping berths at Kandlawill increase the port's capacity by over 115 lakh tonnes. Larger ships will be able to anchor at the port, enabling handling of larger volumes of cargo. This will help lower logistics costs and bring prices down. Further, the Minister said that the Deendayal Port has been making very good progress, and along with Chabahar Port, it will play a very important role in the country’s maritime trade, giving a boost to the country’s economy. 

The two multi purpose berths have been constructed at a cost of Rs 280 Crore.The Optimal Capacity of each berth is 4.50 MMTPA and they are designed for vessels of size 75000 DWT Each berth has a draught of 13.0 m. The project consisted of construction of construction of a wharf of 300 Mts. x 55 Mts and development of back up area of 21.0 Ha at each berth. Both projects were completed in 22 months, that is two months ahead of the scheduled completion time of 24 months.These Multi-purpose Cargo Berths will not only add to the port capacity, but will also help in reducing the congestion in the port to a great extent. The Multi-purpose Cargo Berths No. 14 & 16 will allow the port to handle bigger ships and larger volumes of cargo. This will result in direct & indirect employment opportunities and economic prosperity in the region.

Speaking about the state-of-the-art Centre for Inland and Coastal Maritime Technology (CICMT)  being setup at IIT, Kharagpurunder Sagarmala programme Shri Gadkari said that the project is of strategic long-term interests for the port and maritime sector of the country.He said the centre will be a hub for latest technology tools for maritime sector and reduce India’s dependence on foreign institutions. It will also reduce the cost of research drastically and result in cost and time savings for work in the Port and Maritime sector. 

CICMT is being fully funded under unique and innovative projects under Sagarmalato address the long felt need for applied research and development for the inland waterways sector. At the moment there is no testing and experimentation facility available in the country for inland and coastal vessels for which the shipbuilders have to approach various European countries. TheCICMT at IIT Kharagpur will provide technological support, research, testing and experimentation facility to the Ministry of Shipping and its subordinate offices such as Inland Waterways of India, Cochin Shipyard Limited and major ports.

This Centre will focus on following domain areas:-


	Ship Design for Coastal/Inland waterways
	Shipbuilding Technology and Structural Design
	Transport Systems & Logistics
	Cryogenic Cargo Handling
	Green/Renewable Energy harvesting from Coastal and Inland waters
	Automation and AI for Maritime Operations 


The cost of the project is Rs. 69.20 cr. (Capex - Rs. 61.05 cr. and Opex - Rs. 8.15 cr.). The funding for CICMT is for 5 years only and once the facility is functional, revenues generated from the end users will make it sustainable.CICMT setup signifies a major leap in indigenous innovation and cutting edge technology support to the Port and Maritime sector directly contributing to the Sagarmalaprogramme  and support ‘Make in India’ and  is based on close collaboration amongst government, academic institutions and industry to make applied research relevant to day to day ground work in the port and maritime sector. 

Talking about the Multi Skill Development Centres (MSDC) in Maritime Logistics being set up at JNPT, Shri Gadkari said that the centre will provide skill development in Maritime Logistics and placement to over 1050 students per year in Port and Maritime sector. This  is a step towards achieving 100% skilled manpower at all Major Ports and will ensure that local people are able to truly reap the benefit of development in their areas. 

The key training areas at the centre are warehouse management, consignment and tracking, inventory management, EXIM trade documentation and other related courses in the maritime logistics domain. The physical infrastructure has been provided by JNPT and CIDCO and the centre will be managed and operated by the reputed logistics company AllCargo Logistics Ltd.

The Multi Skill Development Centre at JNPT will meet the upcoming skill manpower need in the surrounding areas. .Three major projects namely, the SEZ which is supposed to pre-dominantly be a logistics hub, the Navi Mumbai International Airport which would provide opportunities in fields as diverse as cargo handling and hospitality, and JNPT’s new terminal - the PSA Bharat Mumbai Terminal, will see a demand for highly skilled logistics manpower. It is expected that the trainees trained in MSDC can provide skilled manpower for these projects and beyond.  

The financial support in form of a soft loan of uptoRs. 70 lakh for lab setup, and funding requirement for training has been provided by Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship through their schemes Pradhan MantriKaushal Kendra (PMKK) and Pradhan MantriKaushalVikasYojana (PMKVY).  The job roles for training will be as per sectoral and locational needs and will be aligned to the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) of the Govt. of India. The MSDC model is also being replicated in other ports in the country. It is likely to be taken up at Chennai Port, Cochin Port and Vishakhapatnam Port in the next phase.

                A National Conference on “Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)”was inaugurated today by the Union Minister of Social Justice & EmpowermentShriThaawarchandGehlothere today. He delivered the key note address on the detailed account of the scheme. The Conference was organised by theDepartment of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri RamdasAthawale, Secretary, DEPwD Smt. ShakuntalaDoleyGamlin, senior officers of the Ministry and about 600 delegates from across the country participated in the conference.  

 

The objective of the conference was to sensitize the stakeholders of the scheme i.e. Programme Implementing Agencies (PIAs), District level officers & State Government officers. Earlier the DEPwDorganizedthree Regional Conferences at Secunderabad on 22.12.2018, Mumbai on 17.01.2019 and Kolkata on 18.02.2019 covering the Southern, Western, Central, Eastern and North-Eastern regions of the country. 

 

Delivering inaugural address, Shri Gehlot said that the “7th Guinness Book of World Record” has been created by DEPwD yesterday at Bharuch, Gujarat where ‘Modern Artificial Limbs (Legs)’ wereimplanted on 260Divyangjans within eight hours. DEPwD has already created Six World Records in other categories. It is a very proud moment for the DEPwD as well as for all Divyangjans of our country. 

 

He expressed his happiness that ISLRTC under DEPwD has recently prepared a Directory comprising 6000 words for the hearing impaired Divyangjans and more than 1700 hearing  impaired children have been treated with Cochlear Implant Surgery and almost all of them are now leading a normal life. DEPwD has also provided ‘Motorized Tricycles’ to the Divyangjans nationwide for their smooth movement and Department of Transport is helping them. He announced that so far, 28 States have provided ‘Universal ID Cards’ to around 13 Lakh Divyangjansand very soon it will be provided to all Divyangjans of the country. He dwelt upon many new initiatives and achievements of the DEPwD and Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment for betterment and welfare of Divyangjans and downtrodden people of our country. 

 

Shri Gehlot opined that the NGOs and Self Help Groups play a very important role in the proper implementation of the government schemes. When government’s welfare schemes get decentralized, these schemes succeed more. He said that the recommendations of such conferences are sent to the Policy Planning authorities of the government to frame the important policies.He informed the audience that now the official procedures regarding Divyangjan’s certifications and sanctioning of grants have been simplified very much so that Divyangjans and NGOs working for them may not suffer anymore. 

 

Shri RamdasAthawale in his address said that the Government is committed to the welfare of Divyangjans and socially backward people of our country. He briefed on many new initiatives and achievements of DEPwD and Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.

Smt. ShakuntalaDoleyGamlin, Secretary, DEPwD highlighted the need for creation of an inclusive society that accepts and respects persons with disabilities without discrimination.

An ‘Interactive Question & Answer Session’ also held as a part of it, in which queries of the participants were addressed. A few of the organizations who are receiving financial assistance under DDRS shared their views and experience by way of making Presentations.

 

The conference was to disseminate the provisions of the revised scheme and to sensitize various stake holders about it. This conference provided a unique opportunity for interactions amongst all stakeholders to ensure exchange of cross-sectoral views on the aspects of the efficacy of the scheme as well as the scope of improvements in it. Ithad a profound impact on the implementation of the DDRS for the welfare of the Divyangjan. It sensitized the PIAs about the major changes brought about in the revised scheme and created awareness among major stakeholders, viz. State Government and District Level Officers and NGOs in popularizing the scheme further, thereby promoting the well-being of Divyanjans (Persons with Disabilities).

                Ministry of Steel organized a two-day Vigilance Conclave in New Delhi which concluded today. The Conclave was aimed at sensitizing the officials of Steel PSUs on the basic principles and procedures to be followed while taking important administrative and commercial decisions relating to various functions including procurements, contracts, personnel and finance. 

Inaugurating the conclave yesterday, Central Vigilance Commissioner Shri K.V. Chowdary said transparency and accountability are the cardinal principles of decision making. He stressed upon having a strong internal whistle blower mechanism in every organization. The CVC also emphasized that there are enough in-built safeguards in the law to protect honest and upright officers.

Secretary Steel Shri Binoy Kumar, said that at times, lack of knowledge and awareness of good practices result in flouting of rules and procedures, which can be avoided. He impressed upon the participants to understand the nuances of vigilance administration to facilitate their working.

Joint Secretary and CVO of the Ministry of Steel Ms.Ruchika Chaudhary  Govil said vigilance is integral to management of any organization. She said the aim of organizing the conclave is to help reduce opacity, delays and discretions, which often result in matters being embroiled in vigilance. 

In the 2-day conclave, basic issues concerning vigilance, adherence to rules and regulations relating to public procurements, transparency in tendering processes, e-procurement, GeM, GFR, e-auction, ethics in governance, complaint handling system and other matters of importance were deliberated upon. 

Chairman SAIL Shri Anil Kumar Chaudhary, CMD MECON Shri Atul Bhatt and CMD RINL, Shri A K Rath were also present in the inaugural function. 

Around 100 senior officials of the PSUs of the Ministry of Steel, namely SAIL, RINL, NMDC, MECON, KIOCL, MOIL, MSTC, FSNL, Bird Group of Companies and OMDC participated in the conclave.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the Scheme to Rebate State and Central Embedded Taxes to Support the Textile Sector. This will enable the Government to take various measures for making exports of apparel and made-ups zero rated. 

Details:

At present, apparel and made-ups segments are supported under the Scheme for Rebate of State Levies (RoSL). However, certain State as well as Central Taxes continued to be present in the cost of exports. The Cabinet decision provides for a scheme to rebate all embedded State and Central Taxes/levies for apparel and made-ups which have a combined share of around 56% in India’s textile export basket. Rebate of taxes/levies has been permitted through an IT-driven scrip system at notified rates. 

Benefits:

The proposed measures are expected to make the textile sector competitive. Rebate of all Embedded State and Central taxes/levies for apparel and made-ups segments would make exports zero-rated, thereby boosting India’s competitiveness in export markets and ensure equitable and inclusive growth of textile and apparel sector.

                Union Textiles Minister, Smriti Zubin Irani, inaugurated the renovated Handloom Haat in New Delhi today. She also launched three projects of NIFT - VisionNXT – Trend Forecasting Initiative, Indian Textiles and Craft Repository and Design Innovation and Incubation. The Haat at Janpath in New Delhi has been set up by Ministry of Textiles to provide marketing opportunities to authentic handloom products from various States, PSUs and cooperative societies.  Its main objective is to provide infrastructure support to handloom agencies to augment their sales of handloom products and to showcase the exquisite variety of handloom products produced all over the country. Textiles Minister also released a booklet - World Handmade Textile Biennales on this occasion.

 

Speaking on this occasion, Smriti Zubin Irani said that this is an effort to recreate history and revive the history of art. She said the NIFT will accomplish their job through artificial intelligence. The Textiles Minister further said that the virtual museum will not only help industry and research scholars but also carry forward the knowledge to the next generation. MoS Textiles, Ajay Tamta, also spoke on this occasion.  

 

Project related to trend innovation lab ‘VisionNxt’ initiativebeing set up by NIFT in the building will create an indigenous fashion forecasting service that endeavours to design seasonal directions for our country. The trend forecasting service would be aligned to our national and sub-national socio-cultural constructs and market requirements. The proposed service is based on the premise that fashion is a dynamic industry, depending on seasonal trends and forecast to predict its future direction.  It will help handloom sector in production of handloom products as per market requirement in terms of trends, design and colour forecast.

 

The project of Indian Textiles and Craft Repository Initiative of NIFT is supported by the DC Handlooms and the DC Handicrafts, Ministry of Textiles. The body of textile and craft knowledge generated through the Craft Cluster Initiative will be channelled into a national knowledge portal titled Indian Textile & Craft Repository. This repository will also house the virtual registers of the textiles and crafts resources, which are available in the Weaver Service Centres, the Crafts Museums, similar institutions and private collections. The repository will develop a virtual museum of textiles, and textile crafts, a designer archive, indigenous case studies, and also act as aggregator of online information on related research. Virtual museum will be set up having digitised resource of traditional archived pieces from museums, resource centres, weavers’ service centres. It will also have contemporary pieces and collections from designers, fashion archives.  This will help in easy sourcing of designs.

 

Design Innovation and Incubation (DII) is intended to support young entrepreneurs, artisans, start-ups, NIFT alumni and students.The DII would also facilitate collaborations relevant for business development. The target beneficiaries include NIFT alumni and students who would like to start entrepreneurial ventures as well as candidates who have not been a part of NIFT but wish to take up NIFT incubation support.

 

It has been decided to set up incubation facilities (Regional Incubators) in Mumbai, New Delhi and Bengaluru campuses of NIFT in the following areas:

1.         Textile for Apparel, Home & spaces (Delhi)

2.         Smart wearable systems (Bengaluru)

3.         Fashion and Lifestyle accessories (Bengaluru)

4.         Apparel including Athleisure and Activewear (Mumbai)

The three locations have been proposed keeping in view the presence of industry, advisors, mentors and experienced NIFT faculty.

                Ministry of Tribal Affairs organized a meeting with the officers of the State Governments dealing with the issues relating to the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 yesterday.  The meeting was chaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Tribal Affairs and was attended by the officers representing 20 State Governments who are respondents in the Writ Petition (Civil) filed by Wildlife Trust of India (Case No. 50/2008 & 109/2008).  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the provisions of the Act and to carry out effectively the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court given by it during the hearing of the case on 28.02.2019.  

While the exact directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court were not available during the meeting as the written order has not been received, it was conveyed that States should formulate a time-bound Action Plan to take up suo-motto review of all rejection cases involving claims of individual rights and these are brought before the District Level Committee (DLC) which is the final appellate authority under the Act. It was also conveyed that proper procedure as per the Act and rules thereunder for examination of the claim applications at all levels i.e Gram Sabha, Sub-divisional Level Committee and District Level Committee should be fully adhered to by the States. All States should carry out an accurate assessment of the finally rejected cases at the District Level Committee after taking into account the possibility of duplicate applications requiring de-duplication. Cases rejected on wrongful grounds as detected by SDLC/DLC should be excluded from the list of rejected cases.  There is need to doubly ensure that no eligible person is rejected.  In each case, the decision taken should be also conveyed to the claimant in writing.  Further, it was conveyed that information should be separately compiled for STs and OTFDs.  State Governments should complete the review processes and file their affidavits before the Hon’ble Supreme Court by 10.07.2019.  

It was also emphasized that meetings of the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) should be held early and the members of these Committees in the States should be aware of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court so that the Committee can carry out its duty of effective review and monitoring of the procedures being adopted by the various authorities while deciding the cases as well as conveying the decision to the applicants/claimants.  

It was also emphasized that the concerned line officials including forest officials should be made fully aware of the provisions of the Act and rules thereunder through regular training and capacity building programmes.

                The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on March 20, 2019 was 54.002 BCM, which is 33% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 35% for the week ending on March 14, 2019. The level of water storage in the week ending on March 20, 2019 was 109% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 98% of storage of average of last ten years. 

The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 161.993 BCM which is about 63% of the total storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.

                President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind will present the Nari ShaktiPuraskar 2018, the highest civilian honour for women in India, at a special ceremony to be held in RashtrapatiBhavan, New Delhi, on International Women’s Day tomorrow. To acknowledge women's achievements, the Ministry of Women and Child Development confers Nari Shakti Puraskaron  women and institutions in recognition of their relentless service towards  the cause of women empowerment and social welfare. This year, 44 awardees have been selected for these Puraskar, out of around a thousand nominations received by the Ministry.

The  Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said, “All the awardees are a face  of change, reflecting the shift in the status of women in the country, from women development to women-led development. I congratulate all of them for their achievements. I would like to highlight that for these awards we received several nominations from all over the country across  all the sectors. No field has been left untouched, where women have not left their indelible mark, making women the leading force of our development trajectory. I thank all concerned for sending nominations and letting us know about the remarkable work of women of our country. I appreciate the contribution of each one of them and hope that they will continue working for the cause of a better society.”

This year, the Nari Shakti Puraskar has also been awarded to a One Stop Centre (OSC) and to a state which has shown exceptional progress in improving child sex ratio at birth under the BetiBachaoBetiPadhao scheme. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is establishing One Stop Centres for violence affected women in all districts of the country. One Stop Centres are being developed to provide 24x7 integrated services to women affected by violence under one roof, including  handholding them  in filing of FIRs, providing them legal aid, medical aid, psycho-social counseling and temporary shelter upto 5 days. BetiBachaoBetiPadhao is a flagship initiative of the Prime Minister touching women rights and women empowerment at the most initial foundational stage of their lives.

Forthe Nari Shakti Puruskar, 2018, wide publicity was done through advertisements in leading newspapers across the country for inviting nominations. Nominations were invited from State Governments/UTs/Central Ministries/Departments and from the previous years’ awardees (2015-2017). Self-nominations were also welcomed.

While making the selection from the nominations their contribution in empowering vulnerable and marginalized women was  taken into account. Further, efforts were also made to include women who have contributed to spheres and issues which have gained utmost importance and focused attention in the last few years. This year, among the awardees are scientists, entrepreneurs, environmentalists, social workers, farmers, artists, masons, woman marine pilot, woman commando trainer, journalists and film-makers and many others, who have faced their own unique  challenges, but have not been deterred from achieving their dreams. The awardees have contributed in their unique ways to the society, impacting lives of people and are role models and an inspirations to many others.

The Government of India believes that empowering women is empowering the nation. The Ministry of Women and Child Development reaffirms its commitment to empowering women by making them an integral part of the nation’s developmental journey. The Ministry salutes the exceptional strength of Nari Shakti Puraskar awardees, who are role models for generations to follow.

                 The Ministry of Women and Child Development hosted a felicitation event for Web Wonder Women, a campaign organised to celebrate the exceptional achievements of women, who have been driving social reforms via social media. As many as 30 women, who were selected after an extensive research process, were honoured by the Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi in New Delhi, on 6th March, 2019.

Organised in collaboration with Twitter India and Breakthrough India, the event aimed to recognise the fortitude of Indian women stalwarts from across the globe who have used the power of social media to run positive campaigns to steer a change in society.

 

 

""Women online, though niche, are a very powerful voice. #WebWonderWomen was a campaign to recognise, honour and encourage such voices that have in their own capacity driven a positive impact on social media platforms,"" said Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Union Minister for Women and Child Development. 

The WCD Minister, along with a panel of 10 judges, finalised the names of 30 women who have impacted and influenced society through social media. The women were selected from over 240 nominations received under the categories media, awareness, legal, health, governmental, food, environment, development, business and art. 

On 8th March, the Ministry honours women who have contributed to society but have remained unsung with the Nari Shakti Puruskar, which is conferred by the President of India at Rashtrapati Bhawan. Along with these Puruskars, the Ministry  started a new system of recognising women who have broken the glass ceiling and ventured into unusual fields. In 2018, the Ministry hosted 'First Ladies', a first-of-its-kind Government initiative to felicitate exceptional women who were the first to set a milestone in their respective fields. In 2015, the Ministry had collaborated with Facebook to recognise '100 Women Achievers' who have excelled in diverse sectors of public work. These women were hosted by His Excellency the President of India. Web Wonder Women' is the third leg of the ‘Women Achievers’ campaign of the Ministry.

                To shape India’s continued ascendancy in FinTech, build the narrative for future strategy and policy efforts, and to deliberate steps for comprehensive financial inclusion, NITI Aayog organized a day-long FinTech Conclave in New Delhi today. The Conclave featuredrepresentatives from across the financial space – central ministries, regulators, bankers, startups, investors, service providers and entrepreneurs.

MrShaktikanta Das, Governor of RBI inaugurated the Conclave in the presence of Mr Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog and MrSubhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. 

Giving the keynote address on ‘Opportunities and Challenges of FinTech’, Mr Das noted that FinTech has the potential to reshape the financial services and financial inclusion landscape in India in fundamental ways. He said, “We have to strike a subtle balance between effectively utilising FinTech while minimising its systemic impacts. By enabling technologies and managing risks, we can help create a new financial system which is more inclusive, cost-effective and resilient.”

Mr Kant noted the need to evolve regulatory and policy paradigms keeping in mind the need of nearly 450 million millennials of India to access institutional credit and charting out the future of fintech in India in light of digital technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence. 

Government of India’s efforts focused on Digital India and developing India Stack including Voluntary Aadhaar for financial inclusion have evoked significant interest from various stakeholders in the area of Financial Technology (FinTech). 

India is one of the fastest growing FinTech markets globally and industry research has projected that USD 1 Trillion or 60% of retail and SME credit, will be digitally disbursed by 2029. The Indian FinTech ecosystem is the third largest in the globe. 

The Indian FinTech industry is creating cutting edge intellectual property assets in advanced risk management and artificial intelligence that will propel India forward in the global digital economy while simultaneously enabling paperless access to finance for every Indian. 

The Conclave constituted parallel tracks, which looked into various dimensions of the future of the FinTech, particularly the areas of:


	Digital Onboarding of Customers and Merchants for Financial Inclusion 
	Building Financial Products for Bharat
	Emerging Areas of FinTech
	Fast tracking investment in FinTech industry
	Financial Inclusion of MSMEs


The group on fast tracking investment in FinTech sector outlined the need for open banking to be introduced in India and data aggregation utilities be facilitated within innovative frameworks such as regulatory sandboxes. The group also sought to explore introduction of a new sub-class of Non-banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) exclusively for fintech-centric companies to encourage innovation and targeted policy, while also increasing avenues for investor capital. 

The track dealing with digital onboarding of customers and merchants for financial inclusion recommended bringing clarity to existing policies, and ensuring consistent and formal guidelines are evolved through consensus among the regulators and the stakeholders. The group also explored the scalability and cost affordability of proposed solutions, with proper awareness generation with regard to risk mitigation and fraud prevention.

Looking at the emerging areas of FinTech, the group considered opening up access to data within a larger framework of informed consent and adequate privacy safeguards. The group discussed the need for India to lead the digital asset revolution, which shall boost India’s technical competitiveness and also create cutting-edge jobs. Expanding the roles of business correspondents to supply financial services rather than just banking services and establishing a single source of aggregated, anonymised, consent-governed data was recommended as crucial towards ensuring proper data governance. 

To build financial products for Bharat, deliberations revolved around introducing 100% paperless and presence-less eKYC and eSign. Designing customised credit products for nearly 450 millennials, particularly the 2/3rds who continue to belong the underserved regions of the country, was deemed necessary to expand access. Light touch, integrated regulation to enhance inclusion to bottom-of-the-pyramid users without additional regulatory burden for NBFCs. 

The group focussing on financial inclusion of MSMEs recommended increasing funding sources and capital supply for MSMEsby introducing sectoral caps and increased margin size. Building capacity by creation of ‘smart MSMEs’, expanding access to alternate data sources for underwriting and democratising access to government-led MSME ecosystem were other recommendations brought forward. 

Going forward, the above recommendations shall be fleshed out and further detailed for feasibility of implementation through cross-sectoral consultations by the NITI Aayog, who has been mandated with expanding digital literacy and promoting financial inclusion.

                The NITI Aayog and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) organized the first workshop on development of the India Energy Modelling Forum (IEMF), which has been envisaged as a pan-stakeholder platform for debating ideas, scenario-planning & discussing the India's energy future.

The two-day workshop, being held with the support of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), was organized under the Sustainable Growth Pillar of the India-U.S. Strategic Energy Partnership. The inaugural session of the workshop was chaired by Dr Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog and Mr Mark A. White, Mission Director, USAID India.

The IEMF seeks to provide a platform for leading experts and policy makers to study important energy and environmental issues and ensure induction of modelling and analysis in informed decision making process. The Forum aims to improve cooperation and coordination between modeling teams, the Government of India, knowledge partners and think-tanks, build capacity of Indian institutions, and identify issues for joint modeling activities and future areas of research.

The workshop featured eight expert sessions which saw discussions around the various aspects of setting up an India-centric energy modelling platform.

Discussions on energy modelling in India and the world explored how energy modelling can play an important role in decision-making. The panelists particularly laid focus on bridging the rural-urban divide and factoring in energy pressures from the informal economy within models. There was a need expressed to ensure that holistic perspective of energy consumption and ground realities must be inducted to produce practical and feasible energy models, converging land and water use patterns within energy models.

Deliberations included a spotlight on how the impact of the evolving character of India’s cities, industries and especially the transport sector should be included in the any India-centric models. The shift towards electric mobility, an increasing emphasis on mainstreaming of renewable energy options and overarching environmental concerns were also stated as key factors for determining India’s energy future.

The session featuring representatives of key central government ministries laid special emphasis on ensuring social, environmental and economic costs of energy production and consumption are accurately calculated to future-proof decision making and policy planning. The workshop included extensive discussions about the framework of an India Energy Modelling Forum and its institutional, coordination and funding mechanisms.

The workshop was attended by various Central Ministries and Agencies including Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, POSOCO, Bureau of Energy Efficiency, Central Electricity Authority and TIFAC; international organizations such as the European Commission, International Institute of Applied System Analysis, GIZ, DFID, EDF etc; leading Indian research institutions (CEEW, TERI, CSTEP, IRADe, PRAYAS, IIM Ahmedabad, NIT Bhopal etc.) and energy sector experts.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved:


	Setting up of a National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage, to drive clean, connected, shared, sustainable and holistic mobility initiatives; 
	Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) valid for 5 years till 2024 to support setting up of a few large-scale, export-competitive integrated batteries and cell-manufacturing Giga plants in India. 
	Creation of a PMP valid for 5 years till 2024 to localize production across the entire Electric Vehicles value chain. 


Both PMP schemes will be finalised by the National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage.

 

National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Storage:

Composition:


	The multi-disciplinary “National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage” with an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee will be chaired by CEO NITI Aayog. 


 


	The Steering Committee will be comprised of Secretaries from Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Power, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Department of Science and Technology, Department of Heavy Industry, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, and Director General, Bureau of Industrial Standards. 


Role:


	The Mission will recommend and drive the strategies for transformative mobility and Phased Manufacturing Programmes for EVs, EV Components and Batteries. 
	A Phased Manufacturing Program (PMP) will be launched to localize production across the entire EV value chain. The National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage will determine the contours of PMP, and will finalise the details of such a program. 
	The details of the value addition that can be achieved with each phase of localisation will be finalised by the Mission with a clear Make in India strategy for the electric vehicle components as well as battery.
	The Mission will coordinate with key stakeholders in Ministries/ Departments and the states to integrate various initiatives to transform mobility in India.

Impact:


	The Mission will drive mobility solutions that will bring in significant benefits to the industry, economy and country. 
	These solutions will help improve air quality in cities along with reducing India’s oil import dependence and enhance the uptake of renewable energy and storage solutions. 
	The Mission will lay down the strategy and roadmap which will enable India to leverage upon its size and scale to develop a competitive domestic manufacturing ecosystem for electric mobility. 
	The actions in this regard will benefit all citizens as the aim is to promote ‘Ease of Living’ and enhance the quality of life of our citizens and also provide employment opportunities through ‘Make-in-India’ across a range of skillsets. 


 

Background:

During the Global Mobility Summit held in September 2018, Prime Minister had outlined the vision for the future of mobility in India based on 7 C’s    which are Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-free, Charged, Clean   and Cutting-edge mobility. Mobility has the potential to drive the economy forward and positively impact the lives of citizens both in urban and rural areas. 

 

Affordable, accessible, inclusive and safe mobility solutions are primary strategic levers for rapid economic development and improving ‘Ease of Living’. Shared, connected and clean mobility solutions are increasingly becoming the key principles of effective mobility solutions across the world. Given its commitment to climate goals, India needs to adopt effective strategies to place itself as a key driver of the mobility revolution in the world. 

 

Hence, there was a need felt to establish a dedicated multi-disciplinary Mission that will facilitate cooperative federalism, extensive stakeholder and inter-ministerial consultations and implement end-to-end policy framework for transforming the mobility landscape with particular focus on: 

1.         Manufacturing

2.         Specification & standards

3.         Fiscal incentives

4.         Overall demand creation and projections

5.         Regulatory framework 

6.         Research & Development

 

These initiatives will pay significant dividends to a rapidly urbanising India in the decades to come.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved Continuation of Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), and for incurring expenditure up to Rs. 1000 crore till 2019-20 by Atal Innovation Mission for expanding Atal Tinkering Labs to 10,000 schools in view of their huge success at school level.

Details


	AIM has multiple programs to encourage and support innovation in the country. 
	State of the art Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs) are being established in thousands of schools, world class Atal Incubation Centres (AIC) and Atal Community Innovation Centers (ACIC) are being established for universities and industry, 
	Promotion of product development in areas of national relevance and social importance is being supported through Atal New India Challenges (ANICs).


Financial implications:


	Each ATL receives a grant in aid of Rs. 12 lakhs in the first year, and upto 2 lakhs per year for subsequent 4 years, for maintenance of the ATL equipment and operational expenses. 
	Each selected AIC would be receiving grant in aid upto Rs 10 crore over 3-5 years in tranches per year, based on review and evidence of planned milestones reached. 
	Innovators will receive commercialization and technology deployment grants upto Rs. 1 crore under the ANICs.


Impact:


	The Mission has undertaken many bold and forward-looking initiatives such as Alal Tinkering Labs (ATL) and Atal Incubation Centres (AIC), which have received great traction;
	Many Ministries/Departments of Government of India have initiated innovation related activities with the help and technical support of AIM.
	Under the ATL program, more than 10,000 schools are expected to establish these labs by 2020. 
	More than 100 Atal Incubation Centres (AICs) are likely to established around the country, supporting at least 50-60 startups each over the first five years. 
	More than 100 innovators/startups are expected to receive some support for productizing their innovations. 
	Other programs being supported through Ministries will have even more beneficiaries.
	Each incubator is expected to foster 50-60 technology driven innovative Startups every four years. 
	The 100+ Incubators set up would thus foster 5000-6000 innovative Startups and this will multiply with new incubators being set up. 
	The potential for employment generation from these innovations driven Startups is quite high.


Implementation Strategy and targets:

AIM selects each beneficiary through open, competitive, online applications, and disburses grants directly. Furthermore, AIM leverages its experts and networks around the country to build capacity in ATLs, AICs, etc. connecting various kinds of populations. Additionally, corporate and international partners are connected to AIM beneficiaries, to ensure flow of information and technology between academia, innovation, and the start-up ecosystem as well as provide mentoring support to ensure success of AIM's initiatives. Till date, 5441 Atal Tinkering Labs have been selected across the country, out of which 2171 ATLs  from  623   districts  have already  received the  first tranche of grant-in-aid  for establishment of the labs in their respective schools. 101 Atal Incubation Centres have been selected nationwide, out of which 31 have received the first tranche of grants.    

 Twenty-four Atal New India Challenges (ANIC) have been launched and more than 800 applications have been received. 2-3 winners per ANIC would be selected and receive a grant of upto Rs 1.0 crore in 3 tranches based on review and evidence of planned milestones achieved.

AIM's Mentor of Change Programme is mandated to ensure the success of the ATLs. Through this programme, well-qualified mentors from different professional backgrounds are selected to provide pro-bono mentoring to ATL students over a range of skills. Mentors also collaborate with the School administrators to ensure the ATLs operate in the manner, mandated by AIM. As on date, more than 2,500 mentors are actively mentoring students in over 1,300 ATL schools. 

Background:

AlM's objectives are to create and promote an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship across the country at school, university, research institutions, MSME and industry levels. The Mission has been set up under NITI Aayog, in accordance with the Hon'ble Finance Minister's declaration in the 2015 Budget Speech.

                Linking the Transformation of Aspirational Districts Programme with India’s pursuit of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the NITI Aayog organized a conference on implementation of SDGs in Aspirational Districts.

The valedictory session of the conference was addressed by Mr Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, and other technical sessions included participation from Ms Preeti Sudan, Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Mr Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, representatives of Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, State officials, Central Prabhari Officers and District Collectors/Magistrates.

The conference included deliberations on key SDGs and best practices to help achieve the same and will featured presentations by State representatives who have done well on the SDG India Index on key themes of health, education and water resources.

Mr Amitabh Kant also felicitated eighteen fast moving Aspirational Districts, on the basis of delta rankings calculated in November – December 2018 and December 2018 - January 2019 on basis of the Champions of Change dashboard.

These delta rankings reflect overall improvements made across sectors and sector specific ranks in the domains of Health & Nutrition, Agriculture & Water Resources, Education, Skill Development & Financial Inclusion and Basic Infrastructure.

The Aspirational Districts programme has evolved from the principle of ‘Convergence of Schemes’ to provision of additional financial resources to the Districts to undertake innovative projects that significantly improve the indicators.

Earlier this year, Department of Public Enterprises notified rules mandating 60% of CSR allocation of CPSEs under health, nutrition and education to be spent on projects in Aspirational Districts. Today, additional funding to the tune of about Rs 1,000 crores was announced for two years for projects under challenge method to be rewarded to top performing districts every month as per improvement made in the delta ranking.

Promoting the spirit of competitive and cooperative federalism, the districts will be supplied supplementary funding from the Government of India to focus on key projects in their districts. There will also be a team of experts housed in NITI Aayog, who will provide necessary technical assistance for preparing feasibility reports, monitoring and evaluation support to the projects to ensure transparent and targeted expenditure.

The funding allocation has been designed in a manner such that districts having mineral fund accrual annually of more than Rs. 30 crores do not receive this additional allocation but are encouraged to continue focusing on bettering governance structures and implementation efficiency. However, they were recognized for their performance by the NITI Aayog through a special commendation during the conference. States have also been requested to ensure that additional allocation of equivalent amount from DMF is made available to these districts.

To ensure fairness and parity of allocation, districts which receive funding under this scheme, will not be eligible for the same under any category in a calendar year. And in the interest of transparency and effective utilization of the funds, detailed guidelines will soon be notified.

Launched by the Hon’ble PM in January 2018, the ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ programme aims to quickly and effectively transform the most underserved 112 districts across India.  The broad contours of the programme are Convergence of Central & State Schemes, Collaboration of Central, State level ‘Prabhari’ Officers & District Collectors, and Competition among districts driven by a mass movement at the grassroots which realizes the aspirations of a New India.

                Chief Economic Adviser K.V. Subramanian said that if this century has to belong to India then innovation has to be at the forefront. Therefore, competition policy in the context of innovation becomes really critical. He said these in his keynote address at the 4th edition of national conference on ‘Economics of Competition Law’ organised by Competition Commission of India here today.

Shri Subramanian also advocated for deterrence as a tool to make defaulting companies fall in line with set guidelines and follow pro-market behaviour. Deterrence is crucial for encouraging pro-market behaviour, he said citing an example of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The fear of defaulting companies to be brought under the IBC compelled many of them to voluntarily approach the banks and pay up, he said. IBC has catalysed the recovery of around Rs 3 lakh crore from various default cases, directly or indirectly, since its inception in 2016.

Explaining the link between competition and innovation, the CEA said that in a perfectly competitive industry firms will only be able to price their products to the marginal costs. If they are pricing to marginal costs then there isn't enough profit to be made. In a perfectly competitive market price has to be equal to the marginal costs. If the industry is expected to be perfectly competitive then no firm in that industry will have enough incentive to invest in innovation because the returns are not adequate. He also said that the other extreme of monopoly also doesn’t lead to innovation. Shri Subramanian said the sweet spot for more innovation is actually a moderate level of competition. If there is extreme competition, you don't get innovation. The CEA said that perfect competition doesn't lead to more innovation. The higher the competitive pressure, the greater seems to be the innovation.

Pressing upon the need for competition policy to account for the specificities of the sector under consideration, Shri Subramanian said there are some sectors where perfect competition does not provide best outcomes. Competition policy, therefore, needs to be assessed sector by sector. The most important thing that the authorities need to be thinking about is the optimal industry structure for that particular sector.

Shri Subramanian also pointed out that product market competition needs to be complemented by competition in factor markets, viz. market for finance and market for research. Deep financial markets are critical for funding of new ideas. When new firms challenge incumbents, they innovate to avoid being “creatively destroyed”.

He pointed out that proportion of credit, though not the magnitude, flowing to smaller firms has shrunk over the last decade, which needs to be addressed through enabling regulatory framework. Effective competition in product markets and factor markets is important for fostering innovation in the Indian economy, he said, adding that this in turn will generate more jobs, encourage entrepreneurship and promote growth.

Referring to policy making, Shri Subramanian said policies should be such that it promote moderate level of competition for promoting innovation. He added that there are no incentives for promoting innovation in perfectly competitive market and even when the competition is low.

Shri Ashok Kumar Gupta, Chairperson, CCI, in Special Address, emphasised that the necessity for an enforcing authority to frame its guiding policy in a clear and transparent manner. The discipline of economics can help in providing the much needed clarity and transparency. Further, he emphasised that competition is an economic law and most modern competition law regimes have economic goals, such as promoting economic efficiency and consumer welfare. He also stressed on the fact that economic analysis have to help in building legally robust cases in CCI’s decisions as these are subject to further judicial review. It makes it important that the economic analysis used in cases is comprehensible and that it fits well into the legal framework. Shri Gupta also informed the audience that the commission has initiated a market study in the e-commerce sector to understand the evolving competition landscape. 

In her opening remarks earlier, Dr Sangeeta Verma, Member, CCI, emphasised that markets are changing rapidly and the application of the law also has to keep pace, especially in the wake of digital space, Big data, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, machine learning altering the market dynamics. She also pointed that this conference is an attempt to bring theory and practice closer, to reconcile legal principles to economic rationale and above all to have exchange of ideas.

The national conference, in addition to this inaugural session, had two technical sessions where researchers presented 6 papers on economics of competition law, a special session on contemporary anti-trust issues and a plenary on digital markets: anti-trust and beyond. The national conference was attended by policy makers and advocates besides global participants from Europe and America.
