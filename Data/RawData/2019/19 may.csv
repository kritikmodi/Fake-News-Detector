                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi felicitated the Indian contingent for the Commonwealth Games (CWG) 2022 in New Delhi. The felicitation was attended by both athletes and their coaches. Union Minister for Youth Affairs & Sports and Information & Broadcasting Shri Anurag Singh Thakur and Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Nisith Pramanik were among those present.

The Prime Minister congratulated the players and coaches for their stupendous performance at the Commonwealth Games 2022 held in Birmingham, where India bagged 22 Gold, 16 Silver and 23 Bronze medals in various disciplines. The Prime Minister welcomed the athletes and coaches and expressed immense pride in the accomplishments of India’s athletes at  CWG 2022. The PM said that it is a matter of pride that due to the splendid hard work of the sportspersons, the country is entering into the Azadi ka Amrit Kaal with an inspiring achievement.

The Prime Minister highlighted that in the last few weeks, the country has accomplished two major achievements in the field of sports. Along with the historic performance in the Commonwealth Games, the country has organized the Chess Olympiad for the first time. Addressing the athletes, the Prime Minister said “while all of you were competing in Birmingham, crores of Indians were keeping awake till late night here in India, watching your every action. Many people used to sleep with alarms set up so that they remained updated on the performances.” The Prime Minister said as per his promise at the time of the contingent’s send-off that we are celebrating victory today. 

Highlighting the great performance, the Prime Minister remarked that numbers do not reflect the entire story as many medals were missed by the narrowest possible margins which will soon be rectified by the determined players. He said that India has found a new way of winning in 4 new games as compared to last time. From lawn bowls to athletics, the athletes have performed phenomenally. With this performance, the trend of youth towards new sports in the country is going to increase a lot, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister also highlighted the achievements of the daughters of India in boxing, judo, wrestling and their domination in the CWG 2022. He said 31 medals came from the players who were making their debut indicating the growing confidence of the youth. 

The Prime Minister said that the athletes have strengthened the resolve of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshta Bharat’ not just by gifting a medal to the country, but also by giving the opportunity to celebrate and to be proud. The Prime Minister added the athletes inspire the youth of the country to do better not only in sports but also in other sectors. “You weave the country in unity of thought and goal that was also one the great strength of our freedom struggle”, he said. Mentioning the galaxy of freedom fighters, the Prime Minister said that despite the variance in methods, they all had the common goal of independence. Similarly, our players enter the arena for the prestige of the country. The Prime Minister mentioned that the power of the Tricolour was seen in Ukraine where it had become a protective shield not only for Indians but also for the citizens of other countries in getting out of the battlefield.

The Prime Minister expressed happiness upon the players who emerged out of the Khelo India stage and had done extremely well on the international stage. He also mentioned the positive effect of TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) which was now being seen. The Prime Minister highlighted the need to intensify our efforts to discover new talent and take them to the podium. “We have a responsibility to create a sports ecosystem that is globally excellent, inclusive, diverse and dynamic. No talent should be left behind”, he stressed. The Prime Minister also acknowledged the role of coaches, sports administrators and support staff in the success of the players. 

The Prime Minister urged the athletes to prepare well for the upcoming Asian Games and Olympics. On the occasion of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, the Prime Minister requested the athletes and their coaches to encourage children by visiting 75 schools, and educational institutions in the country, last year. The Prime Minister said that a lot of sportspersons had taken up this work and fulfilled it under the 'Meet the Champion' campaign. He also urged them to carry this campaign forward as the youth of the nation looks toward the athletes as role models. The Prime Minister said that “your growing recognition, capability and acceptance should be utilised for the younger generation of the country.” The Prime Minister concluded his address by congratulating the athletes on their ‘Vijay Yatra’ and wished them the very best for future endeavours. 

The facilitation by the Prime Minister is a part of his continuous endeavour to motivate athletes that represent India in major sporting events. Last year, the Prime Minister interacted with the Indian athletes’ contingent bound for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the Indian para-athletes’ contingent for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games. Even during the Commonwealth Games 2022, the Prime Minister took a keen interest in the athletes' progress and congratulated them on their success and sincere efforts, while motivating them to do better. 

The CWG 2022 was held in Birmingham from 28th July till 08th August 2022. A total of 215 athletes participated in 141 events across 19 sporting disciplines, where India bagged 22 Gold, 16 Silver and 23 Bronze medals in various disciplines.

On behalf of the entire country, he appreciated the efforts of the Election Commission, its officials and members of its staff, other public officials who were involved in management and superintendence of the campaign and polling, and police and security personnel, Central and state, for working tirelessly and diligently to uphold the sanctity of the people’s ballot and successfully completing a free and fair election. Above all, he commended hundreds of millions of voters who participated in the election process in such large numbers. This, the President noted, was entirely in keeping with our Constitution and India’s deep and unshakeable democratic traditions.

                Officer trainees of the Indian Foreign Service (2018 batch), as well as two officer trainees from the Royal Bhutan Foreign Service, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (May 14, 2019) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Addressing the officer trainees, the President said that India’s role and influence in the international arena is expanding. Geopolitics and geoeconomics are drawing Asia to the centre of global power relations. And in this matrix, India has an important role to play - as a driver of global growth and as an influential voice in global governance.

The President said the international community has greater appreciation of India and its global standing. Nations are looking to us for solutions to global challenges – be it climate change, cybersecurity, humanitarian disasters or combating extremism and terrorism. These open unprecedented opportunities but also pose new challenges for our diplomacy.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for empowering women through education and by implementing progressive measures like reservations in Parliament and State Legislatures.

Expressing his concern over instances of gender discrimination, Shri Naidu called for curbing it by bringing about attitudinal and behavioral changes in society.

Interacting with girl students from Carmel Convent School, Chanakyapuri, at his residence here today, the Vice President said that educating a girl was equivalent to educating an entire family, while educating a man was tantamount to educating an individual.

Shri Naidu stressed that education was not only for employment but for empowerment and enlightenment. The scheme, ‘Beti Padao, Beti Bachao’ was aimed at empowering the girl child, he added.

Shri Naidu said education must develop ideal and responsible citizens, who are socially conscientious with a national outlook. It was essential for youngsters to know about India’s cultural heritage, traditions, history, the role of national icons and freedom fighters as also the contributions of social reformers.

The Vice President said that garlanding the portrait of Bharat Mata alone was not nationalism. Placing the interests of the nation above everything else and taking care of fellow humans was nationalism, he added.

Shri Naidu also underscored the importance of probity in public life and observed that people should elect their representatives on the basis of 4 Cs—Character, Conduct, Capacity and Calibre and cautioned against the attempts to give importance to other 4 Cs—Cash, Caste, Community and Criminality.     

The Vice President said that the Indian economy was doing well and the country was being respected and recognized the world over. Many foreign companies were keen to invest in India.

Referring to the call given by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi to ‘Reform, Perform and Transform, he advised the young students to be part of the transformation to build a New India.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for renewed efforts by India to gain permanent membership of the UN Security Council.

Interacting with the Officer Trainees of the 2018 Batch of the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and Bhutanese Diplomats, here today, the Vice President referred to the growing prominence of India on the world stage and underscored the need for enhancing support from world nations and building a sustained dialogue in favor of UNSC reforms.

The Vice President also stressed the need to build a consensus for expansion and democratization of a number of multilateral fora to ensure representation to a number of other emerging nations.

Congratulating the young officers for choosing IFS as a profession, Shri Naidu said that the Service offered a challenging and exciting career and a unique opportunity to take India’s great civilizational and cultural ethos with its developmental aspirations to the rest of the world.

Terming the young diplomats as ‘future spokespersons, interpreters, and narrators of India’s story to the world’, the Vice President said that they would soon work on constructing new bridges of understanding between India and the rest of the world. ‘You can play an important role in shaping the geopolitics of the future and in determining the new world order’, he told them. 

Shri Naidu cautioned that the return of the unwelcome tendency of protectionism would adversely impact the global effort for collective advancement. Despite the acknowledged need for an Integrated World Order, new walls are being to the free flow of goods and services and people as well, he added.

Outlining the challenges the budding diplomats would have to deal with, Shri Naidu expressed his concern over the threat posed by terrorism. Observing that no country was immune to the consequences of terrorism, he called for a united response from world nations to curb the menace of terrorism.

Pointing out that India consistently took an unrelenting and uncompromising stand against terrorism, he said, “we must continue to be champions of peace”.

Referring to the unethical acts of financial fugitives, the Vice President expressed his concern over the ease with which they find safe havens in other countries. He suggested the constant updating and overhauling of Extradition Treaties and all bilateral and multilateral agreements to defend and safeguard the integrated global economic order for the collective good.

The Vice President said that the world community would need India’s participation to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, because of the problems faced by the planet today needed a humane and holistic vision. The world needs India because it needs a voice that speaks of peace, non-violence and peaceful co-existence.

Expressing his happiness that India took the lead in building sustainable development solutions, he said the International Solar Alliance launched under India’s initiative in Paris was such an example.

Stating that India was moving on the development path swiftly, Shri Naidu said that the world was looking at India with keen interest. He emphasized the need to take advantage of this momentum by capitalizing on opportunities in areas of trade, services, investments, and infrastructure. “Diplomats must be proactive in enabling Indian industries and business to tap into world markets and must do their best in encouraging foreign investment to flow into India”, he stressed.

Describing the Indian Diaspora as an asset, he said they play an important role culturally as well as economically in the countries they live in.

The Vice President urged the young officers to develop a deep understanding of the countries of their posting and explore all opportunities for improving relations between those countries and India. He advised them to uphold the principles of Integrity, Probity, and conscientiousness at all times. He asked them to be India’s articulate voices, proactive catalysts of India’s prosperity and relentless advocates of Indian values of peaceful coexistence, inclusive and sustainable development.

Referring to the recently concluded General Elections 2019, the Vice President said that people had made their choice with resounding clarity and had voted for stability.

The Secretary to the Vice President of India, Dr. I.V. Subba Rao, the Dean, Foreign Services Institute (FSI), Shri J.S. Mukul, the Joint Secretary, FSI, Shri Virendra Paul, the Course Coordinator, Shri. Amarnath Dube and others were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I welcome each and every one of you to Upa Rashtrapathi Bhawan.

Let me take this opportunity to congratulate all of you for choosing the Indian Foreign Service as a profession. The Foreign Service offers you the privilege of being India’s ambassador’s to the world. 

The Service offers a challenging and exciting career and a truly unique opportunity to take our country’s great civilizational and cultural ethos with its developmental aspirations to the rest of the world.

My dear young friends, 

You will soon be given the crucial responsibility of being all the spokespersons, interpreters and narrators of India’s story to the world.

You will construct new bridges of understanding, appreciation and collective advancement between India and the rest of the world and build new, forward looking and stable partnerships between nations. 

You can play an important role in shaping the geopolitics of the future and in determining the new world order.  

We are now living in a world that is more connected than ever before. The world is truly a ‘Global Village’. It is also swiftly changing in many unprecedented ways.

The changing global geo-political and geo-economic landscape requires a new agile, carefully strategized diplomatic response.

I see a number of challenges that budding diplomats such as yourself would have to deal with and overcome.

Despite the acknowledged need for an Integrated World Order, new ‘walls’ are being erected to the free flow of goods and services and people as well. 

This return of the unwelcome tendency of protectionism has the potential to adversely impact the global effort for collective advancement.

Let me impress upon you the grave nature of the threat that the world community as a whole faces due to terrorism. No country in the world is immune to the consequences of terrorism now and therefore curbing this menace would require a united response from world nations.

India has consistently taken an unrelenting and uncompromising stand against terrorism, we must continue to be champions of peace.

We are now confronted by the unethical acts of financial fugitives. 

The ease with which they find safe havens in other countries escaping the long arm of law is a serious global concern. Extradition Treaties and all bilateral and multilateral agreements need to be constantly updated and overhauled to defend and safeguard the integrated global economic order for collective good. 

My dear young friends, 

To transform this world into the world we want, in consonance with the United Nations’ transformative, ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world needs India. The world needs India not only because we are home to nearly 1.3 billion people comprising one- sixth of humanity. The world needs India because the problems and challenges facing the planet today need a humane, holistic vision. 

The world needs India because it needs a voice that speaks of peace, non-violence and peaceful coexistence. The world needs India because it needs to harness the potential of dialogue and discussion, collaboration and cooperation. 

This vision and voice, this attitude and belief are what India has stood for over the last twenty millennia. This vision and voice of India is more relevant to the world than ever before. 

Our core civilizational principle of viewing the world as ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ and our prayer of ‘Sarve Jana Sukhino Bhavanthu’ gives us the moral strength and courage to influence global discourse in these testing times of great turbulence.

I am glad to note that India has taken the lead in building sustainable development solutions.

International Solar Energy Alliance, launched under India's initiative at the COP 21 in Paris is one such example. 

You must continually look for opportunities to provide similar leadership and lead the global agenda setting and implementation in as many fields as possible.

Our foreign policy formulation and implementation must be firmly tied to the domestic development agenda. 

There is a constant need for a sustained dialogue and exchange of information between India’s representatives abroad and those who are implementing the development initiatives back home.  

With India moving on the development path swiftly, the world is looking at India with keen interest. We must not hesitate to take advantage of this momentum by capitalizing opportunities in areas of trade, services, investments and infrastructure. Diplomats must be proactive in enabling Indian industries and business to tap into world markets and must do their best in encouraging foreign investment to flow into India.

Just recently, we have conducted the ‘largest festival of democracy’. We have conducted the elections in a peaceful and orderly manner. The people have made their choice with a resounding clarity and voted for stability.

“I hope that all people will continue to deepen the roots of our rich democratic tradition and focus our collective energies on development, reforms and enhancement of the quality of our people’s lives”.

Indian Diaspora is a great strength of our nation. 

Diplomats must continually engage with Diaspora while also safe-guarding their interests and looking after their welfare and ensuring that their efforts and goodwill is appreciated and channelized suitably.

Just like the world needs India, India needs the world too. We need to learn and draw benefits from the good practices from all over the world. 

India is strong and is gaining in strength because we are open to good ideas from all over the globe.

This is what the ancient sages had also said when they said: “Aa no bhadrah kratavo yantu vishwathaha” “Let noble thoughts come to us from all over the world”. 

As you become consummate practitioners of the art of negotiations with other countries, I would urge you to put every single one of your decisions through two tests. Ask yourself if your decision will advance world peace and prosperity and if it protects our national interests.

During the last five years, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has significantly and remarkably raised the visibility and standing of India. 

India has emerged as the fastest growing economy with global powers acknowledging India’s growth story. 

We must renew our efforts to gain a permanent membership of the UN Security Council by further enhancing support from world nations and building a sustained dialogue in favor of UNSC reforms. 

We have to build consensus for the expansion and democratization of a number of other multilateral fora to ensure representation of a number of other emerging nations.

My dear young friends, 

As future designers of India’s foreign relations, you have to continually work on improving your knowledge and skills. 

You should cultivate deep interest in understanding the countries of posting and explore all opportunities for improving relations between those countries and India. 

You have to uphold the principles of Integrity, Probity and conscientiousness.

You must not only be India’s articulate voices but also be proactive catalysts of India’s prosperity and relentless advocates of Indian values of peaceful coexistence and inclusive, sustainable development.

I wish you all the very best in your careers.

Thank You! Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for achieving sustainable development that is equitable and people-centred and stressed the need for efficient and frugal use of natural resources.

Inaugurating the International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB) celebrations, in Chennai today, the Vice President said Biodiversity is fundamental to the survival of the human race and said that man must re-establish the link with nature, as did the ancients in India centuries ago, and take from earth and the environment only so much “as we can replenish”.

Observing that sustainable development mandates the efficient and frugal use of available natural resources including biodiversity, the Vice President said “a grave challenge we face today is the destruction of forests and the loss of species”.

Expressing his concern over the loss of trees at an unbelievable pace due to deforestation, urbanization, industrialization, and pollution, Shri Naidu said India’s forest cover stands at 21% against global standard of 33.3%. India has lost over 1.6 million hectare of tree cover between 2001 and 2018, according to a new study released by the World Resources Institute (WRI), Shri Naidu added.

Lamenting that the symbiotic relationship of man with nature was being threatened as societies develop, the Vice President warned that any damage to environment would put the well-being of future generations in peril. He also pointed out that the current consumption patterns especially in the industrialized world are unsustainable as they put enormous pressure on natural resources. 

The Vice President also spoke of the need to secure international cooperation in fields ranging from sustainable agriculture and food security to health and sustainable development to urban resilience and adaptation, to climate change and disaster risk reduction.

Stating that India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, Shri Naidu said that the concern for environment was an innate aspect of the Indian psyche and faith, reflected in religious practices, folklore, art and culture permeating every aspect of the daily lives of the people. 

The Vice President also pointed out that India had a long cultural tradition of frugality and simple living in harmony with nature and that all great religions which have traversed in our country have preached the unity of humankind with nature. He also stressed the need for inclusive growth and achieving home-grown food security, while ensuring sustainable development.

Shri Naidu commended the convention for rightly acknowledging that poverty eradication is the first and over-riding priority for developing countries and said that while giving practical shape and content to any internationally agreed architecture, care must be taken to allow each country to develop according to its own national needs, priorities and circumstances, while ensuring the harmonization of development with conservation.

Earlier in the day, the Vice President flagged off the ‘Tree Ambulance’ initiative, a campaign to save trees. The Tree Ambulance has been conceived, designed, fabricated and equipped to provide first aid treatment to trees, aid tree plantation, assist the shifting of trees, carry out seed ball distribution etc. 

Shri Naidu said that out of the box solutions such as the Tree Ambulance, coupled with community participation, can go a long way in conserving and increasing our green cover and applauded Shri K. Abdul Ghani and Shri Suresh for their efforts in setting up the Tree Ambulance.

The Vice President opined that the theme for this year’s IDB Celebrations, ‘Our Biodiversity, Our Food, Our Health’ was very topical. He emphasized that the Indian way of life dictated eating seasonal and locally available food. He said that our traditional food systems were healthier and much more balanced from the nutrition point of view. ‘Millet-based meals consumed extensively in rural areas all over India are extremely nutrient rich’, he added. 

Shri Naidu expressed deep concern regarding the homogenization of food habits and increased dependence on a handful of crops, resulting in a rapid decline of agro-biodiversity. ‘As much as 80% of food supply is based on a few crops such as rice, wheat, maize and millets. The loss of diversity in diets is directly linked to life-style diseases as well’, he warned.

The Additional Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri A.K. Jain, the Additional Chief Secretary, Govt. of Tamil Nadu, Shri Hans Raj Verma, the Principal Secretary, Govt. of Tamil Nadu, Shri Shambhu Kallolikar, the Secretary, National Biodiversity Authority, Dr. Purvaja Ramachandran and other dignitaries were present at the occasion. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It is indeed an honor and privilege for me to address you on this important occasion, as we celebrate the International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB).

The United Nations proclaimed May 22nd as the International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB) to improve understanding of issues related to biodiversity and raise awareness regarding the importance of conserving biodiversity, among the world community. 

It falls within the scope of the visionary Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and seeks international cooperation in fields ranging from sustainable agriculture and food security to water and sanitation, to health and sustainable development, to urban resilience and adaptation, to climate change and disaster risk reduction.

Most of nature’s contributions to people are not fully replaceable, and some are completely irreplaceable. 

Nature plays a critical role in providing food and feed, energy, medicines and genetic resources and a variety of materials fundamental for people’s physical and mental well-being and for maintaining culture. 

This day serves as a reminder of the critical role played by biodiversity in sustaining life on this planet and in promoting inclusive and sustainable development and of the need to conserve and foster biodiversity to the best of our ability. 

Dear Sisters and brothers,

As you know, India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, spanning a period of more than 4000 years. It has witnessed the fusion of several customs and traditions, which are reflective of the kaleidoscopic variety and richness of its cultural heritage. 

From a country reeling under the perils of colonialism, to one of the leading economies of the world within a relatively short span of 70 years, we have indeed come a long way.

The concern for environment is not new to our country. Ashoka, the great Indian emperor, was the first monarch, who, nearly 22 centuries ago, banned sacrifices, sport hunting and burning of forests. He also established through a royal proclamation, what is perhaps the first, formally established, state protected area for mammals, birds and fish. 

An insignia belonging to Ashoka’s empire is today the National Emblem of India, which has four lions symbolizing power, courage, pride and confidence, resting on a circular abacus with a lotus in full bloom, exemplifying the fountainhead of life and creative inspiration.

Historically, conservation of nature and natural resources was an innate aspect of the Indian psyche and faith, reflected in religious practices, folklore, art and culture permeating every aspect of the daily lives of the people. 

India also has a long cultural tradition of frugality and simple living in harmony with nature. The conservation ethos is deeply ingrained in our people. 

All great religions which have traversed in our country have preached the unity of humankind with nature. Indian heritage thus is unique in its reverence for Mother Nature in all her manifestations. 

Unfortunately, the symbiotic relationship of man with nature gets debilitated as societies develop. And, any damage to environment risks the well-being of future generations to come.

In post-independent India, a sweeping package of measures was brought about inter alia through the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the Forest Conservation Act in 1980. 

Local self governance got a major boost through the Panchayati Raj Amendment Act of 1992 that provided for devolution of powers and responsibilities to local elected bodies or panchayats for planning economic development.

To address environmental concerns at the global level, a plethora of multilateral environmental treaties have been negotiated, including the Convention on Biological Diversity.

Biodiversity is fundamental to the survival of the human race. 

Considering the dependence of all life on this earth on the goods and ecosystem services provided by biodiversity, this Convention merits a central place in global environmental discourse, a place that it rightfully deserves, more than 25 years after its birth at the Earth Summit at Rio de Janerio in 1992.

In response to the changing paradigms relating to biodiversity, post-Rio de Janerio, India enacted the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 to give effect to the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity. 

The recognition of Forests Rights Act, 2006 thereafter, gave forest rights to traditional forest dwellers whose rights on ancestral lands were not adequately recognized in colonial period.

Today inclusive growth and a rapid increase in per capita income levels are our development imperatives as one of the fastest growing economies of the world.

The Convention on Biological Diversity had rightly acknowledged that poverty eradication is the first and over-riding priority for developing countries.  

Hence, when giving practical shape and content to any internationally agreed architecture, care must be taken so as to allow each country to develop according to its own national needs, priorities and circumstances, while ensuring the harmonization of development with conservation.

Sustainable development mandates the efficient use of available natural resources including biodiversity. We therefore have to be much more frugal in the way we use these resources. 

The current consumption patterns especially in the industrialized world are unsustainable as they put enormous pressure on natural resources. 

Moreover, the poor who live at the subsistence level and are most directly and immediately dependent on goods and ecosystem services provided by biodiversity, would suffer first and most severely from such unsustainable models of living.

My dear sisters and brothers, 

A grave challenge we face today is the destruction of forests and the loss of species.

Forests are an important component of our ecosystem and render vital services which have a direct impact on the very sustenance of life on earth. 

Because of deforestation, urbanization, industrialization, and pollution, we are losing Trees at an unbelievable pace. The frequent natural disasters like cyclones, floods has washed out and damaged a lot of trees and affected lives of many. 

Our forest cover stands at 21% against global standard of 33.3%. India has lost over 1.6 million hectare of tree cover between 2001 and 2018, according to a new study released by the World Resources Institute (WRI).

I recently inaugurated a truly innovative and unique ‘Tree Ambulance’ and ‘Tree Spade’ initiative, a campaign to save trees. The Tree Ambulance is conceived, designed, fabricated and equipped to provide first aid treatment to trees, aid tree plantation, assist the shifting of trees, carry out seed ball distribution and facilitate awareness drives in favour of tree conservation and afforestation. 

Unconventional solutions such as the tree ambulance coupled with community participation can go a long way in conserving and increasing our green cover. 

The ‘Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ released by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biological Diversity and Ecosystem Services  (IPBES) on 6 May 2019 has underlined that global trends on continuing biodiversity collapse remain alarming due to unsustainable consumption in pursuit of a material-intensive lifestyle.

The report also finds that around 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades, more than ever before in human history. 
The average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900. More than 40% of amphibian species, almost 33% of reef-forming corals and more than a third of all marine mammals are threatened. 

In this context, I feel that the theme of International Day for Biological Diversity this year ‘Our Biodiversity, Our Food, Our Health’ is very topical.

This year’s celebrations focus on biodiversity as the very foundation for our food and health and a key catalyst to transforming food systems and improving human health. 

The theme also celebrates the diversity provided by our natural systems for human existence and well-being on Earth, while contributing to other Sustainable Development Goals, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, ecosystems restoration, cleaner water and zero hunger, among others.  

Over the past several decades, while we have acquired the capability to produce large quantities of food and have become quite self-sufficient, we have simultaneously increased our dependence on just a handful of crops.

Globally also, in the last 100 years, more than 90 percent of crop varieties have disappeared from farmers’ fields, affecting the food security of billions of people across the globe.

As much as 80% of food supply is based on a few crops such as rice, wheat, maize and millets. The loss of diversity in diets is directly linked to life-style diseases as well.

Half of the breeds of domestic animals have been lost and over fishing has had its adverse impact on aquatic resources as well. 

With these unsustainable practices, there has been a rapid decline of agro-biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge related to food and medicine.  

Agriculture, diets and nutrition have changed dramatically in recent decades. 

The increase in consumption of processed and commercial food items overtime, results in a decrease in the quality of diet. 

This unwelcome tendency of homogenization of diets also makes us vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change, pollution and other developmental imperatives, putting food and nutrition security at risk.

The Indian way of life has been to eat seasonal, locally available food, a principle that is also endorsed by the traditional Indian systems of medicine.  

The practice also decreases ecological footprint by reducing the energy requirements in processing, packaging, storing and transportation of food which is non-local and non-seasonal.

In our country, the traditional food systems evolved over centuries have proven to be healthier and more balanced from the nutrition point of view. 

Millet-based meals consumed extensively in rural areas all over India are extremely nutrient rich. 

By   securing the life-sustaining goods and services which biodiversity provides to us, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity can provide significant benefits to our health and well-being. 

In contrast, the continuing loss of biodiversity on a global scale represents a direct threat human existence itself.

Good health and well-being is also one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals propounded by UN and adopted universally.

The conservation of biodiversity is central to achieving this and many other Sustainable Development Goals.

At a more basic level, I believe that modern man must re-establish the link with nature, as did the ancients in India centuries ago, and take from Earth and the environment only so much as we can replenish. The wise sages of ancient India, though the Atharva Veda, chanted this hymn to Earth, I quote:            

‘What of thee I dig out, let that quickly grow over; 

Let me not hit thy vitals, or thy heart’.

Let us together be responsive to the changing needs of the world to achieve sustainable development that is equitable and people-centred.

Let us collectively take this pledge today: 

""Mother Earth, you have been, taking care of us, so far, now, the time has come, for us to take care of you"".

 

Thank You, Jai Hind.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India has emerged as an attractive destination for global investors and asked educational institutions to maintain high standards and foster academic excellence. He was addressing the Convocation of Great Lakes Institute of Management, in Chennai today.

Observing that India was poised to become a US $ 5 trillion economy in the next few years, Shri Naidu said there was a need to remove economic imbalances, urban-rural divide, end gender and social discrimination and enhance the prestige of all the institutions, including the Supreme Court, CAG, CVC, EC, Parliament and State Legislatures. He said that nobody should say or do anything to undermine the sanctity of these institutions. There are appropriate forums to redress grievances, if any, he added.

The Vice President said that India is the largest Parliamentary democracy in the world and has a track record of effective electoral system and conducting elections on a regular basis. Describing elections as ‘Festival of Democracy”, he complimented the Election Commission for conducting the stupendous exercise in a peaceful and orderly manner.

Asking the graduating students to respect their alma mater and always act to enhance its reputation, Shri Naidu advised them to focus on achieving academic excellence and become socially conscientious citizens. He said that the atmosphere on university campuses should not be vitiated by extraneous issues and added that he was happy that barring a few, most of the 900 Universities were free from any disturbance.

The Vice President also told them not to neglect their parents, mother tongue, native place, motherland and Guru (teacher). He further said that they should also strive to promote and protect the safety and security of the motherland. “Taking care of fellow human beings is nationalism and not merely saying Vande Mataram or Jai Hind”, he added. He also emphasized the need for the education system to inculcate ethical and moral values among the students.

Observing that management was not confined to the corporate sector alone, Shri Naidu said that the scope of management studies should cover the rural economy, agriculture and allied industry and provide solutions to make these sectors viable and vibrant.

Stating that agriculture was in distress, the Vice President said that there was a need to introduce structural changes and come out with new strategies and programmes to make agriculture profitable and sustainable. Complimenting the Great Lakes Institute for making students to interact with villagers under Karma Yoga programme, he said it was important for them to know and understand the rural problems.

Shri Naidu also stressed the need for Indian management institutions to adopt globally accepted teaching practices, methodologies and curriculum to ensure that our students are duly recognized in the global job market. Indian institutions have to adopt globally accepted benchmarks to achieve global prominence and align with other management institutions. “Such academic alliances with institutions of international repute, are a great way to provide learning experience to students”, he added.

The Vice President told the youngsters that they were joining India’s growth story at a very exciting juncture. Today India is one of the world’s fastest growing economies and has become the second largest global hub for Start Ups, he added.

Pointing out that the 4th industrial revolution was driven by rapidly changing technology, Shri Naidu told the graduating students that as managers they will be required to manage technology driven changes in industrial processes and practices.“Every change is potentially disruptive. You have to control and manage this disruption. So equip yourself with knowledge and upgrade your skills continuously”, the Vice President added.

Shri Naidu said today’s millennial population was ambitious and adventurous. They seek out challenges and they experiment with disruptive ideas and innovations, he said. “Sustaining this culture of innovation and enterprise in a fast changing technological environment is a challenge for management education. Up-skilling, re-skilling, learning and adopting the best practices are key elements for individual growth”, he added.

The Vice President drive home his message, he quoted from Thirukkural: “Learn thoroughly all that is to be learnt. And what is even more important is to live true to that learning”.

Referring to the impressive academic achievements of brilliant young students in their Class 12 exams, the Vice President said “as we rejoice their achievements, it is our onerous responsibility to provide them with best and affordable higher education of global standards which will provide them opportunities to enter the global job market”.

Eminent Scientist and former Director General of CSIR, Dr. Ramesh Mashelkar, Dr. Vaidyanathan Jayaraman, Principal and Associate Dean, Great Lakes Institute of Management, senior faculty members and parents/ guardians of the graduating students were present at the event.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has lamented the neglect of the indigenous Ongole cattle breed and called for protecting and promoting the animal, which has become popular all over the world.

Releasing a Compendium on Ongole breed of cattle at the Swarna Bharat Trust in Vijayawada today, the Vice President asserted that cattle wealth was national wealth and pointed out that Brazil which has imported these cattle and produced hybrid Ongoles was earning huge revenue through export.

‘Unfortunately, India is not focusing enough attention on our own breed”, he added. 

Shri Naidu said the time has come for promoting Ongole cattle breed in a big way and also take up research on the animal, which is known for its toughness, high milk yield, tolerance to tropical heat and disease resistance.

The 1200-page Compendium traces the history of the animal from 1885 to 2016 by providing information from 13 books and 80 research findings on Ongole Cattle.

Lauding the efforts of Agricultural scientist, Mullapudi Narendranath and former Joint Director, of Animal Husbandry Department, Adusumilli Madhusudan Rao for compilation of the Compendium, he felicitated them. 

The Vice President also wanted the officials to expedite the works at National Kamadhenu Breeding Centre, Chintaladevi in Nellore District, which was set up when Shri Naidu was the Union Minister.

Observing that agriculture was facing many challenges, the Vice President stressed the need for multi-pronged efforts from all stakeholders to double the income of farmers by making agriculture sustainable and profitable. He urged farmers to take up backyard poultry and in house dairy for fetching additional income.

He also expressed his anguish over the degeneration of values, principles and tolerance levels and lack of discipline in present-day politics and warned that it would be harmful to democracy unless the situation was remedied.

The Vice President also inaugurated a medical camp organized jointly by Aayush Hospitals, Rainbow Hospitals and Shankara Netralaya in the premises of Swarna Bharat Trust and cautioned people against the growing incidence of non-communicable diseases due to life style changes. 

Underlining the importance of maintaining proper lifestyle by undertaking regular physical exercise, yoga and consuming healthy diet, he warned that eating instant food would lead to constant diseases. 

Touched by a news item describing the manner in which a disabled girl, Saisree overcame her handicap and scored a good rank in SSC exams, Shri Naidu invited her parents and the girl to the Swarna Bharat Trust and presented a cheque for Rs.50,000, which comprises Rs,25,000 from his salary and another Rs. 25,000 donated by his son, Shri Harshavardhan on behalf of Muppavarapu Foundation run by his family members and promised her parents further help if they continue to support her with her studies.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has expressed his anguish over the low quality of political debates during the just-concluded election campaign with politicians resorting to personalized attacks instead of focusing on larger issues of public concern.

Speaking at a function organized to felicitate the Vice President by his friends and well wishers following the recent conferment of Honorary Doctorate by the University for Peace at Costa Rica, he said that politicians should remember that they are only rivals and not enemies and said that the language should not be abusive. All political parties, people and the press too should seriously ponder over this issue, he added.

Shri Naidu recalled that during his younger days as a legislator, he used to be highly critical and harsh of the policies of the government but never indulged in personal attacks. He underlined the importance of respecting the institutions of the Prime Minister, Chief Minister, Leader of Opposition and other public representatives.

The Vice President expressed his anguish over the falling standards in every walk of life. He appealed to all, including legislators, political parties, institutions and people in public life, to uphold high standards and values. He also urged the people to select and elect their representatives on the basis of Character, Calibre, Conduct and Capacity to strengthen democracy, although four other Cs—caste, cash, community and criminality are trying to be predominant.

Shri Naidu also took dig at the growing trend of defections and freebies offered by political parties. He also advised the media not to mix views with news and said that there should be an audit of the performance of the public representatives every five years. The country and the states need able leaders and a stable government, he added.

Referring to his interactions with foreign dignitaries in India and during his visits abroad, he said the world was impressed with India’s economic momentum. “India is being recognized and respected the world over”, he asserted and pointed out that the Indian economy was moving forward while the global economy was slowing down.

Shri Naidu said that India was respected by the rest of the world for its age-old ethos and civilizational values and for always upholding the principles of peace and non-violence.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for increasing the acreage and productivity of pulses for achieving self-sufficiency and urged agricultural universities to step up research on improving their yields.

Speaking at the Inaugural session of All India Coordinated Research Group’s Annual Group Meet on MULLaRP & Arid Legumes workshop, at Guntur, Andhra Pradesh today, the Vice President said there was a need to introduce high-yielding, disease and pest-resilient seed varieties. There was also a need to improve crop production techniques and bring additional fallow lands under pulses production, he added.

Pointing out that pulses were an inexpensive source of plant-based proteins, vitamins and minerals for people, Shri Naidu said they provide green, nutritious fodder for animal and also  enrich soil through biological nitrogen fixation. “Some legumes are known to have medicinal and therapeutic properties also. Hence, they were rightly termed as 'Unique Jewels' of Indian crop husbandry"", he added. 

Observing that legumes were an essential component in Indian cropping pattern, especially in dry land farming, Shri Naidu said India was the world’s largest producer, accounting for 34% of the area and 24% of production followed by Myanmar, Canada, China, Nigeria, Brazil and Australia.

Referring to his recent visit to Vietnam, the Vice President mentioned about crop production differentials between India and Vietnam. He said that Vietnam produces 5 tons of rice per hectare and 1.5-tonne soya bean per hectare, while India was producing only 3 tons of rice per hectare and only one ton of soya bean. 

While the average productivity of pulses has increased to 841 kg/ ha, it is well below the global average and in some States, the yield is much higher as compared to others, the Vice President said. There was a need to learn from the best practices from around the world and within the country to improve crop productivity, he added.

Shri Naidu said that the Universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and the government must come together with long term strategies for producing new high yielding varieties, which are resilient to diseases and climate change. There was also a need to create value addition and proper marketing facilities for pulses.

Saying that climate change was adversely impacting the marginalized people in dry land areas due to the shifts in moisture and temperature regimes, the Vice President called for a new paradigm in agricultural research that makes full use of science and technology in conjunction with traditional knowledge to cope with the challenges of climate change and achieve food and nutritional security was necessary.

Shri Naidu said that the water shortage was becoming a serious problem and that it was getting compounded due to population growth and climate change. He called for developing crops that use less water. 

Observing that there was an urgent need for new knowledge, alternative policies and institutional changes to improve productivity from agricultural crops, the Vice President advised agricultural universities, research institutions and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) to play a big role in improving  the lot of the farmers and empowering them.

“Agricultural Universities need to focus more on improving the yields of pulses, while KVKs should act as a bridge between scientists, governments, and the farmers” Shri Naidu said. The KVK should act as friend and guide of the farmer, he added.

Underscoring the important role of pulses in promoting a healthy diet, Shri Naidu cautioned the people, particularly the youth against eating junk food in the wake of growing incidence non-communicable diseases.

The three-day event was jointly organized by Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). The DDG(CS), ICAR, Dr. A.K. Singh, the Vice Chancellor of ANGRAU, Dr. V. Damodara Naidu, the Director, ICAR-Indian Institute of Pulses Research, Kanpur, Dr. N.P. Singh, the Director of Research of ANGRAU, Dr. N V Naidu and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am pleased to participate in the inaugural session of All India Coordinated Research Group’s Annual Group Meet on MULLaRP & Arid Legumes workshop.

As you all are aware, legumes harvested for dry grains are classified as pulses which are critical and inexpensive source of plant based proteins, vitamins and minerals for people around the globe in general and particularly in India where majority people are vegetarians.

Pulses historically have been one of the most important constituent of the Indian cropping and consumption patterns. Pulse crops form a unique feature of our farming system, particularly in dry land agriculture. They provide food for human consumption, green nutritious fodder for animal and enrich soil through biological nitrogen fixation. 

Legumes are not only a rich source of protein but also cheaper when compared to animal proteins. In addition, pulses are an important source for some of the essential amino acids and have been reported to reduce the levels of cholesterol and blood glucose. 

Some legumes are known to have medicinal and therapeutic properties also. Hence, they were rightly termed as “Unique Jewels” of Indian crop husbandry. Globally, different pulses are cultivated in 83.3 million hectares in 171 countries with the production of 81.8 million tonnes. India is the world’s largest producer, accounting for 34% of area and 24% of production. Myanmar is the second largest producer, followed by Canada, China, Nigeria, Brazil, and Australia.

India is the largest producer, consumer, processor and also the importer. About 90% of the global pigeon pea, 75% of chickpea and 37% of lentil area falls in India. The major pulses producing states are Madhya Pradesh,  Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. 

The global production of pulses doubled from 40.8 million tonnes in 1961, to 81.8 million tonnes in 2016. The increase in yield was about 55.8% compared to cereals where the yield tripled during the same period. The low increase in yield of pulses compared to cereals shows that there is significant potential to improve the productivity in pulses. 

The total consumption of various pulses and pulse products in India is about 21-22 million tonnes. India’s annual pulse production is about 18.45 million covering an area of about 23.47 million hectares-- majority of which falls under rainfed, resource poor and harsh environments frequently prone to drought and other abiotic stress conditions. 

To meet the demand of pulses, India is at present importing about 4.02 million tons from different countries, including the USA and Russia. In order to ensure self-sufficiency, the pulse requirement in the country is projected to be 32 million tonnes by 2030. However, import of pulses declined from 100 lakh tonnes in 2016-17 to 56.5 lakh tonnes in 2017-18, resulting in saving of foreign exchange amounting to Rs 9,775 crores.

Dear sisters and brothers, I had recently visited Vietnam to further strengthen bilateral ties between India and Vietnam and to participate in the 16th UN Day of Vesak Celebrations. However, what is relevant to be mentioned here is the crop productivity differentials between India and Vietnam. 

The average productivity of rice cultivation in India is around 3 tonnes per hectare, which is below the average productivity in Vietnam of around 5 tonnes per hectare and far below peak farm productivity in select farms in Vietnam at around 7-8 tonnes per hectare.  Productivity in countries such as Egypt is at 7.7 tonnes per hectare.

Similarly, the productivity of soya bean cultivation in India is around one tonne per hectare as against around 1.5 tonnes per hectare in Vietnam.  

I have mentioned these figures to underscore the need for agricultural universities to step up research on improving productivity of various crops and also to produce new, climate resilient high-yielding varieties. 

Why is it important to grow pulses? 

According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), pulses are essential crops for a number of reasons. They are packed with nutrients and have high protein content, making them an ideal source of protein particularly in regions where meat and dairy are not physically or economically accessible. 

With the problems of malnutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies affecting sections of our population, pulses can play a significant role in promoting healthy diet. They are low in fat and rich in complex carbohydrates, micro-nutrients, proteins and B vitamins.

As such, pulses are recommended because they lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Pulses have also been shown to help combat obesity.

Apart from improving soil fertility due to their nitrogen-fixing property, they also contribute towards climate change mitigation by reducing dependence on synthetic fertilizers. Greenhouse gases are released during the manufacturing and application of these fertilizers.

While pulses production has increased in the past few years, there is a need to increase the acreage as well as productivity to achieve self-sufficiency in the coming years. Although, the average productivity has increased to 841 kg/ ha, it is well below the global average. In some States, the yield is much higher as compared to others. There is a need to learn from the best practices from around the world and within the country and adopt them for improving productivity.

With pulses playing a pivotal role in promoting national food security, we need to introduce better seed varieties that are high-yielding, disease and pest-resilient, improve crop production techniques and bring additional fallow lands under pulses production. There is also a need to ensure adequate MSP to the farmers.

This is where agricultural universities, research institutions and Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) can play a big role in improving the lot of the farmers and empowering them. Agriculture Universities need to focus more on improving the yields of pulses, while KVKs should act as a bridge between scientists, governments, and farmers. 

A study published by the National Institute of Labour Economics Research and Development in 2015 said that “With the intervention by KVKs, about 80 percent of the farmers have modified their agricultural patterns which were related to the diversification of crops and changes in cropping pattern, seed planting technique, use of fertilizers and pesticides, changes in machinery used and in water use pattern. More than 50 percent of the farmers have mechanized their farm operations; however, ownership of farm machinery and technology adoption increased with the size of holdings and education level of the farmers,”

The KVKs are important grass root level institutions to empower the farming community and also for transforming the lives of the rural population. 

As you all are aware, India’s major food crops-- rice and wheat--have been heavily incentivized with MSP and given preferential PDS treatment to benefit the Indian poor. Hence, Indian farmers are motivated to grow either these crops or cash crops like cotton and sugarcane. Pulses have been a second choice for the farmers for cultivation. 

I am told that pulses cultivation is also receiving attention of the Indian farmers due awareness about newer soil management techniques such as crop rotation and inter cropping. 

In an effort to make pulses more remunerative and accessible to the consumers, Minimum Support Price (MSP) for all major pulses was introduced which allows imports at zero duty and bans exports. Yet the per capita availability and the consumer prices remain low and high respectively.

Dear sisters and brothers, greater attention has to be paid to harvest the huge potential of summer pulses in Indo-Gangetic plains and rice fallows. Summer pulses are being grown as a bonus crop in the states like Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. 

I am told that progress has been made in the last few years to develop short duration varieties of pulses in different Agricultural universities. More intense efforts are needed to develop suitable pulse technology for rice fallow to expand the base of pulses production in eastern states like Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. 

As you all are aware, water scarcity is increasing day-by-day and the problem is getting compounded due to population growth, climate change and variability. Crops that use less water should become part of the strategy to increase food production. There is a need to promote arid legumes which have the inherent capacity to be resilient and withstand climate change. Also, the legume basket has to be expanded by adding minor grain legumes. This will also act as a buffer when major grain legumes are not successful due to drought.

In order to increase adoption of arid legumes, improved varieties that are drought and heat-stress tolerant, nutrient dense and high yielding should be made available. About 80% - 90% of arid legume seed systems are farmer-driven-- either from other farmers or from informal local market. Hence, aspects of their breeding, seed systems, production, marketing and utilization should be addressed immediately for crop and nutritional security in arid and semi-arid tracts of our country. 

There is a need for new knowledge, alternative policies and institutional changes to improve productivity from agricultural crops. The marginalized people in dry areas are likely to be more seriously hit by the shifts in moisture and temperature regimes as a result of climate change. Hence, there is a need for a new paradigm in agricultural research that makes full use of science and technology in conjunction with traditional knowledge to cope with the challenges of climate change and achieve food and nutritional security.

JAI HIND!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that nuclear electricity could significantly reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions and has the potential to meet increasing energy demand in the country.

Addressing Scientists and the Staff of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), in Hyderabad today, on the occasion of 70 years of exploration and research by the organization, he pointed out that climate change was one of the foremost environmental concerns today.

Stating that the need of the hour was to ensure that modern technologies were safer and reliable, the Vice President observed that nuclear power was one of the reliable and safe energy options and commended India’s record of operating our nuclear fleet for over 40 years without any serious incident.

Shri Naidu said India’s abiding interest in nuclear energy grew out of a deep conviction that the power of atom could be harnessed to help the country to achieve human and societal development. He said that India has consciously made a strategic choice to pursue a low-carbon growth model in the coming decades and added that reducing pollution was a major challenge.

Appreciating the efforts of AMD in adopting state-of-the-art exploration techniques in search of different strategic minerals, the Vice President said it was heartening to know about the availability of more than 3 lakh tonnes of uranium oxide reserves and around 1200 million tonnes of Beach sand Mineral resources in our country. “More significantly, the quantum leap in Uranium resource augmentation by AMD from around 1 lakh tonnes during first 60 years of activities and a subsequent addition of around 2 lakh tonnes in the next 10 years is really commendable”, he added.

Shri Naidu also expressed confidence that exploration efforts of AMD in different parts of the country, including Cuddapah Basin would lead to more uranium mines.

With several favourable geological domains spread across length and breadth of the country which can host potential Uranium, Rare Metals and REE deposits, the Vice President said it would be possible to achieve self-sufficiency in atomic mineral resources for sustainable growth of our Nuclear Power Programme. Considering the steep demand for power in the country, the role of nuclear energy in future would be quite significant. “We need to develop new and more efficient technologies to utilise our resources to the maximum”, he added.  

The Director of AMD, Mr. M.B. Verma and other senior scientists and officials were present on the occasion.

Earlier, the AMD officials made presentation on the activities of the organization to the Vice President.

The Vice President also unveiled a plaque on ‘Cuddapah Monolith’ to commemorate 70 years of exploration and research by AMD.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

 

""I am delighted to be amongst the fraternity of Department of Atomic Energy here in the office complex of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), Hyderabad on the occasion of celebration to commemorate 70 glorious years of Exploration and Research activities.

As you all are aware, India’s abiding interest in nuclear energy grew out of a deep conviction that the power of atom can be harnessed to help the country to achieve human and societal development. India has consciously made a strategic choice to pursue a low-carbon growth model in the coming decades.

Following the vision and foresight of Dr.Homi J. Bhabha, Department of Atomic Energy has reached great heights since its inception and has taken giant leaps to attain self-reliance and self-sufficiency in atomic mineral resources for the country’s nuclear power programme. Considering the steep demand for power in the country, role of nuclear energy in future would be quite significant and we need to develop new and more efficient technologies to utilise our resources to the maximum.

 

Dear sisters and brothers,

Geo-resources are nature's gift bestowed upon a nation. The prosperity of a nation greatly depends on proper utilisation and exploitation of such resources. Human civilization has gone through various stages and has entered the Nuclear Age. During every stage of civilisation, exploitation of geo-resources has played a key role for its survival. New exploitation mechanisms have evolved with the transformation of civilisation. Minerals are vital raw materials for many basic industries and are major components for growth and industrial development. The management of mineral resources, hence, has to be closely integrated with the overall strategy for development of infrastructure to meet the national goals.

In India, AMD is the sole entity of Government of India, involved in exploration and augmentation of Atomic Mineral resources such as Uranium, Thorium, Niobium, Tantalum, Lithium, Beryllium and Rare Earth Elements.

I am aware that its activities are closely linked to different phases of nuclear fuel cycle of our country. In the front end of the fuel cycle, AMD shoulders the responsibility of survey and exploration for identification of atomic mineral deposits. I am told that it has also been entrusted with the responsibility of site selection for nuclear reactors. It is also supporting the DAE in choosing suitable geological repository sites for long-term disposal of radioactive waste in the back-end of fuel cycle.

I appreciate the efforts of AMD in adopting state of art exploration techniques in search of different strategic minerals. I am told that the exploration is being carried out by aerial and ground surveys and through subsurface drilling to augment the resources. I commend the dedicated efforts of geoscientists in carrying out surveys and exploration in remotest and inaccessible parts of the country.

Despite some challenges and constraints, the success story of team AMD is exemplary.  It is heartening to know about the availability of more than 3 lakh tonnes of uranium oxide reserves and around 1200 million tonnes of Beach sand Mineral resources in our country. More significantly, the quantum leap in Uranium resource augmentation by AMD from around 1 lakh tonnes during first 60 years of activities and a subsequent addition of around 2 lakh tonnes in the next 10 years is really commendable.

AMD is also actively involved in facilitating exploitation of mineral resources by conducting exploratory mining. I am told that the stepped up exploration efforts in the environs of Cuddapah basin which is spread over both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Bhima basin in Karnataka and in other parts of the country are encouraging. I am sure that these dedicated efforts will lead to more uranium mines.

I am also informed that to cater to the needs of the Rare Metals (RM) in Nuclear Power Programme of India and to meet the growing requirement of Rare Earth Elements,  AMD is carrying out exploitation of Rare Metals (RM) like Niobium, Tantalum, Lithium and beryllium and exploration for rare earth resources, based on indigenous technology and expertise.

Governed by their application in nuclear sciences, space research, defence, medical sciences, high tech industries and clean energy generation, there is steep rise in the global demand for Rare Metals and REE. Owing to their strategic nature, the rare metals are categorised among the prescribed substances under Atomic Energy Act, 1962.

I am told that China controls more than 95% of world’s supply of Rare Earth oxides. India is also involved in exploration of REE in parts of Siwana Ring Complex in Rajasthan and at Ambadongar in Gujarat. I am sure that huge beach sand mineral resources, potential hard rock, inland Rare Metal and REE resources are likely to contribute in the indigenous growth of Indian industries under the aegis of “Make in India”.

 

Dear sisters and brothers,

India is endowed with several favourable geological domains spread across length and breadth of the country which can host potential Uranium, Rare Metals and REE deposits. With advancements and modernization of exploration techniques, it would be possible to achieve self-sufficiency in atomic mineral resources for sustainable growth of our Nuclear Power Programme.

Further, the contribution of this department in other aspects of societal benefit is really praiseworthy. I guess not many people in the country are aware of the work that all of you do for using nuclear technology in the areas of healthcare, food and agriculture, water resources management and environmental protection.

The need of the hour is to ensure that modern technologies are safer and reliable. I am happy to note that considerable attention is being paid to make modern technologies safer.

Today, nuclear power is one of the reliable and safe energy options. It is considered to be safe, environmental friendly, sustainable, reliable and efficient source of electrical energy.  I am glad that we have a commendable record of operating our nuclear fleet for over 40 years without any serious incident. I am sure that more safety features would be added with constant technological advancements.

Please note that climate change is one of the foremost environmental concerns today.  Nuclear electricity is generated through very low carbon emitting technologies and can significantly reduce emission of Green House Gases. It has the potential to meet the ever-increasing demands of energy in the country, especially at time when we as a nation are making attempts to move beyond the polluting fossil fuels.

I am told that AMD regularly conducts public outreach programmes on its achievements as also to address the concerns of the people regarding nuclear energy, especially on possible environmental impact.

The main objective of every scientific achievement should be to improve the lives of the people by addressing the challenges the mankind is facing on different fronts.

To conclude, I would like to mention that while your achievements are commendable, there is no room for complacency. Nation building is a long-term and never-ending process and we have lot of challenges to overcome. In the  70th  year  of  Exploration and Research activities of AMD, which  also  coincides  with  150th  birth  anniversary  of  the  father  of  the  nation “Mahatma  Gandhi”,  I wish all success to AMD as well as DAE  in achieving their goals.

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon social science researchers to come up with innovative and out-of-box solutions to address various problems confronting the world from eradicating poverty to achieving sustainable development.

Speaking at the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), here today, the Vice President said the objective of every research outcome should be to better the lives of the people. The upliftment of the poor should be the goal of social science research. As such, any research would be incomplete if the researcher failed to spend time in the field and with the people.

Urging social science researchers to find solutions to societal problems, the Vice President he stressed the need for inclusive development, reaching the unreached and funding the unfunded. Achieving sustainable developmental goals, taking care of the health of the population, alleviating poverty, mitigating the urban-rural divide and the challenges faced by the agriculture require a fresh and practical approach, he added.

Stating that tight boundaries between various disciplines have almost disappeared, the Vice President said that today’s researchers cannot confine themselves to compartmentalized silos and must have a basic understanding of other related disciplines. For example, health, education and environment cannot be confined to particular disciplines, he added.

Referring to the emerging areas in bio-technology, genetic engineering, biodiversity, new materials, micro-machines and others, Shri Naidu said social science research should strengthen the data base of policy makers and provide them with evidence-based inputs for policy improvement and implementation.

The Vice President also advised social scientists to think of new areas of research which are of crucial concern to us as a nation while keeping in mind our collective concern for rest of the world.

Observing that the world has been changing at a very fast pace in the wake of globalization, Shri Naidu said that the degree of mutual dependence was also growing and no country could today think of living in an isolated manner. Liberalization, privatization and globalization brought forth many opportunities and challenges as well, he added.

The Chairman of ICSSR, Dr. B.B. Kumar, the Member Secretary of ICSSR, Prof. V.K. Malhotra, academics and social sciences researchers were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am delighted to participate in the Golden Jubilee Programme of the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR). Completion of 50 years for any organization is a major landmark, particularly so for ICSSR, which is dealing with complex issues like social, economic and human development.

Established on 12th May, 1969 to encourage, promote and fund social science research in the country, ICSSR has emerged as a premier organization and is contributing actively towards the development of the country and the society through social science research. My compliments to the organization, social scientists and other key functionaries associated with it.

I am aware that with the aim of broad-basing social science research, ICSSR has established six regional centres and funds 24 research Institutes and five recognized research institutes located in different parts of the country.

Dear sisters and brothers, as you all are aware, rapid changes are taking place all over the world and in India on technological and other fronts. The process of economic liberalization and globalization of economies which began in early 1990s has completely changed the international scenario of bilateral and multi-lateral relations among countries. In order to find out acceptable solutions to issues of prime importance to the society and economy of the country, there is well-appreciated need to see them through the perspective of social science.

I am told that till the end of sixth five-year plan (the mid 1980s), a large number of projects sanctioned by the Council were of an empirical nature evaluating Government programmes and policies that were being implemented at local and regional levels. Policy research of relevance cannot merely focus on the evaluation of Government programmes in the regional or local dimensions. With the change in socio-economic and socio-political environment worldwide, I am glad that ICSSR has attuned its programmes and activities to sharply focus on contemporary issues.

I am glad to note that ICSSR has sanctioned about 6250 projects and 471 research programmes during last 50 years. It has the distinction of awarding 6015 Doctoral fellowships, 2081 Post-doctoral fellowships and other fellowships to various categories of scholars engaged in social science research.

I am also informed that one of the prime concerns of ICSSR has been to promote young researchers and university teachers by awarding doctoral fellowships and post-doctoral fellowships.

As you all are aware, international collaborations have proved to be a major determinant of quality of research and such collaborative efforts enhance the impact of research and lead to joint projects, high quality joint publications, more citations and exchange of scholars.

I am told that the Indo-Dutch Programme on Alternatives of Development (IDPAD) has been one of the best examples of such initiatives taken by ICSSR, under which a number of publications were also brought out. I am told that during last 50 years there have been exchanges of 985 scholars under the programme.

I am glad to know that ICSSR has entered into bilateral memoranda with the reputed research councils in different countries.

With research institutions like the ICSSR providing valuable research inputs to policymakers, it is important for social science researchers to focus on societal problems and find solutions so that the entire society stands to benefit from such endeavors.

Development and its aims are now to achieve inclusivity. Reaching the unreached, funding the unfunded are the new norms across the globe. Achieving sustainable developmental goals, taking care of the health of the population, alleviating poverty, mitigating the urban rural divide and the challenges faced by the agriculture and those depend on it require a fresh, practical approach. Researchers should come up with out of box and innovative solutions to address the pressing problems confronting the world at large.

A large number of problems, initiatives and trends need the attention of researchers. Some of these may include trends in Indian federalism, India’s position at the global stage, foreign policy and the policy with neighbors, urban transformation, rural transformation, smart city initiative, sustainability of resources, greening cities, the process and implications of migration, security issues, cyber security, our intellectual tradition, skills and employment, technology for development and transformation, governance and e-governance, inclusiveness of development, make in India, public-private partnership in a society like India, food security, agrarian problems, environmental problems, clean India, health care and its delivery, access, equity and quality in education, knowledge and innovation ecosystem and improvement in the quality of all possible institutions.

Critical research in these areas would certainly provide new insights to the policy makers and the government.

Albert Einstein had said: “The significant problems we face today, cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at, when we created them”.

The challenges of today and the emerging challenges of tomorrow need creativity, design-thinking and a solution-seeking mind set and competence.

The solutions should lead to a more inclusive, sustainable world.

As I mentioned earlier, the world is changing at a very fast pace since the process of globalization began in 1980s and 1990s. The degree of mutual dependence is also growing and no country can today think of living in an isolated manner. In this mutually dependant world, everyone realizes the importance of learning from each other’s experience and adopting global best practices. This is all the more important in research. Any research that is subjected to international rigor, methodology and evidence is bound to be better in quality and impact.

I must compliment ICSSR for its efforts in having one of the best collaborative arrangements in the country as the institution entered into MoUs with the most renowned institutions of the world.  Such collaborations gave exposure to Indian social scientists and also provided tremendous visibility to the social science researchers with potentials.

As Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar had said, “An idea needs propagation as much as a plant needs watering.  Otherwise, both will wither and die”.  I am therefore glad that the Institute is nurturing talent and fostering excellence with a clear focus on social equity and gender sensitivity.

Dear sisters and brothers, unlike in the past, tight boundaries between various disciplines have almost disappeared. Today’s researchers cannot confine themselves to compartmentalized silos and must have a basic understanding of other related disciplines. The issues are also no longer discipline-specific and cut across several disciplines. A holistic research approach needs to be adopted in an inter-disciplinary manner.

For example, health, education and environment are of immense concern to all and cannot be confined to particular disciplines.

The canvas of new research both in science and social science is vast and will definitely help young researchers to get a wider perspective on various phenomena. The emerging areas in bio-technology, genetic engineering, biodiversity, new materials, micro-machines, bio-medical simulations and equipment, new dominions in space research and technology including permanent human habitat in space, and similar new frontiers in oceans, are some of the examples.

It is against this background that the role of social scientists needs to come out clearly. No one can enter knowledge society successfully without being armed with the knowledge of social science. If natural science is compared to a computer, the software is the social science.

The social science research should strengthen the data base or information base of policy makers and should provide them with evidence-based inputs for policy improvement and implementation. The interface with the policy makers is expected to enrich both the researchers and policy makers to understand the intricacies of issues and provide realistic solutions.

I am glad that ICSSR has been undertaking national level studies on the topics like women empowerment, national integration, educational status of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and status of minorities etc. The launch of IMPRESS (Impactful Policy Research in Social Science) by MHRD in October 2018 is certainly a great milestone for ICSSR which has been assigned its implementation as there would be about 1500 research projects.

This scheme is set to attract the best talent in social sciences for high quality research output on crucial contemporary social science issues having policy significance.

I think the time has come for social scientists to consolidate on the gains, critically evaluate the work done so far and move forward.  We need to think of new areas of research which are of crucial concern to us as a nation while keeping in mind our collective concern for rest of the world. Can we open new frontiers of research?

On the completion of 50 years of ICSSR, the above issues need to be addressed in the Indian perspective and accelerate the momentum created by ICSSR for promotion of social science research for the larger benefit of society and nation as a whole.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for an enlightened global leadership to ensure a conflict free world order based on peace and sustainable development and asserted that Buddhism promotes such transformation. He asserted that adhering to the core principles of Buddhism can liberate individual minds and provide the much desired positive leadership that can rescue the troubled humanity besides addressing a just and responsive world order.

Shri Naidu elaborated on the virtues of Buddhism and it’s relevance to the present times while delivering the keynote address at the 16th United Nations Day of Vesak, at Tam Chuc Pagoda in Ha Nam province of Vietnam today, on the invitation of his Vietnamese counterpart. He spoke on the theme “Buddhist Approach to Global Leadership and Shared Responsibilities for Sustainable Societies”. The Prime Minister of Vietnam, Mr. Nguven Xuan Phuc, the President of National Vietnam Buddhist Sangha and the President of UN Day of Vesak Celebration 2019, Dr. Thic Thien Nhon and over 1600 leading Buddhist from several countries were among the participants.

‘Vesak’ marks the birth, enlightenment and the Parinirvana of Lord Buddha whose teaching have caught the imagination of people across the world over the last 2,500 years.

Shri Naidu said “Buddhist approach of righteous behavior, wisdom, compassion and camaraderie and reduction of Trishna (greed) offers a set of building blocks for the architecture of a new world order where violence and conflict are minimized and development takes place without degrading the natural resources. He referred to transformation from Ashoka-the-Fierce to Ashoka-the-Righteous after the Kalinga War inspired by Buddha’s teachings.

The Vice President stressed that avoiding extreme positions and adopting a ‘middle  path’ as taught by Buddha leads to realizing the truth which leads to avoiding conflict, reconciliation of different view points and achieving consensus. ‘’This steers individuals away from bigotry, dogmatism and fanaticism to a more balanced view of life essential for peaceful co-existence and Buddhism is an antidote to the contemporary malaise of radicalization and religious fundamentalism’’ Shri Naidu stressed.

Noting that the genesis of conflict has roots in the idea of hate violence originating from an individual’s mind-space, Shri Naidu said that the growing menace of terrorism is a manifestation of this destructive emotion. “The proponents of ideologies of hate need to be constructively engaged to avoid mindless death and destruction and there is no higher bliss than peace as stated by Buddha’’ Shri Naidu said.

Referring to the contemporary challenges being faced by the global leadership, Shri Naidu said that peace and sustainable development are interlinked and they feed on each other. He urged the world leaders to work together to promote dialogue, harmony and justice based on compassion and wisdom. Sustainable society is possible only through sustainable consumption and production given the limited natural resources.

The Vice President observed that throughout human history the dark forces of unbridled ambition and unending spiral of irrational hatred and anger have raised their ugly head and unfolded a number of tragic tales of blood and tears and visionaries like Buddha showed the path to restore sanity to troubled humanity. He said that India’s vision has been of a world as one large family and it’s dreams have been woven around the theme of peaceful co-existence.

​The President of Myanmar, Mr. Win Myint, the Prime Minister of Nepal, Shri K.P. Sharma Oli, the Most Venerable Supreem Patriarch of National Vietnam Buddhist Sanga, the President of the National Assembly of Vietnam, Ms. Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, the Chairman of the National Council of Bhutan, Mr. Tashi Dorji and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                On the penultimate day of his four-day official visit to Vietnam, the Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu continued his high-level engagement by holding talks with Vietnam’s Prime Minister, Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc on a wide range of issues and underscored the importance of strengthening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two nations to ensure peace and security in the region.

The Vice President, who is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the 16th UN Day of Vesak Celebrations on May 12, reiterated during his talks with the Prime Minister that cordial and friendly relations between India and Vietnam have been strengthened by bonds of Buddhism and Hinduism.

Referring to the growing cooperation between two nations in different fields, Shri Naidu informed the host Prime Minister that India was ready to partner with Vietnam in satellite construction, both for civilian and non-civilian uses. He also assured him that India remains committed to extend cooperation in training and capacity building of Vietnam's defence forces as that country’s requirement.

On bilateral trade, the Vice President expressed confidence of achieving the target of USD 15 billion by 2020.

Observing that Indian companies were increasingly looking to invest in emerging sectors like renewable energy and energy conservation, infrastructure, agriculture, agro-products, textiles, pharma and oil and gas, Shri Naidu informed him of India’s commitment to address various issues relating to market access and trade barriers.

Seeking Vietnam Prime Minister’s personal intervention in facilitating the entry of Indian pharmaceutical products into their country, the Vice President assured him that the Indian companies can provide high tech health systems and medicines for public health in Vietnam at an affordable cost. This will make health services more affordable and reduce the insurance burden on the Government of Vietnam, he added.

Regarding oil and gas exploration in Vietnam, Shri Naidu sought an extension of up to 10 years for OVL (ONGC Videsh Limited) contract, which is due to expire in 2023. He said that OVL has invested more than USD 530.00 million in exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in Vietnam and was exploring possibility of another gas discovery that may entail additional investment of around USD 136.00 million. He also wanted extension of Production Sharing Contract by Petro Vietnam by two years.

The Vice President also reiterated India’s support to Vietnam for the non-permanent membership of the UNSC for 2020-21 and thanked Vietnam for its support to India to be a permanent member of an expanded UNSC.

Shri Naidu said that India has strong interest in Indo-Pacific region. India’s approach and vision to Indo-Pacific is SAGAR – Security and Growth for All in the Region.

Earlier, inaugurating a ‘Jaipur Foot Artificial Limb Fitment Camp’ held at the Indian Embassy under ‘India for Humanity’ programme to mark the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Vice President said the core philosophy of India from time immemorial has been to share and care and emphasized the need to pay attention to the deprived sections. 

Stating that the iconic Jaipur Foot provided mobility, a sense of dignity and an ability to live life fully to the differently abled, Shri Naidu lauded Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti, for providing the services free of charge.

Earlier in the morning, the Vice President visited Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and paid homage to the Vietnamese Revolutionary Leader, Ho Chi Minh.

The Vice President also attended a Gala Dinner Reception hosted by the Chairperson of the National Assembly of Vietnam, Ms. Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan at the National Convention Centre.

                The Vice President of India, Shri  M. Venkaiah Naidu emphasized the importance of building a peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region on the basis of respect for national sovereignty and international law and expressed the hope that the concerned countries would be able to reach a consensus on Code of Conduct in South China Sea.

On the second day of his four-day official visit to Vietnam, Shri Naidu held wide-ranging high-level talks with top Vietnamese leadership, including the Vice President, Ms. Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh and Chairperson of the National Assembly of Vietnam, Ms. Nguyen Kim Thi Ngan and attended a Banquet Lunch hosted in his honour.

Shri Naidu said that his talks with Vice President, Ms. Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh, this morning, were extensive and productive. “Our discussions covered the whole range of bilateral and multilateral cooperation”, he added.

In a joint press statement issued along with Vietnam’s Vice President, Ms. Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh, Shri Naidu said that both India and Vietnam were fully committed to an open, transparent, inclusive and rules-based regional architecture based on freedom of navigation and over flight, unimpeded economic activities and peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the international law.

During his talks with the Vietnamese leadership, the Vice President expressed confidence that the interactions would provide a new direction, momentum and substance to the bilateral cooperation between the two countries. He told them that the exchange of high level visits from both the sides was a clear indication of the commitment of both the countries to further strengthen Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. India’s commitment to be a reliable development partner was stronger than before, he added.

Describing Vietnam as a “strategic pillar of India’s Act East Policy and our key interlocutor in ASEAN”, the Vice President said India’s commitment to be a reliable development partner was stronger than before. He said that both the countries agreed to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in defence and security, outer space, science and technology, oil and gas, renewable energy, infrastructure development, agriculture and innovation-based sectors.  

Stating that the bilateral defence and security cooperation between the two countries was robust, Shri Naidu said India was providing extensive training support to Vietnamese Armed Forces and the implementation of the Line of Credit of US Dollars 100 million for building high speed patrol vessels for Vietnamese Border Guards was progressing satisfactorily.

Referring to bilateral trade, which stood at nearly US Dollars 14 billion last year having nearly doubled from US Dollars 7.8 billion three years ago, the Vice President expressed confidence of achieving bilateral trade target of US Dollars 15 billion by 2020. 

Calling for relaxing trade barriers and facilitating free trade between the two countries, he said the huge potential for expanding bilateral trade and should be fully realized. 

Shri Naidu also said that he was looking forward for direct air connectivity between our two countries with the Indian civil aviation carrier Indigo planning to start direct flights between India and Vietnam later this year. This step would go a long way in boosting bilateral trade and tourism exchanges.

The Vice President assured that India would continue the long-term and short duration scholarships and training programmes provided under ITEC programme and by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. These programmes have been most effectively used in the agriculture sector, making a tangible difference in the lives of the Vietnamese people.

The Vice President also extended an invitation to his Vietnamese counterpart, Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh, who accepted the same.

Shri Naidu was also appreciative of the Vietnamese cuisine and the traditional Vietnamese music played during the Banquet Lunch.

Earlier, the Vice President visited the Monument of National Heroes and Martyrs and paid tributes.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu kicked off his four-day official visit to Vietnam by addressing the Indian community soon after his arrival at Hanoi today.

 

Describing the ties between India and Vietnam as civilizational and historic, the Vice President said “our partnership has stood the test of time. More than 2000 years ago, Indian monks and traders brought with them the message of peace and compassion of Lord Buddha to Vietnam”. 

 

Shri Naidu said that successive generations of leaders from Ho Chi Minh and Mahatma Gandhi to the current leaders have built upon this trust and goodwill.

 

Referring to the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries, Shri Naidu stated that India is committed to building its cooperative relationship with Vietnam in diverse fields.

 

Pointing out that agricultural growth has been a key driver in the remarkable progress achieved by Vietnam, he said India was privileged as a development partner to have contributed to Vietnam’s agricultural revolution and food security. 

The Vice President said the Indian community in Vietnam, though small in number, has numerous achievements to its credit and was well respected. Indians and Indian business and industry in Vietnam have been instrumental in promoting bilateral understanding and creating opportunities for the local economy and society. 

Expressing his satisfaction over the doubling of the trade between the two nations from US Dollars 7.8 billion in 2016 to nearly US Dollars14 billion last year, he said both the nations must come together with pride and purpose and help each other grow and prosper. 

Referring to India’s growth story, the Vice President said that an ambitious and transformative vision was making India one of the most favorite investment destinations in the world. India has become the fastest growing large economy in the world. “We will be a USD 5 trillion economy by 2030”, he added and gave a detailed overview of the progress achieved in various sectors.

Observing that India was moving fast to transform itself into a modern 21st century inclusive economy, Shri Naidu said three D`s--Democracy, Demand and Demographic Dividend were scripting India`s story and termed the Indian Diaspora as the fourth D. He urged the Indian Diaspora to contribute and join in the development agenda back home.

Describing Indians living abroad as our cultural ambassadors, he told them continue to cherish their Indian roots and rich cultural traditions and at the same time nourish the socio-economic and cultural life of Vietnam.

The Vice President said that he was looking forward to his official engagements with the Vice President, Mr. Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh, the Prime Minister, Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Chairperson, National Assembly of Vietnam, Ms. Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan during his visit. 

On May 12, the Vice President will participate in the 16th United Nations Day of Vesak at Tam Chuc Pagoda in Vietnam's northern Ha Nam province and deliver the keynote address at the inaugural of the event.

The Secretary to the Vice President of India, Dr. I.V. Subba Rao, the Secretary (East), Ministry of External Affairs, Smt. Vijay Thakur Singh, the Ambassador of India to Vietnam, Shri P. Harish and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It gives me immense pleasure to be visiting Vietnam, on my first trip to this beautiful land as the Vice President of India. 

The progress and development undertaken by the country is impressive. This is an important year for us as we celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the celebrated visit of the Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore to Saigon in 1929. That visit started the intense re-engagement of India with Asia in the modern era and raised the profile of each country in the public consciousness of the other.

The relationship between India and Vietnam is civilisational and historic and our partnership has stood the test of time. More than 2000 years ago, Indian monks and traders brought with them the message of peace and compassion of Lord Buddha to Vietnam. 

Our successive generations of leaders starting from Ho Chi Minh and Mahatma Gandhi to the current leaders have built upon this trust and goodwill. I am proud to be a part of this rich tradition.

I am honoured and humbled to participate in the 16th UN Day of Vesak celebrations in Ha Nam Province representing India, the land of Buddha, where I would be delivering the key note address.

I look forward to my official engagements with Vice President Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh, Prime Minister, Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Chairperson, National Assembly of Vietnam, Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan in this visit. Such regular interactions at the highest levels between our countries have brought about a greater understanding and synergy in our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.

I am happy to inform you that Jaipur Foot Artificial Limb Fitment Camp was successfully conducted in two Vietnamese provinces last year which benefitted hundreds of Vietnamese citizens. 

Under the ‘India for Humanity’ program of the Government of India to commemorate 150th Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we are conducting Jaipur Foot Artificial Limb Fitment Camps. I would visit the camp on Saturday  and interact with some of the beneficiaries.

India has been a steady and strong developmental partner of Vietnam. Over the years, Vietnam has been successful in making huge socio-economic advances. Sustained high levels of economic growth, combined with vision and foresight of its leadership, has ensured rapid progress, development and prosperity. 

Agricultural growth has been a key driver of this remarkable feat. As a development partner, we feel privileged to have contributed to Vietnam’s agricultural revolution and food security. Under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, India is committed to continue its development assistance to Vietnam. 

India is currently offering more than 130 scholarships under the ITEC programme and around 48 scholarships for higher studies in India provided by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.

A dedicated Archaeological Survey of India team has been working in Vietnam for the past 3 years for the conservation and restoration of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of MySon in Vietnam. We also look forward to expanding our development partnership assistance to the Cham community in the Ninh Thuan province through the implementation of our grants-in-aid projects.

This year, our country celebrates the biggest festival of democracy in the world. We are currently conducting the General Elections where more than 900 million registered voters, of whom over 15 million electors are first time voters in the age group of 18-19 years, would be participating. I would encourage my fellow citizens to be a part of these celebrations and participate whole heartedly in the elections back home.

Though small in number, the Indian community in Vietnam has numerous achievements to its credit and is well respected in the society. Indians and Indian business and industry in Vietnam have been instrumental in promoting bilateral understanding and creating opportunities for the local economy and society. 

It is a matter of satisfaction that our trade has nearly doubled from US Dollars 7.8 billion in 2016 to nearly US Dollars14 billion. 

Yoga has been a great binding force and is hugely popular in Vietnam. Vietnamese people have welcomed Indian culture, Indian television serials and enjoyed cultural immersion experiences provided by the Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre in Hanoi.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has complimented students from Karnataka, here today, for learning Sanskrit and trekking up to 12,000 feet on Himalayas and hoisting the Sanskrit Flag as part of ‘Sahyadri to Himadri’ expedition.

As many as 46 students, including girls from Vasavi Primary and High School at Shivamogga called on the Vice President to share their experiences. The expedition was organized by Samskrita Bharati, a non-profit organisation working to revive Sanskrit.

Addressing the students and expedition team, who belonged to different age brackets from 11 years to 64 years, the Vice President wanted everybody to learn mother tongue and other languages including Sanskrit. He said Sanskrit is known as the mother of all languages and pointed out that scholars in western countries are doing research on Vedas, Upanishads and Sanskrit literature.

The Vice President emphasized the importance of Sanskrit as the invaluable window to Indian cultural treasure house as well as the origin of most Indian languages. He wished that students should be encouraged to learn this language to understand the depth and richness of Indian heritage. “We shouldn’t neglect Sanskrit, Governments and Educational institutes should provide an opportunity to learn Sanskrit”, he added.

Addressing students who have successfully completed a trekking expedition ‘Sahyadri to Himadri’ organized by Samskrita Bharati, Shri Naidu said that expeditions such as the one undertaken by them not only exposes them to different people, languages, cultures, and traditions but also inculcates the feeling of oneness and helps in national integration.

Shri Naidu advised students to develop an affinity towards nature and stressed the importance of protecting nature and preserving culture for a better future. “Love and Live with Nature,” he told them.

Saying that students must spend half the school time in classrooms and the remaining time in the playgrounds, Shri Naidu asked students to focus their energies on aspects such as sports, games, arts, dance, music, and crafts. 

The Vice President also wanted the students to develop an inquisitive mind and understand subjects in a concept-based manner rather than by rote method. He stressed that it was important to learn to do things and develop a pragmatic outlook.

Shri Naidu, while expressing concern over the spread of lifestyle diseases advised all of them to develop the habit of practicing Yoga or Exercise and not get swayed by junk food and always eat healthy food.

The Vice President also asked students not to get disappointed or disheartened if they did not get the expected marks and told them that the report card was not the end of education.

Apart from holding one-on-one talks with the leaders of Vietnam, the Vice President will participate in the 16th United Nations Day of Vesak at Tam Chuc pagoda in Vietnam's northern Ha Nam province, on May 12 and deliver the keynote address at the inaugural session of the event themed as ""Buddhist Approach to Global Leadership and Shared Responsibilities for Sustainable Societies.""

 

Upon his arrival in Vietnam’s Capital Honoi, Shri Naidu will address the Indian Community at a reception hosted by the Ambassador of India.

 

The next day, the Vice President will pay tributes to martyrs at the National Monument of Heroes and Martyrs and proceed to Presidential palace where he will be accorded a ceremonial welcome.

 

Shri Naidu will interact with the Vice President of Vietnam, Mr. Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh and hold delegation level talks. He will also meet Mr. Mme. Nguyen Kim Thi Ngan, Chairperson of National Assembly of Vietnam.

 

During the high level talks, the Vice President and his hosts are expected to discuss a wide range of issues including trade & investment relations. Giving better market access to India’s exports, exploring opportunities in oil and gas sectors, seeking support for Indian Pharmaceutical facilities in Vietnam, cooperation in defence and space technologies, training and capacity building of Vietnamese defence forces and strengthening of cultural bonds between the two nations are expected to figure during the talks.

On May 12, Shri Naidu will participate in the inaugural function of the 16th United Nations Day of Vesak at Tam Chuc pagoda in Vietnam's Ha Nam province and will deliver the key note address.

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon public representatives to always strive for fulfilling the aspirations of the people and uphold the dignity of institutions they represent. He wanted public representatives to fulfill the responsibility bestowed upon them by people and make optimum use of their tenure as MPs, MLAs and members of local bodies in nation-building.

Addressing the gathering after releasing a Telugu book titled, “Grameena Prajavani- Sunkara Satyanarayana Shasana Mandali Prasangalu” (Speeches of Sunkara Satyanarayana in Legislative Council of Andhra Pradesh) by Raitu Nestam Publications in New Delhi today, Shri Naidu said that people like Sri Satyanarayana raised the level of debates through their oratory skills and commitment to the cause of people. 

The Vice President went down the memory lane and recollected his days as a legislator in Andhra Pradesh Assembly. He wanted the younger generation to listen to past speeches of eminent legislative members like Shri Tenneti Viswanadham, Shri Gouthu Latchanna, Shri Puchalapalli Sundarayya and Shri Sunkara Satyanaraya and learn from their erudition.

Shri Naidu appealed to all those in public life to raise matters of crucial importance such as agriculture, education, rural development, healthcare and effective implementation of schemes.

He called upon political parties, members of parliament and legislators to reorient their approach towards making a constructive role and said that there was every need to raise the level of debate in legislatures. He emphasized that it was the sacred duty of public representatives to maintain the sanctity of institutions such as Parliament and state legislatures. 

While expressing his concern over the increasing disruptions of proceedings of parliament and assemblies, Shri Naidu appealed all political parties to evolve a code of conduct for their members ensure that meaningful debates take place in legislatures.

The Vice President wanted media to highlight constructive debate on crucial issues concerning the people, especially those living in remote areas.

                The Vice President Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has called for adopting a public transport-centric approach to decongest traffic-choked cities and combat growing vehicular pollution. He observed that our cities have been witnessing an undesirable shift from the use of public transport to private vehicles.

‘The average two-wheeler and car ownership levels in metropolitan cities which were 112 and 14 per 1000 population in 1994 are expected to grow to 393 and 48 respectively by 2021. This would mean 53 million two-wheelers and six million cars in the next 15 years in metropolitan cities,’ he added. 

Speaking at the 25th Foundation Day event of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) in New Delhi today, he said urban transportation solutions like the metro rails have the capacity to act as driving forces to take India’s quest for sustainable urban spaces to fruition.

Lauding the DMRC, Shri Naidu said that it presents a blue print for development of metro services not only to the other cities in India but also to a number of developing countries.

Pointing out that urban transport was leading to growing air and noise pollution, he said that it was estimated to account for about 25 percent of the greenhouses gases worldwide and spending more time in the polluted atmosphere was adversely affecting the health of the people, the Vice President said and added that the need for clean urban mobility cannot be over emphasized.

Referring to the deleterious effects of global warming and climate change, he said “we need to swiftly move from fossil fuel based automobiles to electricity or battery based vehicular system”.

He said that a relevant infrastructure, especially in regard to charging of batteries had to be developed on an urgent basis to meet the emerging demand for electric vehicles.

Stressing the need to put in place an adequately developed reliable, affordable and accessible urban public transport system, Shri Naidu called for steps on a war footing to make public transport the most popular mode of travel for all commuters.

The Vice President asked planners to provide hassle-free travel facilities and said that ensuring the last mile connectivity to commuters, especially for those travelling by metro and local rail networks. 

He urged cities to increasingly focus on introducing multi-modal transit systems. “Public transport should take precedence over personalized motor transport and every stakeholder should work in that direction”, he added.

The Vice President also wanted city planners to make urban spaces safe for women, children and the elderly and make them completely barrier-free and accessible to the differently abled. 

Shri D.S. Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs & Chairman, DMRC, Shri Vijay Kumar, Chief Secretary, GNCTD, Dr. Mangu Singh, Managing Director, DMRC, Shri K.K. Saberwal, Director (Finance), DMRC and employees of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation were present at the event.

 

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am delighted to be here today at the 25th Foundation Day celebrations of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The Delhi Metro has been instrumental in ushering in a new era of sustainability and comfort in the urban mass transportation arena in India. 

In these 25 years, DMRC has shown the world that India is capable of executing major infrastructure projects within time and budgetary constraints, while strictly adhering to world class standards. 

The Delhi Metro presents a blue print for development of metro services not only to the other cities in India but also to a number of developing countries.

DMRC has continuously adopted the latest technologies to present to the citizens a world class mass transit system which is comfortable, safe as well as environment friendly. 

In many ways, the Delhi Metro is the symbol of the immense progress that our country has made in the last few years. 

It is heartening to note that it is the first ever rail based system in the world to claim carbon credits for its regenerative braking and modal shift technologies. 

According to a study, Delhi Metro has helped in removing about seven lakh vehicles from the streets of Delhi, reducing congestion on arterial roads of the nation’s capital. 

Having constructed a massive network of 373 Km with 271 stations (including the NOIDA – Greater NOIDA Corridor) in record time, the DMRC today stands out as a shining example of how a mammoth technically complex infrastructure project can be completed before time and within the budgeted cost by a Government agency. 

It is truly appreciable that DMRC is also working towards developing robust last mile connectivity from the Metro stations. It is especially important for vulnerable sections of our population, especially the women, the elderly and the differently abled. 

 

I am told that services such as e-rickshaws and cab counters are now available at a number of metro stations.

My dear sisters and brothers,

India has embarked on a journey to prepare for rapid Urbanization. Our cities offer tremendous opportunities for growth and act as engines of prosperity. Cities are the main creators of economic wealth, generating a lion’s share of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In India, the GDP contribution of cities is expected to grow to 70% by 2030. 

Approximately 33% of India’s population is urban. The Annual report of Ministry of Urban Development, 2017 estimates that by 2030, urban population in India would cross 590 million with 68 cities having a population of more than a million.

We are witnessing migration to cities at an unprecedented rate. Today, our cities demand 21st century solutions to accommodate the growing population and to improve the quality of lives of its inhabitants.

Our urban spaces are growing fast. 

Our cities are now are expanding into sub-urban and peri-urban areas. We have to be fully prepared to plan and manage this growth so that we build ‘People friendly Cities’ which are liveable, sustainable, provide wealth creation opportunities and enhance happiness, generosity, religious harmony and promote diversity, inclusion and peaceful co-existence. 

India now dreams of creating smart urban spaces. 

‘Smart city’ is an umbrella term, an all-encompassing vision of an urban space that is eco-friendly, technology integrated and meticulously planned with specific reliance on the utilization of Information Technology to improve the delivery of services and the quality of life. 

However, our road to realizing the vision of Smart Cities is obstructed by a number of challenges.

Our cities face several gaps in infrastructure and service delivery. 

There are issues of congestion, inadequate public transport facilities, insufficient provisions for sanitation and waste management, power and water supply shortages and severe pollution.

We must put in place urban governance systems that are transparent, accountable and participative and adopt a multi-disciplinary, multi-pronged approach to solve complex problems.

We have to make our urban spaces safe for women, children and the elderly and make them completely barrier free and accessible to the differently abled. We have to inject much more funds into urban development and create stable institutions to manage resources sustainably. 

Urban transport is a crucial component of urban infrastructure. A poor urban transport system not only constrains economic growth but also degrades the quality of life through congestion, pollution, accidents etc. 

We need to adopt a Public Transport centric approach to fight pollution, climate change and the congestion on roads. We all are aware that accessibility and urban mobility are critical for promoting sustainable urban economic development in Indian cities.

In view of the deleterious effects of global warming and climate change, we need to swiftly move from fossil fuel based automobiles to electricity or battery based vehicular system. Relevant infrastructure, especially in regard to charging of batteries has to be developed on an urgent basis to meet the emerging demand for electric vehicles. 

Apart from promoting hybrid or electric cars and electric buses, we need to give priority to Rail based MRTS systems, including sub-urban rails.

The extent to which the Indian cities can maximize their economic performance and reduce poverty will be closely linked to how efficiently its transport system moves people and goods. 

In the recent times, our cities have been witnessing an undesirable shift from the use of public transport to private vehicles. The average two-wheeler and car ownership levels in metropolitan cities which were 112 and 14 per 1000 population in 1994 are expected to grow to 393 and 48 respectively by 2021.

This would mean 53 million two wheelers and 6 million cars in the next 15 years in metropolitan cities. 

Absence of adequate mass transportation in these cities would result in an increase in atmospheric pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and lead to further congestion on roads.

 It is estimated that urban transport accounts for about 25 per cent of the greenhouses gases worldwide and is increasingly leading to air and noise pollution in cities. Spending more time in a polluted atmosphere is adversely affecting the health of the population. Therefore, the need for clean urban mobility cannot be over emphasized. 

With burgeoning population and unplanned urbanization, the demand for motorized travel has increased by leaps and bounds in recent decades, thus creating challenges on economic, social and environmental fronts. Our cities need to increasingly focus on introducing multi modal transit systems. Public transport should take precedence over personalized motor transport and every stakeholder should work in that direction.

Our cities are finding it difficult to cope with the rapid rise in personalized motor vehicles and there is no other alternative but to deliver a safe and sustainable public transport. The most important aspect for transport systems such as metro rails is to ensure the last mile connectivity so that commuters enjoy hassle-free travel.

These days, people have to spend considerable time in travelling from their homes to work places. Traffic snarls are adding to their woes. Lack of adequate public transport is forcing people to use personal vehicles. This situation needs to be remedied on a war footing and public transport should become the most popular mode of travel for all commuters.

The need of the hour is to put in place an adequately developed reliable, affordable and accessible urban public transport system. I would like to share a quote by Mr Enrique Penelosa, the mayor of Bogota who said: “A developed country is not where the poor use cars but where the rich use public transport.”

As a matter of fact, cyclists and pedestrians face harrowing time and have to often jostle for space. That’s why I have been suggesting that all cities should have dedicated cycle tracks and pedestrian paths. Promoting walking and cycling would also have a positive impact on health.

Transport sector is already the second largest consumer of energy in India. The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has estimated that India’s commercial energy demands and emissions will increase by about 6 to 7 times by 2031-32 from the levels in 2011 unless drastic reform measures are envisioned and implemented dedicatedly.  

It is clear that urban transportation needs our urgent and undivided attention. The need for better transportation system is undeniable.

The successful Delhi Metro experience has strengthened the case of metro rail as a sustainable, environment friendly and viable urban transportation option. 

I am told that more than 664 kms of Metro Rail Projects are under various stages of implementation in 15 cities. 

I am happy to note that the Metro Rail Policy notified by the government seeks to focus on systematic planning and implementation of metro rail systems. I am told that it enables greater private participation and innovative financing through Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Value Capture Finance (VCF).  With the new policy in place, I am sure that DMRC with its rich experience could guide other metro rail projects in their execution.  All the stakeholders must look at the feasibility of the projects in a holistic manner by considering the economic, environmental and social aspects. 

The utility of any metro rail project would greatly depend on how well it is integrated into the spatial and functional layout of the city. 

It is also essential to integrate various modes of transport to ensure seamless connectivity for commuters. The modal integration has to be at three levels—physical, operational and fare integration. 

Facilitating direct connection from one mode to another and introducing common mobility card would go a long way in improving the overall ecosystem of the public transport system. For any metro rail to function well, it needs a good feeder bus network, connecting pedestrian paths and seamless modal transfer.

Apart from adopting PPP models for development of urban transport systems, there is also need to adopt innovative financing methods like issuance of bonds.  

We must also strive to continually improve the functioning of our metro system, upgrade technologies and improve safety systems while keeping the fares low so that metro travel becomes affordable to every last citizen. 

Urban transportation solutions like the metro rails have the capacity to act as driving forces to take this quest for sustainable urban spaces to fruition.

Today, the Delhi Metro is one of the largest Metro rail networks in the world. It must be one of the fastest expanding networks as well. 

As it moves forward towards many new achievements, I wish it all success and hope that DMRC will scale many new frontiers and bring laurels to the nation. 

Thank You! 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President, Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu released a postage stamp to commemorate the 750th birth anniversary of Sri Vedanta Desikan in New Delhi today. He said that our textbooks must throw light on the lives of great saints and spiritual icons such as Sri Vedanta Desikan so that our children internalize and practice the lofty ideals of humanism, peace and compassion propagated by them.

‘Sri Vedanta Desikan is one of the most prominent preceptors in the Srivaishnava tradition and one of the most effulgent luminaries to have graced this land’, the Vice President added. Initiatives like bringing out commerative postage stamps were not only meant to pay tribute to the great contributions of visionaries like Sri Vedanta Desikan but also aimed at inspiring our younger generation to follow in their footsteps.

The Vice President termed Sri Vedanta Desikan’s scholarship as truly outstanding and said that he had authored brilliant poems, prose, drama, epics, commentaries, scientific texts and philosophical treatises in Sanskrit, Tamil, Prakrit and Manipravalam.

Shri Naidu emphasized that Vedanta Desikan was much more than a spiritual teacher and said that he was a multi-faceted personality-- a scientist, a logician, a mathematician, a literary genius, a linguist, a military strategist and much more.

Referring to Sri Vedanta Desikan’s humility and non-attachment to worldly honors and his affinity to a life of simplicity and service, the Vice President said Sri Desikan considered the grace of the Lord he worshipped and served as his greatest treasure.

Pointing out that one of the essential features of Sri Vedant Desikan’s philosophy was the aspect of inclusion, Shri. Naidu said that anyone, irrespective of caste and creed could join the Sri Vaishnava fold. ‘This is a truly democratizing movement that obliterated caste distinctions’, he added. 

The Vice President condemned the several acts of terror that had shocked the collective consciousness of the world in the recent times and stated unequivocally that terrorism had no religion. Shri Naidu termed terrorism as the greatest enemy of humanity and welcomed the listing of Masood Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN Security Council. He called for world peace and said that peace and humanity formed the basis of the spiritual teachings of great saints like Sri Vedanta Desikan

The Vice President expressed hope that organizations like Sri Vedanta Desikan Manipaduka Indraprastha Trust would propagate Sri Vedant Desikan’s timeless message to the younger generation. ‘It is only through such understanding that the true greatness of our illustrious land can be fully appreciated’, he said.

The Vice President also stressed that massive public awareness and education campaigns must be undertaken to bring to the fore luminaries such as Sri Vedant Desikan who have shaped our Bharat into a “Jnana Bhoomi”.

Shri Mohan Parasaran, Former Solicitor General of India, Shri Vishvapavan Pati, Additional Director General, Department of Posts, Shri R. Mukunthan, General Secretary, Delhi Tamil Sangam, Shri R. Sriraman, Founder Trustee, Sri Vedanta Desikan Manipaduka Indraprastha Trust and others were present on the occasion.

 

The following is the full text of the speech:

It is indeed a great pleasure and privilege to release a postage stamp to commemorate the 750th birth anniversary of Sri Vedanta Desikann.

Sri Vedanta Desikan is one of the most prominent preceptors in the Srivaishnava tradition, and one of the most effulgent luminaries to have graced this land.

A precocious child, Venkatanatha, who later became Sri Vedanta Desikann, had mastered the Vedas, the Vedangas, the 4000 Divya Prabhanda and all the existing schools of Indian philosophy such as Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Purva Mimamsa, Yoga and Sankhya by the age of 20.

What is so striking about his life is that while he could have easily lived a life of great prosperity due to his unprecedented fame, he and his wife, Thirumangai chose to live a very simple life.

Sri Vedanta Desikann’s scholarship was truly outstanding.

He wrote poems, prose, drama, epics, commentaries, scientific texts and philosophical treatises in Sanskrit, Tamil, Prakrit and Manipravalam.

It is no wonder that he was awarded many titles for his astonishingly vast range of achievements. He was celebrated as ‘sarva-tantra-svatantra’or master of all arts and crafts; awarded the title ‘kavi tarkika-kesari’, the lion amongst poets and logicians; and glorified as ‘ramanuja-daya-patram’, the recipient of Ramanuja’s blessings.

His mastery and brilliance brought him fame and distinction. But what is remarkable is his humility and genuine non-attachment to worldly honours. Vedanta Desikan rejected the offer of joining the court of the King of Vijayanagara and considered that the greatest treasure he had was the grace of the Lord.

His magnum opus, the Rahasya Traya Sara, is a masterly treatise on Prapatti or surrendering oneself to the divine.

But Vedanta Desikan was much more than a spiritual teacher. He was a multi-faceted personality-- a scientist, a logician, a mathematician, a sculptor, a civil engineer, a poet, a literary genius, a linguist, a geologist, a dietician, a behavioural scientist, a military strategist and much more.

We are truly blessed that we are commemorating today this great legendary icon, an outstanding genius who greatly enriched our cultural and intellectual heritage.

His masterpiece, Paduka Sahasram, reveals his poetic eloquence and his mathematical ingenuity. In two verses in this collection, Sri Vedanta Desikann gave a solution to a mathematical problem that was solved five centuries later by another mathematician, Leonard Euler.

Desikan showed his knowledge of the arts and sciences through other works such as Silpartha-saram, a treatise on sculpture, and Bhugola-nirnayam – a research text on geography. 

Taking cues from the Vedic scriptures, Vedanta Desikan authored Aahaara Niyamam that detailed how different food items help in maintaining a healthy mind and a disease-free life.

His ‘Subhashita Neevi’ contains a fund of moral and ethical advice which is relevant and practical.

Desikan’s talent as a military strategist came to the fore during the repeated invasions of the holy city of Srirangam by the forces of the Delhi Sultanate. Before the forces of marauding invaders like Mallik Kafur and Ulugh Khan arrived at Srirangam in 1327, Desikan hid the main Deity of the temple behind a newly built wall, and escaped with rare manuscripts that would otherwise have been destroyed by the invaders. The smaller festival Deities were smuggled out by other devotees and carried to Tirupati, where they were worshipped secretly for many years.

Incidents from Desikan’s life demonstrate many qualities that we should try to imbibe.

Leading a very active life and achieving success in diverse fields, he scaled the greatest spiritual heights as well as other fields of knowledge and human welfare. His versatile intellectual and creative output did not make him vain or pompous. He remained a humble devotee of the Lord he believed in. Humility was his hallmark, simplicity his strength.

The Sri Vaishnava philosophy that Saint Ramanuja initially propounded got a much wider audience with Vedanta Desikann’s writings and preachings. One of the essential features of this philosophy was the aspect of inclusion. Anyone, irrespective of caste and creed could join the Sri Vaishnava fold. This is a truly democratizing movement that obliterated caste distinctions. 

As Sri Vaishnavites laud him, he has been an extraordinary individual who has shown us a new path towards human fulfillment and spiritual upliftment. It is as if Lord Srinivasa Himself has appeared as an Acharya to illuminate the paths of devotion and dedication, of selfless love and affection for humanity and a total submergence in divine ambience.

I am glad that the Department of Posts has bought out this postage stamp to commemorate the 750th birth anniversary of this great saint.

I wish this provides an opportunity for all of us to deepen our understanding of Sri Vedanta Desikann’s contribution to the cultural tradition of our great land and hopefully, organizations like Sri Vedanta Desikan Manipaduka Indraprastha Trust will propagate his timeless message to the younger generation.

It is only through such understanding that the true greatness of our illustrious land can be fully appreciated. We need a massive public awareness and education campaign to bring to the fore such luminaries who have shaped our Bharat into a “Jnana Bhoomi”.

Jai Hind !

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that public satisfaction must be the yardstick to measure the performance of public servants.

He wanted them to improve knowledge and acquire technical skills and constantly learn from the global best governance practices to make the Indian administrative system better, efficient and effective. 

Shri Naidu, while addressing Assistant Secretaries, Section Officers, and employees of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat in New Delhi, asked them to rise to the occasion and strive to fulfill the aspirations of people, especially the youth.

Emphasizing that responsive and efficient governance mechanism was the need of the hour, Shri Naidu wanted officials to ensure time-bound delivery of public services in a transparent manner.

The Vice President advised them to review, reform and refine working methods and procedures to ensure that the benefits of government programs reach the last man in the line. “Everyone must perform his or her duty with sincerity, honesty, integrity, and discipline”, he added.   

Suggesting that all administrative matters must be carried out in the State’s official language, Shri Naidu urged them to be sympathetic to the needs of people who come to them with their grievances.

More than 30 officers from the finance department of Andhra Pradesh have called on Vice President. They are undergoing a month-long training program at National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM), Faridabad in areas such as expenditure management, budget management, and fiscal responsibility and taxation.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi met H.E Mr Md. Abdul Hamid, President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh at noon today at Hyderabad House.

During the meeting, the leaders expressed great satisfaction at the excellent state of bilateral relations. The visiting President conveyed felicitations of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was unable to travel in person because of a prior commitment. He conveyed the invitation of the Government of Bangladesh to Prime Minister to visit that country, which was accepted with pleasure. The leaders agreed that dates would be decided through diplomatic channels.

Prime Minister Modi noted that the bilateral relationship, forged in Bangladesh’s War of Liberation, remained of the highest priority to India. In the past five years, the two countries had demonstrated great maturity and patience in resolving a number of complex pending issues, such as the demarcation of the Land Boundary. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of India and Bangladesh raising ties to a new level, as part of a joint effort to suitably commemorate the centenary of the birth of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (in 2020) and the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh’s Liberation, in 2021.

The President of Bangladesh was in India to attend the Swearing-in Ceremony of the new Government of India on May 30, 2019. The distinguished guest has earlier paid a State Visit to India in December 2014, as well as an official visit in March 2018, for the first meeting of the International Solar Alliance.

                In line with the Prime Minister’s vision for India’s safety, security and the well-being of those who protect the nation, the very first decision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on assuming his office is approval to a major change in the ‘Prime Minister’s Scholarship Scheme’ under the National Defence Fund.

The Prime Minister has approved the following changes:


	The rates of scholarship have been increased from Rs. 2000 per month to Rs. 2500 per month for boys and from Rs. 2250 per month to Rs. 3000 per month forgirls.
	The ambit of the Scholarship Scheme is extended to the wards of State Police officials who are/were martyred during terror/naxal attacks. The quota of new scholarships for wards of state police officials will be 500 in a year. The Ministry of Home Affairs will be the nodal Ministry in this regard.


Background:

The National Defence Fund (NDF) was set up in 1962 to take charge of the

voluntary donations in cash and kind received for promotion of the national

defence effort, and to decide on their utilisation.

Currently the fund is being used for the welfare of the members of the Armed Forces, Para Military forces and Railway Protection Force, and their dependents. The fund is administered by an Executive Committee with the Prime Minister as the Chairperson and the Defence, Finance and Home Ministers as Members.

Under National Defence Fund major scheme of ‘Prime Minister’s Scholarship Scheme (PMSS)’ is being implemented to encourage technical and post-graduate education for the widows and wards of the deceased/ex-service personnel of Armed Forces and Para Military Forces and Railway Protection Force. Scholarships are available for education at technical institutions (medical, dental, veterinary, engineering, MBA, MCA and other equivalent technical professions with suitable AICTE/UGC approval).

Under the PMSS, every year new scholarships are given for 5500 wards of armed forces controlled by Ministry of Defence, for 2000 wards of paramilitary forces controlled by Ministry of Home Affairs and for 150 wards of forces controlled by Ministry of Railways.

The National Defence Fund accepts online voluntary contributions through the website i.e. ndf.gov.in.

Supporting those who make our society more secure:

The Prime Minister has spoken at length about the monumental contribution of our police personnel. Come harsh summer, extreme winter or heavy monsoon, our police personnel are performing their duties with utmost diligence. Even during major festivals, our police personnel are on duty while the rest of the nation celebrates.

As a nation, it is our duty not only to express gratitude but also do things that improve the welfare of the police personnel and their families. It is in this spirit that the Prime Minister has taken the decision.. The availability of scholarship with enable more youngsters from police families to study and excel in different fields. It will have an empowering effect on several bright young minds.

It may be recalled that it was under the first tenure of PM Modi that a National Police Memorial was built and dedicated to the nation. This Memorial stands as a testimony to the courage and sacrifice of our policemen and will continue to inspire crores of Indians.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi spoke with H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, today.

The Prime Minister of Bangladesh had initiated the call to extend her congratulations on the clear mandate given by the people of India to the NDA Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. In doing so, PM Sheikh Hasina became one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate the Prime Minister, thus reflecting the extraordinarily close and cordial ties between India and Bangladesh, and the excellent rapport that the two leaders enjoy.

The two leaders pledged to continue to raise the India-Bangladesh relationship to unprecedented new heights. They recognised the importance of rapidly completing on-going plans for deepening the partnership in security trade, transportation, energy and people to people ties. Doing so within the next 3 years would have specific significance in view of the centenary of the birth of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 2020 and the 50thanniversary of Bangladesh's Liberation in 2021.

The leaders also agreed to identify dates for a meeting at the earliest, to resume work in service of the bilateral relationship.

Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today visited the State of Odisha to review the situation arising out of Cyclone Fani that hit the State on 3rd May, 2019.  He undertook an aerial survey of Pipili, Puri, Konark, Nimapada and Bhubaneswar. The Governor, Professor Ganeshi Lal, Chief Minister, Shri Naveen Patnaik and Union Cabinet Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan also accompanied the Prime Minister in the aerial survey.

Thereafter, Prime Minister took a meeting of the senior officers of the State and Central Government to take stock of the damage caused by the cyclone and the relief & rehabilitation measures being undertaken.  The Prime Minister assured all possible assistance to the State.  He announced immediate assistance worth Rs.1000 crores.  This is apart from Rs. 341 crores already released to the State Government on 29th April, 2019. He promised further assistance after the assessment by an inter-ministerial Central team.

The Prime Minister expressed his full solidarity with the people of Odisha. He said that the Central Government is fully committed not only for providing immediate relief, but also to ensure rebuilding of the state. He appreciated the role played by technology including satellite imagery and advanced weather forecasting techniques in minimising loss of life. He said that the combination of technological capabilities and human interface has enabled last mile connectivity with the affected. The State Government’s efforts in evacuating more than a million people to safety and the efforts of IMD to give accurate forecast were specially appreciated by the Prime Minister.  He appreciated the resilience of the people and the fishermen living in the coastal areas. He also expressed satisfaction at the excellent coordination between the Union and the State Government which helped to minimise causalities. The Prime Minister said that he knows the extent of damage and destruction such a cyclone brings, as he too has been a Chief Minister of a coastal state.

The Prime Minister assured that a Central team will visit the State soon to assess the extent of damage to infrastructure, housing, fishermen and farms and relief to be provided to the State.  He directed the State and Central Government officers of Power, Telecom, Railways to ensure restoration of services at the earliest.  He also directed the Road and Surface Transport Ministry to take effective steps for repair of roads damaged and also provide all assistance to the State in this regard. He directed that insurance companies must dispatch their observers immediately to the flood hit areas to assess the farmer’s claim related to crop insurance and provide them relief at the earliest.

 The Prime Minister announced ex-gratia of Rupees two lakhs to next of the kin of the deceased and Rupees fifty thousand to seriously injured in the cyclone.  The Prime Minister assured the people of the State that the Union Government stands shoulder to shoulder with them at this difficult time.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved  a new Central Sector Scheme, a historic decision that will empower farmers across India. This is a path breaking scheme that will provide pension cover to our industrious farmers who toil day and night to keep our nation fed. It is also for the first time since independence that such a pension coverage has been envisioned for farmers.

It is estimated that 5 crore small and marginal farmers will benefit in the first three years itself.  The Central Government would spend Rs. 10774.50 crore for a period of 3 years towards its contribution (matching share) for providing social security cover as envisaged under the scheme.

The salient features of this scheme are:

A voluntary and contributory pension scheme for all Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) across the country.

Entry age of 18 to 40 years with a provision of minimum fixed pension of Rs.3,000/- on attaining the age of 60 years. 

For example, a beneficiary farmer is required to contribute Rs 100/ - per month at median entry age of 29 years.  The Central Government shall also contribute to the Pension Fund an equal amount as contributed by the eligible farmer.  

After the subscriber’s death, while receiving pension, the spouse of the SMF beneficiary shall be entitled to receive 50% of the pension received by the beneficiary as family pension, provided he/she is not already an SMF beneficiary of the Scheme.  If, the death of the subscriber happens during the period of contribution, the spouse shall have the option of continuing the Scheme by paying regular contribution. 

Synergy between schemes, prosperity for farmers:

An interesting feature of the Scheme is that the farmers can opt to allow his/her monthly contribution to the Scheme to be made from the benefits drawn from the Pradhan Mantri KisanSAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme directly. Alternatively, a farmer can pay his monthly contribution by registering through Common Service Centres (CSCs) under MeitY.  

Fulfilling core promises, empowering the agriculture sector:

For seventy years after Independence, such a coverage for farmers was never thought. It was in the run up to the 2019 Parliamentary elections that PM Narendra Modi first mooted such an idea, which gradually found resonance across the length and breadth of India. Such a plan was mentioned in the BJP manifesto and in the first Cabinet meeting after the formation of a new Government, it has become a reality.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved that the ambit of the Pradhan Mantri KisanSamman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) would be comprehensively extended. With this decision, all land holding eligible farmer families (subject to the prevalent exclusion criteria) would avail of the benefits under this scheme. 

More beneficiaries, greater progress:

The revised Scheme is expected to cover around 2 crore more farmers, increasing the coverage of PM-KISAN to around 14.5 crore beneficiaries, with an estimated expenditure by Central Government of Rs. 87,217.50 crores for year 2019-20.  

Speed, scale and a major promise delivered: 

Today’s Cabinet decision pertaining to expanding the ambit PM-KISAN marks the fulfilment of a major promise made by the Prime Minister to the people of India in the run-up to the 2019 Parliamentary elections. The BJP manifesto too mentioned this major policy decision. 

It may also be noted that certain operational issues like lack of updated land records in Jharkhand and lack of Aadhaar penetration in states of Assam, Meghalaya and J&K have also been resolved.

PM-KISAN: A path-breaking support incentive for farmers:

The genesis of the PM-KISAN Yojana dates back to the interim Budget for the year 2019-2020. 

The key element of PM-KISAN is income support of Rs. 6000/- to the small and marginal landholder farmer families with cultivable land holding upto 2 hectare across the country. (This has been expanded today)

The amount is being released in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs.2000/- each over the year, to be credited into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries held in destination banks through Direct Benefit Transfer mode. 

The scheme was launched in a record time of 3 weeks, on 24th February at a huge programme in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh where the first rounds of instalments was paid to several farmers.

So far, 1st instalment to 3.11 crore beneficiaries and 2nd instalment to 2.66 crore beneficiaries have been credited directly to the bank accounts of the farmer families.

Serving India’s Annadatas with renewed vigour:

Time and again, PM Narendra Modi has spoken with great reverence for India’s farmers. He has described India’s farmers as our Annadatas who undertake great efforts to feed 1.3 billion Indians.

Between 2014 to 2019, numerous measures were taken to empower the hardworking farmer. This includes increase in the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 22 crops, Soil Health Cards, PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana, PM KisanSampada Yojana, e-NAM for better markets and more. These steps have made agriculture more prosperous and ensured greater productivity for farmers. They will go a long way in fulfilling the Prime Minister’s dream of doubling farmer incomes by 2022, when India marks 75 years of freedom.

                During the Union Cabinet Meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, the first since the outcome of the 2019 Lok Sabha election, a novel initiative was cleared that will benefit crores of farmers and improve the health of animals. 

This initiative pertains to controlling Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis to support the livestock rearing farmers. The Cabinet had cleared a total outlay of Rs. 13,343 crores to fully control these diseases amongst the livestock in the country in the next five years and subsequently eradicate these diseases.  

This decision indicates the spirit of compassion towards those animals who are a valued part of our planet but are not able to speak. 

The threat of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis:

These diseases are very common amongst the livestock – cow-bulls, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs etc. 

If a cow/buffalo gets infected with FMD, the milk loss is upto 100% which could last for four to six months. Further, in case of Brucellosis the milk output reduces by 30%, during the entire life cycle of animal. Brucellosis also causes infertility amongst the animals. The infection of brucellosis can also be transmitted to the farm workers and livestock owners. Both the diseases have a direct negative impact on the trade of milk and other livestock products. 

The decision of the Cabinet today fulfils the major promise made in the manifesto as it provides much relief to crores of farmers in the country who rear livestock.

Care and compassion for animals:

          In case of FMD, the scheme envisages vaccination coverage to 30 crore bovines (cows-bulls and buffaloes) and 20 crore sheep/goat and 1 crore pigs at six months’ interval along with primary vaccination in bovine calves, while the Brucellosis control programme shall extend to cover 100% vaccination coverage of 3.6 crore female calves.  

          The programme so far has been implemented on cost sharing basis between the Central and State Governments. In a rare instance of departure, the Central Government has decided to now bear the entire cost of the programme to ensure complete eradication of these diseases and better livelihood opportunities for all the livestock rearing farmers in the country.

                India has a rich tradition of trade and commerce. Our traders continue to make a strong contribution to India’s economic growth.

In a decision that will benefit the trading community, the Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved a new scheme that offers pension coverage to the trading community. This is a part of the Prime Minister’s vision to provide a robust architecture of universal social security. 

How the scheme works:

Under this scheme all shopkeepers, retail traders and self-employed persons are assured a minimum monthly pension of Rs. 3,000/- month after attaining the age of 60 years.  

All small shopkeepers and self-employed persons as well as the retail traders with GST turnover below Rs. 1.5 crore and age between 18-40 years, can enrol for this scheme.  The scheme would benefit more than 3 crore small shopkeepers and traders. 

The scheme is based on self-declaration as no documents are required except Aadhaar and bank account. Interested persons can enrol themselves through more than 3,25,000 Common Service Centres spread across the country.  

The Government of India will make matching contribution in the subscribers’ account.  For example if a person with age of 29 years contributes Rs. 100/- month, then the Central Government also contributes the equal amount as subsidy into subscriber’s pension account every month. 

Delivering a major promise on Day 1:

By imitating a pension architecture for the trading community, the Prime Minister and his team have fulfilled a major promise made to the people of India. Shri Modi had spoken about the need of proving pension for traders, that would assure them a life of dignity and financial security especially when during their old age. 

This decision can also be seen in the light of several other steps taken for the welfare of traders, small and medium business. The GST underwent significant simplification after taking feedback of the trading community. In the same way, Mudra loans gave wings to the entrepreneurial zeal of young India. Loans upto Rs. 1 crore are now easily available. 

These, and many more efforts would help the trading community.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval to the Resolution advising the President to dissolve the Sixteenth Lok Sabha, which was constituted on 18.05.2014.

Background:

Article 83(2) of the Constitution stipulates that the House of the People, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer and the expiration of the said period of five years shall operate as dissolution of the House.  The first meeting of the Sixteenth Lok Sabha was held on June 4, 2014, when members were administered oath and affirmation.  The life of the present Lok Sabha is, therefore, to expire on June 3, 2019, unless the President dissolves it earlier.

A statement showing the last dates of the polls, dates of the constitution, first sitting and expiration of term and dissolution of the First to Fifteenth Lok Sabha is attached.

                Radial Rib antenna (RRA) is a world class technology demonstrated in-orbit on 22.05.19 at 2:20 pm IST in RISAT-2B spacecraft. This 3.6 metre antenna was folded & stowed during launch and later successfully unfurled & deployed in-orbit. The deployment was completed in 7 mins and 20 seconds.

 

Development of light weight structure, hinge mechanism, design of newer mesh, actuators etc., were some of the challenges involved in the realisation of this antenna. All such key technological elements require very high level of expertise in handling space based antenna system, excellent workmanship and building redundancy apart from managing its in-orbit deployment.

 

The antenna was realised indigenously by ISRO team in a record time of 13 months. Alternate import option would have taken about 3-4 years. Successful deployment of RRA in RISAT-2B establishes the combination of all skills mastered by ISRO indigenously.

                India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C46) today successfully launched the RISAT-2B satellite from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. This was the 72nd launch vehicle mission from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota and 36th launch from the First Launch pad.

PSLV-C46 lifted-off at 05:30 Hrs (IST) from the First Launch Pad and injected RISAT-2B into a orbit of 556 km, about 15 minutes and 25 seconds after lift-off. After separation, solar arrays of RISAT-2B were deployed automatically and ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) at Bengaluru assumed control of the satellite. In the coming days, the satellite will be brought to its final operational configuration.

RISAT-2B is a radar imaging earth observation satellite weighing about 615 kg. The satellite is intended to provide services in the field of Agriculture, Forestry and Disaster Management.

ISRO Chairman Dr K Sivan congratulated the launch vehicle and satellite teams involved in the mission. “With this launch, PSLV lofts 50 tonnes to space by launching 354 satellites, including national, student and foreign satellites.”

Dr. K Sivan also commended the efforts of the team involved in the realization of the piggyback payload carried onboard this mission namely, Vikram processor and low cost MEMS based Inertial Navigation System (INS) developed by Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), Chandigarh and ISRO Inertial Systems Unit, Thiruvananthapuram respectively. “RISAT-2B is an advanced Earth Observation satellite with an advanced technology of 3.6m radial rib antenna”, he added.

A total number of 5,000 visitors witnessed the launch live from the Viewer’s Gallery, which is opened to the public.

ISRO is now gearing up for the launch of Chandrayaan-2 onboard GSLV MkIII during the window of July 09, to July 16, 2019, with an expected Moon landing on September 06, 2019.

                Chandrayaan-2, India’s second lunar mission, has three modules namely Orbiter, Lander (Vikram) & Rover (Pragyan). 

The Orbiter and Lander modules will be interfaced mechanically and stacked together as an integrated module and accommodated inside the GSLV MK-III launch vehicle. 

The Rover is housed inside the Lander. After launch into earth bound orbit by GSLV MK-III, the integrated module will reach Moon orbit using Orbiter propulsion module. Subsequently, Lander will separate from the Orbiter and soft land at the predetermined site close to lunar South Pole. Further, the Rover will roll out for carrying out scientific experiments on the lunar surface. Instruments are also mounted on Lander and Orbiter for carrying out scientific experiments.

 

All the modules are getting ready for Chandrayaan-2 launch during the window of July 09 to July 16, 2019, with an expected Moon landing on September 06, 2019.

            The Ministry held in its presentation that the world economy was getting increasingly digital, and it detailed the disruptive potential of digital technology which is accelerating transition   Elaborating on the digital profile of India, the Commission was briefed by Ministry that India was standing on the verge of a trillion dollar digital opportunity.  It was stressed that large scale digital transformation is possible,  however India can and must prepare for it.

            In its Memorandum to the Commission, MeitY has made some specific suggestions-


	The Digital India programme requires unprecedented IT capability for States/ UTs to achieve its objectives and transforms India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy.  The continuation of the ICT infrastructure and capacity building schemes is vital for States/ UTs to build ICT capability towards the implementation of the ‘Digital India’ programme. It has asked for allocation of funds for these projects.
	As the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) is not a Centrally Sponsored Scheme any more, the Ministry has asked for separate funds for the NeGP Scheme.
	It has proposed continuous Union support for funding under CSS the implementation of the core ICT infrastructure such as State Data Centres (SDC), State Wide Area Network (SWAN), State Service Delivery Gateway (SSDG), e-Districts etc. 
	The Ministry has also asked the Commission to consider the following criteria while allocation of resources and proposing performance based incentives to States.



	Digital Infrastructure.

                The Finance Commission held consultations with senior officials of the Ministry of Finance on yesterday on the overall economic situation and key economic variables.  These discussions are credible to the ongoing work of the Commission to reach an appropriate conclusion on both the vertical and the horizontal devolution.  Apart from the Commission’s Chairman & Members Shri Ajay Narayan Jha, Dr. Anoop Singh, the Finance Ministry were represented by Shri Subhash Chandra Garg Finance Secretary, Shri Ajay Bhushan Pandey Revenue Secretary,  Shri Girish Chandra Murmu, Expenditure Secretary, Dr. Krishnamurthy Subramanian Chief Economic Adviser, Shri P C Mody Chairman CBDT, Shri P.K. Das, Chairman CBIC and other senior officials of the Finance Ministry and the Finance Commission.

The Commission observed that the GDP numbers have somewhat fluctuated within the overall global trend which suggests continued high growth trend over the medium term. The Commission also noted that the revenue projections on the Direct Taxes are healthy though on Indirect Taxes, there have been periodic fluctuations. On the expenditure trend, there were discussions in regard to the rationalisation of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes in sync with the new life cycle, they being co-terminus with the Finance Commissions.

Detailed discussions have continued over the last few months with the Finance Ministry on the issues of the consequences of UDAY and 7th Pay Commission particularly in the context of the finances of the States.  

The Finance Ministry presented before the Commission some preliminary views of the Government on the Financial Terms of Reference of the Commission.  The economic development in the last 5 years were analysed in detail with specific focus on Growth, Investments, Industrial Production, Banking and Payments, Inflation and Monetary Policy, External Sector, Medium Term Outlook.  The Ministry made its projections for 2018-19 and 2019-20 to the Commission along with its projections for the award period of the XVFC, which is 2020-21 to 2024-25.

The Finance Ministry gave some accounts and overviews of Receipt and Expenditure Forecast including a fiscal overview of XIVFC vs. XVFC both a percentage of GDP and as percentage of GRR.  They also made a resource forecast which included tax projections; and a comparative picture of tax growth and buoyancy.  The expenditure projections made by the Ministry included expenditure classifications and requirements; expenditure of the Central Government during the award period of the XIVFC and the expenditure requirements during the award period of the XVFC.

The Ministry and the Commission had a detailed discussion on fiscal management in which the Ministry put up a number of suggestions for consideration of the Commission.  Discussions were also held on GST issues, local body grants and population data.

The Commission is now awaiting the full Memorandum of the Government of India through Finance Ministry which is expected to be delivered soon.

                The 15th Finance Commission addressed the media in Mumbai today, briefing them about the discussions that took place in the Commission’s meetings with RBI, banks and eminent economists during the Commission’s two-day visit to the city during May 8 – 9, 2019.

Stating that the visit of the Commission was very productive, the Chairman said:

“The meetings have sharpened the Commission’s understanding on some of the key things that need to be kept in mind for continued macroeconomic stability. A careful examination was made into the issues of debt, particularly as stated in the RBI’s Annual Report on State Debt Figures. The overall debt picture of the states and the way they have complied with the ingredients of the Macroeconomic Management Bill is being looked into closely. This is an area we have had very useful discussion.

Some states are financially well-managed, others financially poorly managed. What are the mechanisms by which the market makes its voice felt in terms of the cost of borrowing and differentiate between better-governed states and not-so-well-governed states, especially given that states are increasingly resorting to market borrowings? This was explored through possible mechanisms such as encouraging credit ratings by states. While doing this, we also explored, particularly in light of the FRBM Report, as to what mechanisms can be further strengthened so as to enable the Central Government to conform to the targets it has laid for itself. The last five years has witnessed a Government which was quite committed to adhering to the fiscal deficit targets.

We also looked at more specific granular problems such as reconciliation of data, improving quality of statistics and data, and reliability and uniformity of data for enforcing greater fiscal discipline. Some very interesting ideas have come up, which we would deliberate upon.

What is the future of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)? The Central Government spends 3.5 lakh crore rupees per annum on these schemes. Past attempts at rationalizing these schemes have met with modest success. Earlier, the lifecycle of CSSs was coterminous with that of the Five Year Plans; they were hence subject to the mid-term appraisal of the Plan. Now, since there are no Five Year Plans, and hence no mid-term appraisal, the Central Government decided that it will now make the lifecycle of all CSSs coterminous with that of every Finance Commission. This year is the last year of the existing CSSs, before which they will move to the new cycle which will kick in as a result of our recommendations. From the viewpoint of the Central Government and others, this is an excellent opportunity for rationalization and simplification of CSSs. This is one area which is being deliberated upon.

The Finance Commission receives 30 Memorandums, one from the Central Government and 29 from each of the 29 states/UTs. We are awaiting the Memorandum of the Central Government, which we hope to receive soon, after which we will see what can be the appropriate vertical distribution of revenues between the Centre and the states.

The Commission has already visited 20 out of the 29 states. Visits to the remaining states will commence after the Model Code of Conduct period is over.”

Here are a few excerpts from the responses given by the Chairman to the questions posed by the media.


	 The issue of RBI’s reserves dealt by Bimal Jalan Committee report was not and should not have been discussed in depth by the Finance Commission and the RBI. This is an in-house matter of the RBI. In passing, it was mentioned to us that the Bimal Jalan Committee is in a fairly advanced stage of its deliberations.
	 We will await a Memorandum of the Central Government as regards the recapitalization of PCA Public Sector Banks, since the obligation for recapitalization will rest with the Central Government, and it will be for them to project the likely expenditure for the relevant period, through a Memorandum to the Finance Commission.
	We are closely looking at what kind of disaggregated growth, debt and fiscal deficit trajectory would be practical to attain the overall objective of the General Government’s debt and fiscal deficit being consistent with FRBM targets and yet within the bounds of practicality.
	We would like to capture the debt figures, the public sector borrowing requirements and contingent liabilities so that we get a true and holistic picture of the debt scenario. We have had discussions with RBI regarding this, and this is one area into which the Commission will be giving some attention.
	 The projections given to us by the Department of Revenue suggest very healthy buoyancy in direct taxes. Projections of indirect tax collections, especially with regard to GST, have not been as healthy. We are going to have another round of discussions with Department of Revenue based on the latest figures of the improvements in GST behavior and what changes can be made to make it more buoyant, stable and predictable.
	We ourselves are going to undertake a process of economic data reconciliation among the CAG, the RBI and the data which we have received from the Ministry of Finance and other sources, so that we can make conclusions based on what we would consider reliable data in public domain. This has nothing to do with the methodology or the computation of the data, but we are seeking reconciliation among the multiple sources of data. This reconciliation will be within the bounds of acceptable and appropriate prudence to be able to do so.

                The Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh, Members and Senior Officials of the 15th Finance Commission met a large group of Bankers and Heads of Financial Institutions in Mumbai today. 

Salient points raised by banks during their meeting with 15th Finance Commission on 9th May 2019.


	In the context of making the borrowing costs of State Governments aligned to their fiscal and governance fundamentals, the Automatic Debit Mechanism which is currently in vogue and the need for introducing rating of all public sector borrowers including States was discussed by the bankers.
	The bankers also mentioned that it is important to take a view on the total public sector borrowing requirements, as opposed to the narrowly defined Union and State fiscal deficits, to improve fiscal transparency and to ensure that markets get clear signals of the fund requirements of the public sector, ex ante.
	A few of the bankers mentioned that the maturity profile of outstanding borrowings of the Union and State Governments indicates that there is likely to be a repayment pressure during the next 4-5 years.
	The bankers also discussed their perspective in the areas of priority sector lending, loan waiver announced by Governments and its impact on credit culture, recapitalization of banks, foreign portfolio investment in Government securities, operationalization of sinking fund by States and raising of market borrowing by local self-governments.
	It was  also mentioned, in the context of horizontal devolution of Union taxes among States that fiscal discipline, transparency, governance improvements and revenue raising efforts of States be factored in appropriately.


 

The Bankers and Institutions who attended the meeting were, Mr.P.K. Gupta, State Bank of India, Ms. P. Sengupta, Bank of Baroda, Mr. Dina Bandhu Mohapatra, Bank of India, Mr. A.S. Rajeev, Bank of Maharashtra, Mr. Pallav Mohapatra, Central Bank of India, Mr. Manas Ranjan Biswal, Union Bank of India, Mr. Kaizad Bharucha, HDFC Bank Ltd, Mr. Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, HDFC Bank Ltd, Mr. Sandeep Batra, ICICI Bank Ltd, Mr. Arun Khurana, Indusind Bank, Mr. K.V.S.

                The Finance Commission met with eminent economists in Mumbai on 8th May, 2019, during its two-day visit to the city. The economists put forth a diverse array of issues for the consideration of the Commission; the salient issues are the following:


	There is a need to adopt a total view on the borrowing requirements of the consolidated public sector. This should encompass off-budget transactions, borrowings of the public sector undertakings and contingent liabilities of both the Union and State Governments. This is important from many angles, including debt sustainability, fiscal transparency and proper coordination of fiscal and monetary policies.
	It should be carefully examined whether the increased tax devolution by the 14th Finance Commission has led to improvements in the social spending of State Governments.
	There is possibly a mismatch between the demand and supply of state development loans, which can affect the cost of borrowings of state governments in the next five years.  Given the maturity profile of state loans, there can also be repayment pressure on these loans during the period of the 15th FC.
	Indications are that the fiscal deficit to GSDP ratio of the States taken as a whole is gradually declining, after the spike seen in 2015-16 and 2016-17.
	However, states are at vastly different stages of debt consolidation. Reaching the FRBM targets would involve an extremely difficult adjustment path for a few states.  However, it is important that the Union Government, and State Governments as a whole, consolidate their debt position.  According to some economists, expenditure adjustments alone cannot bring about the required adjustment; fresh revenue-raising efforts should also be made.  Proceeds from auctioning of mines could be a potential source of revenue.
	The quality of budgeting needs to improve.  Governments should not budget for a low fiscal deficit, knowing fully well that it cannot be achieved.  Projections of revenues from GST is tricky, but not impossible if one can work with the available data.
	Economists also made suggestions regarding the formula for horizontal devolution of Central taxes among States and the provision of grant-in-aid to the State Governments.  These suggestions related to weight of income distance in the devolution formula, the need to consider the quality of forests in addition to its quantity and the need to consider and incentivise human development through a system of grants or tax devolution.  A few economists also urged that intra-state inequality is another aspect that begs for the consideration of the Finance Commission.
	Given the shift from the use of 1971 population to 2001 population, some economists pointed towards the need for instituting an incentive structure in devolution.  The composition of population in terms of proportion of elderly in population is becoming significantly different across States.
	Some economists urged Finance Commission to consider reinstating the system of specific-purpose grants to ensure development of social sectors and other sectors that require handholding.  Finance Commission may also consider the need for achieving comparable service delivery standards across the country as its guiding principle.
	A suggestion was raised for Finance Commission to consider giving priority to the development of a very robust statistical system in the country in its recommendations.


Economists present at the meeting were: Dr. Rupa Rege Nitsure, Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Ms. Prachi Mishra, Dr. SamiranChakraborty, Ms. Pranjul Bhandari, Ms. Ashu Suyash, Shri Anjan Deb Bose, Shri Naresh Takkar, Shri Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Shri Ajit Ranade, Prof. Ashima Goyal and Dr. S. L. Shetty.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh today held a detailed meeting with the Governor and Deputy Governors of RBI in Mumbai today. 

Key issues raised by RBI Governor, Shri Shaktikanta Das and Finance Commission Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh were discussed in detail at the meeting. These issues  included the following:–

· The necessity of setting up State Finance Commissions for respective State Governments.

· Public Sector Borrowing Requirements.

· Continuity of the Finance Commission. It was felt that this was required more in view of  the  fiscal management requirements of the States, especially given the absence of mid-term reviews of Awards granted by the Finance Commission, as it used to happen earlier with the Awards granted by the Planning Commission.

· Need for Expenditure Codes, especially given that expenditure norms vary  from state to state.

· Role of States in Growth and Inflation, for instance,  role of states in Ease of doing Business.

The RBI made a detailed presentation to the Finance Commission,  on State Government Finances for 2019-20.  The key takeaways are: 

· The importance of states in the economy has increased with the shift in composition of government finances.

· Fiscal deficit of states is budgeted to be lower in 2019-20 BE, but RE and actuals deviate significantly (reflecting poor fiscal marksmanship).

· Specific factors drive fiscal slippages: these factors include UDAY in the past and farm loan waivers and income support schemes in 2018-19 RE.

· Outstanding debt as percentage of GDP rising despite moderation in interest payment as percentage of revenue receipts.

The RBI made another presentation on the issues and challenges of the market borrowings of state governments.  The main issues raised in this presentation were the following:

· Increasing  orientation of  state governments borrowing to markets.

· Improving secondary market liquidity – re-issuances, non-standard issuances, widening investor base.

· Risk Asymmetry- Phasing out of ADM, rating of SDLs, valuation of SDLs, more frequent disclosures.

· Strengthening the corpus of CSF/GRF – incentive for increasing the corpus, indicative target of 5% of outstanding liabilities/ guarantees by all states.

· Cash Management – States to improve their cash forecasting capabilities, states’ request to consider avenues for short term borrowings.

· Disclosures – Disclosure of high frequency data; budget presentations and release of financial data may be in a) common format b) within narrow time frame.

· Contingent liabilities – lack of reliable data, hence there is a need for standardization in compilation and reporting under FRBM and to    enforce uniform ceiling for issue of guarantees.

During its two-day visit to Mumbai, the Finance Commission is slated to have meetings with banks, financial institutions and economists as well.

                A delegation of 22 Political Parties met the Full Election Commission on 21st May 2019. Amongst other issues which they raised was the request to count VVPATs slips before the commencement of counting of votes polled in EVMs. 

Immediately after departure of the delegation, The Commission deliberated on the issue with senior officials dealing with this issue in ECI. After two rounds of in-depth discussions yesterday and today, it has neither been found possible nor feasible to accede to this demand in the overall context and especially in view of the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in Writ Petition (C) No.273 of 2019 delivered on 8.4.2019. The said judgement directs that the random selection of VVPATs shall be subjected to the process of slip verification as per the guidelines 16.6 of EVM Manual in force. (https://www.eci.gov.in/files/file/9230-manual-on-electronic-voting-machine-and-vvpat/ )

There were some other procedural issues like allowing counting agents of candidates along with all Returning Officers and Assistant Returning Officers on which necessary instructions have already been reiterated and wherever required made more candidate-friendly. 

The Commission while thanking all the esteemed Members of the delegation assures them and all the electors of the country that the entire counting especially guarding the strong rooms and counting centres is already being done in an absolutely fair and transparent manner.

                The Counting of Votes for General Election to the House of the People – 2019 shall be held on 23rd May, 2019.  In this regard, the Commission has come up with a new IT based initiative, which will enable the system in providing real-time trends and results of the vote counting across the States/UTs.  The counting trends and results will be available on the ECI Website at the URL https://results.eci.gov.in  as well as on the Voter Helpline App, both iOS and Android Mobile Apps.  The dissemination will start functioning from 8.00 a.m. on the Counting Day and would be continuously updated.

The Voter Helpline App can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or Apple Play Store.  For the first time, the citizens can use a smart phone to know the results.  They can use the available filter to find out the winning/leading or trailing candidate details, along with the Constituency-wise or State-wise results from the Voter Helpline App.  The citizens can bookmark their favourite candidate and watch the real-time results, as per their convenience on the Voter Helpline App or make a wish list to track the real-time status.

The local display of the trends and results by the CEOs/ROs/DEOs will also be done through the Digital Display Panels provided by Election Commission of India.

                Certain complaints of alleged movement of EVMs, purportedly to replace the polled EVMs in the strongrooms, have been doing the rounds in sections of media. Election Commission of India would like to emphatically and unambiguously clarify that all such reports and allegations are absolutely false, and factually incorrect. The visuals seen viral on media do not pertain to any EVMs used during the polls.

After the close of polls, all polled EVMs and VVPATs are brought under security cover to the designated strongrooms, which is sealed with double locks, in the presence of the candidates and in the presence of Observers of the Election Commission. The entire process of storage and sealing of the strongroom is covered under videography. Continuous CCTV coverage is done till completion of counting. Each strongroom is guarded with round-the-clock security by Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF). Further, the candidates or their designated agents remain present at the strongroom for 24X7 vigil at all times. 

On the counting day, the strongrooms are opened in the presence of the candidates/agents and Observer under videography. Before the counting of EVMs commences, the counting agents are shown the address tags, seals and serial number of the EVMs to satisfy themselves to the genuineness and authenticity of the machinesused in the actual polls.

The provisions and protocols have been explained to the political parties on multiple occasions including in several of the 93 meetings held with them at the Commission since announcement of elections. All Chief Electoral Officers and District Election Officers have again been advised to brief the candidates on the elaborate counting arrangements.

As can be appreciated, the detailed administrative protocols, security framework and procedural guidelines mandated by the Commission completely foreclose and pre-empt the possibility of any mischief or manipulation in the polled EVMs and VVPATs stored in the designated strongrooms under the 24X7 watch of the CAPF as well as the candidates.  

The aspersions in clips being used in media merely pertain to the storage or movement of Reserve unused EVMs. However any case of lapse even in handling of Reserve EVMs is thoroughly investigated and disciplinary action taken against the officers responsible. An EVM Control Room 011- 23052123 will also be functioning at Nirvachan Sadan for handling any EVM related complaints till the completion of counting. This will become operative from 11am on 22.5.2019.

Heads and Representatives of 20 Election Management Bodies (EMBs) from across the World, namely Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Fiji, Georgia, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Myanmar, Romania, Russia, Srilanka,  Suriname, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe and International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) have arrived in New Delhi to witness the ongoing General Elections to 17th Lok Sabha. More than 65 such delegates have been invited by Election Commission of India to join the Election Visitors Program. 



Addressing the participants, the Chief Election Commissioner, Shri Sunil Arora lauded the foresight and vision of forefathers of Indian Constitution in establishing the Election Commission of India a day before the promulgation of the Republic. While quoting from Article 324 of the Constitution of India, Sh Arora reiterated that Election Commission of India is firmly committed to ensure free, fair and robust elections in the country. He added that Election Commission of India had never been deterred by the sceptics & critics and as always, is committed to function as per the principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution of India by our visionary forefathers. ""The objective and intention of the Commission is to always keep learning from the experiences of the past for necessary course corrections for the future"" Shri Arora emphasised.

Citing vignettes from recent phases of election coverage, Shri Arora said further efforts would be made to make the election process more robust, ethical, inclusive, accessible and participative. CEC announced that Committees will be set up to study best practices from the States, document issues and challenges faced; further improve upon procedural measures to strengthen learnings from these Elections and identify critical gaps if any. Shri Arora also highlighted the recent IT initiatives taken and particularly the effectiveness of c-Vigil Application of the ECI which has truly empowered the citizens in help reporting instances of violations of MCC and play critical role in the entire electoral process.

Acknowledging the role of entire team of ECI in meeting the varied challenges in smoothly conducting elections in world’s largest democracy, Sh Arora, as a gesture of esprit de corps introduced the  ECI team leaders of different divisions at the headquarters to the Delegates. 

Election Commissioner Sh Ashok Lavasa recalled that India has come a long way from 1950 when World was skeptical of decolonized India being able to handle democracy. ""Its a tribute to forefathers of Indian Constitution that Universal Right to Vote was granted from day one"" he pointed out. ""We take comfort from the fact that from the first election of 1952 when mere170 million electorates, spread across 2lakh polling stations, the participative exercise of Indian Elections has now grown to more than 910 million voters for whom ECI machinery organizes more than 10 lakh polling stations"". Sh Lavasa noted that adoption and adaptation of technology embraced by ECI has helped manage this large scale electoral process, making it one of the largest management exercise in the World.

Shri Sushil Chandra in his address to the participants of the Election Visitors' Programme highlighted the comprehensive preparations set in place by ECI for the conduct of elections to the 17th Lok Sabha across 543 Parliamentary Constituencies of the country along with General Elections to the State Legislatures of Andhra Pradesh, Arunanchal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim, in a free, fair and peaceful manner. ""Abuse of money power in Elections is widely recognized as the greatest challenge faced both by the established and emerging democracies across the world"", he pointed out. ECI accordingly has made elaborate arrangements for effective implementation of Election Expenditure Monitoring mechanism. Deployment of General, Police and Expenditure Observers as also Micro observers, to keep a watchful eye on the mammoth electoral process ensures the sanctity and purity of electoral process, he informed the Delegates.

Senior officials of the Election Commission made comprehensive presentations to apprise the foreign delegates on the role and responsibilities of the Election Commission of India and various challenges in planning and organizing elections in the world’s largest democracy. Presentations regarding political party registrations; Election Commission’s advance training & research wing- India International Institute of Democracy & Election Management (IIIDEM); preparation of Electoral Rolls and IT initiatives; Electoral Voting Machines and VVPATs; briefing on Media and Social Media Interaction; Election laws and related matters were made. 

Second issue of ECI's quarterly magazine ""My Vote Matters"" was also released on this occasion by the Commission. The Magazine presents a comprehensive glimpse of preparatory initiatives in different States for the ongoing elections. First issue of this magazine was presented by Chief Election Commissioner Sh Sunil Arora to the Hon'ble President of India Sh Ram Nath Kovind on the National Voters' Day 25th January 2019.



Welcoming the Delegates, Shri Umesh Sinha, Sr. Deputy Election Commissioner underscored that these visits provide a good opportunity for sharing of experiences and an exchange of best practices among the Election Management Bodies. He also gave an overview of the election planning, security management and the initiatives taken by the Commission under its flagship programme SVEEP for voter education and awareness. He said that today all EMBs across the World need to learn from the experiences of each other to meet new challenges.

The conduct of elections in India is an exercise gigantic in scale and complexity. On May 11, 2019 the eve of elections to the sixth phase, the delegates visited South Delhi, East Delhi, Chandnichowk, West Delhi and Gurgaon Parliamentary constituencies to get a glimpse of the poll preparedness activities, dispatch of polling parties and the massive logistic arrangements put in place to ensure a free, fair and festive elections.

On May 12, 2019 they witnessed conduct of mock poll early in the morning at various polling stations at Dwarka. They interacted with the polling officials and understood the procedures and processes that make our elections so credible and transparent. 

The delegates visited various polling stations in North West Delhi, East Delhi, Chandni Chowk. South Delhi and Gurgaon through the day to see the polling-in –action and the festive air that surrounds polling. They visited some polling stations which are managed entirely by women polling staff as also some model polling stations with the best of facilities for the voters. The delegates also interacted with the Chief electoral officer of Delhi to get the perspective on elections from the state level. They also visited the Election Museum at CEO office Delhi .The close of polling and the protocols that accompany the sealing of the machines was another aspect that the delegates will be exposed to during the day.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved  a new Central Sector Scheme, a historic decision that will empower farmers across India. This is a path breaking scheme that will provide pension cover to our industrious farmers who toil day and night to keep our nation fed. It is also for the first time since independence that such a pension coverage has been envisioned for farmers.

It is estimated that 5 crore small and marginal farmers will benefit in the first three years itself.  The Central Government would spend Rs. 10774.50 crore for a period of 3 years towards its contribution (matching share) for providing social security cover as envisaged under the scheme.

The salient features of this scheme are:

A voluntary and contributory pension scheme for all Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) across the country.

Entry age of 18 to 40 years with a provision of minimum fixed pension of Rs.3,000/- on attaining the age of 60 years. 

For example, a beneficiary farmer is required to contribute Rs 100/ - per month at median entry age of 29 years.  The Central Government shall also contribute to the Pension Fund an equal amount as contributed by the eligible farmer.  

After the subscriber’s death, while receiving pension, the spouse of the SMF beneficiary shall be entitled to receive 50% of the pension received by the beneficiary as family pension, provided he/she is not already an SMF beneficiary of the Scheme.  If, the death of the subscriber happens during the period of contribution, the spouse shall have the option of continuing the Scheme by paying regular contribution. 

Synergy between schemes, prosperity for farmers:

An interesting feature of the Scheme is that the farmers can opt to allow his/her monthly contribution to the Scheme to be made from the benefits drawn from the Pradhan Mantri KisanSAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme directly. Alternatively, a farmer can pay his monthly contribution by registering through Common Service Centres (CSCs) under MeitY.  

Fulfilling core promises, empowering the agriculture sector:

For seventy years after Independence, such a coverage for farmers was never thought. It was in the run up to the 2019 Parliamentary elections that PM Narendra Modi first mooted such an idea, which gradually found resonance across the length and breadth of India. Such a plan was mentioned in the BJP manifesto and in the first Cabinet meeting after the formation of a new Government, it has become a reality.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved that the ambit of the Pradhan Mantri KisanSamman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) would be comprehensively extended. With this decision, all land holding eligible farmer families (subject to the prevalent exclusion criteria) would avail of the benefits under this scheme. 

More beneficiaries, greater progress:

The revised Scheme is expected to cover around 2 crore more farmers, increasing the coverage of PM-KISAN to around 14.5 crore beneficiaries, with an estimated expenditure by Central Government of Rs. 87,217.50 crores for year 2019-20.  

Speed, scale and a major promise delivered: 

Today’s Cabinet decision pertaining to expanding the ambit PM-KISAN marks the fulfilment of a major promise made by the Prime Minister to the people of India in the run-up to the 2019 Parliamentary elections. The BJP manifesto too mentioned this major policy decision. 

It may also be noted that certain operational issues like lack of updated land records in Jharkhand and lack of Aadhaar penetration in states of Assam, Meghalaya and J&K have also been resolved.

PM-KISAN: A path-breaking support incentive for farmers:

The genesis of the PM-KISAN Yojana dates back to the interim Budget for the year 2019-2020. 

The key element of PM-KISAN is income support of Rs. 6000/- to the small and marginal landholder farmer families with cultivable land holding upto 2 hectare across the country. (This has been expanded today)

The amount is being released in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs.2000/- each over the year, to be credited into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries held in destination banks through Direct Benefit Transfer mode. 

The scheme was launched in a record time of 3 weeks, on 24th February at a huge programme in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh where the first rounds of instalments was paid to several farmers.

So far, 1st instalment to 3.11 crore beneficiaries and 2nd instalment to 2.66 crore beneficiaries have been credited directly to the bank accounts of the farmer families.

Serving India’s Annadatas with renewed vigour:

Time and again, PM Narendra Modi has spoken with great reverence for India’s farmers. He has described India’s farmers as our Annadatas who undertake great efforts to feed 1.3 billion Indians.

Between 2014 to 2019, numerous measures were taken to empower the hardworking farmer. This includes increase in the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 22 crops, Soil Health Cards, PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana, PM KisanSampada Yojana, e-NAM for better markets and more. These steps have made agriculture more prosperous and ensured greater productivity for farmers. They will go a long way in fulfilling the Prime Minister’s dream of doubling farmer incomes by 2022, when India marks 75 years of freedom.

                During the Union Cabinet Meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, the first since the outcome of the 2019 Lok Sabha election, a novel initiative was cleared that will benefit crores of farmers and improve the health of animals. 

This initiative pertains to controlling Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis to support the livestock rearing farmers. The Cabinet had cleared a total outlay of Rs. 13,343 crores to fully control these diseases amongst the livestock in the country in the next five years and subsequently eradicate these diseases.  

This decision indicates the spirit of compassion towards those animals who are a valued part of our planet but are not able to speak. 

The threat of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis:

These diseases are very common amongst the livestock – cow-bulls, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs etc. 

If a cow/buffalo gets infected with FMD, the milk loss is upto 100% which could last for four to six months. Further, in case of Brucellosis the milk output reduces by 30%, during the entire life cycle of animal. Brucellosis also causes infertility amongst the animals. The infection of brucellosis can also be transmitted to the farm workers and livestock owners. Both the diseases have a direct negative impact on the trade of milk and other livestock products. 

The decision of the Cabinet today fulfils the major promise made in the manifesto as it provides much relief to crores of farmers in the country who rear livestock.

Care and compassion for animals:

          In case of FMD, the scheme envisages vaccination coverage to 30 crore bovines (cows-bulls and buffaloes) and 20 crore sheep/goat and 1 crore pigs at six months’ interval along with primary vaccination in bovine calves, while the Brucellosis control programme shall extend to cover 100% vaccination coverage of 3.6 crore female calves.  

          The programme so far has been implemented on cost sharing basis between the Central and State Governments. In a rare instance of departure, the Central Government has decided to now bear the entire cost of the programme to ensure complete eradication of these diseases and better livelihood opportunities for all the livestock rearing farmers in the country.

	We, the Ministers and high-level officials from Arab Republic of Egypt, Barbados, Central African Republic, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Jamaica, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, People's Republic of Bangladesh, People's Republic of China, Republic of Benin, Republic of Chad, Republic of India, Republic of Indonesia, Republic of Malawi, Republic of South Africa, Republic of Uganda and Sultanate of Oman met in New Delhi, on 13 and 14 May 2019, to discuss recent developments at the WTO and explore ways for working with all Members to strengthen the multilateral trading system.  


 


	We reaffirm the pre-eminence of the WTO as the global forum for trade rules setting and governance. We note with concern the multiple challenges confronting the rules-based multilateral trading system and agree to work together with all WTO Members to strengthen the WTO, make it more effective and continue to remain relevant to the diverse needs of its Members, in line with objectives of the WTO. 


 


	We re-affirm that the dispute settlement system of the WTO is a central element in providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system. This has proved to be more effective and reliable as compared to its predecessor, GATT. We note with concern that Members have failed to arrive at a consensus in the selection process to fill vacancies in the Appellate Body. This ongoing impasse has weakened the dispute settlement system and threatens to completely paralyze it by December 2019. We, therefore, urge all WTO Members to engage constructively to address this challenge without any delay in filling the vacancies in the Appellate Body, while continuing discussions on other issues relating to the functioning of the dispute settlement mechanism. 


 


	An inclusive multilateral trading system based on equality and mutual respect should ensure that all WTO Members abide by WTO rules and abjure any form of protectionism. The core value and basic principles of the multilateral trading system must be preserved and strengthened, particularly with a view to building trust among Members. To this end, we urge WTO Members to adopt measures that are compatible with WTO rules to avoid putting the multilateral trading system at risk. 


 


	Multilateral avenues, based on consensus, remain the most effective means to achieve inclusive development-oriented outcomes. Members may need to explore different options to address the challenges of contemporary trade realities in a balanced manner. We note that in the post-MC 11 phase, many Members have evinced interest in pursuing outcomes in some areas through joint initiatives approach. The outcomes of these initiatives should be conducive to strengthening the multilateral trading system and be consistent with WTO rules.


 


	We recall that international trade is not an end in itself but a means of contributing to certain objectives, including raising standards of living. Special and Differential Treatment is one of the main defining features of the multilateral trading system and is essential to integrating developing Members into global trade. Special and Differential Treatment provisions are rights of developing Members that must be preserved and strengthened in both current and future WTO agreements, with priority attention to outstanding LDC issues.
	We stress the importance of technical assistance and capacity building provided to developing Members, in particular LDCs, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework, Aid for Trade and other tools. We urge Members to continue doing so.


 


	The process of WTO reform must keep development at its core, promote inclusive growth, and fully take into account the interests and concerns of developing Members, including the specific challenges of graduating LDCs. The way forward must be decided through a process that is open, transparent and inclusive. We agree to work collectively with the aim to develop proposals to ensure that our common interests are reflected in the WTO reform process. 


 


	WTO rules seek to foster an open and non-discriminatory trade regime. In order to instill confidence among the Members, it is imperative that the Ministerial Conferences of the WTO are organized in a more open, transparent and inclusive manner. WTO notification obligations must consider the capacity constraints and implementation related challenges faced by many developing Members, particularly LDCs. In the WTO, a more cooperative and gradual approach is the best way in dealing with the issue of transparency, where many developing Members struggle to comply with their notification obligations.


 


	Some WTO agreements, for example the Agreement on Agriculture, contain imbalances and inequities that prejudice the trade and development interests of developing Members. There is a need to provide adequate policy space to the developing Members to support their farmers through correcting the asymmetries and imbalances in this Agreement on priority. This should be undertaken on the basis of work done and progress already made in the past, and provide further flexibilities to the LDCs and Net Food Importing Developing Countries. It is really time that cotton receives concrete and appropriate responses it deserves. 


 


	We agree to consult on various issues of common interest to developing Members, including comprehensive and effective disciplines on fisheries subsidies with appropriate and effective Special & Differential Treatment provisions for developing Members. 


 


	We urge WTO Members to expedite the process of accession of new Members.


 


	We reiterate our commitment to work towards strengthening WTO by promoting development and inclusivity for the benefit of all Members.

The WTO Ministerial Meeting of Developing Countries concluded in New Delhi today. The Ministerial Meeting began last evening with a dinner hosted by the Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu. The Director General of WTO, Roberto Azevedo, was also present during the dinner. 

In his address at the dinner, Suresh Prabhu, said that the New Delhi Meeting is taking place at a time when trade tensions show no signs of abating and protectionist tendencies are on the rise which makes it very essential to collectively debate and discuss the way forward in a multilateral framework. 

Commerce Minister added that the New Delhi Ministerial Meeting is an initiative by India to facilitate a free and frank exchange of views on all issues of common interest, particularly of the Developing Countries and will explore how to collectively address the challenges emerging from suggestions on WTO reform.  

In his address at the dinner last night, DG, WTO, Roberto Azevedo, said that the reform process will mitigate the current crisis at WTO and talk about destroying the existing system is not the correct way and may not have the desired outcome. DG, WTO suggested for working in the existing system. 

He further said that the Dispute Settlement crisis is a deep crisis and all countries have to look for a resolution. Business as usual approach is not an option anymore and all members should work for a solution. 

Roberto Azevedo said that plurilaterals should not be seen as a division between Developed and Developing Countries as they contain members from both sides. He further said that the Special and Differential Treatment Mechanism must be innovative in order to address the impasse. If left unaddressed it may go either way, he said. The ideal way is to have a bench mark because the differentiation is already happening and is essential for small Developing Countries. DG, WTO further added that the best way forward is to have a trade-facilitation-agreement-type model where countries may set their own benchmarks. 

In the inaugural session of the Ministerial Meeting, today morning, Suresh Prabhu said that there are 7.3 billion people living in Developing Countries and they cannot and should not be deprived of the benefits of growth and WTO is an institution which addresses these concerns of development and growth of countries through trade and not aid. The Commerce Minister added that he is certain that the efforts of the New Delhi Ministerial Meeting will definitely lead to a WTO which is better than what it is today. 

The Multilateral Trading System is the collective responsibility of all countries who have a stake in it.  It is the duty of countries to successfully address conflicting interests, motives and ideologies, in order to preserve and strengthen this valuable institution, the Minister added. The principles of non-discrimination, predictability, transparency, the tradition of decision-making by consensus and, most importantly, the commitment to development, underlying the multilateral trading system, are too valuable to lose, he said.

The approach of the New Delhi Ministerial Meeting is to re-energise and strengthen multilateralism and put in place a more inclusive decision - making process. Towards this end, it is essential that the collective view of as many Developing Countries as possible is formally articulated in submissions on WTO reforms.

A year ago, on 19-20 March 2018, India had organised an Informal WTO Ministerial Gathering, in which more than 50 Members – both developed and developing- had participated. In the March 2018 Gathering in New Delhi it was emphasized that there is a need to preserve and enhance the functioning and credibility of the rules-based Multilateral Trading System as embodied in the WTO.

Commerce Minister hoped that the New Delhi Ministerial Meeting will re-endorse the centrality of development in WTO negotiations and provide suggestions for WTO reforms with development at its core.

Senior officials of participating countries at the inaugural session of the WTO Ministerial Meeting

 

Commerce Secretary, Dr.AnupWadhawan, welcomed senior officials of participating delegations from Developing and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) who are meeting in New Delhi over two days to discuss key issues and challenges facing the multi-lateral trading system.

Speaking at the inaugural session, Commerce Secretary said that the existential challenges to the multilateral rules based trading system are manifestina spate of unilateral measures and counter measures, deadlock in key areas of negotiations and the impasse in the Appellate Body.  The logjam in the Appellate Body is a serious threat to the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO and the implementation function of the Organization. The fundamentals of the system are being tested through a tide of protectionism around the worldvitiating the global economic environment.  The situation does not bode well for developing countries, including the LDCs. 

The harm that the institutional failure due to the collapse of the Appellate Body will cause will be felt more in Developing Countries including LDCs who needthe protection of the rules based system more than developed countries. There is an urgent need to engage constructively to preserve the system and come up with constructive solutions to the problem.

The situation in the WTO has spurred a strong discourse for reforming the WTO, which unfortunately is characterised by a complete lack of balance.  The reform agendabeing promoted does not address the concerns of the developing countries.  The discussions in the meeting being held in New Delhi give a chance to reaffirm the resolve to keep development at the centre of the reform agenda.   The reform initiatives must promote inclusiveness and non-discrimination, build trust and address the inequalities and glaring asymmetries in existing agreements. These asymmetries are against the interest of developing countries including LDCs. There is a need to work together to put issues of importance for developing countries and their priorities in the reform agenda.

There has been no active engagement or movement on key issues of concerns for developing countries including LDCs in the negotiating agenda. Agriculture remains a key priority for a large membership of WTO representing the developing world. However, there is a strong push to completely relegate existing mandates and decisions and work done for the past many years, to the background.

Discipline on fisheries subsidies are currently under negotiation at the WTO with intense engagement to understand the issues and work out a meaningful agreement by December 2019. The MC11 decision on fisheries subsidies clearly mandates that there should be an appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing countries. It is important for developing countries including LDCs to collectively work for a fair and equitable agreement on disciplines in fisheries subsidies, which takes into consideration the livelihood needs of subsistence fishermen and ground realities in our countries, and protects our policy space to develop capacities for harnessing our marine resources. 

India believes that developing countries need to work together to protect their interests in the WTO negotiations through preservation of the core fundamental principles of the WTO. The two-day meet gives an opportunity to the participating countries of developing a shared WTO reform proposal on issues of priority and interest for developing countries. This will help in building a common narrative on issues of importance for Developing Countries including LDCs.

In two-day meeting following issues are likely to be discussed:


	Finding a solution to the ongoing impasse in the Appellate Body on an urgent basis.
	Issues of importance and priority for developing countries including LDCs in the reform agenda.
	How to reinvigorate negotiating agenda on issues of critical importance for developing countries?
	How to ensure effective S&D for all developing countries including LDCs?


Today’s senior officials’discussions will feed into the Ministers’ deliberations tomorrow,on 14th May 2019.

Thetwo-day meeting is an effective move by developing countries to positively influence the outcome of WTO reforms by making development at its core and exploring all means of saving multilateralism.

                The Commerce Ministry and Indian High Commissions and Embassies of eleven African countries arranged an interaction over Digital Video Conference (DVC) over two days, on 3rd and 6th May 2019, with the Indian business community in Africa. The interactions with Indian Diaspora were held in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, and Mauritius, Nigeria, Mozambique, Ghana, South Africa, Botswana, and Madagascar. This initiative was held in order to build an effective engagement withthe Indian Diaspora in Africain order to further deepen and strengthen India-Africa trade ties. 

The DVC was attended by over 400 members of Indian business community in 11 African countries.

India’s total trade with the African region during 2017-18 was USD 62.69 billion (8.15% of India’s total trade with the World). India’s share of exports to African countries as a percentage of India’s total exports to the world was of the order of 8.21% in 2017-18.  Africa region’s share in India’s total imports from the World accounted for 8.12% in 2017-18. 

Today, African countries present immense opportunities for India with the world’s largest land mass, 54 countries, a population growing to be almost equivalent to that of India, huge mineral resources, oil wealth, a youthful population, falling poverty levels and increasing consumption patterns. 

Thus, Africa has a huge demand for new business models for market entry, stable market access, entrepreneurship and investments in transport, telecom, tourism, financial services, real estate and construction.  

This initiative of the Commerce Ministry emphasizes the need for a multipronged strategy for further enhancing trade and investment ties between the two regions. Commerce Ministry recognizes that for formulating an effective export strategy it is imperative to engage the Indian business community in Africa for mutual gain for both sides as trade relations between the people of same origin instill greater confidence amongst trade partners. 

The Indian community in Africa is playing a vital role in all fields like politics, business and education.As per the latest available estimatesthe current strength of the Indian Diaspora in the African countries is 2.8 million out of those 2.5 million are PIOs and rest 220967 are NRIs.Total overseas Indians are 30.83 million of which 17.83 million are PIOs and 13 million are NRIs. (Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs, 2016). Indian Diaspora in Africa constitutes 9.11% of the total Diaspora of India. 

The inherent strength of India in Africa is its rich and vast Diaspora which has established strong links with the political, economic and social fabric of the African continent. In order to formulate astrategy to boost India-Africa Trade & Investment, the Indian Diaspora in Africa has to be leveraged furtherin order to ensure that the strategy is effective. Suggestionswere sought from the India business community. 

The major issues highlighted by the Indian Business Community in these 11 countries are:


	Improving the Line of Credit system and developing a facility for an affordable and competitive funding.
	Setting up of Indian Banks/financial institutions in Africa 
	Enhanced Buyers’ Credit facility for promotion of trade between the two regions
	Reviewing and liberalizing visa policies from both sides  
	Need for direct flights between the India and African countries 
	Exploring the possibility of rupee trade to address the issue of shortage of dollars in region. 
	Creation of common database of buyer-suppliers in the two regions for facilitating matchmaking for enhancement of bilateral trade. 
	Development of a robust trade dispute settlement mechanism  
	More frequent and structured country/sector specific trade exhibitions in Africa 
	Establishment of country chapters of FICCI or CII in Africa 
	Frequent visits of policy makers, chamber of commerce and investors for familiarization with local business and investment regime for informed decisions 


 

Department of Commerce welcomed the suggestions of the Indian business community and assured them that these suggestions will be shared with relevant stakeholders /Departments in order to incorporate the suggestions in the India-Africa strategy for trade promotion. 

Senior officers from Department of Commerce and Ministry of External Affairs were present during the interactions.

                A high level team of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials led by DG ASI, Smt. Usha Sharma is on a visit to Odisha to assess the nature and quantum of damage caused by cyclone Fani to Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri and Sun Temple, Konark.

 

The team visited the Konark in forenoon on 10th May 2019. The team observed that by and large there is no structural damage to the Monument. The team has informed that there is some dislocation in the scaffolding provided for chemical cleaning at upper level which is being set right. More than 200 trees have been damaged which are being cleared. The electric and illumination system including internet access has gone out of order, restoration of which will take some time. The monument will be opened to public in next 2-3 days. The chemical cleaning and consolidation of eastern face will be completed on priority. The monument will be restored back to normal within about a fortnight.

 

The team is now in the process of visiting Sri Jagannath Puri Temple to assess the damage. The state government had sought help from the ASI to assess the damage caused to these world heritage monuments. The team will also suggest restoration exercise needed for the monuments and the surrounding areas. 

 

Earlier, the Superintending Archaeologist, Bhubaneswar Circle ASI had inspected Monuments including Shree Jagannath Temple at Puri. He found certain damages on the Surface but no major damage to the structure of the temple.

                 A solemn ceremony was organized in Prato, near Florence in Italy on 29 May 2019 to commemorate the sacrifice made by two Indian soldiers – Hari Singh and Palu Ram of the Indian Army during World War II. 

 

The contribution of Indian soldiers in the liberation of Italy during the Second World War is well known. Almost 50,000 Indian troops, mostly between the ages of 19 to 22, fought for the ‘Liberation of Italy’. The first Indian troops were landed at Taranto in the south of Naples on 19 Sep 1943. From then until 29 Apr 1945, they were engaged in a heroic mission. 5,782 made the supreme sacrifice during the Italian campaign. It is creditable that out of 20 Victoria Crosses awarded during this campaign, Indians received six Victoria Crosses. The story of their bravery and their sacrifice is still talked about in Italian cities and villages that they helped to liberate. The Indian Soldiers lie in cemeteries all over Italy, in particular Sangro, Cassino, Arezzo, Forli and Rimini. The heroism of the Indian soldiers was visible in the battle to take Monte Cassino, battle for Sangro river and Liri Valley, the advance along the east coast to Bologna, crossing of Senio river and the battle of Gothic lines. 

 

In the present case, human bones were found near Florence in 1996 from Indian area of the battlefield at Poggio Alto near Montale (Florence). The remains were exhumed and investigated by team of doctors. Based on the date of death, location of the remains, anthropometric and morphological examination, findings on boots worn and ammunition used, the researchers matched the Commonwealth records of missing soldiers to ascribe the remains to those of Hari Singh and Palu Ram of 4/13 FRONTIER FORCE RIFLES.

 

Service documents of both the individuals were found in the Army Records held with the National Archives of India. Based on details of heights provided, the correct identification of the two corpses could be carried out successfully and now the remains of the soldiers have been duly cremated. 

 

The ceremony for presentation of urns was organized on 29 May 2019 at Public Assistance, Prato (Florence). In addition to a sizeable presence from the community of Prato and the Italian Armed Forces, the ceremony was attended by the Mayor, President of Public Assistance and Prefect of Prato. Representatives of Common Wealth War Graves Commission, Red Cross Society and host of other dignitaries of Prato also attended the ceremony. The Indian side was represented by Smt Reenat Sandhu, the Ambassador of India and Colonel Rohit Teotia, the Defence Attache to Italy. 16 senior officers attending the National Defence College Course in India and on a study tour to Italy also represented India and attended the ceremony. The ceremony was conducted as per appropriate military honours after which urns containing the ashes of the individuals were handed over by the Italian authorities to the Indian side, who further handed over the same to the custody of the Common Wealth War Graves Commission. Ashes of these two soldiers will be scattered on 16 Jul 2019, in the Forli war cemetery where the other comrades from that battlefield have also been commemorated.

                Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, Chief of the Naval Staff will relinquish command of the Indian Navy as the 23rd CNS on completion of his tenure and retirement from service on 31 May 2019, after over four decades of distinguished service.

An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla, Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, College of Defence Management, Secunderabad and Royal College of Defence Studies, London, the Admiral’s career has been enriched with vast experience at sea as well as in operational, training and tri-services appointments. Prior to being elevated to the Flag rank, Admiral Lanba was deeply engaged with professional training, shaping future leadership and skilling of the officers of the Indian Armed Forces.

On elevation to the Flag rank, Admiral Lanba held several significant assignments in the Navy including Chief of Staff, Southern Naval Command, Flag Officer Sea Training and Flag Officer Commanding Maharashtra and Gujarat Naval Area. On promotion to the rank of Vice Admiral, he was the Chief of Staff, Eastern Naval Command, Commandant, National Defence College and the Vice Chief of the Naval Staff. Prior to taking over as Chief of the Naval Staff on 31 May 2016, Admiral Lanba was the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Southern and Western Naval Commands. He took over as the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee on 01 January 2017.



During his tenure as the CNS, Admiral Lanba set the tone for several transitions in operational, training and organisational philosophy of the Indian Navy. The Mission Based Deployments introduced in June 2017 transformed the operational philosophy to deploying mission-ready ships and aircraft along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points. These deployed ships are always ready to meet any eventuality across the spectrum of operations ranging from acts of maritime terrorism and piracy to HADR. The Mission Based Deployments enabled Indian Naval units to be the first responder in crisis situations and showcased Indian Navy as the main instrument in India becoming a Net Security Provider in the Indian Ocean Region.

Admiral Lanba has also steered implementation of the new transition cycle which facilitated improvement of the overall readiness of ships and submarines in undertaking operational tasking and Mission Based Deployments. This transition saw considerable improvement in combat efficiency and crew proficiency of ships, resulting in overall improvement of Op Logistics, spares management and forecasting refit planning and expenditure management.

The Admiral’s tenure saw Indian Navy’s Foreign Cooperation initiatives becoming a ‘key driver’ to propel ‘India’s Defence Diplomacy’ to greater heights in the Indo-Pacific. Accordingly, as part of IN’s Capacity Building initiatives, the IN facilitated provision of a record number of naval assets to various IOR littorals and has also established itself as the preferred destination for niche training in the field of submarine, aviation and asymmetric warfare.

The IN also initiated forums for meaningful interactions at various levels; this includes the Sea-Rider programme for Junior Officers, Exercise SAMBANDH and Regional Maritime Security Course for mid-level Officers, and Goa Maritime Conclave for Chiefs of Navy, all of which have elevated our Foreign Cooperation engagements with our Friendly Foreign Countries.

His tenure has seen the reinvigoration of our multilateral engagements, in that we celebrated the 10th Anniversary of the IONS construct, took over as co-Chair for the IONS Working Group on Information Sharing and Interoperability, ratified the ‘IONS Guidelines for HADR’, conducted the first MILAN Exercise at Sea off Port Blair in Mar 2018 and also concluded several Operational and Logistics agreements with Friendly Foreign Countries.

Under his command, the Indian Navy examined and put into place a series of measures under the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government and also recommended ways to further indigenize defence procurements in order to overcome major challenges being faced therein. 49 ships and submarines are currently under construction in Indian shipyards, including the first indigenous aircraft carrier ‘Vikrant’. The ‘Indian Naval Indigenisation Plan 2015-30’ lays down the Navy’s plans for the next fifteen years which allows for Industry to formulate strategies to meet the requirements of the Navy through the new Strategic Partnership Model, notified in May 2017, as well as domestic R&D. These initiatives are aimed at enhancing indigenous defence industrial capability extending up to the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises.

In consonance with the Government’s digital vision, the Admiral’s tenure saw the launch of a new Digital Library available pan-Navy for knowledge management and retrieval including archiving of critical data and information. This was complemented by security and hardening of naval data networks in keeping with contemporary cyber security practices. In keeping with the Navy’s ethos of harnessing niche technologies, concrete plans to incorporate Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence into the Navy’s operational functioning have also been formulated.

The Admiral’s tenure also saw the Navy undertake ‘Functional Re-Organisation of Indian Navy towards improving Operational Efficiency’ and ‘Optimal Manning’. Towards this a strategy aimed at enhancing administrative efficiency in the Navy and achieving Optimal Administrative support, as the desired end state was promulgated in April 2019. Under this, the need for greater empowerment of Base Depot Ships has been envisaged which would greatly improve upon the Vital, Essential and Desirable elements of Administration in the Navy. These Administrative reforms and transformation intend to bring visible improvement in the quality of life and enhance satisfaction levels of personnel which would act an enabler for developing motivated and committed teams. This is a reinforcement of the tenet that ‘human resource measures and sound administration’ have been, and will always be, amongst the key enablers of Operational Effectiveness.

 

Mrs Reena Lanba has been at the helm of the Navy Wives Welfare Association since 31 May 2016. Her untiring efforts towards women empowerment and welfare were evident with the successful collaboration of NWWA with reputed institutes like Tata Institute of Social Sciences and INLINGUA. Under her able guidance 'PrepMantra App', an online platform for study material and exam preparation, was launched for all naval personnel and their dependents. With the aim to increase awareness amongst NWWA members on child care and importance of becoming self-reliant 'Swayam Siddha' lecture series and contest were conducted pan Navy. Women health being the prime objective, Mrs Reena Lanba introduced 'Well Women Clinic' for annual medical checkup for NWWA members. Keeping the essence of NWWA, members were provided an opportunity to specialise in different products such as natural fabrics while working in Udyogika and Tarsh units. In collaboration with Naval Education Society, many initiatives were taken to improve quality of education for students of Navy Children Schools at all stations across India. In shaping a new vision for NWWA she was the inspiration behind designing the NWWA Logo depicting the ethos of the organisation, creation of the NWWA song, initiation of the YOLO (you only live once) event to provide a forum for young and old to informally celebrate naval social fabric, connecting the pan Indian NWWA organisation through social media – Telegram, publication of a NWWA coffee table book, policy formulation initiatives for streamlining the organisation, starting orientation capsules for newly wed NWWA members, emphasis on yoga and meditation and many more such initiatives that have propelled the organisation to greater heights and contributed silently to a happy navy family. As a befitting tribute to her able leadership and tutelage, NWWA was awarded the prestigious 4th Women Astitva Samman.

 

All hands of the Indian Navy wish Admiral Sunil Lanba and Mrs Reena Lanba Godspeed and a very happy retired life.

5. The glittering ceremony culminated with the successful trainees  forming up in two columns and marching with their gleaming swords and rifles held in salute, past the Academy’s Saluting Dias, the Quarterdeck, in Slow March, to the traditional notes of ‘Auld Lang Syne’, the poignant farewell tune played by Armed Forces around the world when bidding adieu to colleagues and comrades. Passing out courses were bid farewell by a batch of three MiG 29-K fighter aircraft in Vic formation led by Cdr Viaksh Narwal, NM from Indian Naval Air Squadron 303 who carried out a low fly past over the quarterdeck welcoming the new officers to the Navy and joined the celebrations with a bomb burst manoeuvre.

6. On completion of the parade, the proud parents and guardians of the Passing Out courses shipped the Naval and Coast Guard epaulettes, known as ‘Stripes’, on the shoulders of their wards, thus symbolising their transformation from ‘cadets’ into full-fledged Navy and Coast Guard Officers. The Reviewing Officer and other dignitaries shipped the stripes of the medal winners and congratulated all the trainees for their successful completion of the rigorous training.  On completion of the training at the Indian Naval Academy, these officers will proceed to various Naval and Coast Guard ships and establishments to further consolidate their training in specialised fields.

                Today, IAF’s formidable workhorse, the Russian made AN-32 aircraft was formally fleet certified to fly on blended aviation fuel containing up to 10% of indigenous bio-jet fuel. The approval certificate was received at the aero-engine test facilities at Chandigarh by Air Commodore Sanjiv Ghuratia VSM, Air Officer Commanding, 3 BRD, AF on behalf of the IAF from Mr P Jayapal, Chief Executive CEMILAC.            

The IAF has undertaken a series of evaluation tests and trials with this green aviation fuel for the last one year. The scope of these checks was in consonance with the international aviation standards. Today’s approval is an acknowledgement of the meticulous testing using the indigenous bio-jet fuel by the IAF.

The indigenous bio-jet fuel was first produced by the CSIR-IIP lab at Dehradun in 2013, but could not be tested or certified for commercial use on aircraft due to lack of test facilities in the civil aviation sector. On 27 July, 2018, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa PVSM AVSM YSM VM ADC had formally announced IAF’s intention to permit the use of all its resources for testing and certifying the indigenous fuel. Since then, IAF’s flight test crew and engineers have been evaluating the performance of this fuel against international standards. This is a huge step in promoting the ‘Make in India’ mission as this bio-fuel would be produced from Tree Borne Oils (TBOs) sourced from tribal areas and farmers, augmenting their income substantially.

The Combat missile was test fired on a specially designed target chosen at a range of 270 Kms, thus validating deep penetration capability by the supersonic cruise missile and accurate engagement of targets in depth. 

The launch of the BrahMos missile involved coordination with large number of agencies for a successful and smooth conduct of firing. It was a cohesive effort of all three services demonstrating high standards of Inter Service Synergy. 

Lt Gen MM Naravane, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief  Eastern Command  witnessed the launch along with other officers  and congratulated the Unit and all agencies involved in the process, resulting in the successful launch of the Combat missile.

BrahMos missile has by now established itself as a major 'Force Multiplier' in modern day battlefield with impeccable multi role and multi platform launch capabilities furthering the confidence amongst our troops

                In an effort to enhance inter Armed Forces Cooperation and utilise each other’s assets for training and sports, the Director Generals of Assam Rifles and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) in an impressive ceremony held at Laitkor, Shillong, today signed an Affiliation Charter between 3rd (Naga Hills) Battalion of Assam Rifles and Indian Coast Guard Ship ‘Shaurya’.

Assam Rifles is the oldest Para Military Force of India with a rich history of valour, courage and tradition. Assam Rifles have 46 Battalions manning the Indo-Myanmar border and countering the insurgency in the north east states. On contrary the ICG, with 142 ships & 62 aircraft is one of the youngest Armed Force under Ministry of Defence.

3rd (Naga Hills) Battalion Assam Rifles is the oldest battalion of the force raised in 1835 as ‘The Cachar Levy’ comprising of 750 personnel of all ranks for guarding the Eastern Frontier of Assam from Brahmaputra river to the Cachar Hills. Presently, the battalion is developed at Kohima, Nagaland where it had earlier bravely fought the Japanese in World War-II and stopped their advance into India.

ICGShip ‘Shaurya’, indigenously built at Goa Shipyard Limited, based in Chennai is a modern state-of-the-art 105 mtrs long Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) commissioned on August12, 2017. ‘Shaurya’ meaning courage is a projection of ICG’s commitment ‘To Serve & Protect’ the maritime interest of the nation. The ship is extensively developed for EEZ surveillance and other duties as enshrined in the Coast Guard charter to safeguard the maritime interest of India.

The objective of the affiliation is to promote bilateral cooperation between the Assam Rifles and the ICG in the field of exchange of information/personnel, build-up camaraderie for training, sports/adventure and sustainable development. This affiliation will facilitate the ‘Sentinels of the North East’ to interact with the ‘Sentinels of the Seas’ on professional and social platforms and share rich experiences and best practices.

The twoArmed Forces will be greatly benefited by motivating one another towards common goals. Assam Rifles personnel will be able to understand the peculiarities of a Maritime Service (Indian Coast Guard) and their role in guarding and intercepting the anti-national forces/non state actors detrimental to the maritime/coastal security. Similarly, the personnel of ICG will be able to see and understand the operational ethos of the Assam Rifles working along theIndo-Myanmar border.

The reciprocation Ceremony will be held onboard Indian Coast Guard Ship ‘Shaurya’ at Chennai on 11 and 12 June 2019.

                Today, IAF successfully fired the BrahMos air version missile from its frontline Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft.  The launch from the aircraft was smooth and the missile followed the desired trajectory before directly hitting the land target. 

 

The air launched BrahMos missile is a 2.5 ton supersonic air to surface cruise missile with ranges of close to 300 km, designed and developed by BAPL. The IAF became the first Air Force in the world to have successfully fired an air launched 2.8 Mach surface attack missile of this category on a sea target on 22 Nov 17. Today’s was the second such live launch of the weapon. The integration of the weapon on the aircraft was a very complex process involving mechanical, electrical and software modifications on aircraft. The IAF has been involved in the activity from its inception. The software development of the aircraft was undertaken by the IAF engineers while HAL carried out mechanical and electrical modifications on the aircraft. The dedicated and synergetic efforts of the IAF, DRDO, BAPL and HAL have proven the capability of the nation to undertake such complex integrations. 

 

The firing could be successfully undertaken with dedicated support from Indian Navy by way of ensuring availability of a large number of monitoring ships to ensure range safety clearance.

 

The BrahMos missile provides Indian Air Force a much desired capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target at sea or on land with pinpoint accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions. The capability of the missile coupled with the superlative performance of the Su-30MKI aircraft gives the IAF the desired strategic reach.

                At about 2100hrs on 19 May 2019, intelligence was received of a suspicious vessel likely to be engaged in drug trafficking in area off Indo-Pak International Maritime Border Line (IMBL) off the Gujarat Coast. Similar inputs were also received from Directorate of Revenue Intelligence on 20 May 2019. 

Indian Coast Guard immediately swung into action and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) Ship Arinjay on patrol off Indo-Pak IMBL was alerted about the suspect vessel. Two additional Interceptor Boats C-437 and C-408 were also tasked from Jakhau and Okha to augment the search for the suspect vessel. ICG Dornier aircraft was also launched from Porbandar on 20 and 21 May 2019 for aerial recce in the area. 

Coast Guard Ships and aircraft maintained extensive search in the area for intercepting the suspect vessel.  ICG ships classified various contacts in the area and kept them under constant surveillance. During search one fishing boat was observed to be suspicious and Coast Guard ships in area shadowed the suspect vessel during the dark hours of 20 May 2019 night. 

The suspect vessel with first light on 21 May 19 crossed the IMBL towards Indian side and started moving towards the Jakhau coast. The suspect vessel Al Madina was kept under surveillance and intercepted at about 0915hrs on 21 May 2019 about 08 NM inside Indian waters off IMBL by ICG ship Arinjay.

During boarding the vessel was found to be a Pakistani Fishing Boat Al Madina registered at Karachi with 06 Pakistani crew. Initial search of the fishing boat by Indian Coast Guard boarding party revealed 194 packets of suspected narcotics substance. The vessel is being escorted to Jakhau harbour for detailed investigation and rummaging. 

Recently during a similar operation on 24 March 2019, ICG ship Rajratan in joint operation with ATS, Gujarat seized about 100 Kgs of heroin from a suspected Pakistani Dhow off the coast of Gujarat apprehending 09 Iranian crew of the vessel.   

Indian Coast Guard Director General Rajendra Singh said that the Coast Guard has been at the forefront in anti-narcotics and anti-smuggling operations and since inception has seized contraband worth of more than Rs. 5000 crores.

The Myanmar delegation led by Commodore Htein Win, Commander, Ayeyarwady Naval Command, called on Cmde Ashutosh Ridhorkar, VSM, Naval Component Commander on 20 May 19.

The CORPAT initiative between the two navies is meant to address issues of terrorism, illegal fishing, drug trafficking, human trafficking, poaching and other illegal activities inimical to interest of both nations. Started in Mar 2013, the CORPAT series has enhanced the mutual understanding and fostered improved professional interaction between the two navies for maritime interoperability.

            Myanmar ships UMS King TabinShweHtee and UMS Inlay would undertake a coordinated patrol with Indian Naval Ship Saryu from 20 – 28 May 19. The patrolling effort will be augmented by Maritime Patrol Aircraft from both the navies. The ships would patrol along the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) between the two countries covering a distance of approximately 725 Kms over a period of four days. The ships will also undertake joint manoeuvres and drills during the sea phase of coordinated patrol (CORPAT) prior ‘Closing Ceremony’ of the CORPAT onboard Myanmar Naval Ship..

                On successful completion of IMDEX 19, IN ships Kolkata and Shakti are continuing their stay at Singapore to participate in the annual Singapore India Maritime Bilateral Exercise SIMBEX-2019 scheduled from 16 May to 22 May 19. 

Since its inception in 1993, SIMBEX has grown in tactical and operational complexity. the annual bilateral exercise saw its progression from traditional anti-submarine exercises to more complex maritime exercises such as advanced air defence operations, anti air/ surface practice firings, tactical exercises, etc. Over the years SIMBEX has stood the test of time in demonstrating the nation’s commitment to enhance maritime cooperation between the two navies and bolster bonds of friendship between the two countries. For SIMBEX 19, the IN has deployed its finest assets for with an aim to strengthen mutual trust, enhance interoperability, and build greater synergy to address common maritime concerns among both navies.

The harbour phase of SIMBEX-19 conducted from 16 may to 18 may included various planning conferences, simulator based warfare training/ wargaming, courtesy calls to dignitaries of RSN navy, sporting events and deck reception onboard Kolkata. The sea phase of simbex 19 scheduled to be conducted in the South China Sea from 19 may to 22 may 19 will include various maritime combat exercises such as firing on aerial/ surface targets, advanced aerial tracking, coordinated targeting exercises and tactical exercises on surface/ air scenarios.

In addition to IN ships Kolkata and Shakti, long range maritime patrol aircraft Poseidon-8I (P8I) will also participate in simbex-19. The Singapore side will be represented by RSN ships Steadfast and Valiant, maritime patrol aircraft Fokker-50 (F-50) and F-16 fighter aircraft. 

SIMBEX 19 would also conclude the two month long deployment of IN ships Kolkata and Shakti to South and East China Seas which is aimed at extending the bridges of friendship through enhanced cultural, economic and maritime interactions with countries of east and south-east asia. IN ships’ participation in International Fleet Review (IFR) at Qingdao, China as part of PLA (Navy) 70th anniversary celebrations and ADMM-plus MS FTX also reflects the government of India’s ‘Act East’ policy and the Indian Navy’s efforts to “unite nations through the oceans”.

                            The Indian Navy achieved a significant milestone in enhancing its Anti Air Warfare Capability with the maiden cooperative engagement firing of the Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (MRSAM). The firing was undertaken on the Western Seaboard by Indian Naval Ships Kochi and Chennai wherein the missiles of both ships were controlled by one ship to intercept different aerial targets at extended ranges. The firing trial was carried out by the Indian Navy, DRDO and Israel Aerospace Industries.

            The successful conduct of the test has been the result of sustained efforts by all stakeholders over the years. DRDL Hyderabad, a DRDO Lab, has jointly developed this missile in collaboration with Israel Aerospace Industries. The MRSAM has been manufactured by Bharat Dynamics Limited, India.

            These Surface to Air Missiles are fitted onboard the Kolkata Class Destroyers and would also be fitted on all future major warships of the Indian Navy. With the successful proving of this cooperative mode of engagement, the Indian Navy has become a part of a select group of Navies that have this niche capability. This capability significantly enhances the combat effectiveness of the Indian Navy thereby providing an operational edge over potential adversaries.

                Admiral Sunil Lanba, the Chief of Naval Staff inaugurated Indian Navy’s first full-fledged Service Selection Board (SSB) today at Diamond Harbour, near Kolkata. The Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command, Vice Admiral Karambir Singh, was also present at the venue.

SSB (Kolkata) is located approximately 55 km away from central Kolkata, on land that was previously occupied by a Naval Coastal Battery. This is the fifth Service Selection Board of the Indian Navy and caters for selection of both Permanent and Short Service Commission officers. The other Boards are located in Bhopal, Bengaluru, Visakhapatnam and Coimbatore. Spread over an area of 27 acres on the banks of the river Hooghly, SSB (Kolkata) has the capacity to screen approximately 5000 officer-candidates annually. The Board can accommodate approximately 160 candidates at a time and has separate facilities and accommodation for men and women candidates. Facilities available at the Board are GTO ground, Testing Hall, Conference Room, accommodation for staff and a Medical Inspection Room. These are not only custom-built to meet the stringent testing requirements, but also to cater for the comfort and convenience of candidates.

The SSB at Diamond Harbour, Kolkata will boost the induction of officers, both men and women, into the Indian Navy. Its location will reduce the travel time and effort for candidates from Northern and North Eastern parts of the country.

                The Indian Navy is introducing computer-based examination for the selection of Direct Entry Officers after graduation. The first Indian Navy Entrance Test (Officers),   ie. INET (Officers), is scheduled in September 2019 in various centers across the country. INET (Officers) will be used for screening for Permanent Commission and Short Service Commission Officer candidates for all graduate entries other than those that are screened by UPSC or University Entry Scheme.

 

Currently, officer candidates are shortlisted for interviews by Services Selection Board (SSB) on the basis of marks scored in graduation (or post-graduation for certain entries). Henceforth, shortlisting for SSB will be taken on the basis of marks scored in INET (Officers).

 

Under the new process, only one advertisement will be published every six months and applicants will need to exercise their option for entries that they wish to be considered for, on the basis of their educational qualification. Details of entries, age and educational qualifications are available on www.joinindiannavy.gov.in. Candidates are advised to register once on the website to fill in their personal, communication and educational particulars, as well as upload their supporting documents. Doing this before the application submission window opens, is advisable in order to save time. Eligible candidates will receive automated email alerts when the application submission window opens.

 

INET (Officers) will have four sections, viz English, Reasoning and Numerical Ability, General Science and Mathematical Aptitude, and General Knowledge. Candidates will need to pass in each section to be considered for SSB call up. Candidates will be called up for SSB interview on the basis of performance in INET (Officers) and their entry preference. To be considered for final Merit List, candidates would need to qualify in SSB and subsequent Medical Examination. Merit List will be drawn up on the basis of marks scored in INET (Officers) and SSB marks. Selected candidates will undergo Basic Training at the Indian Naval Academy.

                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) conducted successful flight test of ABHYAS - High-speed Expendable Aerial Target (HEAT) from Interim Test Range, Chandipur in Odisha today. The flight test was tracked by various RADARS & Electro Optic Systems and proved its performance in fully autonomous way point navigation mode. 

The configuration of ABHYAS is designed on an in-line small gas turbine engine and uses indigenously developed MEMS based navigation system for its navigation and guidance. The performance of the system was as per simulations carried out and demonstrated the capability of ABHYAS to meet the mission requirement for a cost effective HEAT.

                Admiral John Michael Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations, US Navy, is on an official tour to India from 12 to 14 May 2019. His visit is intended to consolidate bilateral naval relations between India and USA and also to explore new avenues for naval cooperation.

 

Admiral John M Richardson had discussions with Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chairman COSC and Chief of the Naval Staff today. He also interacted with Defence Secretary, Vice Chief of the Army Staff, Chief of the Air Staff, Chief of the Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman COSC and the National Security Council Secretariat.

 

Indian Navy and US Navy interact regularly at bilateral and multilateral forums and participate in maritime exercises such as MALABAR and RIMPAC. Regular Subject Matter Expert exchange also takes place between both the navies to institutionalise interoperability in various fields. After being accorded Major Defence Partner status by USA in 2016, India – US ties have grown significantly in recent years. The inaugural Ministerial 2+2 Dialogue conducted in September 2018 also facilitated new avenues for defence cooperation between the two countries. 

 

Major issues discussed during the visit included operations and exercises, training interactions, information exchange, capacity building and capability enhancement.

                First AH-64E (I) - Apache Guardian helicopter was formally handed over to the Indian Air Force at Boeing production facility in Mesa, Arizona, USA on  10 May 19. Air Marshal AS Butola, represented the Indian Air Force and accepted the first Apache in a ceremony at Boeing production facility, representatives from US Government were also present.

            IAF had signed a contract with US Government and M/s Boeing Ltd in Sep 2015 for 22 Apache helicopters. The first batch of these helicopters is scheduled to be shipped to India by Jul this year. Selected aircrew and ground crew have undergone training at the training facilities at US Army base Fort Rucker, Alabama. These personnel will lead the operationalisation of the Apache fleet in the IAF.

            The addition of AH-64 E (I) helicopter is a significant step towards modernisation of Indian Air Force’s helicopter fleet. The helicopter has been customized to suit IAF’s future requirements and would have significant capability in mountainous terrain. The helicopter has the capability to carry out precision attacks at standoff ranges and operate in hostile airspace with threats from ground. The ability of these helicopters, to transmit and receive the battlefield picture, to and from the weapon systems through data networking makes it a lethal acquisition. These attack helicopters will provide significant edge in any future joint operations in support of land forces.

                An unknown aircraft entered Indian Air Space in North Gujarat Sector at 1515 hrs with its IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) ‘on’. The aircraft did not follow the authorized Air Traffic Services (ATS) route and was not responding to Radio calls from Indian controlling agencies. Since ATS routes in   the area were closed due to the current geopolitical situation, and the aircraft entered Indian Air Space from an unscheduled point, the Air Defence interceptor on operational readiness was scrambled and vectored towards the unknown aircraft for investigation. On visual contact, the aircraft was identified as Georgian An-12 flying at twenty seven thousand feet. The aircraft neither responded on international distress frequency nor to visual signals during interception. However, when challenged, the aircraft responded and informed that it was a non scheduled An-12 aircraft that had got airborne from Tbilisi (Georgia) for Delhi via Karachi. The aircraft was shadowed and forced to land at Jaipur for necessary investigation.

                INS Ranjit, a Rajput class destroyer  was decommissioned at a solemn yet grand ceremony at Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam culminating a glorious era on 06 May 19. The decommissioning ceremony was attended by officers and sailors of the commissioning crew as well as other who have been part of Ranjit’s voyage over the last 36 years. The Chief Guest for the Decommissioning ceremony was His Excellency Admiral Devendra Kumar Joshi PVSM AVSM YSM NM VSM ADC (Retd) Hon’ble Lieutenant Governor, Andaman & Nicobar Islands who was also a part of the commissioning crew. The Commissioning Ceremony was graced by 16 officers and 10 sailors from the commissioning crew and 23 erstwhile Commanding Officers. 

The ship commissioned on 15 September 1983 by Captain Vishnu Bhagwat in erstwhile USSR has rendered yeoman service to the nation for 36 years. The ship has been helmed by 27 commanding officers and  the last commanding officer, Captain Vikram C Mehra has been in command since 06 Jun 17. The ship since her commissioning has sailed for 2190 days covering a distance of over 7,43,000 nautical miles which is equivalent to navigating around the world 35 times and 3.5 times the distance from earth to moon.

The ship has been at the forefront of major naval operations and has the distinction of serving on both Eastern and Western seaboards. Apart from various naval operations like Op Talwar and various multinational exercises, the ship has also been a flag bearer of the Indian Navy`s benign role by participating in relief operations post Tsunami in 2004 and Hud-hud on 2014. In recognition of the service rendered by the ship to the nation, the ship was awarded Unit Citations by the Chief of Naval Staff in 2003-04 and in 2009-10. 

At the sunset on 06 May 19, the National Flag, Naval Ensign and Commissioning Pennant were lowered for one last time onboard, glorious era in the history of the Indian Navy came to a nostalgic end. Whilst the Ranjit era has come to an end in the Indian Navy, the spirit of Ranjit will continue to live in the hearts of every officer and sailor who has served onboard and her motto of Sada Rane Jayat or Ever Victorious in Battle will continue to inspire generations of Sea Warriors today and in the future.

                Vela, the fourth Scorpene class submarine being constructed by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited for the Indian Navy, was launched today, on 06 May 2019, by Mrs Veena Ajay Kumar, wife of Dr Ajay Kumar, IAS, Secretary Defence Production, who was the Chief Guest on the occasion. VAdm AK Saxena, CWP&A was also present during the launching ceremony. This event reaffirms the steps taken by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd (MDL) in the ongoing ‘Make In India’ programme, which is being actively implemented by the Department of Defence Production (MoD).

The submarine was towed to Mumbai Port Trust, for separation from the pontoon, after which she will undergo rigorous trials and tests, both in harbour and at sea before delivery to the Indian Navy. 

The contract for the construction and Transfer-of-Technology for six Scorpene class submarines in series, has M/s Naval Group (formerly DCNS) of France as ‘Collaborator’ and are being built by MDL. 

Cmde Rakesh Anand, Chairman and Managing Director, MDL said on the occasion that with the launching of the P15 B Destroyer ‘Imphal’ on 20 April 2019 and the, launching of Vela on 06 May 2019, were indeed some of the major events for MDL so far this year.

Presently Eight Warships and five submarines are under construction at MDL. MDL is one of the India’s leading shipyards with a capacity to meet requirements of the Indian Navy. 

The Scorpene class of submarines can undertake multifarious tasks typically undertaken by any modern submarine which include anti-surface as well as anti-submarine warfare. The transfer of technology involves appropriate technical support by Naval Group to MDL in the field of construction, integration and tests of the submarines in India which is achieved through transfer of technical data package to MDL through information system as well as on job training to MDL’s personnel on critical technologies.

Leveraging the experience and the transfer-of-technology of the Scorpene project, with enhanced and upgraded infrastructure, MDL, is ready for undertaking construction of the future submarines.

                In order to provide succor to those in immediate need of assistance at most affected villages around Puri in the aftermath of extreme severe cyclone FANI, Indian Navy continues the Relief Operation with 3 ships using their integral helicopters.  The helicopters have been utilized for  airdropping food packets in areas which are inundated and inaccessible  by road.  In addition, Relief Camp and Community Kitchen at Pentakota village in Puri catering for 1000 personnel has been set up since 05 May 19. 5000 ltr potable water supplied to Chattragad village using water bowser from INS Chilka. Supply of another 5000 ltrs bottled water is being augmented from Visakhapatnam by road which is expected to reach the Relief camp site by midnight today. 

Based on a request from the Temple Administration, a Naval Diving Team from  INS Chilka undertook diving operations to clear off sand, plastic, other organic matter accumulated alongside the Kalijai floating Jetty, and carried out underwater assessment of the Jetty for safe operations on 05 May 19. The two-hour long  activity was undertaken by a team of 06 Divers with the specialised equipment. The floating Jetty used for ferry of tourist boats was affected by the impact of cyclone. High speed winds gusting over 100 kmph deposited large quantity of sand, plastic, other organic matter alongside Jetty which prohibited the ferrying of large boats with higher draughts alongside the Jetty, thus disrupting connectivity of the island with the Main land. 

In order to render medical assistance, Naval Medical Teams have set up  Medical Camps at four locations  at Chattraged and Jankia villages in Odisha. About 150 personnel have been provided medical assistance and medicines were distributed to those in need.  The medical team also sensitized the villages on preventive measures to avoid water-borne deceases and discussed other health related issues. The teams also assisted in distribution of food to the stranded villagers affected by the cyclone.

                In the aftermath of the devastation caused by Extremely Severe Cyclone ‘Fani’, the Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy has launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation effort in Odisha. Two Maritime Recce sorties were undertaken by the Dornier aircraft of the Navy revealing widespread destruction localised around the temple town of Puri. The Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command personally undertook aerial survey of the cyclone affected area with the first light on 04th May and visited INS Chilka to review the relief efforts. 

 

Based on the aerial surveys, the Eastern Naval Command is undertaking a three-pronged rescue and rehabilitation effort centred around Puri and its suburbs in coordination with the State Government and District Administration. Relief and rehabilitation ‘bricks’ and ‘pallets’ (Naval parlance for containerised relief stores) comprising food material, essential medical supplies, clothing items, disinfectants, repair material, chain saws for removing damaged trees, torches and batteries, etc. have been sent to INS Chilka, a naval establishment at Odisha, closest to Puri. The Naval Officer-in-Charge(Odisha) is centrally coordinating distribution of these relief materials and community kitchen is planned to be set up. 

 

Simultaneously, three Eastern Fleet ships are undertaking rescue and rehabilitation efforts from the Sea. The IN ships Ranvijay, Kadmatt and Airavat with three helicopters are presently operating off Puri and coordinating aerial survey and immediate response from Sea through their integral helicopters. As the first responders, helicopters from the ships have been able to provide immediate support. In order to coordinate the relief efforts, the Eastern Naval Command has pre-positioned Liaison teams in cyclone affected areas around Puri, who in turn are directing the rescue and relief efforts being undertaken by the ships. 

 

With the likely opening of the Bhubaneshwar airport today, Chetak and UH3H helicopters are being positioned there by the Navy to launch rescue efforts and air-dropping of relief material to the inaccessible and remote areas. The deployment of the helicopters at Bhubaneshwar would enable aerial rescue of stranded personnel to safer areas as well as access to areas without road connectivity. 

In order to sustain the rescue and relief over the next few days, the Eastern Naval Command has additional ships standby relief material.

                The first part of the Indo-French joint naval exercise, Varuna 19.1 will be conducted off the Goa coast from 1st to 10th May 19.

The upcoming 17th edition includes participation of the French Navy’s aircraft carrier FNS Charles de Gaulle, two destroyers, FNS Forbin and FNS Provence, the frigate FNS Latouche-Treville, the tanker FNS Marne and a nuclear submarine. From the Indian side, the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, destroyer INS Mumbai, the Teg-class frigate, INS Tarkash, the Shishumar- class submarine, INS Shankul, and the Deepak- class fleet tanker, INS Deepak, will be participating in this exercise.

The exercise will be conducted in two phases. The harbour phase at Goa would include cross-visits, professional interactions and discussions and sports events. The sea phase would comprise various excercises across the spectrum of maritime operations.

The second part, Varuna 19.2, is scheduled to be held at the end of May in Djibouti. The bilateral naval exercise initiated in 1983 and christened as ‘Varuna’ in 2001, form a vital part of the Indo-French strategic partnership. Having grown in scope and complexity over the years, this exercise exemplifies the strong relations between the two nations, in line with the Joint Strategic Vision of India-French Cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region signed by President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the former’s State visit to India in March 2018. The Varuna exercise aims at developing interoperability between the two navies and fostering mutual cooperation by learning from each other’s best practices to conduct joint operations. The exercise underscores the shared interests and commitment of both nations in promoting maritime security.

                The Reuters news agency has, earlier today, published a story titled “Modi proclaims a cleaner India, but the reality may be more murky”. In this story, it has raised questions around the progress made under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), specifically the findings of the recent National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey 2018-19. The National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey 2018-19 (NARSS) is the largest independent sanitation survey in the country carried out by an Independent Verification Agency, with a sampling framework that covers 6136 villages, 92040 households, and 5782 schools, 5803 Anganwadi Centres, 1015 Public toilets and 6055 Public spaces, making it the most representative sanitation survey in the country. The 2018-19 NARSS found the rural toilet usage to be 93.4%, and toilet usage in rural India to be 96.5%. Two more independent surveys conducted in the past by the Quality Council of India in 2017, and National Sample Survey Organization in 2016, also found the usage of these toilets to be 91% and 95% respectively.

The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation was approached by Reuters ahead of publishing this story and had responded to each question raised by them in detail. However, the story published presents a one-sided view of the situation with all the details shared with Reuters by the Ministry about the NARSS survey portrayed as limited, half-sentences and deficient responses.  

The Ministry would like to put out the complete version of the on-ground reality of the Mission as well as the Survey in context of the allegations made in this biased piece:


	““The whole point of this is for people’s health,” said Payal Hathi, a researcher consulted on the World Bank-backed survey. “It’s unfortunate that the data is so misleading.”… Hathi and fellow researcher Nikhil Srivastav also say they witnessed several lapses at meetings held to design the survey.”


The article says that the Ministry categorically dismissed and denied the claims of the two RICE researchers “without elaborating”. In reality, however, this Ministry shared a detailed background and elaboration with its dismissal of claims made by RICE researchers. 

Firstly, the methodology and processes of the NARSS have been developed and approved by the Expert Working Group (EWG), which is chaired by Prof. Amitabh Kundu of JNU and former member of the National Statistical Commission, and co-chaired by Dr N. C Saxena, former Secretary to Government of India. The EWG comprised several sanitation experts and representatives from national and international developmental organizations, including the World Bank, UNICEF, BMGF, Water Aid India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), NITI Aayog, among others. As the Reuters team was informed, this expert group has overseen and participated in the conduct of the NARSS, from questionnaire design to sampling to training of enumerators to the actual survey in the field. Some RICE representatives also attended a few meetings of the EWG during NARSS 2017-18, and were not associated with NARSS 2018-19 at all. 

By raising questions about NARSS 2018-19 methodology, RICE representatives are not only attempting to undermine the credibility of NARSS (including the eminent EWG members), but also misleading the readers of Reuters. Given that RICE was never a part of any meetings of NARSS 2018-19, their assertion that they witnessed “several lapses at (NARSS) meetings” is a gross misrepresentation of readers and in-line with RICE’s history of biased, motivated and untruthful reporting of facts. (Ref http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1569875, http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1570908, http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1559229)

 


	“Two (surveyors) called NARSS findings “impossible” and said very little time had been spent questioning respondents.”


As was clearly communicated to the Reuters team (but is missing from their article), as per the NARSS protocol the surveyor visiting a particular village is not told about the ODF status of the village to avoid any potential bias. In fact, an individual surveyor gets only a very limited number of villages in a State for survey, much lesser than the total number of villages surveyed in the State. Hence a surveyor (or a few surveyors) is not in a position to provide state wide estimates at all. Additionally, the whole survey process is completed using CAPI – Computer Aided Personal Interviewing – which does not permit an individual surveyor to perform any kind of analysis or generate estimates. Time spent on each interview is also recorded by the CAPI and monitored by the IVA.

 


	““If we see some open defecation in stray cases away from the main centre of a village, we cannot mark the village as non-ODF,” he said, adding trainers from the ministry told surveyors to follow such practices.”


This is strongly denied. As communicated to the Reuters team – both through an email and through a personal interaction at the Ministry office – the very process of the NARSS survey makes this assertion impossible. In fact, the concept of ‘main centre of a village’ is irrelevant because there were clear instructions to not declare a village ODF if they found faecal matter anywhere in the village, including Schools, Hospitals/Public Health Centre, Panchayat Bhawans, Community Centres/Halls, Places of worship- Temple/Masjid/Gurudwara/Church, Bus stand, Market Places, Public or Government Offices, Drinking Water sources etc. Together, these spots will undoubtedly present a holistic picture of open defecation (of lack thereof) in the village and, therefore, the “main centre” of the village is not even a relevant concept in the NARSS methodology.

Furthermore, it is important to note that the Ministry does not directly interact with the surveyors to maintain the integrity of the process. Oversight of the work of the surveyors is conducted by the Senior Project Team of the Independent Verification Agency. 

 


	““The respondents will give you false answers,” said Nitya Jacob, a water and sanitation consultant. “They’re all tutored to say ‘yes-yes,’ we use toilets.””


Again, this is strongly denied. The allegation that all 92,000-plus respondents of the large scale survey would be tutored is naïve at the best and malicious at worst. On the contrary, as mentioned in the official response shared by the Ministry with Reuters, there typically exists a significant respondent bias among households to conceal that they have a toilet, in the expectation of receiving a further financial incentive from the government. This bias has been observed and recorded by both the EWG and the IVA of NARSS, and leads to an artificial underreporting of toilet access and usage, contrary to what the article says. Also, as part of the NARSS protocol, whether a village is ODF or not is not marked by a Surveyor but is analysed by IVA at Centre at the time of analysis of data and information. 

 


	Incidents of open defecation in Haryana


NARSS follows a random sampling process and in Haryana, the IVA surveyed 1530 households in 102 villages. This sample is only representative of the overall State sanitation access and usage. In fact, over the last few years, surveys have consistently maintained that Haryana has been one of the best performing States in rural India in terms of toilet usage, which was found to be 100% as per both, QCI 2017 and NARSS 2017-18 (which had sample sizes of 1.4 lakh households and 92040 households respectively). 

In this regard, while it is difficult to comment on isolated incidents of non-usage, except as explained by the respondent bias mentioned above. Besides, NARSS follows a random sampling process and in Haryana, the IVA surveyed 1530 households in 102 villages. This sample is only representative of the overall State sanitation access and usage.


	Alleged incidents of coercion in Karnataka


The Swachh Bharat Mission strongly supports positive behaviour change and the Ministry takes note of any coercion in implementation very seriously. Unfortunately, many reports – in particular those by motivated agencies like RICE – fail to distinguish between coercion and affirmative community action, like local Nigrani Samitis, or local GP or community level sanctions on open defecation, which reflects the limited understanding of the community approach to sanitation among them. It is notable that this point was never raised by the Reuters team in their questions posed to the Ministry. The Ministry encourages any agency/individual who finds an incidence of coercion on the ground to bring it to the attention of the Ministry and assures that action will be taken against any government official responsible for encouraging it.

The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is disappointed with the factually incorrect and poor quality of reporting done by a reputed agency like Reuters. It is clear that the article is based on a prejudiced and biased perspective on what is widely acknowledged to be a successful Mission and the largest behaviour change programme in the world which has succeeded in lifting more than 550 million people out of open defecation in a short period of less than 5 years.

                The Committee led by the Chairman Dr. Kasturirangan submitted the Draft National Educational Policy to the Union Human Resource Development Minister, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ and Minister of State for HRD, Shri Sanjay Shamrao Dhotre in New Delhi today in the presence of Shri R. Subrahmanyam, Secretary Department of Higher Education and Smt. Rina Ray, Secretary Department of School Education & Literacy and other senior officials of the Ministry. 



 

The Government of India had initiated the process of formulating a New Education Policy to meet the changing dynamics of the requirements of the population with regard to quality education, innovation and research, aiming to make India a knowledge superpower by equipping its students with the necessary skills and knowledge and to eliminate the shortage of manpower in science, technology, academics and industry. The extant National Policy on Education, 1986 modified in 1992 required changes to meet the contemporary and futuristic needs of our large youth population. 

 

For this, the MHRD initiated an unprecedented collaborative, multi-stakeholder, multi-pronged, bottom- up people-centric, inclusive, participatory consultation process. The extensive consultations undertaken across multiple levels of online, expert and thematic, and from the grassroots ranging from Village, Block, Urban Local bodies, District, State, Zonal and the National level, provided an opportunity to every citizen to engage in this massive exercise. Several in-person and in-depth deliberations across a wide spectrum of stakeholders were held. Subsequently, a ‘Committee for Evolution of the New Education Policy’ under the Chairmanship of Late Shri T.S.R. Subramanian, Former Cabinet Secretary, was constituted, which submitted its report in May, 2016. Based on this report, the Ministry prepared ‘Some Inputs for the Draft National Education Policy, 2016’. 

 

The Committee had the onerous task of analysing and examining a humungous volume of suggestions, inputs, reports, and outcome documents that preceded its own efforts. The underlying spirit that dictated the Committee’s own course of crafting this significant document was primarily to bring out a vision document which will hold the test of time for at least another 20 years. The Draft National Education Policy, 2019 is built on the foundational pillars of Access, Equity, Quality, Affordability and Accountability. The Committee has proposed to rename MHRD as Ministry of Education (MoE). 

In School Education, a major reconfiguration of curricular and pedagogical structure with Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) as an integral part of school education is proposed. The Committee also recommends Extension of Right to Education Act 2009 to cover children of ages 3 to 18. A 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure based on cognitive and socio-emotional developmental stages of children: Foundational Stage (age 3-8 yrs): 3 years of pre-primary plus Grades 1-2;  Preparatory Stage (8-11 years): Grades 3-5; Middle Stage (11-14 years): Grades 6-8;  and Secondary Stage (14-18 years): Grades 9-12. Schools will be re-organized into school complexes. It also seeks to reduce content load in school education curriculum. There will be no hard separation of learning areas in terms of curricular, co-curricular or extra- curricular areas and all subjects, including arts, music, crafts, sports, yoga, community service, etc. will be curricular.  It promotes active pedagogy that will focus on the development of core capacities: and life skills, including 21st century skills.

The Committee proposes for massive transformation in Teacher Education by shutting down sub-standard teacher education institutions and moving all teacher preparation/education programmes into large multidisciplinary universities/colleges. The 4-year integrated stage-specific B.Ed. programme will eventually be the minimum degree qualification for teachers. 

In higher education, a restructuring of higher education institutions with three types of higher education institutions is proposed- Type 1: Focused on world-class research and high quality teaching; Type 2: Focused on high quality teaching across disciplines with significant contribution to research; Type 3: High quality teaching focused on undergraduate education. This will be driven by two Missions -Mission Nalanda & Mission Takshashila. There will be re-structuring of Undergraduate programs (e.g. BSc, BA, BCom, BVoc) of 3 or 4 years duration and having multiple exit and entry options. 

A new apex body Rashtriya Shiksha Ayog is proposed to enable a holistic and integrated implementation of all educational initiatives and programmatic interventions, and to coordinate efforts between the Centre and States. The National Research Foundation, an apex body is proposed for creating a strong research culture and building research capacity across higher education.

The four functions of Standard setting, Funding, Accreditation and Regulation to be separated and conducted by independent bodies: National Higher Education Regulatory Authority as the only regulator for all higher education including professional education; Creation of accreditation eco-system led by revamped NAAC; Professional Standard Setting Bodies for each area of professional education and UGC to transform to Higher Education Grants Commission (HEGC). The private and public institutions will be treated on par and education will remain a ‘not for profit’ activity. 

Several new policy initiatives for promoting internationalization of higher education, strengthening quality open and distance learning,  technology integration at all levels of education, adult and lifelong learning  and initiatives to enhance participation of under-represented groups, and eliminate gender, social category and regional gaps in education outcomes are recommended. Promotion of Indian and Classical Languages and setting up three new National Institutes for Pali, Persian and Prakrit and an Indian Institute of Translation and Interpretation (IITI) has been recommended. The path breaking reforms recommended will bring about a paradigm shift by equipping our students, teachers and educational institutions with the right competencies and capabilities and also create an enabling and reinvigorated educational eco-system for a vibrant new India.

	For the last 4-5 days, the sky is mainly clear over Northwest India and there is no thundershower activity. As a result, rise in maximum temperatures by around 2-4 °C were experienced over parts of Northwest India including Delhi NCR. Heat Wave conditions also developed over parts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi NCR. The highest maximum temperature in the plains of Northwest India was 47.6°C recorded at Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh) on 29 May 2019.
	Analysis of high resolution global and regional Numerical model products, satellite information and prevailing weather observations are indicating mainly clear sky over plains of Northwest India including Delhi-NCR till 3 June. Advection of heat from west, subsidence over the region and lack of Rain/Thunderstorm activity will lead to further rise in Maximum temperatures by about 2°C in the region and it may cross 45°C at many places and may even touch 47°C at some places in the region especially over Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.
	A Western Disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan region mainly from 02 June, however it is unlikely to cause significant Thunderstorm activity over the plains.


 

Heat Waves Warnings for next 4-5 days


	Heat wave conditions likely to prevail at isolated places over Jammu area during next 72 hours.
	Heat wave conditions likely to prevail at many places with Severe heat wave at a few places over East Uttar Pradesh and West Rajasthan.
	Heat wave conditions likely to prevail at many places with Severe heat wave at isolated places over West Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi NCR and East Rajasthan.
	Heat wave conditions likely at a few places over Punjab and Chandigarh.


 

Forecast for Delhi/NCR

Mainly Clear Sky. Heat wave conditions are likely to prevail at few places during next 24 hours. Thereafter, during next 2-3 days, there is also a possibility of development of severe heat wave conditions with maximum temperature touching 46-47 °C at isolated pockets.

	Campaign launched by Wildlife Crime Control Bureau of India and UN Environment aimed at airports across India. 
	Tiger, Pangolin, Star Tortoise and Tokay Gecko featured in the campaign.
	In India, illegal trade in wildlife has seen a sharp rise in recent years. 


Ahead of the International Day of Biological Diversity celebrated on May 22, UN Environment India and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) of India launched an awareness campaign ‘Not all animals migrate by choice’ to be displayed at major airports across the country. Actor, Producer, UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador and recently appointed Secretary-General’s SDG Advocate, Dia Mirza inaugurated the campaign in presence of officials from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau of India, UN Environment, UN agencies and GMR Group. 

 



 

“Conservation is innate to India’s ethos. While wildlife faces threat across the globe and India’s flora and fauna’s demand continues in illegal global markets, in keeping with our stringent provisions for protection of wildlife under the Wild life (Protection) Act, 1972, efforts towards creating awareness among public at large would go a long way to help protect our wildlife,” said, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri CK Mishra

Illegal wildlife trade is driving species to the brink of extinction. A thriving industry with organized wildlife crime chains spreading across the world, in India, illegal trade in wildlife has seen a sharp rise. The campaign ‘Not all animals migrate by choice’ aims at creating awareness and garnering public support for the protection and conservation of wildlife, prevention of smuggling and reduction in demand for wildlife products. The campaign also complements worldwide action on illegal trade in wildlife through UN Environment’s global campaign, Wild for Life.

“There is an urgent need for awareness, action and stringent enforcement of laws to put an end to all illegal wildlife trade threatening biodiversity and conservation in the wild. This campaign is an important step forward in creating much-needed awareness on wildlife trafficking which threatens the very survival of these species,” said Atul Bagai, Head, UN Environment India.  

In the first phase of the campaign, Tiger, Pangolin, Star Tortoise and Tokay Gecko have been chosen as they are highly endangered due to illegal trading in International markets. Tiger is traded for its skin, bones and body parts; Pangolin, the most illegally traded wild mammal on the planet is trafficked for its meat and its scales are used in traditional medicines; Star Tortoise for meat and pet trade and Tokay Gecko in traditional medicine mostly into South East Asia and particularly Chinese Markets. Phase two will see more threatened species and explore other routes of trafficking.

 



 

“A huge global demand for our flora and fauna is a major cause for illegal wildlife trade by ruthless cross border smugglers. WCCB stands committed to fight this organized crime but it is crucial to work together across various government and non-government organizations, private sector and civil society to save wildlife. Our awareness campaign at Airports is a step towards reaching out to the public,” said Tilotama Varma, Additional Director, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau of India

Recent media reports on seizures of illegally traded species and their parts at airports is a growing indication of rampant wildlife trafficking. Some of the major wildlife species being smuggled through airports are star tortoises, live birds, Shahtoosh shawls, tiger and leopard body parts, ivory, rhino horns, pangolin and pangolin scales, sea shells, sea-horse, Sea-cucumber, red sanders, agarwood, deer antlers, mongoose hairs, reptile skins, live snakes, lizards, corals, orchids and medicinal plants.  

Dia Mirza, Actor, Producer, UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador & Secretary-General’s SDG Advocate said, “Wildlife trafficking thrives on ignorance and indifference to the species and laws that govern it .This campaign gives a glimpse of the cruelty and suffering these magnificent species have to endure for being trafficked. The need of the hour is greater awareness and commitment to protecting these species to ensure that they not just survive but also thrive in the wild.”

In collaboration with the Airports Authority of India and GMR Group, the campaign will travel across 22 airports across India over the next year. Both WCCB and UN Environment initiated a comprehensive approach with a focus on awareness building of various stakeholders towards the issue of prevention of illegal trade and smuggling of wildlife and wildlife products through exit points. The awareness campaign is expected to complement the efforts of the Govt. Agencies.

UN Environment is the leading global voice on the environment. It provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations. UN Environment works with governments, the private sector, the civil society and with other UN entities and international organizations across the world.

Wildlife Crime Control Bureau is a statutory multi-disciplinary body established by the Government of India under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, to combat organized wildlife crime in the country.. Under Section 38 (Z) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, it is mandated to collect and collate intelligence related to organized wildlife crime activities and to disseminate the same to State and other enforcement agencies for immediate action so as to apprehend the criminals; to establish a centralized wildlife crime data bank; co-ordinate actions by various agencies in connection with the enforcement of the provisions of the Act; assist foreign authorities and international organization concerned to facilitate co-ordination and universal action for wildlife crime control; capacity building of the wildlife crime enforcement agencies for scientific and professional investigation into wildlife crimes and assist State Governments to ensure success in prosecutions related to wildlife crimes; and advise the Government of India on issues relating to wildlife crimes having national and international ramifications, relevant policy and laws. It also assists and advises the Customs authorities in inspection of the consignments of flora & fauna as per the provisions of Wild Life Protection Act, CITES and EXIM Policy governing such an item.

                The joint meetings of three conventions on chemicals and waste that is the fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal  (COP 14) was held along with the ninth meeting of the COP to Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the ninth meeting of the COP to Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. The theme of the meetings this year was “Clean Planet, Healthy People: Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste”.  

 

An Indian delegation of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and comprising other ministries such as Agriculture, Chemicals, and Electronics and Information Technology participated in the meeting held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 29 April to 10 May 2019.

In Basel Convention, two important issues were discussed and decided, i.e. technical guidelines on e-waste and inclusion of plastic waste in the PIC procedure. The draft technical guidelines stipulated the conditions when used electrical and electronic equipment destined for direct reuse, repair, refurbishment or failure analysis should be considered as non-waste. India had major reservations regarding these provisions as in the name of re-use, repair, refurbishment and failure analysis there was a possibility of dumping from the developed world to the developing countries including India in view of the growing consumption of electronic equipment and waste across the world.  The Indian delegation strongly objected the proposed decision on these guidelines during plenary and did not allow it to be passed by the conference of the parties (COP). 

Many rounds of multilateral and bilateral negotiations happened under the aegis of the Convention Secretariat in order to address India’s concerns which were supported by a large number of other developing countries. On the final day of the COP, a modified decision was adopted in which all the concerns raised by India were incorporated. 

These were: dumping of e-waste in developing countries; recognition that the interim guideline has issues and further work is required specially on the provision on distinguishing waste from non-waste; the guidelines were adopted on an interim basis only; the tenure of the expert working group was extended to address the concerns raised by India; and the usage of interim guidelines to be done only on a pilot basis.

Due to the strong intervention by the Indian delegation, it was possible to defend the country’s interest against the potential dumping of e-waste by developed countries and thereby opened a window for further negotiations and corrections in the interim technical guidelines on e-waste.  

Under the Basel Convention, another major achievement of COP 14 was the decision to amend the convention to include unsorted, mixed and contaminated plastic waste under PIC (Prior Informed Consent) procedure and improve the regulation of its transboundary movement. This is a significant step taken towards addressing plastic pollution which has become a major environmental concern across the globe. 

Further, Basel Convention has also adopted partnership on plastic which was welcomed by the Indian delegation. These steps will help prevent the illegal dumping of plastic wastes in developing countries. India has already imposed a complete prohibition of import of solid plastic waste into the country.  India has also made an international commitment to phase-out single-use plastic. India fully supported this exercise and one of the members of the Indian delegation was co-chair in the contact group which negotiated this agreement for amendment in the annexes of Basel Convention to bring plastic waste under PIC procedure.

Under the Stockholm Convention the COP decided to list “Dicofol” in Annex A without any exemption. The “PFOA” was also listed with some exemptions in the Annex A of the Stockholm Convention.  Under the Rotterdam Convention, two new chemicals (Phorate and HBCD) were added in the list for mandatory PIC procedure in international trade.

                India CEO Forum on Climate Change organized by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), as the pioneering initiative of the government, inviting industry representatives, exchanged views on climate change issues and discussed opportunities to collaborate in regard to fulfilling India’s national as well as international climate change commitments.

Businesses are recognised as crucial to meeting global climate change goals and forum on Climate Change focused on driving transition to a low-carbon economy. It delivered powerful messages as leaders from the private and public sector gathered to showcase their commitment to tackle climate change. 

The Forum consisted of high-level discussions across several sessions covering topics from India’s Nationally Determined Contributions to discussions on the 2019 United Nations Secretary General’s Climate Summit, to be held on 23rd September, 2019 in New York, in which India along with Sweden will be leading the discussions on Industry Transition. The sessions voiced deliberations from the government on India’s international commitments to fighting climate change as well as deliberations from businesses on private sector actions around climate change and future visions for a low-carbon trajectory. 

From the government, Mr. Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, Mr. C.K. Mishra, Secretary, MoEFCC, Mr. Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Secretary Ministry of Power, Mr. A.K. Jain, Additional Secretary, MoEFCC and Mr. Ravi S. Prasad, Additional Secretary, MoEFCC set the tone for the discussions. Several prominent members from India’s private and public sector spoke at the Forum to share ways in which they are supporting India to meet its climate change objectives. A separate high-level CEO session was also organized exclusively for industry leaders. The Forum brought together more than 50 high-profile leaders from the Indian business world. 

Secretary MoEFCC, Shri C.K. Mishra highlighted that the forum was being conducted to create a mechanism for the government and businesses to formally talk about climate change issues and develop a common voice at global forums so that there is no disconnect between the stand of the government and that of the industries. He said that this forum will help the government move from a language-based narrative on climate change to an action-based narrative and highlighted the important role that businesses play in dealing with global warming issues and a platform like this will help share best practices and facilitate cross-learning.

CEO Niti Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant complimented MoEFCC for this initiative and bringing together the government, public sector and private sector. He said that Government’s policies need to have cross-sectional coordination and involve all players including the government, private sector and researchers. “Private sector should start technologically leapfrogging which will be much easier to achieve in India rather than western nations where the availability of old technology is more widespread.” said Sh. Kant

The forum was successful in clearly communicating to the industry leadership the government’s vision on climate change and for the first time, seeking the views of the industries on the same as well examples of the climate initiatives being undertaken by the private and public sector. MoEFCC resolved to organize more such meetings and encouraged industry to also take the lead in furthering discussions on climate change.

                Sub-section (1C) of section 197A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) read with rule 29C of the Rules, inter alia, provides that no deduction of tax shall be made in case of a resident individual, who is of the age of sixty years or more, if he furnishes a declaration in Form 15H to the person responsible for paying any income of the nature referred to in section 192A, 193, 194, 194A, 194D, 194DA, 194EE, 194-I or 194K, to the effect that the tax on his estimated total income will be nil.

Further, Note 10 to Form No 15H provides for non-acceptance of declaration if the amount of income of the nature referred to in section 197A(1C) or the aggregate of the amounts of such income credited or paid or likely to be credited or paid during the previous year in which such income is to be included exceeds the maximum amount which is not chargeable to tax after allowing for deduction(s) under Chapter VIA, if any, set off of loss, if any, under the head “income from house property” for which the declarant is eligible. 

Section 87A of the Act has been amended vide Finance Act, 2019 which provides that a resident individual, having total income up to Rs. 5 lakh, shall be entitled to a rebate of an amount being the amount of tax chargeable or Rs. 12,500/-, whichever is less. 

However, at present, the note 10 of Form 15H does not take into account the maximum allowable rebate of Rs 12,500/- provided under section 87A as above, which is available to the assessee in respect of the tax calculated on income, there could be cases, where, though income of the assessee would be above the minimum amount chargeable to income-tax, tax liability may be nil after taking into account the rebate available under section 87A. Deduction of tax in such cases may cause undue hardship to senior citizens.  

Accordingly, Income-tax Rules, 1962 have been amended by way of insertion of proviso in Note 10 of Form No 15H and have already been notified vide Notification No G.S.R. 375(E) dated 22nd May, 2019, so as to provide that the person responsible for paying the income referred to in column 15 of Part I shall accept the declaration in the case of the assessee, being a senior citizen, who is eligible for rebate of income-tax under section 87A, and his/her tax liability is nil after taking into account this rebate.

                 Section 12A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) provides for conditions for applicability of Sections 11 and 12 of the Act. One such condition under  clause (b) of sub-section (1) thereof is that where the total income of the trust or institution computed without giving effect to Section 11 and 12 exceeds the maximum amount not chargeable to Income-Tax in any previous year, its  accounts for that year have been audited by an accountant as defined in the Explanation below sub-section (2) of Section 288.

 

It further provides that the person in receipt of the said income, furnishes along with the Return of Income for the relevant Assessment Year, the Report of such Audit in the Prescribed Form duly signed and verified by such accountant and setting forth such particulars as may be prescribed.

 

Accordingly, vide Income-tax (2nd Amendment) Rules, 1973 w.e.f. April 1, 1973 Rule 17B and Form 10B were inserted in the Income-tax Rules, 1962 (the Rules) for this purpose. Rule 17B of the Rules provide that said Report of Audit of the accounts of a trust or institution shall be in Form No. 10B. The Form No 10B besides providing the Audit Report, also provides for filing of “Statement of particulars” as Annexure.

 

As the Rule and Form were notified long ago, there is a need to rationalise them to align with the requirements of the present times.

 

In view of the above, the Rule and Form are proposed to be amended by way of substituting-

(a)          Rule 17B with a new Rule 17B; and

(b)          Form No 10B with a new Form No 10B.

           

The Draft Notification proposing the above amendments has been formulated and uploaded on www.incometaxindia.gov.in for inputs from stakeholders and general public. The inputs on the Draft Rules may be sent electronically at the email address, niraj.kumar82[at]nic[dot]in, latest by June 5, 2019.

                Online writing of APARs in SPARROW for IRS (C&CE) Officers has already been implemented w.e.f. 2016-17. As part of CBIC’s constant endeavor for better HR management, online writing of APARs in SPARROW has now been launched for over 46,000 Group B & C officers of CBIC, working in its various formations all across the country.

The Project has been inaugurated by Shri P.K.Das, Chairman, CBIC today from the Board Office, North Block, New Delhi in presence of Member (Admn)-CBIC Shri A.K. Pandey, and officers of DGHRM-CBIC. The Directorate General of Human Resource Management (DGHRM), the HR arm of CBIC is the implementing Agency of this ambitious project. It is being implemented in over 400 formations of CBIC across the country.

SPARROW-CBIC is one of its kind in terms of Scale/ number of employees covered as far as Central Government Departments are concerned. It brings a complete change in APAR management of such large number of Group ‘B’ & ‘C’ Officers/ Staff of CBIC, which would, in turn, lead to better HR Management.

This Project leverages modern technology for enhancing the overall efficiency and morale of the huge workforce working in Central GST and Customs formations of CBIC. The Project is an important milestone in the journey towards digitisation and paper less working.

                1.  The Technical Report of Services Sector Enterprises in India, which was finalized under the 74th Round of National Sample Survey, was released recently by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The survey utilized a sample of 35456 enterprises taken from the database of Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). The Report has stated that 38.7 percent of the sample of 35456 enterprises comprised out-of-survey units. Some sections of the media have misinterpreted these out-of-survey enterprises (as classified for the purposes of surveying the services sector) to be enterprises that do not exist in the economy. On the basis of this interpretation, the suggestion has emerged that by not removing out-of-survey enterprises from the MCA database, Central Statistics Office (CSO) over-estimates the Gross Domestic Product of the country. This Press Release is intended to clarify the aforesaid misconceptions.

 

2.   Of the 38.7 percent out-of-survey enterprises in the NSSO report, out-of-coverage enterprises comprise 21.4 percent. The out-of-coverage enterprises are simply those enterprises that are not engaged in activities intended for inclusion in the service sector survey. However, these enterprises are engaged in some economic activity, possibly in the manufacturing sector for instance. As a result, they cannot be classified as out-of-coverage enterprises for the purposes of estimating the GDP of the country. In other words, the GDP estimates based on the aforesaid out-of-coverage enterprises are very much a part of overall GDP of the country.

 

3.  Of the remaining 17.3 percent out-of-survey enterprises, establishments that are not considered in the MCA database for GDP estimation comprise 0.9 percent. The balance 16.4 percent are either closed or non-traceable enterprises. However, with continuous evolution of the MCA database, the proportion of closed and non-traceable enterprises has been falling. Thus the extent of overestimation of GDP in all likelihood is marginal.

 

4.   Crucially, we must note that the share of total paid up capital of the private corporate sector that is accounted by non-responsive enterprises affects GDP estimates using the MCA database; not the number of non-responsive enterprises in the private corporate sector. The following table shows from 2012-13 to 2016-17 the number of active firms and the firms whose information was directly used for GVA estimation.

From 2012-13 to 2016-17, the number of enterprises whose annual returns were not available for GDP estimation accounted for only 12-15 percent of paid-up capital of all the enterprises in the MCA database. As such the GVA estimated for the responsive enterprises was increased by a blow-up factor of only 1.13-1.17 to estimate the GVA of the entire private corporate sector. Most of the non-responsive enterprises did not provide data because they exercised their discretion of filing returns in subsequent years while continuing to engage in activities reflected in their previously filed return. Accordingly, their inclusion in the overall GVA estimation was legitimate.

 

5.    Finally, even when there is a small over- or under-estimation, the blowing up affects the level of GDP and not the year-to-year annual growth rates materially. As seen in Table 1 above, the proportion of firms in the MCA data base that have ceased their operations varies minimally from year to year from 2012-13 to 2016-17.  This feature ensures that although GVA levels could be slightly more or less than what they actually are, the growth rate of GVA from year to year will not be affected.

 

6.    The MCA data base on the private corporate sector is a valuable addition to the data sources available for estimation of GDP and its use provides a more correct measure of economic activity in the country.

                There have been some incorrect reports in media pertaining to reduction in numbers of Income Tax Returns(ITR) e-filed during Financial Year(F.Y.) 2018-19 as compared to F.Y. 2017-18. This is factually untrue, because the figures for F.Y. 2017-18 and F.Y. 2018-19 are not directly comparable.  

It is stated that during F.Y. 2017-18, out of a total of 6.74 crore ITRs which were e-filed, 5.47 crore ITRs were filed for Assessment Year(A.Y.) 2017-18 (the current year). In comparison, during F.Y. 2018-19, a total of 6.68 crore ITRs were e-filed which included 6.49 crore ITRs of current A.Y. 2018-19 marking an increase of almost 19%. This would imply that substantially larger number of taxpayers filed their ITRs electronically in the F.Y. 2018-19 as compared to F.Y. 2017-18.

Furthermore, during F.Y. 2017-18, apart from the returns for the A.Y. 2017-18, nearly 1.21 crore ITRs were filed for A.Y. 2016-17. The balance number of ITRs filed for A.Y. 2015-16 and prior A.Ys is 0.06 crore. In comparison, during F.Y. 2018-19 only 0.14 crore ITRs for A.Y. 2017-18 were filed. Thus, the apparent decrease in the number of ITRs filed during F.Y. 2018-19 pertaining to earlier years was due to an amendment in Section 139(5) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 brought in vide Finance Act, 2017, w.e.f. 01.04.2018, which mandated that a revised return could be furnished only upto the end of the relevant Assessment Year. As a result, only 0.14 crore ITRs pertaining to A.Y. 2017-18 were filed during F.Y. 2018-19 as these were the revised ITRs for the relevant A.Y. which could only be filed due to change in law and no other ITR of any earlier A.Y. could be filed in view of the amended provisions of law. 

These figures are also available in the Tab-> 'Filing growth (A.Y.)' on the e-filing website.

It is also stated that the number of paper ITRs for A.Y. 2017-18 was only 9.2 lakh (1.5% of total ITRs filed) and the number of paper ITRs for A.Y. 2018-19 is 4.8 lakh (0.6% of total ITRs filed). As per the above details, it is evident that most of the taxpayers have steadily switched to e-filing which is clear from the dwindling numbers of paper returns filed for A.Y. 2018-19 compared to earlier years.

                Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is organizinga two-day orientation workshop for Population Research Centres (PRCs) to highlight the various features of the flagship schemes of the Health Ministry for concurrent monitoring. Inaugurating the national workshop today at New Delhi, Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) stated there is an urgent need for PRCs to reinvent themselves to become more relevant. She further stated that PRCs should integrate with the institute they are anchored in for more thoughtful insights of local and current issues to enrich their research. At the event, Ms. Preeti Sudan also released the Rural Health Statistics (2017-18) and a Compendium of Studies Conducted by the PRCS (2017-18).

Shri Manoj Jhalani (AS&MD) and Shri D K Ojha, DDG (Stats.) along with other senior officers of the Ministry and representatives from state PRCs were also present at the function.

Secretary (Health) further stated that Ayushman Bharat is a flagship program of the government and has two components - Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) for Comprehensive Primary Health Care and Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (PMJAY) for secondary and tertiary care. These components are linked to address the major challenges of ensuring continuum of care, two-way referral system and gatekeeping. 

Ms. Preeti Sudan said that the government is committed to strengthening 1,50,000 facilities as Health and Wellness Centres which will deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care closer to where people live in rural and urban areas. “PRCs can provide critical research based inputs to strengthen these initiatives further,” Ms. Preeti Sudan added.

Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has established the network of 18 Population Research Centres (PRCs) spread over 17 major States/UTs, with the mandate to provide, inter alia, critical research based inputs related to the Health and Family Welfare programs and policies at the national and state levels. The PRCs are autonomous in nature and administratively under the control of their host University/Institutions. The scheme started with establishment of 2 PRCs at Delhi and Kerala in 1958 and expanded to 18 PRCs with latest inclusion of PRC, Sagar during 1999. Of these, 12 are attached to various Universities and 6 are in research institutions of national repute.

The PRCs were established to undertake research projects relating to family planning, demographic research and biological studies & qualitative aspect of population control, with a view to gainfully utilize the feedback from these research studies for plan formulation, strategies and policy interventions of ongoing schemes. They are also involved in other studies given by Ministry such as Concurrent Evaluation of NRHM conducted by the Ministry throughout the country during 2008-09, large scale sample surveys of the Ministry like District Level Household survey (DLHS), National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI), All India study on “Rapid Appraisal of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) Implementation in 36 Districts of 20 States of India” in the recent past. In addition, they also monitor important components of NHM Programme Implementation Plans.  Till now, the PRCs have completed more than 3600 research studies since inception. They have more than 110 research papers published in prestigious international journals.

                The Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba has called on the States and Union Territories to step up their preparedness by advance planning and deployment of human, physical and financial resources ahead of the monsoon season. In his inaugural address at the annual conference of Relief Commissioners/Secretaries to review Preparedness for South West Monsoon-2019, he said that the Centre would provide all possible assistance under the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) and the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) besides mobilization of Central Forces. Shri Gauba said the Centre had released more than Rs. 7,000 crores under SDRF and an additional Rs. 10,000 crore under NDRF last year to the States for Disaster Relief.

He called upon the States to undertake capacity building of urban local bodies, State Disaster Response Force, Fire Service and Civil Defence since they are the first responders during a calamity. He urged the States to increase coverage of farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana crop insurance scheme to provide immediate relief to farmers in the event of natural disasters. 

During the recent Cyclone Fani, Shri Gauba said loss of human lives was minimal due to accurate and early weather forecasting by India Meteorological Department (IMD) and timely mobilization of resources besides better coordination among Centre, State Governments and other relevant agencies. Commending the excellent work done by various agencies in mitigating the hardships caused by Cyclone Fani, he asked the States to further improve their capabilities to be able to effectively handle the disaster situations.

Citing a UN Report, the Union Home Secretary said disasters had caused economic losses of US $3 trillion globally during the last two decades. India alone suffered losses to the tune of $80 billion during 1997-2017. Stating that our country is prone to various kinds of disasters, Shri Gauba called for building Disaster Resilient Infrastructure as a long term measure to minimize the economic losses. 

The Union Home Secretary said the Government has sanctioned additional Battalions of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and new Battalions are being set up in J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi NCR. 

Speaking on the occasion, Director General, IMD, Dr. KJ Ramesh said India has set a new benchmark in Disaster Risk Reduction as demonstrated during the recent cyclone Fani. IMD is in the process of building the most advanced Early Warning Weather System in coordination with various stakeholders, he added.

In his address, Dr. DN Sharma, Member, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), said that India has been able to reduce deaths due to natural disasters substantially. While 385 people had died last year due to natural disasters, the figure came down to 195 this year. He said the NDMA has come out with the Urban Flood Management Plan in 2015, which can serve as a template for tackling monsoon flooding. The NDMA provides Rs. One Lakh to each district to conduct mock disaster prevention and awareness exercises.

Director General, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Shri SN Pradhan said prediction, prepositioning of resources and proactive partnerships among various stakeholders are crucial for effective countering of natural disasters.

                A high level Indian delegation headed by Dr P.K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to Prime Minister is participating in the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction 2019 being held at Geneva, Switzerland from 13-17 May 2019.

            While presenting the Country Statement today, Dr Mishra briefed on the steps taken by India, after the adoption of the Sendai Framework. He mentioned that India is not only focusing on reducing mortality from major disasters but also from small or medium, and locally-specific disasters such as heat wave, thunderstorm and lightning. Focussed attention and investments in cyclone risk mitigation has yielded dividends in saving precious  human lives. Deaths during cyclone Phailin in 2013 and Fani in 2019 have reduced considerably. 

   Towards continuous efforts on preparedness, earlier this year, Dr. Mishra said the Government has issued national guidelines for managing the risk of losses from Thunderstorm, Lightning, Squall, Dust Storm, Hailstorm and Strong winds. Taken together these natural hazards are among the biggest killers in India. It will help improve the capacity of our States, assist with local level Action Planning, and ultimately help reduce preventable losses from such frequently occurring disasters, he added.

        Similarly on national and local disaster risk reduction strategies, Dr Mishra said that  based on the National Disaster Management Plan of 2016, all the States and more than 95% of Districts in India have prepared their Disaster Management Plans. ​

           Dr Mishra outlined that India believes in working together with other nations in DRR as there are common challenges, benefits of sharing best practices and a need to respond together for search and rescue.  Towards this end, India hosted the First ‘BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise’ in the National Capital Region in October 2017. Likewise, in February 2019, India hosted a meeting on Disaster Risk Management of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), an intergovernmental organization of 22 members and nine dialogue partners. These Exercises provided a platform for sharing Best Practices on all aspects of DRR, and for strengthening regional response and coordination among BIMSTEC and IORA member countries.​

      Dr Mishra highlighted the urgent need to ensure that the new infrastructure to be created anywhere should be resilient to disaster. In this direction, India has initiated a dialogue with more than 40 countries to build a Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. Such a Coalition would benefit both developed and developing countries and serve as a knowledge and capacity development platform for promoting disaster resilient infrastructure. In order to further develop the notion of a Coalition, India in collaboration with UNISDR, has hosted international Workshops on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure in January 2018 and March 2019. ​

        He informed that in order to encourage innovation and recognise the exceptional contributions of organisations and individuals to disaster risk management in the country, Government of India has instituted an annual national award in the name of our great freedom fighter Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. 

      While concluding, Dr Mishra reaffirmed India’s commitment and support towards implementation of SFDRR and Asia Regional Plan. In this direction India is focusing on strategies and approaches that can help in fulfilling SFDRR commitments and is dedicated to reduce the vulnerabilities and impact of disasters through national efforts as well as regional and international cooperation.

       During the day, Shri Kamal Kishore, Member NDMA, represented India in two working sessions on Global Assessment Report 2019 and Sendai Framework Implementation. He also addressed the press conference of the Global Platform.

                India is unanimously chosen as co-chair of the Consultative Group (CG) of Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) for the fiscal year 2020. The decision was taken during the CG meeting of GFDRR held in Geneva, Switzerland today, on the margins of the 6th Session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (GPDRR) 2019. The CG Meeting was co-chaired by Africa Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States, the European Union (EU) and World Bank. Additionally, GFDRR in cooperation with the UNDRR and the EU is also organizing the 4th edition of World Reconstruction Conference (WRC) on May 13-14, 2019.

  GFDRR is a global partnership that helps developing countries better understand and reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. GFDRR is a grant-funding mechanism, managed by the World Bank, that supports disaster risk management projects worldwide. It is presently working on the ground with over 400 local, national, regional, and international partners and provides knowledge, funding, and technical assistance.

 India became member of CG of GFDRR in 2015 and expressed its interest to co-chair in last meeting of CG held in October 2018. India’s candidature was backed by its consistent progress in disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the country and its initiative to form a coalition on disaster resilient infrastructure.

This will give the country an opportunity to work with the member countries and organizations of GFDRR with a focused contribution towards advancing the disaster risk reduction agenda during the course of the year. This is the first time that the country has been afforded the opportunity of co-chairing the CG meeting of GFDRR. India would like to pursue a focused agenda and develop synergies with ongoing work streams of GFDRR. Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (DRI) will be a central theme of engagement with the GFDRR partners and stakeholders.

The meeting of CG of GFDRR was attended by Shri Kamal Kishore, Member, NDMA and Shri Sanjeev Kumar Jindal, Joint Secretary (DM).

                In a special event today, John Bailey, President of Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences (popularly known as Oscar Academy), e-launched the Hindi translation of an Academy Publication, ""Digital Dilemma"", in Delhi. Also present on the occasion were renowned film editor and Governor of Academy Ms. Carol Littleton; Justice Manmohan Sarin, Chairman, FCAT; Shri Amit Khare, Secretary, Ministry of I&B; Shri Prasoon Joshi, Chairman, CBFC; Shri Ujwal Nirgudkar, Member of the Academy and Shri Prakash Magdum, Director, NFAI.



During his speech, John Bailey said that the translation of the Academy publication into Hindi is important in order to reach out to film fraternity in India. There are many challenges thrown by the technological changes in the film storage medium and this book will help film makers in understanding and planning the storage of born-digital material, he said.

Written by Milt Shelton and Andy Maltz, this publication has been translated in many languages the world over. National Film Archive of India, the premier organization of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting which is involved in film conservation, preservation and restoration, had signed an MoU with the Academy to translate the publication into Hindi so that it can benefit various stakeholders in the country.

The Academy works towards the goal of advancing the arts and sciences of motion pictures. 

In its landmark report, the Academy’s Science and Technology Council examined ways in which key players in the movie business currently store and access important digital data. Through years of research, the Council discovered that issues of digital storage reliability go far beyond lost snapshots and spreadsheets. The publication discusses the challenges of efficiently archiving and accessing the massive data in the long term.

                In a landmark achievement for Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) Pune, theAll India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has granted approval to five courses of FTII under AICTE's newly created APPLIED ARTS AND CRAFTS category. This approval makes India's premier film school,FTII,the first and only Institute in this category in the country to receive such recognition.

A list of Institutions and approved Courses published by AICTE on Saturday,11th May under its newly-constituted category pertaining to Institutes offering courses in applied arts,crafts and design, includes FTII and all its five one-year Post Graduate Certificate courses.

Of the five FTII courses which have received AICTE approval, four are in Television wing (Direction, Electronic Cinematography, Video Editing and Sound Recording & TV Engineering) and one in Film wing (Feature Film Screenplay Writing).

""This is a historic moment for FTII to have received AICTE approval for all five PG Certificate courses.This makes FTII the first film school in India to receive this recognition.

In recent years FTII's television courses have been in the limelight winning several National awards and even international honours. The AICTE approval lends more value to the TV courses making them as attractive as the film wing specializations. Screen writers from FTII are already making their mark in the entertainment industry. With the AICTE  approval coming into effect from 2019-20, students entering TV courses and Feature Film Screenplay Writing course this year stand to gain.This is as important a watershed event as the Master's degree equivalence granted to FTII's  six PG Diploma film wing courses by Association of Indian Universities (AIU) in January 2017. With this,  all 11 FTII courses now stand approved by either AIU or AICTE."", said Sh Brijendra Pal Singh,Chairman, FTII Governing Council.

                India Pavilion is set to be inaugurated at Cannes Film Festival, which will be held from 14th to 25th May 2019. The Pavilion will showcase Indian cinema across linguistic, cultural and regional diversity, with the aim of forging international partnerships in distribution, production, filming in India, script development, technology, promoting film sales and syndication. It will be set up by Ministry of Information & Broadcasting in association with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The Pavilion serves as a platform for the Indian Delegates to meet International Delegates attending the Festival to promote networking with other countries and organizations. The Pavilion also serves as an information dissemination point about India and Indian Cinema for the Global Film Community. 

The Indian Delegation this year will be led by Shri Amit Khare, Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting. The Film Delegation would consist of Shri Prasoon Joshi, Chairman, CBFC and acclaimed filmmakers Shri Rahul Rawail, Shri Shaji N. Karun and Shri Madhur Bhandarkar. 



During the Festival, the Indian Delegation will be interacting with key stakeholders of Cannes as well as other members of the film fraternity. A key focus area of the Indian Delegation this year will be to promote the Golden Jubilee Edition of International Film Festival of India to be held in Goa later this year. A specially designed IFFI poster for the Golden Jubilee Edition will also be released during the Festival. 

The Delegation will also popularise steps taken to ease shooting films in India through Film Facilitation Office that facilitates Single Window Clearance for film-makers and steps by the Government to combat film piracy. To take advantage of availability of technicians and skilled professionals, India will be showcased as a post-production hub to promote collaborations for films with international production houses. A comprehensive Film Guide will also be distributed at the India Pavilion to showcase the importance of the film ecosystem and Government incentives to shoot in India.  

Elaborating further, Shri Amit Khare, Secretary, I&B Ministry said that “the initiatives such as co-production and single window clearance would facilitate integration of the Indian Film makers with production houses worldwide.” He further added that “it would be possible for filmmakers of different countries to come together under bilateral co-production agreements. These arrangements would also forge new markets and wider audiences by making India a hub for shooting world class international movies.”

The meeting focussed on various aspects of making of feature film on the life and works of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, co-production of which had earlier been announced by the Hon’ble Prime Ministers of both the countries. The movie will be directed by acclaimed filmmaker Shri Shyam Benegal who, along with scriptwriter of the movie Shri Atul Tiwari, was also present during the meeting.

The Bangladesh Delegation assured full cooperation in ensuring smooth logistics for shooting the movie in Bangladesh. Shri Atul Tiwari, script writer, would travel to Bangladesh to do background research for the project – he will be assisted by Shri Piplu Khan, noted film personality from Bangladesh.

As a reciprocal gesture, Bangladesh Delegation announced that a Doordarshan channel will be adopted on the soon to be launched DTH platform of Bangladesh.

A working agreement on cooperation between All India Radio and Bangladesh Betar was also agreed upon between the two countries, implementation of which would start from June, 2019. 

The Indian Delegation also highlighted the strong network of Community Radio in both the countries and offered the services of Indian Institute of Mass Communication for training of Bangladesh personnel, along with exploration of sharing of content and best practises in this field.

                India has a rich tradition of trade and commerce. Our traders continue to make a strong contribution to India’s economic growth.

In a decision that will benefit the trading community, the Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved a new scheme that offers pension coverage to the trading community. This is a part of the Prime Minister’s vision to provide a robust architecture of universal social security. 

How the scheme works:

Under this scheme all shopkeepers, retail traders and self-employed persons are assured a minimum monthly pension of Rs. 3,000/- month after attaining the age of 60 years.  

All small shopkeepers and self-employed persons as well as the retail traders with GST turnover below Rs. 1.5 crore and age between 18-40 years, can enrol for this scheme.  The scheme would benefit more than 3 crore small shopkeepers and traders. 

The scheme is based on self-declaration as no documents are required except Aadhaar and bank account. Interested persons can enrol themselves through more than 3,25,000 Common Service Centres spread across the country.  

The Government of India will make matching contribution in the subscribers’ account.  For example if a person with age of 29 years contributes Rs. 100/- month, then the Central Government also contributes the equal amount as subsidy into subscriber’s pension account every month. 

Delivering a major promise on Day 1:

By imitating a pension architecture for the trading community, the Prime Minister and his team have fulfilled a major promise made to the people of India. Shri Modi had spoken about the need of proving pension for traders, that would assure them a life of dignity and financial security especially when during their old age. 

This decision can also be seen in the light of several other steps taken for the welfare of traders, small and medium business. The GST underwent significant simplification after taking feedback of the trading community. In the same way, Mudra loans gave wings to the entrepreneurial zeal of young India. Loans upto Rs. 1 crore are now easily available. 

These, and many more efforts would help the trading community.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval to the Resolution advising the President to dissolve the Sixteenth Lok Sabha, which was constituted on 18.05.2014.

Background:

Article 83(2) of the Constitution stipulates that the House of the People, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer and the expiration of the said period of five years shall operate as dissolution of the House.  The first meeting of the Sixteenth Lok Sabha was held on June 4, 2014, when members were administered oath and affirmation.  The life of the present Lok Sabha is, therefore, to expire on June 3, 2019, unless the President dissolves it earlier.

A statement showing the last dates of the polls, dates of the constitution, first sitting and expiration of term and dissolution of the First to Fifteenth Lok Sabha is attached.

                Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today took charge as the cabinet minister of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry.  Shri Pradhan was administered the oath of office and secrecy by the President in a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhawan yesterday. Shri Pradhan was holding the charge of the same Ministry in the last government, after taking over in May 2014.




 

Speaking to the media after taking charge of the Ministry, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan expressed gratitude to the Hon’ble Prime Minister for reposing confidence in him. He said that a lot of reforms and initiatives have been undertaken in the last five years, which positively affected the people’s lives. Last five years saw the Government traversing a successful path of overall economic journey, and the people of the country have given more responsibility to the Prime Minister. He said that our team worked relentlessly in the last five years, and in the future also, we will take up the responsibility as a challenge and work even harder. Shri Pradhan said that increasing domestic oil and gas production will be our priority. The reforms of the last five years have started yielding results, and we will be focussingmore on them. Setting up of common infrastructure, market friendly infrastructure is on the top of the Government’s agenda. Work is going on speedily on setting up of gas grid, PM Urja Ganga project and setting of CGD network and that will be further expedited.  We have given emphasis on promoting bio-fuels, work is being done in this direction and it will gain more momentum in the days to come. The Minister said that work which has been done in the recent past, will be taken ahead in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.  We are starting a new innings, with a new energy and new spirit. Our team has gained a lot from the prime Minister’s vision and leadership. Energy has become an international diplomacy handle, and many countries look towards India. Shri Narendra Modi is seen as a spokesperson of world consumers, and this has been acknowledged by the world. He said that the Ministry will take inputs from all concerned in formulating the policies.

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


	
	
		Crude oil production by ONGCduring April, 2019 was 1690.97 TMT which is 0.44% higher than the target but 4.86% lower when compared with April, 2018.
		Crude oil production by OILduring April, 2019 was 265.21 TMT which is 4.04% lower than the target and 3.33% lower when compared with April, 2018.Shortfall in production was mainly due to less than planned contribution from work over well and drilling wells.
	
	
	
	
		Crude oil production byPvt/JVsin PSC regime during April, 2019 was 756.43TMT which is 0.47% lower than the target and 12.38% lower when compared with April, 2018.Major reasonsin for lower production are:
	
	


 


	Loss from Mangala due to delay in upgrade of Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) and delay in drilling, completion and hooking up online 45 infill wells (CEIL).
	Lower yield from NE development drilling campaign due to geological uncertainties (CEIL).
	Closure of around 100 oil wells due to various reasons like liquid handling constraint at MPT plant, pump failure, surface facility limitation, etc (CEIL).

		CPSE Refineries’ production during April, 2019 was 11263.33TMT which is 3.20%lowerwhen compared with April, 2018.Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:
	
	


 


	IOCL, Guwahati: Restricted due to lower Assam Crude Availability. 
	IOCL, Gujarat: Lower due to extension in M&I shutdown due to delay.
	IOCL, Digboi: Lower due to lowerAssam Crude Availability.
	IOCL, Panipat: Lower due to idling of Naptha splitter for want of PESO clearance. 
	IOCL, Bongaigaon: Restricted due to lower crude availability.
	HPCL, Mumbai: Lower mainly due to deferred shutdown of primary processing unit.
	MRPL: Lower due to non-availability of crude because ofdelay in SPM maintenance activities.

                The High-Level Committee (HLC) constitutedby the Government of India to examine the issues relating to preparation of action plan to create synergy among R&D Centres of Oil & Gas PSUs; tax issues and ways to benefit from GST by the Oil & Gas PSUs today submitted its report to the Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship Sh Dharmendra Pradhan here today.The HLC, consisting of Dr. Anil Kakodkar, eminent Scientist and Shri Sidharth Pradhan, an expert on financial and tax issues, also looked into merger, acquisition and consolidation of Oil & Gas PSUs and the Joint Ventures; explored the need and possibility of formation of new entity dealing with oil services and supply of qualified manpower to Oil & Gas sector around the world. 

Energy security is a key strategic priority for India.During 2018, India consumed 204.92 MMT petroleum products and 58.64 BCM natural gas whereas the domestic production of crude oil and natural gas has almost stagnated. The import dependency of crude oil and LNG during the year was 82.59% and 45.89% respectively which is likely to increase in days to come. During 2018, petroleum import (₹7028.37 billion) was 23.42% of total gross import (₹30010.2 billion) of the nation. India’s projected oil demand is going to grow at CAGR 4% during 2016-2030 against the world average of 1% though the projected oil demand will be much lower as compared to the US and China. India is thus at very precarious situation and to secure its energy needs in sustainable manner, out-of-box solutions are needed. R&D is going to play an important role in the process.

The HLC, in the process visited, different R&D and training institutes of different oil & gas PSUs. It also engaged with CMDs/ senior executives of the Oil sector to understand the business, challenges and opportunities in the sector before writing its recommendations. The Committee has recommended short term, medium term and long term strategiesin the report, clearly bringing out the strategy to reduce the import dependency of the nation. 

Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas will consider the recommendations submitted by the Committee while formulating policies in the said matter.

                FASTags are now available on e-commerce platform Amazon. These were earlier launched by IHMCL, a company promoted by NHAI, in January 2019. NHAI FASTag is a ‘bank-neutral’ FASTag i.e. no bank is pre-assigned to the FASTag at the time of purchase by customer from a Point-of-Sale or Online and offers the flexibility to customer to link the FASTag with their existing bank account by using My FASTag Mobile app, currently available on Google Play Store.

The online NHAI FASTag has been conceived in a DIY (Do-It-Yourself) concept wherein a customer can self-activate it by entering customer and vehicle details in My FASTag mobile app. Thereafter, the customer will have to link the tag to an existing bank account of his/her choice. Currently, the bank linking facility is available for 7 member banks viz. SBI, ICICI Bank, Axis bank, HDFC bank, IndusInd Bank, Paytm Payments bank and Equitas Small Finance Bank. The online NHAI FASTag shall be available for VC-4 i.e. Car/Jeep/Van only for now.

IHMCL is focused on enhancing the user experience of FASTag customers and is constantly working on new strategies to ensure efficient and delightful tolling experience. FASTag is also available at selected petrol pumps in Delhi NCR and identified Common Service Centers (CSCs) and we are also in process of expanding the outreach to other Metros cities. This online sale initiative is an important achievement for IHMCL and will ensure easy availability of FASTag at the doorsteps of the customers.

Currently FASTags are also being issued by 22 certified banks through various channels such as Point-of-Sale at NH toll plazas, selected bank branches, etc. However, these FASTags issued by these certified banks does not offer option to customer for linking with existing bank account of his/her choice. The online availability of NHAI FASTag by IHMCL will eventually help enhanced adoption of FASTag program by increasing user convenience and offering seamless digital payments of toll and thereby saving time, money and fuel. Further, the digital payments of toll shall enhance transparency and promote cashless transactions, converting India into less-cash society supporting the Digital India Programme.

                Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, Prof. Ashutosh Sharma today released four popular science books published by Vigyan Prasar in a book release function held at Indian National Science Academy (INSA) in New Delhi.

The books released were  ‘Voyage to Antarctica’, ‘Story of Consciousness’, ‘An Autobiography of Moon’ and ’Sambhu Nath De - The Discovery of Cholera Toxin’.



Prof. Ashutosh Sharma said that popular science books serve an important purpose of science communication. He pointed out that the efforts of Shambhu Nath De in discovering the Cholera Toxin are not known in his own country. The book on Shambhu Nath De may try to change that situation. Prof. Sharma said that the book ‘Voyage to Antarctica’ may serve as one of the authentic books on Antarctica. He said, The book Story of Consciousness explains how human consciousness has evolved over millions of years, marking a paradigm shift in the journey of humankind from the physical to the mental, a shift that would henceforth determine the onward march of civilization. The book, An Autobiography of Moon has a storytelling format, where, the moon is telling its characteristics to the readers.' The book will be attractive to young readers, said Prof. Sharma.

Addressing the gathering, Director, Vigyan Prasar, Dr. Nakul Parashar said that the primary focus of publication of books is to popularise science communication and take the message of science to the society. 

Voyage to Antarctica chronicles Dr. Felix Bast first-hand experience during the expedition to Antarctica as part of the 36th Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (ISEA) that he undertook during 2016-17. This book narrates the Antarctic expedition chronologically right from the inspiration for undertaking the expedition, acclimatization training at the Himalayas and so on till many months after the completion of the expedition to assess the effect of the expedition on the author's personal and professional life. 

Story of Consciousness book focuses on multiple disciplines like biology, neuroscience, psychology, semiotics, linguistics, philosophy and even theology related to human consciousness. This book is third of the trilogy following Story of Universe and Story of Evolution. This book is basically a story about the evolution of human

An Autobiography of Moon deals with a lot of those secrets like its origin, how it changes its shape daily, why only half of it can be seen, and lots more. Especially discussing all these difficult things in autobiography style will make this book more attractive to young readers.

Shambhu Nath De book is about the great inventor S N De, who contributed a lot to get rid of the cholera epidemic and save our society. Life and works of this great scientist discussed in this book with some unknown side and untold stories.

 

Voyage to Antarctica is authored by Dr. Felix Bast, ""Story of Consciousness"" is authored by Dr. Govind Bhattacharya, An Autobiography of Moon is authored by Dr. Ramesh Shishu and Shambhu Nath De- The Discovery of Cholera Toxin is authored by Dr. M S S Murthy. All the authors were present in the book release function. The books have been published by Vigyan Prasar, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST).

                After decades of ground-breaking laboratory works, the world’s scientific and technical community, in a landmark and historic decision taken in the recent open session of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) at BIPM on 16 November 2018, has unanimously adopted the resolution to redefine four of the seven base units, the kilogram (SI unit of weight), Kelvin (SI unit of temperature), mole (SI unit of amount of substance), and ampere (SI unit of current). This decision has now enabled scientists and researchers to base the SI units entirely on fundamental properties of nature, which will ensure their ongoing refinement and improvement for years to come. The fundamental constants are invariants of time and space and successfully replaced the artifact based units, and aptly opened up the new era for quantum world by linking all seven base units to fundamental constants/quantum standards.

The new SI is being implemented worldwide from 20th May 2019 i.e. the World Metrology Day. The World Metrology Day (WMD) is celebrated annually on this very day as the Metre Convention was signed by representatives of seventeen nations on May 20, 1875. The Convention set the framework for global collaboration in the science of measurement and in its industrial, commercial and societal applications. 

DG CSIR, Shri Shkehar C. Mande present on the occasion congratulated the NPL in bringing out the new units and said that quantum computing, artificial intelligence (AI), Industry 4.0, space enabled communications, are some of the international challenges of the near future and it is necessary for India, the fastest growing economy to make the triumphs to meet the above challenges with the support of quantum metrology based quality infrastructure. 

 

The whole metrology world, especially the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) are celebrating this year's WMD as mark for the new beginning of metrology, based on constant of nature on a large scale. CSIR-NPL, the NMI of India have kept the strides going in these fields and started the R&D efforts in establishing the new SI, alongside the international implementations from 20th May 2019. 

 

On this historic day, CSIR-NPL introduced redefined SI Units to nation in terms of constant of nature through a series of events, delivering lectures, releasing theme (The International System of Units – Fundamentally Better) based poster of BIPM; release of NPL’s designed posters introducing redefined SI to nation highlighting fundamental constant of nature and impact of metrology on all walks of human life; release of poster on technologies transferred, commercialized, patents filed / granted, number of customer served through testing and calibrations by CSIR-NPL during 2018-2019, release of poser on Bhartiya Nirdeshak Dravya (BND) and release of new NPL certified BNDs. 

As a national responsibility and keeping in view of the importance and recognition of new revision of SI, the CSIR-NPL has also prepared documents on i) NPL Policy on Metrological Traceability, ii) recommendations on the proposed changes to be incorporated in the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), New Delhi textbooks and implement the new changes to impart cotemporary education to its students and iii) recommendations on the proposed changes to be incorporated in syllabi of metrology courses in graduate engineering and academic courses being taught in All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), and other academic institutes. 

On this occasion CSIR-NPL also published a book entitled, “Redefined SI Units and Glimpses of NPL Metrological Activities” of almost 100 pages to percolate and disseminate the information accommodating details on new changes, posters and documents mentioned above and role of NPL in strengthening the Indian metrological infrastructure for the govt. representatives, policy makers, regulator, certification bodies, academic institutions, industries and public as a whole.

                To commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) to the Government of India and Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) have come together to bring the best of science and technology to implement waste management in India.

Principal Scientific Advisor to the Govt of India, Prof K. Vijay Raghavan and Director, IIT Delhi, Prof V. Ramgopal Rao signed a Memorandum of Understanding today in New Delhi for setting up a Centre of Excellence for Waste to Wealth Technologies for implementation of sustainable, scientific and technological solutions for waste management, through validation and deployment of available technologies for transformation of waste to wealth. 

The waste to wealth mission project has been approved under the recently constituted Prime Minister’s Science Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC), which is an overarching body for assessment, creation and implementation of major scientific, technology and innovation interventions for India. The partnership will provide an effective platform for stakeholders to bring together integrated approaches for effective recycle, reuse and resource recovery of waste. 

Speaking about the MoU with the Office of the PSA, Prof V. Ramgopal Rao, Director, IIT Delhi, said that we have identified this as a focus area for the institute and many faculty members across the departments and centres at IIT Delhi are already working on a variety of projects related to waste management. “The Idea is to consolidate all possible Waste to Wealth Technologies, learn from the best practices followed worldwide, and implement them on the ground for Indian cities.”, said Prof Rao.

IIT Delhi is already closely involved with the waste management aspects of Delhi and many faculty members are closely involved with the Delhi administration in addressing the waste management issues. 

The immediate objective is to implement technologies that are available with various national and international academias, industries, research laboratories and other agencies by way of setting up pilot projects on-site effectively and successfully, and demonstrating the proof of concept of the technology under Indian condition. This will be carried out by creating a strong collaborating network between IIT Delhi, and other national and international stakeholders through the aegis of the office of the PSA. The long-term goal is to create circular economic models for waste management, by leveraging big data analytics and frontier technologies to streamline waste in India. The overall outcomes would involve treating waste and generating different forms of energy, thereby making India a waste free nation, with zero greenhouse gas emission and no health hazard. Under the initiative, a waste to wealth programme management centre will also be set up at IIT Delhi. 

The office of the PSA acts as a ‘think-tank’ and ‘action-tank’ for science, technology and innovation activities. The office plays a catalytic and synergistic role to strongly connect government ministry, academia and industry, to evolve relevant policies, make recommendations for the relevant scientific departments and ministries, and implement scientific interventions in various sectors of national priority. 

The Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) is one of the premiere educational and research institutions of India, offering a variety of world class bachelors, post graduate and research programs across multiple streams with an expert pool of 550 professors engaged in research important for the society and industry.

A.         Introduction


	Addressing job creation and issues related to employment-unemployment have been important priorities of the Government. Several Ministries,Departments and agencies collect and disseminate employment data in various forms in the country. Among the primary agencies involved in this activity are Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), Labour Bureau in Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) and the Registrar General & Census Commissioner of India in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). 



	In India, household based Employment-Unemployment Surveysareconducted by the NSS under MoSPI, the Annual Labour Force Survey by MoLE and the Population Census by Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner.The Employment-Unemployment Survey (EUS) is a comprehensive household survey providing labour force statistics in India. It was first conducted in the 9thround of the National Sample Survey (NSS) in 1955. The current format of quinquennial surveys started in the 27thround in 1972-73, based on M.L. Dantwala committee report. Since then, 8 quinquennial surveys have been conducted with the last one conducted during 2011-12. The EUS is carried out over a period of 12 months to account for seasonal variations in employment.
	Recognizing India’s evolving economy and requirements, it was decided to make a few changes with respect to availability of household data on employment-unemployment. The first was to conduct household surveys on an annual basis;secondly introduce a time-use survey to assess the time disposition of household members; and thirdly, introduce the use of technology that can speed up data collection and processing to reduce the time lags.
	India,having subscribedto the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the IMF since 1996, has had recourse to ""as relevant"" flexibility of the SDDS for the labour market data category which was available only once in 5 years. It is also important that the labour force data not only provides inputs to national policy but also remains internationally comparable. Further, considering the kind of quarterly data that the SDDS proposeson labour market (employment, unemployment and wages/earnings) using the concepts, definitions and classifications of International Labour Organisation (ILO), it was essential to put in place a system which could generate employment data to meet not only national requirements but also some of the requirements of IMF’s SDDS.
	Considering the need for availability of labour force statistics at more frequent intervals, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation had launched the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) during 2017-18, with the objective of measuring quarterly changes of various statistical indicators of the labour market in urban areas as well as generating the annual estimates of different labour force indicators both in rural and urban areas. Households in urban areas were visited four times, constituting a rolling panel for 3 quarters. This facilitates analysis of the changes in seasonal employment and employment characteristics in urban areas.


B.         Sample Design of PLFS


	A rotational panel sampling design has been used in urban areas. In this rotational panel scheme, each selected household in urban areas is visited four times, in the beginning with First Visit schedule and thrice periodically later with a Revisit schedule. In urban area, samples for a panel within each stratum were drawn in the form of two independent sub-samples. The scheme of rotation ensures that 75% of the first-stage sampling units (FSUs)[1] are matched between two consecutive visits. There was no revisit in the rural samples. For rural areas, samples for a stratum/sub-stratum were drawn randomly in the form of two independent sub-samples. For rural areas, in each quarter of the survey period, 25% FSUs of annual allocation were covered.A rotating panel design is a survey sampling strategy used by National Statistical Offices when estimates are required regularly over time. Under such a design, equally sized sets of sampling units are brought in and out of the sample in a pre-specified pattern. These sets, often called rotation groups, may be composed of households, business firms, or other units of interest to the survey. Rotating panel designs are used to reduce the variances of estimators of change parameters and often to reduce the survey costs associated with introducing a new unit into the sample.
	The PLFS has also used a rotational panel design in urban areasto measure quarterly changes of various statistical indicators of the labour market. Annual estimates of different labour force indicators were generated based on the first visit schedule in both rural and urban areas.
	The first Annual Report is based on the data collected in PLFS during July 2017- June 2018. It presents estimates pertaining to various aspects of employment and unemployment at National and State levels. The Quarterly Bulletin is presented for the quarter ending December 2018 which contains key employment and unemployment indicators in urban areas only.


C.         Sampling method


	Sample Size for First Visit during July 2017- June 2018 in rural and urban areas for the Annual Report: Out of the total number of 12,800 FSUs {7,024 villages and 5,776 Urban Frame Survey (UFS) blocks} allotted for the survey at the all-India level during July 2017- June 2018, 12,773 FSUs (7,014 villages and 5,759 urban blocks) could be surveyed for canvassing the PLFS schedule (Schedule 10.4). The number of households surveyed was 1,02,113 (56,108 in rural areas and 46,005 in urban areas) and number of persons surveyed was 4,33,339 (2,46,809 in rural areas and 1,86,530 in urban areas). All the labour force indicators in the Annual Reportare estimated on the basis of the data collected in the first visit Schedule, in both rural and urban areas,except earnings from employment, hours worked and hoursavailable for additional work.


 


	Sample Size in urban areas in each quarter of the survey period July 2017- June 2018: In urban areas, a rotational panel sampling design was used, as explained earlier. In rural areas there was only one visit. The data collected in the First Visit and Revisit Schedules during the survey period (July 2017-June 2018) were used to generate estimates of earnings from employment, hours work and hours available for additional work.


D.         Quarterly Bulletin

 


	The Quarterly Bulletin contains estimates for urban areas for the quarters April- June 2018, July- September 2018 and October – December 2018. Sample sizes, during these three quarters, are as follows:

	Conceptual Framework of Key Employment and Unemployment Indicators: The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) gives estimates of Key employment and unemployment Indicators like theLabour Force Participation Rates (LFPR), Worker Population Ratio (WPR), Proportion Unemployed (PU) and Unemployment Rate (UR). These indicators are defined as follows:


 


	Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR): LFPR is defined as the percentage ofpersons in labour force (i.e. working or seeking or available for work)in the population.


 


	Worker Population Ratio (WPR): WPR is defined as the percentage of employed personsin the population.


 


	Proportion Unemployed (PU): It is defined as the percentage of persons unemployed inthe population.


 


	Unemployment Rate (UR): UR is defined as the percentage of persons unemployedamong the persons in the labour force.


 


	Activity Status- Usual Status: The activity status of a person is determined on the basis of the activities pursued by the person during the specified reference period. When the activity status is determined on the basis of the reference period of last 365 days preceding the date of survey, it is known as the usual activity status of the person. 


 


	Activity Status- Current Weekly Status (CWS): The activity status determined on the basis of a reference period of last 7 days preceding the date of survey is known as the current weekly status (CWS) of the person.


 


	The EUS conducted till 2011-12 used the monthly per capita expenditure of the household in the selected blocks as a basis for stratification of households; and out of 8 households in the selected blocks, 75% were from the middle income group or above in the urban areas. In the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted from 2017-18, a decision was taken to use education levels as a criterion for stratification at the ultimate level. This has been incorporated in the sampling design of PLFS, where out of 8 households selected in the sample, 75% had at least 1 member with 10thstandard education or above.The rationale for this decision was based on the fact that the education levels in the economy have risen due to various policy interventions like the Right to Education Act etc. and it would be important to assess the level of employment and unemployment using this as a stratification basis. 


 


	The Standing Committee on Labour Force Statistics has noted these differences and included an Explanatory Note in the Annual Report of PLFS to sensitise users of these changes while making comparisons with the results of earlier Employment and Unemployment Surveys. Thus the PLFS provides a new metric for measurement of employment and unemployment.

	The usage of technology is another intervention introduced in the PLFS for the first time by NSS. Data under socio-economic surveys of National Sample Survey are traditionally collected from the field by using paper schedules and after the completion of data collection work it takes about a year to make available the results of the survey. NSSadapted the World Bank Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) solution platform with appropriate inputs for the PLFS. Data for the PLFS was collected in the field using Tablets and the CAPI solution with an in-built data validation process. This proved useful in the collection of primary data from the households, a reduced time for data transfer and processing of the survey results. Implementation of online data entry system in NSS wasa challenge that was effectively managed through close monitoring. NSShad intense and elaborate discussions with the World Bank Team andthe National Informatics Centre (NIC), New Delhi starting from the audit of the various versions of the CAPI module to the data processing and tabulation. A series of meetings were held and continuous communication through e-mail/ telephone/video conferencing (VC) was conducted for ensuring successful operations. 



	The experience of using the CAPI solution for the field functionaries of the NSS was also unique. The Field Operations Division of NSS engaged around 700 personnel namely, Field Investigators (FI)/Field Officers (FO) besides, the regular manpower to work upon CAPI in PLFS. These manpower resources were trained for a uniform understanding to ensure correct implementation of concepts and definitions while collecting data.


F.         Way Forward


	The PLFS needs to be seen as a new series for measuring employment and unemployment on an annual basis. It is important to note that with the rise in education levels in the economy and rise in household income levels, the aspiration levels of educated youth have also risen. Thus they may no longer be willing to join the labour force or work force requiring low skills and low remuneration. The PLFS results give the distribution of educated and unemployed persons across the country which can be used as a basis for skilling of youth to make them more employable by industry.  



	As brought out earlier, there are various facets to the employment and unemployment scenario and no single data source is complete by itself. These data sets need to be supplemented by data from other sources so as to collectively give a holistic picture of the overall employment market. In this direction, the Ministry has been bringing out a compilation of new subscribers to EPFO, ESIC and NPS to give an assessment of changes in the formal employmentmarket. The PLFS survey data complemented by administrative data and data from other sources need to be triangulated to get a complete picture. The Ministry encourages the research community and academia to take up this task and give additional insight to the labour market to the public at large.

Note: *(ps+ss) = (principal activity status + subsidiary economic activity status)

Principal activity status- The activity status on which a person spent relatively long time (major time criterion) during 365 days preceding the date of survey, was considered the usual principal activity status of the person. 

Subsidiary economic activity status- The activity status in which a person in addition to his/her usual principal status,performssome economic activity for 30 days or more for the reference period of 365 days preceding the date of survey, was considered the subsidiary economic status of the person.

                This press release is being issued to clarify on the recent media reports covering the internal restructuring of MoSPI. The National Statistical Commission, under the Chairpersonship of Dr. C. Rangarajan, had, inter-alia, recommended for the creation of National Statistical Office (NSO) to be headed by a National Statistician, with appropriate autonomy and independence for producing Official Statistics as is prevalent in other countries. The Government, while accepting the recommendations, had approved the establishment of NSO to be headed by Chief Statistician of India by merging the then Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) and National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) to form the NSOin May, 2005. The NSO was in existence since then to serve as the executive wing of the Government in the field of statistics, andthe Chief Statistician of India (CSI) & Secretary was itssole functionary. In the restructuring exercise, the administrative, coordination and planning activities of MoSPIhave also been brought into NSO, which continues to be headed by CSI & Secretary, for providing requisiteadministrative support to the statistical activities ofMoSPI.

2.         The internal restructuring exercise was undertaken with a view to have greater synergies amongst the available statistical manpower and improve data quality not only for survey data but also for administrative statistics.To monitor India’s progress in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, MoSPI has formulated a National Indicator Framework which requires significant data to flow from the field formations and requires extensive use of technology. This requires active and continuous involvement of State Governments, and the field presence of NSS in the States, with their knowledge and experience of official statistics system,can play a proactive role in this process,in addition to their existing functions. In the ongoingSeventh Economic Census, the field officersof Field Operations Division, NSSare playing a prominent role in the supervision of data collection from households and enterprises. 

3.         The internal restructuring of MoSPI is to strengthen the national statistical system while maintaining its autonomy. The various divisions in MoSPI continue to perform their functions as before. Further, the role and status of National Statistical Commission (NSC) remains unaltered and it continues to have the overall responsibility for providing strategic direction and leadership to the national statistical system in MoSPI, line Ministries and State Governments. 

4.         The Ministry also remains committed to making available official statistics and reports to various users. In fact, MoSPI has revised its guidelines for statistical data dissemination and data are now being made available to all users, free of cost.

                1. This press release is being issued to clarify on the recent media reports on the usage of corporate sector database (Ministry of Corporate Affairs, MCA) in preparation of the National Accounts estimates and the key findings in the Technical Report of the 74th NSS Round released recently. 

2.  It may be recalled that in the 2004-05 series of National Accounts, the RBI sample study of 2500 companies was being used to prepare estimate of Gross Value Added, savings etc. for the Private Corporate Sector (PCS). The Paid-Up-Capital (PUC) of this sample was used for scaling-up for the PUC of all companies for the activity. This methodology had limitations, which were duly considered by the Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS) while revising the Base Year of National Accounts to 2011-12. A Sub-Committee, constituted under the ACNAS, recommended the use of MCA-21 corporate database and a copy of the reports is at 

http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/ publication_reports/final_Report_Goldar_subcommittee2mar15.pdf. Accordingly, it was decided to use a PUC-based scientific blowing-up of the available companies’ results to arrive at the overall estimates and be used at all stages after the 1st revised estimates stage. This approach duly accounted for the companies that were active and may not have filed their returns at the time of release of National Accounts estimates. Such scaling-up, using appropriate sampling techniques, is a standard estimation procedure in all sample surveys. 

3.   The Ministry had decided to undertake an Annual Survey of Services Sector from 2019-20, to study their spatial and temporal characteristics for use in National Accounts estimates. As a prelude, the 74th NSS Round was conducted during July 2016-June 2017, using list frame of establishments/enterprises from multiple sources. In this round, NSS had selected 35,456 companies from the 3,49,500 service sector companies from MCA frame/database referenced in 2013-14.From the key findings of the Technical Report of NSS 74th round survey, it emerged that 16.4% of the companies registered with MCA were non-traceable or closed and 21.4% misclassified on the ground. 

 

4.   As has been brought out on earlier occasions, the results of any survey needs to be appreciated in the context with which it was undertaken. The objective of the 74th Round survey was to study the characteristics of the units engaged in the service sector, so as to evolve robust rates and ratios with regard to the output and input of various services. It may also be appreciated that when a corporate gets registered under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA-21), it receives a Corporate Identification Number (CIN) which has its broad economic activity embedded in the CIN based on the National Industrial Classification (NIC) code. Thus a corporate may have a CIN based on the NIC code at the time of registration, but may actually be carrying out an economic activity with a different NIC Code. Very few corporates make efforts to have their CIN updated with the latest NIC Code and this may lead to cases of mismatch of economic activity in the field vis-à-vis the NIC Code embedded in the CIN. In addition, several corporates cease to operate and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has been undertaking a weeding out exercise. In the last few years, nearly 6.3 lakh entities have been de-registered.

 

5. The NSS Technical Report of the 74th NSS Round needs to be understood in this backdrop. The NSS had taken a sample of 35,456 companies (reference base 2013-14) and visited these corporates. The companies that were not working in the services sector, based on their CIN were excluded from the scope of study and categorised as “out of survey”. This does not imply that these corporates did not exist. 

 

6.  As the key findings of the 74th NSS Round is to be used as a basis for further work, an exercise was undertaken in collaboration with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on the status of filings of the 35,456 corporates included in the sample. The status of the annual filing under MGT7 for 2016-17 for the sample is tabulated below:

Note:* consists of  status such as ‘amalgamated’, ‘converted’, ‘unclassified’, ‘under process’, ‘under liquidation’, ‘dissolved’, ‘dormant’ etc.

 

7. It may be seen from Table 1 above, from the 35,456 companies included in the 74th Round, around 34,834(86.5%) companies had filed their returns in the MCA database and only 622 were untraceable in MCA, perhaps due to change of CIN etc. In the context of GVA estimation in respect of private corporate sector (PCS), out of the 4,235 units categorised as not traceable at the given address in the 74th Round, around 3,154units had actually filed returns on-line on the MCA portal. Similarly, out of the 7,573 companies categorised out-of-coverage (i.e. not engaged in production of any service), 6,767 had filed returns on-line. From the 2,428 companies categorised as casualty (i.e. which did not supply information when approached by NSS surveyors), 1,854 companies had filed returns on-line. Interestingly, out of the 19,317 companies actually surveyed in 74th Round, returns had been filed by 17,668 (91.5%) companies. 

 

8. It may thus be noted that the filing of returns by corporates with MCA is a continuous process. For the purposes of National Accounts Estimates, the returns actually filed by the corporates under MCA is duly taken into account and the scaling up factor for the Paid-Up-Capital for the non-response is low. The key findings of this NSS survey gives a better insight on the challenges that will be faced when the Annual Survey of Services Sector is launched and assist in designing strategies to address them and improve quality. It is, however, reiterated that the findings of the NSS 74th Round survey will have insignificant impact on the National Accounts estimates.

                Reports have appeared in a section of the media regarding the usage of data, revisions in the estimates of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and associated indicators including the GDP Back-Series which require a clarification on behalf of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation on the following accounts-

*The estimation of GDP in any economy is a complex exercise where several measures and metrics are evolved to better measure the performance of the economy. For the purpose of global standardization and comparability, countries follow the System of National Accounts evolved in the UN after elaborate consultation. The System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA) is the latest version of the international statistical standard for the national accounts, adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) in 2009 and is an update of the earlier 1993 SNA. The Inter-Secretariat Working Group on National Accounts (ISWGNA) was mandated to develop the 2008 SNA through intense discussions and consultation with member countries. India also participated in the deliberations of the Advisory Expert Group. In its adoption of the 2008 SNA the UNSC encouraged Member States, regional and sub-regional organizations to implement its recommendations and use it for the national and international reporting of national accounts statistics. 

*As with any international standard, the data requirements are immense and developing countries take time to evolve the various data sources before they can be aligned with the SNA requirements. In absence of data, alternate proxy sources or statistical surveys are used to estimate the contribution of various sectors to the GDP/GVA. The SNA also prescribes that the base year of the estimates may be revised at periodic intervals so that changes in the economic environment, advances in methodological research and the needs of users are appropriately captured. 

*With structural changes taking place in the economy, it is necessary to revise the base year of macroeconomic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Index of Industrial Production (IIP), Consumer Price Index (CPI) etc, periodically to ensure that indicators remain relevant and reflect the structural changes more realistically.   Such revisions not only use latest data from censuses and surveys, it also incorporates information from administrative data that have become robust over time.  In India, the Base Year of the GDP Series was revised from 2004-05 to 2011-12 and released on 30 January, 2015 after adaptation of the sources and methods in line with the SNA 2008. The methodology of compilation of macro aggregates is discussed in detail by the Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS) comprising experts from academia, National Statistical Commission, Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Ministries of Finance, Corporate Affairs, Agriculture, NITIAayog and selected State Governments. The ACNAS has a mandate to (i) review the data base and advise on data collection  for implementing the recommendations of the System of National Accounts-2008 (SNA-2008); (ii) advise on the methodology for compilation and presentation of National Accounts Statistics for purposes of economic analysis and policy and on promotion of research in the field of National Accounts Statistics; (iii) advise on undertaking studies for improvement of National Accounts Statistics in terms of coverage, adoption of new classifications and development of sequence of accounts for various institutional sectors. 

*This is to also reiterate that the detailed Sources and Methods for compilation of the national accounts statistics are placed on the website[1] of MOSPI under the heading “ Changes in Methodology and Data Sources in the New Series of National Accounts, Base Year 2011-12”. Similarly, the detailed methodology for the GDP Back-Series is available on the website[2] of the Ministry. 

*The 2011-12 series of National Accounts Statistics incorporates changes in data sources, expansion in coverage of activities and improvements in procedures that are aligned to the latest recommendations of UN System of National Accounts 2008, to the extent data is available. There has been an improved coverage of the financial corporations, local bodies and autonomous institutions, all of which have an impact on the estimates of Gross Value Added (GVA). The 2011-12 National Accounts Series also started using the corporate sector data available from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in its estimates. The issue of coverage, quality and timeliness of the MCA database vis-à-vis the Annual Survey of Industries had been discussed in detail in the various meetings of the Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics and adopted only thereafter. The recent exercise of the National Sample Survey to bring out a Technical Report on the Services Sector was commissioned by the Ministry to understand the data gaps and take remedial steps while undertaking the new base revision exercise for the proposed 2017-18 series. The results of this NSS Report will be further examined by the Advisory Committee before finalising the approach and methodology for the proposed 2017-18 series. It is emphasised that there is no impact on the existing GDP/GVA estimates for the corporate sector as due care is taken to appropriately adjust the corporate filings at the aggregate level based on the paid up capital.

*In fact, the Ministry is also embarking on the 7th Economic Census for all economic establishments with an aim to not only assess the nature and distribution of establishments but to also form a National Business Register which can be periodically updated. This will greatly facilitate future establishment surveys undertaken by the central and state governments. The field work for the Economic Census is slated to commence in June, 2019.

*India has also subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) of International Monetary Fund (IMF) which requires that macro-economic data would be disseminated within the prescribed periodicity and timeliness conforming to the data standards laid down along with information on the detailed statistical practices or metadata.  Accordingly, the Ministry has an Advance Release Calendar that gives the specific dates of release for the estimates. For instance, for the GDP/GVA estimates of 2018-19, the releases would be as indicated below:

*It needs to be appreciated that every revision in the estimates of GDP/GVA is based on the data available at the time of the respective release. The coverage and quality of each data source like Revenue expenditure, taxes, company filings data improves over time. Till the release of Provisional Estimates in any year, the estimates are based on indicators like the Index of Industrial production (IIP), wholesale price indices, core sector data on steel, cement, electricity, Revenue expenditure, GST data, trade data on imports & exports, consumer prices etc. The estimates based on indicators are reworked when the corresponding data source becomes available. By the time of the Third Revised Estimate, the coverage and completeness in the data sources are almost final and no further revision takes place. Usually no revisions in the estimates take place beyond the Advance Release Calendar. 

 

*According to the World Bank, the accuracy of national accounts estimates and their comparability across countries depend on timely revisions to data on GDP and its components. The frequency of revisions to GDP data across countries varies between monthly, quarterly, annually or even less frequently. It may also be mentioned that the Ministry had earlier decided to revise the Base Year of the GDP/GVA and IIP to 2017-18 and steps have been taken to expedite the revision exercise. As already mentioned, the Ministry adopts procedures that are in accordance with international standards and the detailed methodology for compilation of the GDP, including the Back Series is available on the website of the Ministry. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), through its technical missions also reviews the implementation of recommendations of SNA and provides necessary technical support. Further, under Article IV of IMF, a Mission, interacts annually with officials of Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, Reserve Bank of India and Ministry of Finance on issues relating to Economic developments and policies. IMF had raised certain concerns regarding the deflators used in the GDP estimates, especially the use of double deflation. In this context, it may be appreciated that the data requirements for using double deflation is immense and that only few countries like Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico and USA are presently using this methodology. This Ministry is working in close coordination with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for developing the required indices for using double deflator methodology in relevant sectors. MoSPI has separately taken up this issue with the IMF. It may also be noted that the National Accounts Division, which compiles these macro aggregates and other National Accounts Statistics is also ISO (International Organisation for Standards) 9001:2015 certified for its quality management of procedures and processes.

                The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on May 23, 2019 was 33.563 BCM, which is 21% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 22 for the week ending on May 16, 2019. The level of water storage in the week ending on May 23, 2019 was 114% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 104% of storage of average of last ten years. 

The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 161.993 BCM which is about 63% of the total storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.  

REGION WISE STORAGE STATUS:-

NORTHERN REGION

The northern region includes States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. There are six reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 18.01 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 7.93 BCM which is 44% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 15% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 26% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

EASTERN REGION

The Eastern region includes States of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Tripura. There are 15 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 18.83 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 4.56 BCM which is 24% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 28% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 22% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is less than the corresponding period of last year but is better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

WESTERN REGION

The Western region includes States of Gujarat and Maharashtra. There are 27 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 31.26 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 3.75 BCM which is 12% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 16% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 21% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is less than the storage of last year and is also less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

CENTRAL REGION

The Central region includes States of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. There are 12 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 42.30 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 10.96 BCM which is 26% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 24% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 22% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the storage of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

SOUTHERN REGION

The Southern region includes States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, AP&TG (Two combined projects in both states), Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There are 31 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 51.59 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 6.38 BCM which is 12% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 12% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 15% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is equal to the corresponding period of last year but is less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

States having better storage than last year for corresponding period are Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, AP&TG (Two combined projects in both states), Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. States having equal storage than last year for corresponding period are Uttar Pradesh and Telangana. States having lesser storage than last year for corresponding period are Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Tripura, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala.

                Shri U.P. Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation expressed concern that inspite of reports of water crisis in many parts of the country, water related issues have not got adequate space in our conversations and our concerns in society as whole. New developments in the field of tele-communication and automobile sector easily get our attention and find space in centre stage but water which is the source of all life forms and essential for many of our needs is still not a subject of our concern in society as a whole. Addressing the inaugural session of ‘Restoring Water, Restoring Nature-II’ organized by Water Digest in New Delhi today, he said that the quality of water is worsening due to industrial pollutants and new technologies have to be devised to maintain the quality of water to fulfil all our needs.

The conference was organized to raise awareness and encourage action around water and related issues. The main purpose was to create a platform to discuss and showcase the best concepts of water conservation and management in synchrony with the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDG). 

Shri Masood Husain, Chairman, Central Water Commission stressed the need of water management to fulfil our needs of drinking water, irrigation and industrial sector for entire population. He said that 80 percent of water is being used for agriculture and practices of micro irrigation, drip irrigation should be encouraged for efficient use of water. Civil society still do not understand all aspects of water crisis and mass awareness movement is required to educate masses. He further said that to check over exploitation of ground water, inter basin transfer of river water, micro irrigation techniques and recycle and reuse of water is the need of the hour.

Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, DG, NMCG said that we do not really care about our rivers in-spite of the fact that rivers are essential for our existence. We need to create awareness about aquatic life in rivers, biodiversity and flora and fauna in rivers so that these could become a subject of conversation in our households and we could adopt a more caring attitude towards our rivers.   

The conference was attended by around 150 participants from the industry, government bodies, development agencies and institutions. Three sessions along with panel discussion was organised on ‘Water for all: A platform to discuss available water resources, and the efforts needed to achieve SDG 6’; ‘Irrigation- Strategies to balance available resources and adapt technological innovativeness’; and ‘water tributary care about the rivers’.

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) celebrated its 10th Annual Day yesterday, i.e. on 20th May, 2019 which marks the notification of the substantive enforcement provisions of the Competition Act, 2002.

 

On this occasion, Shri N. K. Singh, Chairman, Fifteenth Finance Commission, Govt. of India, delivered the Annual Day Lecture on “Should Competitive Federalism Complement Cooperative Federalism?”

 

Shri N.K. Singh in his Introductory Remarks dwelt upon the scope, jurisdiction, mandate and duties of the Finance Commission in view of the Article 280 of the Constitution of India. He pointed that it is challenging to provide ideal distribution of tax revenues between Union and the States considering the peculiar issues involved with the States in terms of economic structure, demographic management and administrative mechanism. However, the Finance Commission will endeavour to reward efficiency while recognising equity, he said.

 

While appreciating the role of Competition Commission of India as a Market Regulator ensuring level playing field, he stated that in increased globalized and inter-dependent world, the role of the Competition Commission of India is required to be dynamic. He further underscored the fact that the globalized and inter-dependent world will draw more private investments and the State Governments can take advantage of that in their all-round progress. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) can also bring positive changes in the developments of the Sates in India and the Competition Commission of India can play a vital role in ensuring level playing field.

 

Shri Singh further underlined the necessity of having a Market Regulator as competition in markets ensures optimum utilization of resources and bring forth innovation at forefront. In view of rapid change in technology day by day, disruption in services and products have become a new norm in the markets and dynamic role of the Competition Commission of India is required for its regulation. He also highlighted the fact that the economic reforms in India so far, have largely focussed on the products market and it is now imperative to take it to the factor markets which includes reforms in labour and land laws and ensuring access to capitals.

 

Earlier, Shri Ashok Kumar Gupta, Chairman, Competition Commission of India, in his Welcome Address, stated that CCI is a young but perceptive regulator and has strived to nurture a culture of competition in markets through credible antitrust enforcement and regular engagement with the stakeholders. The Commission frequently solicits and takes cognizance of the stakeholders’ insights. Since 2009, the CCI has reviewed 1010 antitrust cases, 660 merger filings and has held more than 700 advocacy events.
