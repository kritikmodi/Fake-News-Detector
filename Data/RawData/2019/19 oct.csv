                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, launched Endowment Fund of Indian Institute Technology Delhi at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (October 31, 2019). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that endowments globally have become integral to the financial health of educational institutions over time. While we are still far from the size and importance of endowment funds of Institutions such as Harvard, Yale or Columbia, it is the right first step in this direction. By giving through endowments, alumni are not just giving to their institution but they are also supporting and nurturing future generations of learners.

The President said that the best way to honour a gift is to make the best use of it. In the latest QS World University ranking 2020, IIT Delhi was ranked at 182. There is a lot of scope for improvement if it aims to be one of the top institutes in the world. It needs to increase the number of faculty particularly faculty with international experience. Additionally, it needs to upgrade its infrastructure to ensure its campus, course content and research facilities are completely world class. He expressed hope the institute will make use of the valuable contribution from the alumni to bring changes in these areas.

The President said that throughout history our educational institutes have been the beacons of our culture. We have a tradition of universities showing the way for the people in society and enriching lives. He urged all to devote some amount of their time for the benefit of the not-so-fortunate sections of society by picking up any cause of their choice. He said that it can be the empowerment of the divyang, or rehabilitation of destitute women, or helping children in distress. The cause does not matter, only their will to make a difference does.

                A group of officer trainees of the Indian Information Service (2018 batch) called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (October 31, 2019) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Addressing the officer trainees, the President said that as officers of Indian Information Service, they play a versatile role in not only dissemination of information but also in checking its veracity and collating it for a meaningful purpose. In this era of dumbing down of information, they need to emerge as providers of positive information, that is, information which is useful and relevant for people and society. This is in addition to their role as Information Gate Keepers and Information Enablers. 

The President said that through public outreach and communication, IIS officers can educate people about different welfare schemes and policies. All of them have the skills and ability to make these welfare schemes and policies comprehensible, relevant, real and actionable for the people at the last mile. Thus, they play an important role in ensuring people’s participation which is most critical to the success of any programme. 

The President urged IIS officers to develop strong professional networks with the media community, so that they can disseminate correct information concerning issues of public importance and check misinformation. He said that by doing so they would be able to ensure that the government’s outreach and communication with people shall remain relevant, timely, practical and effective.

Addressing the probationers, the President said that boundaries of nations are opening up to greater economic cooperation. On the other hand, economic challenges are also making boundaries more crucial. IRS officers are going to be the guardians of our economic frontiers.

The President said that with the objective of making the country more self-reliant, the government has launched the Make in India initiative. IRS officers’ role with respect to it is that tax administrators should strive to provide an environment within which trade and industry can thrive. Their motto with respect to international trade should be: ‘Border divides, Customs connect’. This will help transform India to a 5 trillion dollar economy.

	I extend to all of you a warm welcome to Rashtrapati Bhavan. I am happy to meet you, the probationers of the Indian Revenue Service–Customs and Central Excise. I congratulate you on your success in a highly competitive examination, and subsequent selection to the all-important Revenue Service.



	Revenue of the state is the energy that fuels the running of the state. It is the very foundation of governance, and its importance cannot be overstated. 



	This is true not only of the modern state. We have a rich knowledge base on taxation. Chanakya’s Arthashastra has practical wisdom on the topic, and so does the Mahabharata. Chanakya says, “Taxation should not be a painful process for the people. There should be leniency and caution while deciding the tax structure. Ideally, the government should collect taxes like a honeybee which sucks just the right amount of honey from the flower so that both can survive.” Our great epic Mahabharata narrates how Yudhishthir went to Bhishma for advice on governance. The veteran statesman says, “No one likes to pay tax, but the king should make them aware of the national priorities for which funds are needed.” He also tells Yudhishthir that the king should ensure tax compliance. In our times, the state has to ensure compliance, and that is your job.



	The IRS offers tremendous opportunities to discharge your duties, be it as a tax administrator, a law enforcement official, a government pleader, a research analyst, a faculty member, or on any other critical assignments.
	I am told that you contribute nearly 47 percent of the total revenue to the government exchequer. Your contribution enables the country to spend resources for economic development and creation of various infrastructures, for a variety of socio-economic schemes, and for education and health services.



	With increasing globalisation coupled with the spread of the information technology, the world is changing fast. Boundaries of nations are opening up to greater economic cooperation. On the other hand, economic challenges are also making boundaries more crucial. You are going to be the guardians of our economic frontiers.
	Within those frontiers, with the objective of making the country more self-reliant, the government has launched the Make in India initiative. Your role with respect to it is that tax administrators should strive to provide an environment within which trade and industry can thrive. 



	Your motto with respect to international trade should be: ‘Border divides, Customs connect’. This will help transform India to a 5 trillion dollar economy. Just as customs connects the global trade fraternity, the GST connects the nation as one with one tax.



	GST is also a major economic reform which is in tune with the international tax administration regime. In implementation of the GST, you have the advantage of your age and a beginner’s mind set. Since you are in learning mode, I expect that you will look at current processes and persistent problems with fresh eyes, and come up with innovations and solutions. That will be a great service to the nation.



	Technology is, of course, an area where the young have an edge over the experienced. The government is making great use of technology to make tax collection more efficient and less intrusive. I am sure you will put your technology skills to good use and consolidate such initiatives.



	As you are about to begin your career, allow me to share a pertinent point with you. In various services of the government, the probationers make an extra effort to prove themselves. You try to be conscious about honesty and integrity and remain concerned about your commitment and dedication to people. You are invariably on alert against any errors. But once you get confirmed in the service, there is a risk of slackness and human weakness setting in, for asking small favours as a part of the privileges of the service. My advice to all of you is, you should never come out of the probationer’s mind set, maintain your integrity and honesty and guard against any laxity.



	I am confident that you will serve the nation as a disciplined officer but I also hope each of you will strive to become a good individual with high morals of whom the nation and family will be proud. I wish you all the very best for the future.


 

Thank you,

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the annual convocation of Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi today (October 30, 2019).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that government has been making changes in education eco-system to adapt it to contemporary challenges. One of the important objectives of the 'National Education Policy' proposed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development is to establish India as a 'knowledge super power'. The whole world is aware of the immense talent of the students of India. All educational institutions in the country have to contribute to make proper use of this talent. Special contributions are expected from prestigious institutions like 'Jamia'.

The President said that in order to connect every section of the society with development, University’s Social Responsibility (USR) like Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) needs to be emphasized. He noted that Jamia has adopted five villages under the ‘Unnat Bharat Abhiyan’. He asked Jamia if it can adopt some more villages. He said that while working for this campaign, students should go to those villages and try to understand their issues. They should make villagers aware of the schemes like cleanliness of the village, literacy, vaccination of all children and nutrition. He said that students should also provide villagers information about Central and State Government schemes. Such efforts would help the weaker sections of the society and increase students' awareness and sensitivity towards rural areas, the President pointed out. 

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, Union Minister for Human Resource Development and Dr Najma Heptualla, Governor of Manipur and Chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Rule of Law is the cornerstone of the modern state; and as an enforcer of law, the Indian Police Service has a vital role to play. The entire spectrum of governance stems from Rule of Law. It has paramount importance especially in a democratic polity, where it ensures that all citizens are indeed equal. Indian Police Officers’ task ahead, then, is to enforce the law and thus uphold the very principles of democracy.

The President said that given the great responsibility on the IPS Officers’ shoulders, it is natural that people associate authority and aura with the uniformed service. He expressed confidence that they will leverage this honour for the IPS in society to check the misuse of law and instil a sense of security in the common man, while also respecting human rights of all. He said that the nation also expects their sincere commitment and professionalism to meet the challenges of internal security posed by the emergent threats of terrorism, extremism and insurgency.

	I am happy to welcome all of you, the officer trainees of the Indian Police Service, to Rashtrapati Bhavan. I also congratulate you on your success in the highly competitive examination and your selection in the Indian Police Service.



	Rule of Law is the cornerstone of the modern state; and as an enforcer of law, the Indian Police Service has a vital role to play. The entire spectrum of governance stems from Rule of Law. It has paramount importance especially in a democratic polity, where it ensures that all citizens are indeed equal. Your task ahead, then, is to enforce the law and thus uphold the very principles of democracy. It is not a small responsibility. I am confident that as All-India Service officers, wherever you serve, you will strive to serve fellow citizens of the country.



	The best way to serve the fellow citizens is by scrupulous adherence to the salient principles enshrined in the Constitution in rendering service to one and all. For this noble purpose, you will surely harness energies and competencies with a vision to work relentlessly for the public.



	When you ensure timely hearing and redressal of public grievances judiciously, you will also feel great satisfaction. It will help to be extra-sensitive to citizens’ needs and expectations. When it comes to issues concerning women, children, the poor, and vulnerable sections of society, empathy and sensitivity will be all the more necessary.



	Given the great responsibility on your shoulders, it is natural that people associate authority and aura with the uniformed service. I am sure you will leverage this honour for the IPS in society to check the misuse of law and instil a sense of security in the common man, while also respecting human rights of all.



	Moreover, the nation expects your sincere commitment and professionalism to meet the challenges of internal security posed by the emergent threats of terrorism, extremism and insurgency.



	We are living in the digital age, and technology is being put to use to ensure better and efficient service delivery by the police. You will be expected to use technology innovatively and serve the citizens even better.



	I am confident that the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA) has inculcated in you not only the necessary skills for the tasks ahead but also the values like courage, uprightness, and dedication. With that learning, you will uphold, practise and propagate the highest standards of integrity and transparency in administration.



	As you begin your service, I have a word of advice for you. As probationers, you have been invariably on alert against any errors. You remain alive to the need for honesty and remain concerned about dedication to people. When confirmed in the service, however, you run the risk of the human weaknesses. That is when, in some cases, values start getting diluted. I advise you to guard against it. You should stick fast to the probationer’s mindset, and remain ever alert and honest in the service of the nation.


 

Thank you.

	First of all, let me compliment the Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister and her team for this initiative to recognize excellence in CSR through National Awards. I congratulate all winners and those who have found honourable mentions in the various categories of the National CSR Awards. I commend the whole corporate sector for its contributions towards society over and above creation of wealth and jobs. It is heartening to see companies competing in good deeds.


 


	The term ‘CSR’ is a recent coinage, but the spirit behind it has a long history in our land. All religious traditions that flourished here propagated the कर्म-सिद्धान्त, that is, Theory of Karma. For us, this principle of Karma is in consonance with the principles of nature that nurture harmony and peace. In India, every child has heard inspiring tales of legendary greats like ‘daanveer’ Karna, known for his generosity. Thus, what is now called CSR is very much in our DNA. 


 


	The legacy was carried forward by entrepreneurs of early industrialism. Illustrious business families like Tata, Birla and Bajaj and many others associated with our freedom struggle were sensitive to their social responsibilities. Mahatma Gandhi developed the principle of trusteeship, not only from his deep understanding of our various religious traditions, but also on the basis of the generosity of industrialists associated with him.


 


	It is befitting that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs is launching the National CSR Awards in this year of Gandhiji’s 150th birth anniversary. I am happy to learn that henceforth these Awards will be conferred every year on October 2, the Mahatma’s birth anniversary. Gandhiji found the seeds of the principle of trusteeship especially in the Ishavasya Upanishad and the Bhagavad Gita. The Gita offers this advice on the best way of giving:


 

दातव्यमिति यद्दानं दीयतेऽनुपकारिणे |

देशे काले च पात्रे च तद्दानं सात्विकं स्मृतम् | [Chapter 17, verse 20]

It means:

“Charity, given as a matter of duty, without expectation of any return, at the right place and time, and to the right person is said to be sattvika.”

 


	After independence, more and more business families and industries started following Gandhiji’s advice and returned a part of their profits to society, when the nascent republic needed all help. They complemented the efforts of the government and the public sector, especially in education and healthcare.


 


	In order to build on our rich tradition of CSR and to engage the whole of corporate India as agents of social transformation, a policy was brought in. The Companies Act was amended in 2013-14, making it mandatory for companies with a specified level of profit to spend two percent of it on social welfare. I am told it is one of the world’s largest experiments in promoting CSR.


 


	During this early phase of implementation, the response of companies to the CSR framework has been highly commendable. Every fiscal year since 2014-15, the corporate sector has set aside a total of more than Rs 10,000 crore for social welfare. A diverse range of social sectors have benefitted from this effort. I am especially glad to see among them education, environment, health, poverty eradication and nutrition, safe drinking water, and sanitation.


 


	The National CSR Awards aim to encourage competition and infuse excellence in CSR activities. The three categories for the awards are well chosen – excellence in CSR, contribution of CSR in challenging circumstances/ aspirational districts and contribution of CSR in National Priority Areas. The ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ has been a policy priority of the government. Under this innovative programme, 131 districts have been selected for a more focused development initiative. I am glad that the Awards recognize the exemplary CSR work done in these Aspirational Districts. I am also happy to see that the winners and honourable mentions of National CSR Awards represent the full diversity of industry sectors as well as regions.


 


	It is indeed heartening to note that those sections of society that need the helping hand most are among the main beneficiaries of the CSR activities. The corporations have, thus, made a worthy contribution towards the national goals. They are helping the nation progress towards the cherished goal of building a more equitable society. They have focused on sustainable projects creating a long-term impact. 


 


	Broadly, CSR initiatives have been aligned with the national priorities such as public health, education, livelihoods, water conservation, sanitation, and natural resource management. They are also in tune with the global priorities. I am referring here to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all. The 17 goals with 169 targets are to be achieved by 2030. I am confident that we will achieve all targets well in time. In fact, on the parameter of sanitation, India has achieved the target far ahead of the time. The advent of an effective CSR regime is indeed a timely development in this context. I sincerely hope that innovative solutions to persisting development challenges will emerge from the CSR activities.


 


	As you all are aware, India has been consistently improving its rank among the nations on the ease of doing business thanks to the efforts of our government. The government is also sensitive about the need to calibrate the CSR regime to make it more effective. In September, the scope of the CSR activities was widened to include more categories of research incubators. This thrust on research and development will immensely help innovators. 


 


	It is equally important to internalise social welfare in the corporate culture. Hence I will also urge upon you to motivate your employees and sensitise them to this higher calling in service of the marginalised sections of society. This single step will generate enough goodwill for wealth creators among ordinary people.


 


	 On this occasion, I want to share a vision I have with you. When it comes to helping those in the need in our society, we have the resources, we have the will and now we have a framework too. Whom shall we help most? I have in my mind orphan children and Divyang. While the government has done what it can to give them a helping hand, society and especially the corporate sector can still do more for them. Can we plan in such a way that within a foreseeable future, every orphan child can get personal care? We can set 2030 as a deadline to ensure providing care to every child and reap the benefits of demographic advantage that we have. I leave this suggestion to you as food for thought and action.


 


	It is my pleasure to participate in the celebrations of the First National CSR Awards. I once again congratulate all award winners and those who have achieved honourable mentions as well as the jury and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. You all have shown that it is possible to be profitable, while being socially and environmentally responsible. Standing before you here today, I see ancient sages were right when they said:


 

गौरवं प्राप्यते दानात् न तु वित्तस्य सञ्चयात्

स्थितिरुच्चैः पयोदानां पयोधीनामधः स्थितिः

It means:

“Respect is achieved by donating the wealth, and not by storing it. Clouds attain a higher position by giving away water whereas the oceans remain at a lower position by storing water.”

 

May you occupy even higher positions and inspire others too! I wish the very best in your endeavours ahead.

 

Thank you,

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the commemoration of Golden Jubilee of Vishwa Shanti Stupa in Rajgir, Bihar today (October 25, 2019).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Vishwa Shanti Stupa is a symbol of unity, peace and non-violence. Its message has universal resonance, which rises above cultures, religions and geographies. It also reflects the abiding partnership and extensive cooperation between the peace-loving democracies of Japan and India.

The President said that the Buddha’s eight-fold-path not only transformed the spiritual landscape worldwide but also encouraged ethical and sustainable social, political and commercial practices. The appeal of Buddha goes far beyond the 500 million followers of Buddhism worldwide. The President said that there is a need to connect increasingly larger number of people with the ideals of the Buddha. Promoting heritage tourism in places related to the Buddha is an effective way of attracting people, especially the youth to the spirit of Buddhism.

The President said that peace is a necessary precondition to development. The essence of Buddha’s preaching emphasised peace within as precondition to attain peace outside. Spirituality, peace and development reinforce each other. Conflict, turmoil and under development feed upon each other. He urged the participants to promote peace and harmony as potent means to reduce poverty and conflict.

1.           I am immensely happy to be here on this auspicious occasion of commemorating the Golden Jubilee of ‘Vishwa Shanti Stupa’, built at this ancient Buddhist site. I congratulate the Government of Bihar, Rajgir Buddha Vihar Society, followers of Nipponzan Myohoji and disciples of Most Venerable Fujii Guruji for this celebration. My special appreciation for the delegates from different parts of Asia, Europe and America particularly from Japan who have travelled to this holy site for the anniversary. You all are ambassadors of World Peace.

 

2.           I feel fortunate standing here on Ratnagiri Hill, facing the Vulture Peak, from where Lord Buddha is said to have preached the Lotus Sutra for seven years. I had the privilege of participating in the anniversary celebrations of this Peace Pagoda in 2015 and 2016, as Governor of Bihar. I was also the Chief Patron of Rajgir Buddha Vihar Society. I came to Rajgir in 2018 to inaugurate the ‘International Conference on Dharma-Dhamma’. Every visit to Rajgir, one of the favourite abodes of the Buddha, fills me with special joy.

 

3.           We have assembled in a sacred land of spiritual revolutions that transformed societies. Bodh Gaya, Rajgir, Pataliputra and Nalanda are the birth-places of these changes that took place several centuries ago and spread across the world. Not far from this place, Lord Buddha attained enlightenment under a tree at Bodh Gaya. Jainism and Hinduism took deep roots in this region which underlines the amazing diversity thriving in our country since ancient times.

 

4.           Therefore the ‘Vishwa Shanti Stupa’ is a symbol of unity, peace and non-violence. Its message has universal resonance, which rises above cultures, religions and geographies. It also reflects the abiding partnership and extensive cooperation between the peace-loving democracies of Japan and India. This ceremony is happening in a period marked by significant increase in mutual engagement between our countries within the Kyoto-Kashi spirit.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

5.           My great predecessor, the Late Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, had laid the foundation stone of this Stupa in 1965. It was inaugurated by my another illustrious predecessor, the Late V. V. Giri, in the Gandhi Centenary Year of 1969. As we all know, Mahatma Gandhi followed Maha-Karunik Buddha’s ideals of universal love and compassion. Buddha’s teachings find reflection in Gandhian ethos. I am happy that in this month of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we have assembled here to mark the 50th year of this Vishwa Shanti Stupa. Thus, while commemorating the Golden Jubilee of the Stupa, we are also paying homage to the greatest missionary of peace in the modern world. 

 

6.           It is well known that Fujii Guruji initiated the idea of building Shanti Stupas across the world. This impressive Stupa is primarily a result of Fujii Guruji’s untiring efforts and the fine work of renowned Buddhist architect and artist Upendra Maharathi. Fujii Guruji met Gandhiji and also stayed at the Wardha ashram. Gandhiji and Guriji were two great souls bound by one common goal of promoting non-violence and peace. Such was the impact of Nichiren Buddhism of Japan on Gandhiji that he learnt the chant ‘Namyo Ho Renge kyo’ and his prayer sessions would begin with the chant. I have just returned from a visit to Japan. During the visit, on October 21, I also met a delegation from Gotemba Peace Foundation set up by Fujii Guruji.

 

7.           I had had the privilege of meeting Fujii Guruji about 45 years ago. I still remember that evening, probably it was in the year 1974, when he entered the New Delhi residence of the late Morarji Desai, chanting and beating drums with his disciples and Morarjibhai welcomed them with folded hands. Fujii Guruji, a Buddhist monk, and Morarji Desai, a follower of the Hindu way of life and worship called Sanatan Dharma, were bound together by their common spiritual goal – World Peace. I had the privilege of working with Morarji Desai who was the Prime Minister of India from 1977 to 1979. 

 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

8.           The influence of Buddhist ideals and symbols on our democracy is both profound and visible. We have adopted the Lion Capital of Ashoka as our national emblem. In the lower house of our Parliament, called Lok Sabha, above the chair of the Speaker are inscribed the words, “Dharma Chakra Pravartanay”, which means ‘setting in motion the wheel of Dhamma or righteousness’. The chief architect of our Constitution, Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, highlighted the debt our parliamentary democracy owes to ancient Buddhist Sanghas.

 

9.           The messages and followers of the Buddha spread across much of Asia in ancient times. They paved the way for one of the earliest waves of globalization. The Buddha’s eight-fold-path not only transformed the spiritual landscape worldwide but also encouraged ethical and sustainable social, political and commercial practices. Later, Buddhism spread to other continents also. Its emphasis on compassion, equality, moderation and non-violence presented in a rational manner attracts the modern mind. The appeal of Buddha goes far beyond the 500 million followers of Buddhism worldwide. Taking forward the essential spirit of the Budda’s path, Mahatma Gandhi influenced leaders and people across continents to emerge as a global icon. Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi preached unity of thought, action and spoken word, and showed us our innate potential for goodness. Their own lives became their message. In the timeless teachings of Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi can be found solutions to the fundamental problems facing an individual, a community, a country and the entire world.

 

10.       There is a need to connect increasingly larger number of people with the ideals of the Buddha. Promoting heritage tourism in places related to The Buddha is an effective way of attracting people, especially the youth to the spirit of Buddhism. I am told that Japanese entities are providing assistance to the development of Buddhist Circuit. The Union Ministry of Tourism and the State Government of Bihar are cooperating with the International Finance Corporation on an integrated Buddhist Circuit Tourism Development Project. With these efforts at providing better connectivity and facilities, the quality of services for visitors will continue to improve.

 

11.       Lord Buddha had said, ‘Natthi santiparam sukham’ which means ‘there is no bliss greater than peace’. Peace is a necessary pre-condition to development. The essence of Buddha’s preaching emphasised peace within as precondition to attain peace outside. Spirituality, peace and development reinforce each other. Conflict, turmoil and under development feed upon each other. The solemn objective of every participant in today’s function should be to promote peace and harmony as potent means to reduce poverty and conflict. 

 

12.       From Buddha to Gandhi, the ‘Light of Asia’ has shown the right path to the world. I am sure that it will continue to brighten our pathways to a future full of peace, harmony and prosperity.

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind laid the foundation stone for Sri Sathya Sai Sanathana Samskruti Project at Sai no Sato, Kakegawa, Japan today (October 23, 2019). Sai no Sato will be developed as a temple on the lines of Akshardham and Swaminarayan Temple to promote Indian traditional culture.  

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in today’s world, where we are searching for inner peace and happiness, looking to bring communities and cultures together, places like Sai no Sato provide us the right answers. We need not just one but many more such fonts of peaceful existence, where women and men can contemplate about self and society, individual and community and eliminate the distance between “us and them”. 

In the evening, the President also attended a banquet hosted in his honour by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. 

         Later in the night, the President will embark his return journey and expected to reach New Delhi in the early morning of October 24, 2019.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind reached Tokyo, Japan, yesterday (October 21, 2019) in the final leg of his visit to two nations - Philippines and Japan. 

Today (October 22, 2019), the President attended the enthronement ceremony of the Emperor Naruhito of Japan in the Imperial Palace. 

On the sideline of the enthronement ceremony, the President met President Bidya Devi Bhandari of Nepal.  During the discussions, the President said that continuously expanding and strengthening partnership with Nepal is a priority for our government. It is in consonance with India’s vision to promote economic growth and prosperity in the neighbourhood. He said that India values its development partnership with Nepal. India is committed to support Nepal in its economic growth and development as per the priorities set by the Government of Nepal. 

Later in the evening, the President addressed the members of Indian diaspora in Tokyo at a reception hosted by Shri Sanjay Kumar Verma, Ambassador of India to Japan. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India is on a transformational path.  Our economy is growing at a fast rate. We are creating new infrastructure apace.  We are making efforts to lead the world on digital economy, on new technologies, on climate change action and on fashioning the contours of the knowledge society. India offers immense opportunities for Indian Diaspora to participate in our progress and prosperity. He said that India seeks their support and commitment to create an India of our vision and dream, an India that promises to light millions of homes with progress and prosperity; an India that cares for one and for all.  

The President said that our cultural relations with Japan are deep and historic. We share spiritual and religious connections, from Buddhism to Hinduism and more.  Our strategic, political, security and economic collaboration has assumed a new high. Japan is a lead partner for us in transforming our economy. Their participation in the High Speed Rail project from Mumbai to Ahmedabad is a symbol of our deep mutual trust and friendship. To deepen our technology collaboration, we have established the India-Japan Digital Partnership. 

Yesterday (October 21, 2019), the President visited the Tsukiji Hongwanji Buddhist Temple and planted a sapling from Bodh Gaya.  He also visited the Shinto Meiji Shrine and interacted with a delegation from the Gotemba Pagoda.

                1.      I am delighted to be visiting the Philippines.  Our ties with your country and your people are not just special, but one that we keep very close to our hearts. It is a friendship that we celebrate and cherish always.  

2.      This year the world celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of the Indian Nation, the apostle of peace and non-violence, Mahatma Gandhi.  Today, I feel honoured to unveil his bust in the Philippines – the land of the brave Jose Rizal. I thank Miriam College for giving a place of respect to Mahatma Gandhi in its campus.  Both Mahatma Gandhi and Jose Rizal believed in the power of peace and non-violence. The avenue in New Delhi named after your national hero continues to inspire and motivate us.   

3.      I deeply appreciate this opportunity to celebrate the legacy of the Mahatma at the Centre for Peace Education – a Centre that promotes a culture of peace through education and advocacy.  The venue could not have been more appropriate. No doubt, generations of students who pass through your gates will continue to be inspired by his legacy, of being just and ethical in conduct; compassionate and humble in treating fellow human beings; and standing up and championing truth and truth alone, even in most trying times.    

4.      I was also touched to hear the rendition of Mahatma Gandhi’s favourite hymn – Vaishnava Jana To Tene Kahiye – by the famous     Filipino singer, Grace NoNo. This year, the hymn was sung in over 150 countries, as a fitting tribute to a man who embraced entire humanity as one indivisible family. The hymn describes a good human-being as one who reaches out to those in pain and suffering. Indeed, the world would be a much better place if only we had such empathy for each other. 

5.      This bust of Mahatma Gandhi is a gift from the people of India to you. But the Mahatma belongs to all peoples, all cultures and all societies. May he continue to guide us in our shared journey of peace, harmony and sustainable development for all. 

6.      I would once again like to thank Miriam College and all those who have contributed to organizing this special event. I depart from the Philippines tomorrow, but will always treasure your warmth and friendship. 

 

Thank you!

	I am happy to be with you today. I thank you for your warm and special welcome. We celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October the world over. You also remembered him fondly in Manila. We just saw a cultural programme on Mahatma Gandhi and our Freedom Struggle. I hope Bapu’s ideals and his sacrifice shall continue to inspire us in our daily lives. 



	It is always a pleasure for me to meet our brothers and sisters abroad. In each of the 26 countries that I have visited as President of India so far, I have met with the Indian community and shared my thoughts with them.  To meet our people in faraway lands is an emotional and special experience for me, one that you have when you meet your near and dear ones.
	My State Visit to the Philippines marks an important occasion. We are celebrating the 70th anniversary of our diplomatic relations with the Philippines this year. I met with President Duterte day before yesterday and held talks on the way forward for our bilateral ties. President Duterte was highly appreciative of the role of the Indian community in the Philippines. He had kind words to say about you and his decades-old relationship with friends of Indian origin. 



	I also addressed a business event.  Just before coming here, I had the honour to unveil a bust of Mahatma Gandhi at Miriam College in Quezon City. On my visit, I also had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of the Jaipur prosthetic foot and with parents of babies who have successfully undergone liver transplant in India. I am delighted that India’s outreach and external engagement today touches the lives of ordinary people as never before. 


Ladies and gentlemen,


	Our community in the Philippines has been a strong bond of friendship between our two countries for decades.  The size of the diaspora has grown remarkably over the last few years.  All of you are contributing to the economy and society of the Philippines and to the image of India and Indians in the Philippines.  We deeply value your contribution. 



	I am happy that you have maintained your culture and traditions in this country.  You have also done well to keep our languages alive in your daily lives, be it Punjabi, Sindhi, Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi or Gujarati.  I understand that yoga is very popular in the Philippines and ayurveda is also gaining ground. You must do your best to promote our heritage and knowledge for the well-being and happiness of all.  It is matter of immense pride for us that wherever our community goes, it takes with it the values of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”, that is - the whole world is one family.  In these times of strife and violence, it is these values of our civilization that can ensure peace and friendship among peoples and countries.  
	It is not surprising that such a large community has also created places of worship in the Philippines which helps in meeting the spiritual needs of the community. I understand that apart from Hindu temples, as many as 26 Gurudwaras exist throughout the length and breadth of this beautiful country. This year, we are celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji and I convey my good wishes to all of you on the occasion. 



	I have heard many stories of the Philippines being a hospitable and friendly country for Indians. As professionals, as entrepreneurs and as technocrats you have freely pursued your vocation and contributed to the progress and prosperity of this country. The people here have been warm and welcoming to you. And so have they been to the thousands of students from India studying medicine here. The signing of a Tourism Promotion Agreement during my visit promises to bring the people of the two countries further close.  


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	India-Philippines relations are driven by our shared values such as commitment to democracy, secularism and pluralism.  Our ties are both old and new. We cannot but be proud of our seafaring forefathers who more than a millennium back established cultural and commercial ties between India and the South East Asia.  



	With regard to the Philippines, these ties are yet to be fully explored and documented. But we do know that old artifacts have been unearthed in the Philippines that are distinctly of Indian influence. The Laguna Copper Plate inscription, the oldest artifact discovered in the Philippines, is written in Kavi which possibly derived from the Pallava script. A golden statue of Goddess Tara has also been found in Agusan.  Clearly, these finds testify that our relations with the Philippines are not new. In my discussions with President Duterte, we have decided to undertake a systematic study of these ancient relations and civilizational connections.  


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	India today is the land of many opportunities and many possibilities. We are committed to transform India, to unleash the energy of our youth, to build next-generation infrastructure and to eradicate extreme poverty in not so distant future. India is today one of the fastest growing major economies. Our target is to become a 5 trillion economy by 2025. We are committed to inclusive growth, where each and every section of the society is cared for. Our socio-economic programmes have brought immense benefits to the poor. Our Ayushman Bharat programme, the world’s largest health insurance scheme, covers 500 million people, and our Jan Dhan Yojana has facilitated over 370 million people to open bank accounts and reap the benefits of formal banking economy. 



	In our efforts to build a new India, we need your support and helping hand. I call upon you to avail of the opportunities that India today offers- for innovation, investment, research and education.  Our flagship initiatives such as Make in India, Digital India, Skill India, Ganga Rejuvenation Project, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart Cities and Jal Jeevan Mission seek your partnership. 



	We are making rapid progress in India and as much in our external engagement. Our bilateral economic engagement in terms of investment and presence of Indian companies in the Philippines is on the upswing. India-Philippines trade has risen to nearly 2.5 billion US dollars. However, for our two fast-growing economies, the quantum of our bilateral trade is still modest. There is much potential which needs to be tapped.  I am sure with your initiatives and enterprise; we can do much more to bring prosperity to the two countries. 


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	India is deeply committed to strengthen its bond with the diaspora and to attend to your needs. We have already relaxed rules and regulations for you to obtain OCI cards.  We have made our consular service delivery people-sensitive and people-friendly. We are dutifully reaching out to those in need, through social media platforms and through community networks. We are also offering seats in educational institutions for your children to study in India. And we are running “Know India Program” for the youth and for the elderly, to connect you deeper to your roots and to your culture. Here in the Philippines, the Embassy will soon begin printing of passports in Manila and this will drastically reduce the time taken for issuance of new passports.  We hope to serve you better and better. 


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	I treasure this opportunity to address all of you. I wish you success in all your endeavours and wish you Diwali greetings in advance.  And before I say good bye, I warmly invite you to visit Rashtrapati Bhavan when you are in Delhi next. Yes, it is my official residence, but it belongs to all Indians. We look forward to welcome you. 


Thank you!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, attended the Indian Community Reception hosted by Shri Jaideep Mazumdar, Ambassador of India to the Philippines in Manila today (October 20, 2019).  

Addressing the gathering, the President said that Indian community in the Philippines has been a strong bond of friendship between our two countries for decades.  The size of the diaspora has grown remarkably over the last few years.  All of them are contributing to the economy and society of the Philippines and to the image of India and Indians in the Philippines.  

The President said that in our efforts to build a new India, we need Indian Diaspora’s support and helping hand. He called upon them to avail of the opportunities that India today offers - for innovation, investment, research and education. He said that India’s flagship initiatives such as Make in India, Digital India, Skill India, Ganga Rejuvenation Project, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart Cities and Jal Jeevan Mission seek their partnership. 

The President said that India’s bilateral economic engagement in terms of investment and presence of Indian companies in the Philippines is on the upswing. India-Philippines trade has risen to nearly US$ 2.5 billion. However, for our two fast-growing economies, the quantum of our bilateral trade is still modest. There is much potential which needs to be tapped. He expressed confidence that with Indian community’s initiatives and enterprise; we can do much more to bring prosperity to the two countries. 

Earlier in the day, the President unveiled a bust of Mahatma Gandhi at Miriam College, Quezon City in the presence of the Mayor of the City and other dignitaries.  Speaking on the occasion, the President said that this bust of Mahatma Gandhi is a gift from the people of India to people of Philippines. But the Mahatma belongs to all peoples, all cultures and all societies. May he continue to guide us in our shared journey of peace, harmony and sustainable development for all. 

Tomorrow morning (October 21, 2019), the President will leave for Japan – the final leg of his state visit to two nations.

	 I am pleased to address the India-Philippines Business Conclave and the 4th ASEAN-India Business Summit. I thank the business organisations and government bodies from the Philippines and India for organising today’s event. 


 


	This is my first State Visit to the Philippines. I am here to mark and celebrate 70 years of the Philippines-India diplomatic relations. Yesterday, I had wide-ranging discussions with President Duterte. We agreed to take forward and broaden our bilateral ties, in particular trade and economic relations. The Philippines is our natural partner in the ASEAN region. In recent years, we have seen an up-swing in bilateral trade and investment. We need to not just maintain the present momentum but to accelerate it further.


 


	 The potential for the Philippines-India economic collaboration is significant. Both countries share mutual complementarities which can be utilised to deepen trade and investment ties. Both India and the Philippines are among the fastest growing economies; both possess large, young and aspirational population; both are invested in new technologies, innovation and start-ups; both are services powerhouse; and both are committed to inclusive growth, fighting corruption and bringing about transformative changes in people’s life.


 


	India’s “Make in India” and next-generation infrastructure programmes and the Philippines’ “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure initiative present immense opportunities for companies and investors on both sides. In the coming years, India will be spending about 1.3 trillion US dollars to develop next-generation infrastructure, from Smart cities, ports, airports, expressways to digital i-ways. A focussed business approach which combines investors with opportunities, and partnerships with projects, is the way forward. I am happy that your deliberations earlier today have been most helpful on this score.


 

Ladies and gentlemen, 


	The Philippines-India business story is an encouraging one.  While bilateral trade has shown continuous progress, the real gain has been our collaboration in the IT-BPO segment. Leading Indian IT majors have set up enterprises in Manila creating job opportunities for the youth and value addition for the global economy.  As we race into the digital age, we have immense opportunities before us to fill e-commerce shelves, create fin-tech services, develop imaginative entertainment platforms, and power green and clean solutions. 


 


	In recent years, we have seen two-way investment grow in infrastructure and energy sectors. More prospects wait to be converted into concrete projects, from airport terminals, LNG pipelines to waste management solutions. The Indian pharma and healthcare sectors offer immense value to the Philippines. And while Indian tourists to the Philippines continue to grow, medical tourist numbers from here to India are also on the rise. Our world class healthcare services at affordable cost are bringing joy to people’s lives in this country. There is scope to enhance partnership in several other areas - from trade, investment, services, agriculture, engineering to new technologies.  


 

Ladies and gentlemen,


	I just gave you a snapshot of the Philippines-India business collaboration. Philippines’ economic dynamism and India’s growth call for greater and deeper engagement. India is the sixth largest economy in the world today. We have set a target to become a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2025. India’s economic and business environment is undergoing a transformation like never before. We have undertaken path-breaking taxation and banking reforms. Our sustained reform efforts have led to a spectacular jump of 65 places for India on the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index. We have also moved 44 ranks on the Logistics Performance Index. We have worked hard to strengthen the IPR regime. Most recently, we have slashed corporate tax rate to boost growth and investment. As a result of our efforts, in the last 5 years, we have received FDI worth 286 billion US dollars. This is half of India's total FDI inflow in the last 20 years.  


 


	 India is following a strong growth path. But we are equally conscious of equity. To distribute the fruits of development, we have undertaken the world's largest financial inclusion initiative under which over 370 million people, at the bottom of the pyramid, have been made bankable. Small and medium enterprises have a major role to play in the Philippines and Indian economies. A major constraint for small entrepreneurs is the lack of collateral for finance. Last year alone, under our MUDRA scheme we disbursed collateral free loans worth 44 billion US dollars. Our two countries have much to share and learn from each other, even as we do our best to promote the Small and Medium Enterprises segment. 


 


	India is home to the third largest Start-up network in the world with over 21,000 enterprises. The Philippines is also making significant progress in innovation and entrepreneurship sectors. I am told that the GO NEGOSYO movement in the Philippines has made significant contribution to fostering new enterprises. I had the pleasure of presenting India’s Padma Shri award to Presidential Advisor for Entrepreneurship, Mr. Jose Conception present here, in New Delhi last year for his work in this field. Secretary Lopez has also provided valuable support to the initiative. I am happy that the 2nd ASEAN-India Innovation and Technology Summit is taking place in Davao in November 2019.  I wish the Summit all success.  


 

Ladies and gentlemen, 


	  ASEAN-India relations are special. Our “Act East” policy puts this region at the centre of our engagement with the Indo-Pacific.  Last year, I had the honour to host Heads of State and Government from all the ASEAN countries as Guest of Honour at our Republic Day celebrations. The ASEAN is one of the most economically dynamic regions of the world today.  We have deep political and people-to-people relations with each and every country in the ASEAN.  We wish to bring our economic and business relations up to the same level.   


 


	ASEAN-India trade has jumped significantly in the past few years. Last year alone, the trade increased by 19 per cent to reach 96.79 billion US dollars. However, we still have a long distance to cover to reach the target of 200 billion US dollars by 2022. Effective use of existing mechanisms, particularly the ASEAN-India Business Council can go a long way in realizing this goal. Just as Indian companies see significant opportunities in the region, I am sure the ASEAN business community also recognises the tremendous business potential in India. India wishes to participate in your growth story and we invite all of the ASEAN to participate in ours.


 

Ladies and gentlemen, 


	 Today’s event embodies the spirit of both bilateral partnership and regional cooperation. I am confident that your discussions today will contribute to further strengthening of not just the Philippines-India business ties, but ASEAN-India trade and investment relations as well. I wish you success in your future endeavours.


 

Maraming Salamat! Thank you!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the India-Philippines Business Conclave and the 4th ASEAN-India Business Summit  in Manila, Philippines today (October 19, 2019).

Earlier in this morning, the President met and interacted with the parents of babies who underwent liver transplant in India under the Philippine – India Pediatric Liver Transplant Program. On the occasion, the President was happy to note that India’s engagement in the Philippines has brought people’s causes and life-giving projects within its expanding ambit. He said that there is nothing more valuable than human life. And for parents there can be nothing more important than the health and well-being of their children. So to see the healthy, happy babies today and the smiles on the faces of their parents is truly heart-warming for him. He congratulated all stakeholders for facilitating this human connection between the Philippines and India. 

The President also visited the University of the Philippines Manila Museum to attend an event organised by Mahaveer Philippines Foundation.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind reached Manila, Philippines, yesterday (October 17, 2019) in the first leg of his visit to two nations - Philippines and Japan.

 

Today (October 18, 2019), the President commenced his engagements with visit to the Rizal Park where he paid tributes to Dr Jose Rizal, the national hero of Philippines. He was also presented the ‘Key to the City’ by the Mayor of Manila City, Mr Domagoso at the Rizal Park.

 

Subsequently, the President visited the Malacanan Palace where he was received by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte of Philippines and accorded a ceremonial welcome. During the one-to-one discussions, the two leaders discussed bilateral cooperation as well as regional and global issues of the day.

 

Subsequently, the President led delegation-level talks between the two sides. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that as two vibrant democracies that believe in a rules-based international order, respect for international law and sovereign equality of nations, the Philippines and India are natural partners in the pursuit of their respective national development and security objectives.

 

The President said that there is immense potential to further deepen the Philippines - India economic ties. The Philippines is emerging as an important focus country for India’s corporate sector. Indian companies are interested in partner Filipino companies in digital industries, innovation and start-ups, health and pharma and in the crucial area of agricultural development. India is also keen to participate in infrastructure development as well as in defence modernization of the Philippines. In both these areas, he said, Indian companies have made their mark and attained global reputation. He invited companies from the Philippines to invest in India’s transformative growth and development.

 

The President said that for India, ASEAN is a region of great importance. India wants to see a strong, unified and prosperous ASEAN playing a central role in the emerging dynamic of the Indo-Pacific. Engagement with ASEAN has been, and will remain, a critical element of India’s ‘Act East’ policy and strategy.

 

India and Philippines signed and exchanged four agreements in the fields of maritime domain, security, tourism, science and technology and culture in the presence of the two Presidents.

 

Later in the evening, the President attended a banquet hosted in his honour by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte of Philippines. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that this year is a landmark in our bilateral journey. The President said that this visit is undertaken to celebrate the 70th anniversary of our diplomatic relations and to yet again commit ourselves to the Philippines-India bilateral partnership.

                1. I extend a very warm and special welcome to Your Majesties and the distinguished members of your delegation to India. Your Majesties, India is not new to you. We have had the honour to host you in Rashtrapati Bhavan in the past.  But today is a very special day. You are on your first State Visit to India. We are truly delighted to have you with us. 

2. India-Netherlands relations are warm and enduring. Our shared democratic values and respect for diversity continue to embellish our conversation and our collaboration. In our endeavours, we connect with each other in one and several ways at the same time. That is the beauty and the depth of our ties.  In a few weeks from now, we will be celebrating Diwali, the festival of light, in India and with equal joy in the Netherlands. And just few days ago, we together celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. I thank you and your people for nurturing his legacy and his universal values.  

3. Our cultural understanding and centuries-old interaction make our partnership that much more meaningful. From the Malabar Coast to the Coromandal and beyond, we have deep imprint of Dutch heritage and history among us. The splendid murals in Kochi and the authoritative Dutch memoirs of the Malabar speak of our deep intellectual engagement. Swami Vivekananda, the great Indian philosopher visited Amsterdam in 1896. Some of his earliest disciples were Dutchmen and the emblem of the Ramakrishna Mission founded by him was developed on his guidance by the illustrious Dutch-American personality Henry Van Haagen. We take pride that Rembrandt, the greatest of all Dutch artists, was influenced in his work by many things Indian. The exhibition during your visit on this global icon would testify how deeply we appreciate him and his works. 

4. Your Majesty, on the strong foundation of our historic ties, we have created a contemporary partnership driven by innovation, investment and technology. Smart Solutions, Smart Cities, green energy, start-ups and new-age products are bringing us together. We are excited to share and learn from you on river rejuvenation, from the Barapullah to the Yamuna, from Jal Jeevan Mission to Namami Gange, and further downstream. 

5. Your Majesty, our economic partnership has created new opportunities for our peoples, from jobs, lifestyle choices to food. The vegetables that you savour today has been grown with green Indian fingers trained at the Indo-Dutch Centre of Excellence in Baramati. We are truly privileged that our journey together, has, indeed, been a journey of our people together. The Netherlands today is home to the largest Indian community on mainland Europe. The Surinami-Hindustani community in the Netherlands shares a strong cultural bond with India. The growing Indian student and professional community in your country is making our cultural knot stronger and our technology partnership deeper. We eagerly look forward to the inauguration of the Technology Summit tomorrow, and to drawing upon its success subsequently. 

6. Your Majesties, each year, we have tulips bloom in Rashtrapati Bhavan. But this year, they will be very special, for they will carry the memories of your visit and the warmth of our friendship. May our ties blossom forever. 

7. With these words, I once again welcome Your Majesties to India and wish you a memorable stay.

Dank u wel!  Thank You.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received His Majesty King Willem-Alexander and Her Majesty Queen Maxima of the Kingdom of Netherlands at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (October 14, 2019). He also hosted a banquet in their honour.

Welcoming them to India, the President said that bilateral ties between India and Netherlands are strong and growing. We have exchanged three visits at the level of Prime Minister in the last four years. These have provided significant momentum to our bilateral cooperation. He expressed confidence that this State Visit will impart further boost to our engagement and deepen our relations.

The President said that economic partnership is a key pillar of India-Netherlands bilateral ties. The Netherlands is India’s 4th largest trading partner in the European Union. Netherlands is also among the leading investors in India.  Indian companies have made significant investment in Netherlands as well.  He said that Dutch companies have a global name in the fields of agriculture, water management, port development, waste management and urban planning. He invited them to partner India in its growth story.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, laid the foundation stone for the campus of JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research at Varuna Village, Mysuru today (October 11, 2019).

Speaking on the occasion, the President was happy to note that Global Campus of JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research at Varuna Village is a tribute to Sri Shivarathri Rajendra Mahaswamiji whose 104th Jayanti is being celebrated this year. He said that Sri Suttur Math’s focus on education was strongly encouraged by Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamiji. JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research was established in 2008 and is today regarded as a reputed institute of health sciences. He expressed confidence that this new ‘Global Campus’ of JSS Academy will help the institution to further contribute in the field of education.

Pointing out the healthcare challenges in our country, the President said that we have achieved a lot over the years. Yet, health remains a key development challenge for us. As a country we are challenged by the triple burden of communicable, noncommunicable and new and emerging diseases. Malnutrition and neglected tropical diseases place severe constraints on us. We need to improve access to health services.

The President said that cleanliness and sanitation is the base requirement for tackling many of our health-related issues and diseases. A nationwide revolution for cleanliness and health is already underway. It must continue and become stronger with each passing day. This would be our tribute to Mahatma Gandhi whose 150th birth anniversary we just celebrated.

The President said that our health challenges are linked to our larger socio-economic challenges. Our solutions to meet our health challenges need to be broad-based and multi-pronged. They must use the power of both modern medicine and traditional knowledge. They must focus on both the mind and the body. They must involve both prevention and cure.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the birth centenary celebrations of Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar of Mysore today (October 10, 2019) in Mysuru. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Maharaja Wadiyar, the 25th Maharaja of the Kingdom of Mysore, was an exceptional ruler and able administrator. He was also a noted philosopher, music exponent, political thinker and philanthropist. When India won independence, he was the first among the rulers of India’s princely states to accept the Instrument of Accession. The Maharaja signed it on 9th August, 1947 and the Union Government accepted it on 16th August. He should be thus regarded as the icon of India’s transition to democracy. His pioneering contribution to the unity and integrity of the newly independent nation will never be forgotten.

 

The President said that Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar was not only an exceptional scholar of Indian philosophy himself but also promoted scholarship through the ‘Jayachamaraja Grantha Ratna Mala’. His support for entrepreneurship is also an inspiring story. As the ruler of the Mysore state, he actively encouraged the establishment of an industrial facility in Bengaluru by a company called Hindustan Aircraft in 1940 which become Hindustan Aeronautics.

 

The President was happy to note that the Maharaja gifted the magnificent Cheluvamba Mansion in Mysore to the Government to start the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI). He said that Maharaja’s similar donations helped the government set up the National Tuberculosis Institute in Bangalore and the All India Institute of Speech and Hearing at Mysore.

 

The President said that legendary leaders like Maharaja Wadiyar have shaped the life we lead today. The best tribute we can pay him on the occasion of his birth centenary is to emulate his values and his vision in our daily lives.

	It gives me immense pleasure to be present amid my sky soldiers. In my capacity as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, I dedicate this event to the armed forces of our country.



	It has been 32 years since the Army Aviation Corps came into existence. This period has been replete with tales of heroism, honour and glory in various operations. Immediately after its raising in 1986, the Army Aviation Corps proved its impeccable combat credentials during ‘Operation Pawan’ in Sri Lanka.



	The Siachen Glacier has been the ultimate operational frontier for the Corps since 1984. Routinely operating at 20000 feet and above in extremely challenging conditions, the highly skilled and motivated pilots of the Corps have been carrying out yeoman service in ‘Operation Meghdoot’.



	In this context, I would particularly refer to my Siachen visit on May 10 last year at Kumar Post.  It was a unique experience.  Our Jawans living there in most adverse circumstances in the glacier is a testimony to their unparalleled valour and determination. I realized on my visit that we live in peace because of vigilance and sacrifices of these brave soldiers. 



	The Army Aviation Corps has earned 273 Honours and Awards for conspicuous gallantry and distinguished service. This speaks volumes of the exceptional valour and spirit of the Corps personnel and is a model for all soldiers and officers of our armed forces. You have earned distinction in various wars and operations and have excelled in sports, adventure and overcome numerous professional challenges.



	Your courage and steadfastness have won you the Battle title ‘Kargil’ in ‘Operation Vijay’ in 1999. Many of your squadrons have been awarded the prestigious ‘Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation’ for their exceptional performance. You have been excellent ambassadors of our country while operating overseas in countries like Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while on United Nations Peace Keeping Missions. You have performed much beyond the call of duty during natural calamities.



	At this Colour Presentation Ceremony, I would like to pay homage to the martyrs of the Army Aviation Corps. Their blood and sacrifice has secured our sovereignty and brought glory to our nation. I also congratulate all veterans and serving soldiers of the Corps for their devotion to duty and professional conduct. You have been true force multipliers in some of the most inhospitable terrain and adverse climatic conditions in the world. I take this opportunity to convey my best wishes to all ranks and families of the entire Army Aviation Corps fraternity. The Indian Army and the nation are proud of you.



	We take the solemn vow to defend the borders as well as sovereignty of our country against all odds. I am confident that we will fulfill this vow and uphold the dignity of our nation and our people, whatever be the cost, and strive for excellence in all our endeavours.



	May you fly high and bring glory to the nation. I wish you “Happy Landings” and “God Speed”.


Thank you, Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Durga Puja has said:-

""On the auspicious occasion of Durga Puja, I convey greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens in India and abroad.

Durga Puja symbolises the victory of good over evil. The Puja also strengthens the belief that ultimately truth and justice prevail. This belief inspires us to follow the path of honesty, truth and justice. By doing so, we will succeed in taking the benefits of development to even the most deprived sections of society.

This festival, celebrated at the onset of winter, is also an expression of our culture and social amity. Let us celebrate this festival with full fervour, enthusiasm and harmony”.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 51st Foundation Day of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India in New Delhi today (October 5, 2019).

Speaking on the occasion, the president said that in recent times, we have seen how some business enterprises have broken the trust of the people. Companies have either faltered or have come to a standstill. In the process, common people have had to suffer. He said that company secretaries play the role of a governance professional and an internal business partner. They must foster responsible business and balance economic objectives with larger socio-economic goals. They must ensure that the stakeholders understand the difference between profit and profiteering, and comply by laws. And they must deliberate on issues where we need to improve, so that mistakes or limitations of the past are adequately addressed. 

The President said that the concept of corporate governance is complex but the principles on which it is based are clear and well marked. Transparency, accountability, integrity and fairness are its four pillars. Company secretaries should responsibly determine how these principles are put into practice. India has drawn a blueprint to enhance its brand value as a destination for international business and investment. In this effort, how they implement company laws in a transparent manner has a critical bearing.

The President said that an efficient, fair and just corporate governance system forms a key component of our nation-building matrix. And company secretaries have a seminal responsibility to fulfil on this account. Their integrity and honesty determines our commitment to a just society.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the Vayoshreshtha Sammans – a scheme of National Awards for senior citizens of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment - today (October 3, 2019) in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that senior citizens are important parts of our social and national life. He noted that Central and State Governments are taking various steps - such as Ayushman Bharat, concessional rail fair, savings schemes for senior citizens, old age pensions – to make their lives easy. 

The President said that while appreciating the efforts made by governments and NGOs, we should also take some responsibilities at own level for our senior citizens.  Together we must maintain an environment in which they have freedom of thoughts and expressions. We have to make them feel that their contributions are useful for family and society.  This will give them a sense of self-satisfaction and their body and mind will remain healthy. 

The President said that young generation should always remember that elder people symbolize our legacy and heritage. By giving them due respect and help, youth can progress in their lives.  He said that all generations should live in harmonious coexistence and keep our culture of joint family intact. Nature has built an unbreakable relationship between each generation so that our experience, knowledge and skills can be transferred seamlessly to the next generations. 

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment and Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the India Today Safaigiri Summit and presented the most effective Swachchta Ambassador award to Shri Sachin Tendulkar in New Delhi today (October 2,2019) on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the president said that in the past five years, the sanitation drive launched in the country had truly become a mass movement. Everyone from Prime Minister to Gram Pradhan has participated directly or indirectly in the cleanliness campaign to make it a success. He said that this historic success could not have been achieved without participation of every citizen.

Referring to India being declared as open defecation free (ODF) this evening by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said that it would be a real tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on the occasion of his birth anniversary. He pointed out that though the United Nation had set sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030, India would be completing it 11 years ahead of the schedule. For this feat, every citizen of the country deserved appreciation, he said.

The president particularly referred to cleanliness as a continuous process that needs to be sustained all the time. We should not be lax in our efforts by being satisfied with our achievements, he said. He also urged to develop a competitive model of cleanliness at village, block and district levels across the country to make further improvement in cleanliness drive. He said that on the basis of five years achievement, we must strive to achieve the goal of ODF plus by introducing technology in cleanliness campaign.

The President said that let us make the cleanliness integral to our collective social life to build a prosperous nation. We have to develop a thinking in which everyone will strive to make his house, street, village, town or city as the most clean and beautiful.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Gandhi Jayanti has said:- 

“150th Gandhi Jayanti is a special occasion for all of us to rededicate ourselves to the values of truth, non-violence, harmony, morality and simplicity. Satya, Ahimsa and Sarvodaya formed the bedrock of Mahatama Gandhi’s numerous messages to humanity. 

Gandhiji is a global icon revered across continents. United Nations has marked Gandhi Jayanti as ‘The International Day of Non-Violence’. Gandhian values and many of his methods remain relevant not only for India but for the entire world. 

Gandhiji’s vision and action encompassed almost every facet of individual and collective life. He showed us the path to communal unity, removal of untouchability, upliftment of women, education, sanitation, preserving the environment and water. 

By taking up the ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ as a movement, the people of India have paid homage to the Father of the Nation. Our nation’s emphasis on inclusive growth, transparency and honesty in public life, health-care support to the poor, support to the farmers and effective utilization of water resources is in keeping with the thoughts of Gandhi Ji.

 Let us resolve to strengthen the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi”.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today urged political parties not to make statements on Jammu and Kashmir that would affect the unity of the country and give advantage to India’s neighbor, which is aiding and abetting cross-border terrorism.

Speaking at a function organized by Pragna Bharati on the occasion of Rashtriya Ekta Diwas to commemorate Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary at MCR HRD institute in Hyderabad today, the Vice President asserted that dilution of Article 370 was meant to empower the people of Jammu and Kashmir and extend all the laws.

Observing that the dilution of Article 370 was a simple administrative arrangement, he said the people across the country rejoiced as they felt that real unity was achieved.

Describing Sardar as Unifier of India, he quoted Sardar Patel as saying that ‘unity and more unity’ was his watchword. He observed that there was a need for unity and more unity in the country now.

Shri Naidu said that every Indian must strive to protect the unity, integrity, safety, security, and sovereignty of India. He said that it was the best and only way to honour legendary leader and visionary statesman, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who left an indelible mark on the historical canvas of our country.

The Vice President stressed the need to make youngsters aware of the humongous efforts and sacrifices made by leaders like Sardar Patel to unify India.

He suggested incorporating a detailed chapter in school textbooks on the stupendous contribution of Sardar Patel for the creation of a united India.

Observing that Sardar Patel not only brought about geographical unity but also cared deeply about social, religious and cultural unity of the Country, the Vice President said “Shri Patel took upon himself the mission of uniting India and succeeded through his tact, patience, calm and dignified persuasion”.

Describing Sardar Patel as the chief architect of India’s steel frame—the civil services, the Vice President said that he envisaged the all India services as an important cementing force in promoting the unity and integrity of the nation.

Referring to former Deputy Prime Minister’s qualities of leadership and steely determination, the Vice President said that Shri Patel’s contribution to unify India would forever remain as one of the greatest accomplishments in the annals of world history.

Talking about Sardar Patel’s deft handling of complex situations including in the erstwhile Hyderabad State ruled by the then Nizam, the Vice President said that Shri Patel achieved the mission impossible through his extraordinary firmness and statesmanship.   

He pointed out that various princely States had accepted his appeal to join the Indian Union because he emphasized the fundamental homogeneity of culture and sentiment among the people and requested them to join India “inspired by a common allegiance to our motherland for the common good of us all”.

Talking about the clarion call given by Sardar Patel many years ago to collectively build a new India, the Vice President called upon people to make a strong resolve to build a stronger, united, forward-looking India in which each citizen feels secure and confident to lead a fulfilling and happy life.

Stating that inclusion and welfare of all must be at the heart of the concept of unity, the Vice President said that Shri Patel wanted Indian states to cooperate and work towards taking India to new greatness.

“Incidentally, this echoes the current government’s overarching idea of “Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwas,” he said.

Following is the full text of the speech –

“The first President of India Shri Rajendra Prasad ji wrote in his dairy in 1959 – “That there is today an India to think and talk about is very largely due to Sardar Patel’s statesmanship and firm administration. Yet we are apt to ignore him.”

It is this colossus of Independence movement we are remembering today.  It is a day when we are paying homage to the most astute political administrator and in many ways, one of the chief architects of our nation.

Quite appropriately, we are marking this day as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas because Sardar Patel had once said that his watchword was “unity and more unity”. He took upon himself the mission of uniting India and succeeded through his tact, patience and calm, dignified persuasion.

Popularly known as the ‘Iron Man of India’, Shri Patel was the architect of integrating more than 560 princely States into the Union of India at the time of Independence. Displaying the highest qualities of statesmanship and steely determination Shri Patel went about the task of unifying India, which will remain as one of the greatest accomplishments in the annals of world history.

Mountbatten had paid rich tributes to Sardar Patel when he said, “There is no doubt that by far the most important achievement of the present Government is the unification of the State into the Domain of India. Had you failed in this, the results would have been disastrous. But since you have succeeded, no one can see the disastrous results that have been avoided.” Thanks to Sardar Patel, we are reunited as one nation.

Thanks to his deft handling of a complex situation, the people in this very place in the erstwhile Hyderabad State ruled by the then Nizam were liberated from his despotic reign and joined the rest of India on September 17, 1948.

He achieved the mission impossible through his extraordinary firmness and statesmanship.  The Princes accepted his appeal to join the Indian Union because he emphasized the fundamental homogeneity of culture and sentiment among the people and requested them to join India “inspired by common allegiance to our motherland for the common good of us all”.

His persona was aptly summed up by his biographer Narhari Parikh, who had said: “Harder than steel in national matters, but softer than a flower in personal and private relations”.            

Lavishing praise on Shri Patel, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru described him as the architect of Indian unity. “Sardar hammered out a nation with iron and foil. History will record it in many pages and call him the builder and consolidator of the new India and say many other things about him”.

One of his great qualities was that he never allowed the bitterness of the past to affect his relations or cloud his emotions. His courteous treatment of the Nizam after ‘Operation Polo’ made the latter to say:  “Your great personality is a valuable asset for India at this critical period when the whole world is in turmoil”.

Patel was a multifaceted personality. He was a dynamic political leader, an organizer par excellence, a competent administrator and a skillful negotiator. Apart from his earthy disposition, he also had saintly qualities in the sense that he never hankered after power.

Patel’s graciousness and magnanimity came to the fore when he had readily abided by Mahatma Gandhi’s advice to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Congress President in favour of Pandit Nehru in 1946, although a majority of State Congress committees supported his candidature.

Sardar Patel was the chief architect of India’s steel frame—the civil services. He envisaged the all India services as an important cementing force in promoting the unity and integrity of the nation. 

In his famous address to the civil service probationers in 1947, Patel had told them to be guided by a real spirit of service in their day-to-day administration. He asked them to treat the common man as their own.

Lauding the selfless devotion of Sardar Patel to the cause of the motherland, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad had observed: “He made his choice out of the two courses that come before a man, namely, would he live for his country or for himself. Sardar chose his country”.

After coming under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel abandoned his European attire, plunged into freedom struggle, organized peasants against the highhandedness of the British rulers at Kheda and in the landmark Bardoli satyagraha.

It is important for today’s youngsters to be aware and understand the humongous efforts and sacrifices made by leaders like Sardar Patel to unify India. I feel that there should be a detailed chapter in school textbooks on the stupendous contribution of Sardar Patel to the creation of a united India.

Dear sisters and brothers,

As we observe Rashtriya Ekta  Diwas today to commemorate Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary, every Indian must strive to protect the unity, integrity, safety, security and sovereignty of India. This is the best and only way to honour this great leader, an iconic figure, a legendary leader, a visionary statesman who has left an indelible mark on the historical canvas of our country. He is among the tallest of our leaders who not only brought about geographical unity but also cared deeply about social, religious and cultural unity.

He knew that India was under foreign rule because of lack of unity.  As he said, “It is the lesson of history that it was owing to the country’s politically fragmented condition and our inability to take a united stand that India succumbed to successive waves of invaders. Our mutual conflicts and internecine quarrels and jealousies have in the past been the cause of our downfall and our falling victims to foreign domination a number of times. We cannot afford to fall into those errors or traps again.”

He wanted post-independence India to be united and stay united without any narrow considerations and divisions on the basis of caste, creed, religion or language.  For him, “What we have is not swaraj but only freedom from foreign rule.  The people have still to win internal swaraj, abolish distinctions of caste and creed, banish untouchability, improve the lot of hungry masses, and live as one joint family – in short to create a new way of life and bring about a change of heart and a change of outlook.”

As the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities etc., he succeeded in allaying the apprehensions of the minorities, “We have tried to overcome our weaknesses honestly and in a definite manner. The proof, if any proof is needed, is Hindu- Muslim unity…  I can proudly claim that our relationship is not merely of friendship but of fruitful cooperation so that we can take the nation forward. Similarly, we have established cordial relations with Parsis, Christians and other citizens of the country.”

Sardar Patel was a great visionary who left his distinct impact on our Constitution whether it is regarding fundamental rights or Directive Principles or Union-State relations or All India Services. As the noted Constitutional expert Shri Subhash C. Kashyap points out, his farsighted vision is evident from the reference to “governance” in Article 37 of the Constitution  much before the country started discussing “governance” or “good governance”.

Sardar Patel put forth his views with great clarity borne out of strong conviction.  He seems at times to be a social reformer as well. He wanted the social evils like untouchability to go.  He urged that, “We have to speedily forget all these things. Such boundaries hamper our growth.” His focus was on ‘living’ the ‘values of Indian tradition’. As he reminded us once, “We always speak of India’s culture, of India’s civilization, but do we ever pause to think that the relief of the poor, mutual aid amongst neighbours, charity to the helpless and kindness to the downtrodden have been the shining virtues of that culture and civilization? Let us ask ourselves if we are living in the spirit of those ancient virtues!”

This extraordinary icon of unity, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was also an ardent champion of probity in public services and integrity in public life.

Talking of cleanliness to which he, like Mahatma Gandhi, was passionately attached, he reflected on his experience as Chairman of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and with a great sense of profound humour said, “To cleanse the dirt of the city is quite different from cleansing the dirt of politics.  From the former you get a good night’s rest while the latter keeps you worried and lose your sleep.”

He was quite a stickler for perfection and demanded dedication to the nation as an essential pre-requisite for public service. He suggested that, “Those who lack the spirit of sacrifice and those who do not prefer the collective interest of the people of India to their own personal interest have no right to adorn the assemblies either.  If we cannot show a high order of sense of sacrifice we cannot do justice either to India or to its people who vote for us.”

For the iron man with a golden heart, India’s unity, integrity, sovereignty and security were paramount.  Everything else was secondary. 

It is good to recall his speech at Nagpur on November 4th 1948, in which he called upon people to realize their true duty to nation amidst dangers to her security, in these words: “We are India’s guardians and as long as we live, we are not going to tolerate all these dangers to our national existence.”

सरदार वल्लभभाई पटेल के जीवन और कृतित्व का मात्र एक ही सार है - एकता। उनका जीवनदर्शन इस देश के नागरिकों के कल्याण के प्रति अगाध निष्ठा से प्रेरित था, तुच्छ भेदभाव को समाप्त कर, पुरातन पंथी सामाजिक रूढ़ियों से ऊपर उठ कर, एक राष्ट्र के रूप में उन्नति के लिए समर्पित था। आज सत्तर वर्ष बाद भी उनके शब्द कितने सच्चे प्रतीत होते हैं, जब उन्होंने कहा -

“We are at a momentous stage in the history of India. By common endeavour we can raise the country to new greatness while lack of unity will expose us to face calamities. I hope the Indian States will bear in mind that the alternative to co-operation in the general interest is anarchy and chaos, which will overwhelm great and small in a common ruin, if we are unable to act together in the minimum of common tasks.”

If there were to be a succinct definition of patriotism, here it was.

Incidentally, this echoes the current government’s overarching ideal of “Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas”.

Inclusion and welfare of all is at the heart of this concept of unity.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s legacy is timeless.  His words and deeds are eternal fountains of inexhaustible motivation. They can propel India to greater heights of all round development. If we ignore him, we do so to our own disadvantage. It would be unwise to heed his wise counsel.

In conclusion, I can do no better than quote Sardar Patel himself who gave our country a clarion call many years ago but one which resonates in our hearts as we try to collectively build a new India:

“Let not the future generations curse us for having had the opportunity but failed to turn it to our mutual advantage.  Instead, let it be our proud privilege to leave a legacy of a mutually beneficial relationship which would raise this sacred land to its proper place amongst the nations of the world and turn it into an abode of peace and prosperity.”

Let national unity be the ‘dhruva tara’ or Pole Star guiding us through turbulent waters of contemporary times. 

Let us have the resolve to build a stronger, united, forward-looking India in which each citizen feels secured and confident to lead a fulfilling and happy life.

We have to carry on the rich legacy of thoughts and action that Sardar Patel has bequeathed to us. We must preserve it through our actions and attitudes.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has called for developing a new and long-lasting vaccine to combat TB, which was one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide in 2018.

Inaugurating ‘The 50th Union World Conference on Lung Health’ in Hyderabad today,  he referred to the contention that the effect of BCG vaccine being  administered for TB does not last for many years and said there was an absolute need for a booster vaccine or a new vaccine that is effective and long-lasting. The four day Conference is being attended by the delegates from 130 countries.

He expressed happiness that the Indian Government has initiated trials for testing new candidate vaccines.

Calling for addressing various causes that spread TB, including poverty and overcrowding, Shri Naidu said that prevention was the most effective way to control the spread of TB and said that more efforts were needed in that direction. Lifestyle disorders such as diabetes also increase the risk of TB, he pointed out.

Stressing the need for improved diagnostics to detect TB in organs other than lungs, he said that TB treatment saved around 58 million lives globally between 2000 and 2018 and the TB mortality rate fell by 42% during that period.

Expressing concern over the rising incidence of respiratory and lung-related diseases due to air pollution, he observed that exposure to ambient air pollution could lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. 

Shri Naidu called for measures to arrest this pressing problem by adopting a multipronged approach to reduce emissions of harmful gases, especially which come under PM 2.5 levels. 

Quoting WHO data, he said ambient (outdoor air pollution) was a major cause of death and disease globally. An estimated 4.2 million premature deaths globally are linked to ambient air pollution, mainly from heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections in children.

Lauding the government for adopting a multi-sectoral and community-led approach to eliminate TB from India by the year 2025, Shri Naidu urged the private sector to step up its efforts towards achieving the goal of eliminating TB by actively collaborating with the government. 

Stating that Government of India was in the forefront of global action to end the emergency on account of the prevalence of Lung Disease and Tuberculosis, he said that the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has pledged a firm commitment to eradicate TB by the year 2025 

Referring to the positive outcomes of initiatives such as the Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) that brought down TB incidence in India at an annual rate of 1.7%, the Vice President said Public and Private sector must work together to reach out to more TB patients and provide them affordable treatment.

Describing Telangana as a dynamic and growing hub for innovative medical science and biomedical industry, the Vice President called upon the business leaders in the state to play a more pro-active role in supporting Research and Development in treatment, care and prevention of TB. 

Observing that non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart attack were accounting for huge spending by households, Shri Naidu said the problem could be surmounted to a large extent by ensuring Universal Health Coverage where every individual gets quality treatment without facing any financial hardship 

He said that programs such as AayushmanBharath were a step in the right direction to provide comprehensive insurance coverage to 10 crore poor and vulnerable families. 

The Governor of Telangana, Dr.TamilisaiSoundararajan, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Shri Ashwini Kumar Chowbey, the Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Govt of Telangana, Shri EtelaRajendar, Dr.Jeremiah, President of the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease, Mr.Louis Castro, Shri M.Venkateshwarlu, President, TFCCI were among those present at the event.

Following is the full text of Vice President’s speech - 

“Hon’ble Governor of Telangana, Dr.TamilisaiSoundararajan, Hon’ble Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Shri Ashwini Kumar ChowbeyJi, Hon’ble Shri EtelaRajendar, Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Dr.Jeremiah, President of the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease, Mr.Louis Castro, Shri M.Venkateshwarlu, President, TFCCI.

At the outset, let me appreciate the INTERNATIONAL UNION AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE for hosting this international conference of high significance in Hyderabad, a happening city known for its biryani and IT sector. Of course, modern medical infrastructure is expanding and turning this city into one of the major centres of medical tourism in India.

The theme of conference,‘Ending the Emergency: Science, Leadership, Action’ quite aptly focuses on what is needed to ensure commitments become action so that lifesaving targets are met. 

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB was one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide in 2018. It is also the leading killer of people with HIV and a major cause of deaths related to antimicrobial resistance. 

In 2018, there were an estimated 10 (9.0—11.1) million new TB cases worldwide, of which 1.1 million were children. 

India is among the eight countries that accounted for 66% of the new cases-- China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa are the other nations.

In 2018, it is estimated that about 1.5 million people died from TB. 

However, TB treatment saved around 58 million lives globally between 2000 and 2018 and the TB mortality rate fell by 42% during that period.

I am happy to note that the Government of India is in the forefront of global action to end the emergency on account of the prevalence of Lung Disease and Tuberculosis. 

As you all are aware, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has pledged a firm commitment to eradicate TB by the year 2025. It should be noted that India seeks to achieve the goal five years ahead of the globally agreed target. I am also pleased to note that the Government of India also launched ‘TB Harega, DeshJeetega” campaign and is adopting a multi-sectoral and community-led approach to eliminate TB by 2025.

I am told that the programs of the Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) have started yielding positive results and TB incidence in India has been coming down at an annual rate of 1.7%, although it is matter of concern that around 5.5 lakh cases went unreported last year. 

Under the National Strategic Plan for ending TB, the RNTCP is strengthening the private sector engagement to reach out to more TB patients. It is extremely important for the private sector’s involvement in notifying TB patients and improving treatment outcomes. I feel the private sector must not only step up its efforts towards achieving the goal of eliminating TB but must actively collaborate with the government in this regard. 

On its part, the Government of India is making all efforts to ensure affordable health care for all and bring down the costs of TB diagnosis and treatment. I urge the private sector too focus on providing affordable treatment for TB patients.

I am told that an estimated 4.2 lakh people died from TB which is more than HIV, AIDS and malaria combined last year. It is also understood that around 27 lakh people were afflicted with TB and nearly 10 lakh patients of these did not receive a diagnosis or an adequate and proper treatment. Around 3.00 lakh children under the age of 15 years acquired TB through contact with infected family members. This should not be allowed to continue any longer. 

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched a National Prevalence Survey to estimate prevalence of tuberculosis at national and sub-national levels. The Government has made some success during the last one year in case finding, drug resistance surveys and in providing nutritional support to TB patients.

Dear sisters and brothers, there is a need to address various causes that spread TB, including poverty and overcrowding. Prevention is the most effective way to control the spread of TB and more efforts are needed in that direction. Lifestyle disorders such as diabetes also increase the risk of TB.

I am told that the effect of BCG vaccine that is currently being administered for TB does not last for many years. There is an absolute need for a booster vaccine or a new vaccine that is effective and long-lasting. I am happy to note that the Indian Government has initiated trials for testing new candidate vaccines.

I am told that majority of people, who are infected, have innate immunity. Perhaps, in-depth studies could be take up to find out what protects them so that similar deficiencies could be addressed in people, who are vulnerable. Improved diagnostics are also needed for detecting TB in organs other than lungs,

Another major concern for all stakeholders in the health care sector is the growing incidence of respiratory and lung-related diseases due to air pollution. 

According to the World Health Organization, ambient (outdoor air pollution) is a major cause of death and disease globally. An estimated 4.2 million premature deaths globally are linked to ambient air pollution, mainly from heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections in children.

In children and adults, both short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution can lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. 

I am sure that all the specialists and experts, who gathered here, will discuss ways to combat this major global health problem.

I must also compliment the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease for providing technical assistance to the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) and the NSP. I would also like to appreciate it for bringing together key stakeholders from health, Government, the private sector, civil society and media for promoting the campaign- ‘Call to Action for TB Free India’ India. 

Dear sisters and brothers,

India has achieved considerable progress on various health indicators with successive governments according to high priority to health and the wellbeing of the people. The average life expectancy has increased to 69 years and many infectious diseases have also been successfully eliminated.

But the spread of non-communicable diseases, rising healthcare costs, lack of adequate medical facilities in rural areas and other factors such as pollution are posing new and formidable challenges. 

According to data released by WHO in 2017, about 61 per cent of deaths in India are attributed to non-communicable diseases, including heart disorders, cancer and diabetes.

There is a need to establish NCD clinics in both urban and rural areas and the private sector must play a prominent role in setting up such clinics.

Another area of concern that needs to be addressed is the shortage of qualified doctors and trained para-medical personnel in the country. It has been estimated that India was facing a shortage of 600,000 doctors and two million nurses. 

I feel that Public Private Partnership could be the model to bridge the gap in providing technically advanced primary and secondary healthcare centres.

Making available advanced treatment at an affordable cost to all sections is another aspect that needs the attention of all the stakeholders in the health sector. It should be a matter of concern that each year several people are getting pushed into the vicious cycle of debts due to out-of-pocket expenses and high treatment costs.

With non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart attack accounting for huge spending by households, this problem can be surmounted to a large extent by ensuring Universal Health Coverage where every individual gets quality treatment without facing any financial hardship. This is also essential to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.

I am glad that the Union Government has launched AayushmanBharath to provide comprehensive insurance coverage to 10 crore poor and vulnerable families. 

Telangana is a dynamic and growing hub for innovative medical science and biomedical industry. I call upon the business leaders to play a more pro-active role in supporting Research and Development in treatment, care and prevention of TB. 

I must also compliment the Hyderabad City Police and the Telangana government for launching ‘Smokefree Hyderabad’ campaign in the run-up to this conference. 

I  hope that this conference will provide continuing momentum in the drive to eliminate TB both in India and worldwide. This is a global emergency and we must all work together and learn from each other to achieve our ambitious goals to end the scourge of TB and lung disease

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today expressed concern over the rising pollution levels in several parts of the country and urged scientists and researchers to come up with innovative and out-of-box solutions to combat pollution. 

Inaugurating the ‘International Conference on Ions’ at CSIR– National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur today, he expressed concern over  the “poor” or “severe” air quality levels in most of the Indian cities. Quoting from the finding of the Centre for Science and Environment’s State of India’s Environment (SoE) Report, 2019, he said that air pollution was responsible for 12.5 per cent of all deaths in India

Stating that environmental pollution and deterioration in the air quality was among the foremost challenges faced by the country today, Shri Naidu stressed that one could not think about building a safe, secure, healthy and prosperous future when our cities, the engines of the growth are choking in noxious fumes and when water and soil are polluted.

Calling for immediate measures to reduce emissions, the Vice President stressed the need to promote clean and renewable sources of energy. He also suggested regular cleaning, preservation, and maintenance of water bodies, which were becoming toxic with increased urbanization and other related factors. 

Observing that a healthy and clean environment was an essential requirement to ensure sustainable development of all beings, Shri Naidu observed that environment degradation would have a direct impact on the development of the nation. Referring to the World Economic Forum findings, he said that the cost of environmental degradation in India was estimated to be Rs. 3.75 trillion ($80 billion) a year.

Observing that a number of studies have linked cancer to several environmental factors including pollution and radiation, the Vice President said that the second-most common cause of death in India after cardiovascular disease must receive attention from both doctors and policymakers.

He stressed the need to constantly innovate and create new, less invasive treatment protocols for cancer that were affordable and accessible to common people. “Human health and wellbeing are fundamental to the progress of any nation. We must ensure that every citizen has a good quality of life and access to opportunities for growth and prosperity,” he said. 

The Vice President said that understanding environmental and health hazards associated with socio-economic development has become essential and urged scientists and technocrats to reorient their research towards identifying the cause and mitigation measures.

He urged upon the scientific community, researchers and scholars to encourage people’s participation in dealing with issues such as rising levels of pollution in Air, water and degradation of vital environmental resources. Shri Naidu said that it was essential that people were made partners in the developmental process of the nation in all aspects.

The Vice President launched the ""Jagruti Programme: Ek Samaj Ek Lakshya""  by unveiling the brochure during 15th International Conference and said that efforts must be made by the scientists and researchers to guide people especially the youth to adopt sustainable modes of living and provide them research inputs in local languages for better understanding of the common people. 

Dr. Vikas Mahatme, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha), Dr. Rakesh Kumar, Director, CSIR-NEERI, Dr. Sunali Khanna, Symposium Chair,    Dr. T.K. Joshi, Lead Expert, FSSAI, Ministry of Health,      Prof. Paul Tchounwou, Professor & Associate Dean, Jackson State University, Mississippi, USA and         Dr. H.J. Purohit,  Sr. Scientist, CSIR-NEERI were present at the symposium attended by distinguished delegates from the field of Metal Ions, Biology and Environmental Sciences.

Following is the full text of the speech – 

“I am delighted to be present here today at CSIR– National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) for the ‘International Conference on Ions’. 

Let me take this opportunity to applaud CSIR’s people centric and nation centric approach to science and technology. 

I am aware that NEERI, a premier laboratory of CSIR, has been focusing on environment and serving the nation for over 60 years. I commend it for its contribution to the industry and society and for playing an important role in  Environmental Science and Engineering for Sustainable Development.

I am glad to note that as a part of CSIR-NEERI’s responsibility to the society,  NEERI is organizing 15th International Symposium on “Metal Ions & Organic Pollutants in Biology, Medicine and Environment (Metal Ions 2019)” in association with several other organizations.

I am told that the symposium would highlight the challenges with respect to Air Quality and Health, Cancer Imaging and Therapeutics, Human Diseases and Environmental Pollutants, Risk Assessment and Remediation, Metal-based Nanotechnology and Toxicology, Metal ions in Radiation Response and its Modification, Role of Major and Minor elements in Health & Environment and Environmental Carcinogens and Adverse Impacts.

I also congratulate CSIR-NEERI for initiating a comprehensive public outreach programme “Jagruti-Ek Samaj, Ek Lakshya” on Creating Alliance for Rivers (AFR) and Initiate Water Literacy, which is indeed a need of the hour. 

I am sure that this conference will serve as a launch pad for new ideas and new solutions to the pressing health and environmental challenges of our time. 

For centuries, the power of science has propelled us forward. It has unlocked the mysteries of the natural world and driven human innovation. Robust scientific inquiry serves as the basis for progress by providing a sturdy, objective foundation on which to build capabilities.

Conferences like this serve the purpose of advancing the spirit of scientific enquiry and hence are of paramount importance. 

I am particularly impressed with the array of challenges that the conference is deliberating and pondering upon. 

Environmental pollution and deterioration in the Air Quality are among the foremost challenges the country faces today. 

We cannot think about building a safe, secure, healthy and prosperous future when our cities, the engines of growth, are choking in noxious fumes and when our water and our soil are polluted. 

The Air Quality Index measurements in most of our major cities constantly register air qualities that are “poor” or “severe”. Air Quality in Delhi yesterday fell in the category of “Hazardous” with PM 10 and PM 2.5 particle measurement indices soaring high. 

The Centre for Science and Environment’s State of India’s Environment (SoE) Report, 2019 finds that air pollution is responsible for 12.5 per cent of all deaths in India.

The numbers are indeed alarming and are a cause for great concern.

The government has commenced the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), a time-bound national-level strategy to tackle rising air pollution. 

The NCAP will be a mid-term, five-year action plan with 2019 as the first year. The main aim of the programme would be 20-30% reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 2024. 

The metal ions and organic pollutants present in the air we breathe are extremely deleterious to health. 

The CSE Report also estimates that 86 water bodies are critically polluted. Both surface and groundwater in the country are under stress. 

Groundwater is also facing overexploitation. There has been an unsustainable increase in the number of deep tube wells that has gone up by 80 per cent between 2006-07 and 2013-14.

It is a cause for great concern that as India grows and urbanizes, its water bodies are getting toxic. 

It has been estimated that around 70% of surface water in India is unfit for consumption. (World Economic Forum/Word Bank reports)

A recent World Bank report suggests that release of pollution upstream lowers economic growth in downstream areas, reducing GDP growth in these regions by up to a third. 

The World Economic Forum finds that the cost of environmental degradation in India is estimated to be INR 3.75 trillion ($80 billion) a year.

Countering pollution would require a spectrum of measures, from the small every day steps one can take, to ground-breaking innovations. 

The quantity and type of metal ions present in water determine the possible health and environmental hazards. Detection and removal of contamination from water in a cost-effective manner must be our priority. 

In addition to promoting clean and renewable sources of energy, we must also take measures to reduce emissions and clean massive emissions right at the source through filters, ion exchangers, electrolytic separators and catalytic converters.  

Scientists and researchers such as yourself must strive to innovate and find out-of-box and ingenious solutions to arrest this menace of pollution.  

My dear sisters and brothers, 

Cancer burden in India has also more than doubled over the last 26 years. It is stated to be the second most common cause of death in India after cardiovascular disease. 

A number of studies have linked cancer to several environmental factors including pollution and radiation.

The key to curing cancer is early detection, in which imaging plays a crucial part. We must also constantly innovate and create new, less invasive treatment protocols for cancer that are affordable and accessible. 

Human health and wellbeing are fundamental to the progress of any nation. We must ensure that every  citizen has a good quality of life and access to opportunities for growth and prosperity. 

The ultimate aim of all innovation and scientific breakthroughs must be betterment of the human condition, the alleviation of suffering and the promotion of stability, peace and harmony.

My dear sisters and brothers, 

India is now witnessing urbanization at an unprecedented rate. 

Villages and urban renewal and retrofitting program by the Government of India, popularly called as Smart City and Smart Village program, will never be successful if we neglect the environment and its intricacies. 

The understanding of environmental and health hazards associated with any socio-economic development has become mandatory and Indian scientists and technocrats need to orient their research towards identifying the cause and mitigation measures. 

Our Smart Cities must not only be home to smart infrastructure but also to smart sustainability solutions. 

To preserve our environment, Government has initiated various plans which are outcomes of rigorous brainstorming by the scientific community and policymakers in using a trans-disciplinary approach, much like this symposium.

The government introduced Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act (CAMPA) in 2016. It also established National Compensatory Afforestation Fund and State Compensatory Afforestation Fund the same year.

The Green Skill Development Programme was launched in June 2017 by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change. ‘Green skills’ refers to those that contribute to preserve and restore environment and create a sustainable future. Hence, the programme focuses on developing skills among the youth in the environment and forest sector.

The ‘Namami Gange Programme’ was approved by the government in 2014. Important achievements of this national program include creating sewerage treatment capacity, riverfront development and surface cleaning. The programme is being implemented by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) at the national level and State Program Management Groups (SPMGs) at the state level. Moreover, 63 sewerage management projects are implemented in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal.

But much more needs to done to ensure that our development is balanced with focus on environmental conservation. I do not, for a second, believe that the two goals are mutually exclusive. 

Development is ultimately for the welfare of the common man. This is a mandate that cannot be compromised. 

I hope that conferences like this will pave the way for a more environmentally and socially conscious development strategy. 

I declare the program and the symposia open and wish it a grand success.

Jai Hind!”

                Expressing concern over the functioning of parliamentary institutions in the country and erosion of public trust in them, the Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today unveiled a 15 point reform charter as the basis for a new political normal to enable effective functioning of the Parliament and State Legislatures. He dwelt at length on the present pitfalls of parliamentary democracy in the country while delivering the first ‘Arun Jaitely Memorial Lecture on Strengthening of Parliamentary Institutions in the Country’ at Delhi University today.

2.         During his 50 minute long account of the genesis of the Constitution of India and functioning of legislatures in the country, Shri Naidu enumerated several pitfalls that are adversely impacting the legislative institutions and suggested remedial measures. He called for a new political consciousness urging all the stakeholders to review their mindset with regard to their roles and responsibilities.

3.         Expressing concern over poor attendance in the legislatures and the quality of debates, the Vice President urged the political parties to ensure attendance of at least 50% of their legislators all through the proceedings of the Houses by adopting a roster system. This suggestion came in the context of Parliament being forced to be adjourned due to lack of quorum of the required presence of 10% of the strength of the Houses.  Responding to the concerns over stifling of the freedom of expression of the legislators due to issuance of ‘Whip’, Shri Naidu called for a review of the same so as to enable reasonable degree of dissent without impacting the stability of the government. The Vice President also advocated a thorough review of the Anti Defection Law to rectify the grey areas like incentivising legislators to resort to actions inviting expulsion from the party besides providing for time bound disposal of defection cases by the Presiding Officer. 

4.         Referring to the functioning of the Department Related Standing Committees that came into being in 1993  for detailed examination of legislative proposals, Demands for Grants and other select subjects on behalf of the Parliament, Shri Naidu expressed concern over declining attendance, lack of specialisation, limited tenure of one year, frequent hopping of Committees etc. Shri Naidu said that he would discuss with Lok Sabha Speaker the measures needed for effective functioning of these committees with longer tenure instead of the present one year, promoting specialisation by nominating the Members for a longer period etc. 

5.         Emphasising the need for well thought out and focused legislation with the participation of stakeholders, Shri Naidu proposed a detailed framework based pre and post Legislative Impact Assessment. He stressed that every legislative proposal shall incorporate a detailed account of social, economic, environmental and administrative impact for wider awareness and subsequent assessment of the effect of legislation on ground. 

6.         Conceding that the present ‘First Pass The Post (FPTP)’ system of electing people’s representatives is faulty to the extent that MPs and MLAs are being elected with substantially less than 50% of voter support, Shri Naidu, however, said that there is no alternative at present. He further said that the proportional representation being advocated in some quarters would lead to promotion of further social and political cleavages besides being not practical due to implementation issues. He noted that in the recent elections to the 17th Lok Sabha, a large number of Members were elected with more than 50% voter support which would further increase with the changing preference of voters based on developmental concerns. 

7.         Shri Venkaiah Naidu stated that ‘Parliamentary form of Government’ is one of the features of the ‘Basic structure of the Constitution’ and is accordingly beyond the power of Parliament to be amended as per the settled position in the matter.   He said that the alternative of ‘Presidential form of Government’ for India is no option by virtue of the same. 

8.         Referring to the long held perception about the role of caste, community, region and religion in influencing the voting preferences in the country, Vice President Shri Naidu stated that there is growing evidence to suggest the decline of such identity based voting but it needs to be completely stamped out.  “While the Indian public has been steadfast in patronising democracy since the first General Elections in 1952 with ever rising turnout, there is a need for new consciousness in the form of moving away from the remnants of identity based voting to that of development oriented exercise of voting preferences.”  Shri Naidu noted. 

9.         Shri Naidu underscored the need for the governments to be responsive to the concerns of the Opposition and the Opposition to be responsible and constructive during the debates and while criticising the government and opposing legislation. He said; “Frequent disruptions, Points of Order without a point, Adjournment Motions and interruptions betray political immaturity, exhibitionism, excessive fondness for the limelight and inadequate appreciation of the need to utilise the opportunity of serving the public interest. ”

10.       The other reform proposals of Vice President and Chairman of Rajya Sabha  include building consensus on simultaneous polls to let unfettered governance, enacting for reservation of women in legislatures, making rules that automatically take effect against erring members in case of interruptions and disruptions, regular publication of reports by the Secretariats of Legislatures on the attendance of Members and their participation in debates, doing away with the winnability as the sole criterion for selecting contestants by the parties to address the concern of rising number of legislators with criminal record.

11.       Lauding the contributions of Late Shri Arun Jaitely, Shri Naidu described him as a multi-tasker and multi-faceted genius. He further noted that Shri Jaitely, as both the Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the House for five years each in the Rajya Sabha made a significant role in the passing of several landmark legislations besides resolving stalemates on several occasions. He said; “In my view, Shri Jaitely during his long years in public life made a unique contribution to address the imbalance in the prevailing dominant political thinking in the country which was almost instutionalised for long at the cost of other perspectives. It required the zeal, ability, virtuosity and the power of interpretation and communication of Shri Jaitely to mainstream the hitherto dormant perspective based on Indian ethos and nationalism. He was in the forefront of further elaborating the concepts of secularism and nationalism as unifying forces in the Indian context. ”

12.       The occasion was graced by Prof. Y.K. Tyagi, Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi, Dr. I.V. Subba Rao, Secretary to the Vice President of India, Prof. J.P. Khurana, Pro- VC, DU, faculty and students from DU. Family members of Shri Arun Jaitley were also present at the occasion.

Following is the full text of Vice President’s speech – 

            Distinguished invitees, dear students, friends from media, brothers and sisters!

            It is a quirk of the fate that we all have gathered today for the first Arun Jaitely Memorial Lecture instituted by the Delhi University in the name of a distinguished parliamentarian, an young and established leader who passed away just a couple of months back. 

            On this occasion, I am overwhelmed by the memories of my long association of about 45 years with late Shri Arun Jaitely. He was a friend in need and friend in deed  in the true sense of it. We used to reach out to each other regularly every time it so warranted to benefit from the counsel of each other on matters of polity, public policy and issues, governance and functioning of Parliament. The untimely passing away of Shri Jaitely left a deep void in my life and so is the case for our nation. 

            Shri Arun Jaitely was a multi-tasker and a multi-faceted genius which made him rise to dizzy heights in a quick time. He left an indelible mark of his own on a wide range of issues concerning our nation’s public life which includes articulation of new ideological perspectives on major national issues with clarity of thought and force of articulation, that were his hallmark. 

            Shri Jaitely’s tryst with public life began as the President of the Delhi University Students Union and later his fight against Emergency in 1975. Given his innate abilities, he was spotted by the political leadership of that time  and became the youngest member of the National Executive of the Janata Party and since 1991 he was in the BJP’s National Executive besides holding several important responsible positions in the Party and the Government. 

            In my view, Shri Jaitely during his long years in public life made an unique contribution  to addressing the imbalance in the prevailing dominant political thinking in the country which was almost institutionalised for long at the cost of other perspectives. It required the zeal, ability, virtuosity and the power of interpretation and communication of Shri Jaitely to mainstream the hitherto dormant perspective based on Indian ethos and nationalism. He was in the forefront  of further elaborating the concepts of secularism and nationalism  as unifying forces in the  Indian  context. 

            Shri Jaitely excelled as a Minister of various ministries and departments. His contribution as Finance Minister of the country at a critical time and his stellar role in piloting the introduction and execution of GST was certainly the high point of his career. True to his convictions against corruption, he also piloted several legislations in this regard. Shri Jaitely emerged as an effective parliamentarian, in recognition of which he was chosen as the Best Parliamentarian for 2010. As the Leader of Opposition during 2009-2014 and as Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha during 2014-2019, Shri Jaitely played a significant role in passing several landmark legislations. He also played a key role in resolving the stalemate in the House on several occasions.  He was a true democrat and a staunch advocate  of effective functioning of parliamentary institutions in the country. Shri Jaitely was a great parliamentarian, ideal politician above all a great human being. He was an epitome of Integrity and a gifted orator. He was known for his ideological commitment and always practiced value based politics. He is a role model and his life is a guiding source of inspiration for budding politicians. It is only appropriate to institute a memorial lecture as a mark of tribute to the multifarious contributions of Shri Jaitely to the public life. It is also indeed appropriate that the first memorial lecture is on strengthening of parliamentary institutions in the country, for which he always strived for. 

 Friends!

            Coming to the theme of the lecture, let me now deal with India’s tryst with parliamentary democracy, its journey during the last seven decades including its pitfalls and the way ahead  for effective functioning of our parliamentary institutions. 

            When the Constitution makers, after three years of deliberations adopted the parliamentary democracy with voting rights for all in one stroke at the dawn of independence, questions were raised in several quarters  as to whether democracy will survive in India and will a dictatorship not be better for the country as it can make things work. These questions still linger on in a different degree. Our Constitution was also described as ‘un-Indian’ as it neither incorporated nor represented the genius or the ancient polity of India. 

            Several leading political theorists were unkind in questioning our political capacity while in due course, some others have defended our valiant efforts in embracing parliamentary democracy.  A.F. Pollard, reflecting the colonial and racial mindset  harshly said and I quote: “If the Hindu and the Hottentot, the Semitic and the Negroid Communities cannot work parliamentary institutions, it is on account of their political incapacity.” (unquote). One of the ablest parliamentarians of the country, late Shri H.N. Mukherjee took strong objection to Pollard’s comment and observed that the way ahead lay not in the abolition of representative institutions and electoral principles but in the conversion of these institutions from talking shops into working bodies. 

            It fell upon the renowned political thinkers W.H. Morris–Jones and Granville Austin to come to the defence of India.   In his seminal work based on the functioning of the first Lok Sabha, Morris-Jones countered the anti-India cynicism. He asserted that the charges that Parliament is un-Indian and will therefore not last; Parliament in India is a facade and Parliament is unreal because it cannot operate properly within the political categories that are relevant in India were not based on objective consideration of parliamentary traditions in the country. 

            Austin noted and I quote; “Time, therefore, as happily proved most criticism of the Constitution, ill founded.  That the Indian Constitution was an ably conceived and drafted document, showing a creative, if not an original, approached to the nation’s constitutional leads, we cannot justly debate. This is born out, if in no other way, by the success of democracy and parliamentary government in India, for it is quite possible to govern badly with a good constitution, it is nearly impossible to govern well with an inadequate one.” (unquote)

            Since the first General Elections in 1952, the so called poor and illiterate Indians who are alleged to  accept the hierarchical political and social morality have demonstrated their practical wisdom in delivering electoral verdicts from time to time in line with the transformation witnessed in the country. Voter participation has been steadily increasing since 1952.  The electorate have delivered shock verdicts on several occasions starting with the 1977 General Elections, delivering some home truths to the political class. Caste, community, region and religion are said to be guiding the voting preferences in our country. While some sociological studies assert that democracy reinforces the caste and other identities, there is certain evidence to suggest that they are on the decline. 

            Democracy has taken deep roots in the country even though there is scope for substantial improvement in the functioning of our parliamentary institutions. By now, it is universally acknowledged that democracy has survived in India overcoming several odds against the forecast of doomsayers. Paying tribute to this spirit of survival of our parliamentary system, late Shri Arun Jaitely once said and I quote; “In the last 60 to 65 years, we have demonstrated to the whole world that we not only survived but we survived to become a major power and a major force in the world. It is a tribute to our sense of nationhood, our heritage, our cultural personality and the deep sense of patriotism of the Indian people. It is a tribute to our parliamentary system that despite divergence, despite ideological differences, when it came to the call of nation, we all stood up and spoke in one voice.” (unquote)

Democracy and public opinion

            Parliamentary government revolves around the consent of the people through elected representatives. Parliament is an instrument for expressing public opinion and voicing public grievances; restraining the Executive and ensuring its responsibility and accountability to national sentiment and will.  Its core functions include constituent, legislative, deliberative and oversight of executive. Effectiveness of Parliament is contingent upon the degree to which it echoes public concerns on a range of issues ranging from the individual to the nation’s development and hence, it shall keep its eyes and ears open to the public opinion.   

The roots of parliamentary system lie in the democratic ideal and they have to be fostered outside the confines of Parliament and among the masses of the people. Unless the roots are vitalised and made to acquire self-developing potentialities, the branches of the system represented by  the Parliament and State Legislatures cannot draw the necessary sustenance. 

            Political thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham, Tacqueville, John Stuart Mill and James Bryce insisted that in the last resort, it is the public opinion that makes democracy work. Enlightened public opinion in their opinion was the fulcrum of a thriving democracy. The two institutions that were assigned of making public opinion enlightened are political parties and the media. Ironically, both have not done enough in this regard.  Political class need to more effectively engage with the public so as to evolve a new and higher level of consciousness that is required for effective functioning of Parliament and other legislatives by understanding their concerns and aspirations and mainstreaming them into effective law making. 

            Parliamentary democracy thrives only when the electorate is mature, informed, intelligent and vigilant, and that can be done only by intensive and continuous education of the public of their obligations and rights as citizens of a democratic republic. Media has an important role to play in this regard. 

            While the Indian public has been steadfast in patronising democracy since the first General Elections in 1952 with ever rising turn out, there is a need for a new consciousness in the form of moving away from the remnants of identity based voting to that of development oriented exercise of voting preferences. 

            Parliament and other legislatures shall augment their outreach to the public by harnessing the rising availability of Information and Communication Technologies   (ICT) for the much required two way communication between the parliamentary institutions and their patrons.  

Supremacy of Parliament

            There has been a raging debate over the power of Parliament in amending the Constitution of India under Article 368 of the Constitution. Our Constitution incorporated provisions from that of some other countries but it is primarily based on the west minister model.  Political commentator A.V. Dicey stated that in the United Kingdom the Parliament is supreme and this was further illustrated by De Lolme saying that the British Parliament can do anything except making a man a woman and a woman a man.  This is not, however,  the case in India as our Constitution provides a clear framework of roles and responsibilities among the three organs of State i.e. the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. 

            According to M.N. Kaul and S.L. Shakdhar, Parliament’s legislative authority is circumscribed by the division of powers between the Centre and the States and by the presence of Fundamental Rights and a significant provision for judicial review.  

            After an uneasy truce between the Parliament and the Judiciary with regards to the power to amend the Constitution, the position is now by and large settled. The Supreme Court in 1965 held that the Parliament has all the powers to amend the Constitution but revised its position in this regard in the Golaknath Case in 1967 asserting that Parliament cannot amend the Fundamental Rights of citizens. This led to the 24th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1971 according  Parliament  full powers to amend the Constitution. Then came the verdict of the full bench of the Supreme Court in the Keshavananda Bharti Case in 1973 carving out the principle of ‘basic structure of the Constitution’ which it said cannot be altered  by the Parliament, without, however, listing the features of  this basic structure of the Constitution. The apex Court said the instrument of basic structure will be applied on a case to case basis. Based on the observations of the apex court from time to time, noted Constitution expert Dr. D.D. Basu identified 20 such basic features including parliamentary form of government. This being the second position, the Parliament and the Judiciary may move ahead with harmony.

            In the context of some debate in some quarters on the presidential form of government for India, I suggest that it may be left at that since parliamentary government  with the Prime Minister as the Executive head being a part of basic feature of the Constitution. All the stakeholders need to strive to enhance the effectiveness of functioning of parliamentary institutions for better delivery on all fronts. 

Functioning of legislatures

            The four fundamentals on which any democracy thrives are; majority rule, recognition of minority rights, constitutional government and governance by discussion. While democracy has taken deep roots in our country, there is still a large set of concerns that need to be addressed. Trust of the people in Parliament and other legislatures based on the responsiveness of law making bodies to the concerns of the people is critical for democracy and the conduct of legislators. There are certainly some concerns about this much desired trust.      

            Poor knowledge, low argumentative power of the masses, negative influences of poverty and economic disparities, faulty ‘First Pass The Post (FPTP)’ election system and society’s perpetual habit of accepting all permeable State to control public and private affairs are the sources of some concerns about the efficacy of our democracy. 

            On account of FPTP system by which   people’s representatives are being elected with much less than 50% vote share, some questions are being raised about the adequacy of representative nature of our parliamentary government reflecting majority will or the consent of the electorate. But at the moment, there seem to be no alternative since the principle of proportional representation will lead to much more social cleavages, multiplicity of political parties besides the practical difficulties in implementing such a system. I am glad to note that in the recent elections to the 17th Lok Sabha, a substantial number have been elected with more than 50% support of the electorate. I also tend to believe that as the electorate move away from voting based on 'Identity Quotient' to 'Development Quotient', more and more would win with the majority support of voters. 

            The present pitfalls of our parliamentary democracy are too well known to be elaborated. Briefly, these include the declining number of sittings of legislatures, persistent disruptions, declining quality of debates, growing number of legislatures with criminal record, high degree of absenteeism, inadequate representation of women, rising money and muscle power in elections, lack of inner democracy in functioning of the political parties.  

            The sixteenth Lok Sabha held 331 sittings during the five years while the Rajya Sabha sat for 329 days during the same period.  The declining number of sittings of Parliament from over 100 per year in the 50s and 60s to 60 to 70 days  per year later has been sought to be addressed with the introduction of Department Related Standing Committees in 1993. These Committees meet for about 30 days in an year taking up bipartisan discussions on legislative proposals, demands for grants, select subjects etc.  Eight such committees of Rajya Sabha have so far submitted about 1800 Reports on various issues. 

            However, the pitfalls of Parliament have slowly come to mark the functioning of the Department Related Standing Committees in the form of poor attendance, lack of specialisation, frequent committee hopping etc. which need  to be addressed. 

Parliamentary business is a complicated task and law making demands competence. Members of Parliament are supposed to discharge their responsibilities with dignity, diligence and discipline. Frequent disruptions, Points of Order without a point, Adjournment Motions and interruptions betrays political immaturity, exhibitionism, excessive fondness for the limelight and inadequate appreciation of the need to utilise the opportunity of serving the public interest.

With regard to disruptions, Rajya Sabha has lost 40% of the available time of the House during 2014-2019 while the sixteenth Lok Sabha during the same period lost 16% of the time.  

Emphasising the role of Parliament and the responsibility of the elected representatives to improve the quality of politics and governance while speaking on the occasion of the 60th Anniversary of the first sitting of the Parliament in 2012, late Shri Arun Jaitely said and I quote “People look upon both the Houses of Parliament to improve the quality of politics and governance. The power of politics is immense. It influences the life of a nation and, therefore, the stature of the men who man this system, must always measure up to the responsibility that the country vests in them. This improved quality of politics has to lead to good quality of governance.” (unquote)

Regarding the decline in the quality of debates and the efforts put in by the Members, Morris-Jones after studying the functioning of the first Lok Sabha commented and I quote “Some MPs who recalled the days of old Central Assembly claimed that Members then worked much harder and prepared their facts and arguments more carefully than is now the case. This may well be true; many of the present Members lack the experience, education and intellectual capacity for intensive study of the kind  that is desirable; and there is certainly  little anxiety to achieve elegance and polish in speech.” (unquote)

The decline in the quality of debates was so perceptible within five to six years of adoption of the Constitution. It is now rather ironical that with the number of literates and those with higher qualifications in the Parliament significantly rising from that of first Lok Sabha, concerns about the conduct and the contribution of MPs has become even more pronounced. Such decline coupled with blatant violation of the Rules of Procedure of both Houses of Parliament and the stipulated Code of Conduct is severely denting the standing of parliamentary institutions leading to erosion of trust of the people in these exalted law making bodies. This needs to be stemmed forthwith. 

Role of Parliament

            There is a huge confusion among the people and the MPs themselves about the role and functions of the Members of Parliament and so is the case with MLAs and MLCs. Legislatures are increasingly being drawn into micro-management of developmental works in their constituencies leading to an overlap with the domain of the Executive. MPs should  only be concerned with the issues  in respect of which Parliament has larger responsibility. They need to focus on aggregating the felt needs of the people they represent and seek legislative remedies to resolve them instead of associating with sanctioning of projects and their execution. They should avoid taking up individual grievances and instead seek to focus on larger community needs. 

            Renowned political thinker Edmund Burke once said of the national legislature in Britain and I quote; “Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different hostile interests, which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents and advocates; but Parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole; where not local purposes, and local prejudices ought to guide but the general good, resulting from the general reason for the whole.  You choose a Member indeed; but when you have chosen him, he is not a member of Bristol but he is a Member of Parliament. ” (unquote)

            Members of Parliament need to have clarity regarding their role and functions instead of giving in to the tremendous pressure from respective constituencies to attend to the locally felt needs of the electorate which is primarily in the domain of the Executive. MPs can certainly use their good offices to make the Executive address the pressing needs and problems of the people rather than being actors themselves.  There is a need for reorientation on the part of the MPs and more so, a pressing need for parliamentary reforms to restore the trust of the people in the parliamentary institutions. 

            Veteran commentator on the functioning of Parliament Dr. A. Surya Prakash came out with a comprehensive publication titled “What Ails Indian Parliament?” in 1995.  He observed therein that in no other institution is the resistance to self-examination, introspection and change as evident as in the institution of Parliament.  This must change. 

Way forward

            In the light of what I have stated, I would like to suggest a broad framework of reforms for further strengthening our parliamentary institutions so as to enhance the trust of the people in them.  


	Both pre and post Legislative Impact Assessment to be ensured for quality and informed law making for creating wider awareness about the targeted outcomes by bringing out social, economic, environmental and administrative impacts besides the involvement of all stakeholders in law making;
	Ensuring effective functioning of the Department Related Standing Committees of Parliament through longer tenures instead of reconstitution every year as at present besides promoting specialisation by nomination on the committees based on academic backgrounds and their renomination on the same committees for longer period. I would like to discuss this issue with the Speaker, Lok Sabha for further action; 
	Taking forward the legislation in the Parliament for reservation of women in legislatures whose representation  is at present only about 13%; 
	A minimum number of sittings for both the Parliament and State Legislatures per year to be appropriately  prescribed and compliance ensured;
	Law makers should abide by the Rules of the House and political parties to take responsibility in this regard by evolving and enforcing a code of conduct;
	Making rules that automatically take effect against erring Members in case of interruptions and disruptions;
	Political parties to evolve roster system for ensuring attendance of at least 50% of their members in the legislatures all through the proceedings of the House everyday to address the issue of  lack of quorum; 
	Secretariats of legislatures to publish regular reports on the attendance of members inside during the proceedings and the extent of their participation in the form of questions raised, debates participated in etc.;
	Legislature parties to ensure that the new entrants  and back benchers  are given adequate opportunities to participate in the debates instead of fielding only a select and established few;
	To evolve a new political consciousness under which tickets to contest elections will not be given merely on the criteria of winnability  by political parties to address the problem of rising number of legislators with criminal backgrounds;
	To review the functioning of the Anti-Defection Law to address grey areas like incentivising members to resort to activities that invite expulsion from the parties besides stipulating specific time frame for deciding on defection matters by the Presiding Officers of Legislatures;
	To review the functioning of ‘Whip System‘  which is being alleged to be stifling even reasonable dissent from the party position even on non-consequential matters and rationalise  the norms for issuing Whip to enable some degree of freedom of expression without adversely affecting stability of the Government;
	Setting up special courts/tribunals for time bound adjudication on criminal complaints against legislators and election related matters;
	Timely and effective action against legislators for non-ethical conduct; and 
	Governments to be responsive to the views and concerns of the Opposition and the Opposition to be responsible and constructive while resorting to the available parliamentary instruments like Adjournment Motions and during participation in the debates and both sides to avoid cynical and adversarial position just for the sake of it. 
	Consensus to be built on the proposal for simultaneous elections so that governance is not adversely impacted on account of staggered and continuous polls across the country and also to address the problem of rising money power in elections. 


Friends !

            Since 1952, the Parliament of India has played a significant role in the socio-economic transformation of the country by enacting several far reaching legislations. With the passage of time and with the growing inter-connected nature of the comity of nations and technological advancements, several new and complex challenges are staring at the young and aspiring India. Addressing these challenges underscore the need to address certain issues that are denting the functioning of our parliamentary institutions. Based on the experience of the last 67 years of our parliamentary democracy, we need to evolve a new normal for our parliamentary institutions so that our nation can make up for the lost time and opportunities. 

            My long time dear friend Late Shri Arun Jaitely  had always dreamt of this  new normal so that our country can fully harness its due potential.  All the stakeholders owe it to the people of our country to ensure better functioning of these institutions. 

            On this occasion, let me remind you of what Dr. B. R. Ambedkar said on November 25, 1949, a day before the Constituent Assembly finalised the Constitution and I quote; “The working of the Constitution does not depend wholly on the nature of the Constitution. The Constitution can provide only the organs of the State such as the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. The factors on which the working of these organs of the States depend are the people and the political class. Who can say how the people of India and their parties will behave? ” (unquote)

Friends!

            The question raised by Dr. Ambedkar is still to be answered. The only answer is that the people and the political parties shall rise to a new level of consciousness in all respects that forms the bedrock of effective functioning of our parliamentary institutions. We don’t have the luxury of time in this regard. Let’s make a quick beginning towards this new normal. 

            I compliment the Delhi University for instituting a Memorial Lecture in the name of late Shri Arun Jaitely.

            Thank you all!

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today said that the abrogation of Article 370 was an internal matter and that the move to bifurcate the state into two union territories was to ensure the overall development of both Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.

Addressing the delegation of more than 25 members of the European Parliament in New Delhi today, he said that abrogation of Article 370 was a step towards equity and human dignity. Shri Naidu observed that the move would ensure good governance where people enjoy the fruits of freedom rather than be constantly under the fear of the bullet.

The Vice President said that the proposition was put to vote in the Parliament on 5th and 6th August 2019 and it received Parliament’s unequivocal mandate. “The Lower House voted 80% in favour and in the Upper House, nearly 66% supported the Bill,” he added.

Stressing that Jammu and Kashmir has been an integral part of India since the acceptance or accession, the Vice President said that the Indian Constitution incorporated a provision under Article 370 according to special status to the State and that it was intended to be a transitory provision from the beginning.

The Vice President said that the special provisions and their consequences have been reviewed time and again over the last few decades and the Indian Parliament had debated the issue several times.

He said that it was widely felt that having an enclave within the country was not desirable and was seen as antithetical to an inclusive growth strategy where the country aims to bridge development gaps between states and achieve an equitable growth leaving no state behind.

Stating that the state was beset with a host of formidable impeding challenges like corruption, lack of accountability and most disturbing of all, growing threat of militancy and cross-border terrorism along with slow development, the Vice President said that the situation in the state after 70 years of Indian independence convinced the policymakers that they could not allow the rapid downslide to continue. He said that the Government, therefore, had to take the best possible steps for preventing any loss of life or property.

The Vice President said that it was to the credit of the Government that these measures have succeeded in full, as not a single bullet has been fired till date and there has not been any loss of life on account of any police firing.

He said that the restrictions were only temporary in character and relaxations were being given step by step and stage by stage.
The Vice President told the delegation that several steps have been taken by the Government to ensure smooth flow of information in the Jammu & Kashmir.

Talking about the recently held elections to Block Development Councils, he said that 98.3% voter turnout was an indicator for a very peaceful election.

The Vice President said that India wishes to see a more just, peaceful and responsive world order and that it was building a richly diverse, harmonious, democratic polity to ensure all-round development and inclusive growth.

Pointing out that India has believed in the principle of peaceful co-existence right from the Vedic times and that it had conceptualized the entire the world as one family, Shri Naidu told the EU delegation that India believes that peace was the pre-requisite for progress and wishes to bring peace to troubled areas, so that people enjoy a better quality of life.

The Rajya Sabha Chairman also told the visiting Parliamentarians that India was moving towards inclusive development with the Parliament playing the role of a catalyst and a proactive leader in this transformative process.

He also informed the delegation that India was keen on engaging with the EU on regional and global issues of shared concern and also for reforming the multilateral system and institutions to better reflect contemporary global realities.

The Following is the Full text of the Message:

“I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Deepawali.

Deepawali is heralded as one of the most significant festivals of India and is celebrated across the country and throughout the world. 

Deepawali or the ‘festival of lights’ is the celebration of the perpetual power of the good and its capability to conquer all evil. It tells us that truth and virtue alone triumph in the end. It inspires us to move from darkness towards light, from ignorance towards wisdom and from melancholy towards bliss.

Diwali is the harbinger of hope and beckons to us to take the initiative to light a lamp rather than cursing the darkness. It is also a celebration of the light of humanity that burns within each and every one of us that is capable of showing us the path of righteousness even at the darkest of the times. Deepawali urges us to keep this light burning bright so that we may continue to endeavor to build a better, more humane, peaceful and compassionate world.

May this festival bring harmony, prosperity and happiness in our lives.”

During his interaction with the four dignitaries, the Vice President stressed the need to further deepen India’s close relations with Afghanistan, Vietnam, Cuba and Venezuela in all spheres.

In his talks with Dr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, the Vice President emphasized that India and Afghanistan enjoyed close and friendly relations and added that people-to-people exchanges provided strong foundation to the strategic partnership between the two nations.

He stressed that India wished to see a stable, secure, united, inclusive and prosperous Afghanistan. He assured that India remained committed to work closely with the Government and people of Afghanistan in the development partnership as per the latter’s priorities.

Referring to the bilateral trade which is more than USD 1.1 billion, Shri Naidu said that there was immense potential for growth.

Congratulating Afghanistan for the successful conduct of the elections, he expressed the hope that the outcomes of these elections would promote unity, stability and peace in Afghanistan. 

The Vice President also expressed his support for the Afghan Government playing an active and central role in peace and reconciliation. 

He observed that stability and prosperity will come to Afghanistan only if the gains of the past 18 years, specially the constitutional order and the rights of women, children and minorities, are preserved.

The Vice President assured President Ghani that India would remain as a steadfast and reliable friend of the government and people of Afghanistan at all times.

The Vice President also met with Ms Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh, Vice President of Vietnam on the sidelines of NAM Summit & Ministerial Meeting in Baku today.

The Vice President spoke of the two millennia-old civilizational relationship and the historical bond of trust and friendship shared by the two nations.

Referring to his participation in the 16th UN Day of Vesak Celebrations at Vietnam in May 2019, he conveyed his heartfelt gratitude to the warm hospitality accorded to him in Vietnam. 

He expressed his happiness at the flourishing Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries with significant defence and security cooperation, economic engagement, trade and investments, cultural and people-to-people interactions.

Shri Naidu observed that Vietnam, which will assume the chair of ASEAN in 2020, was not just a trustworthy friend but a key pillar of India’s Act East policy and a very important partner for India in the ASEAN.

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today hit out at Pakistan for misusing the NAM summit “to justify its longstanding policy of conducting cross-border terrorism” against its neighbours.

In his address at the 18th NAM Summit here, Shri Naidu regretted that Pakistan President had misused the august forum and said “Indeed, we speak for the larger region in terms of this deep concern over Pakistan’s behavior”.

Stressing that Pakistan clearly needed to do much more to earn the confidence of the international community, the Vice President said “It must decisively abjure terrorism—for its own good, for that of its neighbours and for the good of the world”.

Shri Naidu also called for achieving a just, equitable and representative global governance system by reforming the United Nations, including the Security Council to reflect the contemporary realities of the 21st century.

The Vice President has urged the Non Aligned Movement to re-focus to remain an influential grouping and find solutions to challenges relating to terrorism, global governance reform, sustainable development and South-South cooperation.

He called upon all NAM countries to come together to forge a common front against terror in all its forms as there was no justification for violent extremist ideologies and terrorist actions that maim and murder innocents.

Pointing out that contemporary threats respect no borders, whether it is terrorism, climate change, pandemics, financial crisis or cyber security, he said that terrorism was the single most destructive threat, not only to international peace and security but to the very principles we are discussing today. “Their capacity to inflict damage has multiplied with the diffusion of information technology, giving terrorist organizations offensive cyber capabilities”, he added.

Calling for strengthening all international laws and mechanisms to combat terrorists and their enablers, Shri Naidu said the NAM partners should forge a common front by stepping up inter-agency coordination, exchanging information and strengthening the existing legal framework by endorsing the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT), proposed by India in 1996.

Addressing the Historic NAM Summit at Baku, in Azerbaijan, the Vice President said that the interdependent world today was faced with serious challenges. “Globalisation and unprecedented technological advances are shaping the 21st century in unpredictable and often disruptive ways. As we all strive to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth and a better future for our peoples, we must realize that our destinies are linked like never before”, he added. 

Assuring its continued support to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), India has asked the six decades old movement to reorient its focus to remain relevant in the context of the challenges of the modern world. India’s views on the role of the NAM in the present times was today articulated by the Vice President Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu while addressing the 18th NAM Summit at Baku, Azerbaijan. The theme of the Summit is ‘Upholding Bandung Principles to ensure concerted and adequate response to the challenges of the contemporary world’ .

The Vice President said that we must urgently find solutions to the development challenges of bringing health, education, clean energy and jobs to our people, amid a global economy being rapidly transformed by advances in technology. “These common goals can be achieved through a global governance system that is just, equitable and representative and a reformed United Nations”.

Observing that NAM need not position itself for or against any ideology or groups of nations, the Vice President said that “It is important that we do not waste our energies on issues that cause dissonance among us”. The Vice President said that the strength of ‘unity in diversity’ by pursuing a focused, positive, long-term agenda.

Shri Naidu urged NAM to select cross-sectoral challenges and work together to present solutions on issues such as terrorism, global governance reforms, sustainable development and South-South cooperation.

Highlighting India’s development agenda,“through everyone’s support, for everyone’s development and towards everyone's trust”, Shri Naidu said that India, as always stands ready to play its part and mentioned how India was partnering with other developing countries in capacity building, implementing development projects and providing humanitarian relief.

He said that India also took a major initiative in establishing the International Solar Alliance to give a boost to renewable energy generation and in setting up the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure

The Vice President expressed confidence that NAM grouping with its similar experiences and shared aspirations can certainly be a major force that can shape global responses to challenges as was done in the past.

Stating that India’s vision is one of collaborative endeavour for the common good of humanity, Shri Naidu said; “Let’s make our Movement (NAM) align with the overarching objective of improving the quality of life of our peoples. Let us be aligned with the forces of peace and development. This is the message that I bring to NAM on behalf of 1.3 Billion Indians. ”

He also said that India wishes to pursue a positive and forward-looking agenda to ensure a prosperous and secure future for all of us. “We are confident that NAM can play an important role in achieving these shared objectives”, he added.

The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu also interacted today with the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Dr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, his Vietnamese counterpart, Ms Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh and the President of Cuba, Mr. Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez on the sidelines of the XVIII NAM Summit in Baku, Azerbaijan today.

During his interaction with the three dignitaries, the Vice President stressed the need to further deepen India’s close relations with Afghanistan, Vietnam and Cuba in all spheres.

The following is the full text of the speech:

Mr Chairman,

Excellencies, 

Sisters and brothers,

            I am delighted to be among our friends here in Baku for this historic 18th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. 

2.        My congratulations to the Government and the people of the Republic of Azerbaijan for assuming leadership of our Movement at a critical juncture in its journey. You can be assured of India’s full cooperation and support. We look forward to working with you to ensure that the Movement remains effective and true to its founding principles. We also thank you for the excellent arrangements and hospitality extended to our delegation. 

3.        I would also like to felicitate the outgoing Chair, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, for its successful coordination of the activities of our Movement over the last three years.

4.        The theme chosen for this Summit, “Upholding Bandung Principles to ensure concerted and adequate response to the challenges of the contemporary world”, is timely. 

5.        As we mark the 65th anniversary of the Bandung Principles in 2020, and the 60th anniversary of the establishment of NAM in 2021, we must take this opportunity to introspect and reflect upon the NAM journey and its achievements so far, and what concrete steps we can take to make this Movement relevant and effective as it gears up to face the new challenges of the modern world.

Mr Chairman,

6.        Historically, NAM has played an important role in promoting global peace and security, and in voicing the hopes and aspirations of nearly two-thirds of humanity. It has imparted political impetus and moral direction to many important processes, including our shared struggles to end colonisation and eliminate Apartheid.  If we are to remain relevant, this tradition of independence must be defended and nurtured so that we set our own agenda.

7.        India has been a proud and integral part of this journey since the very beginning. We have fought shoulder to shoulder with our NAM partners to secure a more equal and just world order for our peoples. We continue our unwavering commitment and solidarity for the Palestinian cause.

8.        In the six decades since Bandung and Belgrade however, the world has undergone a remarkable transformation. Today we are faced with serious challenges of an interdependent world. Globalisation and unprecedented technological advances are shaping the 21st century in unpredictable and often disruptive ways. As we all strive to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth and a better future for our peoples, we must realise that our destinies are linked like never before. 

9.        The adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the global 2030 Sustainable Development Goals represent important milestones in recognizing the inter-linkage and inter-dependence of our actions and their impacts on our planet’s health. 

10.      Contemporary threats respect no borders – whether it is terrorism, climate change, pandemics, financial crises, or cyber security. 

Mr Chairman, 

11.      Terrorism continues to expand its tentacles with increasing impunity. This is the single most destructive threat, not only to international peace and security, but to the very principles we are discussing today. Its capacity to inflict damage has multiplied with the diffusion of information technology, giving terrorist organisations offensive cyber capabilities.

12.      The only way to fight this menace is to strengthen and implement, without exception, all existing international laws and mechanisms to combat terrorists and their enablers. No justification whatsoever can be accepted for violent extremist ideologies and terrorist actions that maim and murder innocents,  disrupt the very fabric of our societies, and stall developmental efforts. I call upon all our NAM partners to come together to forge a common front against terror in all its forms. We must do this by stepping up inter-agency coordination, exchanging information, and strengthening the existing legal framework by endorsing the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) proposed by India in 1996. All this is really possible when we have a clear commitment to zero tolerance towards terrorism.

On the subject of terrorism, our thoughts naturally go to its contemporary epicenter - Pakistan. We regret that earlier today afternoon, this August forum was misused to justify once again its long standing policy of conducting cross border terrorism against its neighbors, including the State of Jammu and Kashmir which is an integral part of India. Indeed, we speak for the larger region in terms of this deep concern over Pakistan's behavior. All of us in the Non Aligned Movement are focused on meeting our developmental goals and aspirations. Pakistan clearly needs to do much more to earn the confidence of the international community. It must decisively abjure terrorism - for its own good, for that of its neighbors and for the good of the world.

Mr Chairman, 

13.      We must urgently find solutions to the development challenges of bringing health, education, clean energy and jobs to our people, amid a global economy being rapidly transformed by advances in technology.  

14.      These common goals can only be achieved with a global governance system that is just, equitable, and representative. This necessitates early and meaningful reform of the United Nations, including a Security Council to reflect the contemporary realities of the 21st Century. We hope that the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations will finally produce concrete outcomes towards this goal.

15.      NAM countries need to work together to uphold the rules based global order and respect for international law. We must also ensure that multilateral institutions and regimes are working effectively for the benefit of our peoples.

16.      NAM must also keep pace with the changing times and refocus itself to remain a useful and influential grouping that can promote our interests on emerging global challenges.

17.      Our Movement was created to provide a platform for autonomy of policy for newly independent and developing nations, an objective that remains relevant today. We should demonstrate the strength of unity in diversity by pursuing a focused positive long-term agenda.

18.      For this, we do not need to position NAM as ‘for’ or ‘against’ any ideology or groups of nations. It is important that we do not waste our energies on issues that cause dissonance among us. We should identify select cross-sectoral challenges that require our immediate attention, and on which we can work together to present workable solutions. Issues that come to mind immediately are counter-terrorism, global governance reform, sustainable development, and South-South cooperation.

19.      Our countries share much in common, have similar experiences and shared aspirations, even as we represent diverse peoples, circumstances and levels of development. NAM is a large grouping that can shape global responses to such challenges, as we have done in the past.

Mr Chairman,

20.      As always, India stands ready to play its part. The underlying principle of India’s development agenda is “through everyone’s support, for everyone’s development and towards everyone's trust”. This approach also mirrors the essence of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, of leaving no one behind.

21.      A few weeks ago, in the UN General Assembly, the Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi outlined how India seeks collective efforts to address serious challenges facing the world through the new global platforms initiated by India.

22.      The Indian vision is a vision of collaborative endeavor for common good of humanity. As the Vedic hymn “Sangachadhwam” written about 4000 years ago suggests,” May our intentions and aspirations be alike so that a common objective unifies us all.” That common objective is the welfare of all our citizens. Let us make our Movement align with that overarching objective of improving the quality of life of our peoples. Let us be aligned with the forces of peace and development.

23.      This is the message that I bring to NAM on behalf of 1.3 billion Indians. 

I thank you.

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today said that Indian diaspora is a very important component of India’s aspiration to be an inclusive, equitable and prosperous nation.

He was addressing the members of the Indian diaspora of Azerbaijan in Baku today. 

Referring to the transformative changes, both economic and social, that are taking place in India as a result of concerted efforts by the government and the strong will of the people of India, the Vice President said that Indian ‘Diaspora’ formed the 4th ‘D’ in the quartet of ‘D’s that was propelling India forward, the first three being Democracy, Demand and Demographic Dividend. 

Shri Naidu reiterated that members of the Indian diaspora have a momentous role to play in the evolution, growth and future of the nation. “Through your connections with the local population here, you are well placed to identify opportunities, which will promote linkages between our two countries, not only limited to economic tie ups, but also to better understanding and appreciation of our culture and heritage in Azerbaijan”, he told the Indian Community. 

Referring to the historical civilizational linkages, strong cultural affinities and shared values of respect for diversities of other cultures that bound India and Azerbaijan together since time immemorial, the Vice President called for further deepening of ties between the two nations. 

Speaking of the steady growth in bilateral trade, the Vice President stressed upon the need to further enhance economic engagement between the two countries. “I can see many opportunities for Indian companies to engage with their counterparts in field such as Information and Communications Technology, pharmaceuticals, renewable energy, agriculture and food processing to name a few”, he added. 

Shri Naidu said that India and Azerbaijan have always been strong collaborators in the field of culture. He thanked Azerbaijan fortheir active participation in celebrating the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi on the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary. He also expressed his appreciation to the Government of Azerbaijan for releasing a postal stamp to mark this historic occasion. 

He said that the Government of India would continue to actively engage with Azerbaijan in the field of culture, to promote appreciation of each other’s cultures and to enhance people to people contacts.

The Vice President complimented the vibrant Indian community for contributing positively to the social and economic progress of Azerbaijan and for making a strong impression within the local business community through their hard work and entrepreneurial spirit. He also complimented them for their collective efforts in promoting Indian culture and heritage.

The Vice President said that Government of India considered it a priority to better connect and reach out to our overseas community and added that India had taken many steps to provide better services to our diaspora, including providing 24hour access and assistance to those in need. “There is a conscious effort to engage actively with our community around the world through digital platforms and social media, and these initiatives have borne positive fruits”, he said.

He urged the members of the Indian community to act as a living bridge between India and Azerbaijan.


	the slogan of Ministry of External Affairs : ‘Videshmeinaapka dost, BharatiyaDootavaas’, the Vice President expressed hope that  the Indian Embassy in Baku will be the first port of call for the members of the diaspora not only when they encounter a difficulty but also when they need guidance, assistance or even moral support in any of theirendeavors, or simply when they wish to feel closer to their country of birth. 


Apprising the community about the recent developments in Jammu and Kashmir, the Vice President explained in detail the rationale behind the abrogation of Article 370. “It is a step to extend to the people of the state all the benefits being enjoyed by the other Indian citizens. It is a step that was supported by an overwhelming majority in the Parliament. It is a step towards development”. Citing some distortions in certain sections of the media, he urged the diaspora to understand the issue in correct perspective. 

Underscoring India’s broad liberal vision of ‘VasudhaivaKutumbakam’ or that the whole world is one family, he mentioned India’s efforts to maintain cordial relations with all countries, including all its immediate neighbours. However, any attempt to disrupt peace and interference with our country’s internal matters will not be tolerated. “Peace”, he said, “is a pre-requisite for progress and we cannot allow anyone to derail the journey towards peace and prosperity”.  

The Vice President also conveyed his warm Diwali wishes to the members of the diaspora.

The Following is the full text of the speech:


	I am happy to visit Azerbaijan. I am delighted by the beauty of the city of Baku and the view of the serene coast of Caspian sea. I am also pleased to see you all.  I thank all of you for welcoming me and my delegation with such warmth and affection.
	I am extremely happy to see a vibrant Indian community, which contributes positively to the social and economic progress of this beautiful country. It is a matter of pride that you have excelled in your respective professions and became assets for this country. 
	Even though there are only about 1300 Indians in this country, your collective efforts in promoting our culture and heritage is well noticed and deeply appreciated by the local community. 
	I wish to congratulate each one of you and encourage you all to continue the good work. 


Sisters and brothers


	I am particularly happy that I am here on this historic visit to Azerbaijan because this is a country with which India shares civilizational linkages as well as shared values of respect cultural diversities. The ‘Ateshgah’ fire temple is a fine example of the age-old historical relations and cultural exchanges between our two countries. I am told that this 18th century monument, with a much older history, has wall inscriptions in Devanagiri and Gurmukhi, and is a surviving proof of the trade links and hospitality that Indian merchants on the Silk Route to Europe enjoyed in Azerbaijani cities such as Baku and Ganja. 
	In recent times, our engagement with Azerbaijan has deepened and diversified. The volume of our trade has multiplied manifold and Indian companies like ONGC Videsh have carved a niche for themselves in the oil and gas sector of the economy. 
	However, the present level of the economic engagement between the two countries is much below the potential. As Azerbaijan’s economy diversifies into non-oil sector, I can see many opportunities for Indian companies to engage with their counterparts in field such as Information and Communications Technology, pharmaceuticals, renewable energy, agriculture and food processing to name a few. 
	Under our Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, we share our experiences and knowledge with our Azerbaijani friends. Our experts in the field of women empowerment and rural development are also collaborating to forge new partnerships. 
	Our two countries have always been strong collaborators in the field of culture. I am very pleased to learn that the vision and the values of Mahatma Gandhi whose 150th birth anniversary is being celebrated across the globe this year, have found a distinct resonance here. I take this opportunity to thank all stakeholders in Azerbaijan and all of you for your active participation and contribution in celebrating the legacy of the Father of our Nation. In particular, I wish to express my appreciation to the Government of Azerbaijan for releasing a postal stamp to mark this historic occasion. 
	As the two countries intensify people to people contacts and deepen cultural collaborations, we look forward to your continued participation in this process. 
	I understand that the gift of ancient Indian tradition, yoga is taking deeper roots in this country. 
	Our music and dances are genuinely appreciated by the wider population here, so are Indian films. The Government of India is keen that we strengthen these bonds of cultural affinity and increase India’s cultural footprints to promote intercultural understanding and world peace. 


Sisters and Brothers


	I am happy to share with you the transformative changes both economic and social, that are taking place in India as a result of concerted efforts by the government inspired by Prime Minister Modiji’s advice of “Reform, Perform and Transform”. 
	Sustained reforms have ensured that India continues on its rapid path of progress. We have repealed archaic laws to improve ease of doing business. We have replaced “red tape” with “red carpet” in the way we approach potential business partners. With the implementation of GST, the concept of “One Country – One Tax – One Market” has become a reality. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is among the biggest and most impactful economic reforms undertaken recently in the country. The results are there to be seen.
	Doing business in India is not only lucrative to investors but is also becoming simpler. While India was ranked 142 in 2014, the recent World Bank Ease of doing Business rankings show that India has jumped 73 places and is now ranked 63rd in the world. 
	We also aspire to become one of the strongest economies in the world with a GDP of US $ 5 trillion by 2024-25. All this will be possible if we continue to work hard with resolve and be driven by commitment and creativity. 


Dear Sisters and Brothers,


	What I have mentioned will be achieved if we sustain and accelerate what we have done in the last five years. Through the Jan Dhan Yojana, over 380million bank accounts have been opened. This has ensured financial inclusion and enabled benefits to be transferred directly. The introduction of the Goods and Service Tax has integrated India as a single unified market paving a way for seamless transaction of goods and services across the length and breadth of the country. 
	India is also better connected today. With an average of 27 kms of national highways and 134 kms of roads being built every day, our villages are better connected and this will improve their overall economic activities. Air connectivity has also witnessed significant increase with an addition of 40 airports, India has emerged as the third largest aviation market. 
	We have embarked on many other ambitious projects which include building 100 smart cities, 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, 10 green field airports, 5 major ports and connecting our villages with broadband internet.  All villages in India have been electrified.
	The government’s flagship programmes, including Make In India for manufacturing, Skill India for skilling young India, MUDRA for microfinance, Digital India for greater digital connectivity, Ayushman Bharat for affordable health insurance, Swachh Bharat for clean India have produced outstanding results and have contributed significantly towards our goal of achieving sustainable and inclusive development for all sections of our society.
	Another step taken towards building an Inclusive India is abrogation of Article 370. It is a step to extend to the people of the Jammu and Kashmir region all the benefits being enjoyed by the other Indian citizens. It is a step that was supported by an overwhelming majority in the Parliament. It is a step towards development. I urge the diaspora to understand the issue in correct perspective as distorted versions are being spread by certain sections of the media. 
	India always believes in its age old philosophy of ‘VasudhaivaKutumbakam’ or that the whole world is one family and endeavours to maintain cordial relations with all countries, including all its immediate neighbours. However, any attempt to disrupt peace and interference with our country’s internal matters will not be tolerated. “Peace is a pre-requisite for progress and we cannot allow anyone to derail the journey towards peace and prosperity”.  
	You must have heard of the 3 D’s which stand for Democracy, Demand and Demographic Dividend. The Indian Diaspora is the fourth D and I wish to reiterate here that you are a very important component of India’s march to an inclusive, equitable and prosperous nation.


Dear Sisters and Brothers


	In conclusion, I wish to say that wherever I go, I have always emphasized on the important role, which you as members of our vibrant diaspora have in the evolution, growth and future of our nation. I am sure your would maintain the linkage with your motherland, your native place, your mother tongue and at the same time connect the land you are living in now with India. 
	On the part of the government, we have also made it our priority to better connect and reach out to our overseas community. We have taken many steps to provide better services to our diaspora, including providing 24 hour access to those who need assistance. Our Embassies have been directed to reach out to our diaspora pro-actively and render all possible assistance on a 24/7 basis, whenever required to any Indian citizen abroad or Person of Indian Origin. There is a conscious effort to engage actively with our community around the world through digital platforms and social media, and these initiatives have borne positive fruits.
	Let me end by wishing every one of you success and happiness in your personal life, families and at your work place. Let me also encourage you to continue to be a living bridge between India and Azerbaijan and continue to do your motherland proud with your hard work and achievements.
	I take this opportunity to thank the Ambassador and his team for organizing this interaction and giving me an opportunity to spend some time with you. 
	Thank you all for making India’s name shine bright in this country. In a couple of days we shall be celebrating Diwali – the festival of lights. Let me wish you and your families a very happy Diwali and hope that you will keep spreading good cheer wherever you go and live and contribute to a happy world. 


 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today said that India needs a scientific renaissance and cultural revitalization as both science and culture were essential for any civilization to flourish.   

Speaking at the closing ceremony of DHRUV, Pradhan Mantri Innovative Learning Programme that seeks to enrich skills and knowledge of talented children, the Vice President lauded DHRUV initiative and said that it would kindle the fire for excellence and innovation in young people.

Calling for institutionalization of DHRUV programme, the Vice President said that it should become a movement across the country. He said that there was also a need to create permanent forums like Science Museums, Science Labs, Dance and Music courses. “Theatre and art should be part of our school curriculum.  I hope the Ministry will take up this task in the future,” he added. 

Stressing the need to create the right conditions in schools, colleges and Universities for the spirit of excellence and innovation to thrive, Shri Naidu said that greater emphasis should be laid on quality education.

“I am glad that the DHRUV programme is focussing both on science and performing arts,” he added.

Observing that education should be holistic and propel children to move from narrow confines of competition to the limitless world of collaboration, Shri Naidu pointed out that the world we live in today is facing challenges from poverty to climate change. “Collective synergy and creative energy of our youngsters are needed to overcome these formidable obstacles,” he added.

Referring to the first batch of 60 DHRUV students- 30 of whom are exceptionally talented in science and 30 others are outstanding performing artists- the Vice President said that the collaborative efforts of DHRUV TARAS from science, mathematics and Arts streams under the guidance of their mentors will contribute greatly towards nation-building. “DHRUV TARA is one of the brightest stars in the sky. It serves as a guiding beacon to the travellers on high seas,” he said.

Under the DHRUV programme, talented students from science and performing arts from schools across India are brought together and mentored by experts to enhance their knowledge and skills. IIT Delhi in association with Atal Innovation Mission, NITI Aayog, NCERT, Sangeet Natak Academy, SPIC-MACAY and Center for Cultural Resources and Training, Delhi are involved in honing the innovative and creative skills of the students.

Shri Naidu witnessed cultural performances rendered by DHRUV students on the Journey of DHRUV,and watched a short film on the innovative scientific projects undertaken by them. Earlier, he visited a gallery displaying prototypes developed by the science students of DHRUV initiative. 

The Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India, Prof. K. Vijay Raghavan, Secretary to Vice President of India, Shri I.V. Subba Rao, Secretary, Department of School Education & Literacy, Shri Amit Khare, and other senior officials graced the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s speech – 

“मानव संसाधन विकास मंत्रालय की इस अनूठी पहल ' ध्रुव ' के समापन समारोह पर आप सब के बीच उपस्थित हो कर हर्ष का अनुभव कर रहा हूं।

मुझे हर्ष है कि प्रधान मंत्री इन्नोवेटिव लर्निंग प्रोग्राम ' ध्रुव ' के तहत प्रतिभावान छात्रों को पहचान कर, उनके ज्ञान और शिल्प को और प्रोत्साहित तथा निखारा जाएगा। देश के उत्कृष्ट संस्थानों में इन मेधावी प्रतिभावान छात्रों को, विभिन्न क्षेत्रों जैसे कला, विज्ञान के प्रतिष्ठित विशेषज्ञों द्वारा प्रशिक्षित किया जाएगा, जिससे वे अपनी क्षमता और प्रतिभा को पूरी तरह निखार सकें।

मुझे विश्वास है कि ' ध्रुव', इन मेधावी छात्रों के जीवन में नया परिवर्तन लाएगा, उसे नई  दिशा देगा। यह इन छात्रों को एक मंच देगा जिससे वे अपनी रुचि के क्षेत्र में उत्कृष्टता हासिल कर सकें।

I am delighted to be here today with all of you at the closing ceremony of ‘DHRUV’, a unique initiative of the Ministry of Human Resources Development.

I am glad to note that the Pradhan Mantri Innovative Learning Programme-‘DHRUV’, was started to identify and encourage talented children in order to enrich their skills and knowledge. In centres of excellence across the country, gifted children will be mentored by renowned experts in diverse areas, from science to performing arts, so that they can reach their full potential.

I am sure that ‘DHRUV’, will act as a turning point in the lives of extraordinarily talented students by acting as a platform for them to explore their talents and achieve excellence in their specific areas of interest.

In acknowledgment of the importance of recognizing and nurturing exceptional talent, the Government of India has already envisioned and implemented a number of schemes, such as National Talent Search Examination, Kishor Vaigyanaik Protsahan Yojna (KVPY), Maths and Science Olympiads, the INSPIRE program and the Atal Innovation Mission.

It is timely and appropriate to design a well-rounded program for gifted and talented children in India. We need to give our children the best learning opportunities. 

I am told that the first batch of ‘DHRUV’ consists of 60 students, 30 of who are exceptionally talented in Science and 30 of who are outstanding performing artists. I am happy to meet these 60 DHRUV TARAs from across the country. 

It is indeed noteworthy that these young prodigies, between 13 and 16 years of age, are being mentored by organizations such as NITI Aayog, IIT-Delhi, The Energy Research Institute, SPIC-MACAY, NCERT, Cultural Resources and Training Centre etc.

I am confident that the collaborative efforts of DHRUV TARAs from science, mathematics and arts streams, under the guidance of their mentors will contribute greatly towards nation building by envisioning locally relevant, easy to implement solutions to address challenges of poverty, unemployment, disease, agricultural productivity, energy conservation and so on and so forth.

Performing arts have the potential and innate power to connect with the masses. This power can and must be effectively leveraged to inform, educate and empower people.

It is clear that the students who have completed the ‘DHRUV’ program have gained tremendous exposure and diverse experiences. Let me congratulate each and everyone of you ‘DHRUV TARAs’ or Pole Stars on completing this coveted program.

The fascinating legend of Dhruva, who, as a young boy, observed long penance to achieve the exalted position of the fixed Pole Star is widely narrated all over the country.

‘DHRUV TARA’ is one of the brightest stars in the sky. It serves as a guiding beacon to the travellers on high seas.

I am confident that each one of you will shine as bright as the North Star, leading this country forward in its pursuit of inclusive, sustainable development.

The entire team of Ministry of Human Resource Development working efficiently under the able leadership of the Minister for Human Resources Development, deserves a round of spirited applause for not only conceiving this innovation but also for effective planning and implementation.

My dear Young Students,  

Excellence is never an accident.

It is the result of determined hard work and dedication.

Excellence is not a destination; it’s a continuous journey that never ends.

Innovation is critical for the progress of a nation. 

We must create the right conditions in our schools, colleges, universities for this spirit of excellence and innovation to thrive. 

We must place greater emphasis on the quality of education.

We must create a culture of excellence.

I am glad that the Dhruv programme is focussing both on science and performing arts.

Education should be holistic. It should cover head, heart and hand. 

Education must propel our children to move from the narrow confines of competition to the limitless world of collaboration.

The world that we live in today faces challenges from poverty to climate change. Collective synergy and creative energy of our youngsters is needed to overcome these formidable obstacles. 

I strongly believe that this excellence that we nurture in our educational institutions must fuel inclusive growth, peace and harmony.

I am confident that unique initiatives such as ‘DHRUV’ will help in kindling the fire for excellence and innovation in young people. 

Both science and culture are essential for any civilization to flourish. Today’s India needs a scientific and technological renaissance as well as a cultural revitalization.

मुझे आशा है कि ध्रुव की सफलता, इन मेधावी छात्रों को प्रशिक्षित करने के लिए, एक स्थाई संस्थागत कार्यक्रम बनाने का मार्ग प्रशस्त करेगी। ऐसे अनुकरणीय कार्यक्रम हर स्कूल, हर कॉलेज में किए जाने चाहिए, जिससे अधिक से अधिक मेधावी छात्रों को उत्कृष्टता हासिल करने के अवसर मिल सकें।

I hope that the success of ‘DHRUV’ will lead to the establishment of a permanent program to mentor exceptionally talented young people. 

Every student is unique. We have to recognise that talent and foster it. We must have schools that encourage creativity. 

This programme was some sort of a pilot. We now need to institutionalize it.  We need to create permanent forums like science museums, science labs, dance and music classes. Theatre and art should be part of our school curriculum.  I hope the Ministry will take up this task in the future. 

मुझे विश्वास है कि आज के सभी ' ध्रुव तारे ' भविष्य में अपने रुचि के चुने हुए क्षेत्र में उत्कृष्टता के मानदंड स्थापित करेंगे और दूसरों के लिए प्रेरणा का स्रोत बनेंगे। आपके प्रयास देश को उपलब्धि की नई ऊंचाईयों पर ले जाएंगे।

I am confident that all the ‘DHRUV TARAs’ present here will one day become inspirational leaders in their chosen fields. I hope the Minister for HRD, who is himself a poet, will ensure that there is equal emphasis on all aspects of education and that schools become centres of joyful, creative learning.

Only then can the nation be propelled to a higher trajectory. 

I am sure that the future of India is secure in the hands of its youth. 

I once again wish each and every one of these gifted youngsters all the very best. 

As we celebrate Diwali a few days from now, let me wish you a very happy Deepawali.  

I see before me a row of bright lights in each one of you here, lighting up our country’s future. 

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

Venkaiah Naidu will lead the Indian delegation at the XVIII Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to be held at Baku, Azerbaijan on 25-26 October. The Summit will be preceded by Senior Officials Meeting and Ministerial Meeting.

The theme for the XVIII NAM Summit is “Upholding the Bandung Principles to ensure concerted and adequate response to the challenges of contemporary world”. The Ten Principles of Bandung, a political statement encapsulating the need to promote world peace and cooperation were formulated at the Asian-African Conference in 1955. 

The theme is significant as it relates to the forthcoming 65th anniversary of Bandung Principles in 2020 and the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Movement in 2021.

India is one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which was established in 1961 with 29 members. It has since grown to 120 members to become one of the largest groupings of nation-states

The Summit will focus on a whole gamut of contemporary issues such as Terrorism, threats to peace and security, UN reform, climate change, sustainable development, economic governance and south-south cooperation.

The participation of the Vice President would further strengthen India’s engagement with NAM and its member countries.

The Vice President will deliver the national statement at the NAM Summit and hold bilateral meetings with other Heads of States and Governments including the President of the host country, on the sidelines.

In his interventions, the Vice President is expected to highlight the need for world community to come together to combat the threat of terrorism and the imminent  need to democratize and reform multilateral bodies like the United Nations Security Council to make them stronger and more representative. 

He will also address the members of the Indian community at a reception organized by the Embassy of India in Baku.

The Vice President will lead the delegation comprising the External Affairs Minister, Shri S. Jaishankar, India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Shri Syed Akbaruddin and the Secretary to the Vice President, Shri I.V Subba Rao.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called upon for making India Vishwa Guru and the hub of innovation and knowledge once again. “There was a time when India was known as the Vishwa Guru and students from distant countries came for education here”, he said adding that steps must be taken to bring back that past glory. Shri Naidu also stressed the need to reorient the modern education system to make it suitable to the 21st-century requirements.

Speaking at the first convocation of SRM University, Delhi NCR, in New Delhi today, the Vice President asked the youth to become agents of change and come out with innovative and sustainable solutions to the challenges faced by mankind. The youth should strive to build a New India, which was free of poverty, illiteracy, fear, corruption, hunger and discrimination, he said and urged them to play a key role in addressing important issues such as climate change and degradation of natural resources.

Expressing concern over the ill-effects of global warming and climate change, the Vice President stressed the need to avoid reckless exploitation of nature and excessive consumption.

“Sustainability has to be the new mantra. ‘Balance’ is at the heart of sustainability. And that ‘balance’ in all spheres starting with physical well - being is what yoga is all about,” he said.

The Vice President asked the younger generation to embrace nature and learn to live with it, without spoiling it. “We are only trustees of this planet and we must pass it on to future generations in all its pristine and natural splendor,” he added. 

Cautioning the youth to be aware of the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the Vice President opined that there was an urgent need to promote healthy lifestyles and food habits to combat the incidence of non-communicable diseases in the country. The Vice President advised the youth to take an active part in games and sports to stay fit and healthy. 

In this aspect, he lauded the Fit India campaign initiated by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and said that such campaigns must take the form of national movements involving everybody, especially youngsters. ‘Fit India is apt, timely and most needed,’ he added.

The Vice President said that integration of India’s traditional knowledge base and modern educational system was important to provide a holistic education. He said that the education system rooted in ethics and Indian values was the need of the hour, especially at a time when India was making progress towards building a knowledge-based society.

Shri Naidu further stated that students must be made aware of the great heritage, culture, and traditions of our country, and that they must learn to treat fellow human beings with respect. The Vice President stressed that education must help them to transform into responsible human beings.

“Apart from remoulding the syllabi and pedagogy, the stress should be on learning-by-doing,” he said.

The Vice President suggested a complete overhaul of the higher education system to transform Universities and colleges into centers of excellence. He wanted higher educational institutions to embrace advancements in technology, change teaching methods according to the needs of the modern requirements and create an environment for innovation to thrive. 

Observing that India’s quest to make it a global knowledge hub would be meaningless if it fails to provide the necessary infrastructure for quality higher education in rural areas, the Vice President wanted the government and the private sector to come together work towards bridging the urban-rural divide in higher education and skilling by providing affordable education. 

Here, the Vice President advised them to make good use of the increased internet penetration in rural areas and empower rural youth to stand on their own feet.

Following is the text of the Vice President’s address- 

I am very happy to deliver the First Convocation Address of SRM University Delhi-NCR. 

I congratulate the Founder Chancellor, Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, distinguished members of the board, faculty, staff, and students on having built a good reputation for SRM as a premier technology institute within a very short period. 

It is a momentous occasion for this University, its faculty and staff members, family members of the students and most of all for the students who are graduating today. 

We are gathered here to celebrate the successful completion of the challenge taken up by the students. I congratulate all students who are receiving their degrees today!

Dear students, 

The primary goal of education is to impart knowledge and develop the student into an enlightened individual. Education is not only for employment but for empowerment. It is the responsibility of a university to shape the intellect of the young minds that will one day steer the country towards progress and prosperity.

Access to quality education for all and at all levels is equally essential to ensure inclusive growth and prevent any kind of discrimination.

Time has come for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub. For that to happen, the seats of learning, especially the universities, must reinvent themselves as hubs of vibrant intellectual pursuit and as centres of resolute research and innovation

It is important to provide quality higher education that will not only increase the knowledge of the students but also enhance their skills so that when they graduate they become productive members of the society.

Always strive to gain knowledge, embrace technology, and adopt yourselves to the changing global economic and technological scenarios. 

Education is central to progress and development. It is a lifelong journey to gain knowledge and attain enlightenment. Real education must enhance the dignity of a human being and empower the students to become responsible citizens. 

Promoting social cohesion, brotherhood, compassion, caring for elders and the needy must become the sheet anchor of education. Our education systems should be in line with India’s belief in “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”

Such well thought out, forward-looking, value-based education system is the need of the hour. 

We need to reorient the modern education system to make it suitable to the 21st-century requirements. 

Ancient India has always had the tradition of holding knowledge in high regard and had built many centers of learning akin to modern-day universities for sharing knowledge.

As you all are aware, the Government of India has put out the draft educational policy in the public for suggestions to provide a holistic education. I urge upon the teachers, educationists, and others to go through it and make their valuable suggestions. 

Apart from instilling the spirit of inquiry and quest for knowledge, education system must enable students to become creative and innovative. It must build in confidence in them to take on challenges posed by the competitive world.

Educational institutions must incorporate skilling in their academic planning and allot adequate time and resources. One must remember that a degree without skills has no place in the technology-dependent world. 

Dear Students,

As you all are aware, higher education has a significant role in shaping up the future socio-economic structure of the country. A robust, quality professional education is essential to fasten a country’s path towards growth and development. 

Delivering quality higher education is one of the major challenges India is facing today. 

Estimates suggest that our higher education system is the world's third-largest in terms of students, next to China and the United States and Very soon, India would be one of the largest education hubs and learning destinations in the world.

Today India needs a world-class higher education system, a mission that is of paramount importance, especially in the light of the burgeoning youth population in the country.

India has one of the youngest populations in the world and the window of demographic dividend opportunity is available for five decades from 2005-06 to 2055-56, longer than any other country in the world.

As per HRD Ministry’s All India Survey for Higher Education (AISHE) report 2018, India’s Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher education in India is 26.3%,

The University Grants Commission has set a target to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to 30 percent by 2020 and the draft education policy aims to increase GER to 50% by 2035 from the current level.

We need to bring in significant changes in the higher education system to ensure 50% enrolment ratio in our institutions.  

Many factors including the unequal spread of private and public educational institutions, lack of adequate funding for research facilities premier institutions contributed to this low enrollment ratio in many institutions.

As per the recent study published by the Ernst & Young, India is reported to have 140 million young college-goers before 2030. Given the massive number, we as a nation must pursue structural and systemic changes in the education system, to produce better results especially in the field of higher education.

Our quest to make India a global knowledge hub would be meaningless if we fail to provide the necessary infrastructure for quality higher education in rural areas. Increased internet penetration, rise in reach of Information to rural areas provides a great opportunity to bridge the urban-rural divide in higher education and skilling.

Universities or higher educational institutions such as yours must become centers of excellence and create an environment for innovation to thrive. 

A complete overhaul of the higher education system is needed to inculcate values, morals and ethics in students. The New Education Policy should focus on the need to draft history with an Indian perspective. Similarly, various aspects of Indian culture, heritage, traditions and customs must also become part of the text-books.

Dear students, you are the future of this nation. It is important for you to inculcate Indian values, understand the great heritage, culture and traditions of our country. You must also learn to treat fellow human beings with respect.

Education must transform an individual into a responsible human being with social, moral and ethical values instilled in him or her, apart from making the person more productive.

Apart from remolding the syllabi and pedagogy, the stress should be on learning-by-doing.

Preserving India’s traditional knowledge base and integrating it with modern educational system is important as we rapidly advance towards building a knowledge-based society.

Everybody must strive to build a New India, which is free of poverty, illiteracy, fear, corruption, hunger and discrimination.

My dear youngsters,

It is a matter of great concern that India is witnessing an epidemiological transition.

Non-communicable diseases are on the increase.

In a 2017 report of India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), it has been observed that the disease burden due to communicable, diseases, dropped from 61 per cent to 33 per cent between 1990 and 2016 and in the same period, disease burden from non-communicable diseases increased from 30 per cent to 55 per cent.

This is a deeply disturbing trend and we must arrest this by educating the youth on the ill effects of the changing lifestyles and food habits.

There is a need to promote healthy lifestyles and combat growing incidence of non-communicable diseases in the country.

We need to avoid reckless exploitation of nature and excessive consumption. Sustainability has to be the new mantra. ‘Balance’ is at the heart of sustainability. And that ‘balance’ in all spheres starting with physical well - being is what yoga is all about.

You must take active part in games and sports to stay fit and healthy. Sports plays an important role in terms of individual development, community development, social inclusiveness and economic development.

I advise everyone, particularly the youngsters to say no to junk food which is causing harm to their health and affecting quality of life. Fit India call given by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi should become a national movement. ‘Fit India is apt, timely and most needed’.

Dear students, all of must become agents of change. You must find solutions to pressing problems such as climate change.

India is a key player in the world in addressing climate change and biodiversity loss.

India should show the way to the rest of the world in addressing the challenges of climate change by coming out with innovative and sustainable solutions. You must embrace nature and learn to live with it, without spoiling it. We are only trustees of this planet and we must pass it on to future generations in all its pristine and natural splendour. 

I was delighted to know that research scholars and faculty members of this university have taken the initiative to find solutions for diseases.

I appreciate the management and faculty for organizing medical check-ups for the poor and the needy of the nearby area. 

All of you have been fortunate to be a part of this wonderful institution. Dear students, a world of opportunity awaits you but you must carry your learning with humility and use it in service of society and nation which will be the true test of learning.

Best wishes to you.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu called for writing the history with Indian perspective and Indian values saying that, ‘British historians never accepted 1857 as first war for Independence, and tried to portray it merely as ‘sepoy mutiny’. Elaborating further, Shri Naidu said that the Britishers had their own vested interests to exploit India and History became a tool for them to achieve this aim. He also said that our education system should also reflect Indian culture and traditions. The Vice President made these remarks while addressing the students from Delhi Tamil Students Association in New Delhi today.

Highlighting the fact that more than 19,500 languages or dialects are spoken in India as mother tongues, Shri Naidu emphasised the need for cherishing this rich language heritage. “India is a blessed country to have so many living languages and we should be proud of it”, he said. He also said that every child should get basic schooling in his/her mother tongue. This will not only result in better learning outcomes but also go a long way in preservation of our languages, he added.

The Vice President described the students as the future leaders of country and said that they should not only excel in their studies, but also remain alive to the issues facing the Nation. He asked students not to confine their learning to classrooms only and advised them to spend time outside, especially in the lap of nature. ‘Nature helps you become a better person … a considerate human being who is sensitive to the smallest creature,’ he said stressing the need to adopt a sustainable path of development.

Shri Naidu also asked students to remain physically fit by taking active interest in sports. He said that increasing burden of non-communicable diseases was mainly due to lifestyle changes and younger generation should be made aware of health benefits of traditional Indian food and Yoga. He appealed to youth to spread the message of Fit India Movement launched by the Prime Minister far and wide.

Recalling that once upon a time India was known as Viswa Guru, the Vice President said that India should once again become a Vishwa Guru and the hub of innovation and knowledge. For that to happen, he suggested transformative reforms in education system to prepare students to effectively face the challenges of the 21st century. He also asked students to keep in mind the mantra of ‘India First’ in their future endeavours.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address – 

“Dear friends,

I am very pleased to be among you all today.

I am happy to know that Delhi Tamil Students Association is doing good work for student’s welfare especially for the south Indian students studying in Delhi. 

Dear students,

You are the future of this country. You are the energy that would be leading this Nation tomorrow. So you should not only excel in your studies, but also remain alive to the issues facing the Nation. This will prepare you for your future leadership roles. It is a known fact that some of our greatest leaders learned their best lessons while fighting for country’s cause in their student life.

Since you are in your formative days, I would advise you to learn as much as you can… and that learning need not be limited to the books only. Rather I would like you to spend fifty percent of your time outside classroom. You need to go close to the nature. Nature teaches you best lessons. It helps you become a better person …a considerate human being who is sensitive to the smallest creature, not just human beings. Our development model should be such that it cares for the environment and follows a sustainable path.

In addition to this, I would like you all to be active in sports. Choose one or more sport of your choice and spend at least one hour in playground everyday. I still play badminton for an hour everyday ... even at this age. Your mind can not be fit unless your body is fit …. our ancient sages understood this and gifted us their great wisdom in the form of Yoga. Our PM has launched Fit India Movement and I call upon you to take it far and wide, to every person known to you. You need to inspire others by setting your own examples.

Young friends,

You should not only take keen interest in contemporary issues, but also have right sense of our past as well. History is not exactly what Britishers have taught us. They had their own vested interests to prolong their rule in India....to exploit its vast human and natural resources. Their policies were guided by this greed. History too, became a tool to achieve this aim. British historians never accepted 1857 as first war for freedom, rather they tried to portray it mere ‘sepoy mutiny’. Divide and rule became their principle. We need our own sense of history with Indian perspective and Indian values.

We need to make younger generation aware of the fact that our nation is a great repository of knowledge and wisdom and once upon a time was known as Viswa Guru. Our centres of learning such as Nalanda and Takshashila were world famous and knowledge-seekers from across the globe used to come and pursue their studies in those temples of learning.

Our ancient Gurukul education system with its Guru-Shishya tradition used to provide value-based and holistic education, which empowered individuals.

India should once again become a Vishwa Guru and the hub of innovation and knowledge. For that to happen, we have to drastically revamp the education system to make our institutions of higher learning and universities the centres of excellence with international standards. We need to completely overhaul the education system to prepare students to effectively face the challenges of the 21st century. We need an education system that transforms a student to become a complete human being, who is sensitive and filled with empathy for the weaker sections of society.

Dear friends,

I have time and again emphasized the importance of cherishing our rich language heritage. India is a blessed country that we have so many living languages. More than 19,500 languages or dialects are spoken in our country as mother tongues. We have to cherish this diversity, we have to nurture it..... we should be proud of it. I am of the firm view that every child should get basic schooling in his/her mother tongue. This will not only result in better learning outcomes but also go a long way in preservation of our languages.

Dear friends,

I am happy to know that Delhi Tamil Students Association provides scholarships to students who are economically weak and provides them a platform to excel. We all know that the rising cost of education, especially on the higher education front is a matter of worry. Education is a fundamental requirement and it must be made affordable. Today’s India is young and aspirational and we must create an environment for talent to thrive.

It is a pleasure to know that Delhi Tamil Students Association organises cultural programs in Delhi with an aim to imbibe a feeling that from 'Kashmir to Kanyakumari, we are one'. I hope you will keep doing good work for national integration and ‘India First’ will be your guiding mantra in all your future endeavours.

Wishing you all the best.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called upon policymakers and experts in the renewable energy sector to take steps to tap the vast potential of solar energy around the world and make solar energy affordable for all. He urged all the member nations of International Solar Alliance to develop solar resources and related technology so that their reliance on fossil resources is reduced.

Speaking at the inaugural of 24th SUN Meet - i-SUN CaP (International capacity Augmentation Programmes for the “Sunshine Countries of ISA” organized by the Indian Institute of Public Administration in New Delhi, the Vice President said that moving to renewables would not only ensure energy security but also help in protecting the climate and reducing pollution.

Opining that global warming and climate change were affecting every aspect of human life and that there was an urgent need to protect the environment and ensure sustainability in development, the Vice President said that all nations must harness renewable resources to overcome the challenges posed by global-warming, climate change and pollution generated from conventional energy sources.

The Vice President said that he wanted to see every house, institution and organization to have their own solar panels on rooftops to meet their energy demands and vastly reduce carbon footprint.

Observing that India has huge potential to become the leader in the solar energy sector, Shri Naidu expressed happiness over the way renewable energy resources have been developed in India.

Recalling that India and France were the founding countries of International Solar Alliance, the Vice President said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and former French President Mr. Francois Hollande initiated the project to combine the efforts of both countries to work against climate change and promote renewable energy in place of fossil fuels.

He said that the idea of a concrete road map towards sustainability had also been reiterated by the Prime Minister in the recent UN Climate Action Summit in New York. He said that the solar alliance would play an important role in realizing his dream of “Climate action: Time to Act Now”.

Shri Naidu said that the ISA’s vision includes undertaking joint efforts to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology in producing renewable energy across the globe and also to mobilize more than USD 1000 billion of investment by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy and pave the way for future technologies.

The Vice President lauded IIPA for signing an MoU with International Solar Alliance for capacity-building of its member countries in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation under ITEC-programme of Ministry of External Affairs.

Botswana also joined the International Solar Alliance by signing ISA framework agreement in the august presence of the Vice President and Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill & Entrepreneurship, Shri R. K. Singh. Ambassadors and representatives from more than 50 member countries of ISA attended the event. 

Shri T.N. Chaturvedi, Chairman, India Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), Dr. I.V. Subba Rao, Secretary, Vice President of India, Shri Shekhar Dutt, Vice Chairman, (IIPA), Shri Upendra Tripathy, Director General, ISA, Shri Surendra Nath Tripathi, Director, Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) were among those present.

Following is the text of the Vice President’s address- 

“Distinguished Dignitaries, Padma Vibhushan Shri T. N. Chaturvediji, Shri R. K. Singh, Minister of State for Ministry of Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Excellences, 

Sisters & Brothers,

I am delighted to have you all for the inaugural of the 24th SUN MEET of the International Solar Alliance. As you are aware, IIPA is an autonomous academic institution of national eminence for training, research and information dissemination in streams related to Public Administration. I am happy that IIPA has become an internationally-known premier center for Training and Research in Public Administration and Good Governance.

I am also delighted to know that IIPA has signed an MoU with International Solar Alliance for capacity-building of its member countries. IIPA is already engaged in capacity building of Indian officers as well as of many friendly countries in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation under ITEC programme of MEA.

I am sure that IIPA’s Centre of Environment and Climate Change will rise to the occasion and impart necessary training to the officials of the member countries of solar alliance in formulating their policies and programmes to generate solar energy.

I would also like to recollect that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and former French President Mr. Francois Hollande had unveiled the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in 2015. France and India are the founding countries of ISA along with 121 member countries. The project was launched to combine the efforts of both countries to work against climate change and promote renewable energy in place of fossil fuels. The idea of a concrete road map towards sustainability has been reiterated by the Prime Minister in the recent UN Climate Action Summit in New York. The solar alliance will be playing an important role in realizing his dream of “Climate action: Time to Act Now”.

ISA’s vision shows the way in this direction quite explicitly. It includes shared ambition to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology, mobilize more than USD 1000 billion of investment needed by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy and pave the way for future technologies.

The ISA will also identify opportunities to bring in prosperity, energy security and sustainable deployment for all the people.  ISA envisages to better harness the demand for solar technologies, innovation and capacity building, among others, to make solar energy affordable to all.  The idea behind the association is to develop solar resources in various countries to reduce their reliance on non-renewable resources.

Countries which have come together for the project will identify and address gaps in their energy requirements through a collective approach. Some of the short-term priorities identified are: Assisting member countries in drafting solar policies; Encouraging collaborations in solar resource mapping in member countries and the deployment of suitable technologies; Designing training programmes for students/engineers/policymakers and others; organizing workshops, focused meetings and conferences and working with ISA member countries to strive for universal access to solar lighting.

Clearly, all these actions require the capacity to assess the requirement and bridge the gaps in order to meet the energy requirements in each country.  This implies an effective networking and learning from each other. It is expected that the ISA member countries will also establish mutually beneficial relationships with several relevant organizations, both public and private sector as well as non-member countries. I have been informed that the ISA Secretariat has put in place a very effective governance structure of the Assembly, a Standing Committee, four Regional Committees and three Subject Committees for various areas.

I am quite confident that ISA will collectively address the energy challenges of tomorrow by scaling up the use of solar energy.  I welcome all the new Members to the family and I sincerely hope that with more members joining the ISA, a more equitable socio-economic order that respects sustainability will be established. I hope that the ISA will serve as a laudable vehicle towards this goal.

I am happy that IIPA has organised the “i-SUN CaP (International capacity Augmentation Programmes for the “Sunshine Countries of ISA”. As stated earlier, the idea behind the alliance is to develop solar resources in various countries to reduce their reliance on energy needs for fossil resources. The objective of i- Sun Cap is Capacity Augmentation of the sunshine countries and Documentation.

It is within this context that policymakers will formulate plans to augment the capacity for successfully tapping the vast potential for solar energy around the world. I am sure that based on international experience and lessons, focus will be on solar-specific good practices. Ultimately, governments can design a suite of complementary policies that aligns most appropriately with unique national circumstances and goals.

I am hopeful that the association of IIPA and ISA will go a long way to reach out to the ISA Member Countries in their efforts of capacity building on policy issues. I wish the 24th SUN MEET all success.

Thank you.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today presented ‘Most Eminent Senior Citizen Award’ to legal luminary, scholar and former Attorney General of India, Shri K. Parasaran at a function at the India International Centre in New Delhi.

Shri Parasaran was honored with the Award on the occasion of the Elder’s Day celebration of Age Care India, an organization working for the welfare of the elderly. 

Conveying his appreciation to Shri Parasaran, the Vice President said, “today, at 92 years, Shri Parasaran stands tall among the entire length and breadth of India in terms of knowledge of law, knowledge of Shastras, erudition and ethics and is rightly referred to as a ‘Pitamaha’ of the Indian Bar”.

He said that the Award was a fitting recognition of Shri Parasaran’s exceptional contribution to the field of law and justice as well as his extra ordinary personality and added that today’s event was a celebration of the incredible positive energy of a deeply spiritual legal practitioner, who has tried to blend both “dharma” and “nyaya”.  

Known for his erudition, discipline, hard work, honesty and ethics, Shri Parasaran’s legal canvas has been wide. With equal felicity, Shri Parasaran, throughout his distinguished career, had handled a wide array of cases-- be they serious constitutional matters or inter-State water disputes”, he added. 

The Vice President said that Parasaran ji embodied the ideal expressed by poet Kalidasa who had said, in the epic poem, Raghuvamsham, “ vruddhatvam jarasaa vinaa” or the ability to constantly grow in stature without growing old. “He continues to be an ever-passionate and tireless champion of causes dear to his heart”, he added.

The Vice President urged the present generation of lawyers to draw inspiration from Shri Parasaran and imbibe the qualities of professional excellence and ethical orientation which he personified. 

Pointing out that India was a civilization that has always been proud of the way we treated our elderly, the Vice President said that we have always given the most esteemed and respectful positions in the society to our elders.

Referring to the reverence enjoyed by the elderly in the past, Shri Naidu said that they were custodians of righteousness, traditions, family honour, samskara and wisdom. “We must build this inter-generational bond once again”, he added.

Expressing concern over the rise in the number of cases of children abandoning their elderly parents, Shri Naidu described this tendency as a social evil. “This is completely unacceptable”, he asserted.

Stating that many elderly persons were also facing neglect and physical, verbal and emotional abuse, the Vice President called for a change in the mindset and attitude of the society, especially the younger people, in the treatment of the elderly.

He said that children must feel it as their duty to take care of the elders. 

The Vice President also said that the New Education Policy must include aspects related to Indian tradition, culture, heritage and history to shape a better future for the younger generation and the nation. 

In his acceptance speech, Shri Parasaran thanked the organizers for bestowing the Award upon him and stressed the need to perform one’s duty with devotion and dedication, without looking into the faults of others. 

Former Governor of Jammu & Kashmir, Shri N.N Vohra and the President of Age Care India, Dr. Kartikeyan were present on the occasion. 

The Following is the full text of the speech:

I am happy to participate in the 39th Annual and Elder’s Day celebrations of the AGE-CARE INDIA organisation dedicated to the welfare of senior citizens. 

I am very happy to note AGE-CARE INDIA has been honouring eminent senior citizens with the ‘Most Eminent Senior Citizen Award’ each year.

While eminent jurist, Shri Fali S Nariman was honoured last year, another illustrious senior citizen, legal luminary, jurist, scholar and former Attorney General of India, Shri K Parasaran is being honoured today. It is a fitting recognition of his exceptional contribution to the field of law and justice as well as his extraordinary personality. 

Let me, at the outset, congratulateand convey my reverential appreciation to Shri Parasaran Ji for this honour!

After a brilliant academic record, Shri Parasaran has had an illustrious career during which he adorned the top positions of the Advocate General of Tamil Nadu, the Solicitor General of India and the Attorney General.

In recognition of his accomplishments, he was nominated, in 2012, as a member of the Rajya Sabha and was decorated with the honours of Padma Bhushan in 2003 and Padma Vibhushan in 2011.

Known for his erudition, discipline, hard work, honesty and ethics, Shri Parasaran’s legal canvas has been wide. With equal felicity, Shri Parasaran, throughout his distinguished career, had handled a wide array of cases-- be they serious constitutional matters or inter-State water disputes. 

Today, at 92 years, Sri Parasaran stands tall among the entire length and breadth of India in terms of knowledge of law, knowledge of Shastras, erudition and ethics and is rightly referred to as a ‘Pitamaha’ of the Indian Bar.

He was humorously referred to as the ‘super Attorney General’. Despite defending the Government in Court for decades, he did not shy away from voicing his views and disagreeing with the political leadership.

In 1985, as Solicitor General of India, he advised the Government not to act on the show-cause notice to demolish the Indian Express building as it was legally untenable. When the Government did not listen to him, he refused to defend the Government in Court and withdrew from the case. He offered to resign but his stature was such that not only was he kept in office, but was made the Attorney General two months thereafter.

Having numerous cases to his credit, he has dextrously handled complicated Constitutional issues. He has been considered to be indispensable by several Governments. His knowledge and experience is oceanic, and is widely respected by the Bar and the Bench. 

Judges have recorded appreciation for his “persuasive precision” in his legal arguments in Court on more than one occasion. For instance, in Maru Ram v Union of India, Justice Krishna Iyer observed, “We must appreciatively mention that he did tersely meet point by point, with persuasive precision, juristic nicety, case-law erudition and fair concession. His submissions have helped us see the issues in perspective and focus attention on fundamentals without being side-tracked by frills and frippery.”

I am delighted to share with you a quote of Justice Sahai who observed,in PMA Metropolitan v. Moran Mar Marthoma:

“Both the learned Senior Counsel, Mr K. Parasaran for the appellant and Mr F. Nariman for the respondents, without expression of any emotion, admirable understanding and respect for each other, with utmost congenial coolness and exemplary precision and clarity.” 

There can’t be a more eloquent testimony of the greatness of Shri Parasaran ji as a legal practitioner.  It is also worth noting that both the luminaries mentioned by Justice Sahai have been honoured by AGE CARE INDIA.

On two recent occasions, he was appointed as Amicus Curiae (friend of the Court) – one is Manoj Narula v. Union of India (wherein he propounded the doctrine of ‘constitutional morality’) and the other is Subramaniam Swamy v. Union of India (the defamation case).

A versatile personality, he is known for his love for cricket as well as Indian religious tradition. He was appointed on the Committee for Temple Reforms by the Government of J. Jayalalitha and was also a member of the Expert Committee to suggest remedial measures with regard to the alleged restoration of the idol at the famous rock shrine temple of Lord Muruga at Palani. At the age of 77, he travelled to visit the holy shrine of Kedarnath and Kailash – Mansarovar. 

His arguments are often peppered with scriptural references and anecdotes. His spiritual faith and belief is deeply interwoven with his legal expertise. Earlier, when rival parties approached him to represent them in the Ram Sethu case relating to the Sethu Samudram project, Sri Parasaran chose to argue against the Government and for protecting the Sethu. When asked why he was opposing the Government, he recalled the Kanda Purana which describes the Sethu. “It is the least I can do for Rama”, he told the Court.

Shri Parasaran also made a mark as a member of the Rajya Sabha and always used to make meaningful and constructive suggestions while participating in debates. Everybody used to listen with rapt attention whenever he spoke.

He is held in high regard by everyone not only for his knowledge and erudition, but also for his humility and generosity. It is a matter of pride for all of us that Sri Parasaran ji is admired and respected internationally for his contribution to law and jurisprudence. 

Dear sisters and brothers, 

Parasaran ji embodies the ideal expressed by poet Kalidasa who had said, in the epic poem,  Raghuvamsham, “ vruddhatvam jarasaa vinaa” or the ability to constantly grow in stature without growing old. He continues to be an ever-passionate and  tireless champion of causes dear to his heart.

We are a civilization that has always been proud of the way we treated our elderly. We have always given the most esteemed and respectful positions in the society to our elders.

Manu Smriti, one of our ancient texts has this statement: 

“If one serves the elderly with devotion, he or she is blessed with long life, sound education, fame and strength”.

We should take inspiration from these ennobling thoughts from the past and shape societal response to the the elderly.

In the past, the elderly enjoyed a place of reverence. They were custodians of righteousness, traditions, family honour and samskara and wisdom. We must build this inter-generational bond once again.  

Unfortunately, in spite of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007, the number of cases of children abandoning their elderly parents is on the rise. Apart from abandonment, many elderly persons are also facing neglect, abuse, physical, verbal and emotional and other forms of violence. This is completely unacceptable.

There is also a need to expand geriatric healthcare facilities in our hospitals. Senior Citizens have the right to barrier- free public places. They have the right to safe and quiet spaces for peer group and intergenerational dialogue. 

I am glad that the government has initiated many schemes like Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana, Integrated Programme for Senior Citizens and National Programme for the Healthcare of Elderly, apart from giving concessions in income tax and railways/ airlines travel.

Taking care of elderly is a societal responsibility. This must become the societal norm once again. 

Today’s event celebrates the exemplary achievements of an extraordinary  individual. 

It is a celebration of the incredible positive energy of a deeply spiritual legal practitioner who has tried to blend both “dharma” and “nyaya”.  

It is a celebration of the indomitable spirit of standing by truth and justice even when falsehood threatens  to cloud the vision.

It is the celebration of a person who demonstrates the truth behind the saying that “age is a mere number”.

I wish many lawyers take inspiration from Sri Parasaran ji ‘s qualities and the values of professional excellence and ethical orientation he has consistently adhered to throughout his career.

Jai Hind

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has urged civil servants to improve the delivery of people-centric programs like Swachh Bharat, Per drop more crop and Skill India so that the fruits of development reach the most deserving.

Addressing the 65th Annual Meeting of the General Body of the Indian Institute of Public Administration, in New Delhi today, he said that people’s involvement was vital in development activities.

Observing that Swachh Bharat was a classic example of societal transformation in which extraordinary results were made possible through active involvement of people, he said  “This is the kind of approach which seems to hold great promise in most of the societal projects”.

Stating that the bottom-up approach of grass-root level transformation by active involvement of citizens was the best way to achieve inclusive growth, the Vice President said that it was the same approach proposed by the father of the nation – Mahatma Gandhi to achieve Poorna Swaraj. 

Observing that Gandhi’s overarching vision of Poorna Swaraj could provide the inspiration for country’s relentless efforts to reform administration and transform governance, he said the primary objective of Gandhi Ji’s constructive programme was to ensure basic freedoms and a peaceful and good quality of life for all citizens.

The Vice President, who also happens to be the Ex-Officio President of IIPA remembered Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary and said that all of us need to introspect as to what extent we have imbibed Gandhi Ji’s teachings in our personal and professional lives.

Pointing out that India was growing at a faster rate than many other major economies of the world, despite the global slowdown, the Vice President expressed his happiness that India’s programmes to build infrastructure and connect India were going on at unprecedented pace and citizen services were improving in both reach and quality.

He said the government was keen to unleash the forces of growth and was not only making India an attractive investment destination but also making every Indian an agent of change.

He complimented the Government for focusing on human and social development and for providing better access to quality healthcare through Ayushman Bharat Programme and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY).

He also stressed the need to attach special attention on harnessing the inner talent and energy in the country to realize the demographic dividend and propel the country to move into a higher development trajectory.

Speaking on IIPA’s role, the Vice President wanted such institutions to become knowledge hubs and catalyze the transformative process. He expressed happiness that IIPA training, hitherto limited to the Central Government officers, has now expanded to the State Governments and Foreign Governments too.

The Vice President appreciated IIPA’s role in enhancing the development objectives and appreciated its various initiatives with several Ministries. He expressed hope that IIPA’s evaluations being done with scientific rigour will help the government to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency in all the programmes.

On this occasion, the Vice President also gave away prize to awardees in various categories and released various Publications.

The Chairman of IIPA, Shri T.N. Chaturvedi, the Secretary to the Vice President of India, Dr. I.V. Subba Rao, the Vice President of IIPA, Shri Shekhar Dutt, the Director of IIPA, Shri Surendra Nath Tripathi, the Registrar of IIPA, Shri Amitabh Ranjan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“As the President of IIPA, I take immense pleasure in presiding over this 65th Annual Meeting of the General Body of the Institute. I welcome all the eminent members, various awardees and other guests.

Friends, As the entire world celebrates the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi this year, I would like all of us to remember his timeless legacy and some of his thoughts on national development. For Gandhiji, “constructive programme which is designed to build up the nation ‘from the very bottom upward’, was the truthful and non-violent way of winning Poorna Swaraj”.

Ensuring that all citizens enjoyed basic freedoms and a peaceful and good quality of life was the primary objective of Gandhiji’s constructive programme.  

What goes into the constructive programme can vary with time as Gandhiji himself said.  

But what is important is the vision of national development.  

What is remarkable is the bottom-up approach of grass-root level transformation and active involvement of citizens in development.

This overarching vision can provide the inspiration for our country’s relentless efforts to reform administration and transform governance. 

Institutions like IIPA should be knowledge hubs, exchanging information and knowledge and catalyzing this transformative process. 

I am happy to note that IIPA has been making rapid progress over the years in this direction. It has done commendable work both in Capacity Building as well as in Research. The IIPA training, hitherto limited to the Central Government officers has now expanded to the State Governments and Foreign Governments too.

The Judicial Officers of the State of Uttar Pradesh are now being trained by IIPA along with officers of Indian Revenue Service and other central services. Foreign officials are also being trained by IIPA under ITEC programme of Ministry of External Affairs as also under other programmes, which is quite appreciable.

I am also happy to note that IIPA is collaborating with foreign government institutions in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France and the USA, among others. These efforts of IIPA are creating a culture of excellence and blending academic rigour with a policy orientation.

I am aware that IIPA, apart from imparting training, is working closely with various government departments and organizations in providing policy and research advisory. The faculty of IIPA are evaluating the schemes of Department of Post, Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, Rural Development, Ministry of Tribal Affairs and MeitY in a big way.

Similarly, the functioning of the newly created AIIMS in different states is also being evaluated by IIPA as also, the audit of Government hospitals of Delhi which is a commendable job.

I am also happy to note that Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India, has started a new Centre on Tribal research. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the Ministry of Commerce are also planning similar initiatives on service standardization at IIPA. Already the Centres of IIPA-- Centre for Consumer Studies (CSS) and Centre for Urban Studies (CUS) are enhancing the development objectives of the respective ministries. 

I welcome Shri S N Tripathi who has recently joined as Director IIPA. The Faculty and Officers of IIPA have been working hard and under the guidance of Shri Chaturvedi ji and the new Director, I am sure, they would be able to perform even better.

I have also learned that the financial condition of IIPA has improved in the last five years but its long term liabilities have also increased and have reached Rs.97 Crore. It is a matter of concern and we should find a way to improve the Institute’s financial situation. 

Since IIPA has been engaged in the evaluation of many schemes of the Government of India, its academic circle is fully aware that the focus of the current government is on people-centric schemes which can transform the lives of each citizen in the country. 

I am sure IIPA’s evaluations are being done with scientific rigour and are providing answers to key questions on the quality of programmes.  

India is moving fast towards major transformation. Despite, the global slowdown, our economy is growing at a faster rate than many major economies of the world. 

The programmes to build infrastructure and connect India are going on at unprecedented pace. 

Citizen services are improving in reach and quality.

Government is focusing on human and social development. Access to quality health care is being considerably enhanced through the Ayushman Bharat Programme and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY).

India is establishing a skill ecosystem that equips its youth, comprising two thirds of its population, with the skills required for the 21st century through the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY).

The draft National Education Policy seeks to enrich the human resources of the country. The focus is on fully harnessing the inner talent and energy in the country to realize the demographic dividend and propel the country to move into a higher development trajectory. 

Clearly, Indian government is keen to unleash the forces of growth and is not only making Indian an attractive investment destination but also making every Indian an active agent of change.  

Swach Bharat is a classic example of societal transformation in which extraordinary results are made possible through active involvement of people.  This is the kind of approach which seems to hold great promise in most of the societal projects.  

In the case of infrastructure projects, public-private partnerships seem to be a promising modality. Digitalization and simplification of archaic procedures seems to have streamlined service delivery. 

I do hope IIPA’s evaluations will help the government to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency in all these programmes. 

I also wish that you should collate best practices from within the country and abroad and prepare policy briefs for fostering innovation at various levels. 

Your research and evaluation studies must be shared widely and should become the basis for your training programmes.  

Ultimately, it is the successful implementation that is the touchstone of effective governance.  

We are painfully aware of the numerous gaps between the noble intentions of a good policy and a poorly executive programme. 

That’s the moment IIPA has to step in and play a constructive role. You need to identify the gaps in implementation, the inadequacies and inefficiencies. 

You must provide the requisite knowledge and skills to the personnel to bridge this gap. 

IIPA has a long history of over six decades as a premier think-tank. It has played a laudable role.  But we should not rest on our past laurels. 

We should reposition IIPA in the light of current and emerging challenges. We have to come up with a sound strategy for institutional reforms and make IIPA a fit organization to catalyse the new wave of governance reforms. 

I am glad that IIPA has a strong network of institutions at the State and local level as well as a growing number of distinguished alumni. We must build on this collective strength. 

I suggest that we constitute a small group of IIPA members to examine how we can make this Institute an even better resource centre for the country. I shall look forward to having a report of this deliberation in about three months from now. 

I wish to see IIPA set new ambitious goals in the next few months, benchmarking itself as one of the best institutions with similar mandate around the globe.

I wish to see IIPA becoming an active hub of knowledge-exchange, skill development, robust evaluation and policy advice. 

I again wish to thank all of you present here. 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today cautioned political parties against resorting to vote-catching populist measures on the eve of elections, as it would ultimately affect the expenditure on development.

Interacting with law students of Bengaluru-based law students at Upa-Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi today, he pointed out that strengthening democracy was in the hands of the people and added that voting was not only a right but a responsibility too. He urged people to keep in mind 4 Cs—Character, Conduct, Calibre and Capacity, while choosing their representatives.

Unfortunately, he said, that some people were trying to weaken democracy by promoting another set of 4 Cs—caste, community, cash and criminality. He said the people should make a considered choice while choosing their elected representatives.

The Vice President also favored holding of simultaneous elections to the State Assemblies and the Lok Sabha saying “it should be a one-time affair”. For strengthening grass-root level democracy, he said that there should not be any scope to the States to postpone elections to the local bodies on one pretext or the other. 

Shri Naidu said that lawyers were important stakeholders in ensuring that people have access to justice. “It is very important that justice reaches the last man as it forms the basis of a stable and prosperous society. Sense of injustice often leads to alienation and unrest”, the Vice President cautioned.

Calling for making the judicial processes more people-friendly, the Vice President said the law enforcement machinery and the justice dispensing structures must be accessible, credible, equitable and transparently even-handed. “There is a lot of ground we have to cover in this regard”, he added.

Referring to the heavy pendency of cases in various courts, he   said apparently, there were nearly 60,000 cases pending in the Supreme Court and nearly 44 lakh cases in the High Courts.“We need to take action to reduce this heavy pendency. Justice delayed, as is often said, is justice denied”, he emphasized.

Stressing the need to promote ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) mechanisms, he said ADR mechanism was generally faster, less expensive and could reduce pendency of cases.

The Vice President also said it was imperative to reform legal education and make it holistic, as lawyers would have to play the role of change agents or social engineers in addressing socio-economic challenges. They also need to address a variety of new crimes triggered by technological advancements and liberalization.

Observing that the Law of Torts has received scant attention in India, he said it protects people who become victims of negligence by another party. ‘’In many developed countries like the US, it is an important branch of law. All of us are aware of how pharmaceutical and tobacco companies have to part with huge damages if negligence is proved in the court of law. May be the time has come for us to invoke such liabilities in Indian context as well to protect the genuine interest of consumers’, he added.

 

The following is the full text of the speech:

 

I am extremely happy to be amidst all of you today. Meeting the younger generation is always a pleasure for me. It fills me with new energy, optimism ....and new ideas.

 

Since you all are studying law, let me remind you that most of our prominent freedom fighters were lawyers- Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Rajaji ... the list goes on. It would not be wrong to say that their deep understanding of law helped them see through the disempowered condition of Indian masses under colonial rule. They realised that Indian subjects were not being treated at par with their white counterparts. It was this deep understanding of equal human rights that propelled Gandhi ji to demand a seat in first class compartment in a train in South Africa. He was denied this right and pushed off the train and that is how ‘Satyagraha’ was born.

Indian constitution is a vast document – bigger than any other constitution in the world. This detailed document is again a testimony to the fact that a many of those who drafted it were decorated lawyers of their times.  It is a tribute to their vision and farsightedness that India is a vibrant democracy today.

I feel these examples are sufficient to highlight the role that a lawyer can play, rather should play in guiding and shaping the society. As lawyers, you will be important stakeholders in ensuring that people have access to justice. It is very important that justice reaches the last man as it forms the basis of a stable and prosperous society. Sense of injustice often leads to alienation. 

That is why my firm belief is that the judicial processes must become more people-friendly. The law enforcement machinery and the justice dispensing structures must be accessible, credible, equitable and transparently even-handed. There is a lot of ground we have to cover in this regard. 

The Chief Justice of India has recently talked about heavy pendency of cases in various courts. Apparently, there are nearly 60,000 cases pending in the Supreme Court and nearly 44 lakh cases in the High Courts. We need to take action to reduce this heavy pendency. Justice delayed, as is often said, is justice denied.

We also need to promote ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) mechanisms. These are generally faster and less expensive than going to courts and can reduce pendency of cases. Also, there are plans to make India the hub of international arbitration. This is quite doable as we have the right kind of human resource and expertise for this. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019 is the right step in this direction. 

Coming to the issue of reforms in legal education India, we do have a small number of outstanding law schools, but they generally remain islands of excellence amidst a sea of mediocrity. This makes it imperative to reform legal education and improve its scope. 

Law education during the British days was aimed at creating lawyers who could help the lower courts and high courts in the administration of justice. Now, the lawyers have to play the role of change agents or social engineers addressing the socio-economic under currents and conflicts. They have to address a variety of new crimes triggered by the technological advancements and liberalization. New types of cases like anti-dumping, intellectual property violations relating to patents, trademark etc need a holistic knowledge of economics of pricing, market conditions, how economic injury is inflicted by cheap imports into the host country, subsidy elements received by the exporters in other countries to undersell products in the importing countries etc. Legal education has to be alive to these problems to address the changing roles of a legal practitioner. 

To address these issues, we need to make legal education holistic in nature. In the present world, a lawyer has to handle cases of various nature and implications. For instance, cyber laws and intellectual property violations need a greater understanding of the technology, international laws, trade laws and a number of new areas and legislations. The introduction of five year integrated courses, to some extent, has addressed these issues, but I believe not adequately. It is not merely a base level knowledge that is required for handling such cases in a globalized world. There are many multinational corporations operating in our country. Our law graduates should have a good grasp of laws in other countries and be able to weigh the pros and cons in an analytical manner.

Also, an area that has received scant attention in India is the Law of Torts. Law of Torts protects people who become victims of negligence by another party. In many developed countries like the US, it is an important branch of law. All of us are aware of how pharmaceutical and tobacco companies have to part with huge damages if negligence is proved in the court of law. May be the time has come for us to invoke such liabilities in Indian context as well to protect the genuine interest of consumers.

In the end, I come to the issue of ethics in legal profession. We have seen many people complaining of unfair practices by some members of legal fraternity. This affects the image of legal profession as a whole. I call upon all of you to set the highest standards of professionalism and personal integrity in your life and become role models for others. I hope that as lawyers your heart will remain filled with empathy for weaker sections of society and you’ll do your bit to help them.

 

Wishing you all the best for your future endeavours.

Jai Hind!

                Seeking to expand India’s footprint and forge closer ties with Africa, the Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu concluded his tour to Comoros and Sierra Leone and returned to Delhi today.

It was the first-ever visit by such a high-level Indian dignitary to Comoros, an archipelago situated off the Southeast coast of Africa and to Sierra Leone. Shri Naidu was accompanied by Shri Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, Union Minister of State for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Shri Ramvichar Netam, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) and senior officials.

Upon Shri Naidu’s arrival at Moroni, the capital of Comoros, on October 10, the President of the Union of Comoros, Mr. Azali Assoumani broke the protocol to personally receive Shri Naidu at the airport.

In his first engagement in Comoros, the Vice President addressed the Indian Diaspora and urged them to join in scripting New India’s growth story along with three other Ds—Democracy, Demand and Demographic Dividend. He also invited the Indian diaspora of Comoros to attend the next Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas of 2021.

On October 11, the President of Comoros, in an extraordinary gesture of friendship, conferred the ‘Order of the Green Crescent’, the highest civilian honour of the Union of Comoros on the Vice President.

Accepting the honour “with utmost humility on behalf of 1.3 billion Indians”, Shri Naidu declared that he was touched by the extra-ordinary gesture and said: “a common vision unites us, a common ocean joins us--it is an ocean of friendship and a vision of growing together”.

On the same day, the Vice President held delegation-level talks and a tête-à-tête with Mr. Azali Assoumani. The two countries signed six MoUs for cooperation in various fields including defense, health and medicine, arts and culture and tele-education (e-Vidya Bharati) and tele-medicine (e-Arogya Bharati).

During the delegation-level talks, Shri Naidu asserted that the recent decision in regard to the re-organization of the Jammu and Kashmir state was purely an internal matter of India and does not change any external border. The decision was made to focus on accelerating development of Jammu and Kashmir, he added.

The Vice President called for enhancing defence ties in maritime domain between India and the islands nation of Comoros as part of collaborative security architecture in the Indian Ocean. “As Indian Ocean countries, our maritime security is interlinked”, he added. 

Shri Naidu also thanked the President of the Union of Comoros for the support in the fight against terrorism as well as for reforms in the UN Security Council, including India’s candidature for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.

At Moroni, Shri Naidu also addressed the Parliament and received a standing ovation for his speech.

Soon after his arrival in Freetown, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra Leone, Ms. Nabeela Fareeda Tunis called on the Vice President.

On October 13, the Vice President had a tête-à-tête with the President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Mr. Julius Maada Bio, and later held delegation-level talks with him and both the dignitaries witnessed the signing of agreements. Both the leaders exchanged views on multilateral issues and decided to build on the existing cooperation at UNSC and other multilateral fora.

Observing that our positions are almost identical on various international issues, including UNSC reforms and the need to combat terrorism collectively, the Vice President appreciated Sierra Leone’s role in international affairs, especially as the Chair of the African Union Committee of Ten on UNSC reforms (C-10 group). 

India and Sierra Leone signed 6 agreements to expand the bilateral relations in various fields and also agreed to push for UNSC reforms so that one-third of mankind residing in Africa and India occupy their rightful place in decision making bodies of the UN.

Announcing the decision to establish a High Commission in Sierra Leone, Vice President said that India has a special relationship with Sierra Leone. 

Declaring that India’s developmental assistance to Sierra Leone so far aggregated to US$ 217.5 million for various sectors including agriculture, energy, water resources and telecommunication, Shri Naidu announced a Line of Credit to the tune of US$ 30 million for Irrigation development in Tomabum to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production.

He said that decision was taken to reactivate the US $ 15 million Line of Credit for a potable water project. The Vice President also informed President Bio that India would be happy to offer line of credit for construction of a new President’s Office complex in Freetown.

The Vice President expressed his happiness on Sierra Leone joining the International Solar Alliance in which India is playing a leading role to enable rapid deployment of solar energy globally and to facilitate the transfer of technology.

The same day, Shri Naidu also addressed the Indian community and urged the Indian diaspora to effectively counter the disinformation on Jammu and Kashmir. “It is high time to take up a campaign to stop this disinformation”, the Vice President added.

Shri Naidu said the recent decision to reorganize Jammu and Kashmir was intended to extend all the laws and benefits of developmental programmes to this region and ensure inclusive and all-round development of the State.

Shri Naidu reminded the diaspora that India is one of the most inclusive and tolerant democratic countries in the world in which the interests of all groups including minorities are taken care of with empathy and deep appreciation.

On October 14, Dr. Mathew Sahr Nyuma, the Acting Speaker of the Parliament of Sierra Leone called on the Vice President before he emplaned Delhi.

This visit was the second one by the Vice President of India to Africa. Earlier in November 2018, Shri Naidu had visited Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Malawi as part of strengthening bilateral ties with those countries.

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today asserted that the reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories will promote inclusive development and reduce the negative impact of cross-border terrorism. 

Addressing the Indian diaspora in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, the Vice President expressed concern that one of India’s neighbors has been fomenting trouble in this region by aiding, abetting and funding terrorist activities. 

Shri Naidu said that several thousand people were killed in terror-related incidents and termed terrorism as the enemy of humanity. Terrorism has no religion, he added and urged the world community to unite in isolating nations which sponsor terrorism and ensure that funding for such activities was stopped. 

Hitting out at the negative propaganda being carried out on Jammu and Kashmir, he urged the Indian diaspora to effectively counter the disinformation by presenting the correct picture. “It is high time to take up a campaign to stop this disinformation”, the Vice President added. 

Shri Naidu said the recent decision to reorganize Jammu and Kashmir was intended to extend all the laws and benefits of developmental programmes to this region and ensure inclusive and all-round development of the State.

While pointing out that both the houses of the Parliament approved the move with an overwhelming majority, he said that some sections of the media and vested interests have been grossly distorting the truth.

Asserting that Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India, the Vice President said that the people of the state have been electing leaders in free and fair elections since1952. However, many of the programs were not reaching the citizens of the state because of special provisions of Article 370. “Government has taken a bold decision by following the democratic process of obtaining Parliamentary approval”, he added. 

Shri Naidu reminded the diaspora that India is one of the most inclusive and tolerant democratic countries in the world in which the interests of all groups including minorities are taken care of with empathy and deep appreciation. 

The Vice President said that India is  a country which had Presidents, Vice Presidents, Prime Minister’s, Supreme Court judges and Heads of Defence Forces drawn from most prominent minority groups.“We celebrate pluralism, multi-lingualism and multi-religious mosaic of thought, expression and practice”, he added. 

Referring to India’s growth story, the Vice President said that the country was making steady progress towards becoming a USD 5 trillion economy and the third largest consumer market in the world by 2025. “In addition to democracy, demand and demography-- you, the Indian Diaspora are one of the main drivers of India’s growth”, he added.  

Observing that India offered many opportunities for business, social enterprises and cultural connections, he invited the diaspora to join as knowledge partners and investors in India’s transformational journey.The enterprise and innovation of youth has made India into the third largest Start-up ecosystem in the world, he said. 

Stating the India was fast becoming a favorite investment destination for the world, Shri Naidu asked the diaspora to build a bridge that connects their motherland with the land they have chosen to live in. “You should contribute to the development of both countries and exemplify the true essence of Indianness-- which is caring for others and sharing your prosperity”, he added. 

He expressed happiness that the Indian community in Sierra Leone, though small in number has been playing an important role in promoting bilateral ties and creating opportunities for the economy and society. “It is a matter of pride for us that the Indian business community is highly respected. Today, Indian skills and professionals are much sought after here and elsewhere in the world”. 

The Vice President also lauded the community for continuing to nurture Indian culture and tradition and for celebrating various festivals. He asked them to follow the rules and regulations of their country of residence. 

Shri Naidu also said that the government of India had decided to establish a High Commission in Freetown to strengthen bilateral ties between the two nations and to serve the needs of the Indian diaspora.  He added that the government of India had also taken a policy decision to have greater focus on African nations and promote closer ties with them. 

Before emplaning to return to Delhi on the conclusion of his tour to Comoros and Sierra Leone on Monday, the Vice President also held discussions with Mr. Mathew Sahr Nyuma, the Acting Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Sierra Leone.

The Vice President was accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising Shri Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, Minister of State for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Shri Ramvichar Netam, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) and senior officials.

 

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am delighted to be with you this evening on this first high level visit to Sierra Leone. 

India shares close, warm and friendly relations with all African countries which are cemented by robust development partnership and a large presence of the Indian Diaspora. The engagement has intensified and there have been over 32 outgoing visits to Africa at the level of President, Vice President and Prime Minister in the last five years. Africa has been accorded the top priority in India’s Foreign Policy. I recently visited Botswana, Zimbabwe and Malawi and my current visit to Comoros and Sierra Leone will further strengthen relations with these African countries.

In my visits abroad, I always, and as a matter of priority, meet with our community. And I must say, it is indeed a special and warm feeling to meet our people, our friends abroad, and to share with them my thoughts and greetings from India.

We have been celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of our father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi worldwide and I am happy to note that the Sierra Leone Postal Department have released commemorative stamps on Mahatma Gandhi to coincide with our celebrations. I am very happy to note that you have been celebrating the Yoga Day regularly here.

 

Sisters and brothers,

Indian community in Sierra Leone has a long history. The first batch of Indians came here over hundred years ago. 

We had been part of the peace process during civil war in Sierra Leone. Four thousand Indian troops served in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) from January 2000 to January 2001. The Indian contingent of UNAMSIL accounted for 25% of the total strength and were the best-equipped among contributing nations.

I am happy to note that the Indian community in Sierra Leone, though small in number, has been playing an important role in promoting bilateral ties and creating opportunities for the local economy and society. Most of the community is involved in trade and manufacturing and some of you are engaged in the mining and trading of gold and diamonds. I am also pleased to note the existence of the Indian Mercantile Association, being the sole Indian community association in the country. It is a matter of pride for us that the Indian business community in Sierra Leone is highly respected. Today, Indian skills and professionals are much sought after here and elsewhere in the world. 

It is remarkable that all of you continue to nurture our culture and tradition. I am happy to learn that you celebrate Holi, Dushera, Diwali, Eid, Christmas and other festivals with much enthusiasm and pride. You would be celebrating Diwali in a fortnight from now followed by Eid and Guru Purab in November. I convey my greetings and good-wishes in advance for the forthcoming festivals to our Indian diaspora here. 

For many of you, Sierra Leone is your new home, for still others it is your karma-bhoomi. I am happy that you have been welcomed with open arms in your adopted country and in your professional spaces. India and Sierra Leone are multi-cultural societies. This shared uniqueness about the two would have been comforting to you as you settled down here, making friends, families and associations. You have made significant contribution to the well-being of this country. As entrepreneurs, doctors, teachers, bankers and technology experts, you are adding immense value to the Sierra Leonean society and economy. We are, indeed, proud of your achievements and your success.

 

Sisters and brothers,

I know you keep yourself updated with developments in India. Many of you visit India regularly. But those who travel after a gap of a few years will find a new India, a new experience awaiting you! Our growth and development mirrors a new confidence in the country. India is one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. We are making steady progress towards becoming a USD 5 trillion economy and the 3rd largest consumer market in the world by 2025. Our work on building next - generation infrastructure including 100 Smart cities, 7 high speed train corridors, 10 green-field airports, country-wide digital connectivity and thousands of kilometres of express-ways continues apace. 

India is on a transformative journey of high growth and socio-economic changes. The youth in the country are brimming with ideas and energy. Their enterprise and innovation has made India into the third largest Start-up ecosystem in the world. India today is full of opportunities for business, for social enterprises and for cultural connections. I invite each one of you to join us in our transformational journey. as knowledge partners and as investors. 

 

Sisters and brothers

In the last few years, you would have seen a sea-change in the way our Government is engaging and reaching out to our Diaspora. In addition to democracy, demand and demography you the Indian Diaspora are one of the main drivers of India’s growth.  There is today a stronger connect between India and the Indian community abroad. We have started schemes such as the ""Know India Programme” to better connect with our people abroad. Our OCI scheme has been made flexible so that more and more people can benefit from it. We have mandated our Embassies to be available round the clock to our people in need. And we are extending humanitarian assistance as and where required. We have reached out to those in dire need, from Yemen to Venezuela, caught in violence, crisis or natural disasters. And not just to Indians alone, but to people of over 50 other countries.

I am pleased to announce that we shall be opening our High Commission in Freetown shortly which would further strengthen the existing bilateral relations between India and Sierra Leone besides taking care of the needs of the Indian Diaspora staying in Sierra Leone.

We count our Diaspora as an important partner in strengthening our international outreach. You have a role to play in spreading the message of India. In our quest for peace, prosperity and development, Indian citizens abroad and the overseas Indian community serve us as equal partners. 

 

Sisters and Brothers,

The recent decision of the Government of India to reorganize Jammu & Kashmir was intended to extend all the laws and benefits of developmental programmes to this region and ensure inclusive all round development of this State. This decision was taken after the Parliament approved the move with an overwhelming majority in both Houses of the Parliament. Unfortunately, some sections of the media and vested interests have been grossly distorting the truth. Jammu and Kashmir has been, as you know, an integral part of India and has been electing its leaders in free and fair elections right from 1952. However, since many of the programmes were not reaching the citizens of this State because of the special provisions of Article 370, the Government has taken a bold decision by following the democratic process of obtaining parliamentary approval. In fact, this will be the foundation for an equitable, inclusive developmental process in the State and reducing the negative impact of cross-border terrorism in the area over the next few years to come. Unfortunately, one of our neighbors has been fomenting trouble in this region by aiding, abetting and funding terrorist activities. We cannot allow this to go unchecked. 

India takes pride in the fact that we have always believed that not only our country but entire world is one family. We celebrate pluralism, multi-lingualism and multi-religious mosaic of thought, expression and practice. It’s one of the most inclusive and tolerant democratic countries in the world in which the interests of all groups including minorities are taken care of with empathy and deep appreciation. It’s a country which had Presidents, Vice Presidents, Prime Minister’s, Supreme Court judges and Heads of Defence Forces drawn from most prominent minority groups.  

India is on the move and is fast becoming a favorite investment destination for the world. You as India’s ambassadors in Sierra Leone can build a bridge that connects your motherland with the land that you have chosen to live in. You should contribute to the development of both countries and exemplify the true essence of Indianness which is caring for others and sharing your prosperity. 

I shall be visiting tomorrow the Choithram Memorial Hospital being run by the Choithram Memorial Trust for the past two decades. I am happy to note that the hospital provides Comprehensive Medicare to the people of Sierra Leone. I am pleased to note that the hospital is committed to the highest standards of medical & service excellence, patient care and medical education to the people of Sierra Leone. i would like to share with you that the Government of India is also extending support for disabled patients by organizing “Jaipur Foot” camps under the “India for Humanity” programme organized to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. 

It has been a pleasure sharing my thoughts with you. I wish you all success in your endeavours.

 

Thank you.

This is the first ever visit of an Indian Vice President to Sierra Leone. 

 

India announced the decision to establish a High Commission in Sierra Leone, even as both the countries have agreed to enhance cooperation in agriculture, food processing, Information Technology, infrastructure development and capacity building. 

 

Earlier, the Vice President held a tête-à-têteand delegation level talks with Mr. Julius Maada Bio. Both the leaders exchanged views on multilateral issues and decided to build on the existing cooperation at UNSC and other multilateral fora. 

 

During the delegation level talks, Shri Naidu informed Mr. Bio that the recent re-organization of the Jammu and Kashmir state into two centrally administered Union Territories was purely an internal administrative decision without any impact on external boundaries of India. “The decision was taken to give a boost to socio-economic development in Jammu and Kashmir and to combat cross-border terrorism”, he said. 

Observing that our positions are almost identical on various international issues, including UNSC reforms and the need to combat terrorism collectively, the Vice President appreciated Sierra Leone’s role in international affairs, especially as the Chair of the African Union Committee of ten on UNSC reforms (C-10 group).  

The Vice President said that India has a special relationship with Sierra Leone and the friendly ties between the two countries are based on common values and shared vision. He recalled that India was among the first countries to contribute to the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) with the deployment of 4000 strong Indian Military contingent. 

 

He also conveyed India’s appreciation to the people and government of Sierra Leone on peaceful conduct of elections in early 2018 and smooth transition of power. 

 

Declaring that India’s developmental assistance to Sierra Leone so far aggregated to US$ 217.5 million for various sectors including agriculture, energy, water resources and telecommunication, Shri Naidu announced a Line of Credit to the tune of US$ 30 million for Irrigation development in Tomabum to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production. An agreement was also signed today with the EXIM Bank of India in this regard. 

 

He said that decision was taken to reactivate the US $ 15 million Line of Credit for potable water project.  The Vice President also informed President Bio that India would be happy to offer line of credit for construction of a new President’s Office complex in Freetown. 

Highlighting the growing people-to-people linkages between the two countries, Shri Naidu said that India has extended e-Visa facility to Sierra Leone nationals for ease of mobility and both sides are also negotiating a visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic and official passports.

 

The Vice President expressed his happiness that Sierra Leone has agreed to participate in the e-VBAB project and that MoU with TCIL was signed today. 

Shri Naidu also expressed his satisfaction at the cooperation between India and Sierra Leone in the field of capacity building, especially under India’s flagship ITEC program. 

Today, a MoU was signed for Sierra Leone to participate in India’s Pan-African tele-Education, tele-Medicine initiatives, e-VidyaBharati and e-Arogya Bharati. “India will soon initiate steps to set up the Centre of Excellence in IT in Sierra Leone. India will also be dispatching 1000 MTs of rice to Sierra Leone, as a goodwill gesture, in the coming months”, the Vice President said.

An agreement was signed to initiate a cultural exchange program between the governments of India and Sierra Leone for the years 2019-23. A protocol for consultation and a MoU between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, government of Sierra Leone and the Foreign Services Institute, Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India were also signed. 

The Vice President expressed his happiness on Sierra Leone joining the International Solar Alliance in which India is playing a leading role to enable rapid deployment of solar energy globally and to facilitate the transfer of technology. 

Shri Naidu reiterated India’s offer to conduct a “Jaipur Foot” camp in Sierra Leone under the “India for Humanity” initiative for fitting of artificial prosthetic limbs for the disabled. This is an initiative undertaken in the context of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He also thanked President Bio for releasing a postage stamp on Mahatma Gandhi.

 

The President hosted a banquet in honour of the visiting Vice President today. In his speech at the banquet, the Vice President said that India and Sierra Leone are nurturing the beautiful tree of democracy and that India believed in forging stronger bonds with Sierra Leone. “India is not only opening a new mission here very soon but stands committed to work with you in all spheres of your priority”, he added. 

 

Soon after Vice President’s arrival in Freetown from Comoros, Ms. Nabeela Fareeda Tunia, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation called on Shri Naidu and held discussions on bilateral issues and international cooperation. The Vice President appreciated the Sierra Leone Government for ensuring the safety and security of Indian Community of around 1400. 

 

He said that enormous potential exists for Indian participation in mining, agro-industries, aqua-culture, diamonds and pharmaceuticals. “We need to work together”, he added.

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said that terrorism was increasingly threatening and impeding global progress and urged the world community to come together to ensure that the UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism is concluded at the earliest. 

Addressing the parliament of Comoros at Moroni, the capital of the island nation, Shri Naidu said that terrorist groups threaten peace and stability and render state institutions vulnerable. “Piracy and maritime threats as well as cross border transnational crimes, including cyber crimes, have only added new dimensions to the problem”, he added. He said that India was willing to partner with Comoros to neutralize these threats, particularly those in the maritime domain. 

Shri Naidu said that the Indian Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi had articulated a coherent Indian vision for a collaborative security architecture in the Indian Ocean which can ensure security and economic growth for all littoral countries of the region. 

Observing that India was committed to work with Comoros in accordance with the principles of South-South Cooperation, he said that the economic ties between the two countries could become stronger and there was vast potential for trade between the two nations. “India would like to become a valuable partner in the economic development of Comoros”, he added. 

Referring to the partnership between India and Comoros under the International Solar Alliance, he said it can help light thousands of homes in a sustainable manner and provide access to energy in the remotest corners. Observing that both the countries were having large youth population, the Vice President said that huge demographic dividend could be reaped “if we can train them, skill them and gainfully employ them”. 

Referring to pan-Africa e-network initiative to implement e-Vidya Bharati and e-Arogya Bharati in Comoros, he said “Under it, we are offering free tele-education to 15000 students and free tele-medicine courses to 1000 doctors and paramedics in various African countries. India is happy to share its digital revolution with Africa to enhance the well-being of its people and in particular, empower its youth”.

Touching upon the common challenges faced by various countries, Shri Naidu said that legislators from different countries can benefit significantly from sharing views and perspectives with each other. “We have to address persistent challenges of poverty, illiteracy, income inequality, gender discrimination, environmental degradation and lack of basic amenities in some parts of the world, including some areas in both our countries”, he added. 

The Vice President said that people-centric governance alone would ensure a high quality of life to all citizens and said that parliamentarians have a constitutional responsibility to play a significant role in supporting and monitoring implementation of Sustainable Development Goals. (SDGs)

Earlier the Vice President had a tête-à-tête with Mr. Abdou Ousseni, the President of the Assembly of the Union of Comoros. 

The Vice President was accompanied by a high level delegation comprising Shri Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, Minister of State for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Shri Ramvichar Netam, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) and senior officials.

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am deeply honoured to address this august House. As the first Indian Vice President to have this rare privilege, you have not only honoured me but also honoured the world’s largest democracy. My visit to COMOROS is truly historic since it is first ever bilateral visit by an Indian Vice President to your great country. 

I bring to my brothers and sisters of COMOROS the good wishes of the Parliament of India as well as of the people of India. I would like to thank H.E. President Azali Assoumani for the extra-ordinary warmth and hospitality extended to me personally and to my entire delegation. 

Dear sisters and brothers, 

Our countries share a common ocean, a common struggle against colonialism and a common endeavour to improve the quality of life of our peoples. 

The Indian Ocean has long been the centre of maritime trade and commerce and exchange of ideas. Many great civilization have flourished in the rim countries of this ocean. 

Many Indians since centuries have sailed to your perfumed islands in their dhows. Some of them decided to settle down in Comoros and today, even though small in number, form the bedrock of our cultural and trade ties. 

Our countries have successfully fought colonialism and achieved independence. It is indeed an emotional moment for me to come to Comoros today as India and the world remembers Mahatma Gandhi, the iconic Indian leader who galvanized the people of the country and garnered world wide support for the cause of Indian independence.  

Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150th Birth Anniversary is being celebrated across the globe this year, has left behind a lasting legacy of peace and non-violence for the entire humanity. 

He is also a bridge that connects our continents. 

It was Mahatma Gandhi who said on the eve of India’s independence “India’s freedom will remain incomplete so long as Africa remains in bondage”.

Sisters and brothers, 

In many ways, our own struggle against colonialism helped in reinforcing our shared principles and values and helped to redefine our existence as free nations. For example, our principled stand against apartheid in South Africa came out of our quest for equality, dignity and justice for all people, particularly in the African continent.

While India’s independence paved the way for the independence of a large number of African countries, even before we became a free nation, India has always been a strong and vocal votary of Afro-Asian solidarity. It is this solidarity and our joint search for a voice in the post colonial world which brought the leaders of India and Africa together. 

When the United Nations met in 1945 to draw up its charter, Mahatma Gandhi spoke of “the terrible deceptions and fraud” of war and added that there could be no peace for the world without “universal freedom and equality of coloured races”. The  relationship between India and Africa has been growing stronger with each passing year. 

It is, therefore, not a mere coincidence that our President, Prime Minister and myself have visited 32 African countries in the last five and half years. My Government has made a conscious effort to reach out to our African sisters and brothers, reinforcing a long standing and broad based support which we have always enjoyed in Africa. 

In the last 5 years or so, we have received nearly 100 Heads of States and Heads of Governments from Africa in India, including more than 40 Heads of States and Heads of Governments during the India-Africa Forum Summit III in 2015. We also had the privilege of having President Azali Assoumani and several other leaders from this continent in the International Solar Alliance Founding Conference in March 2018 in New Delhi. We deeply value the friendship that we have built with our African counterparts.

This close relationship is also evident in Comoros where the current leadership, warmly recognizes the role of the Indian community in Comoros and provides them with a sense of safety and security and with a welcoming environment where they could flourish. We deeply appreciate President Azali Assoumani for being not just a mentor and guide for the Indian community but also their true friend and well-wisher. 

Sisters and brothers,

Our support to Africa as well as our Lines of Credit and Buyers Credit Scheme have been driven by your requirements and your priorities. Currently nearly 181 projects in 41 African countries of USD 11 billion are being implemented with our Lines of Credit. These projects cover a wide range from large power projects, iconic buildings, IT parks, water treatment plants, rural drinking water, etc.

In this context, I am happy to note that India has provided for a Line of Credit to Comoros of USD 41.6 million for setting up of 18 MW power plant in Moroni. I would like to assure this august House that we would like to work with you more closely in the years to come. 

India and Africa draw inspiration from each other as we shape a new future for our own countries as well as for our world. 

Dear sisters and brothers, 

You are blessed to have nature’s bounty in full measure. I am happy that you are not only protecting and preserving this treasure but are willing to harness it for sustainable development. I wish to congratulate President Azali Assoumani and this august House on your decision to sign the International Solar Alliance Framework Agreement and help us take bold steps collectively towards a sustainable and cleaner world. We look forward to working with your country to take up solar projects for the benefit of your people. 

Our economic ties are strong and I am sure they can be stronger. 

Our trade with Comoros now stands at US$ 47.11 million for 2018-19. The potential for trade between India and Comoros is vast. India would like to become a valuable partner in the economic development of Comoros. 

The good news is that exports from Africa to India have increased. Our trade is becoming more broad-based. There is a huge untapped potential for our countries to grow together. 

Sisters and brothers,

However, even as political stability and peaceful transition takes place in Comoros, terrorism has, time and again, threatened to derail this process. Terrorist groups threaten peace and stability and render state institutions vulnerable. Piracy and maritime threats as well as cross border transnational crimes, including cyber crimes, have only added new dimensions to the problem. 

As a country which continues to be a victim of cross border terrorism, India is willing and ready to partner with Comoros, and supplement Comoros efforts, to neutralize these threats, particularly in the maritime domain. 

As Indian Ocean countries, our maritime security is interlinked. Prime Minister Modi has articulated a coherent Indian vision for a collaborative security architecture in the Indian Ocean, which can ensure security and economic growth for all in the littoral countries of this region. 

I am happy to convey that India will be extending a Line of Credit of US $ 20 million to Comoros on strengthening our defense and maritime cooperation.

In our contemporary world, terrorism in different forms and manifestations, is increasingly threatening and impeding global progress. The world community must come together to combat this global menace and ensure that the UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism is concluded as early as possible. 

Sisters and brothers,

Human development must grow in tandem with economic development in order to ensure inclusive and sustainable development. 

I am happy that India and Comoros are collaborating closely to enhance Comoros human resource potential through a number of capacity building programmes, including through our flagship ITEC programme, and scholarships from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations and IAFS as well as new tailor made programmes for Africa.

Given the growth of tourism all over the world, India has made it easier for Comorians to travel to India by expanding our Electronic Tourist Visa scheme to them. Our cultural ties have received a great boost through regular cultural exchanges. I am very happy to note the enthusiastic celebration of the International Yoga Day in Comoros and the readiness to appreciate Indian culture and celebrate Indian festivals. I would like to share with this august House that Festival of India will be celebrated this year and next year in Comoros which will greatly enhance cultural exchanges between our two countries.

Sisters and brothers,

India and Comoros are now marching ahead on the path of development and economic growth. We are strengthening our democratic roots and are implementing various policies and programmes to ensure that the fruits of freedom reach all our citizens.

We share a common ocean and a common future. As the Comorian saying goes “celui qui fait l'effort supplémentaire bénéficiera” – “one who makes the extra effort will benefit”. Let both our countries make that extra effort and accelerate development.

When Comoros marches ahead, India will always be there to march by your side, shoulder to shoulder.

Excellencies, to be a legislator of a country is a special responsibility. All of you represent the collective voice of the people of Comoros. You are the guardian of their welfare and the guiding lights for their growth and development. Through your work in this House, you are not only assisting day-to-day business of legislation and governance, but also in deliberating on the long-term policy orientations of your country. 

New waves of nationalism and protectionist trends are making us question the effectiveness of multilateral institutions. To legislate in such changing times demands even greater awareness and acumen from Parliamentarians. Parliamentarians have an opportunity, and constitutional responsibility, to play a significant role in supporting and monitoring implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

We have set for ourselves an ambitious, transformatory agenda. We have resolved to leave no one behind and have a special focus on the marginalized  group. We have to address persistent challenges of poverty, illiteracy, income inequality, gender discrimination, environmental degradation and lack of basic amenities in some parts of the world including some areas in both our countries. Real freedom would require us to move rapidly towards inclusive development. People centric good governance alone can ensure a high quality of life to all our citizens. 

Given these common challenges, legislators from different countries can benefit significantly from sharing views and perspectives with each other. Over the past seven decades of our independence, India has developed a robust institutional architecture of Parliamentary democracy, and we would be happy to share this experience and expertise with this august House. 

India’s General Parliamentary Elections in April- May 2019 with an electorate of 900 million was the world's largest democratic exercise.We are sharing our experiences of election management with several countries in Africa.  Several parliamentary delegations as well as officials visit our Parliamentary Research and Training Institute for Democracies (PRIDE- erstwhile BPST).  

Government of India has adopted the vision of ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’, which means ‘collective efforts, inclusive growth, with everyone’s trust’. On this basis, we are moving forward to build a strong prosperous and inclusive India. This overarching framework is not just limited to our domestic agenda, but purposefully guides our external engagement as well. 

We remain committed to work with you to meet the aspirations of your people in accordance with the principles of South-South Cooperation.

We are honored that we have been able to share our expertise and resources, in whatever manner possible, to support food energy and health security in Comoros. Our partnership under the International Solar Alliance can help us lights thousands of home in sustainable manner and provide access to energy to people in the remotest corner. 

Our countries have a large youth population. If we can train them, skill them and gainfully employ them, we can reap huge demographic dividend. Following the success of our Pan African e-Network initiative, we now look forward to the implementation of the e-vidyabharti and e-arogyabharti. Under it, we are offering free tele-education to 15000 students and free tele-medicine courses to 1000 doctors and paramedics in various African countries. India is happy to share its digital revolution with Africa to enhance the well-being of its people and in particular, empower its youth.

Let me conclude with two quotations, one from your national anthem, and another from an ancient Indian text that illuminate our collective future journey. 

First is your resolve to rise as an independent nation and love your country, your religion and the world, “Narikeni ha niya, Riveindze uwatamiya, Mahaba ya dine na duniya”.

Second is the holistic Indian vision articulated by the Indian vedic sages almost 4000 years ago, “Samaani va akuti, Samaana hrudayanivah, Samaanam astu vo mano yatha vah susahaasati”. 

(“Just as different elements in the universe co-exist harmoniously, let us all work together united by a common purpose, with a cordial, calm and composed approach.”)

                Seeking to expand bilateral relations in various fields, India and Comoros today signed 6 MoUs including one on defence cooperation. Other MoUs sought to cement cooperation in the fields of health and medicine, arts and culture and tele-education (e-Vidya Bharati) and tele-medicine (e-Arogya Bharati). MoUs on exemption of Visa for Diplomatic and Official Passport holders for short visits and protocol on foreign office consultation were also signed. 

The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu and the President of the Union of Comoros, Mr. Azali Assoumani witnessed the signing of these MoUs. 

On the second day of his tour to the African nations of Comoros and Sierra Leone, the Vice President held extensive talks with the President of the Union of Comoros, Azali Assoumani on a host of issues of common interest to both countries and sought to deepen the bilateral relations.

During the delegation level talks, Shri Naidu asserted that the recent decision in regard to the re-organization of the Jammu and Kashmir state was purely an internal matter of India and does not change any external border. The decision was made to focus on accelerating development of Jammu and Kashmir, he added.

Pointing out that Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India, he said that the decision was approved by two-thirds majority in Rajya Sabha and four-fifths in Lok Sabha. Shri Naidu said that India always believed in maintaining peaceful and friendly relations with all its neighbors, but unfortunately, one of its neighbors was aiding, abetting and funding terrorism.

In his remarks, the President of Comoros, Mr. Azali Assoumani said “on Jammu and Kashmir, we fully trust India because you are the inheritors of the wisdom of Mahatma Gandhi’.

In an extraordinary gesture of friendship, the Comorian President conferred the ‘Order of the Green Crescent’, the highest civilian honour of the Union of Comoros, on the Vice President.

Accepting the honour, the Vice President said, “thank you for the un-expected honour you have bestowed upon me. I accept it with utmost humility on behalf of the 1.3 billion Indians.  I truly believe it is an honor that you have accorded to India. I am touched by your extra-ordinary gesture as a symbol of India-Comoros friendship. A common vision unites us, a common ocean joins us-it is an ocean of friendship and a vision of growing together”.

Earlier, during the delegation level talks, the Vice President called for enhancing defence ties in maritime domain between India and the island nation of Comoros as part of a collaborative security architecture in the Indian Ocean. “As Indian Ocean countries, our maritime security is interlinked”, he added.  

Shri Naidu also thanked the President of the Union of Comoros in the fight against terrorism as well as for reforms in the UN Security Council, including its continued support to India’s candidature for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.

Shri Naidu also announced that India will be gifting medicines worth Medicines and medical equipments worth USD 1 mn, USD 1 mn for transport vehicles, USD 2 mn for procurement of high-speed  interceptor boats and 1000 MT of rice. He also announced Line-of-credit of USD 41.6 mn for setting up an 18MW power plant in Moroni and a vocational training centre.

During the delegation level talks, Shri Naidu was accompanied by a high level delegation comprising Shri Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, Minister of State for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Shri Ramvichar Netam, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) and senior officials.

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today kick-started his tour to Comoros and Sierra Leone by declaring that India accorded highest priority to deepening its engagements with African nations. 

Shri Naidu asserted that the Indian government considered Africa as a ‘focus continent’, as evidenced by 32 outgoing visits at the levels of President, Vice President and the Prime Minister during the last five years. India has also decided to open 18 new embassies in Africa. 

Shri Naidu was accorded military honours and warmly received by President of the Union of Comoros, Mr. Azali Assoumani upon his arrival in the Comorian capital.

In his first engagement in Comoros, the Vice President addresses the Indian diaspora and urged them to join in scripting new India’s growth story, along with three other D`s--Democracy, Demand and Demographic Dividend.

While lauding the Indians based in Comoros for sharing their prosperity with Comorian brothers and sisters, he asked them to make Comoros more prosperous and also contribute to India’s growth. “Help create a more prosperous, harmonious, sustainable planet”, he added. 

The Vice President said that he was happy that despite being only about 250 in number, the Indian diaspora has made significant contribution in various fields, including social and economic. 

He also lauded the Indians for keeping alive India’s cultural heritage and for enjoying a reputation of being a peace loving community

Outlining the economic development and social transformation taking place in the new India under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Shri Naidu told the diaspora that despite the global slow-down, India continues to be one of the fastest growing major economies and is poised to be a US$ 5 trillion economy by 2024-25.

Referring to measures taken by the government to boost economy, he said that the recent steep slashing of corporate tax was expected to spur investments. “Doing business in India is not only lucrative to investors but is also becoming simpler. Our policy is now that of ‘Red Carpet’ and not ‘Red Tape’. Many archaic regulations are being dismantled and seamless processes are being introduced”, he added.

The Vice President said that a host of path breaking reforms were initiated, including the transformational GST, that complies with ‘One Nation-One Tax, One Nation-One Market’ approach.

He also told the diaspora that India has become one of the most open economies of the world for Foreign Direct Investment in the wake of the reforms initiated by the government. 

He also mentioned that the Start-up India flagship initiative was nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship in the country and the the youth were driving the digital revolution and powering the start-up ecosystem.  

The Vice President also highlighted that India’s trade with African nations registered a 12% increase from the previous year. “India is now the 5th largest investor in Africa with a cumulative investment of US $54 Billion”, he added.

Shri Naidu also said that he was looking forward to a fruitful meeting with Comorian President, Mr. Azali Assoumani. India and Comoros are also expected to sign several agreements in the presence of both the dignitaries tomorrow. 

Paying tributes to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th anniversary, the Vice President recalled that Gandhi Ji drew sustenance for his fight against discrimination and colonial domination, in Africa. “It was this soil of Africa which gave the nourishment and inspiration and made Mahatma Gandhi what he was. It was Africa that transformed his vision and gave greater clarity to his life’s mission”, he added.

Shri Naidu also invited the Indian diaspora of Comoros to attend the next Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas of 2021. 

The Vice President is accompanied by a high level delegation comprising Shri Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, Minister of State for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Shri Ramvichar Netam, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) and senior officials.

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today called for eliminating social evils like casteism, fundamentalism, corruption and discrimination that impede the progress of the society and the nation.

Addressing the gathering at the Ramleela Dussehra Celebration organized by Sri Dharmic Leela Committee in New Delhi today, he urged people to develop a positive mindset and promote the values of kindness, joy, tolerance, love, compassion, peace, empathy and respect, especially among children from an early age. 

Extending his greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Dussehra, Shri Naidu said that Dussehra is believed to be the day when Lord Rama defeated the demon king Ravana and also the day Goddess Durga rid the world of the demon Mahishasura. “Irrespective of which epic one chooses to believe in, it is clear that Dussehra symbolized the victory of good over evil, of righteousness and virtue over sinfulness. It is a celebration of the universal law that truth alone triumphs in the end”, he added.

The Vice President said that Dussehra was the celebration of eternal human values and morals. “It is the celebration of the victory of dharma over adharma”, he added.

Extolling the virtues of Lord Rama’s kingdom which was believed to have been an ideal state, Shri Naidu said that Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150th birth anniversary is being celebrated this year around the world, also dreamt that India should aim for the ‘Ram Rajya’. Underscoring that ‘Ram Rajya’ envisages a society based on virtue, morality and justice as the core ideals, the Vice President said that to Gandhi Ji, Ram Rajyawas a nation thatensured equal rights to both prince and pauper.

Terming Ramayana as a heritage of the entire humanity, Shri Naidu called for dedicated efforts to preserve, propagate and deepen our understanding of this immortal epic that has deeply permeated Indian consciousness. “People across the country own Rama. They closely associate and identify with Rama katha”, he added.

The Vice President reminded one and all of the core values of Ramayana. He said that the epic of Ramayana reminds us of our duty towards the world, society and family and defines the relationship of human beings with each other and with mother earth, nature, birds and animals. He opined that Ramayana’s message gains new relevance in the current global context of formidable challenges to world peace and prosperity.

He urged one and all to draw lessons from Rama’s life and perfect the art of living together and tread the path of peace and inclusive growth.

He expressed confidence that resolute commitment to justice, good governance and welfare of the people would continue to inspire us in our journey as a nation and help us make rapid progress on all fronts.

Emphasizing that festivals reflect the composite culture and rich heritage of our country, Shri Naidu said that they spread happiness and foster unity and close relationship of human beings with nature.

Dr. Manmohan Singh, former Prime Minister, Shri Dhiraj Dhar, General Secretary, Sri Dharmic Leela Committee and others were present on the occasion.

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am delighted to be here at the Ramleela Dussehra Celebration organized by Sri Dharmic Leela Committee.

I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Dussehra, a colourful festival celebrated with great fervour and zeal all over the country.

As per Hindu beliefs, today is the day when Lord Rama defeated the demon king Ravana. It is also believed that this is the day when Goddess Durga rid the world of the demon Mahishasura. 

Whichever epic you choose to believe in, it is clear that Dussehra symbolizes the victory of good over evil, of righteousness and virtue over sinfulness. 

The festival is a reminder to each and every one of us to tread the path of righteousness with unwavering commitment. As we burn the effigies of Ravana today, let us simultaneously burn all the demonic traits that lie dormant within us. 

To me, Dussehra is the celebration of eternal human values and morals. It is the celebration of the victory of “dharma” over “adharma”. 

Rama is supposed to be the embodiment of “dharma”, or righteous behaviour. 

Lord Rama’s kingdom was in many ways an ideal kingdom. 

Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150th birth anniversary is being celebrated this year around the world, dreamt that India should aim for Ram Rajya. 

Writing in ‘Young India’ in 1929, Gandhiji had said: “Whether Ram of my imagination ever lived on this earth, the ancient ideal of the Ramayana is undoubtedly one of true democracy in which the meanest citizen could be sure of swift justice without an elaborate and costly procedure.” 

Let that resolute commitment to justice, good governance and welfare of the people continue to inspire us in our journey as a nation and help us make rapid progress on all fronts. 

My dear sisters and brothers, 

Festivals reflect the composite culture and rich heritage of our country and its traditions. They spread happiness and foster unity and close relationship of human beings with nature.

The Ramleela of India is a folk tradition which has been recognized by the UNESCO as a part of World’s Intangible Cultural Heritage. 

Since ancient times, Lord Rama’s glorious tales have spread throughout South East Asia.

Undoubtedly, Ramayana is a heritage of the entire humanity. We must make the best efforts to preserve, propagate and deepen our understanding of this immortal epic. 

Ramayana has deeply permeated Indian consciousness.  People across the country own Rama. They closely associate and identify with Rama Katha. 

And the tradition is still alive and continuing. 

Today, as we assemble here to burn the effigies of Ravana, symbolizing the destruction of evil, let us pause and think as to what are the core values of the Ramayana. 

The epic of Ramayana reminds us of our duty towards the world, society and family. Ramayana defines the relationship of human beings with each other, and with mother earth, nature, birds and animals. 

This message gains new relevance in the current global context of formidable challenges to world peace and prosperity. 

We will do well to draw lessons from Rama’s life and perfect the art of living together and tread the path of peace and inclusive growth. 

I once again extend my best wishes to each and every one you on the occasion of Dussehra celebrations. May this festival bring happiness, peace and prosperity to our nation and the world.  

 

Thank You!

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today asked media to shun the tendency to sensationalize and present facts dispassionately without mixing news and views. He said that media must remain honest and truthful and act with great restraint and responsibility.

Speaking at the centennial celebrations of ‘the Samaja’, a leading Odia Daily,in Cuttack, Odisha today, he said that a free and fair media was not just a part of a healthy democracy but was an indispensable prerequisite. “Media has been considered the fourth pillar of the democratic system-- a pillar that supports, nurtures and nourishes the democracy and helps in course corrections as and when necessary”, he added.

Stating that media must inform, educate and enlighten people, Shri Naidu said that it has a critical role to play in the formation of public opinion. He asserted that media must empower citizens and help in ushering in greater transparency and accountability in the governance system. “Media must amplify the voice of citizens and communicate their opinions to lawmakers”, he added.

Shri Naidu urged media to expose loopholes in the democratic system, thereby helping the government in making the system more accountable, responsive and citizen-friendly.”Democracy without media is akin to a vehicle without any wheels”, the Vice President added.

Describing journalism as a mission, Shri Naidu said that TRPs, circulation figures and bottom lines, though important, must not dictate media’s path. He said media must place the welfare of the common man and the progress of the nation at the centre of all its activities.

The Vice President asked media to get rid of established prejudices and give voice to the expectations of youth, women, farmers and entrepreneurs. “Media must act as the moral compass and the conscience of the society and must aggressively campaign to end all social evils. It must become the voice of the voiceless and help the helpless”, he added.

Underscoring that media had the potential to be a vehicle for change in status quo, he called for the reporting and highlighting of more positive stories and best practices to inspire positive changes. He asked media to also lend a hand in protecting, preserving and promoting India’s rich cultural heritage and languages.

Referring to the stellar role played by Indian media in making the Swachh Bharat Movement a resounding success, Shri Naidu asked media to play a constructive role in solving the burning problems of our time, from poverty to disease to climate change. 

Speaking of the rapidly proliferating social media, a by-product of which is fake news, the Vice President expressed concern that the pervasive menace of fake news threatens to destroy the credibility of media and asked media to effectively tackle and disprove fake news by taking control of the narrative. 

He expressed hope that more and more vernacular newspapers would come up in India, promoting regional languages and spearheading prosperity of rural areas. He opined that regional media could truly transform the rural landscape of India through prudent, prompt and truthful reporting.

Observing that completion of 100 years was a significant milestone in the journey of an organization, Shri Naidu said that the accomplishment was a testimony to the Samaja’s commitment to journalistic excellence, dedication to objective reporting and above all, the popularity it enjoyed among the people of Odisha.

The Vice President paid tributes to the founder of the Samaja, Utkalamani Pandit Gopabandhu Das and said that he was a great teacher, a renaissance poet, a seasoned journalist, a selfless social worker, a frontline freedom fighter and a great proponent of Gandhian ideologies and moral values .

The Vice President also released a book on Gopabandhu Das written by Dr. Subhash Chandra Mishra. He said that such books on icons would serve as an inspiration to younger generation.

 

Prof. Ganeshi Lal, Hon’ble Governor of Odisha, Shri Naveen Patnaik, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Odisha, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Hon’ble Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel, Govt. of India, Dr. Achyuta Samanta, Hon’ble Member of Parliament and others were present on the occasion. 

 

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am very happy to be here today with all of you at the centennial celebrations of ‘the Samaja’, the premier Odia Daily.

At the outset, let me extend my heartiest congratulations to the Samaja family on this momentous occasion.

Completion of 100 years is a significant milestone in the journey of an organization. It is a testimony to your commitment to journalistic excellence, your dedication to objective reporting and above all, the popularity you enjoy among the people of Odisha.

I am told that the Samaja took birth in 1919 as a weekly newspaper from Satyabadi in Puri district, with the vision of informing, educating and empowering the people of Odisha and facilitating the development of the state and the nation.

I am glad to note that the Samaja has remained the nerve centre of journalism, intellectual pursuit and social service in Odisha since its inception a century ago.

I believe that Samaja is also considered to be the gold standard for Odia language and is a true delight to the literati of the state, so much so that, the elders of Odisha encourage their children to read the Samaja to perfect Odia language.

I also applaud the Samaja for transcending its journalistic mandate and engaging in the service of the poor and the oppressed. I am happy to know that a major portion of its revenue is used for the welfare of people hit by calamities. It is indeed an example worth emulating. 

The illustrious founder of the Samaja, Utkalamani Pandit Gopabandhu Das, was a great teacher, a renaissance poet, a prolific writer, a seasoned journalist, a selfless social worker, an erudite legislator, a frontline freedom fighter and of course, a great proponent of Gandhian ideologies and moral values .

He was also a dedicated educationist. He constantly spoke of the need for all citizens to fulfill their ‘Fundamental Duties’. I am glad to note that he was also a firm believer of the ancient India ideal of ‘Vasudheyva Kutumbakam’ and dedicated his life to the service of his countrymen.

I am also delighted to have released the book on Gopabandhu Das written by Dr. Subhash Chandra Mishra today. I hope that this book will take the life story of the great icon to the younger generation and serve as an inspiration.

I appreciate the Samaja for building a towering edifice of outstanding journalism on the strong foundation of morals, values and ethics, laid by its visionary founder.

My dear sisters and brothers,

The press in India has a long and illustrious history ever since the first newspaper, ‘Bengal Gazette’ was published by James Augustus Hickey in 1780.

The press played a pivotal role in inspiring people and in voicing their aspirations when the struggle to gain independence from the British began gathering momentum. It acted as a great unifier, bringing people from different backgrounds together to fight for the noble cause of freedom.

The press remained undaunted by the ironclad restrictions imposed by the British. The same resolute spirit continues to be the hallmark of the Indian media ever since independence, barring a temporary deviation during the dark times of the Emergency.

Today, India’s vibrant media landscape is dotted with thousands of journals and newspapers, hundreds of TV channels and scores of radio stations. Of course, you also have social media, which has become one of the main drivers of information in the Digital Age.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Democracy is a government of the people, for the people and by the people. It gives equal chance to all the citizens to participate and play a significant role in the political process and guarantees certain inalienable rights and freedoms to people.

A democratic system will succeed only if there is extensive participation of its citizens in governance process.

This participation will be a meaningful one only if citizens are well informed and educated. Access to information is essential for a democratic society because it ensures that citizens make responsible, informed choices rather than act out of ignorance or misinformation.

Thus reliable sources of information form an important constituent of a democratic society.

This is where the role and importance of media lies.

Media must inform, educate and enlighten people. It has a critical role to play in the formation of public opinion. It must empower citizens and help in ushering in greater transparency and accountability in the governance system. It must amplify the voice of citizens and communicate their opinions to lawmakers

Media also plays a crucial role in ensuring good governance in a democracy. Support of media may yield results in governance activities, particularly those related to decentralization, anti-corruption, and citizen participation in the policy process.

Free and fair elections conducted through transparent processes require a media sector which gives candidates equal access, and reports the relevant issues in a timely, objective manner.

Media must also expose loopholes in the democratic system, which ultimately helps government in filling the vacuums and gaps, making the system more accountable, responsive and citizen-friendly.

A democracy without media is akin to a vehicle without any wheels.

A free and fair media is not just a part of a healthy democracy but is an indispensable prerequisite. Media has been considered the fourth pillar of the democratic system-- a pillar that supports, nurtures and nourishes the democracy and helps in course corrections as and when necessary. 

Although freedom of the press has not been overtly recognized as a fundamental right in our Constitution – a perusal of the extensive debates of the Constituent Assembly makes it abundantly clear that there was wide ranging consensus about considering media freedom as an extension of fundamental freedom of expression.

After that, several decisions of the Supreme Court gave legitimacy to this recognition. Mahatma Gandhi once said that “freedom of the press is precious privilege that no country can forego”.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Media is a national resource that the journalists use in public trust.

Mahatma Gandhi once said that it is the duty of a journalist to realize the public opinion of the country and give it a vocal expression boldly.

In view of the tremendous responsibility it holds, media must remain honest and truthful and act with great restraint, responsibility, placing the welfare of the common man and the progress of the nation at the centre of all its activities.

Mahatma Gandhi also said that the objective of journalism should only be social service.

Journalism is a mission.

TRPs, circulation figures and bottom lines, though important, must not dictate your path. Media must shun tendency to sensationalize and must take care to stick to facts dispassionately and steadfastly and must diligently desist from mixing news and views.

It must get rid of established prejudices and give voice to the expectations of youth, women, farmers and entrepreneurs. Media must act as the moral compass and the conscience of the society and must aggressively campaign to end all social evils. You must become the voice of the voiceless and help the helpless.

Media must be a vehicle for change in status quo. It must highlight positive stories and best practices so that they inspire positive changes and can be replicated elsewhere.

Media must play a constructive role in solving the burning problems of our time-- from poverty to disease to climate change. The world has already witnessed the stellar role played by Indian media in making the Swachh Bharat movement a success.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has announced on October 2nd, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi that India was Open Defecation Free and a lot of credit for this achievement goes to the media.

It must now take up more such missions in national interest, such as ‘Fit India’ and turn them into people’s movements. Media must also lend a hand in protecting, preserving and promoting India’s rich cultural heritage and languages.

We live in an era of rapidly proliferating social media, a by-product of which is fake news. The pervasive menace of fake news now threatens to destroy the credibility of media.

Under such circumstances, you must be prepared to effectively tackle and disprove fake news by taking control of the narrative. You must devise creative solutions to contain fake news. You must tackle paid news with the same zeal too.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Even though we live in an era of electronic and digital media, print media continues to be important, especially in India. Estimates say that print media revenues grew by 5.6% in 2018. The outlook for growth in the years to come is also positive. 

I hope that more and more vernacular newspapers would come up in India, promoting regional languages and spearheading the prosperity of rural areas.

Not only do regional newspapers reflect local aspirations, you are also much closer to the public. You can truly transform the rural landscape of India through your prudent, prompt and truthful reporting.

I urge you to take positive stories from the local community to a larger audience. At the community level you could give positive stories on water conservation, environmental protection, sustainable agriculture and innovation.

Your efforts will increase public confidence, community consciousness and will drive inclusive and sustainable development. I am confident that the Samaja is an asset to Odisha and it will attain even greater heights in the time to come.

Let me once again congratulate you on the occasion of your centennial celebrations.

I wish you all the very best in your future endeavors.

Thank You!

Jai Hind

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today said that poetry can serve as a powerful catalyst to hasten the process of social transformation. 

Addressing the valedictory session of the 39thWorld Congress of Poets (WCP) at Bhubaneswar in Odisha today, Shri Naidu said that poets have the capability to be influencers and opinion-makers and urged them to use their unique ability to shape people’s thoughts, feelings and attitudes to build a better world. Poets from various nations participated in the Conference.

Congratulating the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) & Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS) for organizing a confluence of talented poets, the Vice President said that he was deeply touched by the theme of the poetry conference-- “Compassion through Poetry”.

Observing that compassion was innate to all of us, he said “we must realize this and practice it consciously till it becomes our habit and all our actions, subconsciously, exhibit compassion, kindness and positivity. ‘Compassion begets compassion’, he added.

The Vice President lauded the institution, for its abiding commitment to excellence and appreciated its dynamic founder Shri Achyuta Samanta for his relentless endeavors towards reforming and transforming lives of millions of Adivasi people. 

Shri Naidu said that poetry was one of the finest expressions of human emotions and conveys the deepest insights, a wide range of emotions and elevates human experience to highest levels of consciousness. ‘Poetry has a great impact on the inner chemistry of human emotions. How we perceive, how we respond and how we behave – all this is shaped by literature and fine arts to a large extent’, he added.

The Vice President said that India’s tryst with poetry was as old as its civilization. He spoke of the great Indian epics Ramayana & Mahabharata and said that they were among the finest specimens of poetry ever written, celebrated world over for the grandeur of their themes, their extraordinary literary heights and the depth of messages they convey.

Emphasizing that it was crucial to promote arts and culture to build an enlightened and healthy society, he said “Arts nurture creativity in the society. Without a creative voice, a society will become stagnant. Artists enliven lives. They transform our lives and change our perception”, he observed.

Describing artists as the conscience keepers of a society, Shri Naidu said that they constantly question the absurd and the illogical and help instil positive values in the society. “By sharing common cultural threads, art unites hearts. It brings out latent human characteristics to the force”, he added.

Stressing that poetry was a powerful vehicle of intergenerational transmission of values and knowledge, the Vice President said that Indian tradition has relied on poetry for transmission of wisdom and even scientific knowledge.

He urged schools to make poetry reading and appreciation a compulsory part of the curriculum. He also asked universities to encourage literature, arts and humanities education.”We need poets and writers and artists and singers as much as we need doctors, engineers and scientists”, he underscored.

Suggesting that promotion of literature was also an impactful method to preserve and promote languages, the Vice President said that the best way to preserve or promote any language was to use it extensively in everyday life. He opined that more and more people should be encouraged to write poetry, stories, novels and dramas in their native languages and called for dedicated measures to preserve, protect and promote mother tongues. 

He expressed hope that events such as the World Conference of Poets would serve as platforms for sharing poetic masterpieces with the world and at the same time inspire budding poets to get inspiration from other poets.

The Vice President expressed hope that larger public good would serve as the underlying source of inspiration as poets continue to ‘weave the silken threads of poetry and enthrall as well enlighten multitudes of people across the world’.

Prof. Ganeshi Lal, Hon’ble Governor of Odish, Shri Pratap Chandra Sarangi, Hon’ble Minister of State for Animal Husbandary, Dairying & Fisheries and MSME, Govt. of India, Shri Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi, Hon’ble Minister of State (I/C), Odia Language, Literature & Culture, Tourism, Odisha,Prof. Achyuta Samanta, President, 39th World Congress of Poets and others were present on the occasion. 

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am delighted to be here today amidst such talented and passionate poets from various countries and all parts of India for the valedictory ceremony of the World Congress of Poets (WCP).

I am happy to be at the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) and Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS). With over 27,000 students from across the country and abroad, this institution is growing from strength to strength. I am happy to know that it has received several international and national awards and accolades for its abiding commitment to excellence.

The institution’s dedicated efforts to educate children from tribal communities are also truly noteworthy.

I congratulate KIIT for being awarded the 'Status of Eminence' for its dedication to the cause of quality education for all. I also take this opportunity to congratulate and appreciate the dynamic founder of KIIT, Shri Achyuta Samanta. His relentless endeavors towards reforming and transforming lives of millions of Adivasi people are truly commendable. 

I also commend him for envisioning poetry as the best medium to promote brotherhood and peace. It is this vision of his that has brought all of us here together to celebrate thoughts, words, languages, rhythm and meaning.

It is a matter of great pride for us that the Congress is happening in India this year, in the beautiful and historical state of Odisha.

I am absolutely touched by the theme of this conference “Compassion through Poetry”.

I believe compassion is innate to all of us. We just have to realize it and practice it consciously till it becomes our habit and all our actions, subconsciously, exhibit compassion, kindness and positivity. Compassion is central to poetry.

The first verse of the Adi-Kavya, Ramayana starts with the utterance of ‘ma nishada’, Sage Valmiki’s compassionate appeal to the hunter to spare the life of a bird. It is his ‘shoka’ or his despair at the loss of a precious life that became ‘shloka’ or poetry.

Compassion begets compassion.

This extremely important idea, when propagated through the powerful medium of poetry, attains the capability to change the world. 

I welcome poets who have come from all over the world to Odisha. I am sure that you will carry wonderful memories of this Congress and your experiences in India.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Poetry is one of the finest expressions of human emotions. It conveys the deepest insights, wide range of emotions and elevates human experience to highest levels of consciousness. What is however important is to recognize its impact on the inner chemistry of human emotions.  How we perceive, how we respond and how we behave – all this is shaped by literature and fine arts to a large extent.  Among the literacy forms, poetry has a specially profound influence. 

Poetry is not just expression; it is an expression that has beauty in it. Poets do not just express themselves in mere words but paint images with their words. They breathe life into words with rhyme, rhythm and melody. 

Poetry speaks of deep feelings, creates stunning images and beautiful lyricism and blends truth with beauty. 

India’s tryst with poetry is as old as the civilization itself. Poetry flourished in ancient India.

The great Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are considered to be among the finest specimens of poetry ever written.

They are celebrated not just in India but all over the world for the grandeur of their themes, the extraordinary literary heights and the depth of the messages they convey. 

These epics are considered to be treasure houses of India’s traditions and great encyclopedias of ethics, religion, politics and morals. 

India has a long illustrious poetic tradition and includes such luminaries like Kalidasa, Mira Bai, Tulsi Das, Amir Khusro, Kabir Das, Sarojini Naidu, Subrahmania Bharati, Mirza Ghalib  and  Shri Rabindranath Tagore mesmerized one and all with their poetic genius.

Let me recall what Mark Twain had said about India – “India is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend and the great grandmother of tradition. 

My dear sisters and brothers,

I believe that it is crucial to promote arts and culture in order to build an enlightened and healthy society.

Arts nurture creativity in the society. Without a creative voice, a society will become stagnant.

Biologists have argued that the development of creativity was the most important step in human evolution, and that society cannot move forward without creative people. 

Artists enliven lives. Some artists transform our lives. They change our perception, our world view. 

Artists are very often the conscience keepers of a society. They constantly question the absurd and the illogical and help instil positive values in society.

By sharing common cultural threads, art unites hearts. It brings out latent human characteristics to the force. 

Poetry is a powerful vehicle of intergenerational transmission of values and knowledge. Songs and poetry have been used to pass on traditional wisdom and lessons in morals and values from generation to generation. Indian tradition has relied on poetry for transmission of wisdom and even scientific knowledge. 

More than anything else, poetry has the capability to change attitudes, mindset and social norms.  If we aim at a more compassionate world, poetry can be one of the most powerful instruments. 

Dear sisters and brothers,

I am glad to be amidst so many poets. Each and every one of you present here has the capability to be an influencer and opinion-maker.

You have the unique potential to shape thoughts, feelings and attitudes. I am confident that you will use this tremendous power at your disposal to build a better world.

Poetry should promote peace, motivate people to cultivate universal brotherhood, social harmony and tolerance. Poetry can serve as a powerful catalyst that could hasten the process of social transformation.

I urge schools to make poetry reading and appreciation a compulsory part of the curriculum. 

I also ask universities to encourage literature, arts and humanities education. We need poets and writers and artists and singers as much as we need doctors, engineers and scientists.

Promotion of literature is also an impactful method to preserve and promote languages, a cause that is very close to my heart.

The best way to preserve or promote any language is to use it extensively in everyday life. More and more people should be encouraged to write poetry, stories, novels and dramas in their native languages.

I hope events such as the World Conference of Poets will serve as platforms for sharing your poetic masterpieces with the world. At the same time, I am confident that this event would inspire budding poets to get inspiration from other poets. 

Let me conclude with a statement made by a famous Indian poet Mammata. When he was asked as to why he wrote poetry, he said, “I write for earning name and becoming famous. I write to earn my living. But, above all this, I write because I believe I can change the ways of the world by reducing negativity and whatever is not good for humanity.”

I do hope that larger public good will serve as the underlying, unseen but undiminished source of inspiration as you continue to weave the silken threads of poetry and enthrall as well enlighten multitudes of people across the world. I wish you all the very best. 

 

Thank You!

Jai Hind!

The Vice President of India Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today stressed the need to make policing people-centric and police stations people-friendly and receptive.

Addressing a National Seminar on SMART Policing organized jointly by the Indian Police Foundation, the National Centre for Good Governance and the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D), he suggested internal reforms within the police forces including improving the ambiance in the police stations to make them complainant-friendly.  

Pointing out that police station was the first point of contact for people, he said that the common man should feel confident that the police personnel were competent to redress his grievance. At present, you would agree, a complainant enters the police station with serious misgivings whether his or her report would be registered or what kind of the treatment would the person get.

He suggested them to focus on the swift and objective approach to dealing with cases rather than bothering about the increase in crime figures. He said that every complaint must be registered and enquired.

“We have been talking for many years to make police stations people-friendly. Unfortunately, that is not happening. Unless the senior officers take the lead in changing the atmosphere in police stations, I am afraid that things might not improve,” he added.

Observing that the country was facing the problems such as terrorism, Maoism and insurgency, Shri Naidu said that ballot was more powerful than the bullet.

Stating that terrorism was the enemy of humanity, he said there should be no complacency on the safety and security of the country and called for measures to enhance the capabilities of the State Police and Central Armed Forces to deal with emerging challenges effectively.

“S (table law and order ensured by motivated and committed police would provide the necessary foundations for sustained economic progress of the country,” he added.

Referring to the daunting challenges posed by Cyber age, Vice President stressed the need to train police forces across the country to tackle cyber crimes.  At the same time, he said there was an enormous scope to tap IT potential in the fields of police governance, investigation, safety and security management as well as citizen-centric policing.

Referring to the Prime Minister’s vision of smart policing, he wanted the police to think of innovative approach to deal with VIP security and in regulating traffic during the movement of VVIPS.

Expressing concern over the sporadic instances of sexual assaults and crimes against women and minor children, Shri Naidu called for stepping up of security measures to ensure the safety of women. He wanted the police to be sensitized about the need to act firmly and ensure that the culprits were brought to book at the earliest.

The Vice President said that addressing the shortage of manpower, improving the transport and communications facilities and services, and setting up of forensic more laboratories were needed in addition to the police reforms suggested by the Supreme Court.

The President of Indian Police Foundation, Shri N. Ramachandran, Director General, Bureau of Police Research and Development Shri V.S.K Kaumudi, Chairman, Indian Police Foundation, Shri Prakash Singh, Secretary Personnel Administrative Reforms, Shri Chandramouli and others were in attendance.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asked the medical fraternity to take lead and launch an awareness campaign on the need to prevent non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension and cancer, which are assuming disturbing proportions.

He wanted both private and public hospitals as well as individual doctors to visit nearby schools, colleges and community centres in their localities regularly and educate  the youngsters on the health hazards posed by modern lifestyles and the need to undertake regular physical activity and adopt healthy dietary habits.

Inaugurating the 27th Annual Conference of the Indian Academy of Neurology - IANCON 2019, in Hyderabad today, Shri Naidu said the country was facing the twin burden of some communicable diseases and NCDs, apart from glaring absence of adequate modern medical facilities in rural areas.

The Vice President also advised the governments and policy makers to give more incentives for setting up medical institutions in rural areas. The Central Governments and the States must provide a helping hand to private sector without compromising on standards. He also wanted the Medical Council of India to address the issue of increasing seats in neurology, while ensuring that the colleges strictly adhere to regulations. 

Referring to neurological disorders, he said that India has a huge burden affecting all strata of society, both in rural and urban areas.

Expressing concern that every year at least 2 million people in India suffer from brain stroke resulting in long-term disability, including paralysis and other problems, the Vice President said there was an urgent need to educate the public to control their blood pressure, blood sugar levels and adopt a healthy lifestyle apart from providing treatment.

Stating that the rise in acquired neurological diseases (non-communicable) was a worrisome development, he opined that changing lifestyle and dietary habits were adding to the trend. “Over the last two decades, the burden of non-communicable diseases like stroke, epilepsy, headaches, and spine and brain disorders in India has increased more rapidly than communicable diseases like infections and fever. 55.2% of all deaths in India in 2016 were due to non-communicable diseases, according to a study” he added.

Shri Naidu said that the burden of the neurological disease must be tackled by adopting a multi-pronged approach including augmenting seats in neurology and establishing more and more hospitals in the rural areas equipped with CT and MRI scans for early diagnosis of neurological disorders.

He also called for providing rehabilitation services in the rural areas along with training the family members in the rehabilitation process, so that they can take care of the disabled persons.

Observing that the health sector in India was facing the problems of inadequate public spend, low doctor-patient ratio, high share of out-of-pocket expenditure, inadequate infrastructure in rural areas including lack of penetration of health insurance and inadequate preventive mechanisms, the Vice President  opined that it was crucial  to address this huge gap in the supply of trained healthcare practitioners by opening more medical colleges and increasing the number of seats at both graduate and postgraduate levels.

To mitigate this crisis, we need to pay much more attention to Primary Healthcare, which is the first point of contact with any patient with the medical system.

More than 2000 delegates, including 15 international experts from the USA, UK, Australia, Austria, Portugal, Japan, and Italy attended the conference.

The Member of NITI Aayog, Dr. Vinod Paul, the MD & CEO, KIMS Hospitals, Hyderabad, Dr. B. Bhaskar Rao, the President, Indian Academy of Neurology, Dr. Satish Khadilkar, the President, World Federation of Neurology, Dr. William Carroll, the Secretary, Indian Academy of Neurology, Dr. Gagandeep Singh, the Chairman, Organising Committee, Dr. S. Mohandas, the Organising Secretary, Dr. Sita Jayalakshmi and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am pleased to inaugurate the 27th annual meeting of the Indian Academy of Neurology—IANCON 2019 and address all of you. Although I am not an expert on the subject like most of the delegates gathered here, I had accepted the invitation to share a few of my thoughts and to get an understanding of the latest developments in your specialty.

I am told that more than 2000 delegates, including 15 international experts from USA, UK, Australia, Austria, Portugal, Japan and Italy are attending this conference. I wish you all a pleasant and fruitful stay in this beautiful and historic pearl city of Hyderabad.

I am happy to know that the Indian Academy of Neurology promotes research, education and interaction among experts, practitioners and students of neurology about various neurological disorders. Holding such annual meetings and scientific deliberations are essential to update knowledge and keep abreast of the latest advances. 

Various programmes implemented by successive governments over the past many decades have enabled steady improvement in the health indicators from improving longevity to eradicating polio and largely controlling other communicable diseases. However, the major concern today is the rapid rise of non-communicable diseases.

In fact, the country is facing the twin burden of some communicable diseases and NCDs, apart from glaring absence of adequate modern medical facilities in the rural areas, particularly in the remote parts of the country. This is an area that needs to be addressed on a war footing by all the stakeholders in the healthcare industry, including the private sector.

As regards neurological disorders are concerned, I am informed that India has a huge burden affecting all strata of society, both in rural and urban areas. This is because of a combination of age-related diseases due to increased longevity and the problems of infections attacking the brain.  

Although neurological disorders deal with all problems arising from dysfunction of brain , spinal cord, muscles and nerves,  the most common among these are Brain stroke, Dementia, Epilepsy, Head Injuries and infections of brain.

It is estimated that every year at least 2 million people in India suffer from brain stroke resulting in long-term disability, including paralysis and other problems. While the government is doing its best to provide effective treatment, the key to stroke management lies in prevention by educating public to control their blood pressure, blood sugar levels and adopt a healthy life style.   

While the estimated prevalence of serious neurological disorders like brain stroke, epilepsy, dementia is 5 to 8 per 1000 people in developed countries, the prevalence in India is nearly “double” at 14 to 17 per 1000 people.

Although diseases of brain due to community acquired infections, maternal malnutrition during pregnancy and lack of oxygen (hypoxia) during child birth are on the decline, I am told that there is rise in acquired neurological diseases (non-communicable). This is a worrisome trend and is probably due to changing lifestyle and dietary habits.

Over the last two decades, burden of non-communicable diseases like stroke, epilepsy, headaches, spine and brain disorders in India has increased more rapidly than communicable diseases like infections and fever. In fact, 55.2% of all deaths in India in 2016 were due to non-communicable diseases.

Brain strokes are one of the leading causes of death and disability in India, alongside heart diseases and lung diseases.

The five leading risk factors for increased disease burden in recent times are child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood glucose levels. Surprisingly, all of which can be controlled by a healthy and active lifestyle. 

It is of immense relevance to health administrators and planners that adequate neurology services have to be provided with requisite workforce and infrastructure both in the urban centres as well as rural population areas, including remote places in the country.

In view of the constraints of limited specialist workforce and finances, there is a need to optimize the available resources through innovative strategies, including the use of telemedicine.

I am told that dementia or loss of memory is the second biggest contributor to neurological burden in India. In view of the expected increase in the proportion of elderly population in our society in future, the number of people with dementia is expected to triple in India by 2050. This challenge needs to be addressed with well-planned strategies for prevention and treatment of dementia.

I am told that epilepsy affects 1% of Indian population.  While the public awareness campaigns by neurologists have helped to increase the awareness and reduce the stigma attached to it, the need of the hour is to make accessible the advances in the medical and surgical treatment of epilepsy to the vast majority of our population living in rural areas.

The neurological diseases burden needs to be tackled by adopting a multi-pronged approach. Apart from augmenting the seats in neurology, more and more hospitals in the rural areas need to be equipped with CT and MRI scans for early diagnosis of neurological disorders. There is also a need to provide rehabilitation services in the rural areas.

The lack of adequate rehabilitation services in rural areas  can be partly overcome by training the  family members in the rehabilitation process, so that they can take care of the disabled persons.

As mentioned earlier, India has achieved significant progress since Independence on various health indicators. With successive governments according high priority to health and the wellbeing of the people, the average life expectancy has increased to 69 years and India’s disease burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases has dropped from 61 % to 33 % between 1990 and 2016.

There are noteworthy improvements in health indicators relating to infant mortality rate (IMR) and maternal mortality rate (MMR) due to increasing penetration of healthcare services across the country, extensive health campaigns, sanitation drives, increase in the number of government and private hospitals in India.

India launched ‘Ayushman Bharat’, said to be the world’s largest health insurance scheme, under the aegis of which lakhs of people are receiving free treatment.

India’s health sector has a number of competitive advantages, from a large pool of well-trained medical professionals, to a flourishing Pharma industry which excels in generic drug manufacturing, to cost effective and quality medical procedures. The cost of surgery in India is substantially less when compared to the US or Western Europe, which makes India a healthcare destination of choice.

In spite of all these advancements, there is a long and arduous road ahead of us.

Our health sector still grapples with inadequate public spend, low doctor-patient ratio, high share of out-of-pocket expenditure, inadequate infrastructure in rural areas, lack of penetration of health insurance and inadequate preventive mechanisms.

We face a huge shortage in the number of qualified medical practitioners in India, especially specialist doctors. The National Health Profile 2018 says that there is just one allopathic government doctor available for around 11,082 people across the country, a figure more than 10 times of the WHO recommended figure of 1:1000.

It is crucial that we address this huge gap in the supply of trained healthcare practitioners by opening more medical colleges and increasing the number of seats at both graduate and postgraduate levels. Nearly 86% of all the medical visits in India are made by people living in rural areas with the majority required to travel long distances for accessing quality health care facilities. Besides, the out of pocket expenses are driving many into the vicious cycle of debts.

To mitigate this crisis, we need to pay much more attention to Primary Healthcare, which is the first point of contact of any patient with the medical system.

Before concluding, I would like to urge the medical fraternity to play a pro-active role and launch an awareness campaign on the need to prevent non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, which are assuming disturbing proportions. I would like the both private and public hospitals as well as individual doctors to visit nearby schools and colleges in their localities regularly and educate the youngsters on the health hazards posed by modern lifestyles and the need for regular physical activity and healthy dietary habits.

 

Thank you! Jaihind!

                The Vice President of India and the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for constant dialogue, exchange of ideas and interaction between Indian languages to strengthen the cultural, linguistic and emotional unity of the country.

Addressing the 8th meeting of the Hindi Salahkar Samithi of the Rajya Sabha, in Hyderabad today, the Rajya Sabha Chairman, Shri Naidu said that the best way to protect and preserve languages was to constantly use them and called for steps to promote all languages along with Hindi. He said one must accord full respect to all the mother tongues or native languages. 

Stating that knowing many languages was an advantage, especially in a country like India which was home to rich linguistic diversity, the Vice President asserted that there should not be imposition of any language, nor should there be opposition to any language.

Describing Hyderabad as the confluence of cultures and languages, Shri Naidu said that the city played an important role in the promotion, spread, and development of Hindi, Urdu along with Telugu. He also said scholars of Sri Trilok Chandra Shastri, Pandit Krishna Dutt, Pandit Vinayak Rao Vidyalankar, Shri Badri Vishal Pitti and others have made commendable contributions for the promotion and propagation of Hindi in the region.

Talking about the importance of Hindi which is spoken by a large number of people in the country, the Vice President said the main objective of Hindi Salahkar Samithi of Rajya Sabha was to promote the use of Hindi in the day-to-day administration of the Upper House.

The Vice President also suggested that a handbook or dictionary of simplified Hindi words should be published as it would be beneficial for MPs, especially from the non-Hindi speaking States. He also asked the Department of Official Language to conduct a workshop for MPs on the usage of simplified Hindi words.

Soon after assuming that charge of Rajya Sabha Chairman, Shri Naidu had suggested that the Samithi must meet twice a year and one meeting should be held in the non-Hindi speaking region. Today’s Hyderabad meeting was the first in that series.

The Vice President hoped that the meeting of the Rajbhasha Samiti held in Hyderabad would help in promoting the use of Hindi in South India and other states of the country and assist in increasing the dialogue between languages and enrich their vocabulary and literature.

Referring to the inspiration of Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi in the promotion of Hindi, the Vice President said that Gandhiji established the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha in Madras in 1918. With his inspiration, Hindi Prachar Sabha was also established in Hyderabad in 1935.

The Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Shri Harivansh, the Members of Parliament, Shri K Keshava Rao, Shri Satyanarayana Jatiya, Prof. Manoj Jha, Shri Ravi Prakash Verma, Shri Husain Dalwai, the Secretary-General, Rajya Sabha, Shri Desh Deepak Verma and the other members of Hindi Salahkar Samithi were present on the occasion.

Earlier the Vice President hosted a breakfast for the samithi members. Others who attended the breakfast include Minister of State for Home affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy and Rajya Sabha Members, Shri Y.S. Chowdary and Shri Santosh Kumar.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for the translation of great literary works from different languages into as many languages as possible, Indian as well as foreign. He said that in a country such as ours, translations would also play an important role in promoting national integration.

Addressing the gathering after releasing the English translation of epic Telugu novel Veyipadagalu written by ""Kavi Saamraat"" Viswanadha Satyanarayana, in Hyderabad today, he said such steps would enable the readers across the globe to not only enjoy good creative literature but also expose them to different cultures and ways of life.

The Vice President said that there was an urgent need to digitize and preserve works in different literary forms in Indian languages and promote their translations. He opined that translation of such works would enable the readers to know about the traditions, culture, customs, values, and ideas of the author and his immediate world.

The Vice President also wanted universities and colleges to set up separate departments to promote translations. He also urged all States to make mother tongue mandatory up to primary education.

Talking about the genius of Viswanadha Satyanarayana, Shri Naidu said that the legendary writer had articulated issues such as Education, Family, Society, Economy, Politics, Culture, poverty and all other pressing problems in his writings with remarkable foresight.

The Vice President said that the writer saw a crucial difference between Reading and Education and said that education must empower individuals and instill good conduct, discipline, and calibre in students.

 

Saying that good books such as Veyipadagalu transpose the reader into a new world and enrich his or her understanding of the many facets of life as narrated by the author, Shri Naidu said that the great works have the power to leave an everlasting impression on the minds of the readers.

The critically acclaimed novel was earlier translated into Hindi by former Prime Minister of India, Shri P.V. Narsaimha Rao as “Sahasra Phan”.

The Vice President also presented Viswanadha Sahitya Award to Dr. C. Mrunalini for Literary Criticism and Velchala Keshava Rao Award to Dr. Vaidehi Sashidhar for Bilingual Poetry.

The Chairman, Viswanadha Sahitya Peetam, Dr. Velchala Kondal Rao, the Chairman, Shanta Biotechnics Pvt. Ltd., Dr. K.I. Varaprasada Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has greeted the people of our country on the eve of Gandhi Jayanti. In a message, he said that Gandhiji’s principles of liberty, dignity and equality are not limited by space and time and they have universal applicability and timeless value. On this Gandhi Jayanti let us collectively pledge to honor the Mahatma by working together to realize his vision for an India that is inclusive, harmonious clean and prosperous, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's message:

""I convey my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the occasion of the 150th Birth Anniversary of the Father of the Nation – Mahatma Gandhi.

Gandhiji’s principles of liberty, dignity and equality are not limited by space and time. They have universal applicability and timeless value.

The disarming simplicity of his personal life, his message of tolerance and accommodation, the courage and audacity with which he challenged injustice, his unflinching adherence to the principles of truth and non-violence and his unwavering commitment to the cause of freedom for the nation and its people made him one of the tallest leaders to have ever walked this earth.

India continuously draws inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi’s vision: One of the most successful programmes that has been launched is the Swachh Bharat Programme or the Clean India Programme which sought to realize one of Gandhiji’s precious dreams.  As India crosses a major milestone of achieving an open defecation free society, there are many more challenges to be addressed. 

Gandhi ji envisioned a self-reliant India, a nation free from poverty, discrimination and social evils, a country that occupies a place of pride and dignity in the world.

On this Gandhi Jayanti let us collectively pledge to honor the Mahatma by working together to realize his vision for an India that is inclusive, harmonious clean and prosperous.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the recent session of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) presented a clear choice between peaceful coexistence and pursuit of conflicts bordering on perversion. He added that it brought out in focus two diametrically opposite visions, statesmanship soaring high in the statement of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi and its opposite of brinkmanship stooping too low.

Addressing a gathering after presenting the 20th Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award for Excellence: 2019 to the Plant Scientist, Dr. Manju Sharma, in New Delhi today, Shri Naidu appreciated the way India effectively unveiled its vision for lasting peace and development for humanity at the ongoing 74th UNGA Session, in stark contrast to the mindset that believes in violence, terrorism and warmongering for short-sighted vested interests.

The Vice President said that humanity had to choose the model of Statesmanship showcased by India, to march on the path of peaceful development, rather than the brinkmanship-model that has no concern for the larger good of humanity. He complimented the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for taking a firm and dignified stand against these highly condemnable acts of the neighbour.

Shri Naidu said that PM, Shri Modi championed the cause of peace and prosperity for the larger good by giving a crisp-account of the unfolding development narrative of India that was aimed at achieving Sustainable Development Goals, a cause dear to the UN and the comity of nations committed to the welfare and future of humanity across the globe.

Asserting that terrorism was the enemy of mankind and that those who aid and abet terror and violence must be isolated, he said that India continued to firmly adhere to its values of peace, in spite of grave provocation from the neighbour who unabashedly aids and abets terrorism.

Pointing out that India, since time immemorial has always embraced the values of peace, tolerance, brotherhood and harmony, the Vice President said that India has handled the recent escalation of tensions with remarkable restraint, grace, and poise.

The Vice President said that tallest leaders of the nation like Shastri Ji firmly believed that peace was the first step to prosperity. He said that their belief, which has deep roots Indian philosophy, helped them handle and defuse extraordinarily volatile situations with ease and poise.

Paying his tributes to Lal Bahadur Shastri, Shri Naidu said that Shastri Ji was known as a man of great integrity and competence and was highly regarded for his good habits of punctuality, hospitality and practicality. ‘He was humble, tolerant with great inner strength who understood the language of common man. He was renowned for his resoluteness of spirit and firmness of action’, he added.

Observing that Shastri Ji was a great communicator and negotiator-par-excellence, the Vice President said that he was entrusted with the most difficult and delicate of negotiations. He added that the values and morals that Shastri Ji taught and lived by would transcend time and generations to come. 

Referring to Shastri Ji’s address to the nation during the India-Pak war in 1965, the Vice President said that he proposed peaceful coexistence to bring an end to conflicts.

Asserting that a subcontinent at peace would benefit all and that constant strife, hostility, conflict and terror drags us all down, Shri Naidu said that Shastri Ji’s words serve as a guiding light in our efforts to bring peace and prosperity to the sub-continent.

The Vice President asked the youngsters to learn about the exemplary life of Lal Bahadur Shastri and draw inspiration from it to serve the nation with zeal and passion.

Shri Naidu congratulated Dr. Manju Sharma, a distinguished Plant Scientist for receiving the honour and said that such recognition would inspire many more talented women to pursue scientific research and encourage many to pursue a career in science, technology, innovation and research in India.

The Vice President said that during her long and exemplary career in science, Dr. Sharma has left her mark as a talented researcher, dedicated Science promoter and resourceful manager in all the organizations that she has worked with. “She has made invaluable contributions towards nation-building, through her dedication, hard work, vision and commitment to Science and Technology and its application for human welfare”, he added.

Shri Naidu applauded Dr. Sharma for establishing a number of new research institutions in the nation during her tenure as Secretary of the Department of Biotechnology and for being instrumental in strengthening and expanding infrastructure in the country for bioinformatics, human resource development and frontline research that accelerated the development of biotechnology in India in a big way.

Speaking of the need for government and universities to promote basic research, Shri Naidu said that our nation’s ability to handle today’s pressing issues, from providing energy security to curing illnesses to living sustainably in a world with finite resources, will require  innovations that arise from basic scientific research.

The Chairman, Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management, Shri Anil Shastri, the Director, Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management, Dr. D.K. Srivastava and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I welcome all of you to the Upa Rashtrapati Bhawan.

At the outset, I would like to extend my heartiest congratulations to Dr. Manju Sharma, recipient of the ‘20th Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award for Excellence, 2019’.

I must say that everyone associated with Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management (LBSIM) is fortunate, as they are part of an extraordinary legacy admired throughout the world – men and women who imbibed ‘Shastrian’ leadership and integrity and can make a difference to organizations and communities every day.

‘The Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award for Excellence’, instituted by LBSIM, certainly upholds Shastri Ji’s vision. I am glad that it values and honors people who have brought about profound transformation in the environment they exist in.

I am happy that this year the award has been presented to Dr. Manju Sharma, a distinguished and highly accomplished Plant Scientist.

During her long and exemplary career in science, Dr. Sharma has left her mark as a talented researcher, dedicated Science promoter and resourceful manager in all the organizations that she has worked with.

It is truly heartening to note that she has served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences, bagging the unique distinction of being the only woman to have served as President of any of the science academies of India.

I am glad to note that, as a Secretary of the Department of Biotechnology, she established a number of new research institutions in the country.

I am told that she has also been instrumental in strengthening and expanding infrastructure in the country for bioinformatics, human resource development and frontline research that accelerated the development of biotechnology in India in a big way.

It is heartening to note that she has received tremendous love and affection from the scientific community. She has made invaluable contributions towards nation-building, through her dedication, hard work, vision and commitment to Science and Technology and its application for human welfare.

I congratulate her for winning this coveted award today.

My dear sisters and brothers,

It is appropriate that such an important award has been named after Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji, one of the tallest leaders of the nation.

Tomorrow, we celebrate the 115th birth anniversary of Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji. I join the country in paying tributes to this great son of India.

The values and morals that he taught and lived by, have transcended time and generations and are valuable for all times.

I urge youngsters to learn about his exemplary life and draw inspiration from it to serve the nation with zeal and passion.

Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji was known as a man of great integrity and competence. He was humble, tolerant with great inner strength who understood the language of common man. He was renowned for his resoluteness of spirit and firmness of action.

Shastri Ji rose from humble beginnings to occupy the top-most position in the nation. He maintained humility and commitment for the welfare of humanity to the very end and served the nation with unwavering commitment.

He was highly regarded for his good habits of punctuality, hospitality and practicality.

Shastri Ji was also a great communicator and negotiator-par-excellence. Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India entrusted him with the most difficult and delicate of negotiations.

One of the secrets of his extraordinary success as negotiator was his ability to see the other man’s point of view.

He was deeply empathetic and was always ready to make maximum allowance for the other person’s point of view and feelings.

During his tenure as Minister without portfolio and as Home Minister, he handled and defused extraordinarily volatile situations with ease and poise.

Lal Bahadur Shastri firmly believed that peace was the first step to prosperity.

His address to the nation during the India-Pak war in 1965 is especially pertinent to us today. He said, ""While the conflict between the armed forces of the two countries has come to an end, the more important thing for the United Nations and all those who stand for peace is to bring to an end the deeper conflict... How can this be brought about? In our view, the only answer lies in peaceful coexistence. India has stood for the principle of coexistence and championed it all over the world. Peaceful coexistence is possible among nations no matter how deep the differences between them, how far apart they are in their political and economic systems, no matter how intense the issues that divide them.”

Today, decades later, as we strive to bring peace and prosperity to the sub-continent, Shastri Ji’s words serve as a guiding light. It tells us that a subcontinent at peace benefits all and that constant strife, hostility, conflict and terror drags us all down.

Since time immemorial, India has always embraced the values of peace, tolerance, brotherhood and harmony. We have continued to firmly adhere to these values. In spite of grave provocation from our neighbor who unabashedly aids and abets terrorism, India has handled the escalation of tensions with remarkable restraint, grace and poise. Terrorism is the enemy of mankind.

I must compliment our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for taking a firm yet dignified stand against these highly condemnable acts of our neighbor.

 

I am also glad that India effectively unveiled its vision for peace and development for humanity at the ongoing 74th UNGA Session in contrast to the mindset that believes in violence, terrorism and warmongering for short-sighted vested interests.

I also compliment PM Modi for championing the cause of peace and prosperity for larger good by giving a crisp account of the unfolding development narrative of India that is aimed at achieving Sustainable Development Goals, a cause dear to the UN and the comity of nations committed to the welfare and future of humanity across the globe.

This session of UN presented a clear choice between peaceful coexistence and pursuit of conflicts bordering on perversion.

It brought out in focus diametrically opposite visions powered by statesmanship soaring high in the statement of PM Modi and its opposite of brinkmanship stooping too low.

Statesmanship flows from sacred hearts and noble thoughts that worry for the good of mankind. Its opposite of brinkmanship is a manifestation of narrow and perverse minds propelled by defining lack of concern for larger good of humanity.

Choice is clear.

Let humanity march on the path of peaceful development highlighted by Indian model.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Shastri Ji’s priority was always the common man, the weakest element in the society - his food, his clothing and his shelter, education for his children and good medical facilities.

What Shastri Ji said in his first broadcast to the nation as Prime Minister on 11 June 1964 is also equally relevant today and I quote: ""There comes a time in the life of every nation when it stands at the cross-roads of history and must choose which way to go. But for us there need be no difficulty or hesitation, no looking to right or left. Our way is straight and clear – the building up of a socialist democracy at home with freedom and prosperity for all, and the maintenance of world peace and friendship with all nations.”

This was a crystal clear and resolute articulation of India’s national objectives, both for achieving domestic goals and for formulating an effective foreign policy.

This concern for the common man is what dominated his career as a leader and statesman.

The institutions that are named after him and are inheritors of his legacy must focus upon this concern for common man and work his well being.

My dear sisters and brothers,

I am especially happy that this award has been presented to a Scientist here today.

Shastri Ji gave the clarion call of ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ and Atal ji added ‘Jai Vigyan’ to it, indicating the importance India gave to science and technology. Our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has further fortified the slogan, adding ‘Jai Anusandhan’ to it, signaling India’s resolve to strengthen its research architecture.

The presentation of this award for excellence to a scientist and researcher signifies India’s desire and determination to excel as a science and technology leader in the world.

I have always stressed that the future of India would be determined by how successful we are in harnessing the power of science and technology.

Science is the engine of prosperity and can fuel the nation’s economic growth.It is common knowledge that research in basic sciences forms the bedrock of all technological advancement. Basic-science research deserves steady commitment and investment.

Our nation’s ability to handle today’s pressing issues, from providing energy security to curing illnesses to living sustainably in a world with finite resources, will require  innovations that arise from basic scientific research.

It is crucial for the government, universities, corporate houses and others to come together and ensure that an innovation-based scientific eco-system thrives in the country with special emphasis on sustainability.

We need to invest more on cutting-edge science research.

Innovation, incubation and start-ups are the buzz words in today’s world and countries and societies which are knowledge-centric and technology-driven will play a greater role in the global economy.

For us in India, this is the time to seize the opportunity and promote the culture of innovation and technology-based entrepreneurship.

India has a tremendous demographic dividend that is waiting to be realized. In an ageing world, India has one of the youngest populations. By 2020, the median age in India will be just 28, compared to 37 in China and the US, 45 in Western Europe, and 49 in Japan.

With about 65 per cent of the population below the age of 35 years, we need to convert this huge human capital into a force multiplier for the Indian economy by scientifically and technologically empowering the youth.

A strong STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education pipeline is therefore extremely critical. We must not only encourage more youngsters to enter the world of science, we must also encourage more women to take up science as a career.

Equally important is to recognize the work of scientists and technocrats who are doing outstanding service to the nation so that their discoveries are taken to the public at large, inspiring more youngsters to take up science as a career.

Stalwarts like Dr. Sharma are role-models to women all over the country. I am sure that she will inspire many more talented women to pursue scientific research.

I am confident that initiatives such as this award will go a long way in promoting science, technology, innovation and research in India.

I once again congratulate Dr. Manju Sharma and wish her all the very best in her future endeavours.

Thank You! Jai Hind!”

                Friends, 

This evening's experience is amazing, in the vicinity of the Statue of Unity near Sardar Sarovar Dam in Kevadia. It will be remembered for life and just now we heard the voice of Sardar Saheb and his message. It touches the inner self directly. 

Friends, 

This combined foundation course of various civil services of the country has in a way started a new chapter. Till now it has been known that some people are trained in Mussoorie, some in Hyderabad or in other cities. As I told you before; the form of silos which I often talk about used to start from the training itself. The integration of civil services in true sense is beginning now with you all. This in itself is a reform. I congratulate all the officials associated with this and all my friends.

Friends, 

This reform is not just limited to the integration of training, but its thinking and approach have also been widened. Efforts have been made to ensure that all the young trainees like you have an extensive exposure. This is the reason why you were introduced to the global leaders and experts connected to the social and economic world.

Friends, 

Beneath the Statue of Unity, this programme becomes even more special, even more significant because Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel himself had the vision to make all the Civil Services an important medium of nation building and national unity. To achieve this vision, he faced many challenges. At that time, some people felt that the officers who played a role in suppressing the freedom movement, how they would be helpful in building independent India. And this question was very natural. This question was natural and the feeling of hatred was also very natural; but the far-sighted Sardar Saheb reminded these critics that after all it is on the basis of the bureaucracy we have to move forward. It is this bureaucracy which acted as a vital link in the expenditure of princely states.

Friends, 

Sardar Patel has shown that it is always necessary to have a strong will power for meaningful change in the life of ordinary people. Nearly a hundred years ago, by changing the Ahmedabad municipality with the limited resources within ten years, he had convinced every one of his talent. And with this vision, he had drawn the roadmap of civil services of independent India.

Friends, 

Every effort made with impartial and selfless spirit is the strong foundation of the New India. To fulfil the dream of a New India, 21st century thinking and dreams are indispensable in our bureaucracy - a bureaucracy that is creative and constructive, imaginative and innovative, proactive and polite, professional and progressive, energetic and enabling, efficient and effective, transparent and tech-enabled.

Friends, 

There is a huge opportunity before you and the responsibility is also equally huge. There was a time when your seniors had to handle everything in the absence of basic facilities, be it roads, railways, ports, airports, schools, colleges and even telephones; everything was lacking. Today the situation is not the same. India is changing rapidly. The journey that had once started with fewer resources is now moving towards abundance. Today there is immense youth power in the country. Today the country has abundant food grains. Today the country has the power of modern technology - now you have to take full advantage of this abundance. You have to increase the country's viability, as well as strengthen its stability.

Friends, 

You have not chosen this path only for a job or career, but have come to serve. You have come with a sentiment to serve. You have come here with the mantra of ‘Seva Paramodharma’. Lakhs of lives will be affected by your every decision, every action and every signature. And friends, whatever decision you take, its scope will undoubtedly be local and regional, but its prospective should be national. That is, you will take the decision according to the needs and problems of your district, your block and your department. You can and should always check how they can contribute to the development of the country.

And friends, you will definitely judge your decision on the two criteria. One - as Mahatma Gandhi had shown the way - whether your decision is able to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the person at the bottom-most stratum of the society or not; And second - your decision should be such that it helps to advance and strengthen the unity, integrity and progress of the country.

Friends, 

The discussion on Aspirational districts was held here. After all, why did more than 100 districts of the country miss the race for development? Mindset and approach have also been a major reason behind this. These districts were geographically and socially very challenging. So they were ignored at every stage. These districts were left to their fate. This neglect led to a feeling of dissatisfaction in the society and unscrupulous forces were taking advantage of this. As a result, the development of these districts became even more difficult. It was necessary to change this situation. So we decided to highlight the aspirations of these districts instead of backwardness. We started working on every parameter of the Human Development Index within a time frame. We launched the schemes in a more effective way by increasing the use of technology. Today we are also getting unprecedented results. And now all of you have the responsibility to expedite this work.

Friends, 

In the future, many of you will be posted at the block or district level. Obviously, you will have to find solutions to many problems there. I would suggest that you take up one major problem at a time in your area and try to solve it completely i.e. one district, one problem and total solution. Often, we start enthusiastically trying our hand at everything simultaneously, dividing both our efforts and our resources. Solve one problem at a time, which will also give you confidence and the people's trust in you will also increase. Now if you win the trust of the public, then public participation with you also increases.

Friends, 

You have a big challenge before you to change the negative thought about bureaucracy and system. Bureaucracy and system have become two such words that do not need the adjective 'bad' to mean bad bureaucracy or bad system. It is already being used in a negative connotation. Why did this happen? Most of our officers are hardworking and receptive, but a negative perception has been formed over the entire system and the entire bureaucracy.

Friends, 

The image that has been created about civil services is of power, aristocracy and influence. This image is definitely of the colonial legacy, which some people could not relinquish completely. You have to try to pull the Civil Services out of this image. You should be identified with soft power, not hard power. Hard power causes resentment and soft power becomes a great medium to develop harmony. There should be a simple mechanism from appointment to hearing. The public should never feel that you live behind seven doors. It is not possible that you have an instant solution to every problem and the general public also understands this very well. They just want to be heard and want respect. Citizens just want their voices to reach the right platform. Sometimes the citizens of our country get satisfied just by that. Your effort should be to leave your office with a sense of respect and satisfaction.

Friends, 

For any public servant, honest feedback is very important for effective implementation of the policy and effective service delivery. You must develop this mechanism too. Earlier, there was a rule for the collectors for night halts. There also used to be a march to halts ratio. This entire exercise showed how much time the officer spent in the field. Now this tradition, in a way, has brought a lot of slackness in it; somewhere it seems to have ended. One such old tradition was that of the district gazetteer, which now seems almost extinct. There was also a system of handing over note, in which every officer leaving the office would leave a note for the new officer. Through this note, the new officer had great facility to understand the challenges, problems and important issues related to that post or to that office. There used to be a continuity of governance. Many such best practices have been in our old systems, which need to be revived. We have to enrich and further strengthen the old good traditions with the new technology in today's era. We should use technology as a multiplier, not as an alternative. Such as feedback mechanism; along with the old methods of interaction we can make better use of social media. Social media may not and should not be considered a reliable source, but it is definitely a tool that we can use. And yes, the input that we get about our decisions, our policies, and the feedback that we get, is equally important. It must not be the case that we listen to and see only that which suits our ears and eyes. We should read and listen to the opinions of our opponents, while expanding our scope of getting feedback. This will give depth to our vision only.

Friends, 

Sometimes we make another mistake while staying in the government system. Often sitting in AC rooms we feel that everything is alright. We have a limited social circle, which includes people just like us. This is the reason why very often we do not get the right information about common problems. Therefore, in any service, we need to get out of our comfort zone and connect with the people. This will help us in taking the right policy decision.

Friends, 

We also have to understand that be it the ministries or municipal corporations or other government departments, we are a service provider. The consumer should be the topmost priority of the service provider. When we understand this, then changes will be brought at every level from supply chain management, to the inventory of man power and technology. Life will automatically become easy when there are necessary changes in service delivery.

Friends, 

I have just used the prevailing language of management with you and that is because sometimes it is very easy to go from known to unknown to explain something. It is also an easy way. Beyond all this remain our inner feeling, our inner desires and inner senses. A thought should be associated with your existence with every breath. What is that idea?

Friends, 

It should be ingrained in your mind that whatever you are today is because of your country, society and crores of people of this country. This country belongs to me; the people of this country belong to me. The frills and paraphernalia that I have received after coming in this service are laced with the smell of sweat of poor people.

Friends, 

We are indebted to the poor of the country and to the people of the country. We have only one way of repaying the debt of the poor and the common man of the country - we should make the life of the countrymen easier and by earnestly trying to work hard for their rights and what they deserve.

Friends, 

Today's New India is more aspirational than ever. It is impatient and its urge for development is more than ever. Today, all over India, we can see that the citizen is more aware, alert, more involved and more sensitive than ever before. If the government makes an appeal and asks for any help or requests to join any campaign, then all the countrymen happily join it. In such a situation, we also have a responsibility to increase the ease of living of the countrymen. We have to work proactively for the same. We have to ensure that the common man does not have to deal with the government in everyday life. We have to take care that the lives of the ordinary citizens do not get subdued under the influence of the government and the life of the poor should not end in the absence of the government.

Friends, 

One more thing plays an important role in ensuring ease of living. This is the idea behind strengthening our economy, our Per Capita Income and the goal of creating a five trillion dollar economy. All of you have a great responsibility in achieving this goal. Wherever you will be stationed, efforts should be made by all the organs of the Civil Services to make all the arrangements business friendly in order to create a better ecosystem there.

Friends, 

The need of the hour is to ensure that all the districts of the country compete with one another for their economic progress. The more a district grows, the better will its state perform and it will have a direct impact on the GDP of the entire country. And so in the future, whichever district you are posted at, you must make every effort to speed up economic activities.  For example, if we take export - does the district have a proper system of export? Are the products of that district sold in countries around the world? Do you have any plans to increase the export? You should set the target associated with increasing exports, manufacturing and agriculture; and use sustained efforts to achieve the goals associated with them. I hope that with your concerted efforts, we will be able to achieve every goal.

Friends, 

It is equally important that for major goals our decisions are clear and timely. But many times we see that there are some friends who try to avoid decision making. This may or may not result in profit or loss at the individual level, but the country suffers a lot. The nation and we all have a lot of expectations for solutions from all of you. We don't expect a status quo from you.

Friends, 

Every necessary administrative reform is being done so that you can work with complete freedom and responsibility. We are also trying to ensure that 'transfer Raj' ends and the bureaucracy get a stable tenure; capability is considered instead of lobbying for posting. You have become a witness to our efforts of overhauling the existing training system. We are moving towards an integrated mechanism which will be based on continuous customized delivery.

Friends, 

You have a long tenure. I got an opportunity to spend almost the entire day with you all. In a way, it is just the beginning of our meeting. We will continue to meet even in the future. During training, you should learn new things and apply new learning in the service of the country. Never let the student inside you die. We may achieve any heights in life, but the inner student teaches us many things and continues to inspire us to learn more.

Friends, 

It is our collective responsibility to fulfill the dreams of Sardar Patel. It has to be fulfilled and with this expectation, I conclude by offering my best wishes to you all. And like I said this morning, the service you are associated with is a part of Sardar Saheb's dream. And so the strong foundation stone laid by Sardar Saheb, has been developing gradually over the last 70 years. Now the times have changed, the century has changed, the dreams have changed, intentions have changed, expectations have changed, needs have changed and in such a scenario, we cannot create a New India of the 21st century with a mindset of the previous century. Thus, our thinking should also be of the 21st century. Our dreams should also be of the 21st century, and with the blessings of Sardar Saheb, we have to make ourselves capable and we have to dedicate ourselves for fulfilling this dream. We have to bring the change through our efforts. Every Indian has a dream to create a New India, but we have a greater responsibility.  Make yourself eligible for that responsibility.

This statue of Sardar Saheb is known as the highest statue in the world, but for us it is not only the highest statue, but is a statue that will inspire everyone for centuries to come. We will depart from here by seeking inspiration from this statue for centuries to come, bowing our heads, pledging to follow his ideals, taking the blessings of mother Narmada for further strengthening this resolve. With this one expectation, I offer my best wishes to you.

Thank you all so very much.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a gathering of over 430 Civil Service Probationers, Officers and others at the Statue of Unity, Kewadiya, on the occasion of the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas today.

The Probationers in a separate interaction with the Prime Minister earlier made presentations on various thematic areas viz. Agriculture and Rural Empowerment, Health care reforms and policymaking; sustainable rural management techniques, inclusive urbanization and future of education

In his address the Prime Minister said, “This kind of combined foundation course of various civil services in country is in a way the beginning of a new chapter in civil services in India. Till now you had your training at different centres like Mussoorie, Hyderabad and other places. And like I said before you were being cast into various silos – the way in which bureaucracy works – at the initial stage of your training itself. “

Appreciating the effort, he said. “The actual integration of Civil Services is happening in a proper way now with all of you.This Aarambh is a reform in itself. This reform is not limited to the integration of training alone. This is also to expand the outlook and approach and also to have a wider exposure. This is the integration of civil services. ThisAarambh is happening with you.”

And as a part of it the officer trainees were made to interact with the Social and Economic Global leaders and experts, he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that it was the vision of SardarVallabhbhai Patel to make Civil Services an important tool in the nation building.

“To make all civil services an important medium in the Nation Building and progress was the vision of SardarVallabhbhai Patel. To realise this vision, Sardar Patel had to face many a challenge.

It was the common feeling then that how can those officers who played a major role in suppressing the freedom movement, can now be utilised for the development of the nation. But Sardar Patel with his vision believed in the system that it had the potential to take the country ahead.”

“The same bureaucracy helped integrate princely states into the country”

Prime Minister shared with the probationers as to how Sardar Patel demonstrated many a time that to bring about a change in the common man’s life there is a necessity of a strong will & determination.

“About 100 years ago he put the reforms of Ahmedabad’s municipality in placewithin10 years with limited resources and proved his capability. “, he said referring to Sardar Patel’s abilities.

Prime Minister said, “And with this vision Sardar Patel drew the contours of the Civil Services in Independent India.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi exhorted the probationers to make every effort with impartiality and in true spirit of selflessness.

 “Every effort that is made with impartiality and selflessness is a strong foundation for New India.”

“In order to fulfil the vision and dreams of New India, our bureaucracy should have the thinking and approach of the 21st century. We need a bureaucracy that is Creative & Constructive, imaginative &innovative, Proactive and polite, Professional and progressive, Energetic and enabling, Efficient and effective, Transparent and Tech enabled” Prime Minister said.

He said most of the senior bureaucrats could achieve a lot even there was scarcity of resources like roads, vehicles, telephones, railways, hospitals, schools, colleges etc.

“Today it is not the same. India is making towards enormous progress. We have enormous youth power, enormous modern technology, and no dearth food resources. You now have major opportunities and responsibilities, You  have to increase the capacity of India and its stability should be strengthened.”

Prime Minster said that the probationers should dedicate themselves to the service of the nation.

“You have not come on to this path for a career or merely for a job. You have come here for service. With a mantra of SevaParamodharam”

“Your every action, one signature will effect lakhs of lives.Your decisions would be local and regional but their perspective should be national. You should always think as to how your decision would affect nation.”

“Your decision should always be based on two basic principles. One is of Mahatma Gandhi where he said whether your decision would be of any value to the last man in the lowest rung of the society and second on whether our decision would contribute to the country’s unity, stability and its strength.”

Prime Minister described the condition of more than 100 aspirational district which have been neglected on all fronts how they were lead into disillusionment.

“More than 100 districts have lost the race in development and are now aspirational districts. They have been neglected at all stages and this lead to disillusionment in the country. Now their development had become more difficult. Now we are trying to work on every aspect of HDI. We are trying to implement all policies with the help of technology. Now you have to work hard on this.We should develop these aspirational districts. “

He asked the probationers to work on one problem at a time and find a total solution to it which will increase in turn the confidence of the people and their participation.

“In our enthusiasm and anxiety we try to work on many fronts and hence dilute our resources. Instead you work on one issue. Find solution to it. One district One Problem and Total solution. Reduce one problem. Your confidence will improve and people’s confidence will also increase. It will increase their participation in programmes.”

He requested the young probationers to work with clean intent and be accessible to the public

“You should display soft power instead of hard power. You should be easily accessible to the public.You should work with clean intent. You might not have solution to all problems but you should atleast be willing to listen. Common man in this country is many a time satisfied if his problem is properly heard. He wants respect and dignity and a proper platform to convey his issues. “

He asked them to develop proper feedback mechanisms so that they can make right decisions. “In any system, in any bureaucracy inorder to be effective you should have a proper feedback mechanism. You should be able to get the feedback from your opponents too and this would increase the depth of your perspective and will help you make reforms. “ he said

Prime Minister exhorted the civil service probationers to work with technological solutions and help country achieve the 5 trillion dollar economy.

The Probationers in a separate interaction with the Prime Minister earlier made presentations on various thematic areas viz. Agriculture and Rural Empowerment, Health care reforms and policymaking; sustainable rural management techniques, inclusive urbanization and future of education.

Sardar Patel - Amar Rahe, Amar Rahe.

Sardar Patel - Amar Rahe, Amar Rahe.

 

Friends, we have just heard the ideas of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. His voice resonated in our ears. The current importance of his thoughts, the unity of the country and the idea for integrity were what we experienced today through his words, in his voice. The power in his speech and the inspiration in his thoughts can be felt by every Indian and the special thing about it is that we were listening to the voice of Sardar Saheb in the context of his highest statue.

Just as one feels peaceful and receives a new energy on coming to a holy place, I have the same feeling after coming to Sardar Saheb. It seems as if his statue also has a personality, strength, and a message; equally large, equally visionary and equally sacred. This magnificent statue has been built by iron received from the farmers from different corners of the country, using the soil of different parts of the country, and this statue has formed the basis of our diversity, is a living symbol and a message of unity.

Exactly one year ago, the world's tallest statue was dedicated to the country. Today, this statue is attracting and inspiring not only the people of India but also the whole world. Today, the entire nation is feeling proud by paying homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel from this inspirational place.

Just a short while ago, to reiterate the message of national unity, to live the mantra of unity, and to reflect the spirit of unity; and to remind everyone that unity is our culture, our future dreams, Run For Unity was completed in every corner of India. In different cities of the country, in villages, in different areas, the citizens of the country, young and elderly, men and women, have participated in it enthusiastically. National unity parade has also been organized here today. I welcome every citizen to participate in these grand events.

Friends, there are different countries, different creeds, ideologies, different languages ​​in the whole world; People have become involved in the formation of every country in the world and the process continued. But let us never forget that uniformity has been the main feature and identity of those countries, and the countries have tried very systematically to mould these features. Be it good, bad, right or wrong - history keeps assessing itself but one had to put a lot of efforts.

But the identity of India is different. The specialty of India is unity in diversity. We are full of variations. Unity in diversity is our pride, our dignity and our identity. Diversity is celebrated here. We have never seen any conflict in diversity over centuries; rather we can see the power of unity in diversity.

The celebration of diversity or the festival of diversity touches the feature of unity hidden within it, brings it out, inspires to live and inspires to connect. One's goal starts connecting with it and the goals are also fulfilled one after the other.

When we take pride in the different languages ​​and hundreds of dialects of the country, then an emotional connection develops even though the dialects are different; When we consider our different food habits, costumes to be our rich heritage, then a sweetness of belongingness is attached to it; When we join the festivals of different regions, their joy and happiness increases and new colours are added to the festivals.

As we enjoy the traditions, characteristics, cultures, variations of different states, then a sense of Indianness and the pride of India blossom in all four directions. When we respect different creeds, sects, their traditions, beliefs equally, then harmony and affection also increase manifold. So, we must celebrate every opportunity of diversity, as a festival. It must be celebrated. One must be connected with it and this is what 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'. This is Nation Building.

Friends, This is the power that will not be found in any other country of the world. Adi Shankaracharya, from the south, had gone to the north and had established monasteries after reaching the Himalayas. Swami Vivekananda, from Bengal, became enlightened in Kanyakumari, the southern tip of the country. Born in Patna, Guru Govind Singh ji had gone to Punjab and established Khalsa Panth to protect the country. APJ Abdul Kalam, born in Rameshwaram, had occupied the highest position of the country in Delhi. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who had taken birth in the land of Porbandar in Gujarat, had awakened the country by going to Champaran, Bihar and therefore I believe that It is very important to celebrate the festival of unity ceaselessly.

It is this strength of unity through which Indianness flows; it is this strength of unity which is the inspiration of our Constitution written by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar in true sense. We the people of India-these are not just three or four words or just the beginning of our constitution, but it is our ancient cultural history, tradition, faith and reflection which embodies the sense of unity of Indians into words.

Friends, Let me give you an example from sports. We know that when a game begins in the village, then both the teams of the same village put all their efforts to win. One loses, the other wins; the winner moves to the Tehsil. When the game is played inside the Tehsil, then the people of that village, including the losing team and the people of the Tehsil also stand together with the team to help it win in Tehsil. Similarly, the team losing at Tehsil level joins to help the team win further at district level and the whole district comes together to help the team win and when the team represents the district in the state, the district moves forward and when the state competes within the country, all are united for the victory of the state. Victory or defeat does not matter.

When the team reaches international level, everyone forgets where the team was from, where the player was from, what was his language, whether he defeated someone or not; Everybody forgets and when he carries the tri-colour of India on his shoulders and runs for victory, the entire nation runs with him cheering for Mother India; This is the strength of unity that we experience.

When the tri-colour is hoisted after winning the Medal on foreign soil, every Indian from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari, from Maharashtra to Manipur is thrilled. Everyone's excited.

Friends, when Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel went out to work for the integration of more than 500 princely states, it was this magnetic force which drew most of the princely states together. At that time, there was a feeling of Indianness somewhere in every prince and people there. In the period of slavery for hundreds of years, these expressions of Indianness may or may not have been expressed or revealed by the princely states, but this sense of Indianness, despite the years of slavery, despite all kinds of crises and greed, was never lost in any corner of India and hence when Sardar Saheb started off with his mantra of unity, everyone welcomed it with open arms.

And brothers and sisters, we must always remember those centuries back, there was another great name in the history of India that dreamed of one India by wishing to unite all the princely states, uniting the different traditions and diversities, and making a successful attempt in the revival of the nation - and that personality was Chanakya. Chanakya, centuries ago, attempted to unify the country in his period. After Chanakya, if someone could do this work after centuries, then it was our Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Otherwise, the British had wanted India to split apart with independence. But with his will power, Sardar Patel defeated all the anti-national forces by uniting the country.

Brothers and sisters, today our influence is growing and image is improving at the international platform because of our unity. Unity in diversity - this is our identity. Today the whole world pays attention to India seriously. It is because of India's great culture, great tradition from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari and Attock to Cuttack. And that is our strength.

Today, India is making its place among the major economic forces of the world, gaining its rightful place. It could be due to finances, rupees, dollars and pounds, but the true strength behind it is the unity of the country, the resolve of the countrymen, the effort of the countrymen, as well as the unfathomable, tireless effort and diligence to prove the resolve of the countrymen. This diversity in India is a wonder and a magic for the world, but for us Indians, it is our inbred life stream. This is the life stream that has continuously flowed through us by becoming our tradition and culture from time immemorial, on which Sardar Patel had an unwavering faith.

Friends, 

In the 21st century, this unity of India, and of the Indians, is the biggest challenge before the opponents of India. Today on National Integration Day, I am reminding every citizen of this challenge before the country. Many came, many went; there were big dreams with big objectives. However, one thing we must agree with - such a personality can never fade away.

Brothers and sisters, 

Those who cannot win the war are challenging our unity, are trying to destroy our unity, and promote separatism. They are challenging our sense of unity. The essence of unity that has survived within us for centuries is challenged, but they forget that despite similar efforts for centuries, no one could erase us, and no one could defeat our unity.

And so friends, when there are things that emphasize unity in our diversity, they have the power to give a befitting reply to these forces. When we walk on the path of unity through our diversities, these forces are shattered and hence we 130 crore Indians have to stand united and fight against them and this is what is a true tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. We have to succeed in every such test.

Brothers and sisters, 

With the blessings of Sardar Saheb, the country has taken a major decision to defeat these forces only a few weeks ago. 

Friends, Article-370 has given nothing except separatism and terrorism to Jammu and Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir was the only place in the entire country where Article-370 was applied, and Jammu and Kashmir was the only place in the whole country where in three decades, terrorism had taken away lives of more than 40,000 people. Many mothers have lost their sons, many sisters have lost their brothers, and many children have lost their parents.

Friends, 

For how long will the country continue to witness the death of innocents? Friends, this article 370 had created a temporary wall among us Indians for decades. Our brothers and sisters, who were on the other side of this temporary wall, were also confused. This wall was increasing separatism and terrorism in Kashmir. Today I am standing in front of this magnificent statue of Sardar Saheb, bowing my head, and I am giving account to Sardar Saheb with all humility. This was Sardar Saheb's unfulfilled dream - and now that wall has been demolished.

Brothers and sisters, Sardar Patel had once said that if the issue of Kashmir had remained with him, it would not have taken so long to resolve it. He went on to warn the country that complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India is the only solution. Today, on his birth anniversary, standing in front of this magnificent statue today, wherever the soul of Sardar Saheb is, I dedicate the great decision taken on August 5th with an overwhelming majority in the Parliament of India, to Sardar Saheb. It is a privilege for all of us that we have got the opportunity to fulfill the unfulfilled dream of Sardar Saheb. We are also glad that from today, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are moving towards a new future and it is a great delight that Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir are starting their new journeys towards their brighter future on the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the advocate of unity.

Brothers and sisters, just last week there were elections to the Block Development Council. You will be surprised to know that even after so many years of independence; no democratic rights were given to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. People only talked of democracy. Section 370 was used as an excuse. BDC elections were never held. Just like week, BDC elections were held for the first time since independence. Panch-sarpanch are the voters. 98% of the voters had voted. This partnership is a message of unity in itself, and a sacred remembrance of Sardar Saheb.

Now there will be a political stability in Jammu and Kashmir, now the game of formation and toppling of governments for personal gains will cease. Now the discrimination and complaints of discrimination on the basis of region will come to an end. Now the development journey through Co-operative Federalism will begin. New highways, new railway lines, new schools, new colleges, new hospitals, will take people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to new heights of development.

Friends, I had made another promise to the people of Jammu and Kashmir in my address to the nation in the month of August. I had said that the employees of the State, Jammu and Kashmir Police would get facilities at par with the employees of the Union Territories. I am glad that from today onwards all the employees of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh will start getting benefit of allowances approved by the Seventh Pay Commission.

Friends, The new arrangements in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are not for drawing lines on the ground. I am saying it with a great responsibility. This is not our decision to draw lines on the ground but is a meaningful beginning to build a strong link of faith. It is the same thing which Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had also wished for Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. And I repeat - we will defeat every attack on the unity of the country; we will give a befitting reply to such attacks. Any attempt to break the unity of the country can never stand before the democratic strength and public sentiment which are way too strong.

 

Friends, With the inspiration of Sardar Saheb, we are carrying forward the tradition of emphasizing upon emotional, economic and constitutional integration of the entire country. This is an effort without which we cannot imagine the strength of India in the 21st century world.

Brothers and sisters, Remember there was a time when the trust gap between the North-East and the rest of India was becoming so deep. There were repeated questions about both physical connectivity and emotional connectivity. But now the conditions are changing. Today the isolation of North-East is turning into attachment. Decades-old problems are now moving towards a solution. The entire North East is being liberated from a long period of violence and blockade and this is being done not by pressure, but by adding emotional ties with them. Other efforts for integration in the country are also underway. This is a continuous process, and our continuous responsibility, it is also the responsibility of all countrymen.

And so brothers and sisters, Our ceaseless efforts are going on in this direction. For example, Aadhaar. Aadhaar means one nation one identity. GST means One Nation One Tax. E-NAM means one nation one agriculture market. For electricity and gas, there should be one nation one grid, there should be one nation one mobility card, one nation one optical fiber network, or one nation one ration card. All these efforts are strengthening the vision of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.

Brothers and sisters, Sardar Saheb used to say - Unity of Purpose, Unity of Aims and Unity of Endeavour are essential for stability in India. There should be equality in our objectives, equality in our goals and equality in our efforts.

Brothers and sisters, 

Over the years, we have tried to strengthen India's collective strength, our real strength, with the same objective of building a New India. We have tried to reduce the 'government' from the lives of ordinary citizens and making the citizens partner in building India's future. Today, the citizen is not only aware of his rights, but also more active and aware of his duties. Today, every citizen of India has come forward to fulfill his obligation towards the nation's cleanliness. He has started accepting it as his obligation. When I talk of Fit India, he is perceiving fitness too as his contribution towards the country. He has started considering water saving as his national duty. Once he used to consider it as a compulsion to follow rules and regulations, but today he is fulfilling it as his responsibility. Now when he leaves the house, he keeps a cloth bag with him, so that there is no need to use plastic.

Friends, I call upon the entire nation to come forward - recalling the archaic proclamation that has always inspired us. We have heard it several times, have tried to understand it several times, but as the country is moving forward, now every Indian has to take the country forward by living that mantra and that mantra is -

सं गच्छ-ध्वं, सं वद-ध्वं, सं वो मनांसि जानताम्

That is, let us all walk together, speak in one voice, and move forward with one mind.

Friends, This is the path of unity on which the resolution of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' will be fulfilled, and a New India will be built.

Finally, Once again my best wishes to all of you and the whole nation for Rashtriya Ekta Diwas. And today I feel, this magnificent statue of Sardar Saheb- is not merely a place, but a source of inspiration. And I believe that the seed of unity which he had sown will grow into a fruitful tree today in every corner of India and 130 crore dreams are flourishing under its shade due to which the world is being convinced. A new belief is being created in the world. And so we have to enrich the seed sown by Sardar Saheb with our own hard work, our dreams, and resolutions, and we have to take ahead the path of public welfare to the welfare of the world.

Today once again from my side and on behalf of the countrymen and the government of India, I pay respectful tribute to Sardar Saheb by bowing my head down on his birth anniversary. Thank you so much. With both your fists in the air, say with me-

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

The Prime Minister was briefed on Aarambh (Beginning) - the first of its kind week long unique comprehensive foundation course. In a lively interactive session, officer trainees gave presentations on 5 thematic areas namely Agriculture and Rural Empowerment, Health care reforms and policymaking; sustainable rural management techniques, inclusive urbanization and future of education. 

The Prime Minister was also briefed on the highlights of the various sessions conducted on topical issues by World Bank Chairman Mr. David Malpass, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Cabinet Secretary, scholars and analysts from the Institute of Future and University of Diversity. 

In the interactive session which followed, PM noted that it was indeed praise-worthy that this course was being organized on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who is considered the founding father of Indian Civil Services.

“The Indian Civil Service owes a lot to Sardar Patel. From here in Kevadia, where the ‘Statue of Unity’ is, may we all find inspiration and vigour to do something for our nation. Let us work towards making India a five trillion dollar economy” he said.

Prime Minister described the Aarambh Foundation course as a unique future centric one with the potential to bring about a paradigm shift in administration. 

“This course, Aarambh, is nation-centric and future-centric. It will usher a paradigm shift in administration, whereby people stop working on silos. Instead, people work together and in a comprehensive manner”

Exhorting the trainees to change the way they look at things, he said sometimes change in terminology also helps in changing the perspective.

“Let’s change how we look at things. Even something like a changed terminology helps. Earlier, people would keep saying backward districts. Today we say- aspirational districts. Why should any posting be a punishment posting. Why not see it as an opportunity posting”

While appreciating the commitment shown by the officer trainees and their new ideas, Prime Minister expressed hope that the exposure provided by this unique training course on global best practices and technologies, will prove to be beneficial in their careers ahead in policy making and public administration. 

He said that they should strive to remove silos and hierarchies in the system. “The presence of silos and hierarchy doesn’t help our system. Whoever we are, wherever we are, we have to work together for the nation”

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi today lauded India’s rich diversity and thousands of years old ways of life which help in National Unity and in our resolve to stand united.

He was addressing on the occasion of the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas, to commemorate the Birth Anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, at Kevadiya today.

“We have our pride in our Unity in Diversity. We derive our respect and identity out of it” he said.

“We celebrate our Unity in Diversity. We don’t find any contradictions in our diversity, rather we find a strong thread of Unity in it”

“The celebration of diversity, the festival of diversity actually touches the chord of unity in our hearts”, he said.

“When we respect our different ways of life & traditions then the feeling of harmony and brotherhood would develop further; hence at every moment we have to celebrate our diversity and this is nation building”

He said, “This diversity is one such power of India, which cannot be found anywhere else in the World. Shankara coming from south India, had established monasteries in the north and Swami Vivekananda from Bengal attained knowledge at Kanyakumari in the south.”

“Here Guru Gobind Singh born in Patna established the Khalsa Panth in the Punjab and A P J Abdul Kalam who was born in Rameshwaram attained the highest post of the country in Delhi”

Referring to the phrase “We the People of India” in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, he said “this is not a mere phrase at the beginning of the constitution but the representation of the thousands of year old fabric of life in India. “

“When Sardar Patel was on the herculean task of integrating more than 500 Princely states into India, it was this magnetic power which attracted most them into the country”

He said today India’s good will and influence is on the rise in the comity of nations and that this is due to our Unity.

“Today the entire world takes India seriously and that is due to our national unity. If India is one of the biggest economies in the World, it is due to our national unity”, he said.

Prime Minister said, “Those who cannot win wars against us, they are challenging our unity. But they forget, despite yearning for ages, none has been able to vanquish the spirit of unity within us”.

He said, “With the blessings of Sardar Patel, the country has taken a major decision a few weeks ago to defeat such separatist forces, that is to abrogate the Article 370”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Article 370 of the Indian Constitution only gave separatism and terrorism to Jammu & Kashmir.

He said for decades the presence of this article only erected an artificial wall of schism between the people of the country.

Prime Minister was addressing on the occasion of the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas, to commemorate the Birth Anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, at Kevadiya today.

He said Article 370 contributed to nothing but separatist attitude and terrorism and that our brothers and sisters who were on the other side of this artificial wall were confused.

Prime Minister said that this wall had now been demolished.

“In the entire country, Jammu and Kashmir was the only place where this Article 370 existed” he said.

He said, “In the last three decades more than 40,000 people lost lives due to terrorist activities, several mothers lost their children, sisters lost their brothers and kids their parents”.

Prime Minister said, “Once Sardar Patel commented that if the issue of J&K were left to me, it would not have taken this long to resolve it. “

He said, “I dedicate the decision of abrogation of Article 3790 to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his birth anniversary”

“I am happy that this decision of ours, would now lead Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh towards a bright future and on the path of progress.”

Referring to the recent Block Development Council elections in Jammu & Kashmir, the Prime Minister said, “the voter turn around was more than 98%. The voters who are Panchs and Sarpanchs have turned out in large numbers to cast their ballot and that this gives a huge message.”

Prime Minister said, “Now the era of political stability would begin in Jammu & Kashmir. The game of forming governments for individual selfish reasons would end and that the feeling of discrimination on regional lines would also diminish”

“An era of true participation in the cooperative federalism would begin in the region. New Highways, new railway lines, new schools, new colleges, new hospitals would take Jammu & Kashmir to new heights of progress”

Referring to the progress being made in the North – East, the Prime Minister said “Today the separatist tendencies in the North East are moving towards assimilation and progress. Decades old problems are now finding solutions. Entire North –East is today finding itself free of decades old violence and blockades”

He said, “With the inspiration drawn from the work of Sardar Patel, we are providing a fillip for the complete emotional, economic and constitutional integration of the country. This is one such effort, without which we cannot visualise a strong India in the twenty first century.”

Referring to the ideals of Sardar Patel, the Prime Minister said, “Unity of Purpose, Unity of Endeavour and Unity of Aims are essential for the stability of country and that this was the ideology of Sardar Patel, that we have an egalitarian attitude in our objectives, purpose and targets”

Prime Minister said that when we go ahead on this path of National Unity only then we can achieve the goal of “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.”

PM: सरदार साहेब के आशीर्वाद से, इन ताकतों को परास्त करने का एक बहुत बड़ा फैसला देश ने कुछ हफ्ते पहले ही लिया है। आर्टिकल 370 ने जम्मू-कश्मीर को अलगाववाद और आतंकवाद के सिवाय कुछ नहीं दिया।— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019
PM: पूरे देश में जम्मू-कश्मीर ही एकमात्र स्थान था जहां आर्टिकल 370 था और पूरे देश में जम्मू-कश्मीर ही एकमात्र स्थान था जहां तीन दशकों में आतंकवाद ने करीब-करीब 40 हजार लोगों की जान ले ली।— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019

PM: दशकों तक हम भारतीयों के बीच इस आर्टिकल 370 ने एक अस्थाई दीवार बना रखी थी।हमारे जो भाई-बहन इस अस्थाई दीवार के उस पार थे, वो भी असमंजस में रहते थे।जो दीवार कश्मीर में अलगाववाद और आतंकवाद बढ़ा रही थी, अब वो दीवार गिरा दी गई है।— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019
PM: कभी सरदार पटेल ने कहा था कि अगर कश्मीर का मसला उनके पास रहा होता, तो उसे सुलझने में इतनी देर नहीं होती।आज उनकी जन्म जयंती पर, मैं आर्टिकल 370 को हटाने का फैसला, सरदार साहेब को समर्पित करता हूं।pic.twitter.com/ss1cGc57y2— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019
PM: हमें इस बात की भी खुशी है कि आज से ही जम्मू-कश्मीर और लद्दाख, एक नए भविष्य की ओर कदम बढ़ा रहे हैं।हाल ही में वहां, ब्लॉक डवलपमेंट काउंसिल के चुनाव में 98 प्रतिशत पंचों-सरपंचों की भागीदारी एक बड़ा संदेश है।— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019

PM: अब जम्मू कश्मीर में एक राजनीतिक स्थिरता आएगी।अब निजी स्वार्थ के लिए सरकारें बनाने और गिराने का खेल बंद होगा।अब क्षेत्र के आधार पर भेदभाव के शिकवे और शिकायतें भी दूर होंगी।— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019

PM: अब Co-Operative Federalism की असली भागीदारी देखने को मिलेगी।नए हाईवे, नई रेलवे लाइनें, नए स्कूल, नए कॉलेज, नए अस्पताल, जम्मू-कश्मीर के लोगों के विकास को नई ऊँचाई पर ले जाएंगे।— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019

PM: मुझे खुशी है कि आज से जम्मू-कश्मीर और लद्दाख के सभी सरकारी कर्मचारियों को सातवें वेतन आयोग द्वारा स्वीकृत भत्तों का लाभ मिलना भी शुरू हो जाएगा।— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019
PM: जम्मू-कश्मीर और लद्दाख में नई व्यवस्थाएं ज़मीन पर लकीरें खींचने के लिए नहीं है, बल्कि विश्वास की एक मज़बूत कड़ी बनाने के लिए है।यही विश्वास है जिसकी कामना सरदार पटेल ने भी जम्मू कश्मीर और लद्दाख के लिए की थी।— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019
PM: सरदार साहेब की प्रेरणा से ही हम संपूर्ण भारत के Emotional, Economic और Constitutional Integration पर बल दे रहे हैं।ये वो प्रयास हैं जिसके बगैर 21वीं सदी के विश्व में भारत की मज़बूती की कल्पना हम नहीं कर सकते।— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 31, 2019

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi shall pay tributes to Iron Man of India Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the Statue of Unity, Kevadiya, Gujarat on the occasion of Sardar’s Birth Anniversary, on 31st October 2019.

Prime Minister Modi shall also participate at the Ekta Diwas Parade, visit the Technology Demonstration Site and later interact with Civil Service Probationers at Kevadiya.

Since 2014, October 31st is observed as National Unity Day and people from all walks of life participate in the Run For Unity.

In his Mann Ki Baat Programme on the 27th of October, 2019 Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to participate in large numbers in the ‘Run For Unity’ towards One Goal – “Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat.”

“Friends, as you know that 31st October every year since 2014 has been celebrated as 'National Unity Day'. This day imparts the message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost. On 31st October, this year too ‘Run for Unity’ is being organized like the previous years. ‘Run for Unity’ is a symbol of unison, that the nation being united, is moving in one direction and collectively aims for- One goal! Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat!”, he said.

“My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the nation with the thread of unison. This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our life and in a country like ours filled with diversities, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unison on all paths, at every bend, and at every pit-stop. My dear countrymen, our nation has always been very proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the country. If we look around us, we will find many examples of individuals who have been working ceaselessly to foster communal harmony.”

Prime Minister further said, “the last five years have witnessed - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, union territories, state capitals, district centres, even in small cities belonging to tier two or tier three categories, innumerable men, women, be they the city folk, village folk, children, the youth, the elderly, divyang, all are participating in ‘Run for Unity’ in large numbers.”

Stressing on the importance of a Fit India, the Prime Minister said ‘Run for Unity’ is one such unique event which is beneficial for the mind, body and soul. “During ‘Run for Unity’ not only do we have to run, but in doing so the spirit of FIT India is also reflected. We also find ourselves connected with Ek Bharat- Shrestha Bharat! And so, not just our body, but our mind and value system get integrated with ushering unity in India to take India to loftier heights! “

A web portal runforunity.gov.in has also been launched where in one can find information about various venues for the Run For Unity, that is being organised across the country.

                Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, Ladies & Gentleman, Friends, Namaskar, Good Evening!

I would like to thank His Majesty the King and the Custodian of the two holy mosques and my brother His Royal Highness the Crown Prince for inviting me to participate in this Forum. Saudi Arabia and the holy mosques located here have been the center of faith of crores of people around the world. This land has also been a source of energy for the world economy. Today I can also feel a positive energy amidst you in this energetic city of Riyadh.

Friends,

The topics of the Future Investment Initiative Forum make it clear that the purpose of this Forum is not just to discuss the economy here. It is also to understand the emerging trends in the world and find avenues for the world's welfare in it. For this reason, this dynamic platform has become an important part of the calendar of the business world. In just a short span of three years, this Forum has come a long way. My friend and brother Crown Prince deserves many congratulations for this success. His forum is called Davos of the Desert. In the last century, due to the hard work of the people of Saudi Arabia and the nature's gift, the sand of the desert has produced gold. The leadership of Saudi Arabia could have just sat comfortably, but it thought about many generations to come, and has shown concern about the future and has taken care of the whole humanity. I also congratulate His Highness Crown Prince that he did not just name this Forum as Future for the sake of it, but rather its whole concept is forward looking and oriented towards the future. In this way, being his brother and neighbour, it is only natural for me to represent the world's fastest growing economy in this excellent initiative.

Friends,

I have brought the good wishes of the people of India for you. We have been with Saudi Arabia for thousands of years. There has been such a friendship, as you say - Sadakatum, that we feel connected with each other. Our historical ties and contacts have also laid a strong foundation stone for our strategic partnership. And today we have given a new height to our relationship by establishing a Strategic Partnership Council after discussion with the Crown Prince. With the guidance of His Majesty the King and His Royal Highness Crown Prince, we have been able to bring unexpected progress and a sense of belonging in the relationship. I thank him for his efforts and his affection for India.

Friends,

Today at Future Investment Initiative, I have the opportunity to speak on ""What's next for Global Business"" and the emerging opportunities and possibilities in India, our expectations and goals. India has set the goal of doubling its economy in the next five years, making it a 5 trillion dollars economy. In such a scenario, this topic becomes all the more relevant and important.

Friends,

Today, as we want to accelerate growth in India, we have to understand the emerging trends well. Therefore, today I would like to talk to you about the five big trends that are influencing global business. The first trend is - Impact of Technology and Innovation; the Second - Importance of Infrastructure for Global Growth; the Third - Changes coming in human resource and future of work; the Fourth - compassion for environment and the fifth Trend is - Business friendly governance.

Friends!

We are all witnesses to the growing influence of technology and innovation. Transformative technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Genetics and Nano-technology have moved beyond research to become a part of everyday life. This change of technology has benefited the societies which have developed a culture of adopting new technologies and further innovation on them. In India, we have tried at many levels to strengthen this culture, be it start-up challenges or Hackathons for the youth or Atal Tinkering labs for school children, where they experience innovation themselves. Today a comprehensive eco-system from research and development to tech-entrepreneurship is being prepared in India. The results of our efforts have also started showing up. Today India has become the third largest startup ecosystem in the world. Start-ups have also emerged in India's Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. The number of unicorns with valuations exceeding US $ 1 billion is increasing in India. Many of our start-ups are investing globally. Indian start-ups are acing everything, from food delivery to transport, to hospitality, to medical treatment, to tourism. And therefore, I request all the investors of the world, especially venture funds, to take advantage of our start-up ecosystem. I am confident that the investment in innovation in India will generate the highest returns. And these returns will also empower the youth.

Friends!

The importance of Infrastructure for global growth and development of business is constantly increasing. I believe that Infrastructure is an opportunity multiplier. Infrastructure provides businesses huge investment opportunities and at the same time infrastructure is necessary for business growth.

Friends,

Today, the opportunities for physical infrastructure in the world are available mostly in developing countries. In Asia, we need to invest $ 700 billion per year in infrastructure. In India, we have set a target of investing $ 1.5 trillion in infrastructure in the next few years. And then, today we do not think about infrastructure in isolation but our effort is to ensure an integrated approach. One Nation One Power Grid, One Nation One gas grid, and One Water grid, One Nation One Mobility Card, One Nation One Optical Fiber Network - with many such efforts, we are integrating the infrastructure of India. We have set a target of providing every Indian with a home, and to provide electricity and tap-water to every household. We have also seen unprecedented speed and scale of infrastructure development. And therefore, the growth of infrastructure in India will remain in double-digit, and there is no scope for capacity saturation. As a result, the returns to investors will also be ensured.

Friends,

The third trend, i.e. change in human resources and future of work is also very important. Today's international investment decisions depend on the availability of quality manpower. Also, skilled manpower has become the criterion of valuation of any company. In such a scenario, making the people skilled fast is a challenge before us. As the nature of work is changing, we will have to re-skill people several times in the coming years. The cycles of Learn-unlearn and re-learn will become necessary.

Friends!

India's skilled human resources have gained respect and reputation around the world. Indian talent has carved a unique identity here in Saudi Arabia as a disciplined, law-abiding, hard-working and skilled workforce. To develop skill in India, we have developed a comprehensive vision and are continuously working on it. Through the Skill India initiative, we will train 400 million people in different skills in the next three-four years. Companies investing in India will get assured skilled manpower from it.

Friends,

The economy of the world will grow by making the movement of skilled manpower easier. I believe that we should not limit international trade agreements to only goods but also simplify it by making manpower and talent mobility an integral part of it.

Friends!

The fourth trend i.e. compassion for environment is not only a trend, but has also become a major necessity of our time. The impact of climate change and the importance of clean energy are so extensive that they cannot be ignored. Our energy consumption pattern will change further in the coming years. The inclination will increase from coal to oil, then oil to gas and finally towards renewables. Both energy consumption and energy savings will be important, and storage also. The challenges of environmental degradation will also increase. Realizing the same, in India, we are increasing the amount of investment in gas and oil infrastructure. We aim to invest up to $ 100 billion in refining, pipelines and gas terminals by 2024. I am glad that Saudi Aramco has decided to invest in India's West Coast Refinery Project, which will be Asia's largest refinery. We have recently liberalized the investment criteria in the downstream sector, especially in retailing, which will increase the ease of doing business in this sector. Besides this, the target of generating 175 GW of energy in Renewables will also be increased to 450 GW in the coming years. Investment in energy is very important for India's fast growing economy. And we request the energy companies present here to take advantage of these opportunities.

Friends!

Last but not the least, the fifth trend i.e. the changing role of the government and its impact on the future of business is also very wide. My emphasis has always been on Minimum Government Maximum Governance. I think a proactive and transparent government can play the role of a good facilitator for a competitive, innovative and dynamic business sector. Clear rules and a fair system are necessary for the growth of the private sector. With this same thinking and approach, we have made several major structural reforms in India in the last five years. Today, India has become the biggest destination of foreign investment due to the smooth and liberalizing FDI policy. There has been $ 286 billion of Foreign Direct Investment in India in the last 5 years. This is almost half of India's total FDI Inflow in the last 20 years. We have made tough decisions like the Insolvency and bankruptcy code and country-wide a single taxation system. Today India's tax structure and IPR regime are comparable with the best business regimes in the world. Due to such reforms, India has been consistently doing better in every Global Ranking. We improved by 10 ranks in the Logistics Performance Index, jumped by 24 rank in Global Innovation Index. We were at 142th position in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index in 2014, while today we are at 63rd position in 2019. For the third year in a row, we are among the top 10 reforms in the world. We have also abolished more than 1500 such archaic laws which were creating bottlenecks in development.

Friends,

In the last four-five years, more than 350 million people have been connected to the banking system. Today almost every citizen in India has a unique ID, Mobile Phone and Bank Account. This arrangement led to the plugging of leakage of more than $ 20 billion through a transparent process of Direct Benefit Transfer. That means, it saved 20 billion dollars. Healthcare is an important responsibility of any government. India has taken several steps to improve the quality of service in this area. Ayushman Bharat, the world's largest government health care programme, provides health cover to more than 500 million people i.e. more than the total population of America, Canada and Mexico. Moreover, due to this scheme, the possibilities of investment in health care in India have increased immensely. Today India is also the largest health care consumer and quality healthcare provider. The use of technology has revolutionized the healthcare sector. This has not only created economic opportunities, but has also increased the productivity of crores of people.

Friends,

Today, I want to assure you from this platform that this pace of progress in India will be faster. We are taking every decision related to the development of the country. Our policies are unambiguous and our goal is fixed. The roadmap for our $ 5 trillion economy goal is ready. This goal is not only for quantitative growth but also to improve the quality of life of every Indian. We are improving not only ease of doing business but also ease of living. Due to political stability, predictable policy and large diverse market, your investment will be most profitable in India.

Friends,

The cooperation of our partner countries is an integral part of our development journey. By exploring complementarity with all countries, and increasing synergy, we are working for a win-win solution. We will stand by Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 and the schemes to diversify the economy.

Friends,

India will complete 75 years of independence in 2022. Till that time, we have set the goal of making a 'NEW INDIA' for ourselves. In that NEW INDIA, every Indian will have new dreams, a new strength in the heart and new energy in the steps. There will be a new potential in that New India.

Friends

That capable and powerful India will be a source of peace and joy not only for us, but for the whole world. History is a witness to the fact that even when India was the largest economy in the world and it was strong militarily, we did not pressurize anyone and did not use force on anyone. India has shared its capabilities and achievements with the whole world. Because we have considered the whole world as one family - 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'! There will be a new strength in the New India, but the same eternal soul will be reflected in its thinking. Our development will create confidence in the world. Our progress will increase mutual love. I invite you and the businesses from all over the world, to partner with India in this journey of the world's welfare. I and my team are always ready to help you. You gave me an opportunity to share some of my thoughts. I thank you very much for lending your ears to me. Once again I offer my heartfelt gratitude to the Crown Prince and the Kingdom. With that I end my speech.

Thank you very much.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi delivered a keynote address at Future Investment Initiative Forum in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that his aim was to empower the poorest of the poor and ensure they lead a life of dignity. He said  “I am always thinking- how can India contribute to global good.'' He added that whatever we are doing in India will strengthen global initiatives too. Take for instance our aim to end TB in 2025, before the global target of 2030. When India succeeds, the world will be a healthier place.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi met King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan His Majesty Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein today on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The two leaders exchanged views on strengthening bilateral relations, including MoUs and Agreements signed during His Majesty's visit to India from 27 February -01 March 2018. They discussed the Middle East Peace Process and other regional developments. Both leaders also discussed cooperation in counter-terrorism.


Historical links, cultural affinities and people-to-people contacts between India and Jordan have existed since times immemorial. Prime Minister's visit to Jordan and King's visit to India in 2018 have imparted a new momentum in our bilateral relations that are marked by mutual respect and understanding on various bilateral, regional and multilateral issues.

                The signing of the agreement on the Strategic Partnership Council by India and Saudi Arabia would strengthen the already robust relations between the two countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.

Prime Minister who is visiting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was speaking to the Arab News.

This is second visit of Prime Minister Modi to the Kingdom in three years.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the two countries have been working together within the G20 to reduce inequality and promote sustainable development.

Saying stable oil prices are crucial for the growth of the global economy, he praised the Kingdom’s role as an important and reliable source of India’s energy requirements.

Talking about the excellent personal relations between him and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia HRH Mohammad Bin Salman, the Prime Minister said, “Since my first visit to the Kingdom in 2016, I have personally witnessed a remarkable growth in our bilateral relations. I have met His Royal Highness (HRH) Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman five times. I recall with warmth my previous meetings with him, and look forward to meeting him again during this visit. 
I am confident that under the leadership of His Majesty King Salman and HRH Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, bilateral relations between India and Saudi Arabia will only grow stronger.”

Prime Minister said, “Neighbourhood First” continues to be the guiding vision for my government’s foreign policy. India’s relations with Saudi Arabia are one of the most important bilateral relationships in our extended neighbourhood.”

On the agreement on Strategic Partnership Council which is going to be signed during this visit, he said, “will begin a new era of cooperation across sectors. Our ties across various dimensions such as trade, investment, security and defence cooperation are robust and deep, and will only strengthen further.”

“I believe that Asian powers like India and Saudi Arabia share similar security concerns in their neighbourhood. In that respect, I am happy that our cooperation, particularly in the field of counterterrorism, security and strategic issues, is progressing very well. My national security adviser just visited Riyadh for a very productive visit.”  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India and Saudi Arabia have a Joint Committee on Defence Cooperation that holds regular meetings and that the two nations have identified a number of areas of mutual interest and cooperation in the field of defence and security.

“We are also in the process of entering into agreements on security cooperation, collaboration in defence industries, and also agreed to hold a comprehensive security dialogue mechanism between the two countries”, he said.

On the question of turmoil in several regions of West Asia, the Prime Minister called for ‘a balanced approach to resolve the conflicts, while respecting the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in each other’s internal matters’.

He said, “India shares excellent bilateral relations with all the countries in the region, and a very large Indian diaspora, numbering over 8 million, resides in the region. A dialogue process that encourages the participation of all stakeholders is important to bring peace and security to this very important region.”

On his outlook on the current global economy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “The global economic outlook is strongly dependent on the path chartered by the large developing countries such as India. As I mentioned in my speech at the UN General Assembly in September, we sincerely believe that we need collective efforts, for the growth of all, with everyone’s trust.”

He said, “Economic uncertainty is an offshoot of unbalanced multilateral trade systems. Within the G20, India and Saudi Arabia have been working together to reduce inequality and promote sustainable development. I am happy to note that Saudi Arabia will be hosting the G20 Summit next year and India will host it in 2022, which is also the 75th anniversary of our independence.”

On the question of the current sluggishness in the Western Economies and the role of India and Saudi Arabia in such a scenario, the Prime Minister said, “India has undertaken many reforms to create a business-friendly environment, and to ensure that we remain a major driver of global growth and stability. Our reforms for ease of doing business and introducing investor-friendly initiatives have contributed to improving our position in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2019.”

“A number of major flagship initiatives, like Make in India, Digital India, Skill India, Swachh Bharat, Smart Cities and Startup India, are offering a lot of opportunities to foreign investors. Similarly, I am happy to note that Saudi Arabia too has embarked upon a reform program as part of their Vision 2030.”

On the long term energy relation with Saudi Arabia, which is the largest Oil supplier to India, he said, “India imports around 18 percent of its crude oil from the Kingdom, making it the second-largest source of crude oil for us. From a purely buyer-seller relationship, we are now moving toward a closer strategic partnership that will include Saudi investments in downstream oil and gas projects.”

“We value the Kingdom’s vital role as an important and reliable source of our energy requirements. We believe that stable oil prices are crucial for the growth of the global economy, particularly for developing countries. Saudi Aramco is participating in a major refinery and petrochemical project on India’s west coast. We are also looking forward to the participation of Aramco in India’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves.”

On the question whether India would like Saudi Arabia’s participation in the massive Smart City projects announced by the Government, Prime Minister Modi said, “One of the major areas of cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia is in investments in our infrastructure projects. During his visit to India in February 2019, the crown prince had indicated an intent to invest in excess of $100 billion in India across various sectors.”

“We welcome greater Saudi investments in our infrastructure projects, including the Smart Cities program. We also welcome Saudi interest in investing in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.”

Talking about the areas other than energy, in which India and Saudi Arabia can cooperate, the Prime Minister said, “I am happy to share with you that during my visit this time, India and Saudi Arabia plan to enter into agreements in various areas, including defense, security, renewable energy etc.”

“Other major initiatives include the proposal to launch the RuPay card in the Kingdom, which will facilitate payments and remittances by the Indian diaspora; integration of the e-Migrate and e-Thawtheeq portals, which will facilitate the process of migration of Indian labor into the Kingdom; and an agreement on training diplomats in our respective academies.”

“India is known for its world-class capacity-building centers, and there are many initiatives to provide training to the Saudi youth in different fields. We are also discussing mutual cooperation in the field of space research.”

In his message to the Indian Diaspora in Saudi Arabia, the Prime Minister said, “Nearly 2.6 million Indians have made Saudi Arabia their second home, contributing to its growth and development. Many Indians also visit the Kingdom every year for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage, and for business purposes.”

He said, “My message to my fellow citizens is that your country is proud of the place that you have made for yourself in the Kingdom, and your hard work and commitment have helped to generate a lot of goodwill for the overall bilateral relationship.”

“I am confident that you will continue to remain the binding force in our ties with the Kingdom, and further contribute to the strengthening of the historic ties between the two countries, which are based on people-to-people contacts over several decades.”

During the present visit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have bilateral discussions with King Salman and delegation-level talks with the crown prince. These discussions will be in addition to Modi delivering the keynote address at the third Future Investment Initiative (FII) forum, widely seen as the most important economic forum in the Middle East.

Prime Minister Modi’s visit is expected to further strengthen and expand bilateral ties in various areas such as security and strategic cooperation, defence, energy security, renewable energy, investments, trade and commerce, small and medium enterprises, agriculture, civil aviation, infrastructure, housing, financial services, training and capacity building, culture and people-to-people engagement. Nearly a dozen government-to-government agreements related to these areas are expected to be signed, as well as several government-to-business agreements.

One of the most important outcomes of the visit is expected to be the establishment of a Strategic Partnership Council (SPC) between the two countries. India will become the fourth country with which the Kingdom has formed a strategic partnership, the others being the UK, France and China. 
The SPC will have two parallel tracks: Political, security, culture and society, headed by both countries’ foreign ministers; and economy and investment, headed by India’s commerce and industry minister and the Saudi energy minister.

Energy security is one of the prime areas of India’s engagement with Saudi Arabia. New Delhi appreciates the Kingdom’s vital role as a reliable source for India’s long-term energy supplies; the Kingdom supplies 18 percent of India’s crude oil requirements and 30 percent of its liquefied petroleum gas needs. Both countries are keen to transform the buyer-seller relationship in this sector into a much broader strategic partnership based on mutual complementarity and interdependence.

                I am visiting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for a day’s official visit on 29 October 2019. The visit is at the invitation of His Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, King of Saudi Arabia for attending the Plenary Session of the 3rd Future Investment Initiative Forum being held in Riyadh. 

During my visit to Riyadh, I will hold bilateral discussions with His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia.  I will also meet and discuss with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, HRH Mohammed bin Salman several matter of bilateral cooperation as well as regional and global issues of mutual interest.

India and Saudi Arabia have enjoyed traditionally close and friendly relations.  Saudi Arabia has been one of the largest and reliable suppliers of India’s energy needs.

The Crown Prince during his visit to New Delhi in February 2019 committed to invest over US$100 billion in sectors of priority in India.

Defence, security, trade, culture, education and people-to-people contacts are the other important areas of bilateral cooperation with Saudi Arabia.

During the visit, the Agreement for establishment of the Strategic Partnership Council will further elevate the India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership to a new level.

I also look forward to my participation in the Future Investment Initiative Forum where I will speak about the growing trade and investment opportunities for the global investors in India as the country marches forward to a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024.

                Members of European Parliament called on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, New Delhi today.  Prime Minister appreciated the importance the Parliamentarians attach to their relationship with India by visiting right at the beginning of their term.

Prime Minister said that India’s relationship with the European Union is based on shared interests and common commitment to democratic values. He said that an early conclusion of a fair and balanced BTIA is a priority for the government. Talking about the need to strengthen engagement with EU on regional and global matters, Prime Minister highlighted the importance of close international cooperation to fight terrorism. He also mentioned about the growth of International Solar Alliance as a global partnership.



Prime Minister, while welcoming the delegation to India, expressed the hope that they have a fruitful visit to various parts of the country, including to Jammu and Kashmir. Their visit to Jammu and Kashmir should give the delegation a better understanding of the cultural and religious diversity of the region of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh; apart from giving them a clear view of the development and governance priorities of the region.

Prime Minister highlighted the huge jump in India’s position in Ease of Doing Business rankings from 142 in 2014 to 63 currently. He said that this is a massive achievement for a country as enormous in size, demography and diversity as India. Governance systems are today enabling people to move in aspirational direction, he said.

Prime Minister also underlined the focus of the government on ensuring Ease of Living for all Indians. He mentioned about the success of key programmes of the Government including Swachh Bharat and Ayushman Bharat. He reiterated India’s commitment to eliminate TB by 2025, five years before the global target. He also talked about steps taken for environment protection and conservation including enhanced renewable energy targets and movement against single use plastics.

                In continuation of the tradition set in the first tenure, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today celebrated the festival of Diwali with soldiers of Indian Army at the Line of Control in Rajouri district of Jammu & Kashmir. This was the third instance of the Prime Minister celebrating the auspicious festival with the troops in Jammu & Kashmir.

Prime Minister visited the ‘Hall of Fame’ in Rajouri and paid homage to the gallant soldiers and brave citizens who laid down their lives to protect Rajouri and Poonch sectors. He termed the Hall of Fame as ‘Parakram Bhoomi, Prerna Bhoomi, Paavan Bhoomi’.

Later, Prime Minister visited the Pathankot airbase to meet the  air warriors of the Indian Air Force .

Addressing the soldiers, Prime Minister said that everyone endeavours to travel far and wide to celebrate the festival of Diwali with their family and likewise the PM too travelled to be with the members of his family, the brave Jawans of the Armed Forces.

Prime Minister recalled the supreme sacrifices made by the armed forces on October 27 1947, also celebrated as Infantry Day. Hailing the valour of the Indian Defence Forces, he said they have made it possible for the Central Government to take decisions which were hitherto considered impossible. He highlighted the courage and fortitude of the forces in safeguarding national security. He thanked them on behalf of the people of the country for their monumental service.

To pay homage to and mark their contributions, the government endeavoured to etch the landmark National War Memorial in the Capital, the Prime Minister said. He added that the increasing number of visitors to the National War Memorial shows the respect accorded by the citizens towards the contributions of armed forces.

Prime Minister listed the steps being taken by the Government to further strengthen and modernize the Indian defence forces. He added that the Government is committed to taking steps to ensure the welfare of soldiers.

                My dear countrymen, Namaskar. On the pious festival of Deepawali, greetings to all of you. We are familiar with the lines of the Shlok-

        Shubham Karoti Kalyanam, Aarogyam Dhansampadaa.   

       Shatrubudhdhi Vinashaay, Deepajyoti Namostute!!

What a fine, purposeful message! The shlok says: It is Light that ushers in joy, health and prosperity into our lives, dispelling negative thought, bringing in positivity. I salute the divine flame respectfully. To make this Diwali memorable, what could be a better way than an attempt to let light spread its radiance, encouraging positivity, with a prayer to quell the feeling of animosity? These days Diwali is celebrated across many countries. And notably, it is not limited to Indian communities; even governments, citizens and social organisations wholeheartedly celebrate Diwali with gaiety and fervour. In a way, they nurture a microcosm of India at their respective places.

Friends, festival tourism has its own exciting attractions. Our India, the country of festivals, possesses limitless possibilities in the realm of festival tourism. It must be our endeavour to ensure that we should welcomingly include people of other states, other countries when we celebrate Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal or Bihu, spreading their true spirit. Here, every state, every region is replete with distinct festivals, generating a lot of interest in people from other countries. Hence, the Indian Diaspora has a significant role to play in promoting festival tourism in India .

My dear countrymen, in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something different this Diwali. I had urged all of you to celebrate India’s Nari-Shakti, the power and achievement of women, thereby felicitating the Lakshmi of India. And within no time, there followed a slew of innumerable inspirational stories on social media. Kodipaka Ramesh from Warangal has written on Namo App-“My mother is my strength. In 1990, when my father expired, the responsibility to raise five sons fell on her shoulders. Today, all five brothers are doing well in their respective professions. My mother is God to me. She is the Lakshmi of India in every sense of the term.” Ramesh ji , respectful greetings to your mother. Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for her, Major Khushbu Kanwar, daughter of a bus conductor, who has led an all women contingent of Assam Rifles, is the Lakshmi of India. For Kavita Tiwari, her daughter is the Lakshmi of India, her strength. She is proud of her daughter’s excellent painting ability. She has also secured a good rank in the CLAT exam. Whereas Megha Jain has mentioned that a 92 year old woman has been offering free drinking water to passengers at Gwalior Railway Station. Megha Ji is truly inspired by the humility and compassion of this Lakshmi of India. Many such stories have been shared by people. Do read them, get inspired and share similar instances. I respectfully salute all the Lakshmis of India.

My dear countrymen, the well known 17th century poetess Sanchi Honnamma has penned a poem in Kannada that embodies the same thought, the same words pertaining to every Lakshmi of India that we referred to. One feels the foundation of the idea was laid in the 17th century itself. You will notice the beauty of word, sentiment and thought in this poem in Kannada:

(Penninda permegondanu himavantanu.

Penninda broohu perchidanu

Penninda janakaraayanu jasuvalendanu)   

 

Which means, Himwant, Lord Mount attained fame on account of daughter Parvati, Rishi Brighu on account of his daughter Lakshmi and King Janak because of daughter Sita. Our daughters are our pride…their prodigious virtuosity cradles our social fabric, ensuring its bright future.

My dear countrymen, the 12th of November, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakashotsav of Guru Nanak dev ji will be celebrated across the world. The luminescence of Guru Nanak Dev ji’s influence can be felt not only in India but around the world. Many of our Sikh brothers and sisters settled in other countries committedly follow Guru Nanak dev ji’s ideals. I can never forget my visits to Gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran. There is much about Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you, but it will require many an episode of Mann ki Baat. He accorded the highest significance to the spirit of service. Guru Nank Dev ji firmly believed that any service done selflessly was beyond evaluation. He stood firm against social ills such as untouchability. Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji radiated his message to all corners of the world. He was the widest travelled of those times. And wherever he went he won hearts through his straightforwardness, humility and simplicity. Guru Nanak Ji undertook many significant spiritual journeys called ‘Udaasi’. Carrying the message of harmony and equality, he travelled north, south, east and west, meeting people, saints and sages. It is said that the revered Assamese saint Shankar Dev too was inspired by him. He also travelled to the holy land of Haridwar. There is a holy place in Kashi named ‘Gurubagh Gurudwara’. It is believed that Guru Nanak Dev Ji had halted there. He also went to Buddhist holy sites such as Rajgir and Gaya. His journeys to the south took him to Sri Lanka, as well. During his Yatra to Bidar, Karnataka, he devised a solution for water woes the place was grappling with.  Gurunanak Jhira Sahib is a famous place in Bidar dedicated to him, cherishing reminiscences of him. During one Udaasi, Gurunanak Dev Ji travelled north to Kashmir and neighboring areas. This forged a strong bond between Sikh followers and Kashmir. Guru Nanak Dev Ji also went to Tibet where people accorded him the status of a Guru. He is revered in Uzbekistan too, which he had visited. During one Udaasi, he widely travelled to Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan. He secured a revered place in the hearts of millions who followed his messages with complete devotion, a practice that continues even in the present times. Just a few days ago, Ambassadors of approximately eighty-five countries went to Amritsar from Delhi. There in the Golden Temple itself, they undertook a holy Darshan, commemorating the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji. Besides Darshan, all these Ambassadors had the opportunity to know more about Sikh traditions and culture. Following that, many Ambassadors shared those photos on social media, writing about their glorious experiences.It's my devout wish to imbibe Guru Nanak Dev Ji's thoughts and ideals into our lives; may we be all the more inspired to make it happen.

My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure all of you remember the significance of the 31st of October. This day marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the unifying force in bonding us as a Nation; our Hero.On the one hand Sardar Patel, possessed the rare quality of uniting people; on the other, he was able to strike a balance with people who were not  in ideological agreement with him. Sardar Patel used to observe even the minutest of things in-depth; assessing and evaluating them simultaneously.

He was a 'Man of Detail' in the true sense of the term. Along with that, he was also adept at organising skills. Chalking out plans and devising strategies was his core forte'. When we read and hear about Sardar Saheb's style of working, we come to know of the sheer magnitude of the meticulousness in his planning. In 1921, in the Congress Session in Ahmedabad, thousands of delegates from across the country were slated to participate. Sardar Patel was entrusted with overlooking all the arrangements. He utilized this opportunity in improving the city’s water supply network. He ensured that not a single person would face a problem on account of water. Not just that, he was also concerned about the safety and security of the delegates’ shoes and baggage. To ensure that, what he did will surprise you.He contacted farmers and urged them to craft khadi bags. These were made and sold to the delegates. They carried the bags with their shoes inside, free from any tension of the footwear getting stolen. On the other hand, it led to a major rise in the sale of khadi. Our country will always be indebted to Sardar Patel for his steller role in the Constituent Assembly. He strove to ensure enshrinement of fundamental rights that obliterated any possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste and community.

 

Friends, all of us know that as India’s first home minister, Sardar Patel undertook the colossal, historic task of integrating Princely states. Scrutinizing the minutest of events closely was his rare quality. On the one hand, he concentrated on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other States; on the other, he was watching far flung Lakshadweep intently. Actually, when we refer to Sardar Patel’s endeavour, his role in the unification of just a few notable States is discussed. He played a far more significant role, when it came to a small region such as Lakshadweep too. Lakshadweep is one of the most beautiful landscapes in India. Soon after Partition in 1947, our neighbour had cast an eye on Lakshadweep; a ship bearing their flag was sent there. When Sardar Patel was informed of this, he wasted no time in initiating stern action. He urged the Mudaliar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxman Swamy Mudaliar  to immediately undertake a mission with people of Travancore to Lakshadweep and take the lead in unfurling the Tricolour there. Following his orders, the Tricolour was promptly unfurled there and the nefarious dreams of the neighbour of annexing Lakshadweep were decimated within no time. After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure all assistance for development of Lakshadweep. Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly in India’s progress. It is an attractive tourist destination too. I hope you get the opportunity to visit the picturesque islands and its pristine beaches.

My dear countrymen, the 31st of October, 2018, is the day when the 'Statue of Unity',in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world. It is the tallest statue in the world. It is double in height compared to the 'Statue of Liberty' located in the US. The distinction of having the world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride; the head of every Indian is held high. You will be happy to note that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists visited the 'Statue of Unity'. This means that an average of eight and a half thousand people witnessed the grandeur of the 'Statue of Unity' every day. The reverence and devotion for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in their hearts was reflected in the form of homage paid to him. Besides, at present,it houses many centres of attraction such as Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Jungle Safari, and Children’s Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery, which are all constantly evolving and providing a fillip to the local economy. Local people are not only getting innovative opportunities of employment but for the convenience of visiting tourists, many villagers are providing facilities like home stays. And these hosts are being professionally trained in the technique of running a home stay.  The locals have now started the cultivation of Dragon fruit and I am sure that it will soon become a major source of livelihood for the people there.

Friends, for our nation and the constituent states, as well as for the tourism industry, this 'Statue of Unity' can be a subject of research. We are all witness to the fact that how within a year a place developed as a world famous tourism destination. People arrive there from the country and abroad. And one after the other, ancillary services like transport, lodging, guides and eco-friendly services are getting inducted by themselves. A large economy is developing and people are generating facilities as per the requirement of the tourists. The government is also playing its role. Friends, which Indian will not be imbued with pride for the fact that recently, Time magazine has included the ‘Statue of Unity’in its list of 100 important tourist destinations around the world. Of course I hope, that all of you will devote some of your precious time to visit the ‘Statue of Unity’.  But my appeal is, that every Indian who takes out time to travel must visit at least 15 Tourist Destinations of India with family and experience a night stay at whichever place you go to; this still remains my appeal.

 

Friends, as you know that 31st October every year since 2014 has been celebrated as 'National Unity Day'. This day imparts the message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost. On 31st October, this year too ‘Run for Unity’ is being organized in consonance with previous years. It will include people from all walks of life, from every segment of our society. ‘Run for Unity’ is a symbol of unison, that the nation being united, is moving in one direction and collectively aims for- One goal! Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat!

The last five years have witnessed - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, union territories, state capitals, district centres, even in small cities belonging to tier two or tier three categories, innumerable men, women, be they the city folk,  village folk, children, the youth, the elderly, divyang, all are participating in‘Run for Unity’in large numbers. Anyway, at present, people have adopted and found a passion for the marathon. ‘Run for Unity’ is also one such unique provision. Running is beneficial for the mind, body and soul. During ‘Run for Unity’not only do we have to run, but in doing so the spirit of FIT India is also reflected. We also find ourselves connected with Ek Bharat- Shrestha Bharat! And so, not just our body, but our mind and value system get integrated with ushering unity in India to take India to loftier heights! And so, in whichever city you reside, you can find out about the ‘Run for Unity’ schedule. A portal namely runforunity.gov.in has also been launched for dissemination of information about this event. In this portal, information has been provided about the venues where ‘Run for Unity’ is to be organized across the country. I hope you will all run on October 31st –not only for the unity of India, but also for your physical fitness!

 

My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the nation with the thread of unison. This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our life and in a country like ours filled with diversities, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unison on all paths, at every bend, and at every pit-stop. My dear countrymen, our nation has always been very proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the country. If we look around us, we will find many examples of individuals who have been working ceaselessly to foster communal harmony. But sometimes it so happens, that the efforts of the society and its contribution, get wiped from our collective memory.

 

Friends, I remember when the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi in September 2010. You could jog your memory a bit and reflect about the atmosphere then. Various kinds of people took to the arena! Various interest groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation in their own way! The kind of language that was spoken in order to generate tension in the atmosphere! There was also an attempt to instill shrillness in the tone of different speakers. Some of the loudmouths and the braggarts had the sole intention of hogging the spotlight at that time. And we all know what kind of irresponsible talk was floating around! But this scenario had continued for five days, or seven days, or ten days, but, the delivery of the court’s decision generated a pleasant and surprising change of mood in the country.

 

On the one hand, the machinations went on to generate tension for  week or two, but, when the decision was taken on Ram Janmabhoomi, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all sects and saints gave restrained and balanced statements. There were attempts to reduce the tension in the sociopolitical environment. But I remember that day vividly. And whenever I do that, I get happy that the dignity of the judiciary was very proudly honoured and no allowance for any heated discourse or tension was made anywhere. These incidents should always be remembered as they impart us a lot of strength. That day, that moment, instills in us all a sense of duty. It is an example of how the voice of unison can bestow strength upon our country.

 

My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the same day… the former Prime Minister of our country Smt Indira ji was assasinated. It was a traumatic moment for our country. Today, I pay homage to her too.

My dear countrymen, today, if one story that rings from home to home, and rings far and wide,is heard from north to south, east to west and from every corner of India, then that IS the story of cleanliness and sanitation. Every person, every family, every village wants to narrate their pleasant experiences in relation to the cleanliness mission, because behind this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 125 crore Indians.

The outcome also belongs to 125 crore Indians. But therein lies a pleasant and interesting experience too. I heard it and I think, I will share it with you too. Just imagine the highest battlefield in the world, where the temperature drops from zero to 50-60 degrees minus. Oxygen in the air is also at a miniscule level. Living in the midst of such adverse conditions and challenges is not less than any display of valour. In such a difficult situation, our brave heart soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country, but are also running a ‘Swacch Siachen’ campaign in that arena.

On behalf of our countrymen, I commend the Indian Army for this amazing commitment. I also express my gratitude. It is so cold there that its near impossible for anything to decompose. In such a situation, the segregation and management of garbage is a very important task in itself. In this scenario, to remove 130 tons and more of garbage from the glacier and its surrounding area’s fragile eco-system is a great service! It is an eco-system which is home to rare species like the snow leopard and rare animals like ibex and brown bears. We all know that Siachen as a glacier is a source of rivers and clean water. Therefore, running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those who live in low-lying areas and also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok.

My dear countrymen, festivals are occasions that awaken a new consciousness in our lives. And especially during Diwali, it is customary in every family to buy something new, get something from the market in smaller or larger quantity. I had once said that we should try to buy local products. There is no need to go to the tehsil if our need is met in our village. If it is found in Tehsil, then there is no need to go to the district. The more we try to buy our local things; the 'Gandhi 150' will become a great event in itself. And I keep insisting that we must buy some handloom products made by our weavers, our khadi artisans.

Even during this Diwali, you must have bought quite a few or a lot of things before Diwali. But there are many people who think that if they go shopping after Diwali then may be they could get a good bargain. So there will be many people, who still have their shopping left. Hence along with the best of wishes on Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward and become a patron of local things and buy local. And witness for ourselves, how we can play an important role in making Mahatma Gandhi's dream come alive. I once again wish you all the very best on this auspicious festival of Diwali. In Diwali we burst fire crackers of all kinds! But, sometimes fire is caused due to carelessness. An injury can also occur. I urge all of you to take utmost care of yourself and also celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm. I extend many felicitations to you.

Thank you very much.

                The exhibition cum e-auctioning of mementos received by Prime Minister drew to a close today on 24th October. The auction met with a tremendous response and tens of thousands of bids were received.  All proceeds from the e-auction will be donated towards funding the NamamiGange Mission.

The Union Culture Ministry organised the e-auction from 14th September to sell a total of 2772 mementos gifted to the Prime Minister. Items were kept on display at the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi. The mementos include diverse objects and memorabilia including paintings, sculptures, shawls, jackets and traditional musical instruments.

Initially, the e-auction was supposed to be held till 3rd October. However, in face of a tremendous public response and a request for more people to participate, a decision was taken to extend the auction process for another three weeks. As of today, all items on auction stand sold-out. Celebrities, politicians and activists have shown interest in the auction, with many like Bollywood stars Anil Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, and singer Kailash Kher endorsing it.

Amongst the mementos on display, the lowest base price was kept at Rs 500 for items like small statue of Lord Ganesha and decorative wooden box in lotus shape. The highest base price of Rs. 2.5 lakhs was reserved for an acrylic painting with a tri-colour background of Prime Minister with Mahatma Gandhi, which has received a final bid of Rs. 25 lakhs. 

A framed photograph of the Prime Minister receiving blessings from his mother, with a base price of Rs. 1000, has received a bid of Rs. 20 lakhs.  Other popular auction items include an exhibit of Manipuri Folk Arts (an original base price of Rs. 50,000, sold for a bid of Rs. 10 lakhs), a metallic sculpture of a cow feeding a calf (a base price of Rs. 4,000, sold for a bid of Rs. 10 lakhs) and a metallic 14 cm statue of Swami Vivekanand (base price of Rs. 4,000 that has received a final price of Rs. 6 lakhs).

                PM met with the JP Morgan International Council in New Delhi today. After 2007, this was the first time that the International Council met in India. 

The International Council comprises of global statesmen like former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, former Australian PM John Howard, former US Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates as well as leading figures from the world of business and finance like Jamie Dimon (JP Morgan Chase), Ratan Tata (Tata Group) and leading representatives from global companies like Nestle, Alibaba, Alfa, Iberdola, Kraft Heinz etc.

While welcoming the group to India, Prime Minister discussed his vision for making India a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024. Prime Minister said that the development of world class physical infrastructure and improvements in affordable health-care and providing quality education were some other policy priorities for the Government.

People’s Participation remained a guiding tenet of policy making for the Government. On foreign policy front, India continued to work together with its strategic partners and close neighbors to build a fair and equitable multipolar world order.

                Ratan Tata ji, who has always inspired and energized the country's social and business leadership, N. Chandrasekaran ji who has been carrying his legacy forward, Rupa ji and  ladies and gentlemen!!

 

Meeting Ratan Tata ji and Chandrasekaran ji and talking to them always gives a new experience. They have the responsibility of giving leadership to one of the largest institutions of the country.

 

Despite such a huge responsibility, I wonder how they manage to smile and be stress free! I think Chandrashekaran ji should write a book on this aspect in the future. And yes, I do not claim to have any patent for this Idea. You can do this without any stress!!!

 

Friends,

 

I cannot say whether he will write a book or not, but the result of what happens with Smile and Stress free Mind, is in front of us as 'Bridgital Nation'.

 

 Positivity, creativity and a constructive mindset can result in new ideas to solve the problems of the country. 

 

This positivity, optimism and belief in our talent and resources are the thinking of the new India.

 

I believe that this book will not only inspire Aspirational India, but will also encourage some professional pessimists of the society to adopt a new approach and a new outlook. I congratulate Chandrasekharan ji and Rupa ji for this visionary document.

 

Friends,

 

This book has come at a time when a huge effort is being made to demonize technology. An attempt is being made to create an atmosphere of fear.

 

Particularly in context of India, technology is being represented as a challenge to our Demographic Dividend.

 

In this book, the vision of the government is further strengthened, according to which technology is shown as a medium of connection instead of creating disruptions.

 

Technology is a bridge, not a divider.

 

Technology and talent are force multipliers, not threat.

 

Technology is the bridge between Aspiration and Achievements.

 

Technology is the bridge between Demand and Delivery.

 

Technology is the bridge between Government and Governance.

 

Technology is a bridge connecting everyone with development.

 

Friends,

 

This sentiment has been present during our last five years’ tenure and this is our approach to the future.

 

This book describes how modern technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Robotics are going to work as an aid or as a tool for development.

 

I can say the same thing based on my experiences. You are able to realize how Technological interventions have reformed and transformed governance in India in the last 5 years. I will give you an example of how all of this is happening.

 

Friends,

 

The scheme to provide LPG gas connection and subsidies has been going on for decades in our country.

 

When we launched the Ujjwala scheme, many people thought that probably this too would follow a similar pattern as before. But we also changed the idea behind it; we changed the approach and introduced technology in it.

 

Friends,

 

If we had followed the previous approach, then a committee would have been formed that would sit and talk to different stake holders and we could have never met the deadline. But instead of the committee, we relied on technology approach.

 

With the help of Data Intelligence, we first located 17 thousand existing LPG distribution centers and then created 10 thousand new centers in a very short time. We digitally mapped every village in the country for the same.

 

This data was analyzed for other data points, such as sale report, LPG penetration, population and socio-economic conditions.

 

Based on the analysis of about 64 lakh diverse data points from lakhs of villages, the location of the distribution centres to be built was decided. But our work did not end here. There was another major problem which was solved by technology.

 

During the real time monitoring of applications and distribution on the dashboard, it was found that the applications of several women were getting rejected because they did not have a bank account.

 

 

Jan Dhan Camps were organized to deal with this problem and bank accounts of such women were opened.

 

As a result, the target we had set for giving 8 crore connections in 3 years was achieved long before the deadline.

 

Friends,

 

It was a matter of increasing access to technology. Now let me give you an example of what role technology plays in bringing behavioral change through Access. Your book has thrown light on the state of healthcare in the country. In particular, the mental block of not getting treated in our country due to poverty and lack of money.

 

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is playing a major role towards changing this situation. Previously, the poor who used to shy away from getting treatment in the worry that everything had to be sold have started reaching the hospital. The poor people, who have been hesitant to even knock the doors of private hospitals, are now getting access there.

 

Today the situation is such that there has been a behavioral change among the poor; demand for medical services has also increased; the poor people are also being treated and the hospitals are also getting money from the government. This has been possible only due to technology.

 

Friends

 

With technology, we are developing Ayushman Bharat as a complete package of healthcare.

 

Earlier there was no focus on Preventive Healthcare. Primary Healthcare was limited to just headaches and stomach aches and Tertiary Healthcare was on a completely different track.

 

Now 1.5 lakh health and wellness centers are being set up in the country and they are being developed as a base of Tertiary Healthcare.

 

In a very short time, more than 21 thousand such centers have also been set up so far.

 

You will be surprised that in such a short time, more than 1.5 crore people have been diagnosed with hyper-tension, more than 1.25 crore with diabetes, and more than 1.5 crore with cancer at these centers.

 

Earlier this was not possible in Primary Healthcare Centers. Now these cases are being referred further from these Health and Wellness Centers and based on that data direct and quick treatment is now possible in the Tertiary Healthcare Network.

 

Friends,

 

We also get the solution for Transparency and Targeted Delivery when technology becomes a bridge. You are well aware of the role of middlemen and brokers in India.

 

The phrase ’Governments run the country; Middle-men run the governance,' was accepted as a rule. This was because there was a gap between the people and the process. The ordinary citizen was crushed by the long system of Certification right from birth to death.

 

Today hundreds of government services ranging from birth to life certificates are online. Today Self Certification is becoming the norm in the country. Now we are moving towards systems like Self Assessment, Self Declaration and Faceless Tax Assessment.

 

Friends,

 

Another example of how the effective use of technology transforms challenges into opportunities is India Post Payment Bank, India's largest network. Our Post Office service was in danger of being shut down due to the increasing proliferation of mobile and internet. Jobs of lakhs of people were under threat.

 

But today due to technology, Post Offices are becoming home delivery centers for Banking Services and digital transaction.

 

Similarly, Common Service Center network providing online service delivery in villages is providing employment to more than 12 lakh youth.

 

Friends,

 

I also broadly agree with the suggestions given in the book to strengthen the Enterprise spirit and the MSMEs and to make them important centers of job creation. We are also making extensive use of technology to remove silos here.

 

You know about the Government e-Market place i.e. GeM for Public Procurement. It is a bridge between the government's demand and MSME's supply eco-system.

 

The success of this system can be gauged from the fact that this year there is a purchasing target of 50,000 crore rupees through it.

 

Friends

 

Similarly, Start-Up India is bridging local demand and supply, while Make in India is bridging local supply and global demand.

 

In this book you have explained about the problems in demand and supply very minutely. Start-Up India is also dealing with the same problems.

 

Keeping in mind the challenges in India, it is an attempt to transform the industry by incubating the ideas. This is the reason why more start-ups are coming up in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities today.

 

Friends,

 

Amidst all these things, it is also true that technology is not the only solution. Human Intention and Right Intention is very important. The same applies to Artificial Intelligence as well. Debate should not be on 'what is the danger from Artificial Intelligence?' or 'How long would it take for a robot to become smarter than humans?'

 

Rather the debate should be on, 'how do we create a bridge between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intentions?' and ’how to upgrade our skills according to new demand?'

 

Let AI be just another aid which is a little more sophisticated.

 

There is a lot to say but I have to give other people time to read the book. Once again, many congratulations and best wishes for this great book and great effort.

 

Thank you!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today unveiled the book “Bridgital Nation” and presented its first copy to Shri Ratan Tata in an event organized at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, New Delhi today. The book has been written by Shri N Chandrasekaran and Ms. Roopa Purushottam.

Technology: The bridge to achieve ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’

Addressing the gathering, PM lauded the authors for bringing out a visionary book that is replete with positivity and optimism and delves in depth about the importance of technology. He added that the book is coming out at a time when technology is positively transforming the lives of millions of Indians.

Prime Minister stressed on the need to understand that technology is a bridge and not a divider. He added that technology builds bridge between aspirations and achievement, demand and delivery, government and governance in order to achieve ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’. He said that positivity, creativity and constructive mind-set is essential for fast growing aspirational India. He also emphasized on the need to build bridge between artificial intelligence and human intentions .

Governance through technology: The journey of last five years

Prime Minister narrated how technology has been a key component of government schemes in order to reform, transform and perform. He mentioned about the use of data intelligence, digital mapping and real time monitoring in Ujjwala Yojana which has transformed the lives of millions of women. He also talked about how technology has helped in empowering people through schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana and Ayushman Bharat.

Prime Minister also outlined that his government has used technology to remove silos amongst government departments and build a bridge between supply systems and demand, through innovative ideas like Government e-market Place (GeM). He explained how technology was used to create a robust Start-Up system in the country, especially in tier-2 and tier 3 cities - which has helped in the development of an entirely new ecosystem of startups. 

Talking about the need to convert challenges posed by technology into opportunities, PM cited the example of the creation of India Post Payment Bank. He added that the disruption caused by technology to the entire postal organization was converted into a technology intensive banking system, benefitting millions through postal bank which transformed ‘dakiya into a Bank Babu’. 

Diplomatic Corp, Government representatives & Media Personalities attend

The event witnessed participation of members of the diplomatic corps, including the Ambassadors of USA, Great Britain and the People's Republic of China. Secretaries of several Ministries of Government of India; representatives of industry bodies including CII, FICCI and NASSCOM; leading media personalities including Rajat Sharma, Navika Kumar, Rajkamal Jha, Sudhir Chaudhary, Smita Prakash; and members of the Tata Group were also present.

About the Book

The book presents a powerful vision of the future where technology and human beings co-exist in a mutually beneficial ecosystem. It argues that instead of accepting technology as replacement of human labour, India can use it as an aid to generate more jobs. The cutting edge digital tools can act as a bridge between aspirations and achievements - hence the term ‘bridgital’.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was at Mamallapuram, Chennai to head the 2nd India-China Informal Summit said the morning stroll along the beaches of Bay of Bengal had made him emotional and inspired him to pen a poem on the Sea and its virtues.

Titled Hey Sagar Tumhe Pranam, the poem details Prime Minister’s personal emotional connect with the Sea.

In a tweet on his personal handle @narendramodi the Prime Minister shared his poem with the public.

कल महाबलीपुरम में सवेरे तट पर टहलते-टहलते सागर से संवाद करने में खो गया। ये संवाद मेरा भाव-विश्व है। इस संवाद भाव को शब्दबद्ध करके आपसे साझा कर रहा हूं- pic.twitter.com/JKjCAcClws— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 13, 2019

                Former Prime Minister Shri H.D. Deve Gowda praised the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for the making of the world’s tallest statue of Sardar Vallabhai Patel in Gujarat. He also recalled that Ahmedabad airport was renamed as Sardar Vallabhai Patel International airport and Sardar Vallabhai Patel memorial was built in his home town in Nadiad, Gujarat in the past. These have been brought to a logical end by the construction of world’s tallest statue for the Iron Man of India. He also added that it had been made more attractive and indigenous and that is why people across the globe are visiting these places and enjoying the beauty of both the ‘Statue of Unity’ as well as ‘Sardar Sarovar Dam’. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has expressed happiness after former Prime Minister Shri H.D. Deve Gowda visited the Statue of Unity.

                1. The Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi and the President of the People's Republic of China Mr Xi Jinping held their Second Informal Summit in Chennai, India, on 11-12 October 2019.

2. The two Leaders had an in-depth exchange of views in a friendly atmosphere on overarching, long-term and strategic issues of global and regional importance.

3. They also shared their respective approaches towards national development.

4. They evaluated the direction of bilateral relations in a positive light and discussed how India-China bilateral interaction can be deepened to reflect the growing role of both countries on the global stage.

5. Both Leaders shared the view that the international situation is witnessing significant readjustment. They were of the view that India and China share the common objective of working for a peaceful, secure and prosperous world in which all countries can pursue their development within a rules-based international order.

6. They reiterated the consensus reached during the first Informal Summit in Wuhan, China in April 2018, that India and China are factors for stability in the current international landscape and that both side will prudently manage their differences and not allow differences on any issue to become disputes.

7. The Leaders recognized that India and China have a common interest in preserving and advancing a rules-based and inclusive international order, including through reforms that reflect the new realities of the 21st Century. Both agreed that it is important to support and strengthen the rules-based multilateral trading system at a time when globally agreed trade practices and norms are being selectively questioned. India and China will continue to work together for open and inclusive trade arrangements that will benefit all countries.

8. Both Leaders also underscored the important efforts being made in their respective countries to address global developmental challenges, including climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals. They emphasized that their individual efforts in this regard would help the international community achieve the targets.

9. Both Leaders are concerned that terrorism continues to pose a common threat. As countries that are large and diverse, they recognized the importance of continuing to make joint efforts to ensure that the international community strengthens the framework against training, financing and supporting terrorist groups throughout the world and on a non-discriminatory basis.

10. As important contemporary civilizations with great traditions, both Leaders deemed it important to enhance dialogue in order to foster cultural understanding between the two peoples. Both Leaders also agreed that, as major civilizations in history, they can work together to enhance greater dialogue and understanding between cultures and civilizations in other parts of the world.

11. They shared the view that an open, inclusive, prosperous and stable environment in the region is important to ensure the prosperity and stability of the region. They also agreed on the importance of concluding negotiations for a mutually-beneficial and balanced Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

12. The two Leaders exchanged views on the age-old commercial linkages and people-to-people contacts between India and China in the past two millennia, including significant maritime contacts. In this regard the two leaders agreed on establishment of sister-state relations between Tamil Nadu and Fujian Province, exploring the possibility of establishing an academy to study links between Mahabalipuram and Fujian province on the lines of the experience between Ajanta and Dunhuang and conducting research on maritime links between China and India in view of our extensive contacts over the centuries.

13. The two Leaders shared their mutual vision on goals for development of their respective economies. They agreed that the simultaneous development of India and China presents mutually-beneficial opportunities. The two sides will continue to adopt a positive, pragmatic and open attitude and to enhance appreciation of each other’s policies and actions in line with the general direction of their friendship and cooperation. In this regard, they also agreed to continue to enhance strategic communication on all matters of mutual interest, and to continue the momentum of high-level exchanges by making full use of dialogue mechanisms.

14. The leaders were of the view that the positive direction of ties had opened up possibilities for taking bilateral relations to greater heights. They agreed that this endeavor also required strong public support in both countries. In this context the two Leaders have decided to designate 2020 as Year of India-China Cultural and People to People Exchanges and agreed that the 70th anniversary of the establishment of India-China relations in 2020 will be fully utilized to deepen exchanges at all levels including between their respective legislatures, political parties, cultural and youth organizations and militaries. To celebrate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations the two countries will organize 70 activities including a conference on a ship voyage that will trace the historical connect between the two civilizations.

15. In pursuit of their efforts to further deepen economic cooperation and to enhance their closer development partnership, the two Leaders have decided to establish a High-Level Economic and Trade Dialogue mechanism with the objective of achieving enhanced trade and commercial relations, as well as to better balance the trade between the two countries. They have also agreed to encourage mutual investments in identified sectors through the development of a Manufacturing Partnership and tasked their officials to develop this idea at the first meeting of the High-Level Economic and Trade Dialogue.

16. The two Leaders have exchanged views on outstanding issues, including on the boundary question. They have welcomed the work of the Special Representatives and urged them to continue their efforts to arrive at a mutually-agreed framework for a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable settlement based on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles that were agreed by the two sides in 2005. They reiterated their understanding that efforts will continue to be made to ensure peace and tranquility in the border areas, and that both sides will continue to work on additional Confidence Building Measures in pursuit of this objective.

17. Prime Minister Modi and President Xi also appraised the practice of Informal Summits in a positive light as providing an important opportunity to deepen dialogue and to promote mutual understanding at the Leaders’ level in line with the ‘Wuhan Spirit’ and the ‘Chennai Connect”. They agreed to continue this practice in the future. President Xi invited Prime Minister Modi to visit China for the 3rd Informal Summit. Prime Minister Modi has accepted the invitation.

His sacrifice and dedication are always memorable”

 

मां भारती के सच्चे सपूत लोकनायक जयप्रकाश नारायण को उनकी जन्म-जयंती पर विनम्र श्रद्धांजलि। उन्होंने स्वतंत्रता संघर्ष में अपना बहुमूल्य योगदान तो दिया ही, आजादी के बाद लोकतंत्र की रक्षा में भी अतुलनीय भूमिका निभाई। उनका त्याग और समर्पण हम सबके लिए सदा प्रेरणास्रोत रहेगा। pic.twitter.com/MVZ068OcPD— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 11, 2019

                126 IPS probationers of 2018 batch called on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in New Delhi today.

Interacting with the probationers, Prime Minister enthused the young officers to work tirelessly with dedication for the betterment of our nation. 

Prime Minister asked the officers to imbibe service orientation and dedication in their day to day work. He stressed on the importance for the police force to be connected with ordinary citizens. He said that each officer should understand citizen’s perspective about the police force and work towards making the police force citizen friendly and approachable.



In an interactive session with the IPS Probationers, Prime Minister said that the role of police should be focussed on crime prevention. He highlighted the importance of technology in creating a modern police force.

Prime Minister also discussed about the role of police in transforming aspirational districts and as instruments of social change. He lauded the large number of women probationers in the 2018 batch. More number of women in police force will have a huge positive impact in policing as well as nation building, PM added.

Wishing the officers a bright future, Prime Minister asked the officers to believe in themselves. He added that self-confidence and inherent strength along with the official training will equip the officers to deal with day to day challenges.

Jai Shri Ram! Jai Shri Ram!

Jai Shri Ram! Jai Shri Ram!

My dear culture-lover brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers! Best wishes to all of you on the auspicious festival of Vijayadashami.

India is a land of festivals. There is hardly a day in 365 days when a festival is not celebrated in any corner of India.

Due to thousands of years of cultural tradition, our life has been associated with many heroic mythological stories and this heritage has given us a strong cultural history. Our country has also made festivals a way of constant rejuvenation of culture, education and collective social life.

The festivals connect us; the festivals also inspire us. Festivals fill us with enthusiasm and also give us the ability to have new dreams. Festivities are present in our blood, so festivals are the soul of India's social life. And because of this festive element, this thousand-year-old great tradition never had to change into a club culture. Festivals are the best medium of expressing one's emotions and this is the power of festivals.

During festivals, there has been a continuous effort to refine talent, to give talent a social dignity and to showcase talent. Be it art, be it musical instruments, song or dance; all forms of art are inextricably linked to our festivals. And this is the reason why due to thousands of years of cultural heritage, due to the presence of art in our lives through festivals, we have humans in true sense in our society and not the robots. Humanity, emotions, compassion and kindness are constantly being rejuvenated through festivals.

And so, in these nine days of Navratri, there will be no corner in India where the festival of Navratri will not be celebrated. The festival of Shakti Sadhana, the festival of Shakti worship reduces the shortcomings and insecurities of the inner self. This power is worshipped in a new form by transmitting new power from within.

 

In this country that worships mother, in this country that worships Shakti, it is the responsibility of all the people and all the citizens to safeguard the honor, pride and dignity of every mother and daughter in this land.

And so this time in the 'Mann ki Baat' episode I had said that the festivals in our country had been changing according to the era. We are a society that proudly accepts change. We are also the ones who accept challenges and also throw challenges and we are the people who can change themselves as per the need.

Changes should be brought when there is still time.  When someone asks how come we continue to thrive; what is the reason? That is because when there is an evil in our society, then Great men are also born within our society to fight against those evils. When that person of our society goes out to fight against the evils prevailing in the society, initially there is a conflict, but later the same man becomes a venerable ascetic teacher and an inspiration to the society.

And so we are the people who are constantly accepting change. And as people are accepting change, I had said this time in the 'Mann ki Baat' episode that on the festival of Diwali we worship Mahalakshmi. We welcome Lakshmi with a great fervent. We have a dream wherein goddess Lakshmi stays with us in our house till the next Diwali or next year. We want Lakshmi to continue to be with us.

 

I had said in the 'Mann ki Baat' episode that in a country where Lakshmi is worshipped, and Lakshmi is also present in our houses, villages, our neighborhoods, there our daughters are considered as a form of Lakshmi. The daughters in our villages, neighborhood, in our wards, cities who have achieved something in their lives and can inspire others must be honoured on this Diwali through public events, and that should be our Lakshmi Pujan; that is the goal of our country. And so with the passage of time, we have also accepted changes in our festivals.

Today we are observing the sacred festival of Vijayadashami and this day also marks the birthday of our Air Force. The Air Force of our country is attaining new heights. On this occasion of the auspicious festival of Vijayadashami as we pray to Lord Hanuman, let us also give a thought to the Air Force in particular and all our brave soldiers of our Air Force and wish them all the best, and give our best wishes for their bright future.

Today is the festival of Vijayadashami, the festival of victory of divine power over demonical power, i.e. the festival of victory.   It is equally important to defeat the demonic power within us every moment till there is time and only then can we realize Lord Rama. And so in order to feel Lord Rama and to be successful in our lives we must empower our intrinsic energy and inner power by destroying our inner weaknesses. Our first responsibility is to destroy the devil within.

Today, on the occasion of Vijayadashami and as we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, all the countrymen should resolve -

We will fulfil at least one resolution for the betterment of the country this year, so that the country will be served by some or the other person. If I save water, that too can be a resolution. I will never waste food - can also be a resolution. I will save electricity - can also be a resolution. I will never allow damage to public property of the country - can also be a resolution.

We get a few auspicious occasions that are coincidental like the festival of Vijayadashami, or the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Using this coincidence, while seeking inspiration from that, we should also make a resolution in our life, and we will certainly emerge victorious.

What is the power of unified efforts? The power of collective efforts is manifested if we think of Lord Krishna. He had raised the Govardhan Mountain on one finger, but he was joined by all the Shepherds in lifting it with the collective strength of their sticks.

Look at the life of Lord Rama! He had to cross the sea and build a bridge. It also depicts collective power, by taking along the companions who he had met in the jungles. Lord Rama had built the bridge through collective efforts and had reached Lanka too. This potential lies in collectivity. These festivals enrich the power of concerted efforts. Let us also fulfil all our resolutions with that strength.

Let us make a personal effort to get rid of plastic. Let us add our villages, streets, neighborhoods to this campaign and run it as a movement - no first use plastic. Taking this kind of an idea forward, we should have our own resolution of getting rid of single use plastic.

For thousands of years, we have been celebrating this festival of victory of Lord Ram as 'Vijay Parv'. Efforts are being made to uphold the values by staging the Ramayana. This cultural tradition has been going on from generation to generation.

Today, I also congratulate Dwarka Ramlila Committee for their efforts to introduce our cultural heritage to the younger generation through this performance.

I wish you all the best on the occasion of Vijayadashami. And say aloud with me again-

 

Jai Shri Ram -  Jai Shri Ram!

Jai Shri Ram -  Jai Shri Ram!

Jai Shri Ram -  Jai Shri Ram!

Thanks a lot.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi attended Dussehra Celebrations at DDA Ground, Dwaraka in New Delhi, today. Prime Minister greeted fellow Indians on Vijaya Dashami. 

Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister said that India is a land of festivals. Due to our vibrant culture, there is always an occasion or festival in some parts of India. Through India’s festivals we celebrate the salient aspects of Indian culture. We get to know different types of art, music, song and dance, he added.

He said that India is a land of Shakti Sadhna. In the last nine days we worshipped Maa. Taking that spirit ahead, he called for working towards furthering empowerment as well as dignity of women.

Reminding about his talk on Ghar ki Laxmi during Maan ki Baat, Prime Minister called for celebrating the accomplishments of our Nari Shakti this Diwali. He said that today is Vijaya Dashami and also Air Force Day. India is phenomenally proud of our Air Force, he added.

At a time when we mark 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi, PM made a request on this Vijaya Dashami. He asked the people to take up one mission this year and work to fulfil it. This mission can be - not wasting food, conserving energy, saving water. He said that if we want to understand the power of collective spirit, we must seek inspiration from Bhagwan Shri Krishna and Bhagwan Shri Ram.

The Prime Minister watched the Ramleela organized by the Dwarka Sri Ram Leela Society. He also witnessed the burning of giant effigies of Ravan, Kumbhakarn and Meghnad signifying the triumph of good over evil, during the event.

                Your excellency, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
Excellencies,

Friends,
Namaskar!!
Sabaaike Sharodeeyo Shubhechha!

I am happy that for the opportunity to inaugurate three more bilateral projects with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Ji. In the past one year, we have launched 9 projects through video links. Adding the three projects of today, we have launched a dozen joint projects in a year. I congratulate the officials and citizens of both countries on this achievement.

Today's three projects are in three different areas: - LPG import, vocational training and social facility. But the purpose of all three is the same. And that is - to improve the lives of our citizens. This is also the main principle of India-Bangladesh relations. The basis of the India-Bangladesh partnership is that our friendship ensures the development of every citizen of ours.

The supply of bulk LPG from Bangladesh will benefit both countries. This will also increase exports, income and employment in Bangladesh. Reduction of 1500 km transportation distance will also result in economic benefits and reduced damage to the environment. The second project- Bangladesh-India Professional Skill Development Institute will prepare skilled manpower and technicians for the industrial development of Bangladesh.

Excellencies,

Last but not the least, the project of Vivekananda Bhavan at the Ramakrishna Mission in Dhaka, which takes inspiration from the lives of two great human beings, Swami Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Swami Vivekananda who have indelible influence on our societies and values.

Like the generosity and open spirit of Bangla culture, this mission also has a place for followers of all sects. And this mission celebrates the festival of every sect with equal fervor and vigor. The building has arrangements for accommodation of more than 100 university students and research scholars.

Excellency,

India prioritizes its partnership with Bangladesh. We are proud that India-Bangladesh relationship is a great example of cooperation between two friendly neighbors. I am glad that our interaction today will give more energy to our relationship.

Jai Hind! Jai Bangla! Jai Bharat-Bangla Bandhutva!

Thank you.

                Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius, the Honourable Mr. Pravind Jugnauth Ji, Senior Ministers and dignitaries of Mauritius, distinguished guests, Friends, Namaskar! Bonjour! Good afternoon!

I would like to extend a very warm greetings to all our friends in Mauritius.

This interaction is a special occasion for our nations. This is a new chapter in our shared history, heritage and cooperation. Not long ago, Mauritius hosted the Indian Ocean Island Games and achieved glory in them.

Both our countries are celebrating ‘Durga Puja’ and will soon celebrate Deepawali. These developments make the inauguration of the first phase of the Metro project an even more joyous occasion.  

The Metro will provide clean, efficient and time-saving transport. It will contribute to economic activities and tourism. 

The other project inaugurated today - state-of-the-art ENT Hospital - will contribute to quality healthcare. The Hospital has an energy efficient building and will offer paperless services. 

Both these projects will serve the people of Mauritius. They are a symbol of India’s strong commitment to the development of Mauritius.  

Thousands of workers have worked hard, day and night, in the sun and in rain, for these projects.  

But unlike in the past centuries, we today work for the better future of our people. 

I commend the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth who conceived modern infrastructure and services for Mauritius. I also sincerely thank him and the Government of Mauritius for their active cooperation, which has been the key to timely completion of these projects.

Friends,

We are proud that India has partnered Mauritius in these and other projects of direct public interest. 

Last year, a joint project provided e-tablets to young children. 

The new Supreme Court building and one thousand social housing units are coming up rapidly. 

I am happy to announce that India will support the construction of a renal unit as well as medi-clinics and Area Health Centres, suggested by Prime Minister Jugnauth. 

Friends, 

Both India and Mauritius are diverse and vibrant democracies, committed to working for the prosperity of our people, as well as for peace in our region and the world. 

Our mutual regard for each other finds expression in a number of ways.

This year, Prime Minister Jugnauth graced the largest ever Pravasi Bhartiya Divas as the Chief Guest, and also the inauguration of the second term of my government. 

Our President was invited as the Chief Guest on the 50th anniversary celebration of the independence of Mauritius. In the one hundred fiftieth year of Mahatma Gandhi, Mauritius pays homage to his abiding memory, and remembers its special bond with him.

Friends, 

The Indian Ocean is a bridge between India and Mauritius. Ocean economy holds great promise for our people. 

The vision of SAGAR – “Security and Growth for All in the Region” - will guide us to work closely together on all aspects of maritime economy, security and disaster risk reduction. 

I would like to thank the Government of Mauritius for joining the Coalition for Disaster resilient Infrastructure as a founding member. 

Excellency, 

In a month’s time, Aapravasi Diwas will be celebrated at the World Heritage Site of Aapravasi Ghat. It will mark the successful struggle of our brave ancestors. 

That struggle had borne rich fruits in the form of great success of Mauritius in this Century.

We salute the remarkable spirit of the people of Mauritius. 

Vive l'amitié antre l'Inde à Maurice. भारत और Mauritius मैत्री अमर रहे।             

Long live India-Mauritius friendship.

Thank You Thank You very much.

                Governor of Gujarat Acharya Devvrat ji, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani ji, other colleagues of the central and the state governments, representatives of the governments of Nigeria, Indonesia and Mali, Heads of Mission of the different countries of the world, thousands of Swachhagrahis from across the country, my Sarpanch friends and brothers and sisters!

Before I begin, through all the Sarpanchs present here on the bank of Sabarmati today, I want to salute all the governing members of the Municipalities and Municipal Corporations of the country; because all of you have made relentless efforts during the past five years with dedication and hard work to fulfil the dream of Bapu.

 

From this sacred bank of Sabarmati, I pay my homage to the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and to the former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastriji, a symbol of simplicity.

Friends, 

The holy occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, together with Swachh Bharat Abhiyan's major event and the festival of Shakti i.e. Navratri with an echo of Garba everywhere; Such an amazing and unique coincidence is rarely seen. And our Sarpanch brothers and sisters who have come from all over the country, did you get an opportunity to see the Garba? Did you go to see Garba?

The whole world is celebrating Bapu's birth anniversary. A few days ago the United Nations made this special occasion memorable by issuing postage stamps. And even today postage stamps and coins have been released here. I congratulate the whole world from Bapu's place of inspiration and resolution.

Brothers and sisters, 

I had gone to the Sabarmati Ashram before coming here. I have had the opportunity to visit there many times in my lifetime. Every time I felt the presence of Bapu there, but today I also felt a new energy there. It was at the Sabarmati Ashram that he gave a comprehensive form to the Swachhgraha and Satyagraha. On the banks of this Sabarmati, Mahatma Gandhiji had conducted his experiments with truth.

Brothers and sisters, 

Today this inspiring site of Sabarmati is witnessing a huge success of Swachhgraha. It is an occasion of happiness and pride for all of us. And for me to organize this event on Sabarmati River Front is a matter of immense joy.

Friends, 

Today rural India has declared itself Open Defecation Free. This is not only the power but also the source of success of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, as it saw the public participation voluntarily, in a self-motivated manner. I heartily congratulate every countryman, especially those living in villages, our Sarpanchs, and all the Swachhagrahis today. Today, I also congratulate the Swachhgrahis who have received Swachh Bharat Awards here.

Friends, 

Today I really felt like history is repeating itself. Just as lakhs of Indians came out to follow the path of Satyagraha on a call of Bapu for the independence of the country, in the same way crores of countrymen gave their wholehearted support to cleanliness. Five years ago, when I had appealed to the countrymen for clean India from the ramparts of Red Fort, then we had only and only public trust and Bapu's immortal message. Bapu used to say that the changes we want to see in the world, first have to be brought in ourselves.

Following this mantra, we all picked up the broom and set out. Irrespective of the age, social and economic status, everyone has contributed in this ‘Yajna’ of cleanliness, dignity and respect.

If a daughter places a condition of a toilet being in place before marriage, then the toilet would somewhere get the status of 'Izzatghar'. The toilet, which was once a hush-hush topic to talk about, has become an important part of the thinking of the country. This huge campaign of cleanliness has connected, inspired and encouraged everyone from Bollywood to the playground.

Friends, 

The world is amazed by our success today. Today the whole world is rewarding us for this and is paying us respect. It is astonishing to hear that the facility of toilet has been provided to more than 60 crore population in 60 months, and that more than 11 crore toilets have been constructed. But I have a greater satisfaction than any statistics, any praise, or any honour when I see girls going to school without any worries.

I am satisfied that crores of mothers and sisters are now free from an unbearable pain of waiting for darkness. I am satisfied that the lives of lakhs of innocent people who were dying as a result of severe diseases, are now saved. I am satisfied that due to cleanliness, the expenditure on the treatment of diseases that would have otherwise struck the poor has reduced now. I am satisfied that this campaign has given new employment opportunities to people in rural areas and tribal areas. Earlier the head masons used to be only males; but now sisters were also given the opportunity to work as head masons.

Brothers and sisters, 

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is also proving to be life-saving and is also working to raise the standard of living. According to an estimate by UNICEF, there has been a positive impact of Rs. 20 lakh crore from Swachh Bharat on the Indian economy in the last five years. This has created more than 75 lakh employment opportunities in India, most of which have been received by the sisters and brothers of the villages.

Moreover, it has had a positive impact on the level of education of children, on our productivity and on entrepreneurship. This has brought about a phenomenal change in the situation of protection and empowerment of daughters and sisters in the country. Pujya Mahatma Gandhi wanted such a model to encourage self-reliance and empowerment of the village, the poor and women. This was at the core of Mahatma Gandhi's Swaraj. He had dedicated his life for the same.

Friends, 

But now the question is - whatever we have achieved is that enough? The answer is simple and clear. What we have achieved today is just one stage, only one level. Our journey towards clean India continues unabated.

Now we have built toilets and encouraging people to form the habit of using toilets. Now we have to make this change in the habit of a large section of the country a permanent affair. Be it the governments, local administrations, or Gram Panchayats, we have to ensure that the toilet is properly used. Those who are still out of it will have to be brought under this.

Brothers and sisters, 

The Jal Jeevan Mission that the government has just started, will also help in this matter. We should do whatever we can for water recycling in our homes, villages, and colonies for water recharge. If we can do this, it will help a lot in ensuring a regular and permanent use of the toilet by the people. The government has decided to spend three and a half lakh crore rupees on the Jal-Jeevan Mission. But it is difficult to accomplish this monumental task without the active participation of the countrymen.

Friends, 

Sanitation, environmental protection and the protection of living beings - these three things were favorite subjects of Mahatma Gandhi. Plastic is a major danger for these three. Therefore, we have to achieve the goal of freeing the country from single-use plastic by the year 2022. In the last three weeks, the whole country has given a lot of momentum to this campaign through cleanliness drive. I have been told that about 20 thousand tons of plastic waste has been collected during this period. In the same period, it is also seen that the use of plastic carry bag is decreasing very fast.

I am also aware that today, crores of people across the country have resolved not to use single-use plastic i.e. the plastic that we use once and then throw away and we have to free the country from such plastic. It will benefit the environment, solve big problems that block the roads and sewage of our cities and will also protect our livestock and marine life.

Brothers and sisters,

I would like to reiterate that the most important thing at the core of our movement is behavioral change. This change first starts from self, through self-realization. We learn this lesson from the life of Mahatma Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastriji.

When the country was facing a severe food crisis, Shastriji called upon the countrymen to change their eating habits, but started the change with his own family. This is also the only way for us in this journey of cleanliness, walking upon which we have to reach the destination.

Brothers and sisters, 

Today the whole world wants to learn from this model of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and adopt it. A few days ago, when India was awarded the Global Goal Keeper Award in America, the success of India became known to the whole world.

 

I had also said in the United Nations that India is always ready to share its experiences with other countries. Today we have representatives from Nigeria, Indonesia, and the Mali governments. India will be happy to collaborate with you for cleanliness and sanitation.

Friends, 

Mahatma Gandhi had shown the country the path of truth, non-violence, Satyagraha and self-reliance. Today we are following the same path and are engaged in building a clean, healthy, prosperous and strong New India. Pujya Bapu considered sanitation to be paramount. Like a true disciple, the rural area of ​​the country is paying him obeisant through the work of clean India today. Gandhiji considered health as true wealth and wanted every citizen of the country to be healthy. We are trying to bring this idea into the practice in this country through Yoga Day, Ayushman Bharat and Fit India Movement. 

Gandhiji believed in ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. Now India is helping the world fight against many challenges through its new plans and commitment to the environment. Bapu's dream was of an independent and a self-confident India. Today we are engaged in making these dreams fulfil with Make in India, Startup India, and Stand up India schemes.

 

Gandhiji's resolve was an India where every village is self-reliant. We are taking this resolution towards fulfillment through Rashtriya Gram Swaraj.

Gandhiji used to talk about making every decision for the last person at the bottom-most stratum of the society. We have schemes like Ujjwala, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, Saubhagya Yojana and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan today. Through all these schemes, we have made his mantra a part of the system.

Pujya Bapu had talked of making the lives of people easier by using technology. We are trying to make the lives of the countrymen easier through Aadhaar, Direct Benefit Transfer, Digital India, Bhim app and Digi Locker.

Friends, Mahatma Gandhi used to say that he wanted India to develop so that the whole world could take advantage of it. Gandhiji was clearly of the opinion that one could not be a world figure without being a nationalist. That is, we have to find solutions to our problems first, only then we can help the whole world. Today, India is moving forward with this spirit of nationalism.

Bapu's dream India; a New India is being created. Bapu's dream India - which will be clean and the environment will be protected.

 

Bapu's dream India; where every person will be healthy and fit. Bapu's dream India; where every mother and every child will be nurished.

Bapu's dream India; - where every citizen will feel safe. Bapu's dream India; which will be free from discrimination, and will be full of harmony.

The India of Bapu's dreams - which will follow the ideal of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'. All these elements of Bapu's nationalism will be ideal for the whole world and will become a source of inspiration.

Let us, every Indian, for the sake of humanity, make one resolution to re-establish the values ​​of the Father of the Nation and to fulfil every resolution for the nation. 

Today, I urge the country for 'one person, one resolution'. Make any resolution for the country, which should be useful for the country. It should be a resolve for the welfare of the country and society. I urge you to take at least one resolution and think about your duties and your obligations towards the nation.

Walking on the path of duty, the strength of 130 crore efforts and 130 crore resolutions can do so much for the country. Starting from today, we have to work ceaselessly in this direction for the next one year. Having worked for a year, if this becomes the direction of our life, and our way of life, then this will be a true tribute to Bapu of a grateful nation.

 

With this request and these words, I want to say one more thing - the success that has been achieved is not the success of any government.

The success that has been achieved is not the success of any Prime Minister. The success that has been achieved is not the success of any Chief Minister.

This success has been achieved due to the efforts of 130 crore citizens. It was possible as the senior people of the society have provided leadership and guidance from time to time. And I have seen, five years in a row, all the media houses have taken this forward continuously and have helped positively. The media has played an important role in creating this atmosphere in the country.

Today I salute all those who have worked for this, the 130 crore countrymen. I thank them and I am grateful to them.

With these words, I conclude. You will all say along with me-

I will say- 'Mahatma Gandhi', you all will say loudly with both your hands up - Amar Rahe! Amar Rahe!

 

Mahatma Gandhi - Amar Rahe!

Mahatma Gandhi - Amar Rahe!

Mahatma Gandhi - Amar Rahe!

Once again, I congratulate the nation for accomplishing a very big resolution.

Say along with me-

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the Swachh Bharat Diwas 2019 in Ahmedabad today. He released postage stamp and silver coin to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He also distributed the Swachh Bharat Puraskar to the winners. Earlier in the day, he paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi at Sabarmati Ashram. He  visited the Magan Niwas (Charkha Gallery) and interacted with the children there.


 



Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi while addressing a gathering of Sarpanches at the 'Swachh Bharat Diwas’ programme said that the entire world is commemorating 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and the event has been made more memorable after UN released a postal stamp on Gandhiji a few days back. He said that he had the opportunity to visit Sabarmati Ashram many times in his  lifetime and today like every other time got new energy there as well.

 

PM Modi said that today, the villages have declared themselves free from open defecation and he congratulated every countryman, especially those living in villages, Sarpanches and all those who have worked for 'Swachata'. He added that irrespective of age, social and economic status, everyone has contributed in this pledge of cleanliness, dignity and respect. He said that  today the world is amazed by this success of ours and they are rewarding us. Entire world is amazed that India has provided toilet facilities to more than 60 crore population in 60 months by constructing more than 11 crore toilets, he added.

 

Public participation and voluntarism has been the hallmark of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and the reason for its success, the PM said. He thanked the entire country for the whole hearted support provided for the mission. Stressing on the importance of public participation, Prime Minister said that collective efforts are essential for the success of important government initiatives like Jal Jeevan Mission and eliminating single use plastic by 2022.

 

Prime Minister said that his Government is committed towards realizing the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi. In this context, he mentioned about the initiatives of the government to ensure self-reliance, provide Ease of Living, and taking development to the last mile. He urged the public to take a resolution for the betterment of the nation and strive hard to make it successful. He added that such 130 crore resolutions can bring about a massive transformation.

                On stage, my cabinet colleagues, Dr. Harsh Vardhan Ji and Ashwini Kumar Choubey ji, representatives from different states and institutions, all friends associated with Ayushman Bharat as well as all the beneficiaries of the scheme present here today!

Brothers and sisters, 

Today is the third day of Navratri. Today the Chandraghanta form of the Mother is worshipped. It is believed that the ten-armed goddess Chandraghanta destroys the sufferings of the entire world with the coolness and mildness of the moon. What can be a better coincidence than being able to discuss about the first year of Ayushman Bharat Yojana, which has destroyed the sufferings of more than 50 crore poor people of India.

Friends, 

This first year of Ayushman Bharat has been a resolution, a dedication and a process of learning. It is the power of India's resolve that we are running the world's largest health care scheme with success in India. And behind this success is a sense of dedication, and goodwill. This dedication belongs to every state and Union Territory of the country; this dedication belongs to thousands of government and private hospitals in the country; this dedication belongs to every employee, every medical practitioner, Ayushman Mitra, Asha workers, social organizations, public representatives, that is, everyone.

Brothers and sisters, 

Today due to this dedication, the country is saying with confidence and pride - 'Saal Ek, Ayushman Anek.'

Providing the poor, the 46 lakh poor families across the country a hope for a healthy life from the hopelessness of diseases, is indeed a great achievement. In this one year, if any person's land, house or jewelry or any other item has been saved from being sold or mortgaged for covering the expenses of treatment against any disease, then this Ayushman can be considered as a great success in India.

Friends, 

I had the opportunity to talk to some of the beneficiaries a short while ago. In the last one year, even during the elections, I have constantly tried to communicate with all such friends across the country. After talking to them, one can realize the kind of changes Ayushman Bharat - ‘PMJAY’ is bringing about in the lives of the poor. And in a way PMJAY has now become the Jai or victory of the poor. When the child of the poor is healthy, when the sole earner of the household goes back to work healthy, then one understands the meaning of being healthy. And so, those people and institutions dedicated and devoted to the success of Ayushman Bharat 'PMJAY' have the best wishes of crores of poor people of the country. I congratulate every partner involved in this great work.

Brothers and sisters, 

In this first year, with determination and dedication, we have learned a lot though experience. Now I have also seen the one year journey through the exhibition before coming here. It depicted the way we have overcome every challenge over time, made technical expansion continuously, maintained constant communication with every stake holder, and removed doubts and apprehensions. The process of learning, dialogue and improvement will go on continuously.

Friends, 

How the reach and monitoring the scheme can be made more effective; how to make it easily accessible to the beneficiaries; how to overcome the problems of hospitals - all these aspects have been discussed here in detail during the last two days. Candid views have been placed here from quality to capacity building. Some states have shared their experiences especially with regard to the universal health care coverage or how the scope of this scheme should be applicable to every family, and these should be given serious consideration. It is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that for every poor, every citizen, the doors of the hospital should be open in difficult times, and better treatment should be available to them.

Brothers and sisters, 

Ayushman Bharat is one of the revolutionary steps of New India. Not only because it is playing an important role in saving the lives of the common man and the poor of the country, but also because it is a symbol of the collective resolve and strength of 130 crore people representing India. That is why I am saying that earlier also efforts were made in our country to provide cheap and better health care services to the poor. Every state and every Union Territory has done everything possible at its level. Despite the good intention of the states, neither the poor were getting that benefit, nor was there any improvement in the field of medical infrastructure. But Ayushman Bharat has proved that whenever the collective strength of India is applied, then its benefit and power have far-reaching effect. Ayushman Bharat ensures that the patients from any part of the country are benefitted which was previously impossible. This is the reason that in the last one year, about 50 thousand beneficiaries have taken advantage of this scheme in other states, i.e. outside their state in a good hospital.

 

 

Brothers and sisters, 

No one in the country wants to move away from his/her home, district, or state for treatment, unless compelled to do so. Every state is making efforts for every citizen of the country to provide the best healthcare facilities near home. It is also true that in those parts of the country where health facilities are better, there is more pressure; but it is the responsibility of every Indian to ensure that no citizen of the country should be deprived of modern healthcare services. Ayushman Bharat is reinforcing this sentiment.

Friends, 

Ayushman Bharat is a holistic solution for the whole of India and a healthy India. This is in line with the government's idea under which we are working together comprehensively instead of thinking in isolation to deal with India's problems and challenges. A few days ago, there was a program in the United Nations about Universal Health Care, in which I had the opportunity to talk about India. The world is amazed and surprised at the way the holistic approach is being followed with respect to health care in India and the scale at which the work is being done. 

Brothers and sisters, 

I told the delegates from all over the world about the way we are building a healthy India on four strong pillars. First: Preventive Health Care; Second: Affordable Health Care; Third: Supply Side Reforms and Fourth: Mission Mode Interventions like National Nutrition Campaign.

If we talk about the first pillar, today cleanliness, yoga, AYUSH, vaccination and fitness are being emphasized so that diseases related to lifeline are minimized. Moreover, diseases spread by animals also trouble humans. And so this time we have taken up the task in a mission mode - freeing India from the Foot-and-mouth disease found in animals. That is, we are concerned about the animals too; we have not forgotten them.

I also talked about another pillar there. The second pillar, that is, constant efforts are being made to ensure that the common man of the country gets the best and cheapest treatment.

Brothers and sisters, 

Ayushman Bharat scheme is giving a lot of boost to these two pillars. Whether it is the construction of more than one and a half lakh Health and Wellness centers across the country or the facility of free treatment up to five lakh rupees every year, the role of Ayushman Bharat is important.

Friends, 

Ayushman Bharat is also strengthening our third pillar, the supply side. The demand for healthcare services has increased in the country due to Ayushman Bharat. Now those poor patients are also coming to the hospital who had never even thought about treatment. They could not ever imagine treatment in private hospitals. Today, out of more than 18,000 hospitals serving PMJAY, about 10,000, i.e. more than half of such hospitals are in private sector. This participation is going to increase further in the future.

Friends, 

As the demand is increasing, so is the network of modern medical infrastructure in small cities of the country. Many new hospitals are going to come up in the future. New employment opportunities are coming up. According to an estimate, about 11 lakh new jobs will be created in the coming five to seven years only due to the demand generated by the Ayushman Bharat scheme. This is such a huge number that one can gauge it from the fact that only the railways create more jobs than this.

Brothers and sisters, 

It is very important to train our young friends for these employment opportunities. This is the reason why the infrastructure related to medical education is being expanded and the policy is constantly being modified. On the one hand, the number of seats in medical education is being increased in the country, while on the other hand a seamless and transparent arrangement is being made ranging from admission to regulation. Whether it is the decision to set up 75 new government medical colleges across the country or the creation of new National Medical Commission in the country, the medical sector is going to be benefitted for sure.

 

The National Medical Commission will accelerate the expansion of medical education in the country, improve its quality and remove corruption.

Friends, 

To make the Ayushman Bharat scheme user friendly, constant efforts are being made to make it foolproof. And I am told that the IT system associated with it has been upgraded to PMJAY 2.0 and is constantly being upgraded. The app launched today will help the beneficiaries a lot. But we need more technical solutions to make this scheme more efficient and more comprehensive. Ayushman Bharat has different components; so, an effective and accessible system is needed to link these components. We have to develop a technology based system of diagnosis, referral and follow up care, from Health and Wellness centers to Operation Theaters of major hospitals. We have to move towards the situation where the health data of any person registered in the Health and Wellness Center of the village is used in the diagnosis of that person's illness. On referring to larger hospitals, this data could play an effective role in further treatment. For this, we all have to think, and we will have to add new generation of people.

Friends, 

The PMJAY Startup Grand Challenge launched today is going to play a significant role. And I would urge the youth power of the country, especially the IT Professionals, to take up this work of humanity by accepting this challenge and to come up with a best solution in the future. Through this, start-ups working in the health sector across the country are being linked with Ayushman Bharat. I once again urge all the young entrepreneurs and innovators of the country to take advantage of this opportunity.

Brothers and sisters, 

New India's health care system is truly going to be an example for the whole world. Ayushman Bharat Yojana will also be a major contributor to this. I hope our commitment to make crores of people of our country healthy be strengthened further and may our efforts be successful. With this desire, I thank you very much from the heart and my best wishes to all of you.

                21 Year Old Sanjay Vargem was admitted on 14/02/2019 with chest pain, Palpitation, Vertigo, Cough and shortness of breath due to exertion for 1-2 years.

After thorough investigations it was diagnosed that he needed a double valve replacement in his heart.

Since he belonged to a very poor family, he could not afford the treatment prescribed by the doctor. As a result, he and his family returned to their village lost hope. But soon after they returned, they got to know about PM-JAY, which came as a boon to Sanjay and his family. The surgery which would otherwise cost him 2 Lakh Rupees was conducted for free under PM-Jay on the 18th of February 2019.



He is now relieved the pain and is leading a happier and healthier life.

Today he is a healthy man and was one of the 31 beneficiaries who met the Prime Minister to explain the success of the World’s largest health scheme.

Launched exactly a year ago in 2018, Ayushman Bharat is world’s largest health insurance scheme, which aims to provide easy access to medical facilities to over 10.74 Crore poor people in the country.

In the last one year over 50,000 patients like Sanjay Vargem could get access to medical facilities outside their state where best such facilities were available owing to the Ayushman Bharat programme.



Under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya (PM-JAY), 16,085 Hospitals have been empanelled, over 41 lakh beneficiaries have been treated and over 10 Crore e-Cards issued.

Over 20,700 Health & Wellness Centers have become operational across the country under Ayushman Bharat.

                35 year old Dwijen Kalita from Assam, a poor paddy farmer suffered severe head injury. When he was admitted to the Kamrup Metro Hospital, he was semiconscious and was in agonising pain. Post detailed examination he was diagnosed with subdural haematoma which means he needed neurosurgery, Cranioplasty and an exogenous graft.

Since Kalita’s economic condition was poor it seemed impossible for his family to bear the treatment expenses.



However the family found its real hope when they were informed of the Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY under which he could undergo the prescribed treatment for free.

Kalita feels that the scheme is a blessing for poor people like him.



Today he is a healthy man and was one of the 31 beneficiaries who met the Prime Minister to explain the success of the World’s largest health scheme.

                52 Year Old Ratan Barai from Andaman and Nicobar hails from a poor family and was suffering from Myocardial Infarction.

He was admitted to the G B Pant Hospital in Port Blair pain on the left side of the chest and profuse sweating. He also had Diabetes Mellitus. Investigations revealed Acute Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction. He was stabilized with medical management and later referred to cardiologists in the mainland for further expert treatment.



Since there is no treatment facility for heart ailments in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, all such patients travel to mainland India for treatment in cities like Kolkata and Chennai.

For RatanBarai this was difficult as he did not have enough money.

However when he learnt of the cashless insurance protection through Ayushman Bharat- PMJAY it brought a new ray of hope in his life. With its help he was then able to get the prescribed treatment for free.



Today he is a healthy man and was one of the 31 beneficiaries who met the Prime Minister to explain the success of the World’s largest health scheme.

Launched exactly a year ago in 2018, Ayushman Bharat is world’s largest health insurance scheme, which aims to provide easy access to medical facilities to over 10.74 Crore poor people in the country.

In the last one year over 50,000 patients like Ratan Barai could get access to medical facilities outside their state where best such facilities were available owing to the Ayushman Bharat programme.

Under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya (PM-JAY), 16,085 Hospitals have been empanelled, over 41 lakh beneficiaries have been treated and over 10 Crore e-Cards issued.

Over 20,700 Health & Wellness Centers have become operational across the country under Ayushman Bharat.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched a new mobile application for the Ayushman Bharat, the world’s largest health insurance scheme aimed at securing the health of over 10.70 Crore Poor families in the country. 

The Prime Minister was presiding over the over the valedictory function of Arogya Manthan at New Delhi today.  

He interacted with select beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri - Jan Arogya Yojana PM-JAY. 

He visited the exhibition on PM-JAY which showcased the journey of the scheme over the past one year. 

He also launched the ‘Ayushman Bharat Start-Up Grand Challenge’ and released a commemorative stamp on the occasion.



 

Speaking on the occasion, the PM said “the first year of Ayushman Bharat has been about resolution, dedication and mutual learning. We are running the world's largest health care scheme successfully in India due to our determination.” 

He said that the access to medical facilities should be easily available to every poor and every citizen in the country. 

He also said that there is a sense of dedication behind this success and this dedication belongs to every state and union territory of the country. 

He added that it is a great achievement to awaken hope among the lakhs of poor people of the country to recover from the disease. PM Modi said that in the last one year, if any one person's land, house, jewelry or any other items are saved from mortgage or sale for medical treatment, then this is a huge success of Ayushman India. 

The Prime Minister said in the last one year about 50,000 poor could avail the benefit under PMJAY outside their district and state where they could get better facilities. 

PM  Modi said that Ayushman Bharat is one of the revolutionary steps of New India and not just because it is playing an important role in saving the life of an ordinary person, but it is also a symbol of the dedication and strength of 130 crore people of the country. 

He added that Ayushman Bharat is a collective solution for the whole of India as well as a holistic solution for a healthy India. He also said that this is an extension of the government's thinking under which we are working in totality instead of thinking in pieces to deal with India's problems and challenges. Ayushman Bharat ensures better treatment to patients in any part of the country. 

Arogya Manthan is a two-day event organized by the National Health Authority, to mark the completion of one year of Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY. The purpose of the Arogya Manthan is to provide a platform to meet for all the important stakeholders of PM-JAY to meet and discuss the challenges faced in the implementation of the scheme in the past year and to forge new understanding and pathways to improving implementation.

                The Union Cabinet approved the Regulations for conferring/ recognizing ownership or mortgage/ transfer rights to residents of Unauthorized Colonies (UCs) in Delhi. The Cabinet further approved bringing a Bill in the next session of Parliament to implement the proposal. 

Major impact & benefit to the People living in Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi:


	The decision will benefit more than 40 lakh residents of unauthorized colonies spread over around 175 sq kms, as development / redevelopment can now take place in these colonies resulting in a clean, secure and healthy living environment.
	This landmark initiative will address major issues being faced by the residents of UCs like lack ownership/transfer rights, provision of basic infrastructure and civic amenities.  
	With recognition of property documents, the property holders in these colonies can now enter into valid property transactions. Besides providing a legitimate claim to the property, the decision will encourage property holders to invest in safe structures, thereby improving the living conditions in these colonies substantially.  
	The decision is applicable to 1,797 identified UCs, which are inhabited by lower income group society.  The decision does not apply to 69 affluent colonies identified by DDA, including Sainik Farms, Mahendru Enclave and Anant Ram Dairy.
	The rights will be conferred on payment of nominal charge based on carpet area/plot size. For colonies on Government land, the charge will be 0.5% (for less than 100 sq m), 1% (for 100 - 250 sqm) and  2.5%  (for greater than 250 sqm), of the circle rate of highest category of locality of the residential area surrounding the UC. 
	For colonies on private land, the charge will be half of the charge on government land. 


 

Details:


	In the ensuing session of the Parliament, the Central Government will introduce a Bill for recognizing General Power of Attorney (GPA), Will, Agreement to Sell, Purchase and possession documents, which will be a one-time relaxation for this purpose for the residents of UCs. 
	The Bill will provide for registration charge & stamp duty on last transaction and also address the issue of income tax liability on account of less than circle rate charges.
	DDA will lay down a simplified procedure for issuing conveyance deed and registration of property.
	Boundaries of the UCs/ clusters of UCs will be delineated by DDA.
	DDA will prepare Local Area Plan (LAP) for all UCs. 
	There will be no Penalty and external development charges (EDC). 
	Multiple plots/flats holders will be charged on the rate applicable to area by clubbing all properties. 
	Residents will have option to pay charge in three equal instalments to be paid in a year.  Any person paying full amount in one instalment will get the ownership rights immediately.  Provisional rights will be given on payment of 02 instalments, which will be converted to permanent rights after full and final payment.
	Late payment to attract simple interest @ 8% pa.
	Conveyance deed will be executed for residential purpose, irrespective of use. 


 

Background:


	As per the existing Regulations of 2008, the entire process of regularization was to be coordinated and supervised by Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, (GNCTD) by giving wide publicity. Delineation of boundary of UC is the starting point of the process as per the Regulations. However, GNCTD could not delineate the boundaries of these colonies even after 11 years of issuance of the Regulations and has sought more time upto 2021 to complete this exercise. 
	People living in these UCs have neither invested in safe structures nor could the Government create any social infrastructure on account of these colonies having developed without approved Layout Plan (LOP). In the absence of basic amenities, the residents of these colonies are living in uninhabitable conditions. Though the Master Plan Delhi-2021 allows for redevelopment of colonies with 50% additional Floor Area Ratio (FAR) as an incentive, no redevelopment has taken place so far as the residents do not have ownership rights.
	In order to confer/ recognize ownership or mortgage/ transfer rights to residents of UCs, a Committee, headed by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, was constituted, with approval of the Union Cabinet, to recommend the process for conferment/recognition of rights of ownership or transfer/mortgage of property and thereby create an opportunity for redevelopment of such areas in a planned manner. 
	Based on the recommendations of the Committee and elaborate consultations with all stakeholders the above proposals to notify revised Regulations and introduce a Bill in the Parliament have been finalised.

                The Union Cabinet today approved the proposal for revival of BSNL and MTNL by administrative allotment of spectrum for 4G services, debt restructuring by raising of bonds with sovereign guarantee, reducing employee costs, monetisation of assets and in-principle approval of merger of BSNL & MTNL.

The following was approved by the cabinet:-


	Administrative allotment of spectrum for 4G services to BSNL and MTNL so as to enable these PSUs to provide broadband and other data services. The said Spectrum will be funded by the Government of India by capital infusion in these PSUs at a value of Rs 20,140 Cr in addition; the GST amount of Rs 3,674 Cr to this spectrum value will also be borne by the Government of India through Budgetary resources. By using this spectrum allotment, BSNL and MTNL will be able to deliver 4G services, compete in the market and provide high speed data using their vast network including in rural areas.


 


	BSNL and MTNL will also raise long-term bonds of Rs 15,000 Cr for which sovereign guarantee will be provided by the Government of India (GoI). With the said resources, BSNL and MTNL will restructure their existing debt and also partly meet CAPEX, OPEX and other requirements.


 


	BSNL and MTNL will also offer Voluntary Retirement to their employees, aged 50 years and above through attractive Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), the cost of which will be borne by the Government of India through budgetary support. The ex-gratia component of VRS will require Rs. 17,169 Cr in addition, GoI will be meeting the cost towards Pension, Gratuity and Commutation. Details of the scheme will be finalised by BSNL/MTNL. 


 


	BSNL and MTNL will monetise their assets so as to raise resources for retiring debt, servicing of bonds, network upgradation, expansion and meeting the operational fund requirements.


 


	In-principle merger of BSNL and MTNL


 

It is expected that with the implementation of said revival plan, BSNL and MTNL will be able to provide reliable and quality services through its robust telecommunication network throughout the country including rural and remote areas.

Benefits:

          The MoUs with the Foreign Broadcasters will help:


	Public broadcaster in exploring new visions;
	New Strategies to address the demands of new technologies and stiff competition;
	Media liberalization; and
	Globalization.


 

Major Impact:

Broadcasting of programmes to be obtained through mutual exchange, co-production will lead to equity and inclusiveness among viewer/listeners of DD and AIR. Exchanges of technical Know-how, expertise and training of manpower would help the public broadcaster to meet the emerging challenges in the field of broadcasting.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of the Progress under National Health Mission (NHM) and Decisions of the Empowered Programme Committee and Mission Steering Group of the NHM.

Key elements Salient features:


	There has been acceleration in decline of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), Under Five Mortality Rate (U5MR) and the IMR since the launch of the NRHM/NHM. At the current rate of decline, India should able to reach its SDG target (MMR-70, U5MR-25) much before the due year i.e. 2030.
	India was the biggest success story amongst Malaria endemic countries in the World, in bringing down the Malaria cases and deaths which have declined by 49.09% and 50.52% in 2013 respectively compared to 2017.
	Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) has been significantly strengthened and intensified. A total of 1,180 CBNAAT machines across all districts have been installed which provides rapid and accurate diagnosis for TB including drug resistant TB. This has resulted in three-fold increased use of CBNAAT over the past year. Due to the intensified efforts, there is 16% jump in identification of new cases in one year. Universal drug sensitive cases also increased by 54%. Newer drug regimen of Bedaquiline and Delaminide and nutrition support to all the TB patients for the duration of the treatment has been rolled throughout the country.
	In 2018-19, 52744 AB-HWCs were approved against which 17149 HWCs were operationalized against the target of 15000.A total of 1, 81,267 Health workers which included ASHAs, MPHWs, Staff Nurses and PHC-MOs were trained on NCDs during 2018-19. The states have initiated activities to operationalize the HWCs.
	Amongst the new vaccines, Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine replaced Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine under universal immunization programme in 2018 to ensure Diphtheria immunity among adults.
	In 2018, Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccination drive was conducted in 17 additional States, thereby covering 30.50 Crores children till March 2019.
	During 2018-19, Rotavirus vaccine (RVV) was introduced in additional two States. Till today, all the States/UTs are covered with RVV. 
	During 2018-19, Pneumococcal Conjugated Vaccine (PCV) was expanded to MP, Haryana and the remaining districts of Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.   
	The routine and recurring incentives of ASHAs got increased from 1000 per month to 2000 per month. ASHAs and ASHA Facilitators were provided the cover of Pradhan Mantri Jevan Jyoti BeemaYojna (Premium of Rs. 330 contributed by Gol) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BeemaYojna (Premium of Rs.12 contributed by Gol).  
	Anaemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) Abhiyaan was launched under POSHAN Abhiyaan in April 2018.   
	The untied funds amount was increased from Rs, 20,000 to Rs 50,000 for sub health Centres transformed to HWCs. 
	Home Based Care for Young Child (HBYC) programme was introduced under POSHAN Abhiyaan. 
	The scheme for awarding States/UTs/Districts for achieving disease free status in TB/Leprosy/Malaria/Kala-Azar/Lymphatic-Filariasis/Cataract was approved. This will allow certification of the districts/ states as Disease Free ahead of the national certification and promote healthy competition among states and districts, similar to ODF districts and states.  
	National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme was approved for prevention, management and treatment of Hepatitis to A, B, C and E and rollout was initiated. This would benefit an estimated 5 crore patients of Hepatitis.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the relaxation of the mandatory requirement of Aadhaar Seeded data as a pre-condition for release of funds to the beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri KisanSamman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) scheme.

The scheme provides income support of Rs 6,000 per year to landholding families, subject to certain exclusions. The amount is released in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs 2,000 each directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT mode.

Under this scheme, after 1st August, 2019, release of 3rd Instalment onwards to those beneficiaries who got first instalment during December, 2018 - March, 2019 and 2nd instalment during April-July, 2019 is to be made only on the basis of Aadhaar seeded database. Similarly, after 1st August, 2019, release of 2nd instalment onwards to those who got 1st instalment during April-July, 2019 is to be made only on the basis of Aadhaar seeded database. Again, after 1st August, 2019, release of 1st instalment onwards to the rest of the beneficiaries after 1st August, 2019 is to be made only on the basis of Aadhaar seeded database. Farmers in the States of Assam, Meghalaya and J&K, where there has not been enough Aadhaar penetration, have been exempted from this requirement till 31.3.2020.

However, it has not been possible to get 100% Aadhaar seeding for release of funds as per the prescribed time schedule before release of instalments after 1st August, 2019. Since the farmers are still gearing up for Rabi season, they are in dire need of money to take care of various farming activities like procurement of seeds, preparation of soil and other associated activities like irrigation, maintenance and mobilization of machinery and tools. Over and above these pressing needs, the just started festive season will put further stress on the financial condition of the poor farmers' households in the country. Non-seeding of beneficiaries' details with Aadhaar number will delay the release of further instalments and will cause discontentment among the farmers. Therefore, the mandatory requirement of Aadhaar seeding for release of benefits after 1st August, 2019 has been relaxed till 30th November, 2019. This will enable immediate release of benefits to a large number of farmers who are not able to avail the same due this requirement. This mandatory requirement will remain applicable for release of benefits w.e.f. 1st December, 2019 onwards. The Government will take adequate measures to validate the data before payment is made.

Background:

 

The Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri KisanSamman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) provides income support to land-holding farmers' families, subject to certain exclusions, by way of payment of Rs.6000/- per year. The amount is released in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs.2000 /- each directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT mode. A total amount of more than Rs.27000 crores has already been released under the scheme through the 1st instalment to 6,76,76,073 beneficiaries, 2nd instalment to 5,14,27,195 beneficiaries and 3rd instalment to 1,74,20,230 beneficiaries.

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today approved to release an additional instalment of Dearness Allowance (DA) to Central Government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) to pensioners w.e.f. 01.07.2019 representing an increase of 5% over the existing rate of 12% of the Basic pay/Pension, to compensate for price rise.  This increase is in accordance with the accepted formula, which is based on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission.  

 This will benefit about 49.93 lakh Central Government employees and 65.26 lakh pensioners. 

The additional financial implication on account of this increase in Dearness Allowance is estimated at Rs 8590.20 Crore per year; and Rs 5726.80 Crore in the current Financial Year of 2019-20 (for 8 months from July 2019 to February 2020).

The additional financial implication on account of the Dearness Relief to pensioners is estimated to be Rs 7319.15 Crore per annum and Rs 4870 Crore in the current FY.

Dear Allowance/Dearness Relief is paid to Central Government employees/pensioners to adjust the cost of living and to protect their basic pay/pension from erosion in the real value. Dear Allowance/Dearness Relief is revised twice a year from 1st January and 1st July.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved Inclusion of 5,300 DP families of Jammu & Kashmir-1947 who initially opted to move outside the State of Jammu & Kashmir but later on returned and settled in the State of Jammu & Kashmir, in the Rehabilitation Package approved by the Cabinet on 30.11.2016 for Displaced Families PoJK and Chhamb under the PM’s Development Package 2015 for Jammu & Kashmir.

Benefits:

The approval will enable such DP Families to become eligible to get one-time financial assistance of Rs 5.5 Lakhs under the existing scheme, and in turn, be able to get some sustained income which the existing scheme is aimed at. 

It is mentioned here that in the wake of the1947 Pakistani aggression in J&K, 31,619 families migrated from Pakistan Occupied Areas of J&K (PoJK) to the state of J&K. Of these, 26,319 families settled in the state of J&K and 5300 families initially opted to move out of the state of J&K to other parts of the country. Further during the Indo-Pak wars of 1965 and 1971 10,065 more families were displaced from ChhambNiabat area. Of these 3,500 families were displaced during the 1965 war and 6565 families were displaced during the 1971 war.

The 36,384 displaced families covered under the package approved by the Cabinet on 30.11.2016 included 26,319 displaced families from PoJK settled in J&K and 10,065 Displaced Families displaced from ChhambNiabat area. The 5300 DP families of PoJK who initially opted to move out of the state of J&K to other parts of the country were not included in the approved package. Now those DP families out of the 5300 who initially opted to move out of the State but later returned and settled in J&K are being included in the package.

Inclusion of those DP Families out of 5,300 DP families of PoJK 1947 who have returned and settled in the State of Jammu & Kashmir in the existing scheme, who have suffered on account of wars and hostilities, will enable them to earn a reasonable monthly income and be part of mainstream economic activities. This will also upgrade the Government’s capacity to respond effectively to such DP families need of financial assistance. Requirement of funds will be met out of the already sanctioned funds for the existing scheme.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the Review of Guidelines for Granting Authorization to market Transportation Fuels. This marks a major reform of the guidelines for marketing of petrol and diesel. 

The existing policy for granting authorization to market transportation fuels had not undergone any changes for the last 17 years since 2002. It has now been revised to bring it in line with the changing market dynamics and with a view to encourage investment from private players, including foreign players, in this sector. The new Policy will give a fillip to ‘Ease of Doing Business’, with transparent policy guidelines. It will boost direct and indirect employment in the sector. Setting up of more retail outlets (ROs) will result in better competition and better services for consumers

Salient features & Major Impact:


	Much lower entry barrier for private players - the entities seeking authorisation would need to have a minimum net worth of Rs.250 crore vis-à-vis the current requirement of Rs. 2000 crore prior investment.
	Non – Oil Companies can also invest in the retail sector. Requirement of prior investment in Oil and Gas Sector, mainly in exploration and production, refining, pipelines/terminals etc., has been done away with.
	The entities seeking market authorisation for petrol and diesel are allowed to apply for retail and bulk authorisation separately or both
	The companies have been given flexibility in setting up a Joint Venture or Subsidiary for market authorisation.
	In addition to conventional fuels, the authorized entities are required to install facilities for marketing at least one new generation alternate fuel, like CNG, LNG, biofuels, electric charging, etc. at their proposed retail outlets within 3 years of operationalization of the said outlet
	More private players, including Foreign players, are expected to invest in retail fuel marketing leading to better competition and better services for consumers 
	The new entities will bring in latest technology for marketing of fuels and also encourage digital payments at the ROs.
	Entities will also encourage employment of women and ex-servicemen at the retail outlets. 
	CCTV facilities will be set up at all retail outlets
	The authorised entities are required to set up minimum 5% of the total retail outlets in the notified remote areas within 5 years of grant of authorisation. A robust monitoring mechanism has been set up to monitor this obligation.
	An individual may be allowed to obtain dealership of more than one marketing company in case of open dealerships of PSU OMCs but at different sites.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the increase in the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for all mandated Rabi Crops of 2019-20 to be marketed in Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2020-21.

Benefits and Major Impact:

The increase in MSP for Rabi Crops for RMS 2020-21 is in line with the principle of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 1.5 times of the all India weighted average cost of production (CoP), which was announced in the Union Budget 2018-19.

This MSP policy whereby the farmers are assured of a minimum of 50 percent as margin of profit is one of the important and progressive steps towards doubling farmers' income by 2022 and improving their welfare substantively.

For the Rabi crops of RMS 2020-21, the highest increase in MSP has been recommended for lentil (Rs. 325 per quintal) followed by safflower (Rs. 270 per quintal) and gram (Rs. 255 per quintal) which is a major step towards increasing the income of farmers. 

The MSP of Rapeseed & Mustard has been increased by Rs. 225 per quintal. For both wheat and barley, the MSP has been increased by Rs. 85 per quintal. Wheat farmers will hence get a return over cost of 109 percent (refer table below).

Cost of production is one of the important factors in the determination of MSPs. This year's increase in MSP of Rabi crops for RMS 2020-21 provides higher than 50 per cent return (except safflower) over all India weighted average cost of production. The return over all India weighted average cost of production is 109 per cent for wheat; 66 per cent for barley; 74 per cent for gram: 76 per cent for lentil; 90% for rapeseed & mustard and 50 per cent for safflower.

* Refers to comprehensive cost which includes all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human It/hour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel electricity for operation of pump sets etc., miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour.

In the case of cereals, FCI and other designated State agencies would continue to provide price support to the farmers. State Governments will undertake procurement of coarse grains with the prior approval of Government and would distribute the entire procured quantity under NFSA. The subsidy will be provided only for the quantity issued under NFSA. NAFED, SFAC and other designated Central agencies would continue to undertake procurement of pulses and oilseeds. The losses, if any incurred by the nodal agencies in such operations may be fully reimbursed by the Government as per the guidelines.

With the intention of giving enough policy thrust to income security of the farmers, Government's focus has shifted from production-centric approach to income-centric one. Enhancing the coverage of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) to all farmers in its first Union Cabinet meeting on 31st May 2019, is another major step in boosting the income of the farmers. The PM-KISAN Yojana was announced in the interim Budget for the year 2019-2020, where the small and marginal landholder farmer families with cultivable land holding upto 2 hectare across the country were assured of Rs 6000 per year.

 

 

The new Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan” (PM-AASHA) announced by the government in 2018 will aid in providing remunerative return to farmers for their produce. The Umbrella Scheme consists of three sub-schemes i.e. Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Private Procurement &Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on a pilot basis.

An MOU has been signed between All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) under Ministry of AYUSH and Frankfurter Innovationszentrum Biotechnologie GmbH (FiZ) here today. The MoU signed by Prof. Tanuja Nesari Director AIIA and Dr Christian Garbe, Managing Director of Frankfurter Innovationszentrum Biotechnologie GmbH (FiZ), was agreed at FiZ on the occasion of the event “German/Indian knowledge exchange regarding current developments in the health care sector” by Dr Garbe with Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH, during September of this year. 

One important goal of the collaboration is to research in the field of genomics and develop evidence-based guidelines supported with latest technologies like Artificial Intelligence and machine learning so as to integrate Ayurvedic principles and practises into modern medicine for the wider reach to the masses. Further, exchange of knowledge and experiences will be another component in the MoU.

Speaking after the singing of the MOU, Dr.Vaidya, Secretary, AYUSH said that the systems appear to be quiet different at first glance. On deeper observation, it appears that both the sciences can support each other. Complementing the traditional Ayurveda Medicine with conventional concepts of Biotechnology is expected in generating evidences that further help in contributing to the global healthcare, he added. 



On this occasion, Dr. Garbe said that for years there have been diverse contacts with India in order to foster both, share experience and know-how in our network and render technological knowledge economically usable as well. He explained that empirical medicine and precision medicine will become productive partners.

Director, All India Institute of Ayurveda Prof. Tanuja Nesari said that the Ayurveda is the time tested science focussed upon providing healthy life through wholeness of body, mind, and soul considering different aspects including environmental factors.

                The Union Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that we have been able to fulfil the vision of Homi Bhabha. He added that Homi Bhabha had then said that India’s nuclear power will be for peaceful purposes. The Government has diversified the applications of nuclear energy in various social fields. He was speaking at the inauguration of 11th Nuclear Energy Conclave, being held here today. 

The Minister said that the Government has taken various steps to promote the scientific temper in the country, specially in the Department of Atomic Energy and Space. He said earlier the Atomic power plants were restricted in Southern India, now the Government is setting up the nuclear plants in other parts of the country. A nuclear plant is coming up in the Gorakhpur of Haryana, he added. He said that the Headquarters of both the departments are outside Delhi. To educate the students and general public about the applications of  nuclear energy, a “Hall of Nuclear Energy” was opened in Pragati Maidan in Delhi and a similar Hall is being planned for the Department of Space, he added. Dr Jitendra Singh said that under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, we have been able to achieve much in these fields in the last five years. He quoted various examples  such as joint ventures in nuclear energy and increase in budget etc. He also spoke about the use of nuclear energy in the field of medicine, specially cancer care. He added that the Dr B.Borooah Cancer Institute in Guwahati has been affiliated to the Tata Memorial Centre for Cancer, Mumbai. The Minister said that DAE is also working towards the implementation of flagship programmes of the Government, with Tata Memorial Centre being the first to shift to cashless transactions.

The Minister said that awareness needs to be created among the public about busting the myths associated with the use of nuclear energy. He said that the nuclear energy is a source of energy to meet the rising energy demands of India. He added that in our day to day life, it is an instrument of ‘ease of living’.  

The Secretary, DAE and Chairman, AEC, Dr K N Vyas speaking on the “Long term vision for Nuclear Energy” said that climate change scenario has gone more grimmer and it is dangerous to the humanity if we continue the business as usual. He emphasised on the reduction in the carbonisation. He said that nuclear energy is an undeniable option to fight global warming. He added that other sources such as solar and wind energy require large land and other technologies, being expensive in nature. Dr Vyas said that India has gained large experience in construction and commissioning of reactors. 

The Former Chairman, AEC, Dr Anil Kakodkar spoke on “Nuclear Power India’s Development Imperatives”. He said that access to the imported uranium can accelerate the nuclear program size as well as large scale thorium deployment. We have now much lesser constraints to move ahead, he added. He talked about Short term actions on the part of DAE such as early movement on FBR deployment and early deployment of indigenous LWRs. He also spoke about some urgent actions Th-LEV fuelled AHWR for zero impact in public domain. The NPCIL should focus on cost competitiveness and short project gestation period to realise low tariff. Dr Kakodhar said that given our large energy endowments in terms on thorium and solar energy, can India become a net exporter of clean and safe energy before it is too late. He  

The Member, AEC, Dr RB Grover, while speaking on “Comparing electricity generation technologies from consideration of economics” said that globally electricity generation contributes to 40% of carbon emission, the next target being transport sector. He added that for any technology to succedd, it has to be robust and commercial. 

The Chairman, Nuclear Energy Group, India Energy Forum and Chancellor Homi Bhabha National Institute, Dr. Srikumar Banerjee said that nuclear energy is what we can claim to be totally indigenous. 

The President, India Energy Forum (IEF) and Former Secretary, Ministry of Power, Government of India Shri Anil Razdan and the Convenor, Nuclear, IEF and Former ED, BHEL, Shri SM Mahajan also spoke on the occasion. 

During the conclave, three technical sessions are also being held on the themes: “Growth of Nuclear Power for Meeting Base Load Demands- Opportunities & Challenges for Manufacturing Industry” , “Use of Nuclear Energy in Healthcare and Municipal Waste Treatment” and “Emerging Technologies for Economy and Enhanced Safety viz, Small & Medium Size reactors, Passive Safety features, Molten Salt Reactors”, chaired by Shri AK Balasubrahmanian, Director (Tech.), NPCIL and Shri G Nageswara Rao, Chairman, AERB and Dr A K Bhaduri, Director, IGCAR, respectively. The eminent speakers include Dr Dinesh Srivastava, CE, Nuclear Fuel Complex, Shri Nikita Mazein, President, Rosatom Overseas, Shri Thomas Mieusset, Nuclear Counselor, French Embassy India,  Shri YS Trivedi, Sr. Executive Vice President, Larsen & Toubro Ltd. Other speakers being, Dr Srikumar Banerjee on “Molten Salt Reactors” and Dr Arun Nayak, Reactor Engineering Division, BARC on “Concept design of Passive Safe Integral LWRs for Accelerated Capacity Building”. Dr Harsh Mahajan, MD, Mahajan Imaging on Nuclear Energy for Diagnostics, Dr Sudeep Gupta, Director, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre on “Nuclear Energy for Therapeutics” and Ms Kritika Kaur, Technical Manager, Nuvia India on “Management of radioactive Waste in Health Care & research Sectors” are other distinguished speakers.

                As a part of the year-long Birth Centenary celebrations of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space have organized a two day programme  in Mumbai beginning from today. The programme was a curtain raiser to commemorate Dr. Vikram Sarabhai’s contribution towards DAE. 

A number of  contemporaries of Dr. Sarabhai participated in the event. Luminaries like Dr. Kasturirangan, (former Chairman, ISRO) Dr. M.R. Srinivasan, (former Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission  & Secretary Department of Atomic Energy),  Shri Surendar Sharma (former Chief Executive, Heavy Water Board) were present and contributions of Dr. Sarabhai for various activities of DAE like establishment of Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, giving a boost to nuclear power stations, establishment of important organisations in DAE like Heavy Water Board, Electronics Corporation of India Limited, Nuclear Fuel Complex and Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre were highlighted. Dignitaries, who had close association with Dr. Sarabhai, reminisced their association with him. 

The programme is being followed with interaction with children on 18th October and is dedicated to children invited from various schools across Mumbai. Popular lectures on nuclear energy and space sciences, in addition to the Science Quiz and debate competitions and  speeches, are the major attractions of this day.

This curtain raiser is being followed by similar programmes in different units of DAE till August 2020.

Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, who is considered as the father of the Indian Space Programme, was born on 12th August 1919 in Ahmedabad. Contribution of Dr. Sarabhai towards Department of Space is well known. However, his contribution for Department of Atomic Energy in his capacity as Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission are equally important.

                Election Commission of India has started working on detailed guidelines and SoPs to facilitate the process of postal ballot paper for Absentee voters of essential services, Senior citizens of more than 80 years and marked PwD electors. These guidelines will include the identification of such voters, the manner of outreach, the methods of collection as well as voting in the specified centres in each constituency. The Commission is also taking a number of steps including personal contact under its SVEEP initiatives to make the electors aware of this new facility so that such electors can exercise their voting right in the manner they intend to do. The Commission had made a recommendation to the Union Government (Ministry of Law and Justice) on 2nd September, 2019 and is now in receipt of the requisite notification. 

It may be recalled that Election Commission has been laying special emphasis to ensure that the electors who are also Persons with Disabilities (PwD) and senior citizens are facilitated in every way to ensure their wider participation in the electoral process.  One of the standing items in the agenda for review by the Commission of the preparations of various States and UTs for the electoral process is facilitation of these categories besides other similarly placed categories. There are two aspects of this issue viz., the creation of requisite infrastructure and suitable legal framework to facilitate the process.  On the legal side, after studying the needs of those citizens, who are unable to come to the polling stations due to the degree of their disability as well as those who are left out their due to engagements in various capacities in the discharge of essential services e.g., railways, state transports and aviation etc.,  the Commission made the recommendation to Ministry of Law and Justice and on 22 October 2019, the Central Government amended the Rules accordingly.

Salient features of these amendments are as follows:


	A concept of ‘absentee voter’ has been introduced and defined for the elections;
	‘absentee voter’ means a person belonging to such class of persons as may be notified, under clause (c) of section 60 of the Act, and who is employed in essential services as mentioned in the said notification, and includes an elector belonging to the class of senior citizen or persons with disability [rule 27 A (aa)];
	‘person with disability’ means a person flagged as person with disability in the data base for the electoral roll;
	‘senior citizen’ for the purpose of this Part means an elector belonging to the class of absentee voters and is above 80 years of age; 
	In case of an absentee voter, the application shall be made in Form 12D, and shall contain such particulars as specified therein, and shall be duly verified by the Nodal Officer for the absentee voter, other than senior citizen or persons with disability, which shall reach the Returning Officer within five days following the date of notification of election;
	in the case of absentee voter, postal ballot paper shall be returned to the centre provided for recording of vote under sub-rule(3) of rule 27F, subject to any direction that may be issued by the Election Commission in this behalf.


These two categories of voters- senior citizen of more than 80 years of age and PwD electors marked in the electoral roll –will have now choice of voting either as absentee voter or as a regular voter on the poll day. If any of the electors belonging to these categories intends to vote early, then as per the amended Rule 27 C of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, he/she shall make an application in a new Form 12 D, which shall reach the Returning Officer within 5 days following the date of notification of election. After the receipt of such application, the elector will be issued a postal ballot paper, which shall be deposited in the specified centre after recording of vote.

    The Election Commission is committed to ensure the ease of voting to all such categories of electors. With this new initiative, the Commission is sure that the senior citizens of more than 80 years of age and the PwD electors will have the choice of exercising their right to franchise from their homes. However, such voters have both the choices available either voting through postal ballot by following due procedure or going to the polling station on polling day for voting to exercise their electoral rights in the largest democracy in the world.

Team ICT headed by Dr Sandeep Saxena, Sr Deputy Election Commissioner and others with Shri. Sunil Arora, Chief Election Commissioner, in front of the Election Trends TV Panel at Nirvachan Sadan, New Delhi

In a first, the Election Commission of India has deployed an integrated ICT counting application which gives freedom to Returning Officers spread across the country to directly compute and enter the result data on the ECI new counting application. This application allows the Returning Officers to enter table-wise data in the software, thereby considerably reducing the time and makes the results & trends data error-free. 

The counting software developed by the IT team of ECI called ENCORE (Enabling Communications on Real-time Environment) allows generation of various types of statutory reports during counting process which are mandatory for Returning Officers such as Form 20 Preparation/ Compilation of Final Result Sheet, 21C/D for Formal Declaration of Result and Form 21 E for Certificate of Return of Elections. The Returning Officer can download these system-generated reports after the counting is over and complete the statutory requirements in a hassle-free environment. 

For the first time, the Election Commission of India has launched Election Trends TV, on which the graphically-rich micro-details of trends & results are published in real-time. As and when the counting data of each round is entered after officially been declared by the Returning Officers, the data is displayed on the Election Trends TV, without any manual intervention using advanced secure technologies. These panels can be customized and configured, for display automatically in public places using large TV Panels by Returning Officers & Chief Electoral Officers. 

During today’s counting dissemination of trends and results are made with enhanced infographics and increased details through the ECI’s very popular mobile app ‘Voter Helpline App’ which is available from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for free download. The user can bookmark their favourite candidate and closely follow the results in a comprehensive manner.

                The Election Commission of India has replaced Police Observer of  Nashik and one RO of  Nashik district after reviewing the electoral preparedness of the state of Maharashtra.

Police Observer was removed for not performing the task of observation satisfactorily. On the basis of input regarding progress of photo voter slip distribution, which is very important to inform each and every elector timely, it was found that the performance of an Assembly Constituency in Nashik district was very poor. Reviewing this, the  Commission ordered replacement of the RO 125 Nashik West.  The new officers will join today.

According to the Union Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, State of Uttar Pradesh had the largest number of estimated MSMEs with a share of 14.20% of MSMEs in the country with around 89.99 lakh MSMEs operating in the State. 


	This sector is also a major source of employment in the State. The State needs to strengthen this sector, in their, requirement of credit, technology, raw material and marketing to encourage entrepreneurship, employment and livelihood opportunities and enhance the competitiveness of MSMEs in the changed economic scenario.


Tourism and Interlinked Sectors – Forward and Backward Linkages:

The State offers vast and unexploited potential for domestic tourists who, along with the foreign tourists, could contribute towards pushing the economic growth further, while providing employment opportunities.


	Tourism (pilgrimage) is vital sector for the State and economy of the State is based on sectors like tourism, handloom, handicraft, educational, hospitality, etc. For instance, 50% of economy of Varanasi city is dependent on tourism sector. These sectors are closely intertwined tend growth and employment are dependent on them  
	According to the Tourism Statistics of 2018, the State ranks third amongst all Indian States in attracting foreign tourists visits in the country (2017) and 13.2 percent of all foreign tourist visits were attracted by the State.
	The State ranks 2nd amongst all Indian States in attracting domestic tourists visits in the country in (2017) and 14.2 percent of all domestic tourist visits were attracted by the State.
	There is a need of launching of national image building and marketing plans in key sites of cultural and religious importance. These sitescan be used for building the Brand India for promoting tourism.


The Commission noted that the State of UP faces the number of typical challenges:


	Decreasing share of secondary sector in GSDP: During the period 2011-12 to 2017-18, the share of Secondary Sector in 2017-18 dropped to 22.8 percent from 26.7 percent in 2011-12. This may have strong implications on employment.
	Regional Backwardness: State has a large variation in terms of land, soil, rainfall and climate. Of the four regions (Western, Central, Eastern and Bundelkhand), the regions of Eastern and Bundelkhand lags far behind in the race of overall development in key sectors of power, industrial development and transport.



	Power is another sector which plays an important role in economic infrastructure. As per data of 2016-17, the per capita power consumption is lowest (239.82 Kwh) in Eastern region.
	Industrial development in the State is not uniform. The number of employees engaged in registered factories per lakh of population during 2013-14 was 101.19 in Bundelkhand while it was 110.80 in Eastern region. This indicates that both regions are backward in respect of Industrial development.
	Transport is another key sector for economic infrastructure. If the length of pucca road under P.W.D. on the basis of per thousand sq.km. of area is considered, the Eastern region occupies the top position with a figure of 1220.38 Km. while Bundelkhand region (498.35 Km.) is placed at the bottom.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the increase in the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for all mandated Rabi Crops of 2019-20 to be marketed in Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2020-21.

Benefits and Major Impact:

The increase in MSP for Rabi Crops for RMS 2020-21 is in line with the principle of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 1.5 times of the all India weighted average cost of production (CoP), which was announced in the Union Budget 2018-19.

This MSP policy whereby the farmers are assured of a minimum of 50 percent as margin of profit is one of the important and progressive steps towards doubling farmers' income by 2022 and improving their welfare substantively.

For the Rabi crops of RMS 2020-21, the highest increase in MSP has been recommended for lentil (Rs. 325 per quintal) followed by safflower (Rs. 270 per quintal) and gram (Rs. 255 per quintal) which is a major step towards increasing the income of farmers. 

The MSP of Rapeseed & Mustard has been increased by Rs. 225 per quintal. For both wheat and barley, the MSP has been increased by Rs. 85 per quintal. Wheat farmers will hence get a return over cost of 109 percent (refer table below).

Cost of production is one of the important factors in the determination of MSPs. This year's increase in MSP of Rabi crops for RMS 2020-21 provides higher than 50 per cent return (except safflower) over all India weighted average cost of production. The return over all India weighted average cost of production is 109 per cent for wheat; 66 per cent for barley; 74 per cent for gram: 76 per cent for lentil; 90% for rapeseed & mustard and 50 per cent for safflower.

* Refers to comprehensive cost which includes all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human It/hour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel electricity for operation of pump sets etc., miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour.

In the case of cereals, FCI and other designated State agencies would continue to provide price support to the farmers. State Governments will undertake procurement of coarse grains with the prior approval of Government and would distribute the entire procured quantity under NFSA. The subsidy will be provided only for the quantity issued under NFSA. NAFED, SFAC and other designated Central agencies would continue to undertake procurement of pulses and oilseeds. The losses, if any incurred by the nodal agencies in such operations may be fully reimbursed by the Government as per the guidelines.

With the intention of giving enough policy thrust to income security of the farmers, Government's focus has shifted from production-centric approach to income-centric one. Enhancing the coverage of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) to all farmers in its first Union Cabinet meeting on 31st May 2019, is another major step in boosting the income of the farmers. The PM-KISAN Yojana was announced in the interim Budget for the year 2019-2020, where the small and marginal landholder farmer families with cultivable land holding upto 2 hectare across the country were assured of Rs 6000 per year.

 

 

The new Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan” (PM-AASHA) announced by the government in 2018 will aid in providing remunerative return to farmers for their produce. The Umbrella Scheme consists of three sub-schemes i.e. Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Private Procurement &Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on a pilot basis.

In order to disseminate knowledge to farmers on optimum usage of fertilizer nutrients based on various parameters to sustain agricultural productivity and to make farmers aware of new developments in the field of fertilizer usage and management, the Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar along with Union Minister for Chemical and Fertilizers Shri D. V. SadanandaGowda jointly inaugurated the bi-annual Fertilizer Application Awareness Program at Pusa in New Delhi today. The event is organised jointly by both the Ministries before Kharif and Rabi season each year with the help of State Governments.

Addressing the huge gathering of farmers, Union Agriculture Minister Shri Tomar said today is a historic day for thousands of farmers present at Pusa and at the 714 Krishi VigyanKendras across the country who are watching the event live on a topic that is very pertinent and touches the lives of all citizens. He said that since Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has taken the charge in 2014, his efforts have been dedicated for the growth and betterment of gaon, gareeb,kisan. Shri Tomar further added that Prime Minister Shri Modi does not just think about how policies can be formulated for their betterment but also keeps thinking about how productivity, production and livestock improvements can be done for gaon, gareebkisans. He said that PM Shri Modi also dedicates his efforts and those of his government including all officers in that direction. 

The Union Agriculture Minister said that the farmers of India should be strong and prosperous and the land resources should be used in a sustainable manner to ensure its usage for the future generations.Shri Tomar further said that currently agriculture forms 14% of our Gross Domestic Product or GDP but it has a lot of potential and should be increased. He said that 50% of the entire population is dependent on agriculture for sustenance but all people are depending on it for its food needs and thereforeproduction, productivity and sustainability needs to be further improved. He emphasised that soil needs a balanced diet of Fertilizers, Micronutrients and Chemicals and too much of any can spoil the land and therefore it needs to be used optimally. 

Union Minister for Chemical and Fertilizers Shri D. V. SadanandaGowda in his address to farmers welcomed all the farmers and said though he is not very good in Hindi, he will for the first time attempt to address all in Hindi. Shri Gowda said that agriculture remains the mainstay for livelihood of rural India and fertilizers are the most vital inputs for agriculture to meet the food production requirement for the country. ShriGowda emphasized on proper conservation of soil as it is important forachieving the goal of food, nutrition, environmental and livelihood security.He urged for prompt conservation & management of soil to improve its sustainability. 

The Union Chemical & Fertilizer Minister mentioned about the variousUrea and Nutrient based subsidies that are being offered by the Government of India on the phosphatic and potassic fertilizers. He also stated that with an aim to overcome thedeficiency of micronutrients like zinc and boron, an additional subsidy is being given onthe fertilizers coated with zinc and boron. Shri Gowda urged various Departments along with ICAR Institutes and Agricultural Universities to contributetowards increasing and maintaining agricultural productivity.

Shri ParshottamRupala, Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfareapplauded the initiative for providing a platform for farmers to increasetheir awarenessabout the rightuse of fertilizers. The Minister urged to dub/translate variousagriculture-centric documentaries and films in the local and regional languages for the benefit of farmers across the nation. He said that this initiative would help the farmers more effectively.

There are many issues concerning Indian agriculture, which bears a direct relationship with the usage of Fertilizers.  Some of the issues with regard to usage of fertilizers which were discussed during the technical session are Imbalance in usage of major Plant Nutrients viz. N, P & K; Non-awareness of usage and deficiency of Nutrients other than N-P-K required by Soil (micronutrients); Declining response ratio of the soil to the fertilizer application (Inefficiency of fertilizers); Agronomical importance of low analysis fertilizers like Single Super Phosphate; Development of new type of fertilizers like liquid fertilizers, special compounds, bio-fertilizers, slow-release fertilizers etc.; Climatic zones, Soil types, quantity & method of fertilizers usage and suitability for crops; Long-term sustainability of agriculture; and Use of Soil health cards to get right amount and right type of fertilizers for each crop.

Two diagnostic kits developed by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) - Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) under the ‘Make in India’ initiative, namely the Bluetongue sandwich ELISA (sELISA) and the Japanese Encephalitis lgM ELISA kit for the control of Swine and Detection of Antigen, were released by Shri Atul Chaturvedi, Secretary Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying and Dr. T. Mahopatra, Secretary DARE and DG, ICAR at Krishi Bhawan today. This indigenous technology will not just help save foreign exchange as the newly developed kits cost ten times lesser than the imported ones but also has the potential to earn foreign exchange.          

Addressing the gathering, Dr. Trilochan Mohapatra briefed about the main characteristics of the two Kits. Talking about the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) ELISA Kit (IgM) for Swine, Dr. Mohapatra mentioned that the JE is a re-emerging viral zoonotic disease leading to death of children every year in the country. The kit developed by the ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute is really helpful for assessing the active infection of JE virus in the swine population which predicts the outbreak of JE in the humans. As compared to the commercial kit available in the market at a price of Rs. 52,000; the ICAR-IVRI developed is available for the farmers at a minimal price of Rs. 5,000 only. The Director General mentioned that each kit is meant for testing around 45 samples.

Highlighting the key features of another Kit “Bluetongue: Sandwich ELISA for detection of Antigen”, Dr. Mohapatra stated that the Bluetongue (BT) virus is an insect-transmitted viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants that includes the camelid species. The disease is widespread among the sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes and camels in the country. With the help of the Kit, the Bluetongue Virus can be controlled with the vaccination of susceptible animals, vector control and quarantine of infected animals with the good management practices. Apart from the vaccination, the early diagnosis and isolation of the infected animals are one of the commonly suggested preventive methods for controlling the spreading of the disease.

Shri Atul Chaturvedi applauded the joint initiative by the ICAR and the Department of Animal Husbandry as an incredible initiative. Shri Chaturvedi stated that release of these two Kits will definitely be beneficial for not only the farming community, but the society as a whole. Citing about the number of casualties caused by the deadliest diseases in the societies every year, the Secretary mentioned that the Kits will prove to be a real helping hand. 

Shri Sushil Kumar, Additional Secretary (DARE) & Secretary (ICAR) applauded the ICAR & Department of Animal Husbandry’s initiative in the designated direction. Shri Kumar stated that the kits have been prepared with care. He accentuated that proper research works by the scientists of both the organizations were carried out before the official launching of the Kits. The Kits were also tested against the mentioned virus and diseases caused by the animals for their validity.       

Dr. R.K. Singh, Director, Indian Veterinary Research Institute emphasized on the measures to be adopted for controlling the spread of various harmful diseases by the birds, pigs and other animals. He stressed that humans are more prone to the transmittable diseases. He expressed his concerns about the various cases in which the children are more affected by the diseases as compared to the younger or older ones. He mentioned that the Kits will provide help in achieving our targets effectively and efficiently.

In line with Government’s Start-up India and Stand-up India aimed at young entrepreneurs, Union Agriculture Minister Shri Narendra Singh Tomar to launch Yuva Sahakar-­Cooperative Enterprise Support and Innovation Scheme 2019 with an annual outlay of 100 crores

 

The first ever ‘India International Cooperatives Trade Fair’(IICTF) is going to be held at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi from 11th till 13thOctober, 2019. As 94% of total farmers in India are members of at least one cooperative institution,IICTF is aimed at furthering Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government’s vision and goal of doubling farmers’ income by promoting cooperative-to-cooperative trade within India & abroad and promoting exports of key agriculture commodities and products leading to enhanced rural and farm prosperity. IICTFalso offers a huge opportunity for the industry and business houses from India and abroad to build alliances, business networking, product sourcing and above all, interacting with the primary producers of a wide range of products and service providers.

The event has already garnered an overwhelming response both nationally and internationallyasmore than 120 Indian cooperatives and 20 organizations from Centre / State / UTs and as many as 35 countries from six continents having purchased exhibition booths for participating in IICTF. International organisations from Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bhutan, Brazil, China, Columbia, Fiji, Germany, Iran, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Russia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Senegal, Thailand, Tanzania, United States of America, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam will be showcasing the products.

In line with Government’s focus on programmes like Start-up India and Stand-up India aimed at young entrepreneurs with new and innovative ideas, National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) has formulated Yuva Sahakar ­Cooperative Enterprise Support and Innovation Scheme 2019 which will be launched at the opening ceremony of the fair on 11th October 2019 by Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar. The Scheme has an annual outlay of 100 crores. The Scheme is liberal to cooperatives in the North Eastern Region, cooperatives registered and operating in Aspirational Districts as identified by NITI Aayog, cooperatives with 100 % women/SC/ST/ PwD members. SahakarBharati, the single largest organisation focusing to enlighten the masses about the benefit of cooperative movement also plans to showcase and launch ‘Simplydesi’ brand at the inaugural of the Fair.

 

The cooperative sector has a formidable role in increasing agriculture exports from the present US $ 30 billion+ to US$ 60 billion+ by 2022 as envisaged in the Agriculture Exports Policy 2018.  IICTF is conceived as a major platform to promote exports of Indian cooperative produce and is packed with exhibitions, B2B/C2C meetings, conferences, cultural programmes etc. IICTF covers exhibitors / sellers / buyers from India and abroad focussing on sectors such as agriculture and its allied sectors’ complete value chains, cold chain, dairy, commodities, exports, technology, climate smart agriculture, processing, packaging, storage, machinery, brand promotion, marketing, cooperative banking, agri-tech and various other sectors. The Fair is expected to evolve a conducive environment for cooperative trade in the global arena, help in expansion and diversification of business, technology transfer, help lay international quality benchmark for cooperative products etc. Fair is also likely to result in sharing of best practices, collaborations and partnerships.  In the Indian context, the Fair would help more cooperatives to foray into exports and bring to the fore the cooperative visibility and its strength as a viable business model.

 

As an integral part of the IICTF, thematic sessions on cooperatives business will be held on all the three days of the Fair.  Nine sessions with cooperatives as the focus will cover various aspects viz. Globalisation of Cooperative Trade; Cooperative banking and financial inclusion; Empowerment of youth and women through cooperatives; Agro processing-eco systems through cooperatives; Agri-tech and climate smart agriculture through cooperatives; Cooperatives as cost effective and efficient service providers; Big data and cyber security in cooperative sector; Dairy cooperatives-opportunities for value addition and trade;  and Farm mechanisation and inputs supply-role of cooperatives. The sessions would be chaired by eminent personalities and a panel of distinguished resource persons. The sessions would provide an insight on the role of agriculture cooperatives and their expected contribution in light of the Agriculture Export Policy of India.  It would also provide a platform for cross learning particularly in the current scenario of digitisation. 

The Fair is jointly organised by NCDC in association with the Bangkok based international organization (NEDAC) and leading organizations in India (NAFED, APEDA, ITPO etc.) with the support of Ministries of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Commerce and Industry and External Affairs. Six State Governments/UTs, namely, Telangana, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Puducherry, Meghalaya and Goa are partners of IICTF. IICTF is also supported through partnership with IFFCO, IPL, AMUL, CDB, UPL, FAO, NCUI, LINAC, NAFCUB, NAFSCOB, NCCD etc.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the relaxation of the mandatory requirement of Aadhaar Seeded data as a pre-condition for release of funds to the beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri KisanSamman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) scheme.

The scheme provides income support of Rs 6,000 per year to landholding families, subject to certain exclusions. The amount is released in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs 2,000 each directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT mode.

Under this scheme, after 1st August, 2019, release of 3rd Instalment onwards to those beneficiaries who got first instalment during December, 2018 - March, 2019 and 2nd instalment during April-July, 2019 is to be made only on the basis of Aadhaar seeded database. Similarly, after 1st August, 2019, release of 2nd instalment onwards to those who got 1st instalment during April-July, 2019 is to be made only on the basis of Aadhaar seeded database. Again, after 1st August, 2019, release of 1st instalment onwards to the rest of the beneficiaries after 1st August, 2019 is to be made only on the basis of Aadhaar seeded database. Farmers in the States of Assam, Meghalaya and J&K, where there has not been enough Aadhaar penetration, have been exempted from this requirement till 31.3.2020.

However, it has not been possible to get 100% Aadhaar seeding for release of funds as per the prescribed time schedule before release of instalments after 1st August, 2019. Since the farmers are still gearing up for Rabi season, they are in dire need of money to take care of various farming activities like procurement of seeds, preparation of soil and other associated activities like irrigation, maintenance and mobilization of machinery and tools. Over and above these pressing needs, the just started festive season will put further stress on the financial condition of the poor farmers' households in the country. Non-seeding of beneficiaries' details with Aadhaar number will delay the release of further instalments and will cause discontentment among the farmers. Therefore, the mandatory requirement of Aadhaar seeding for release of benefits after 1st August, 2019 has been relaxed till 30th November, 2019. This will enable immediate release of benefits to a large number of farmers who are not able to avail the same due this requirement. This mandatory requirement will remain applicable for release of benefits w.e.f. 1st December, 2019 onwards. The Government will take adequate measures to validate the data before payment is made.

Background:

 

The Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri KisanSamman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) provides income support to land-holding farmers' families, subject to certain exclusions, by way of payment of Rs.6000/- per year. The amount is released in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs.2000 /- each directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT mode. A total amount of more than Rs.27000 crores has already been released under the scheme through the 1st instalment to 6,76,76,073 beneficiaries, 2nd instalment to 5,14,27,195 beneficiaries and 3rd instalment to 1,74,20,230 beneficiaries.

                Minister for Shipping and Minister of State for Chemicals & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh Mandaviya has said that Neurological disorders pose a great challenge to the healthcare in developing countries in view of limited resources and manpower that are in adequate to tackle the increasing burden. He was addressing International Conference on Neurological Disorders and Therapeuticsorganized by NIPER-Ahmedabad at Gandhinagar, Gujarat, today.

Shri Mansukh Mandaviya hoped that the conference would help to explore and encourage approaches to stimulate new ideas for research and treatment that will be beneficial across the spectrum of neurological disorders. 

This will create a cross fertilization between basic neuroscientists and clinical neurologists who rarely see each other and get people thinking about how both can help society by contributing to a common aim of treating different neurological disorders effectively. Today India is largest exporter of generic drugs globally and it has been predicted that the number is going to rise in coming periods, the minister said.

He said the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers has achieved the goal to bring the collaboration between industry and institutes like National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), for a symbiotic relationship. 

The minister pointed out that Global Burden of Disease studyby the World Bank and the Harvard School of Public Health, drew the attention of the international health community to the burden of neurological disorders.

 This study found that the burden of neurological disorders was seriously underestimated by traditional epidemiological and health statistical methods that consider only mortality rates but not disability rates.On one hand clinical treatment of such diseases are important, on the other hand lifestyle changes & naturopathy &traditional Indian ayurvedic system of yoga may also provide solutions, Shri Mandaviya said.

International Conference on Neurological Disorders and Therapeutics -ICNDT-2019 is going to foster cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas and expertise to help in deciphering different unexplored mysteries of neuroscience.

He hoped that the conference would provide a meaningful experience for allparticipants, especially the young generation to be able to interact and learn fromthe neuroscience experts around the world who are attending this conference.

                “Aviation is undergoing a revolution and the pace of technological advancement is providing both opportunities and challenges. It has been our effort to ensure that policy fundamentals are contemporary, and that technology acts as an enabler and catalyst for growth.  Expanding use of unmanned Aircraft Systems (Drones) is one such example.  India is favourably placed to be a leader in this sector and serve as a model for balancing the opportunities that drones bring for social and economic development with the obligation to maintain public safety and security. Responsible use is the way forward.”  Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State(I/c) for Civil Aviation, Housing & Urban Affairs said delivering the Keynote Address at the Drone Innovators Network Summit-2019, here today.

 

The summit organised by the World Economic Forum under the aegis of the Ministry of Civil Aviation saw participation from National & International Aviation Regulatory bodies, Drone Industry and senior Civil Aviation Ministry officials. 



The minister further added “India is one the few countries to come out with drone regulations. India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR), effective 1 December, 2018 for drones. As per the regulations, manufacturers of drone are required to comply with the requirements of No Permission, No Take-off (NPNT) on the Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS). These regulations (CAR Version 1.0) only permit operations of drones during daytime Visual Line of Sight. While we appreciate, and understand immense commercial and social applications that a drone can provide, at the same time, however, we are also aware of the destructive nature of the technology. We have, therefore, developed a system in which each of the operators of drones is recognised and tracked so as to have secure and safe drone operations. To support exponential growth of the drone technology adoption, India will require a strong technology platform for governance of Drones.”

 

NPNT is a software programme that enables every Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) (except Nano) to obtain a valid permission through the DigiSky platform before operating in India. OEMs/Manufacturers are to comply with this requirement. The DigiSky is a portal for registration and flying of civil drones in India.  The purpose of DigiSky is to create a digital, paperless process, thus providing on-demand seamless permissions for UAS/RPAS, operators, and pilots. The RPAS are embedded with encrypted firmware by the manufacturer to receive permissions through ‘DigiSky’ each time before take-off.  This platform will also eventually enable Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management (UTM) functions. “No drone zones” are to be geo-fenced into the DigiSky platform and the NPNT code will activate the “Return to Home” function in the drone and the same shall be recorded in the Digital Recorded Path. In case the drone deviates from its path or enters a no drone area, it will automatically return to home. 

 

The Summit saw various stakeholders sharing ideas on the best path forward to maximize the benefits of emerging drone technology while protecting society from the risks.

Commerce & Industry Minister proposed the setting up of an Investment Enclave for Swedish investors in India with ready plug and play infrastructure that will help in creating an enabling ecosystem for Swedish companies in India, which was well received by the Swedish side. Both sides also agreed for greater cooperation between the Start-up ecosystems of both countries.

The Indian and Swedish sides complemented the Investment Facilitation Mechanism implemented through Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade and Invest India in coordination with the Embassy of Sweden which has successfully resolved issues being faced by many Swedish companies in India.

The Swedish Minister welcomed India’s offer to participate in the opportunities mentioned by Commerce and Industry Minister, including the Investment Enclave and looked forward to working together on innovative and smart solutions for improving the lives of people of both countries.

In addition, GeM is contemplating the creation of EMD pool account for making it easy for sellers to comply with the EMD requirements while responding to bids.

                Commerce and Industry & Railways Minister, Piyush Goyal addressed the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) in New Delhi today. During the interaction Piyush Goyal said that Indo-US relationship is at their best ever now and trade relations between the two countries have a huge potential which is yet to be tapped. India and the US must look at a much larger agreement like a bilateral agreement said the Commerce and Industry Minister.

With regards to the trade talks between India and the US, Commerce and Industry Minister said that things are on the right track and India is looking to the US for technology, innovation, skills and quality education. India on the other hand offers an attractive market to US businesses and skilled labour that can add value to American companies.

Commerce and Industry Minister informed the Forum that the Commerce and Industry Ministry is working to create a single window for investments into India and he welcomed innovative ideas and solutions for the creation of this single window. He also informed the gathering that the Department of Commerce is also working to bring down the cost of logistics that have to be borne by manufacturing companies in India.

According to USISPF estimates India-US bilateral trade is projected to grow to USD 238 billon by 2025. The assessment underscores the pathways for growth and economic opportunities in bilateral ties by highlighting current trends. Sectors like defence trade, commercial aircrafts, oil and LNG, coal, machinery and electronics are areas of potential growth in US investments and commerce into India. Indian industry has an opportunity to promote automotive, pharmaceuticals, seafood, IT and travel services to the US market.

60 Indian Companies in M&E sector participating in MIPCOM 2019 in Cannes

 

Services Exports Promotion Council (SEPC), set-up by the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, has brought out the India Intellectual Property (IP) Guide at Cannes in MIPCOM 2019, being held from 14-17, October 2019, for the Media and Entertainment (M&E) industry. The guide features a catalogue of over 60 Indian IPs, popular in over 160 countries. It comprehensively breaks the narrative of only low-end work being done in India.

In a message, to the industry in the India IP Guide released at 36th MIPCOM at Cannes, Commerce Secretary, Anup Wadhawan, said that the Government of India is committed to safeguard against infringement of originality and creativity of the makers to give a boost to services exports. IP is the most important asset for its creators in the media and entertainment sector and the message by Commerce Secretary further said that India firmly believes in the significance of IPR as the centrepiece of the industry’s future growth.

For the second consecutive year, SEPC's India Pavilion at MIPCOM, Cannes, France, the world's largest content market, has enthused and attracted industry. Over 60 Indian delegates are part of the India Pavilion delegation. Over 115 Indian companies comprising over 250 delegates are at MIPCOM.

Sangeeta Godbole, Director General, SEPC informed that some of the top renowned Indian Media and Entertainment companies are present at MIPCOM. Exhibition space has been increased over last year and 15 media and companies are participating for the first-time through the SEPC delegation at the India Pavilion, she said.

The Indian exhibitors and visiting companies are participating to buy, sell, serve and partner with companies present at MIPCOM from over 111 countries across the world. India Pavilion is the one-stop place to meet content creators, audio visual service providers in animation, VFX, AR/VR, gaming, new media services, film production services and much more.  Many of the Indian companies are here with their completed IPs or pitch for their in-production properties.

One of the key objectives at SEPC is to facilitate service exporters of India and handhold medium and small enterprises to expand their global footprint and to present IPs from India to the buyers and distributors from across the globe. The IP Guide is to illustrate strengths of the Indian content creators.

Intellectual Property (IP), especially in the innovation economy of today, is vital to a large number of SEPC's stakeholders. Creation, protection and expansion of IP products alone will bring huge benefits to the sector, informed Sangeeta Godbole.

In the coming months, SEPC plans to launch an online IP helpline, so that anybody who has simple questions can get feedback on IP related queries. SEPC will also be setting up a committee to help small and medium entertainment companies to navigate critical aspects of IP creation. The aim is to assist companies and content creators to maximise the value that IPs can provide.

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal addressedthe curtain raiser event in New Delhi today for the 5thWorld Coffee Conference (WCC)& Expo to be held in Bengaluru from September 7-12, 2020.  This is the first time that the World Coffee Conference and Expo will be held in Asia. 

During his address Commerce and Industry Minister urged the Coffee Board of India and the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to bring in innovation to the conference and expo by crowd sourcing ideas from citizens. He further urged ICO and Coffee Board of India to look at ways that will make Indian coffee a brand that is recognised worldwide andformulate ways to make India a sustainable destination for coffee.

Commerce and Industry Minister also said that methods may be explored to make coffee farmers stakeholders in the value chain as this will have a positive impact on the 25 million families who depend on coffee cultivation the world over. TheMinister suggested that a rupee may be added to every cup of coffee that is bought all over the world by coffee lovers and this can be given to the coffee growers,to make a positive impact on the lives of coffee growers and their families. 

Commerce and Industry Minister said that the Government of India and the Government of Karnataka will extend full co-operation for the success of the 5thWorld Coffee Conference (WCC)& Expo to be held in Bengaluru from September 7-12, 2020. This is a great opportunity that India has got and the Coffee Board of India will welcome to India participants from more than 70 countries for the Expo and Conference, said the Minister. 

During this year long period of preparation, Piyush Goyal urged the ICO to commission studies that will assuage concerns regarding the harmful effects of caffeine.

The World Coffee Conference & Expo in Bengaluru is expected to be attended by delegates of all 76 member countries of the ICO and over 1000 attendees, including coffee growers, exporters, representatives from government, private sectors and international agencies. 

India will be hosting the WCC 2020 as it is the 5th largest export and producer in the coffee in the world and is emerging as the major coffee consuming country. The Government of India has also a strong focus on increasing coffee plantation. The global community also desires to connect with coffee growers in India and Asia and WCC 2020 offers an opportunity to explore India and Asia to the global coffee community. Bengaluru is the coffee capital of India and produces nearly 70% of India’s coffee

The proposed theme of WCC 2020 is sustainably through consumption because the world coffee production is increasing and having a negative impact on coffee prices, this can be offset by increasing consumption, therefore consumption is the key to sustainability. The focus will be on economic, agriculture, commercial, environmental, social and cultural impact. 
Minister @PiyushGoyal spoke at the Curtain Raiser for the 5th World Coffee Conference and acknowledged the tireless efforts of the coffee farmer, elaborating on ways to support them.Watch here: https://t.co/bEELq0F81wRead more about it:https://t.co/KNf0Pgmqjl pic.twitter.com/jIQ0cGAqL9— Piyush Goyal Office (@PiyushGoyalOffc) October 15, 2019

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal participated in the 3rd edition of India Energy Forum2019by CERAWeek in New Delhi today. Piyush Goyal was part of the Indian Ministerial panel along with R. K. Singh, Minister for New and Renewable Energy and Pralhad Joshi, Minister of Coal and Mines. The discussions were conducted by Daniel Yergin, Pulitzer prize winning author, speaker and energy expert. 

During the discussions Commerce and Industry Minister said that India has naturally emerged as the startup capital of the world with the highest registered startups and he applauded the suo moto decision of the oil PSUs, under the Petroleum Ministry, to set up a startup fund that will encourage Indians to innovate and set up their own companies. Piyush Goyal further said that India will soon become the innovation capital of the world and informed that during his interactions with young innovators, even in the remote parts of the country, youngsters come forth with bright ideas to solve number of economic and social problems that prevail in India today. He said that he is extremely proud of the young girls and boys who are the driving force behind the startup revolution taking place in India today.

Commerce and Industry Minister further said that he is not worried about the state of the world in this time of trade wars as thesewere issues waiting to be addressed. He further added that countries of the world cannot develop when few countries are giving subsidies and nurturing an eco system of unfair trade and competition among industries.Itis the need of the hour to have a more balanced development across the world and distributed sources of wealth creation, said Piyush Goyal. There is need for free trade but there is greater need for fair trade said Commerce and Industry Minister as this will work in the interests of all countries and India supports the new dynamics of world trade. He further said that multilateralism will prevail and India supports all fair and honest global efforts to do away with all unfair trade practices. He further informed that India will continue to support those countries that are struggling to get manufacturing back to their own countries and hoped that the existing system of prosperous countries outsourcing their pollution and emission to the developing world, in the garb of creating jobs but in reality ruining the health of the population and destroying the future prosperity of the citizens by outsourcing problems to developing countries, must stop immediately. 

Piyush Goyal also informed that by 2023 Indian railways will be fully electrified and by 2030 the Indian Railways will use only renewable and clean energy. He hoped that there will be more FDI in the energy sector as 100% FDI is allowed in this sector and there is requirement of around 70 billion USD investment in India’s energy sector which is on the cusp of a revolution as there is great demand for energy in India because the country hopes to achieve self-sufficiency in domestic production of the energy requirements for every household. During this interaction he further informed that the India - US relations are robust with great potential to move forward and it is time for India - US relations to make a quantum leap if tradebetween the two countries has to reach half trillion USD. 

India is the third largest energy consumer in the world in absolute terms, after the United States, but per capita energy consumption is very low. There is need for a healthy mix of all commercial energy sources and India is today on the path of energy transition where 95% of households have access to electricity in the country today but there is increasing demand for energy which has to be fulfilled if India has to achieve the target of 450 megawatts set by Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.

During the India Energy Forum delegates from Indian and regional energy companies, institutions and governments participated in various sessions related to the energy sectorin New Delhi from October 13-15, 2019.

Minister @PiyushGoyal attended the India Energy Forum 2019 and spoke about the roadmap for India becoming self-sufficient in domestic energy production through investments in eco-friendly & modern technology.https://t.co/14NXgwhFpY pic.twitter.com/KiOmqKV5FO— Piyush Goyal Office (@PiyushGoyalOffc) October 15, 2019

                Secretary Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Guruprasad Mohapatra launched the website and mobile application [Learn to Protect, Secure and Maximize Your Innovation] on Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) today in New Delhi. The website and app has been developed by Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM)-DPIIT in collaboration with Qualcomm and National Law University (NLU), Delhi.

 

Speaking on this occasion, Secretary DPIIT said that it is an important project taken up by the Department as both the website and app will be very useful to the startup community which holds great promise for India and its economy. Startups are more tuned into investment and risk taking but lack legal knowledge and today when we are on the threshold of the fourth industrial revolution the interface between technology and law is growing and therefore it is very essential that a specialised website and app is available to help startups with the IP process, added Secretary DPIIT. 

 

The modules of this e-learning platform [L2Pro India IP e-learning Platform and the L2Pro India Mobile App] will aid and enable youth, innovators, entrepreneurs and small and medium industries (SMEs) in understanding IPRs for their ownership and protection, integrate IP into business models and obtain value for their R&D efforts. The L2Pro has been successfully implemented in Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and France, benefiting immensely from close collaboration with respective IP organizations and public research institutions. The learning app has been customized for India in order to ensure that innovation which is fundamental to startups are protected, managed and commercialised. 

 

The L2Pro India IP e-learning platform will have 11 modules for three different levels: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. Each module comprises of e-text for understanding concepts, short animated videos of the concepts, links to additional resources on the subject and quizzes for assessment and grading the learner’s knowledge and understanding of the subject. Learners will access the L2Pro IP e-learning platform through their desktop, laptop, mobile browser and mobile application (available on Android & iOS), and will be provided e-certificates by CIPAM-DPIIT and NLU Delhi and Qualcomm on successful completion of the e-learning modules. 

 

For the launch of the website and mobile app Alex Rogers, Executive Vice President at Qualcomm, Prof. Ranbir Singh, Vice Chancellor of NLU, Delhi and other senior officials of DPIIT and CIPAM were present.

This will be the last Ministerial before the 3rdLeaders Summit to be held on November 4th 2019 in Bangkok. The Prime Minister of India is expected to attend the Summit. The 9th Intersessional Ministerial Meeting comes at a crucial stage where the RCEP is scheduled to be announced as concluded in November 2019.

The 28thround of negotiations for RCEP at the expert level had concluded at Da Nang, Vietnam, held from September 19 – 27, 2019. In this round of negotiations meeting of the Trade Negotiating Committee was held in which senior officials participated in negotiations regarding market access on Trade in Goods, Trade in Services and Investment as well as on other areas like Rules of Origin, Intellectual Property and Electronic Commerce. Out of 25 chapters 21 chapters have been concluded. Crucial chapters of Investment, Electronic Commerce, Rules of Origin and Trade Remedies are yet to be settled.

Commerce and Industry Minister chaired several inter-ministerial meetings at the official level and also with Ministers of the key line Ministries. 

The focus and emphasis of the meetings chaired by the Commerce and Industry Minister was on putting in place appropriate safeguards including auto-trigger mechanism against sudden surge in imports from RCEP countries. 

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with six partners namely People’s Republic of China (ACFTA), Republic of Korea (AKFTA), Japan (AJCEP), India (AIFTA) and Australia and New Zealand (AANZFTA).

In order to broaden and deepen the engagement among parties and to enhance their participation in economic linkages and to enhance trade and investment related activities as well as to contribute to minimising development gap among the parties the 16 Economic Ministers of countries in this region endorsed the Guiding Principles and Objective for Negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in August 2012.

The RCEP negotiations were launched by leaders from 10 ASEAN member states (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) and 6 ASEAN FTA partners (Australia, People’s Republic of China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and New Zealand).

The objective of launching RCEP negotiation is to achieve a modern, comprehensive, high quality and mutually beneficial economic partnership agreement among the ASEAN member states and ASEAN’s FTA partners. The RCEP negotiations commenced in early 2013.

                India and Bangladesh are not competitors but collaborators in making both countries prosperous and ensuring a better future for their people said the Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal at the India - Bangladesh Business Forum held in New Delhi today. The Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, was also present in the India - Bangladesh Business Forum meeting.

Piyush Goyal urged Indian industry to be part of Bangladesh’s growth story with greater investment in infrastructure, technology and energy where Bangladesh has huge potential. This will help to create more balanced trade between the two countries added Piyush Goyal. 

Commerce & Industry and Railways Minister assured the visiting Prime Minister that India stands committed to every request that Bangladesh has in railways sector because the connectivity that the expansion in railways will bring to both countries will boost trade and also give greater and smoother access to the North East region of India. 

Bangladesh Prime Minister thanked the Government of India and the three Chambers of Commerce and Industry for giving this opportunity to the Bangladesh Government and Industry to interact with Indian business heads. Bangladesh Prime Minister informed that three Special Economic Zones have been set up in Bangladesh for Indian investors and hoped that this will broaden the export base of Bangladesh.

On this occasion two Government to Business (G2B) MoUs were signed between Start up Bangladesh and Tech Mahindra and Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority and Adani Ports and SEZs. 

Bangladesh is India’s biggest trade partner in South Asia. Bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh has grown steadily over the last decade. India’s exports to Bangladesh for the financial year 2018-19 (April-March) stood at USD 9.21 billion and imports from Bangladesh for the same period stood at USD 1.22 billion.

India and Bangladesh have trade agreement which is facilitative in nature. India and Bangladesh are members of various regional trade agreements including the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), SAARC Preferential Trade Agreement (SAPTA) and the Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) which govern the tariff regimes for trade. Under SAFTA, India has granted duty free quota free access to Bangladesh on all items except alcohol and tobacco. Various bilateral institutional mechanisms including Commerce Secretary Level Meeting, Shipping Secretary Level Talks, Joint Working Groups on Trade, Customs and Fisheries and Sub-groups on Banking and LCS/ICP Infrastructure meet regularly.

Four Border Haats, two each in Tripura (Srinagar and Kamalasagar) and Meghalaya (Kalaichar and Balat), have been established for the benefit of communities living along the border areas of both countries. Ten additional Border Haats on the India-Bangladesh border are under implementation.

Cumulative Foreign Direct Investment from India to Bangladesh has more than doubled from USD 243.91 million in 2014 to USD 570.11 million in December 2018. Indian companies have invested in various sectors including telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, FMCG and automobiles sectors in Bangladesh. During Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina’s visit in April 2017, 13 agreements worth around USD 10 billion of Indian investment mainly in power and energy sectors in Bangladesh were signed.

Bangladesh is the biggest development partner of India today. India has extended 3 Lines of Credits (LOCs) to Bangladesh in the last 8 years amounting to USD 8 billion.

In addition to LOCs, the Government of India has also been providing grant assistance to Bangladesh for various infrastructure projects such as the Agartala- Akhaura rail link, dredging of inland waterways, India Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, and High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs) in the areas of education, health, water, culture, urban development, disaster management and community welfare.

                The Union Cabinet today approved the proposal for revival of BSNL and MTNL by administrative allotment of spectrum for 4G services, debt restructuring by raising of bonds with sovereign guarantee, reducing employee costs, monetisation of assets and in-principle approval of merger of BSNL & MTNL.

The following was approved by the cabinet:-


	Administrative allotment of spectrum for 4G services to BSNL and MTNL so as to enable these PSUs to provide broadband and other data services. The said Spectrum will be funded by the Government of India by capital infusion in these PSUs at a value of Rs 20,140 Cr in addition; the GST amount of Rs 3,674 Cr to this spectrum value will also be borne by the Government of India through Budgetary resources. By using this spectrum allotment, BSNL and MTNL will be able to deliver 4G services, compete in the market and provide high speed data using their vast network including in rural areas.


 


	BSNL and MTNL will also raise long-term bonds of Rs 15,000 Cr for which sovereign guarantee will be provided by the Government of India (GoI). With the said resources, BSNL and MTNL will restructure their existing debt and also partly meet CAPEX, OPEX and other requirements.


 


	BSNL and MTNL will also offer Voluntary Retirement to their employees, aged 50 years and above through attractive Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), the cost of which will be borne by the Government of India through budgetary support. The ex-gratia component of VRS will require Rs. 17,169 Cr in addition, GoI will be meeting the cost towards Pension, Gratuity and Commutation. Details of the scheme will be finalised by BSNL/MTNL. 


 


	BSNL and MTNL will monetise their assets so as to raise resources for retiring debt, servicing of bonds, network upgradation, expansion and meeting the operational fund requirements.


 


	In-principle merger of BSNL and MTNL


 

It is expected that with the implementation of said revival plan, BSNL and MTNL will be able to provide reliable and quality services through its robust telecommunication network throughout the country including rural and remote areas.

Horticulture Commissioner has been asked to write to Andhra Pradesh Horticulture Commissioner asking him to dispatch the fresh Tomatoes immediately for augmenting supplies in major demand centres including Delhi NCR. 


 


	Mother Dairy has agreed to sell Tomatoes at not more than Rs. 55 per kilogram. Mother Dairy/Safal were also advised to consider repacking the Tomato Puree packets of 800 grams that are available with them into smaller packets of 100/200 grams for wider consumption and retailing at all their outlets. It was also informed that sufficient supply of Tomato Puree is available for retailing.


 


	It was informed by representatives of Agriculture Ministry that prices of Tomatoes have normalised in most States barring a few States. The arrivals from Madhya Pradesh have begun which will have an immediate easing impact on prices.


 


	The Tomato crop in Karnataka has begun arriving in the mandis and this will have an immediate impact on prices especially in the Southern region. There has been no damage to the crop as it’s a highland area and prices have already begun showing a downward trend.

They felt that Hindi has the potential to replace English in India as it is most widely used and is easily understood. 

The Union Minister said that India’s culture, tradition and language are all its heritage. He said that English was in fact the last language to come to India and it was introduced by the British to all their erstwhile colonies. Shri Paswan urged all officials and employees to promote Hindi and use it as much as possible in their day to day affairs. The Union Minster also suggested that there should be a Hindi cell which can ensure that all the work in the Ministry is being done/translated in Hindi.  

The Minister expressed happiness that the overall usage of Hindi has increased in the Ministry and congratulated all the employees for this. He urged them to keep up the momentum and use simple Hindi and not very ‘klisht’ or complicated Hindi as it becomes difficult to understand. He said that this is one of the hindrance people face and therefore it is important to use simple words that are easily understandable.

The Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs, Shri Avinash K Srivastava congratulated all the winners and emphasised on the importance of usage of Hindi in official work. He said that it is a matter of pride that the participation rate in the Hindi Pakhwada has been continuously rising.

Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswan inaugurated the celebrations of ‘World Standard Day’ by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) on the theme “Video Standards create a global stage” in New Delhi today. The theme is highly relevant in the Indian context as India is the fastest growing entertainment and media market globally and is expected to keep up the momentum by growing at a compounded annual growth rate of more than 11%. With this spectacular growth, media and entertainment industry in India will become a Rs. 4,51,373 crore industry by 2023.

Delivering his Presidential address, Union Minister Shri Ram Vilas Paswan congratulated everyone on the occasion of 60th ‘World Standards Day’ and appreciated the efforts of all officials of BIS and said that we have some of the best laboratories in the world. The Minister encouraged that BIS must take the lead in making global standards & benchmarks and it should look for ways and means to become synonymous with trust and quality. Shri Paswan said that he has been closely monitoring the work of BIS in minute details and it is quite important on multiple levels but their work does not get the appreciation it rightly deserves. The Minister asked officials to suitably highlight their work and also spread more awareness among the masses about BIS and quality products.

Talking about Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of providing tap water to all households by 2024 Shri Paswan said that BIS, which sets quality standards for piped water, has a huge role to play in this regard. The Minister talked about the quality of Delhi water and said that the Ministry is awaiting the final report of the 11 samples collected from various places in Delhi and once the report is out it will be made public. Shri Paswan said that it is the right of every citizen to get clean drinking water and asserted that nobody, especially the poor people who do not have access to water filters, should fall ill or become victims of water borne diseases. He further said that the Ministry will come out with Water Quality Rankings beginning with 100 Smart Cities and all State Capitals in the next 3 months and this will be extended to all districts in 6 months. Shri Paswan said that access to clean drinking water will become a popular movement. The Minister further said that he has written to all State Chief Ministers to make drinking water Standards mandatory for tap water.

Shri Paswan also spoke about how BIS should create Standards that are strong and perfect. Taking the example of the Election Commission and how it curtailed the use of Money and Muscle power in Elections and improved its own stature and independence, Shri Paswan exhorted BIS to work on similar lines. The Minister said that during Diwali a lot of sub-standard products enter the Indian market and our standards are not being implemented and that we should together work out a way for taking things forward for making Indian Standards valuable. 

Delivering the keynotes address Secretary, Consumer Affairs Shri Avinash K Srivastava highlighted the road map for BIS including ‘One Nation One Standard’, working on reducing ‘Single Use Plastic’, enforcing standards for piped drinking water, implementing Gold Hallmarking etc. Shri Srivastava congratulated all the scientists who have been promoted in BIS and said that it was a long pending demand which has now been fulfilled and further assured all other scientists that their hard work and determination will continue to be rewarded by the Government.

The Director General of BIS, Shri Rohit Kumar Parmar delivering the welcome address after the lamp lighting ceremony said Standardisation of products play a key role. He said that the theme of the 60th World Standards Day is very relevant as mobile phones and other electronic devices and IT has boosted video production and it is estimated that by 2020, 80% of all internet traffic will be consumed by ‘Video Streaming Data’. There will be technical sessions and panel discussions later in the day which will be an enriching experience for the participants with many eminent speakers addressing them.

                The Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs today chaired an inter-ministerial meeting to take stock of the rise in prices of Tomatoes in some parts of the country including Delhi-NCR. The following key decisions have been taken to ensure that price rise is contained:


	The representatives of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare informed that supply has been hit due to incessant rains in Maharashtra and Karnataka and it will normalize in the next 10 days as monsoon rains are already receding. 



	To mitigate the shortfall in availability of Tomatoes in Delhi, Safal has agreed to provide Tomato puree from all its outlets in Delhi at Rs. 25 per 200 gram pack which is equivalent to about 800 grams of Tomatoes. Another larger pack worth 825 grams worth Rs. 85 will also be made available which is equivalent to about 2.5 Kgs of Tomatoes. The stocks have already been moved to all the outlets and the sales will begin from tomorrow (11th October, 2019) onwards at all booths.
	
	Tomato producing States will be requested to facilitate augmenting the supply from their respective States to regions which are in short supply including Delhi to improve availability and moderate prices. Tomato producing States have been regularly advised to interact with APMCs, Traders and Transporters to ensure regular supply. The same is being reiterated to 4 major Tomato producing States namely, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh so that prices normalize and supply is augmented immediately.

The Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswan today made a clarion call for beginning a ‘Swachh PaniAbhiyaan’ or clean water mission in line with Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’. Shri Paswanasserted that it is not a matter of consumer rights but of people’s lives and therefore must be given priority. Shri Paswan stated that it is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to provide piped Drinking water to all households by 2024 and for furthering this vision and mission, he has started this Abhiyaan which has begun from Delhi and will be taken across the nation. 

The Union Minister chaired a meeting with officials of Bureau of India Standards (BIS), Delhi Jal Board (DJB), officials from Ministry of Jal Shakti &Department of Consumer Affairs and FSSAI where it was discussed that the Standards for Drinking Water which are being set by BIS must be made mandatory which are currently voluntary in nature and only then can they be enforced.

BIS informed during the meeting that it had collected samples from 11 places from Delhi region and tested them on 42 parameters such as PH levels, Odour, Metal content, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and all samples failed to meet the BIS standard on multiple parameters. Shri Paswan said it is the responsibility of DJB to provide clean drinking water to all residents of Delhi and people are facing numerous issues due to this.  

Shri Paswan directedBIS officials to collect samples from State Capitals and compile the results by November, 2019 itself. The process of collecting samples from State Capitals including Delhi has already begun. BIS will be conducting a test of all the water samples for which teams have been deployed. 

Addressing the media after the meeting, Shri Paswan said that BIS has been asked to write letters to all States including Delhi and also to concerned officials from various Ministries to create a consensus among them regarding making the standards mandatory.This is an important matter that touches the lives of all citizens and especially children who are most vulnerable. 

Shri Paswan exhorted the media to make a ‘Jan Aandolan’ or a people’s movement out of this initiative of the Ministry. The Minister also asked for research to be done to create basic testing kits which can be easily used and understood by all people that will help them ascertain whether the water is clean enough to drink or not.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented first National Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Awards to selected companies here today. The President conferred national awards to winning companies in two categories namely, “Corporate Award for Excellence in CSR” and “Contribution of CSR in Challenging Circumstances”. 

In his address, President Shri Ram Nath Kovind observed that through National CSR Awards companies are being recognised for their contribution to society. Such contribution through CSR is a true manifestation of the trusteeship philosophy of Father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. He also noted that the award assume greater significance since these are being presented in the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He stated that CSR has now become an integral part of business philosophy such that companies also carry activities which directly benefit the poor and needy including women, people with special abilities, rural areas, slums, etc. The President congratulated the companies for building healthy and inclusive societies, sustainable markets, combating corruption and safeguarding the environment. The President also announced that going forward National CSR Awards will be given away on 2 October every year. He called upon the industry to strive to achieve the target of providing good quality personal care to all orphan children. 

 

The ceremony was graced by the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, industry leaders, Shri Injeti Srinivas, and DG&CEO, IICA, Dr Sameer Sharma. A large number of senior government functionaries, CSR professionals, were present during the National CSR Awards Ceremony held here today. 

 

The National CSR Awards have been instituted by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to recognize corporate initiatives in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to achieve inclusive growth and inclusive and sustainable development. The Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA), think-tank of the Ministry, has rendered technical and logistics support in the conduct of the rigorous award process.

 

Winning companies in the third category of Awards, i.e. “Contribution of CSR in National Priority Areas” were felicitated by Finance Minister Smt Nirmala Sitharaman. In her address, the Finance Minister said that CSR is not merely contribution of funds, it is the corporate contribution towards inclusive societies which matters. Smt. Sitharaman emphasised that companies should strive for development of North Eastern region of the country. She assured the industry that while administering the law, the core spirit of CSR shall be protected. She further added that the MCA would encourage, and not force, companies to come forward and embrace CSR. She released a coffee table book on CSR activities by companies in India. The first copy of the coffee table book was presented by Smt. Sitharaman to the President of India. The book contains the noteworthy focus and impact of CSR activities on ground. 

 

Across the three award categories, companies adjudged as Honourable Mentions were felicitated by Shri Anurag Singh Thakur. In his address, he highlighted the contributions of companies through their CSR programmes in various sector such as sports, Clean Ganga, Education, health, divyang and skill & livelihood etc. He further added that CSR programmes of companies have delivered good results for divyang people in relevant sports, creation of sports infrastructure, training of sports personnel in those sports which otherwise attract lesser attention. 

 

In order to review the CSR framework and make recommendations to develop a more robust and coherent CSR regulatory and policy framework, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Shri Injeti Srinivas mentioned CSR is no longer an act of philanthropy. Rather it now flows out of business responsibility towards society and environment. He further articulated the recent key policy initiatives taken by Government.  He complimented the Jury for the rigorous three-stage selection process involving shortlisting, detailed submissions and field verification by independent experts from institutions of national repute. He further added that the government does not view CSR as a resource gap funding, instead it is expected to provide technology and innovation to address long pending challenges in the country.

 

DG & CEO, Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs, Dr Sameer Sharma delivered ‘vote of thanks’ wherein he acknowledged the contribution of various stakeholders including central and state governments, industry chambers, professional institutions, academic institutions, for their help in carrying out the award process. He expressed his gratitude to the President, Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs and Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs for gracing the occasion.

                The 1st phase of excavation by a team of Archaeological Survey of India’s Excavation Branch – VI, Bangalore at Gottiprolu near Naidupeta in Nellore (now renamed as Sri Potti Sri Ramulu) district, Andhra Pradesh has discovered the remains of a huge settlement surrounded by a massive brick enclosure. Among many other antiquities unearthed are one life size Vishnu sculpture and a wide variety of pottery of the early centuries of current era. 

The site of Gottiprolu (13° 56’ 48” N; 79° 59’ 14” E) lies on the right bank of a distributary of river Swarnamukhi about seventeen kilometers east of Naidupet and eighty kilometers from Tirupati and Nellore. Detailed topographical study and drone images have helped in identifying an early historic settlement surrounded by a fortification and the possibility of a moat encircling it. The fortification is very much clear on the eastern and southern sides of the mound while its other arm seems to have been leveled as a result of modern settlements.

The excavations carried out in the already leveled area revealed elliptical, circular and rectangular brick structures. 

The most outstanding discovery is of massive sized brick enclosure wall at the southern part of the mound. This structure is of baked bricks and exposed to a length of more than 75 meters with an average width of about 3.40 meters, which rise to a height of nearly 2 meters and runs in a curvilinear pattern towards the northern end of the mound.

Another interesting find is the small rectangular brick tank exposed near the inner lining of the curved brick structure.

The available brick sizes (43 - 48 cms) are comparable with the Satavahana / Ikshvaku period structures in Krishna valley i.e. Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda.  On the basis of the brick size and associated findings they can be placed anywhere between 2nd – 1st century BCE or little later (nearly 2000 years old). 

 

Apart from the excavated remains, one of the most major find was the discovery of a buried Vishnu sculpture from the western part of the village.

Subsequent excavations conducted around the image revealed it to be a life size image of Vishnu measuring about 2 meters in height. It displays a four-armed Vishnu standing over a pedestal carrying chakra and conch in his upper right and left hands respectively. The lower right is in bestowing boon and the left hand in katihastha (resting on the hip) posture.  The iconographical feature like the elaborate head gear, thick holy thread and decorative drapery dates it to Pallava period (circa 8th cent. CE).

 

Other interesting antiquity retrieved is the molded female terracotta figurine with two hands lifted upwards.

A series of broken terracotta pipes fitted into one another revealed about the civic amenities maintained by the occupants of this site. The drainage system pattern is understood by the exposed remains of the drainage at the site.

The findings of assorted stone tools of Palaeolithic and Neolithic 

 

periods from secondary contexts suggest that prehistoric people also occupied this area. Further studies are being carried out through geological, chemical analysis of the site/samples.

These settlements could have been an important trade centre as indicated by the presence of imitated amphorae wares that were mostly used to transport liquid commodities.

The proximity of the site to the seacoast suggests that the site could have served as a strategic settlement involved in maritime trade. Further research will reveal interesting facts about the site as trade centre. 

 



 

 

 

Other major retrieved antiquities unearthed are copper and lead coins, iron spear head, stone celts, terracotta beads, ear stud in semi precious stone and hopscotches. The ceramic assemblage of the site consisted of fine quality black and red ware collected from the lower levels, conical jars, rouletted sherds, russet coated ware etc. The extensively used goblet shaped ware indicates the typical table ware associated with the site.

Explorations conducted in and around Gottiprolu within a radius of 15 kilometers revealed important vestiges viz., fortified early historic settlement at Puduru, Sunbrahmanya temple at Mallam, unique rock cut laterite stepped well at Yakasiri, Vishnu temple at Tirumuru. Further the entire seacoast on the east is dotted with various forms of antiquarian remains extending from Tamil Nadu and culturally linked with each other. 

The two fortified townships within the gap of 15kms during early historic times indicates the significant strategic location was preferred by the early historic people for trade in the region keeping in view of proximity of the sea, River and Lake (Pulicat).

Union Minister of State for Culture & Tourism (IC), Shri Prahlad Singh Patel launched the E-Portal of CCRT ‘Digital Bharat Digital Sanskriti' and CCRT YouTube Channel today in New Delhi. The Chairperson, CCRT Dr. Hemlata S. Mohan was also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Prahlad Singh Patel appreciated the efforts of CCRT and said that this will enable dissemination of cultural education through digital interactive medium into the classrooms all over the country. For this initiative, CCRT has tied up with Routes 2 Roots, an NGO, for connecting seamlessly all the CCRT Regional Centres i.e., Guwahati, Udaipur and Hyderabad, he informed. 



Shri Prahlad Singh Patel and the Chairperson, CCRT Dr. Hemlata S. Mohan also interacted with the participants of the ongoing training programmes at CCRT Regional Centres and some of the children studying in schools across the country. Union Minister also released a film ‘Rahas’ directed by Sunil Shukla. Rahas is basically Raaslila of Chhattisgarh. Subsequently he released a book “Dewas ki Sanskritik Parampara” written by Shri Jeewan Singh Thakur.



Shri Prahlad Singh Patel specifically stressed that each and every child has a latent talent which needs to be identified. CCRT should provide a platform for specifically dropout children so that they can join the mainstream so o that they can pursue their dreams and make a career out of it be it music, painting, theatre, martial arts or any other art forms. There is a need to identify institutions specializing in providing training in various art forms and encourage the children to join these institutions.



Union Minister further said that in the coming three years we can send children studying in X – XII standard for well planned tours of North-East. In this process, he is certain that these children will become the brand ambassadors of India in future. 

He took pride in stating that our country has more number of languages than the entire countries of the world. There is a need to encourage students to learn regional languages e.g. Punjabis can learn Gujarati and vice-versa. This initiative will strengthen the bonding between citizens of India.

The Sagar component of Rashtriya Sanskriti Mahotsav (RSM) 2019 ended last evening and it was  lauded for its exceptional  presentation of programmes, for which the audiences experienced different aspects of Indian cultural performances in a graded manner . Worth mentioning are Bharatnatyam presentation by Saroja Vaidyanathan was won the hearts of all present  at the PTC Maidan, Civil Lines, Sagar. After spectacular performances in the likes of ‘Rasleela’ and ‘Chhau’ Presentations, second day had more remarkable presentations like familiar presentations of song and dance performances by artists from zonal cultural centres under the Ministry of Culture and traditional folk dances by local artists of Madhya Pradesh under the banner of ‘Mati ke Laal’ on the main stage. ‘Mati ke Laal’ has received quite applause as for the first time, cultural traditions of Madhya Pradesh are getting their due importance and exposure through Rashtriya Sanskriti Mahotsav. Conventional presentation of song and dance in traditional attire by the locals offered the local and visiting audience the chance to connect to the folk-lores, traditions and cultural heritage of the place. Beautifully choreographed presentation of Zonal cultural centre struck the audience with awe as the groups took the stage in a graceful manner.

 

 

On the occasion of ‘Karvachauth’- a ritual in Indian culture followed for centuries, second day opened with Kathak Presentation by celebrated Kathak dancer of Jabalpur ‘Nilangi Kalantre’, she presented the narrative of Krishna-leela with her group canvassed by the beautiful backdrop and light and sound organised.

The carnival of different groups presenting different dances from across states of India was the main attraction of second day at Sagar . 

 



Rastriya Sanskriti Mahotsav has been receiving continuous praise and popularity among the masses of our country for playing a major role to bridge our cultural diversity with the ancient ideal of ‘Oneness in all’ and thus it received commendable amount of love and admiration by artists and audiences alike, as it gave them an opportunity to discover rare and unexplored cultural traditions of our country, under the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Matrix.

Following classical representation of ancient dance form of Bharatnatyam by acclaimed Smt. Saroja Vaidyanathan offered the audience a spiritual journey through the her spectacular footwork. Dance offering to multiple gods and goddesses is a main component of Carnatic music, which was prevalent in Guru Vaidyanathan’s performance and made the evening spiritual, other than being merriment. Vasudev and Group from Odisha presented ‘Ghutka’ adivasi dance which was one-of-a-kind presentation as this RSM has fixed its agenda of expounding marginal and regional cultural practises so that the preservation and promotion of Indian culture manifests under the Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat matrix.

                In the series of joint bilateral exercises between India & Japan, both nations once again came together to propel their bilateral relations towards the next level. The second edition of bilateral annual military exercise Dharma Guardian - 2019 between Indian and Japanese Army culminated on 31 October 2019 at Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS) Vairengte, Mizoram in a function presided over by General Goro Yuasa, Chief of Staff, Japanense Ground Self Defence Forces and Lieutenant General Rajeev Sirohi, GOC, 3 Corps.

The primary focus of the exercise was to train and equip the contingents in counter insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in mountainous terrain. The entire curriculum was planned in a progressive manner wherein the participants initially familiarised with each others' organisation, weapons and combat skills before graduating to joint tactical exercises.

As part of the exercise, important lectures, demonstrations and drills related to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations were conducted. Both the Armies also shared their valuable experiences in countering such situations as also refined drills and procedures for joint operations. The exercise culminated with a 72 hours validation phase.

Besides fostering mutual understanding & trust, this marks reaffirmation of India & Japan to further bolster bilateral security and defence cooperation.

                The second edition of bi-annual Naval Commanders’ Conference 2019 which commenced on 22 October 2019, concluded on 24 October 2019 after three days of fruitful deliberations.

He congratulated the Navy for the swift and calibrated manner in which 'Operation Sankalp' was launched in the wake of incidents involving attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June this year, thus emphatically safeguarding Indian seafarers and the nation’s economic interests.

            The Hon’ble RM also acknowledged the expanding footprint whilst highlighting that the Indian Navy has continued to maintain a high level of operational readiness through regular deployment of ships, submarines and aircraft in our areas of interest. As the authority responsible for overall maritime security, which includes Coastal Security and Offshore Security, he also noted the concerted efforts undertaken by the Navy post 26/11 incident, including enhanced inter-agency cooperation and coordination, towards strengthening the security and stability of our waters and coastal regions. He appreciated the Navy’s efforts in the area of indigenisation, self-reliance and support to the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government.

            The Hon’ble RM stated that the Indian Navy has established itself as a vital tool for military diplomacy, furthering the national and foreign policy objectives through active cooperation and engagement with not just Indian Ocean Region nations, but maritime nations across the globe. Appreciating the Navy’s Foreign Cooperation initiatives and sustained efforts at capability enhancement and capacity building of Friendly Foreign Navies, he stated that these initiatives have not only strengthened maritime security and stability in the region, but have also resulted in transforming the Indian Navy into a ‘Preferred Partner’ for engagement in the Indian Ocean Region. 

            During his interaction with the Commanders’, the Hon’ble RM reviewed the combat readiness of the Navy, pace of modernisation and progress of various acquisition and infrastructure related cases. He urged the Naval Commanders to optimally uitlise available resources to build a strong Navy that is ready and vigilant to counter any challenge that may emerge in the maritime domain.

            In his opening address to the Commanders’, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh highlighted various important issues pertaining to operational readiness, capability enhancement, maintenance, op logistics, infrastructure development and human resource management. He also drew attention to overcoming critical capability voids, whilst highlighting the requirement of three Aircraft Carriers so that at least one operational carrier is available on either seaboard at any given time, amongst other capability gaps, especially in light of the increasing mandate of IN in the IOR.

            During deliberations, it emerged that the IN remains a well-balanced multi-dimensional force with modern surface, sub-surface and air assets, capable of blue water and littoral operations in the Indian Ocean Region and beyond to defend our national interests against potential threats. The present force levels are being augmented/ modernised for undertaking the full spectrum of roles and tasks defined for the IN. Further, IN is closely monitoring developments in our Areas of Interest, as also progressing our foreign cooperation mandated which is aimed towards outcome based interaction with other navies in the region in synch with the Hon’ble PM’s vision of SAGAR and Act East Policies. Based on the assessment of these developments, necessary steps are being initiated with the Government for strengthening the preparedness of Indian Navy.

            The Commanders’ discussed numerous issues pertaining to Functional Re-organisation of the Indian Navy and Optimal Manning in order to improve Operational Efficiency. Issues pertaining to harnessing emerging Technologies as well as use of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analysis were discussed at length and key deliverables to be achieved in the desired time frame were identified. In addition to discussing Intra-IN issues, several critical subjects relating to effective conduct of operations in a futuristic Joint Service environment were examined and an action plan arrived at.

            Chief of the Naval Staff exhorted the Commanders to maintain the highest state of operational preparedness to meet any eventuality that arises.

                As part of Indo-US Bilateral Defence Cooperation, the 9th Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) meeting was held between the delegations of India and the United States here today. The meeting was co-chaired by Secretary (Defence Production) Shri Subhash Chandra and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment of the United States Ms Ellen M Lord. These meetings are held to bring leadership focus to the bilateral defence trade relationship and create opportunities for co-production and co-development of defence equipment.

The Joint Working Groups, established under DTTI to progress mutually agreed projects for the Armed Forces, provided status update during the meeting. Engagement with the industry remains a key focus of DTTI for both the sides and measures to achieve this goal were also discussed. A significant achievement of the meeting was the signing of ‘Statement of Intent’ with respect to key deliverables in the near, medium and long terms. This will assist in bringing sustained focus on some of the projects and signal commitment of both sides towards continued collaboration on mutually beneficial issues. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Subhash Chandra said that while DTTI has been an ongoing process, both sides were now poised to actually achieve tangible outcomes. The shared values that form the bedrock of stable relations between the two sides have led to deepening of defence ties. The Government of India remains committed to continually engage with the US government and facilitate cooperation between the defence industries of both nations.

Ms Ellen Lord said that the US National Defence Strategy envisages strengthening defence alliances and partnerships. The DTTI has now matured enough where its varied activities could be translated into accomplishments. She added that the interface of the industry with DTTI would provide necessary fillip to various projects under consideration.

India has made significant strides in improving its defence exports. These have grown seven-fold over the last two years and reached to Rs 10,500 crore in 2018-19. This has been made possible due to the reforms brought in the standard operating procedure and ushering in a portal for online clearance of applications. The processing time has been brought down significantly.

Such exercises are routinely carried out by the Army to evaluate the operational efficiency of formations & units and also to assess the leadership in exercising command and control for their reactions to emerging situations.  

Earlier, similar collective training was undertaken by another formation of Eastern Command in the Along Sector. 

During the visit, Chief of the Army Staff reviewed the security situation for operational readiness and interacted with the Commanders and troops.

                Indian Air Force BrahMos unit has successfully fired two Surface to Surface missiles at Trak Island in Andaman Nicobar group of islands on
21 & 22 Oct 19. The twin firings have been carried out by the IAF as a part of training mission. The BrahMos land attack cruise missiles engaged the designated mock targets close to300 Km away and achieved direct hit in both the cases. The launch was smooth and both the missiles followed the desired trajectory. The firing by IAF demonstrates the mobility and agility of IAF units to operationally deploy and launch at targets withpin-point accuracy.

          IAF had previously successfully fired the land version of the BrahMos missile at Pokhran.

          In addition, IAF had also recently successfully fired the air version of the BrahMos missile from its frontline Su-30MKI fighter aircraft in May 19 in the same area.

          The 2.8 Mach BrahMos missile is a state-of-art supersonic cruise missile designed and developed by BAPL. The missile is ideally suited for launch from large stand-off ranges to engage fortified targets deep inside the enemy territory with precision.

          The BrahMos missile provides Indian Air Force a much desired capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target at sea or on land with pinpoint accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions. Supersonic speeds combined with capability to attack the assigned target in Single or Salvo mode ensures quicker target engagement with a high degree of assurance. The missile functions on the Fire and Forget principle with high accuracy.

                As part of Indian Navy's Overseas Deployment to South East Asia and Western Pacific, Indian Navy ships Sahyadri and Kiltan are making a port call at Manila, Philippines from 23 – 26 Oct 19. The ships are part of the Indian Navy's Eastern Fleet under the Operational Command of Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command, based at Visakhapatnam. The port call is a demonstration of India's warm ties with Philippines.   

 

IN Ships Sahyadri and Kiltan are the latest, indigenously designed and built multi-role Guided Missile Stealth Frigate and Anti-Submarine Warfare Corvette respectively. The two ships are equipped with a versatile array of weapons and sensors, can carry multi-role helicopters and represent the ‘coming of age’ of India’s warship building capabilities.

 

During the port call, there would be professional interactions between personnel of both the navies, official calls and interaction with dignitaries of the Republic of Philippines Navy. In addition, social engagements, visits by the local populace and various sports events are also planned during the visit. On completion of the visit, Indian Navy and Republic of Philippines Navy ships would be undertaking a Passage Exercise at sea, to further build on the levels of interoperability between the navies to ensure peaceful and secure seas for all.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh addressed the Naval Commanders’ Conference here today and expressed his pleasure in meeting the senior leadership of the Navy. 

Shri Rajnath Singh stated that after visiting various naval ships, submarines and establishments, including IMAC (Information Management and Analysis Centre); and having witnessed a wide range of naval operations at Sea, he is confident that the Indian Navy will continue to perform the duty of safeguarding the maritime interests of the nation. 

Raksha Mantri said, for Indian economy to reach the Five Trillion Dollar mark by 2025 there is a requirement for a stable and balanced environment in which Navy has a crucial role to play in the form of safeguarding the Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC) – the economic lifeline. He noted that it was heartening to see the swift and calibrated manner in which the Navy launched 'Operation Sankalp', in wake of the incidents involving attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June this year. Escorting Indian Flagged Merchant Vessels through this energy lifeline of the country during ‘Operation Sankalp’, the Navy has emphatically reiterated its ability to defend India’s critical national interests. 

Speaking on Global terrorism, Raksha Mantri stated that it continues to be a challenge for all security forces and that sea routes have their own vulnerability. Post 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, Navy has made concerted efforts to strengthen security and stability of our waters and coastal regions, and enhance inter-agency cooperation and coordination. He urged the Naval Commanders to continue reviewing procedures and strengthen the Coastal Security framework, so as to counter emerging threats and challenges, effectively. 

Commending its role, Raksha Mantri said, the Navy’s Anti-Piracy Patrol duties in the Gulf of Aden since 2008, have been successful in safeguarding our maritime interests, and contributed immensely to maintaining maritime security of the region, which is in consonance with the Hon'ble Prime Minister’s Vision. 

Shri Rajnath Singh also complimented the Navy for the efficient Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Operations undertaken in the recent past, both on Indian and foreign shores convincing him on the reach, mobility, sustenance and persistence of the Indian Navy, and its ability to undertake operations not only within the country, but in the entire Indian Ocean Region, in peace and during war. 

Raksha Mantri said that the Indian Navy has also established itself as a vital tool for military diplomacy, furthering the national and foreign policy objectives through active cooperation and engagement with not just Indian Ocean Region nations, but maritime nations across the globe. Appreciating the Navy’s Foreign Cooperation initiatives and sustained efforts at capability enhancement and capacity building of Foreign Navies, he stated that these initiatives have not only strengthened maritime security and stability in the region, but have also resulted in transforming the Indian Navy into a Preferred Partner for engagement in the Indian Ocean Region. 

Shri Rajnath Singh appreciated the role of Navy in the field of indigenisation in consonance with the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government. Dedicated thrust has also been accorded to marine infrastructure projects in line with the ongoing and future expansion plans of the Navy. This includes strategic infrastructure projects like the Aircraft Carrier Dry Dock at Mumbai which Raksha Mantri inaugurated last month. He urged the senior leadership to maintain their focus on futuristic capability development, to ensure that the nation’s maritime power grows in tandem with our economic interests. 

Raksha Mantri added that he had commissioned INS Khanderi and witnessed the launch of Nilgiri last month. These platforms bear testimony to the self-reliance in warship building that the nation has achieved. He emphasised on the need to increase the indigenous content with respect to complex machinery, and cutting-edge weapons and sensors urging all stakeholders to put in all-out efforts on these fronts. 

Speaking on the announcement by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on the CDS (Chief of Defence Staff), the Raksha Mantri stated that this would also improve the overall coordination amongst the three services. 

Raksha Mantri reiterated that a strong Navy remains a necessary guarantor of India’s security and prosperity, and therefore the need for a modern, potent and credible Navy cannot be over-emphasised. He stated that he was confident that the Naval Commanders would identify key focus areas and strategies to further enhance the capability and efficiency of the Navy and wished fruitful deliberations. 

Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Karambir Singh; Defence Secretary Dr Ajay Kumar; Secretary Department of Defence R&D and Chairman DRDO Dr G Satheesh Reddy, Naval Commanders and other senior officials of Ministry of Defence were present on the occasion.

	The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh, met today and accorded approval for Capital Procurement for the Defence forces amounting over Rs. 3300 crores of indigenously designed and developed equipment.
	Maintaining its impetus on the ‘Make in India’ initiative, the DAC accorded approval for three projects to be indigenously designed, developed and manufactured by the Indian industry. The first two projects include third generation Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGM) and the Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) for the T-72 and T-90 Tanks. While the third generation ATGM would provide ‘Fire and Forget’ and “Top Attack” capabilities to the troops in an armoured battle, the APUs would enable incorporation of various upgrades to Fire Control System and Night Fighting capabilities of the Tanks. Both these projects will be progressed under the ‘Make-II’ Category and will provide a boost to indigenous research and development in the Private Sector. With this, for the first time the Ministry of Defence has offered complex Military equipment to be designed, developed and manufactured by the Indian private industry.
	The third indigenous project pertains to discrete Electronic Warfare (EW) systems for the mountain and High Altitude terrain, which would be designed and developed by DRDO and manufactured by design cum production partner from the Indian industry.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has reiterated the Government’s unwavering commitment to bolster border infrastructure to effectively deal with any threats that undermine the peace and tranquillity in the country. He was inaugurating strategically important ‘Col Chewang Rinchen Setu’, a bridge built by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) over River Shyok, connecting Durbuk and Daulat Beg Oldie in Eastern Ladakh, today.



“Keeping in view the current security situation, strengthening our borders is the need of the hour. Border area development is an integral part of our Government’s plan and this bridge is a part of that strategy”, Raksha Mantri said.

Shri Rajnath Singh said, “India shares cordial relations with China. There are perceptional differences between both the countries on the boundary issue but the issue has been handled with great maturity and responsibly. Both the countries have not allowed the situation to escalate or go out of hand.”



Raksha Mantri added, “Kashmir is India’s internal and integral matter. Even the Chinese President Mr Xi Jinping did not mention Kashmir in his meeting with Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in Mahabalipuram. China’s recent statement for action against terror is also significant.”

Raksha Mantri said, with the decision to make Ladakh a separate Union Territory, the Government has fulfilled the long-pending demand of the people, which will open new doors of development in the region. “Like the rest of the country, Ladakh will now become a destination for investment. There will also be a boost in revenue generation and employment opportunities for local people”, he added.

Raksha Mantri said, abrogation of Article 370 will put an end to terrorism and separatism which, since independence, has led to the killing of thousands of innocent people. He said, the decision will strengthen human rights and help in empowering women of the area.

Shri Rajnath Singh described ‘Col Chewang Rinchen Setu’ as a symbol of the Government’s resolve of positive change and all-round development of the nation. He said, the bridge not only connects Durbuk with Daulat Beg Oldie but also links the people of Ladakh and all interior areas of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country. “Through initiatives like these, the people of this region will have the opportunity to become part of India’s growth story”, Shri Rajnath Singh hoped.

Hailing BRO as an ‘inspirational and disciplined force’, Shri Rajnath Singh lauded it for playing a leading role in the infrastructure development in far-flung areas in extremely tough and inhospitable terrain. He also appreciated BRO for playing a pivotal role in helping the people living in these areas.

Raksha Mantri termed connectivity as one of the most important aspects of development adding that new avenues can be opened through people-to-people contact. Saying that BRO is utilising over Rs 900 crore for the development of Ladakh, Raksha Mantri expressed confidence that the region will soon become a hub for not only domestic but foreign tourists as well. He complimented BRO for constructing 1,200 kms of roads in financial year 2018-19.

Raksha Mantri paid rich tribute to Col Chewang Rinchen, saying that his courage and valour is a source of inspiration to one and all. He also felicitated Dr Phunsog Angmo, daughter of Col Rinchen, for the contribution made by her father in the service of the nation.

Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Rawat, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, DG BRO Lt Gen Harpal Singh, Ladakh Member of Parliament Shri Jamyang Tsering Namgyal and other senior officers of Army, BRO and Ministry of Defence were present on the occasion.

Sandwiched between strategic Karakoram and Chang Chenmo ranges, the ‘Col Chewang Rinchen Setu’ is a 430-metre bridge built at an altitude of about 15,000 feet using Micro Piling Technology. The construction has been completed in record time within 15 months.

Col Chewang Rinchen, born on November 11, 1931 at Sumur, Nubra Valley in Ladakh region, is known as the “Lion of Ladakh” for his extraordinary acts of courage in defending Leh and Partapur sector. He is one of only six Armed Forces personnel to have been twice awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, the second highest Indian Gallantry Award.

                The second edition of Naval Commanders' Conference of 2019 is scheduled at New Delhi from 22 to 24 Oct 19. The conference is the apex level biannual event for interaction between the Naval Commanders for deliberation and formulation of important policy decisions. During the course of three days, the Chief of the Naval Staff, with the Commanders-in-Chief, will review major operational, materiel, logistics, HR, training and administrative activities undertaken during the previous six months and deliberate upon the course to be steered in the ensuing months. 

          The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri will address the Naval Commanders on the opening day and interact with them. The conference also provides an opportunity for institutionalised interaction of Naval Commanders with senior Government officials to take ahead a number of inter-Ministerial initiatives towards development of a safe and secure maritime environment essential for holistic economic growth of the country.

          The deliberations during the Conference will focus on addressing the contemporary security paradigms whilst seeking ways to enhance the combat potential of the Navy and to make the operations more efficient. Accordingly, the theme of discussions will focus on the 'Functional Reorganisation of Indian Navy towards improving Operational Efficiency' and 'Optimal Manning' wherein contemporary issues pertaining to 'operations', maintenance', 'op-logistics', 'data management' and 'improvement of organisational practices' are listed for deliberations. The event also provides an opportunity for the Commanders to undertake detailed review of the performance of weapon/ sensors, readiness of IN platforms. 

          All future operations would be planned and executed jointly by the three Services and therefore the ways to optimise joint planning structures, Tri-Service Synergy and operational readiness will be deliberated during the interaction with NSA, Chiefs of Indian Army and IAF. Commanders will also review the ongoing naval projects with a focus to enhance indigenisation through 'Make in India'.

          The half yearly conference also reviews the developments in the region with a view to assess the way ahead for implementation of initiatives towards the concept of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) articulated by the Hon'ble PM.

                In the series of joint bilateral exercises between India & Mongolia, both nations have once again come together to enhance bilateral friendship to the next level. The fourteenth edition of joint military training exercise between Indian Army and Mongolian Army named EX NOMADIC ELEPHANT 2019 which commenced on 05 Oct 19 concluded at Foreign Training Node (FTN), Bakloh on 18 Oct 19.  

          The primary focus of the exercise was to train and equip the contingents to undertake joint counter insurgency and counter terrorist operations in mountainous terrain under United Nations mandate.  The entire curriculum was planned in a progressive manner wherein the participants initially familiarized with each other’s organizational structure, weapons and combat skills before graduating to joint tactical exercises.  The contingents honed their tactical and technical skills in a wide spectrum of counter insurgency operations including joint training on weapons and equipment, cross training exercises and field training exercises.  Both sides jointly planned and executed a series of well-developed tactical operations based on scenarios that are likely to be encountered in mountainous terrain. 

          The exercise provided an ideal platform for both contingents to share their operational experience and expertise while also being instrumental in broadening the interoperability and cooperation between the armies of India and Mongolia.  

          The joint exercise will surely foster the spirit of friendship and enhance the strategic military relationship between India and Mongolia to higher levels.

                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has signed 30 licensing agreements for Transfer of Technology (ToT) with 16 Indian companies, including three start-ups, at Vibrant Goa Global Expo and Summit 2019, which is being held at Goa University, Taleigao, Goa between October 17-19, 2019. 

The DRDO develops technologies for the Armed Forces and has been carrying out ToT of these technologies to the defence industry for end use of the Armed Forces.

Indian Armed Forces are procuring ready-to-eat meals, survival ration and emergency flying ration products from companies which have acquired ToT from DRDO. These products cater to the requirements of the Armed Forces deployed in inhospitable terrain and hostile weather conditions. These products have high nutrition value and higher shelf-life. These technologies are useful for the larger interest of society.

Vibrant Goa Summit provided an opportunity for the companies to interact with DRDO scientists who have developed these technologies. The event was inaugurated by the Chief Minister of Goa Shri Pramod Sawant yesterday and was attended by senior officials from the Government of Goa and DRDO.

                1.    The sixth edition of the annual Dilli seminar on ‘Role of Seapower in Shaping of Nations’ commenced this morning at the Indian Naval Academy (INA). Several serving and retired senior Naval Officers, eminent academicians, representatives of think tanks, defence analysts and distinguished luminaries are attending the two day seminar.       

2.    The seminar proceedings commenced with the opening address by Vice Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, AVSM, NM,  Commandant, INA. This was followed by the keynote address  delivered by the chief guest Admiral Madhavendra Singh, AVSM, NM (Retd), former Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy.

3.      The first session of day one - ‘Sea Power Vs Land Power – A Historical Perspective’ - chaired by Dr. Dattesh Parulekar,  commenced with a presentation by Commander B Srinivas on the topic ‘Security Ashore : Supremacy at Sea’. The officer is a Navigation and Direction specialist and holds a Diploma in International Maritime Law from Gujarat National Law University. The session touched upon the differences between sea power and land power, their interdependence, and some lessons for the times to come.

4.         The second paper – ‘Sea Power vs Land Power : The Indian (and Indian Navy) Perspective’ - presented by Commodore Srikant B Kesnur brought out how Indian thinkers have highlighted India’s pre-occupation with land borders and how often we have been accused of sea-blindness. The presentation also dwelt upon the Navy at Independence and growth of Navy thereafter in terms of acquisitions as well as conceptual and doctrinal growth.

5.      Session one of the day culminated with an invitational talk by Vice Admiral Girish Luthra, PVSM, AVSM, VSM (Retd.) former Flag Officer Commanding in Chief, Western Naval Command.

                 “I am delighted to be with all of you today, particularly in the session on Emerging Technologies and presentations by young scientists.  It is indeed a new initiative encouraged by our Prime Minister. He suggested that young scientists below the age of 35 years be given an opportunity to innovate and explore frontier areas.  With this in view, DRDO has taken the momentous step of setting up five Young Scientists’ Laboratories working in five niche technology areas such as Artificial intelligence, Quantum Technologies, Cognitive Technologies, Asymmetric Technologies and Smart Materials. Having seen the five presentations today, I am confident that DRDO’s initiative has been worthwhile.

Today we see technology evolution across various landscapes at an unprecedented intensity and scale. This means that we need to develop a strong understanding as well as insights on these technological changes and anticipate focus areas in order to first gain, and then maintain, a competitive edge. This is critical not just for geopolitical and national security reasons, but also to ensure that we sit at the high table in global dialogues and initiatives in the field of innovation as well as trade and commerce.

I suggest three R’s: Requirement, Resources and Relevance as key factors in determining our country’s quest for advancement in emerging technologies.

Our requirement is to seek advancement in key technologies of future to safeguard our national interest in a constantly evolving geo-political arena and ensure socio-economic progress through application of such technologies.  Our pursuit of technological advancement is not for exerting influence or dominating others but to make it a level-playing field.

Availability of key resources could be a limiting factor in this quest. This could, on the other hand, offer an opportunity to innovate. Using such initiatives in emerging technologies, DRDO must hone its skills so as to become a net producer of value-added resources.

The third R is relevance. These emerging technologies must be relevant to development efforts.  Spin-offs from these emerging technologies would support our progress in various spheres. For example, space related technologies developed by ISRO help farmers in many ways. Similarly, innovative use of artificial intelligence in agriculture, manufacturing industry, and even use of smart materials could be of immense relevance to various sectors of the economy.

Today’s technology edge is driven by two key performance parameters: technology assessment and technology forecasting. Future of technology landscape will be determined by what drives the future and who drives it. Early bird not only gets choicest pickings but also long-term dividend. The capability of early forecasting of technological innovations and investing accordingly into ‘intellectual capital’ is essential in this respect.  The best investment would be in young graduates from our country’s premier institutions, who have the potential to match with the pace of a fast-changing world. Young scientists will be capable of making desired advances in next generation technology and innovation, provided they are supported by an ecosystem which allows them freedom to think and execute.

The young scientist labs should not operate in silos.  They should keep abreast with associated researchers in related fields and the requirements of the industry.  This logic extends to the cross-platform integration of focus areas in these five labs, because the focus areas are interdependent in their technological premise as well as applications.  Hence, they need to talk to each other.

Fast-paced developments in technology sector offers several opportunities, but also many challenges. Many projects in these laboratories might face long gestation periods. One should note that the evolution cycle does not make a project obsolete.  

A mechanism also needs to be evolved to monitor the progress against the stated objectives, and constantly update with international developments in related fields. We do not wish to end up in a scenario where we are found to be reinventing the wheel.

At the same time, I do appreciate that sometimes, the value of an idea is evident only with the passage of time.  Therefore, if it appears prima facie to be of relevance in our national context it should be pursued, and not given up just because its immediate utility appears to be limited.

Another aspect is that outcomes of our research and technology development should be such that it is possible to scale it up in the industrial context and real-life situations.  Increased scale will lead to its usefulness and also competitiveness in terms of price and affordability.

I must also take this opportunity to touch upon an important issue here.  When we talk about enabling ecosystem we should not limit ourselves to providing it in just the labs so that our young scientists can work freely and without any encumbrance.  We should ask the question, whether we have addressed the issue of how these labs source chips to further their research?  From where will they get critical equipment to support their quest?  How will they find raw materials to experiment? Trade of many, or perhaps all of these items, might be under international safeguard mechanisms and protocols. We have to give adequate thought to it. In fact, these labs must be linked to indigenous development of ‘supporting hardware’ in chips, materials and so on. This will truly be in line with our Prime Minister’s another flagship initiative in Make in India.

We should not just be content with developing new technologies and their applications. We must aspire to become global leaders and important stakeholders in new international protocols, which are bound to be formulated and reformulated as the world sees a constant transformation in technological and innovation landscape. I look forward to seeing our share in patent applications from these focus areas rise manifolds in the years to come.

These five labs will offer a useful template of R&D in the field of emerging technologies in our country. Their success is essential for our country gaining pole position in this global race, where shelf-life of products as well as technologies is getting increasingly shorter. This is a bus we cannot afford to miss, if we want to achieve a decent quality of life for our citizens and a say which is commensurate with our requirements and ambitions in international platforms.

I once again compliment the efforts made by the young scientists. The quality of their presentations indicate that they have the incentive, capability and potentials to take DRDO’s research and development activities to new heights.”

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 41st DRDO Directors’ Conference at DRDO Bhawan here today. The Conference is an annual event, where a number of brainstorming sessions are planned over two days.

In his address, Shri Rajnath Singh said DRDO has made Defence forces of the country strong and congratulated Secretary Department of Defence R&D & Chairman DRDO Dr G Satheesh Reddy and all DRDO Scientists and personnel. He appreciated the DRDO for achieving the 100 days’ target and identifying milestones to commemorate 75 years of Independence and the roadmap for 5 years.

Raksha Mantri asked DRDO fraternity to imbibe the working ethos of former President Bharat Ratna Dr A P J Abdul Kalam. He stated that defence R&D and manufacturing has the potential to provide highest employment, direct or indirect. He asked DRDO to aim for the systems with technologies that should remain contemporary for next 10-15 years so that the Armed Forces maintain technological superiority. 

Shri Rajnath Singh further stated that technology also has its limitations and development of products have a gestation period. For such complex systems, the technical requirements keep evolving during the development cycle. Spiral development of these systems should be preferred option. 

The inaugural function of the conference was also attended among others by National Security Advisor Shri Ajit Doval, Chief of the Army Staff General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh and  Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria.    

Shri Ajit Doval appreciated DRDO for doing commendable work despite all challenges. He stated that DRDO has a seminal role in making India technologically strong. He mentioned that in modern war, technology and finance are going to decide the outcome of the war in which technology is more important. He further said that need based technology will enable us to have an edge over our adversaries. Critical technologies should be developed indigenously. The DRDO is the only organisation which can take up system integration and should further strengthen it.

General Bipin Rawat in his address stated that DRDO has made major strides to ensure that needs of the services are met by providing various systems like Artillery Gun System, Mines, Anti-tank missile systems, etc. He was confident that future wars will be won with indigenous systems.

Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh in his address stated that Indian Navy is efficiently using Varunastra, Maareech, Ushus, TAL and various other DRDO developed systems. Shri Rajnath Singh added that warfare and technologies are synonymous and go rapid changes. These must be factored during design stage.

Speaking on the occasion, Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria said that technology leadership is what defines DRDO. He also mentioned that DRDO has been able to achieve the objectives of self-reliance to a great extent in the past seven decades. He appreciated DRDO’s role in Electronic Warfare Technologies, Radars, Composite materials for LCA, AEW&C, Astra and various other technologies.

He also appreciated the capabilities of LCA Tejas and asked DRDO to develop next generation aircraft AMCA, harnessing the technologies and experience of LCA.  

Dr G Satheesh Reddy, Secretary Department of Defence R&D & Chairman DRDO spoke about successful development of ASAT, BrahMos, ASTRA, Nag missile, SAAW, Arjun MBT Mk 1A, 46 metre Modular Bridge, MPR, LLTR Ashwini, etc. He added that the theme for 41st DRDO Directors’ Conference is Technology leadership for empowering India, in line with the requirement to develop indigenous systems with advanced technologies.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has called upon defence scientists to strive for developing cutting-edge technologies indigenously to make India not only self-reliant in defence manufacturing but also global leader in the field. 

Raksha Mantri was speaking at the inaugural session of the 41st Directors’ Conference of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), with the theme ‘Technology Leadership for Empowering India’, on the occasion of 88th birth anniversary of former President Bharat Ratna Dr A P J Abdul Kalam, here today. 

Emphasising that research and maintaining operational superiority is the need of the hour, Shri Rajnath Singh said, the world is changing and advanced & disruptive technologies are emerging at a rapid pace. He called for developing ‘indigenous innovation ecosystem’ with less dependence on imported systems to achieve self-reliance in critical technologies. “Development of technology should be cost effective and time efficient,” he added.

Stressing the need to bridge the technology gap for India to become a global leader in research and development, Raksha Mantri urged the scientists to focus on technologies that provide cutting edge capability and remain relevant for the next 15-20 years. “There are certain limitations in technology and there is a gestation period for development of products. It is possible that during the gestation period of complex systems, new technical requirements emerge. Spiral development should be given priority for such systems,” he further said.

Suggesting an intense interaction between DRDO and all stakeholders, Shri Rajnath Singh urged scientists to devise an action plan for excellence in Defence R&D that can take India to renewed heights in defence capability. He said, with concerted efforts, India can become a ‘technology exporter’, which will have multi-dimensional benefits. 

Raksha Mantri termed scientific knowledge, innovation, advanced technology, industrial infrastructure and workforce as ‘currency’ of modern times, adding that basic R&D in science and technology identifies new knowledge that can prove to be useful in both civil and military sectors. “Innovation brings investment and at the same time provides better value to investors. It contributes in establishing a win-win situation,” he said.

Shri Rajnath Singh added that through initiatives such as ‘Make in India’, investment facilitation, skills enhancement, intellectual property protection and manufacturing infrastructure, the Government is leaving no stone unturned to make India a global manufacturing hub in near future. 

Describing DRDO as the main centre for indigenous R&D, Raksha Mantri said, DRDO is committed to progressive enhancement of self sufficiency in strategic defence systems & infrastructure. He expressed confidence that the world-class weapon platforms and systems like combat vehicles, missiles, multi-barrel rocket launcher, unmanned aerial vehicle, radar, electronic warfare systems, combat aircraft, propellants & explosives, will help in making India self-reliant in defence sector. 

Raksha Mantri congratulated DRDO for achieving all targets earmarked for 100 days and lauded the organisation for setting a target to become fully self-reliant in the next five years. He commended DRDO for its vast contribution in providing direct and indirect employment and helping the people as well as Armed Forces personnel in far flung areas such as Ladakh.

Remembering Dr Kalam, the ‘Missile Man of India’, Shri Rajnath Singh said, the former President’s contribution in the Space Research & Missile Development Program helped India find a place in top countries known for their indigenous capabilities. He described DRDO, which started on a mission mode, as the symbol of capability and courage, similar to the life of Dr Kalam. Raksha Mantri said, DRDO has made the country strong and secure by providing cutting edge technologies and internationally competitive systems to the Armed Forces.

                   The second edition of Indian Navy(IN) –Bangladesh Navy(BN) Coordinated Patrol (CORPAT) commenced in Northern Bay of Bengal on 10 Oct 19. INS Ranvijay, a guided-missile destroyer and INS Kuthar, an indigenously built missile Corvette are participating in the CORPAT along with BNS Ali Haider, a Type 053 frigate and BNS Shadinota, a Type 056 stealth guided missile corvette. The two-day CORPAT will be followed by the maiden edition of IN-BN Bilateral Exercise at Visakhapatnam from 12 to 16 Oct 19.    
 
          The IN-BN CORPAT which commenced in 2018, is aimed at upgrading to a bilateral exercise with the navies engaging in seamanship evolutions, flying exercises with integral helicopters and maritime patrol aircraft at sea. Additionally, exercises entailing the development of mutual communication and sharing of best practices would also be undertaken, adding a new dimension to the Indo - Bangladesh maritime relations. With a common territorial boundary of over 4000 km and a maritime boundary, navies of both the counties aim to practice and hone their mutual cooperation whilst patrolling near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) during the current edition of CORPAT.
 
          The sea phase would be followed by harbour phase that would include professional interaction between the navies, visits to the Indian Naval training and maintenance facilities at Visakhapatnam. The exercise would also include air familiarisation of BN aircrew towards a better understanding of MPA operations at INS Dega and a ten-day training exercise between IN Marine Commandos and BN SWADS.

Immediately after its raising in 1986, the Army Aviation Corps proved its impeccable combat credentials during 'Operation Pawan' in Sri Lanka. The Siachen Glacier has been the ultimate operational frontier for the Corps since 1984. Routinely operating at 20000 feet and above in extremely challenging conditions, the highly skilled and motivated pilots of the Corps have been supporting 'Operation Meghdoot' with skill and dedication.

          The President congratulated Lieutenant General Kanwal Kumar, Director General and Colonel Commandant of Army Aviation and all ranks (both serving and retired) for their devotion to duty and professional conduct.

The ceremony was witnessed by Shri Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Governor of Maharashtraand various civil and military dignitaries. General Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General PS Rajeshwar, Chief of Integrated Defence Staff and Lieutenant General SK Saini, GOC-in-C Southern Command alongwith a large number of serving officers and veterans witnessed the grand ceremony and helicopter fly past.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh said India and France intend to explore ways to strengthen their defence industrial partnership. Addressing the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of French Defence Industries in Paris today, Shri Rajnath Singh called upon the French companies for collaboration to modernise India’s shipyards and defence platforms by infusion of technology and asked them to make India its base for production of defence equipment not only for India’s large market but also for export to other countries. 

“We have undertaken significant economic reforms to improve the ease of doing business and opening up the economy for investments. Our Government under the leadership of our Prime Minister Modi has opened up defence sector manufacturing to a large extent under the ‘Make in India’ initiative”, he said. 

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh underlined the significance of implementation of a single Goods and Services Tax across India, the biggest tax reform since its independence. “We have recently reduced our corporate tax significantly. For ‘Make in India’ in Defence if there is need for further tax rationalisation, it may be considered suitably”, Shri Singh said. 

Raksha Mantri applauded the French companies for regularly participating in DefExpos organised in India with great energy and enthusiasm. He extended a special invitation to French firms to participate in DefExpo, which will be held in Lucknow from February 05 to 08, 2020. “Lucknow happens to be a city of rich culture and heritage and the French people are known to be highly appreciative of great cultures. Lucknow is the capital of Uttar Pradesh which is also a land of new opportunities”, he added. 

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh highlighted India’s substantial requirement of Aero engines both in civil and military domains. He requested French OEMs to consider exploring development of an Aero engine complex on government -to- government basis saying French companies could leverage from advantages in India such as low wages and availability of technical manpower. 

India’s Ambassador to France Shri Vinay Kwatra gave the welcome address. Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence Shri Barun Mitra also gave a presentation on DefExpo 2020. Dr Ajay Kumar, Defence Secretary also addressed the CEOs.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh today emphasised on the focus to equip Indian Air Force and enhance its capabilities, saying that the new Rafale Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) will make India stronger and will give a boost to its air dominance exponentially to ensure peace and security in the region. In his address at the Rafale handing over Ceremony in Merignac, France, he said it was a historic and landmark day for the Indian Armed Forces. 

“In India, today is Dussehra, the festival where we celebrate victory over evil. It is also the 87th Indian Air Force Day. Therefore, today’s day becomes symbolic in so many ways”, Shri Rajnath Singh said.

Raksha Mantri Rajnath Singh says the strong cooperation between India and France will continue to grow and contribute to global peace, prosperity and environmental sustainability. He also stressed the importance of the ceremony saying it signifies the depth of strategic partnership between India and France.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh also said he was glad in knowing that a large number of India Air Force officers and airmen are being trained in France for flying, maintenance support and logistics for handling Rafale fighter aircraft and hoped the training in French facilities will help the crew in acquiring knowledge and professional expertise required for performing their task in India.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh pointed out that the Rafale Project Monitoring Team (PMT) from India has been positioned in France since August 2017 to ensure smooth implementation of the project. Shri Rajnath Singh said he was happy that the delivery of Rafale aircraft is on schedule and will add to the strength of Indian Air force.

 “I look forward to flying in the Rafale aircraft. This will be a great honour and experience”, he added. 

Raksha Mantri performed the ‘Shastra Puja’ on Rafale on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami.

Also, present on the occasion was French Minister of Armed Forces, Ms Florence Parly and Chief Executive Officer of Dassault Aviation, Mr Eric Trappier.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh held talks with President of the French Republic, Mr Emmanuel Macron, in Paris on October 8, 2019. Raksha Mantri had arrived in Paris on Monday for a two-day official visit to France. During the talks, the two leaders comprehensively discussed key aspects of bilateral defence partnership and resolved to continue strengthening the ties between the two countries. “I thanked President Macron for his strong support to further intensifying our strategic partnership, especially in the defence sector, with India and for our ‘Make in India’ initiatives”, Shri Rajnath Singh said after the meeting. Raksha Mantri also thanked the French President for the strong support by France to India's strategic interests and principles, including in fighting terrorism.

Earlier, Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh on his arrival in Paris had tweeted that France is India’s important strategic partner and its special relationship with India goes far beyond the realm of formal ties. Raksha Mantri also said that his visit to France is aimed at expanding the existing strategic partnership between both the countries.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh also expressed his deepest condolences, on behalf of the Indian Government and its people, upon the demise of former French President Mr Jacques Chirac, saying Mr Chirac had played a decisive role in forging India-France Strategic Partnership.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh will later participate in the Rafale fighter aircraft handing over ceremony at Merignac in Bordeaux along with French Minister of Armed Forces Ms Florence Parly. Raksha Mantri is also scheduled to perform the ‘Shastra Puja’ on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami before flying a sortie in the Rafale fighter aircraft.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has given in principle approval to enhancement of monetary assistance to Next of Kin (NoK) of all categories of Battle Casualty (BC) from Rs two lakh to Rs eight lakh. The amount will be granted under Army Battle Casualties Welfare Fund (ABCWF).

Earlier, there was a provision of financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to the Battle casualties which are fatal, 60 per cent & above disability, battle casualties invalided out due to disability and Rs 1 lakh to disability less than 60 per cent. It was in addition to liberalised family pension, financial assistance from Army Group Insurance, Army Welfare Fund and ex-gratia amount.

The ABCWF has been set up under Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare (ESW), Ministry of Defence after a large number of people offered to provide monetary assistance to the families of battle casualties following an incident in February 2016 at Siachen, wherein 10 soldiers were buried in an avalanche. The ABCWF was instituted in July 2017 and was implemented retrospectively with effect from April 2016.

The fund was created under the Charitable Endowments Act, 1890. A Bank Account bearing No. 90552010165915 was opened in the South Block Branch of Syndicate Bank, New Delhi for public to deposit money.

This fund is in addition to the various existing schemes for the welfare of NoK and children of battle casualties in form of additional ex gratia.

In addition to the above assistance, the already existing monetary grant includes ex-gratia (central) for various ranks ranging from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 45 lakh and Army Group Insurance ranging from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 75 lakh.

Rs 60,000 under Death Link Insurance Scheme, DLICS (JCO/ORs); Rs 15,000 under Army Wives Welfare Association (AWWA); full reimbursement of tuition fees for wards; up to 70% concession on railway tickets and marriage grant for daughters, widow remarriage and orphan son’s marriage of battle casualties (fatal) and physical casualties (fatal) are also among the immediate & long-term assistance provided by the Ministry.

Earlier, when he was Minister of Home Affairs, Shri Rajnath Singh had launched ‘Bharat ke Veer fund’ to assist families of paramilitary personnel killed or injured in action. The fund became hugely popular within a short span of time and received widespread support from all quarters.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has called for an increased and active participation of the private sector in defence manufacturing to achieve the Government’s target of making the Indian defence industry worth $26 billion by 2025. He was addressing the captains of industry at the 22nd India International Security Expo, 2019 (Defence & Homeland Security) here today. Shri Rajnath Singh reaffirmed the Government’s aim of inclusive growth and making India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, adding that the defence sector will play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. “Our aim is to make a world class domestic defence industry that is self-reliant and less dependent on imports”, he added.

Raksha Mantri stressed that in its present set up of ‘Minimum Government and Maximum Governance’, the Government plays the role of a facilitator and the duty of the industry is to work in tandem to realise the vision of ‘New & Strong India’. He hoped that the industry partners will come up with concrete investment and technological intervention proposals related to defence and avail the business opportunities present in the sector. He said, there is a need to make the system investor friendly and create a conducive atmosphere for the growth of defence production with an increased participation of the private sector.

Shri Rajnath Singh assured the defence industry that the Government is open to new ideas and remains committed to harness the entrepreneurship spirit and energies of the private sector. “As a friend, philosopher & guide, the Government is ready to hold frank discussions, even on issues and problems”, he said. Raksha Mantri expressed confidence that the Indian Defence Industry will touch newer heights and make India a major defence manufacturing hub. He invited domestic as well as foreign defence manufacturers to participate in DefExpo 2020 to held in Lucknow from 05 – 08 February.

Sharing his vision of making India an economic powerhouse and global superpower, Raksha Mantri said, he wants that every citizen of the country feels safe & secure and works for the progress of the nation to the best of his/her ability.

Describing the recent decision to reduce the Corporate Tax rate as historic, Raksha Mantri said, the step reflects the Government’s commitment to boost growth and investment.

Shri Rajnath Singh also listed out the recent measures taken by the Ministry of Defence under ‘Make in India’ programme, including for Start-Ups & MSMEs, to further enhance the participation of Indian industry. He said, Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016 has been revised to promote domestic defence industry. Raksha Mantri also highlighted that the majority of capital procurement approvals given by the Defence Acquisition Council are indigenously developed or produced. “Buy India – Indigenously Designed, Developed & Manufactured (IDDM) has been introduced to promote indigenously designed & developed defence equipments”, he added.

On the Defence Industry Corridors in Uttar Pradesh & Tamil Nadu, Shri Rajnath Singh said, the corridors are being established to provide state-of-the-art infrastructure for the setting up of defence production facilities.

                Tenth edition of the Joint Military Exercise Ekuverin between the Indian Army and the Maldives National Defence Force will be organised from 07 to 20 October 2019 at Aundh Military Station in Pune, Maharashtra. The Indian Army and the Maldives National Defence Forces have been conducting Exercise Ekuverin meaning ‘Friends’ in the Dhivehi language since 2009. The 14 days Joint Exercise held alternatively in India and Maldives focuses on enhancing interoperability between the two forces for carrying out counter insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in a semi-urban environment under the United Nations mandate. 

          The focus of the exercise will be on sharing of best practices and acquainting each other with the operating procedures being followed while undertaking counter insurgency and counter-terrorism operations. The last exercise was held in 2018 at Northern Area Headquarters, Lh. Maafilaafushi of Maldives. India shares very close ethnic, linguistic, cultural, religious and commercial ties with the Maldives and Exercise Ekuverin will assist in further strengthening of these ties between the two nations.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh today unveiled a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi Cantonment and paid rich tribute to the Father of the Nation as a rare person who wielded so much influence over people without occupying formal positions of power. 

The statue of Mahatma Gandhi was erected by the Directorate of Defence Estates on his 150th birth anniversary celebrations at Sri Nagesh Garden in Delhi Cantt. Raksha Mantri also paid tributes to Former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri who shares birthday with Mahatma Gandhi.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Rajnath Singh said Mahatma Gandhi’s political programmes had economic, social and cultural messages as well for the people at large. Referring to the Champaran Movement, Shri Rajnath Singh said that Mahatma Gandhi, while fighting for the rights of exploited indigo farmers, urged them to work also for the cleanliness of their surroundings and villages. For him that was as important as freedom.  

He said that the cleanliness ideas and works of Mahatma Gandhi were made into a people’s movement by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The result is there for everyone to see. Coverage of toilets in households has increased from 37 per cent in 2014 to 98 per cent now. In all, total of 11 crore toilets have been made in the last five years. 

Raksha Mantri urged people to extend cleanliness programme to cover environment protection and to vow not to use single use plastic bags as these are extremely harmful to the Mother Nature. Instead, he advocated usage of cloth bags which are environment friendly. Shri Rajnath Singh said it will also generate employment for the poor. He termed saving rivers from pollution is like saving our civilisation.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh administered Swacchta oath to people present at the venue. He later planted a sapling while taking part in ‘Swachhta Hi Sewa’ campaign.  

Member of Parliament Smt Meenakshi Lekhi also addressed the audience. She appreciated Directorate General Defence Estates and Cantonment Board for making all 62 Cantonments across the country open defecation free. Secretary (Defence Finance) Smt Gargi Kaul, Director General of Defence Estates Smt Deepa Bajwa, General Officer Commanding, Headquarters Delhi Area Lt General Asit Mistry, Controller General of Defence Accounts Shri Sanjiv Mittal and other senior officials of the Ministry were also present there.

School children rendered “Vaishnav jan to” and depicted themes dear to Mahatma Gandhi in the sprawling gardens.

                The 94th Raising Day of the Military Nursing Service (MNS) is being celebrated today. Additional Director General (MNS) Major General Joyce Gladys Roach; Principal Matron, Army Hospital (Referral & Research) Major General Sonali Ghoshal laid wreath and paid homage to martyrs at National War Memorial this afternoon. Nursing officers once again rededicated themselves to render high quality, selfless nursing care to their patients by reading the Florence Nightingale Pledge on the occasion.

 

The MNS is the only all women corps in the Armed Forces. It came into being on March 28, 1888 with the arrival of first batch of 10 qualified British Nurses in Bombay (now Mumbai), to organise nursing in Military hospitals in India.  In 1893 it was designated as Indian Army Nursing Service (IANS) and in 1902 as Queen Alexandra Military Nursing Service (QAMNS). In 1914 for the first time Nurses were enrolled in India and were attached to QAMNS.

 

On October 1, 1926, a permanent Nursing Service for the Indian troops was formed and was designated as the Indian Military Nursing Service (IMNS).  The IMNS made a humble beginning and their work was universally acclaimed. On September 15, 1943, the IMNS officers became a part of the Indian Army and the members of service became Commissioned Officers. The organisation is headed at the Army Headquarters by ADG MNS at the Rank of Maj General and at command level by Brigadier MNS in the rank of Brigadier.

 

Enrolment into the Military Nursing Service is based on the merit selection at all India level. The candidates are enrolled at six Colleges of Nursing for Basic BSc (N) from various health sciences universities. On successful completion of the course they are granted Permanent or Short Service Commission in the Military Nursing Service in the rank of Lieutenant.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh today emphasised on the importance of financial prudence in an emerging economy like India, saying that any mismanagement like “in our neighborhood” can lead to fiscal chaos. In his address at the annual day celebrations of Defence Accounts Department (DAD), Ministry of Defence, Raksha Mantri said, “Our neighbor is a living example of financial mismanagement”. He said, excessive militarisation and focus on wrong policies in the neighborhood has led to a situation where a country could be blacklisted by international agency, Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for terror financing and its Prime Minister is struggling to arrange even for a plane to attend a global event.

Shri Rajnath Singh said, national security has today become a multi-dimensional concept, with economic strength, energy, food security and environmental protection among others being its key dimensions. Asserting that the Government is sensitive towards adapting to the changing environment, Shri Rajnath Singh assured that all barriers that come in the way of development will be removed. He said, he is interacting with the Armed Forces, scientists and defence experts in different parts of the country to understand their working and find ways to improve them. He emphasised on positive interpretation on rules to avoid delays in government projects, keeping in mind the welfare of jawans working in far-flung areas.

“There is a need to institutionalise the outcomes of successful models and work on the failures of the unsuccessful ones”, Raksha Mantri said. He stressed on harnessing best practices and convert them into ‘standard operation protocol’.

Declaring that employees of Ministry of Defence are his family, Raksha Mantri lauded DAD for efficiently accounting and utilising the huge Defence Budget and assuring that the soldiers receive their entitled financial benefits within stipulated time. He appreciated the Online Jet-Fuel Accounting System (OJAS) developed by a team of DAD, under which the bill payment of IOCL has been digitised using e-billing system. He said, Rs. 21 crores saved from the system in the first year itself could be utilised for preparing a road map for Oil PSUs and other components for MoD. 

Shri Rajnath Singh appreciated the efforts of the department, especially for more than 32 lakh pensioners and in facilitating faster financial decision making. He hailed DAD for setting up a Call Centre for Defence Pensioners as well as Pension Adalats in remote areas. “In 2018-19, 19 Defence Pension Adalats were organised. I am extremely happy to note that the employee satisfaction in those adalats was 99.75%”, he said. Raksha Mantri stressed on devising a mechanism, under Digital India, where all problems are dealt automatically with full sensitivity and pensioners do not have to go from pillar to post in this regard.

Shri Rajnath Singh expressed confidence that a Comprehensive Pension Package System for defence pensioners, to be rolled out next year, will further increase the employee satisfaction as all pension related problems will come under one digital platform. He praised the Defence Accounts Department for implementing One Rank One Pension (OROP) with high professionalism.

Emphasising on regular training of staff and officers, Raksha Mantri hoped the e-learning portal ‘GyanSudha’, developed by National Defence Financial Management Academy, Pune, will help DAD impart its services in a time bound manner.

In his address, Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik highlighted the history of the department and lauded its expansion with changing times and varying needs.

Controller General of Defence Accounts, Shri Sanjiv Mittal introduced Vision - 2024 of the department, a series of five projects including pensions, vendors’ payment, budget management, pay & allowances and an innovative Defence Travel System.

Shri Rajnath Singh also gave away Raksha Mantri Excellence awards for employees of the department showing exemplary performance standards. This year, the awards were given to a team of Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (PCDA), Air Force, New Delhi for Online Jet Fuels Accounting System (OJAS); team of National Academy of Defence Financial Management (NADFM), Pune for GyanSudha – an e-learning & examination portal; and a team of PCDA, Allahabad for Revision of Pension for Pre-2016 Defence Pensioners. A statistical Handbook was also released on the occasion.

Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh, Secretary (Defence Finance) Smt Gargi Kaul and officers of DAD and MoD were present on the occasion.

Defence Accounts Department is one of the oldest departments under Government of India. It is responsible for complete finance and internal audit functions not only for defence service viz Army, Navy & Air Force but other related organisations like DRDO, Ordnance Factories, Border Roads, Coast Guard and the canteen stores departments. The department has presence across the length and breadth of the country through its more than 11,000 offices at 250 locations.

The Minister said that a team of high level officials of the MDoNER had recently visited the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir, where commercial exploitation of bamboo grown in the region was discussed with the State officials, among many other issues. It has now been decided that the model for bamboo cultivation, harvesting and utilisation currently existing in the North Eastern Region shall be replicated in the two new Union Territories to give a fillip to the sector. The project for setting up three new Bamboo Technology Parks in Jammu, Srinagar and Leh would be in consonance with the National Bamboo Mission (NBM). A Bamboo Industrial Park has already been approved to be set up in the Dima Hasao district of Assam. 



Dr. Jitendra Singh also reviewed progress of preparation of the upcoming event “Destination North East” scheduled to be held at Varanasi from 23rd to 26th November, 2019.   He also reviewed the progress of the projects for setting up two hostels and a convention centre for the students and people of the North Eastern Region at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Rohini and Dwarka in Delhi. 



The Secretary, Ministry of DoNER, Dr. Inder Jit Singh, Secretary, North Eastern Council (NEC), Shri Ram Muivah, and Senior Officers of the Ministry and  NEC were present in the meeting.

                Union Minister of State for Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (Independent Charge) and Minister of State for Prime Minister's Office, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Departments of Atomic Energy and Space, Dr.Jitendra Singh presided over as Chief Guest at the Curtain Raiser event for the North East Expo 2019, organised in New Delhi today. The Regional Commissioners of the 8 North East states also attended the curtain raiser event.

The All India Women’s Education Fund Association (AIWEFA) organized the event.To celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's 150thbirth anniversary, 100 years of his association with Khadi and 91 years of AIWEFA’s service to women and communities, the campaign ‘Khadi Goes Global’ has been initiated. It brings together all the eight states of northeast India to create a platform with the North East Handloom, Handicrafts and the Farm Sector, at the North East Expo, 2019, on 2–3 November, 2019.

Khadi is a symbol of women’s empowerment as most of the spinners, weavers and handicraft artisans in the northeast are women. Hence, it is important to bring Khadi to the mainstream as it will help weavers, especiallywomen, continue to create more jobs.

Addressing the event, Dr. Singh said that in the last 5 years, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi visited North East over 30 times, which shows the kind of importance this government attaches with the states of the North East.

The Minister observed that this importance given by the government has bridged the gaps of growth and development in North East as well as broken psychological barriers in the minds of the people. “The government has managed to bring the rest of India closer to the North East”, he added. 

Dr. Singh talked about the steps being taken by the Union government for the development of the North East. He informed how the transport infrastructure, including rail tracks, highways, airports, had increased exponentially in the last 5 years with the constant interest being taken by the Prime Minister.

The Minister said that 35% of total bamboo production in India comes from the North East, but it was not utilised due to obsolete laws. Due to visionary leadership of the Prime Minister, bamboo was exempted from the Forest Act and it could be utilized for commercial use and boost handicrafts of the North East. “This government under the leadership of the Prime Minister believes in the conviction to think for the last man rather than going by any other consideration”, the Minister said.

Dr. Singh informed how 'Start up India, Stand up India' programme has led to young entrepreneurs in the North East starting their ventures by utilising the human and material resources in these states. ""The day is not far when the North East would become the start up hub of the country"", he said. 

Dr. Singh also talked about how the government is planning to replicate the success stories of development of North East in Jammu & Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370.

Talking about making ‘Khadi Go Global’, Dr. Singh put forward the vision of using latest technology in boosting the production of khadi and making it competitive globally. This would also help in generating immense employment opportunities in this sector, he added.

The North East Expo, 2019, will provide a platform for entrepreneurs from the eight northeast states to open up trade and commerce with ASEAN and BIMSTEC nations through Tea Diplomacy and Khadi Diplomacy. It will include panel discussions, back-to-back meetings, art, culture, food stalls, and stalls on northeast handlooms and handicrafts. This event also aims to identify and carry out preservation of the distinctive arts of the different tribes of the North East.

The objective of panel discussions is to analyse the current state of unique foodproducts, Handlooms and Handicrafts from the North East region. The panel willfurther look to understand its contribution to the local economy, identify issuesand challenges concerning their sustainability and outline measures needed forstrengthening and promoting the unique ecosystem globally.

At the expo, AIWEFA will also introduce two awards—The Prime Minister’s Award for Master Weaver and the other for the Master Crafts person for the year 2018–19.

                The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, Brig (Retd) B D Mishra called on Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and discussed a wide range of issues, particularly cadre related and other issues pertaining to the State.

The Governor reiterated the demand by the Arunachal Pradesh State government, including Chief Minister Shri Pema Khandu to have a separate IAS cadre for the State of Arunachal Pradesh, which is presently a part of the AGMUT cadre, shared by Union territories and the States of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Goa. He said, this demand is motivated by the increasing requirement of IAS officers for the State as well as by the consideration of having officers exclusively designated to serve in the State. 

In view of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh also likely to become part of the AGMUT cadre after 31st of October, Brig Mishra requested to explore the possibility of excluding the States out of it, since two new Union territories will get added to the cadre from next month.

Dr Jitendra Singh conveyed to the Governor that he has already instructed the Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) to undertake an exercise to explore the possibility as well as feasibility of the demand put forward by the Arunachal Pradesh government. He said, since the Union territories fall under the domain  of Ministry of Home Affairs, an option, if any, will require to be discussed with the Home Ministry as well. However, we shall try to take up the issue with the Home Ministry also for their view, he added.  

Meanwhile, the DoNER Minister informed the Governor that most of  the pending Centrally funded projects for Arunachal Pradesh have been cleared and are progressing satisfactorily.  He informed that the land for the first ever airport for Arunachal Pradesh has also been acquired and the work on it is likely to start soon. Another landmark project of the State will be the upcoming Film and Television Institute which was approved by the Modi government in  its first term and is possibly going to be the first institute of its kind after a similar institute that already exists in Pune, he added.

For promotion of tourism, the DoNER  Minister shared with the Governor, a number of new initiatives envisaged by the Modi government.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah inaugurated the North East Handloom and Handicraft Exhibition in Aizawl, Mizoram today. Also gracing the occasion were Chief Minister of Mizoram, Shri Zoramthanga and Union Minister of State (IC) for Development of North Eastern Region and Minister of State for Prime Minister's Office, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Departments of Atomic Energy and Space, Dr.Jitendra Singh.

 



 

Addressing at the event, the Home Minister expressed happiness to visit one of the most beautiful states in India and called it an important representative of Indian Democracy. ""Once affected by insurgency and separatism, today Mizoram stands as a symbol of peace and fraternity and is giving this message to the whole World"", he added.

Shri Shah said that this is the first Handloom and Handicraft Exhibition being organised in the North East. Handloom holds the capability to generate huge employment opportunities in the North East and play an important role in the growth and development of the people, he said.

 



 

Shri Shah observed that India's North East is rich in availability of forest produce and other raw materials for the handloom and handicraft sector. Combining this with the traditional culture of making handicrafts and presence of skilled people, he said, handicrafts can play a pioneering role in the development of the North East.

The Home Minister said that during the first NarendraModi Government, Bamboo was taken out of the list of trees that were prohibited for felling due to environmental concerns. With this decision, the availability of Bamboo has been increased to facilitate the handicrafts sector by the government. The region that would benefit the most would be the North East, he added.

 



 

Talking about the steps taken under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri NarendraModi to make the North East prosper, Shri Shah said that the PM has worked day and night to initiate whole of the North East on a path of peace and prosperity. In Mizoram, in the last 5 years, a number of developmental projects have been initiated which include 60 MW Tuirialhydro electric power project. The Home Minister also expressed confidence that by 2021, Aizawl would be connected by broadgauge railways. The Kaladan multi modal waterway and establishing of new border hats would bring huge opportunities of trade and commerce to Mizoram. Other initiatives that have been initiated in Aizawl are Greater Aizawl water project, state referral hospital, state sports academy, horticulture colleges and a cricket stadium, he added.

 



 

Drawing a comparison with the previous government, Shri Shah said that Mizoram received over Rs. 19,970 crores during 13th Finance Commission (FC), whereas, during the 14th FC, over Rs. 42, 970 crores have been spent by the Modi Government for Mizoram's development. He also gave details of progress on various flagship schemes of Goverment of India like LPG connections under PM UjjwalaYojana, houses under PM AwasYojana, bank accounts opened under PM Jan Dhanyojana, loans given to Mizo youth under PM Mudra yojana, building of national highways, household electrification and construction of toilets in Mizoram. Today, Mizoram is a totally open defecation free state, he noted with pride.

Stressing on the importance the government gives to the development of the North East, Shri Shah said, ""NarendraModi Government is totally committed to ensure development of Mizoram and to find solutions to all kinds of challenges that the state is facing"". He concluding the address by assuring the Mizoram CM of government of India's full cooperation and assistance in taking the state on the path of swift progress and development.

Addressing the event, Union Minister of State (IC) for DoNER said that the Central Government led by Prime Minister NarendraModi didn’t follow the dictum of vote bank politics. In its first tenure, the Modi government gave long list of projects to Mizoram including India’s first citrus fruit park and four border-haats, he said. Dr. Singh said that during the time of earlier governments, Prime Ministers often didn’t visit Mizoram but Prime Minister NarendraModi gave exclusive time to the state. He said that Home Minister Amit Shah also visited Mizoram within less than five months after becoming home minister. Dr. Singh said that now Mizoram is on the fast track of development and peace and development will increase in the state in time to come

Addressing the function, Mizoram chief minister Shri Zoramthanga said that despite lack of resources in the state, Mizoram is using available resources in fullest extent. He said that after 10 years Mizoram will be one of the state of the country with highest per capita. Assam’s Finance Minister HimantaBiswaSarma and other dignitaries were also present in the programme.

Speaking on the occasion Union HRD Minister said that the potential in our students is endless and the Pradhan Mantri Innovative Learning Programme aims at helping students to realize their potential to the fullest through the just concluded programme, in which multi-faceted support was provided over the course of fourteen days.

These students have displayed a superb record of physical and mental determination, as well as an immense respect and knowledge of varied aspects of Indian culture. They possess the skills and mind-sets required to make themselves, their families, and their country proud in their particular artistic pursuits. 

During the program all 60 students trained under the DHRUV programmeshowcased their talent via several performances.

                Union HRD Minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ chaired the 2nd meeting of the IIIT Coordination Forum in New Delhi today.Indian Institute of information Technology  (IIITs) Coordination Forum is the apex body for deciding policy and directions for 20 IIITs established under PPP mode. These IIITs are partially supported by Government.They are required to become self sufficient in a short span of time.

The HRD Minister who is also the Chairman of the IIIT Councilhighlighted the important developments at the national level. He particularly focused on economic transformation to US$ 5 Trillion economy by 2024. He empathized the role of IIITs in achieving economic transformation and incorporating social development.           

He advised the Directors of IIITs to create a Vision and Mission and lead the institutions towards achieving them by suitably involving industry and other stakeholders. In order to develop required qualities for managing change, Directors of IIITs will undergo Leadership Development Programme in India and aboard. Such training shall include strategic planning, financial management, creating and managing teams and other relevant topics.

Further, he desired IIITs to focus on Innovation and Entrepreneurship which could be the basis for transformation. IIITs are advised to take up formal programme through subjects of study through minor specialization in Entrepreneurship Development, conduct workshops on ideation/innovation and to set up incubation facilities. He advised institutes to seek support through schemes such as Atal Innovation Mission, TIDE 2 etc.

The Chairman assured all possible support to these IIITs through policies and funding with the approval of the cabinet. He encouraged partnership among these IIITs at the faculty and students level through various curricular and co-curricular activities. 

It was also desired that each IIIT should focus on a thrust area which are directly linked to disruptive applications in various domains such as manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare etc. through Industry 4.0 technologies. 

The major decisions taken during the meeting include entrepreneurship development and syncing with new trends in technology in the course curriculum so that these Institutions become global Institutes. Each IIIT needs to identify their unique thrust area so that they take up development of the Institute in that direction. The Forum desired that faculty being the most important resource, must be evaluated regularity to ensure that the students get good education and compete with the best in the world. The Forum decided to grant notional HAG scale to the Directors recruited for Centrally funded Institutes. However, the State Governments will also be requested to provide the same to their faculty while being appointed as Directors of IIITs. It was also decided to speed up the proposal for training of Directors of IIITs, and interaction with industry. 

The Coordination Forum authorised Hon’ble HRM as Chairperson of the Forum to make short term arrangement of Director in a IIIT in case of vacancy, on temporary basis.

The Forum emphasised the need of effective collaboration among IIITs (CFTIs & PPP) and IITs to share and learn about best practices. He also emphasised about enhanced interaction and involvement of industry. The Chairman advised the IIITs to organise meet of Director of IIITs and industry in coordination with NASSCOM for this purpose.

Another major consideration of the Forum was to enhance the budgetary support to each IIIT by Rs. 50 Cr. Towards capital and Rs. 10 Cr. toward revenue to enable them to meet the increase in cost of material and manpower over the decade. The Forum decided that the proposal may be examined by the Ministry. 

In a major move to support weaker students who are admitted to IIITs, the Forum advised the IIITs to provide options to such students to opt for BSc degree in the respective disciplines, so that they get the basic degree and look for appropriate employment opportunities.

                Union HRD Minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ chaired the 4th meeting of the IndianInstituteofinformationTechnology(IIITs) Council in New Delhi today.At the outset, the Chairman stressed on the need of leapfrogging by IIITs in order to become world class Institutes. The IIITs should compete with the best Institutes in the world so that the international students prefer our country over others for niche courses, unique and latest curriculum and best faculty. At the same time Indian students should also get the education of international quality in the country itself. 

He also emphasized about the social responsibility of these Institutes. He exhorted the Directors to participate in the Government Schemes such as Unnat Bharat, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, Fit India Movements, Water Conservation, Tree Plantation, Adoption of nearby villages etc.The main decisions taken by the Council include allowing IIIT students to join Integrated M. Tech/MBA at other IIITs subject to fulfillment of minimum CPI criteria. 

The Council also approved lateral movement of students of one IIIT to another IIIT or any other foreign Institute for short periods (during summer or internship). Similarly, faculty can also move to another IIIT for a semester or half a semester in order to tide over the shortage of faculty. It was also decided to start joint degree (PhD) program with other IIITs in linewith IITs. 

The Chairman was also authorized to appoint a Director in case of vacancy for short periods, on temporary charge. Another important decision was taken by the Council to grant tuition fee waiver to PWD students. It was also decided to inculcate entrepreneurship among students. The Chairman desired that each Institute must identify or specific domain of expertise for themselves based on which their national and International branding would be done. 

Shri V K Modi, Shri Deepak Ghaisas, Prof. Sadagopan, Prof. H A Ranganath, Prof Ashok Jhunjhunwala were among the prominent persons present in the meeting. Dr. Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, Additional Secretary (Technical Education), being the Secretary of the Council, conducted the proceedings of the meeting.

In addition to the headquarters located in Delhi, the Board has a vocational examination unit at Preet Vihar, Academic and Skills Education Unit at Rouse Avenue and Regional Office and CTET Unit at Patparganj, Delhi.

In order to maintain better coordination among the various branches / units of the Board in Delhi and to meet the increasing challenges due to increase in the number of CBSE affiliated schools, the Board had earlier proposed to create an integrated office complex in Delhi and for this purpose, a plot of three acres of land was purchased from the Development Authority of Delhi at Sector-23, Dwarka, Delhi. 

The board's proposed integrated campus building will be a state-of-the-art building while fulfilling the green building norms. Some of the special features of the building complex will include the installation of efficient building management system that will facilitate energy conservation. Solar panels will be installed that will produce300KWH of electricity from the roof of the building. A sewage treatment plan has also been proposed for flushing in toilets and reuse of gray water in landscaping. These facilities being included in the integrated campus will also contribute towards environmental protection. The latest security features have been taken care of in the design of the building. The 12,000 square meter building is estimated to be completed in period of approx. 24 months.

                For seamless and effective dissemination of emergency information and communication on disaster warnings, Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) and Ocean States Forecasts (OSF) to fishermen, the Government today launched the Gagan Enabled Mariner’s Instrument for Navigation and Information (GEMINI) device. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony in New Delhi, Union Minister for Earth Sciences, Science & Technology and Health & Family Welfare, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said “The satellite based communication is the only suitable solution for the dissemination of such emergency information and affordable satellite based communication system should be made part of the dissemination chain to deal with cyclones, high waves and tsunamis”.

 



While PFZ Advisories provide information on the probable locations on fish aggregation in the seas, OSF provide the accurate state of the ocean. The Minister pointed out that “Ocean State Forecasts include the forecasts on winds, waves, ocean currents, water temperature, etc. at every 6 hrs on daily basis for next 5 days helping fishermen in maximizing their earnings, ensuring safety and in planning of fishing activities”.

Though the advisories and forecasts are disseminated through multiple communication modes, none of them could provide such information, including the disaster warnings when the fishermen move away from the coast beyond 10-12 km (typical ranges of mobile phones and VHF). That remained as a major limitation in disseminating the information to fishermen who go in the sea beyond 50 nautical miles; sometimes up to 300 nautical miles and beyond to conduct multiday fishing.

This lacuna was severely felt during the Ockhi cyclone in 2017, when fishermen went out, for deep sea fishing before the onset of the cyclone and could not be informed about the developing cyclone. This communication gap resulted in loss of life, serious injuries to those rescued and severe damages to fishing boats and fishing gear.

To overcome this difficulty, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), an autonomous body under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) joined hands with Airports Authority of India (AAI) to utilize the GAGAN (GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation) satellite system to transmit the PFZ, OSF and disaster warnings to fishermen with GAGAN system consisting of three geosynchronous satellites (GSAT-8, GSAT-10 and GSAT-15).  GAGAN foot-print covers the entire Indian Ocean round the clock. To receive the messages transmitted through the GAGAN satellites, INCOIS together with AAI developed a low-cost GAGAN system-enabled GEMINI (GAGAN Enabled Mariner's Instrument for Navigation and Information) device and electronically designed and manufactured by a private industry M/S Acord, Bangalore under Make in India Program. The GEMINI device receives and transfers the data received from GAGAN satellite/s to a mobile through Bluetooth communication. A mobile application developed by INCOIS decodes and displays the information in nine regional languages.  

On the occasion, Dr. Harsh Vardhan also inaugurated the PFZ forecasts, newly developed by INCOIS which will provide advisories on PFZ to fishermen 3 days in advance. The Minister stated “PFZ advisories have become part of the value chain of the fishing community, over 6 lakh fishermen are regularly accessing advisories directly through their mobiles to avoid the wastage of time for searching shoals of fish”. The PFZ forecasts are generated using numerical models operationalized by INCOIS and helps overcome the operational difficulties in providing the PFZ advisories during overcast skies based on satellite data.



Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Shri Pradeep Singh Kharola; Secretary, MoES, Dr. Madhavan Nair Rajeevan; Chairman, AAI, Shri Anuj Aggarwal; Member, National Disaster Management Authority, Lt Gen N C Marwah and Director, INCOIS, Dr. Satheesh C. Shenoi were also present at the event.

                Union Minister of Law & Justice, Communications and Electronics & Information Technology, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad had today unveiled a series of new initiatives by Ministry of Electronics & Information (MeitY) in the first MeitY Start-up Summit held today at New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion Shri Ravi Shakar Prasad stressed that there is great maturity of the movement called ‘Digital India’ today under the visionary leadership of Shri Narendra Modi. He gave the mantra of “Reform, perform, transform"" as the key focus areas for the Government. In India’s journey of transformation technology is playing a big role. Digital India, Make in India, startup India, Smart cities are all technology based programmes designed to reform. He further articulated the idea of Digital India which is based essentially on 3 premises. It is designed to empower, bridge the gap between digital haves, have-nots and finally technology must be low cost, developmental and produced in India.  For Digital India to be competitive the Government must also be competitive. Towards this, entities such as NIC and STPI have to play a crucial role.  Buoyed by concerted efforts over the years Digital India is now having a global resonance with many countries wanting to emulate the model.

Stressing the importance of JAM Trinity he said with 1.24 billion Aadhar cards, 1.2 billion mobile phones are riding its own story of success in the digital inclusion. 

eNam, e-Visas, Digital payments all have shown tremendous maturity and growth. 

Stressing the importance of startups he said that if India has to grow it can’t do without startups. He said that steps are being taken up to include startups in the e-procurement portal of GoI.   

Shir Ravi Shankar Prasad stressed the need for empowering common women of India for a successful digital inclusion process. The Common Service Centres are already doing a great job in empowering women.  Praising the women entrepreneurs he said that today’s awards are a celebration of their contribution to further technology. The list of women awardees in six thematic areas of technology empowerment is attached.  

In an effort to percolate the vision of Digital India to reach the tier 2, 3 4 and mofussil towns of India 200 BPOs are now operating across India. Imphal, Patna, Malda, Bareilly, Jalgaon Ghaziabad are some of the places where these centres have been opened. 

To strengthen the digital infrastructure in villages 1.25 Lakh Gram Panchayats have been connected by optical fibre. Today there are 1 Lakh digital villages with wifi connectivity and CSCs. He exhorted MeitY to come out with digital cataloguing of indigenous products with special emphasis on products developed by rural artisans.  

To conclude he said India must become a huge centre of software products and hub for intellectual property. By harnessing the power of technology nobody can stop India from being a superpower. 

On TIDE scheme he said that it had made some remarkable achievements in the promotion of startups in the country and now with TIDE 2.0 more avenues would open up for startups. 

Earlier in the day Shri Prasad awarded the selected fintechs and Banks in promotion of the digital landscape in the country and also awarded outstanding women tech entrepreneurs.

Also leading technology leaders and Secretary MeitY in the 3 panel discussions stressed the need for greater government-academia-industry partnership to take forward deep tech entrepreneurship for socio-economic growth of the country.  All were of the unanimous view that the various public platforms created under the Digital India programme have created opportunities for India to be the technology leader for low cost solutions.

                The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi with great fervour and spirit. To honour this special occasion, MeitY observed week long activities themed as ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’, from September 23 – October 2, 2019 with active participation from MeitY’s officers and staff members. A day-wise Action Plan for implementation was prepared of which “Plastic Waste Management and effective ban of Single Use Plastic” was a crucial drive involving the community at large.

 

Speaking on this special occasion, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon’ble Minister for Electronics and IT, Communications and Law & Justice, said “We are committed to move towards a Plastic Free work place. The Government machinery is in full swing to cut down Single Use Plastic by 2020”. 

 

He said Gandhian philosophy continuous to be equally relevant for the harmonious growth of the society. All Departments under the Ministry of Electronic & IT should come forward to imbibe teachings of Gandhi in day to day life. This will not only help in expediting accomplishment of Swatch Bharat goal but also help in the empowerment of women and improving governance. Sh. Prasad directed NIC to prominently place at least one thought of Gandhi ji in each website that NIC is managing. He said this will bring about Gandhian approach in the functioning of Government.

 

Shri Prasad launched a film showcasing the activities executed by the Ministry which are aligned with Gandhi ji’s philosophy of cleanliness, inclusion of the marginalised population in the country, hard work, and dedication to lead the country towards Good Governance. 

 

The Government is implementing different welfare programmes/ schemes at various levels for the citizen’s benefit. Effective monitoring and measurement of the outcome and impact of such programmes/ schemes is imperative at different levels through identified Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The Hon’ble Minister inaugurated an Automated Real Time Performance Smart-board which has been developed by MeitY. This Performance Smart-board is a single window access for Centre, State or District specific projects implemented by MeitY. It will provide real-time, dynamic analytical project monitoring for critical and high priority Programme/Schemes of MeitY. The smart-board will enhance analysis through data integration (using APIs/web services) by consolidating multiple data sources into one centralized, easy-to-access platform. This automated real-time performance smart-board will promote transparency and enhance ease of working.  

 

Paying homage to the Mahatma, Shri Prasad unveiled the ‘Digital Charkha’, a grand art installation at MeitY. Glittering in its tri-colour splendour, the Digital Charkha is an amalgamation of the traditional design with a digital spin. The wheel of the Charkha is made up of interlinked digital grids in place of fine threads thus portraying that the core of Digital India is embedded in Gandhian philosophy of equality, unity, corruption free and empowerment of ordinary citizens. This philosophy resonates with the Prime Minister’s vision for a NEW DIGITAL INDIA that promises to deliver e-Governance services as basic fundamental rights to each and every citizen of the country. 

 

Keeping with Gandhi ji’s philosophy for a clean environment, the Minister and senior MeitY officials took to brooms and cleaned the office building with great gusto. Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad administered a Swachhta Pledge to all officers and staff members. Planting saplings on the lush green lawns at MeitY premises, Shri Prasad reminisced about the Mahatma’s desire for a clean and green Swachh Bharat. 

 

Mahatma Gandhi had said that Cleanliness is next to Godliness. And MeitY’s contribution towards an inclusive, progressive and an empowered Swachh Bharat is the real tribute to Bapu on his 150th Birth Anniversary.

                Realizing the importance of the Indian Himalayan region and recognizing the need to study its ecology, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar approved the proposal of setting-up of a New Regional Centre of the GB Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment & Development at Ladakh. 

As the setting up of the Centre is being envisaged concurrently with Ladakh being designated as a separate Union Territory (UT), the Institute is expected to have an institutional linkage with the Ladakh Administration right from its inception.  This association would be mutually beneficial (i) to the Institute through the facilitation of UT government for setting-up of the centre (i.e., appropriate space for work initiation, land for own campus and technology park/demonstrations) and (ii) aligning the centre’s activities with priorities and needs of newly created UT.

The setting-up of this centre would ensure Institute's Research & Development outreach in entire Trans Himalayan zone of Indian Himalaya by way of targeting following objectives: 


	To promote alternative and innovative livelihoods for climate change vulnerable cold-desert communities;
	To facilitate conservation of critical/important cold desert habitats and  biodiversity;
	To strengthen and establish approaches for addressing issues of water  scarcity and
	To  foster climate smart communities in the trans-Himalayan landscape


The GB Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment and Sustainable Development with its Headquarters at Kosi-Katarmal (Uttarakhand) and Regional Centres (RCs) as Himachal RC at Mohal-Kullu, Himachal Pradesh. (to cover J&K and H.P.), Garhwal RC at Srinagar (to cover Uttarakhand), Sikkim RC at Pangthang, Gangtok (to cover Sikkim and W.B. hills), Northeast RC at Itanagar (to cover remaining NE States) caters to environment management, conservation of natural resources and policies for sustainable development of communities in the Indian Himalayan Region.

It is noteworthy to mention that the Trans Himalayan landscape has most of its area lying above 3,000 Mean sea level (msl) and is characterized by extreme cold climate, minimal rain (9-10cm annual, more than 300 sunny days) and with very sparse vegetation. This landscape, most often, is also termed as clod desert. The region is endowed with rich diversity of culture, unique biodiversity elements and significantly large wetlands/water bodies (lakes). The Centre will help in better understanding of its landscape components and developing strategies and implementation plans for addressing issues of environmental conservation, people's livelihoods and sustainable development under changing scenario.

                The Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Shri Prakash Javadekar participated in the 29th ministerial meeting of the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China) countries on Climate Change at Beijing, China on 25th-26th October 2019.



Following is the Joint Statement issued today at the Conclusion of 29th BASIC Ministerial Meet on Climate Change: 


	The 29th BASIC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change was held in Beijing, China, on 25th-26th October 2019. The meeting was chaired by H.E. Mr. LI Ganjie, Minister of Ecology and Environment of the People’s Republic of China, attended by H.E. Mr. XIE Zhenhua, Special Representative for Climate Change Affairs of China, and


H.E. Mr. Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Information and Broadcasting of the Republic of India, Mr. Roberto Castelo Branco, National Secretary for International Relations, Ministry of the Environment of Brazil, and Mr. Maesela Kekana, Chief Director of International Climate Change Relations and Negotiations of the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries of the Republic of South Africa. In line with the ‘BASIC-plus’ approach, H.E. Ammar Hijazi, Ambassador of the state of Palestine, on behalf of the Chair of the Group of 77 and China, and Mr. Mauricio Carabelli of Chile, on behalf of the incoming Presidency of COP25 also attended the meeting as Guests.

 


	BASIC Ministers expressed their concern for the global challenge of climate change and its adverse effects, and confirmed their commitments to multilateralism in order to address the issue and to foster climate resilience and promote greenhouse gas emissions reduction, low-carbon and sustainable development, with a view to collectively working towards preparedness of international community for the wellbeing of all. Ministers underscored that all parties should jointly defend the international system underpinned by the United Nations, in accordance with the principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), in the light of different national circumstances. Unilateralism and protectionism undermine the open and free international trade system and the prospect of global economic development and growth, which will end up with damaging global efforts against climate change. It is imperative to focus on safeguarding the multilateral process and the fulfillment of commitments.


 


	Ministers emphasized the faithful and comprehensive implementation of the Paris Agreement, in particular of its goals and principles, and underlined the importance of a full, effective and sustained implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol and its Paris Agreement, in accordance with the principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), in the light of different national circumstances, as well as the nationally- determined nature of the Paris Agreement. They emphasized that global climate action should promote climate justice by recognizing the fundamental equality of all people in accessing economic growth and sustainable development. The BASIC Ministers reaffirmed and emphasized the need for people’s participation and climate friendly lifestyles for addressing the challenge of climate change acknowledging that Paris Agreement embodies and calls for sustainable lifestyles and consumption patterns.


 


	Ministers highlighted that developing countries, including BASIC countries, notwithstanding the multiple challenges including food security, poverty eradication, and insufficient and uneven progress of domestic


 


development, have been implementing ambitious climate action based on their national circumstances in the context of sustainable development, and have achieved great progress with significant contribution to global efforts in combating climate change. In 2018, China has reduced carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 45.8% from the 2005 level, increased the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to 14.3%. South Africa has recently implemented carbon tax, and announced massive renewable energy program in its latest electricity plan. India has already achieved 21% reduction in emission intensity of GDP in 2014 compared to 2005 levels, thereby achieving its pre-2020 voluntary target. In 2015, Brazil had already achieved a 58% emission reduction in the business as usual scenario set for its NAMAs, thereby overachieving its target of 36%- 39% reductions set for 2020.

 


	Ministers noted UN Climate Action Summit and its strong political signal of upholding multilateralism, implementing the Paris Agreement, and enhancing ambitions of action and support. BASIC countries actively engaged and contributed, and are ready to further strengthen international cooperation to explore solutions which are cost-effective and with lower risks, such as nature-based solutions, and technology innovation in industry transition.


 


	Ministers expressed their appreciation to the Polish Presidency’s contribution to the conclusion of the bulk of the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP). They appreciated Costa Rica for hosting Pre-COP25 to promote political dialogue on specific issues. The Group pledged their full support to the incoming Chilean Presidency, and highlighted that the key outcome of COP25 will be to conclude negotiations on robust rules to ensure environmental integrity under Article 6 of Paris Agreement and to achieve progress on climate finance which is one of the key enablers for developing countries to implement ambitious climate actions. They committed to working with all other Parties for the success of COP25 in an open and transparent, consensus-based and party- driven manner.


 


	Ministers valued the 187 ratifications of the Paris Agreement to date, called on all remaining Parties to ratify, and welcomed the implementation of the Agreement in the post-2020 period. The Group also underscored Kyoto Protocol as the significant milestone in the multilateral climate process. Ministers also welcomed the 134 ratifications, to date, of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and recalled that only 10 acceptance instruments are outstanding for the amendment to enter into force. They urged the Parties that have not yet ratified the Doha Amendment to do so as soon as possible, striving for its prompt entry into force before COP25.


 


	The Group highlighted the substantial gaps not only in mitigation, but also in adaptation and support provided by developed countries to developing countries in the pre-2020 period. They stressed that these gaps should not be transferred to the post-2020 period to present additional burdens on developing countries. They urged developed countries to take urgent actions to close the gaps, including revisiting their targets on mitigation under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, and fulfilling their commitments of providing support to developing countries.


 


	Ministers underscored that as developing countries are the most adversely affected by climate change, adaptation is a key imperative but is neglected with imbalanced allocation of resources compared to mitigation. They reiterated that balanced allocation should be made for adaptation and mitigation in terms of support provided by developed countries, including through Green Climate Fund (GCF). The Group encouraged other fora, including the Global Commission on Adaptation to play their part in supporting developing countries on adaptation. They



 


emphasized that it is critical to dedicate a share of proceeds from ITMOs transactions under Article 6 to fund adaptation in developing countries.

 


	Ministers underlined their commitment to taking ambitious actions to implement their NDCs. They stressed that action and support are integral in terms of ambition, and the ambition of support by developed countries should match the ambition of action by developing countries. Developed countries shall provide new and additional, sustained, predictable, adequate and timely finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries, open markets and carry out practical technological cooperation, which serve the basis for mutual trust and important conditions for the comprehensive and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.


 


	Ministers expressed their deep concern on the insufficiency and inadequacy of the support provided by developed countries to date, and underlined that the climate finance should be new, additional, and with significant public funded component. They urged developed countries to fulfill their climate finance commitments of providing USD 100 billion annually by 2020 for developing countries in a transparent and grant-based manner.


 


	Ministers urged developed countries to propose the new collective quantified goal on finance as soon as possible, including detailed roadmap and timetable. The goal should be from a floor of USD 100 billion per year, significantly publicly funded and of greater transparency. The 2020 deliberations should draw lessons from the experience of meeting the USD 100 billion pledge, be informed by the needs and priorities of developing countries, and be adequate to meet the ambition of action of developing countries. In this regard, they stressed the importance of establishing a structured deliberation within the UNFCCC, in order to conclude this work in a meaningful and timely manner.


 


	Ministers noted with concern the significant gap in aspects including funding scale, eligibility and policy- making of the GCF and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) from the need of developing countries. They noted of the contributions made by some developed countries in the first replenishment of the GCF, and urged the other developed countries to make speedy and robust contributions, to ensure the first replenishment doubles the initial resource mobilization pledge in real terms.


 


	The Group highlighted that providing information on transparency of support, including its predictability, is a key component of the Enhanced Transparency Framework. In this regard, Ministers urged developed countries to engage in discussion to formulate clear guidance for the biennial communication which has common tables for communicating such information, referred to Article 9.5 in a positive and constructive manner.


 


	Ministers underscored the importance of concluding the discussions on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, in accordance with the mandates and principles set out in the Agreement and the accompanying decision, including ensuring environmental integrity and avoiding double counting. They restated that decisions on other subjects should not pre-empt discussions under Article 6, and the issues should be addressed in a balanced and inclusive manner.


 


	Ministers expressed that the rules and governance structures for cooperative approaches under Article 6.2 shall be multilaterally agreed and applicable to all Parties, and shall ensure that all transactions are based on actual



 

mitigation efforts, consistent with Article 2. A robust accounting system shall be put in place, which shall have flexibility to accommodate different types of NDCs and a central log to register all transactions.

 


	Ministers stated that the design of the mechanism under Article 6.4 shall be conducive to public and private sector involvement and avoid the creation of unnecessary obstacles to investment, provided that environmental integrity is ensured. Appropriate approaches, including corresponding adjustment and other possible means, should be explored to this end. Under no circumstances is the nationally determined nature of commitments and the bottom-up character of the Paris Agreement to be changed. They also stated that the ability of the climate change regime to ensure the appropriate transition of the CDM to the mechanism under Article 6.4 will be key to securing continued engagement of the public and private sectors in mitigation action.


 


	Ministers welcomed the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts based on the mandates, and emphasized the need to address loss and damage on the basis of equity and in accordance with the principles of CBDR-RC, the relevant provisions of the Paris Agreement and COP decisions.


 


	Ministers reiterated that the UNFCCC process remains the preeminent international forum for addressing matters related to climate change, and other fora serve as contributory supplement under the guidance of its principles and spirit. Ministers noted the work of International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International Civil Aviation (ICAO) on reduction of GHG emissions, and underlined that the work being undertaken must comply with the key principles of the UNFCCC process, in particular the principle of Equity and CBDR-RC.


 


	Ministers hailed the 10th anniversary of the BASIC Group and agreed to further strengthen the solidarity and cooperation among the four countries. In this context, they committed to jointly promote South-South cooperation, providing assistance as capabilities allow to enhance the capacities of other developing countries in addressing climate change. They reiterated their unequivocal support to the State of Palestine, as the Chair of the Group of 77 and China, with a view to strengthening the unity of the Group and advancing the common interests of developing countries.


 


	Ministers welcomed the offer of India to host the 30th BASIC Ministerial Meeting.

In a major boost towards protecting and conserving Snow Leopards, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Shri Prakash Javadekar launched the First National Protocol on Snow Leopard Population Assessment in India, on the occasion of International Snow Leopard Day.



Snow Leopard enumeration of the Nation, which is the first of its kind, has been developed by scientific experts in association with the Snow Leopard States/UTs namely, Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunanchal Pradesh.

Giving the key note address at the Inaugural session of the 4th steering committee meeting of the Global Snow Leopard & Ecosystem Protection (GSLEP) Program, today at New Delhi, Shri Javadekar dwelt upon range countries working collectively to conserve nature and enumerate the number of snow leopards. “We will strive to double the Snow leopards population in the world in the coming decade. This two-day Conference is important because discussions, deliberations, cooperation and learning from each other and sharing the best practices will benefit us all. Therefore, we can conserve nature in a better way and we can do positive work collectively”, stated the Environment Minister.



The Minister further informed about India’s success in tiger population with 2967 tigers i.e. 77 per cent of world’s tiger population residing in the country, wherein 26000 cameras were used to enumerate the near exact number. India is also home to 500 plus lions, 30000 plus elephants, 2500 plus single-horned rhinos. 

Shri Javadekar also expressed confidence that the deliberations will be successful in chalking out practical program and lead to winning the battle against climate change by preserving and improving nature and by multiplying the epitome of ecology that includes Leopards, Tigers, Lions, Elephants, Rhinos and all animal kingdom. The Minister said “We must start thinking about capacity building, livelihood, green economy, and green pathway even in the Snow Leopard areas of the Himalayan range and cross country cooperation. This forms the basis for all Snow Leopard range countries.”

Speaking at the Inaugural session, Secretary, MoEFCC, Shri C.K. Mishra also laid stress on the need for awareness and understanding value of Snow Leopard for the ecosystem. He said “These conferences provide an opportunity to learn about the best practices of other countries.  Discussions should center around habitat and ecosystem. Better ecosystem and creating better habitat is what we should strive for”.

It is noteworthy to mention that Snow Leopard is found in 12 countries. They are India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, Mongolia, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

The two day international meeting of GSLEP Program is being organized by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change at New Delhi on 23-24 October 2019.

The 4th Steering Committee meeting of the GSLEP is being attended by Ministers from Nepal, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia along with senior officials from nine of the Snow Leopard countries. The Steering Committee meeting of GSLEP chaired by Nepal and Co-Chaired by Kyrgyzstan, will be sharing their experiences to intensify collaborative efforts towards conserving the Snow Leopards and its ecosystem. The delegates will also be discussing sustainable development efforts to be made in the Snow Leopard habitats and take into consideration green economic development, innovative conservation financing and population assessment of global Snow Leopards. The Steering Committee will also assess efforts in combating poaching and illegal wildlife trade of Snow Leopards.

Efforts of the Central Pollution Control Board are resulting in more 'good days' in terms of environment in the National Capital Region of Delhi.  Giving details at a Press Conference in New Delhi today, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar, said that a high level meeting of the five States to address the problem of air pollution in Delhi, due to stubble burning will be held soon. To control stubble burning, the government has given more than 20 thousand machines to farmers in Punjab and Haryana at a cost of about Rs.1150 crore, the Minister said. 

 

Shri Javadekar said “Recognition of existence of a problem is beginning of solution of the problem. The pollution problem of Delhi-NCR started aggravating since 2006 and was not recognized till 2014. In 2015, under the supervision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Air Quality Index (AQI) was launched. Today, 113 AQI monitoring stations are present in Delhi-NCR and 29 more are to be installed soon”. The Minister highlighted that out of 273 days till 30th September in 2019, number of ‘Good’, ‘Satisfactory’ and ‘Moderate’ days were 165 as against 104 in 2016.

 



 

The Minister further informed that Bharat Stage Six (BS VI), is a revolutionary step in the transformation of fuels. He added that there has been 80% reduction in Particulate Matter emissions and 30% reduction in Nitrogen Oxides emissions in BS IV heavy duty diesel vehicles compared with BS III norms. Nearly ₹60,000 Cr were spent on switching over to BS VI fuels. “The Country will shift to BS VI vehicular emission norms from BS IV by April 2020. BS VI petrol/diesel is already available in Delhi/NCR”, said Shri Javadekar.

 

Terming the launch of green fire crackers with green logo and QR coding system on Saturday, a historic initiative, the Minister advised not to burst crackers this Diwali. However if one chooses to, then opt for the green crackers which is aimed at reducing pollution and health risks, Shri Javadekar said. 

 

Pointing out various efforts undertaken to control pollution, Shri Javadekar stated ""From today onwards, 46 teams of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) are taking stock of pollution levels in Delhi-NCR and will take appropriate action wherever needed”.

 

The Minster highlighted that the creation of Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways, completed at cost of about ₹17000 Cr, has now led to 40000 goods vehicles, which are not destined for Delhi, to be diverted away from national capital, leading to a great positive impact on pollution. 

 

Talking of initiatives relating to e-mobility and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation network, Shri Javadekar said, 377 Km of metro lines with 274 stations, is catering to more than 30 lakh passengers daily in an environmentally friendly manner.  He termed it has one of the best systems of public transport in the world because of which more than 4 lakh vehicles are avoided on roads, thereby, reducing pollution.

 



 

The Minister also called upon other States to work unitedly in curbing pollution.  It was informed that Delhi alone gets 52MW energy from solid waste management and waste compost plant is operational. The closure of Badarpur Thermal Plant, banning of pet coke and conversion of 2789 Brick kilns in NCR to Zig-Zag technology has also led to reduction of pollution. 

 

Underlining the various actions undertaken by the Government to control road and construction and demolition (C&D) dust, the Minister said emulating the best dust management practices from Delhi Metro has led to pollution reduction and presently there is nearly 5 lakh MT waste which is being processed as Recycled Aggregate/Brick base.

                The Government of India, Government of Odisha and the World Bank today signed a US$165 million loan agreement to support smallholder farmers strengthen the resilience of their production systems as well as diversify and improve the marketing of their produce, for increased income.

The Odisha Integrated Irrigation Project for Climate Resilient Agriculture will be implemented in rural areas vulnerable to droughts and largely dependent on rainfed agriculture. It will benefit about 125,000 smallholder farmer households from 15 districts of Odisha managing 128,000 ha of agricultural land. The project will strengthen the resilience of smallholder farmers against adverse climate by improving access to resilient seed varieties and production technologies, diversifying towards more climate-resilient crops, and improving access to better water management and irrigation services.

The Government of India is implementing several missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change, which also extensively leverages adaptation of climate-smart agricultural practices and technologies,” said Shri Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. ""The project in Odisha is among several such initiatives supported by the government in our commitment to achieve the sustainable agriculture-related targets of the SDGs by 2030."" he added.

The loan agreement was signed by Shri Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, on behalf of the Government of India; Shri Surendra Kumar, Principal Secretary, Water Resources Department on behalf of the Government of Odisha; and Mr Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, India on behalf of the World Bank.

In recent years, climate variability has seriously affected agriculture in Odisha, where farming is largely dominated by farmers with landholdings of less than two hectares. More and more agricultural areas are coming under the ambit of extreme weather events. Since 2009, the frequency of droughts in the state has increased from 1 in 5 years to 1 in 2 years. Today, about 70 percent of total cultivated area is prone to droughts compared to 40 percent in the 1970s. In fact, since 2013, floods are now devastating areas beyond the traditional flood zone. Drier areas are projected to become drier, while wetter areas will become wetter. Agriculture is also a major source of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in Odisha, responsible for about 25 percent of the GHG emissions in the state.

“Across Odisha small-scale farmers are bearing the brunt of climate change. Erratic and extreme weather are responsible for declining yields and falling incomes. At the same time, agriculture is a large contributor to GHG emissions,” said Mr Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India. “The project is intended to be a game-changer for the State; creating a more resilient agricultural sector, enhancing food security, increasing farmers’ incomes and reducing the GHG footprint of the sector,” he added.

 

The project will support the rehabilitation of 532 water tanks - expected to irrigate 91,435 ha; promote productivity improvements at the farm level; support farmers to reduce the current emphasis on food grains (especially paddy and wheat) and increase the share of high-value and more nutritious products like fruits and vegetables; and provide marketing support to farmers who are able to generate a marketable surplus. 

The project will also support aquaculture in rehabilitated tanks, help farmers access affordable and quality fingerlings, and disseminate improved aquaculture practices and post-harvest management.

“Rehabilitating existing tanks will make agriculture more productive and climate-resilient for smallholder farmers,” said Mr Ranjan Samantaray, Senior Agriculture Specialist and World Bank’s Task Team Leader for the project. “This project will support the Government of Odisha’s vision to build the resilience of the agriculture sector to climate change, expand cultivable area under assured irrigation and improve water use efficiency,” he added.


The $165 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 6-year grace period, and a maturity of 24 years.

                The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), Gurugram Zonal Unit, Gurugram arrested Sh. Rajiv Gupta on 23.10.2019, partner in M/s RST Batteries, Mundka Delhi and Director of M/s RST Batteries Pvt. Ltd Bahadurgarh, Haryana for orchestrating a racket involving fake invoices valued at more than Rs 136 crores thereby defrauding the Government of more than Rs 20 crores. This fraud was given effect to by issuing fake invoices by creating a web of more than 52 fake firms. These fake firms were used to issue bogus invoices which were passed on to various dealers and manufacturers who used them for discharging Government duty, in essence defrauding the Government of huge amounts of revenue.

Sh. Rajiv Gupta was absconding from the authorities since 12.07.2019. After several attempts the sleuths of DGGI traced him to a location in Delhi where he was apprehended. Given the quantum of evasion this offence is categorised as cognizable and non-bailable under GST law. 

Sh. Rajiv Gupta was produced before the Hon’ble Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurugram, who remanded him to 14 days of judicial custody.

The Gurugam Zonal Unit of DGGI has so far arrested 10 persons in similar cases thereby unearthing fake invoices more than Rs 1,500 crores, which has defrauded the sovereign exchequer of more than Rs 280 crores. 

Investigation in the above matter is underway and the figures are likely to go up.

                Union Finance Minister, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, has said that the global economic risks and imbalances reinforce the need to strengthen global co-operation at the multilateral level, besides governmental initiatives. She stated this in her intervention during International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) Plenary Session yesterday in the ongoing Annual Meetings 2019 of the IMF and World Bank being held in Washington DC, USA. At the National level, a calibrated and balanced approach to deploying a mix of fiscal, monetary and structural measures by countries can help achieve their growth potential, the Finance Minister added.

Smt. Sitharaman further stated that International Monetary Fund (IMF) should provide solutions that are specific to important growth geographies to help alleviate the current conundrum. The Finance Minister also stated that the IMF should evolve a policy framework that would assess the vulnerability of economies to capital flows and that developing stronger surveillance mechanism with sharper diagnostic tools can mitigate or even prevent the adverse effects on fragile economies. On the 15th Round of the IMF’s General Review of the Quotas (15th GRQ) likely to conclude without a quota increase, the Finance Minister stated that work on the 16th Round should begin in right earnest and should have a tight timeframe.

The Finance Minister also attended International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) Restricted Breakfast .

Smt. Sitharaman later participated in the 100th Meeting of the Development Committee Plenary. The items on the agenda included the World Development Report 2020: Trading for Development in Age of Global value Chains; Jobs and Economic Transformation (JET): Drivers, Policy Implications and WBG Support theme for IDA; Human Capital Project: An update; and IDA Voting Rights Review: Report to Governors. In her intervention at this session, the Finance Minister mentioned that as we draw closer to SDG 2030, India is pursuing both scale and speed of development, through large National missions in a fiscally responsible, sustainable and inclusive manner. These programs range widely from solar energy to direct benefit transfer, from skilling to sanitation. But there is a common approach: to improve incomes, reduce deprivation and enhance living standards. Smt. Sitharaman also stated that in pursuing investment led growth, we should not neglect sustainability, efficiency and transparency in debt and tax policies. Moreover, investments must generate domestic revenues that can be channelized into effective public spending in health, education and skilling so that youth can benefit from the economic growth. The Finance Minister encouraged IMF to guide concerted international action to combat illegal financial flows and welcomed collaboration to push investment to augment MDB financing into developing countries.

She concluded her engagements with a press conference where she talked about the highlights of this visit. 

The Finance Minister is currently on an official tour to Washington DC to attend the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and other associated meetings. She is accompanied by Mr. Shaktikanta Das, Governor, RBI; Secretary Economic Affairs, Shri Atanu Chakraborty; and other officials.

She also attended the Working Lunch Session of the Development Committee (DC), the ministerial-level committee of the IMF and the World Bank. In the DC Lunch, the members discussed about the global economic outlook. In her intervention, the Finance Minister mentioned that trade wars and protectionism have generated uncertainties that will ultimately impact flow of capital, goods and services. She called for ‘concerted action’ to mitigate the disruption on account of synchronous slowdown and to invoke the spirit of multilateralism for global growth. She further said that the increased trade integration, geopolitical uncertainties, and high accumulated debt levels necessitate strong global coordination and that we need not wait for the slowdown to become a crisis.

 

The 40th meetings of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) of the IMF are being held at this year’s Annual Meetings. During the day, three sessions of the IMFC took place. The IMFC Introductory Session was focused on Global Developments and Prospects and the discussions centred on the World Economic Outlook released on October 15, 2019. The Early Warning Exercise discussed upcoming risks to global economy and stability. A special session on IMF resources and governance was also held early in the day, in the context of the 15th Round of the quota discussions concluding this year.

The Ministers and Governors also took updates from the G20 Deputies on Quality Infrastructure Investment, Debt Sustainability, Financing for Universal Health Care and Building Effective Country Platforms, and from the Africa Advisory Group on the Compact with Africa (CwA) initiative. On the discussions at the session regarding the work underway on developing a consensus solution on tax challenges arising from digitalization, the Finance Minister stated that a unified approach to the nexus and profit allocation challenges is a promising one that merits serious attention. A solution that is simple to implement, simple to administer and simple to comply with is needed.

                On 16.10.2019, the Income Tax Department conducted search action under the Income-tax Act, 1961 in the case of a conglomerate of trusts and companies that run year-round “wellness courses” and training programmes in philosophy, spirituality, etc at various sprawling residential campuses in Varadaiahpalem in Andhra Pradesh (AP), and also in Chennai and Bengaluru.

The group which was founded by a spiritual guru in the 1980s with “oneness” philosophy has also diversified into several sectors including real estate, construction, sports, etc in India and abroad. The group is presently managed and controlled by the spiritual leader who laid the foundation of the group, and his son. The courses attract residential customers from abroad and the group earns substantial receipts in foreign exchange. There was intelligence that the group has been suppressing its receipts which are ploughed into investment in huge tracts of landed property in AP and Tamil Nadu (TN) and also in investments abroad. The search action which is still in progress has covered about 40 premises located in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Varadaiahpalem. 

During the search proceedings, evidence has been found that the group has been regularly suppressing its receipts at its various centres or ashrams. Evidence has been found with key employees who maintained record of cash collections that were kept outside the accounts for use in making investments elsewhere and also for paying for properties over and above documented values. It is learnt that the group also earned unaccounted income in receiving cash from property sales over and above documented values. A preliminary estimate of such unaccounted cash receipts is Rs 409 crore from FY 2014-15 onwards. Such unaccounted cash receipts are also evidenced by huge quantities of cash and other valuables found at the residences of the founder and his son, and at one of the campuses. A total sum of cash of Rs 43.9 crore has been found and seized by the Department at these premises. 

Apart from the above, substantial sums of foreign currencies have also been found and seized. The total of such foreign exchange found at these premises is about $2.5 million which amounts to approximately Rs 18 crore. Foreign exchange in other currencies has also been found and seized. Substantial quantities of undisclosed gold in the form of jewellery, about 88 kg approximately valued at over Rs 26 crore, has also been found and seized. Undisclosed diamonds amounting to 1,271 carats valued approximately at about Rs 5 crore were also found and seized. Total value of seizure so far is approximately Rs 93 crore. The undisclosed income of the group detected so far is estimated at more than Rs 500 crore. The search proceedings are still in progress. 

An important finding of the search is that the group has been investing in a number of companies in India and abroad, including in tax havens. Some of these companies based in China, USA, Singapore, UAE, etc are found to be receiving payments from foreign clients who attend the various residential “wellness” courses offered in India. The Department is investigating into diversion of income taxable in India to offshore entities by the group in this process. Further, it is found that one of the group trusts may be providing accommodation entries for other parties by receiving donations from them and then returning the money back under the garb of expenses and receiving a small percentage as fee. Instances have also been found where the group is not accounting for money received from foreign clients in cash in foreign currency and then exchanging the same in the grey market. All these leads are being pursued and investigation is in progress.

                Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs , Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, led the Indian delegation at G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors as well as the BRICS Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meetings held in Washington D.C yesterday. Finance Minister is leading the Indian delegation to the IMF/WB Annual Meetings being held in Washington D.C this week. 

The focus of discussions in the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting was on the current challenges to the global economy and possible responses to mitigate them. Smt Sitharaman emphasized that the G20 has the responsibility to navigate the global policy co-ordination in effective fashion by identifying and taking strong measures for building buffers and catalysing a second wave of reforms. She gave a clarion call for concerted action in the face of global slowdown. She also highlighted that the emerging market economies, in particular, face the challenge of achieving economic growth and inclusive development while pursuing sustainable financing. In this context, Finance Minister emphasized on the  importance of countries pursuing structural reform measures to counter the growth slowdown.  The structural reform measures undertaken by India was highlighted by the Finance Minister particularly, the recent measures such as reduction of Corporate tax. Smt. Sitharaman indicated that India has reduced the Corporate tax from 30% to 22% thereby making India one of the lowest corporate tax imposing countries in the world today. This will spur investment. Alongside the Corporate tax reform, Government of India’s measures pertaining to Aaadhar based Direct Benefit Transfer as well as Universal Health Care policy received special mention from the Finance Minister. In conclusion, FM re-emphasized the need for G20 to ensure collective action so as to enable global growth to regain pace. 

The main issues discussed during the BRICS FMCBG meeting included those pertaining to New Development Bank (such as membership expansion and enhancing the effectiveness of the utilization of the NDB’s Project Preparation Facility); developing the way forward on IMF resources as well as formulating a consensus co-operation on Authorized Economic Operators Programme. 

On NDB issues, the Finance Minister in her interventions, emphasized India’s strong support for NDB’s membership expansion and encouraged NDB Management to continue the good progress achieved on this issue till date. As far as improving the effectiveness of the Project Preparation Facility is concerned, the Finance Minister indicated that sustainable recovery mechanisms need to be inbuilt into the PPF guidelines so that the assistance extended is recovered once the project loan is sanctioned. Regarding the IMF resources issue, Smt. Sitharaman indicated India’s deep regret on the lack of progress of the 15th General Review of Quotas (15th GRQ). With reference to the alternative proposal emerging at the current juncture with reference to strengthening borrowed resources of IMF, Finance Minister expressed a word of caution and indicated that borrowed resources cannot provide full confidence in extreme crisis situations as creditor nations themselves may be in stress. 

 

Prior to the G20 FMCBG, the G20 Finance and Central Bank Deputies also met to discuss the way forward on priority G20 agenda items such as Quality Infrastructure Investment, building effective country platforms, attaining debt sustainability as well as strengthening universal health care financing.  Secretary, Economic Affairs Shri Atanu Chakraborty as India’s G20 Finance Deputy led the Ministry of Finance delegation for this meeting. 

On Quality Infrastructure Investment, Shri Chakraborty urged the G20 to explore innovative sources of financing for boosting infrastructure development ensuring that quality considerations are in-built into these financing sources. As far as debt sustainability is concerned, Secretary , Economic Affairs while agreeing the importance of the agenda, struck a word of caution that the agenda of debt sustainability and transparency in LICs should not undermine the internationally agreed commitment on official development assistance. He also expressed India’s keen interest in the work IMF is pursuing on collateralized debt and looked forward to the research from IMF on the area. On strengthening UHC financing, he emphasised that the discussions on UHC financing must adopt a holistic approach encompassing preventive, curative and palliative care as well as plurality of pathways for achieving UHC including through traditional and complementary systems of medicine. On building effective country platforms, Shri Chakraborty emphasized that the G20 should reflect further about who will build the platform, how the private sector will be engaged in the process and the contours and scope of the platform as to whether it will involve project preparation, knowledge sharing, technical assistance etc.

In other engagements, Union Finance Minister attended an Industry Roundtable organized by USIBC and CII as well as an Economist Roundtable organized by CII. She also held bilateral meetings with Chancellor of Exchequer United Kingdom, Mr. Sajid Javed; Secretary of State for Development of the United Kingdom, Rt. Hon. Alok Sharma; Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of South Korea, Mr. Hong Nam Ki; President of the World Bank, Mr. David Malpass; Special Advisor to Japanese Finance Minister and Candidate for ADB, Mr. Masatsugu Asakawa; Governor of JBIC, Mr. Tadashi Maeda; and Global CEO of Standard Chartered, Mr. Bill Winters.

                Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has launched a revamped and streamlined programme to attract investments into India and strengthen Make in India through manufacture and other operations under bond scheme, under Customs Act, 1962. Section 65 of the Customs Act, 1962 enables conduct of manufacture and other operations in a customs bonded warehouse.  

            The scheme has been modernized with clear and transparent procedures, simplified compliance requirements ICT-based documentation and account keeping, by issue of Manufacture and Other Operations in Warehouse (no. 2) Regulations, 2019 and Circular 34/2019 both dated 01 October 2019. The main features of the scheme are as below - 


	A single application cum approval form prescribed for uniformity of practice. The jurisdictional Commissioner of Customs will function as a single point of approval to set up and oversee the operations of such units.
	No geographical limitation on where such units can be set up. 
	The unit can import goods (both inputs and capital goods) under a customs duty deferment program. The duties are fully remitted if the processed goods are exported. 
	There will be no interest liability and units will benefit through improved liquidity. 
	GST compliant goods can be procured from the domestic market for use in manufacture and other operations in a section 65 unit. 
	A single digital account has been prescribed for ease of doing business and easy compliance.
	 The scheme would also enable efficient capacity utilization, as there is no limit on quantum of clearances that can be exported or cleared to the domestic market.


            CBIC has collaborated with Invest India to launch a dedicated microsite for providing information and promoting the scheme and for facilitation of investors. The site can be accessed at https://www.investindia.gov.in/bonded-manufacturing

            The scheme is expected to play a critical role in promoting investments in India and in enhancing ease of doing business. It can enable the ‘Make in India’ programme, encourage exports, create hubs for electronics assembly, repair & refurbishment operations, inward and outward processing, facilitate global e-commerce hubs etc.

                Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman reviewed the performance of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) here today in a meeting with bank chief executives. Credit and implementation of measures announced to support economic growth were reviewed in-depth.



In the review, it was noted that during the first phase of the Customer Outreach Initiative, from 1st to 9th October 2019, PSBs disbursed Rs 81,781 crore, including new term loans of Rs 34,342 crore. Banks shared their plans for the second phase of the Customer Outreach Initiative, with camps in about 150 districts between 21st to 25th October 2019, building on the momentum already built. 



As in the first phase, NBFCs would also participate. Further, receivable bill discounting for MSMEs would also be a focus area.  Details of specific dues outstanding of the companies, including MSME, with the corporates and aggregating approximately Rs 40,000 crores will be shared by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs with banks for reaching out to MSMEs during the Customer Outreach Initiative for bill discounting and enabling MSMEs to access working capital. 



In addition, home loans, vehicle loans, agriculture loans, education loans, and other MSME and personal loans would be focused upon. It was reiterated that the outreach would be without any dilution in diligence or underwriting standards. It was also noted that with the recent recapitalisation of over Rs 55,000 crore, PSBs are well equipped to support credit needs.

It was noted in the review that PSBs have continued to support the NBFC/HFC sector. Since the IL&FS default in September 2018 till 10th October 2019, PSBs have sanctioned total support of Rs 3,97,557 crore in the form of credit as well as pool-buyouts of Rs 1,07,792 crore, including Rs 15,455 crore under the newly launched Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme. Disbursement by PSBs to NBFCs has been Rs 39,068 crore since the last review on 19th September 2019 till 10th October 2019. 

The PSB’s chief executives informed that they will continue expeditious disbursement of pool buy-outs including those sanctioned under the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme. Government would also issue suitable clarifications to banks with a view to expedite processing of proposals under the scheme.

                The Asian Development Bank and the Government of India yesterday signed a $190 million loan to upgrade 754 kilometres of state highways and major district roads (MDRs) to two-lane or intermediate-lane standards that will benefit about 26 million people in 14 districts of Rajasthan.

The signatories to the Tranche 2 loan agreement for the Rajasthan State Highway Investment Programme were Shri Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional  Secretary (Fund Bank and ADB), Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India, and Mr Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission, who signed for ADB. The Tranche 1 loan of $220 million under the Programme, signed in July 2017, upgraded about 1,000 km of state roads.

Shri Khare said after signing the loan agreement that the Tranche 2 roads pass through mostly rural areas of Rajasthan that lack reliable connectivity and will help improve access to health, education facilities and markets leading to increased job opportunities.

Mr Yokoyama emphasised to promote operational efficiencies and innovations and said that the project will encourage participation of private sector through Hybrid Annuity Mode and engineering procurement construction (EPC) contracts.

The ADB value-addition will consist in financing part of the construction costs for the annuity-based public private partnership (PPP) concessions and EPC contracts and ensure good governance during project implementation, particularly on procurement and safeguards. The annuity-based PPP model attracts private sector financing to address capital investment requirements, where a proportion of initial capital expenditure is paid during construction while the balance is serviced by annuity payments during the operation and maintenance phase. The toll collection rights will remain with the state public works department to bring sustainability in operation and maintenance of the project.

For the benefit of commuters and pedestrians, particularly women and children, the project provides for constructing more than 200 bus stops, 70 km of hard shoulder, and 2 km of raised sidewalk on project roads.

ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. In 2018, it made commitments of new loans and grants amounting to $21.5 billion. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members—49 from the region.

                The Income Tax Department, conducted a search action on 11th October, 2019 in the case of a business group based in Namakkal, Tamil Nadu. The group is mainly into running of educational institutions, and coaching institutes for competitive exams like NEET, etc. The group comprises several partnership firms and a trust controlled by a closely knit group of individuals. The search action covered 17 premises including residential premises of the group's promoters. The premises are located in Namakkal, Perundurai, Karur and Chennai in Tamil Nadu.

The search was undertaken on the basis of intelligence that the group was indulging in substantial tax evasion by suppression of fee receipts received from students. The modus operandi was to receive part of the fees in cash and such cash receipts were invariably not entered in the regular books of accounts. Instead, such receipts were maintained in separate set of accounts. Incriminating evidence of such suppression of receipts has been found during the search in the form of accounts maintained in diaries, in electronic storage devices and also in the form of huge sums of unaccounted cash. It was found that cash was kept in lockers in banks in the names of employees who acted as benami or name lenders.

Significant amount of cash was found in a safe inside an auditorium in the main school premises. Unaccounted cash of about Rs 30 crore has been found and seized. The unaccounted receipts are deployed for acquiring immovable properties as personal investments which are then leased for long term to the trust for expanding to other towns. It was also found that highly priced faculty are hired and employed in the coaching institutes and they are paid outside the books. Based on preliminary findings, the undisclosed income of the group is estimated at more than Rs 150 crore. The search is still in progress.

                The Income Tax Department conducted search on 9th October 2019 on a prominent business group in Karnataka which runs multiple educational institutions. During the course of the search, the modus operandi of conversion of seats which were originally to be allotted by merit through counselling by MCC maliciously into institutional quota seats through dropout system has been unearthed.

Incriminating evidence has been found in the search, substantiating conversion of seats, commission payments to brokers and sale of seats in exchange of receipt of cash. Evidences of use of multiple agents for conversion of MBBS and PG seats have also been found. Diversion of funds in the form of payment of on-money for the purpose of purchase of immovable assets for the benefit of trustees has also been established including finding of cash in possession of seller, commission in the hands of broker and strong written and audio evidences found in possession of the concerned parties. Evidences of handling of such cash generated, diversion for construction of hotels have also been found. Hawala transactions relating to movement of such cash have also been established. A total of Rs.4.22 crore of unaccounted cash has so far been found including Rs.89 lakh in the house of the main trustee.

Certain students whose names were used in conversion of seats have made statements establishing the modus operandi. Agents have admitted to have aided in sale of seats, brokers have admitted to be witness and accomplice to diversion of such cash generated.

Modus operandi of making cash deposits in the accounts of certain employees & their families and diversion of them to fixed deposits which are used to services loans taken by trustees has been unearthed. Evidence has further brought to light the fact that trustees have opened bank accounts in the names of their employees to deposit some of the capitation fee received in cash. Fixed deposits amounting to Rs. 4.6 crore in the names of 8 employees made in the above manner have been seized. It was further found that the interest from such benami fixed deposits have been used to service the loans taken by the trustees in their personal capacity.

Evidences also reveal undisclosed investments in real estate. Overall the total undisclosed income detected so far is around Rs.100 crore considering the cash donations received for 185 seats averaging Rs.50 lakh to Rs.65 lakh per seat and total seizure of undisclosed assets of Rs. 8.82 crore. Further investigations are in progress.

                The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), Gurugram Zonal Unit (GZU), Haryana has arrested two persons namely Sh. Gulshan Dhingra resident of Ramesh Nagar, New Delhi and Sh. Sanjay Dhingra resident of Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi who were found involved in fake invoices racket having taxable value of Rs. 931 crore and fraudulently passing/ availing Input Tax Credit (ITC) amounting to Rs. 127 crore through a complex web chain of various entities. Many of these entities were under their control and they also formed separate entities in the name of their employees/ dummy persons and generated fake invoices without actual movement of goods, namely ferrous/ non-ferrous scrap, ingots, nickel cathode etc., thereby causing loss to exchequer by evasion of GST. They availed this fraudulent ITC to offset their GST liability and also passed on such fraudulent ITC to further buyers who availed the same to discharge their GST liability against their outward supplies with an ulterior motive to defraud the Government exchequer. During the course of investigation, their employees/ dummy persons admitted of having no knowledge of movement of above mentioned goods.     

                                                                                             

Thus, Sh. Gulshan Dhingra and Sh. Sanjay Dhingra have committed offences under the provisions of Section 132(1)(b) & (c) of the Central Goods & Services Tax Act (CGST), 2017, which are cognizable and non-bailable offences and punishable under Section 132 of the CGST Act, 2017. Consequently, Sh. Gulshan Dhingra and Sh. Sanjay Dhingra were arrested on 07th October, 2019 under Section 69(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 and produced before Judicial Magistrate in Gurugram Court on 07th October, 2019. Court has sent them to judicial custody till 19th October, 2019. Further investigation in the matter is in progress.

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today approved to release an additional instalment of Dearness Allowance (DA) to Central Government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) to pensioners w.e.f. 01.07.2019 representing an increase of 5% over the existing rate of 12% of the Basic pay/Pension, to compensate for price rise.  This increase is in accordance with the accepted formula, which is based on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission.  

The combined impact on the exchequer on account of both Dearness Allowance and Dearness Relief would be Rs. 15909.35 crore per annum and Rs. 10606.20 crore in the financial year 2019-20 (for a period of 08 months from July, 2019 to February, 2020).  This will benefit about 49.93 lakh Central Government employees and 65.26 lakh pensioners. 

The additional financial implication on account of this increase in Dearness Allowance is estimated at Rs 8590.20 Crore per year; and Rs 5726.80 Crore in the current Financial Year of 2019-20 (for 8 months from July 2019 to February 2020).

The additional financial implication on account of the Dearness Relief to pensioners is estimated to be Rs 7319.15 Crore per annum and Rs 4870 Crore in the current FY.

Dear Allowance/Dearness Relief is paid to Central Government employees/pensioners to adjust the cost of living and to protect their basic pay/pension from erosion in the real value. Dear Allowance/Dearness Relief is revised twice a year from 1st January and 1st July.

Revenue Secretary Shri Ajay Bhushan Pandey inaugurated National e-Assessment Scheme (NeAC) here today in the presence of CBDT Chairman Shri P.C. Mody and Members Shri P.K. Das, Shri Akhilesh Ranjan and Shri Prabhash Shankar.

While inaugurating the NeAC, Shri Pandey said that it is matter of great pride and achievement for the Income Tax Department to bring NeAC to life in a small span of time. Retracing the origins of NeAC in 2017, Shri Pandey lauded the IT Department for striving to achieve transparency with speed.

Shri Pandey said that with the launch of National e-Assessment Centre (NeAC), the Income Tax Department will usher in a paradigm shift in its working by introducing faceless e-assessment to impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability in the assessment process. He said that with NeAC, there would be no physical interface between the tax payers and the tax officers. 

The setting up of NeAC of the Income Tax Department is a momentous step towards the larger objectives of better taxpayer service, reduction of taxpayer grievances in line with Prime Minister’s vision of ‘Digital India’ and promotion of Ease of Doing Business.

In the first phase, the Income Tax Department has selected 58,322 cases for scrutiny under the faceless e-Assessment Scheme 2019 and the e-notices have been served before 30th of September 2019 for the cases of Assessment Year 2018-19. 

The taxpayers have been advised to check their registered e-filing accounts/ email ids and have been requested to furnish reply within 15 days. The Department hopes that with the ease of compliance for taxpayers, the cases would be disposed off expeditiously.

Benefits of Faceless Assessment:


	NeAC eliminates human interface between Assessing Officer and Assessee
	New System optimises the utilisation of resources through economies of scale
	NeAC introduces team based assessment with dynamic jurisdiction
	Ease of compliance for taxpayers
	Brings transparency and efficiency, thus improves quality of assessment and monitoring
	Functional specialisation as only one agency dealing with faceless assessment
	Expeditious disposal of cases
	Standardisation and quality management


 

About National e-Assessment Centre (NeAC) :

NeAC will be an independent office that will look after the work of e-Assessment scheme which is recently notified for faceless e-assessment for income tax payers. There would be a NeAC in Delhi to be headed by Principal Chief Commissioner of Income Tax (Pr.CCIT). There are 8 Regional e-Assessment Centres (ReAC) set up at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata Ahmedabad, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad which would comprise Assessment unit, Review unit, Technical unit and Verification units. Each ReAC will be headed by Chief Commissioner of Income Tax (CCIT). Cases for the specified work shall be assigned by the NeAC to different units by way of automated allocation systems. In view of the dynamic and all India jurisdiction of all officers of NeAC and ReAC, this kind of connective and collaborative effort of officers is likely to lead to better quality of assessments.

About Faceless e-Assessment:

 

Centre Government had recently notified e-Assessment scheme to facilitate faceless assessment of income tax returns through completely electronic communication between tax officials and tax payers. 

Under the new system of faceless e-Assessment, tax payers will receive notices on their registered emails as well as on registered accounts on the web portal www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in with real time alert by way of SMS on their registered mobile number, specifying the issues for which their cases have been selected for scrutiny. The replies to the notices can be prepared at ease by the tax payers at their own residence or office and be sent by email to the National e-Assessment Centre by uploading the same on the designated web portal.

This new initiative of faceless assessment is expected to increase ease of compliance for taxpayers as the cost and anxiety of taxpayers are likely to be greatly reduced. No human interface with the Department would be a game changer. This is another initiative by CBDT in the field of ease of compliance for our tax payers.

                The Income Tax Department is ushering in a paradigm shift in its working by introducing faceless e-assessment to impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability in the assessment process. There would be no physical interface between the tax payers and the tax officers. 

The setting up of National e-Assessment Centre (NeAC) of the Income Tax Department is a momentous step towards the larger objectives of better taxpayer service, reduction of taxpayer grievances in line with Prime Minister’s vision of ‘Digital India’ and promotion of ease of doing business.

Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman will inaugurate  National e-Assessment Centre ( NeAC)  in New Delhi tomorrow in the presence of  Shri Anurag Singh Thakur, Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs . Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, Revenue Secretary, Shri Pramod Chandra Mody, Chairman, CBDT will also be present .  Officers of the Income Tax Department and other dignitaries shall also be linked through Multimedia Video Conferencing at Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru.

Under the new system, tax payers have received notices on their registered emails as well as on registered accounts on the web portal www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in with real time alert by way of SMS on their registered mobile number, specifying the issues for which their cases have been selected for scrutiny. The replies to the notices can be prepared at ease by the tax payers at their own residence or office and be sent by email to the National e-Assessment Centre by uploading the same on the designated web portal.

This is another initiative by CBDT in the field of ease of compliance for our tax payers.

                Government has noted the reduction in repo rate from 5.40 percent to 5.15 percent announced by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and believes that this will complement the recent measures taken by government to accelerate growth. 

Government has also taken note of the revised growth projections of the MPC at 6.1 percent for 2019-20 along with growth projections made by other bodies including the IMF, ADB etc. 

Government has further taken note of higher projection of headline inflation by MPC for 2019-20, which is within the band of 3-4 percent and well within the target range.

                The Documentation Identification Number (DIN) system of Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has come into existence from todaywiththe generation of about 17,500 communications with DIN on the very first day. This path breaking DIN system has been created as per the direction of Finance Minister Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman and from now onwards every CBDT communication will have to have a documentation identification number.

Revenue Secretary Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey said, “From today, any communication from Income Tax Department without a computer generated DIN, be it a notice, letter, order and summon or any other correspondence,would be treated as invalid and shall be non est in law or deemed to be as if it has never been issued. The DIN system would ensure greater accountability and transparency in tax administration.”

“Now from today onwards, all such communications with DIN would be verifiable on the e-filing portal and no communication would be issued manually without DIN except only if it is in the specified exceptional circumstances”, said Dr. Pandey.

It would be pertinent to mention here that while specifying such exceptional circumstances the CBDT Circular related to DIN dated 14.08.2019 says thatwhenever any such manual communication would be issued, it would be necessarily required to specify reason of issuing such a communication without DIN along with the date of obtaining written approval of the Chief Commissioner/Director General of Income Tax in a particular format. Any communication which is not in conformity of with the prescribed guidelines shall be treated as invalid and non est in law.

CBDT has specified that any communication issued manually under exceptional circumstances would have to be uploaded and regularised on the system portal within 15 days of its issuance.

CBDT has also stated that all pending assessment proceedings, where notices were earlier issued manually, prior to the DIN related Circular dated 14.08.2019 coming into existence, all such cases would be identified and notices so sent would be uploaded on ITBA by the end of this month, i.e., by 31st Oct 2019.

This is in pursuance of the directions by the Hon’ble Prime Minister in which he has asked the Department of Revenue to come up with specific measures to ensure that the honest taxpayers are not harassed and served better. It may be noted that earlier there have been some instances where it was not possible to maintain the audit trail of the manually issued communication which in some cases caused inconvenience to taxpayers sometime. However, with the present system of attaching a DIN to every notice or communication of CBDT would result in better services to taxpayers without any possible harassment.

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has signed the 300th Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) during the month of September, 2019. This is a significant landmark of India’s APA Programme, which is currently in its seventh year.

 

Three APAs were entered into in September, 2019 (2 Unilateral and 1 Bilateral APA), which has taken the total number of APAs signed by CBDT to 300. During the ongoing fiscal, the total number of APAs entered into has gone up to 29 (27 Unilateral and 2 Bilateral APAs). The Bilateral APA signed in September, 2019 pertains to United Kingdom.

 

The APAs entered into during September, 2019 pertain to various sectors of the economy like retail, garments, and consumer foods. The international transactions covered in these agreements, inter alia, include provision of software development services, contract manufacturing, provision of IT enabled Services and provision of Support Services.

 

The APA Scheme continues to make good progress in providing tax certainty to MNEs. It reflects the Government’s commitment towards fostering a non-adversarial tax regime.

(N.B: For Delhi, 19th livestock census figures are used)

The Livestock Census has been conducted in the country periodically since 1919-20. The Livestock Census covers all domesticated animals and its headcounts. So far 19 such censuses have been conducted in participation with State Governments and UT Administrations. The 20th Livestock Census was conducted in participation with all States and Union Territories. The enumeration was done both in rural and urban areas. Various species of animals (Cattle, Buffalo, Mithun, Yak, Sheep, Goat, Pig, Horse, Pony, Mule, Donkey Camel, Dog, Rabbit and Elephant)/poultry birds (Fowl, Duck, Emu, Turkeys, Quail and other poultry birds) possessed by the households, household enterprises/non-household enterprises and institutions have been counted at their site. 

The major thrust given to 20th Livestock Census is the collection of data through tablets computers. The 20th livestock census is indeed a unique attempt as for the first time such a major initiative has been take to digitise household level data through online transmission from the field.  National Informatics Centre (NIC) has developed a mobile Application software and was used for data collection as well as online transmission of data from the field to the NIC server. Since India is a vast country endowed with huge wealth of livestock, it is really a challenge to collect data in an online platform especially with breed-wise and age–structure composition. Crossing these challenges, data of more than 27 Crores of households and non-households have been collected in the 20th Livestock Census to assess and arrive at the livestock and poultry count in the country. 

In this whole Census operations, The State/UT Governments engaged more than 80000 field personnel who are mostly veterinarians and para-veterinarians for the smooth conduct of 20th Livestock Census. Training was an important component of the Census as for the first time the field staff were required to operate tablet computers for such massive Census Operation. Training was conducted at various levels starting from “All India Training Workshop for Trainers” at Delhi, followed by State, District level training.  Apart   from training, Training Manual, Tutorial video, online e-learning classes etc. have been arranged.

Two diagnostic kits developed by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) - Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) under the ‘Make in India’ initiative, namely the Bluetongue sandwich ELISA (sELISA) and the Japanese Encephalitis lgM ELISA kit for the control of Swine and Detection of Antigen, were released by Shri Atul Chaturvedi, Secretary Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying and Dr. T. Mahopatra, Secretary DARE and DG, ICAR at Krishi Bhawan today. This indigenous technology will not just help save foreign exchange as the newly developed kits cost ten times lesser than the imported ones but also has the potential to earn foreign exchange.          

Addressing the gathering, Dr. Trilochan Mohapatra briefed about the main characteristics of the two Kits. Talking about the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) ELISA Kit (IgM) for Swine, Dr. Mohapatra mentioned that the JE is a re-emerging viral zoonotic disease leading to death of children every year in the country. The kit developed by the ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute is really helpful for assessing the active infection of JE virus in the swine population which predicts the outbreak of JE in the humans. As compared to the commercial kit available in the market at a price of Rs. 52,000; the ICAR-IVRI developed is available for the farmers at a minimal price of Rs. 5,000 only. The Director General mentioned that each kit is meant for testing around 45 samples.

Highlighting the key features of another Kit “Bluetongue: Sandwich ELISA for detection of Antigen”, Dr. Mohapatra stated that the Bluetongue (BT) virus is an insect-transmitted viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants that includes the camelid species. The disease is widespread among the sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes and camels in the country. With the help of the Kit, the Bluetongue Virus can be controlled with the vaccination of susceptible animals, vector control and quarantine of infected animals with the good management practices. Apart from the vaccination, the early diagnosis and isolation of the infected animals are one of the commonly suggested preventive methods for controlling the spreading of the disease.

Shri Atul Chaturvedi applauded the joint initiative by the ICAR and the Department of Animal Husbandry as an incredible initiative. Shri Chaturvedi stated that release of these two Kits will definitely be beneficial for not only the farming community, but the society as a whole. Citing about the number of casualties caused by the deadliest diseases in the societies every year, the Secretary mentioned that the Kits will prove to be a real helping hand. 

Shri Sushil Kumar, Additional Secretary (DARE) & Secretary (ICAR) applauded the ICAR & Department of Animal Husbandry’s initiative in the designated direction. Shri Kumar stated that the kits have been prepared with care. He accentuated that proper research works by the scientists of both the organizations were carried out before the official launching of the Kits. The Kits were also tested against the mentioned virus and diseases caused by the animals for their validity.       

Dr. R.K. Singh, Director, Indian Veterinary Research Institute emphasized on the measures to be adopted for controlling the spread of various harmful diseases by the birds, pigs and other animals. He stressed that humans are more prone to the transmittable diseases. He expressed his concerns about the various cases in which the children are more affected by the diseases as compared to the younger or older ones. He mentioned that the Kits will provide help in achieving our targets effectively and efficiently.

                “As we mark and celebrate 25 years of the Pulse Polio Programme, it is now time to aim at 100% Full Immunization Coverage and ensure that not even one child or pregnant woman dies of Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs)” said Dr.Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare, here today. Oct 2nd, 2019 marked 25 years of the first Pulse Polio campaign in Delhi, which was later adopted and implemented by Government of India as Pulse Polio Campaign across the country. The implementation of Polio Supplementary Immunization Activity played a key role in India’s attainment of polio-free status in 2014. This achievement was coined by the WHO as “one of the most significant achievements in public health,” and marked not just India but the entire South East Asia Region being declared polio-free.

Shri. J.P Nadda,former Health Ministerwas the Chief Guest of the event. He congratulated Dr. Harsh Vardhan, calling him the Chief Architect of the Polio Programme and commended the Health Ministry for the internationally successful and applauded Programme. Shri. Nadda said “As the health systems are robust and surveillance system of the country is very strong, I am very confident that Dr. Harsh Vardhan and his Ministry will achieve the full immunization coverage targets. The PHCs are being converted into Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs), which will ensure that in next 20 years the disease burden in the country is definitely going to decrease. I wish the Intensified Mission Indradhanush 2.0 all the very best”. Sh. Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare congratulated Dr. Harsh Vardhan calling him ‘Polio Senapati’ and his entire team and other stakeholders for their tremendous efforts to eliminate polio from the country. Sh Nadda encouraged all the health sector participants by telling them that their work and efforts do not show immediate results but it is these two drops and vaccinations that build a strong and healthy citizen in the long run, so they should continue working with same zeal and rigour to achieve Hon’ble Prime Minister’s dream of new and healthy India by 2022.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan talked about the new initiatives being taken bythe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to achieve the target of full immunization i.e. launch of Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) 2.0 from December 2019 to March 2020, wherein several ministries are coming forward to join hands in taking the mission forward.The IMI 2.0 portal, launched at the event, has been designed to capture information on the blockwise target of children and pregnant women to be vaccinated during the IMI drive and also the coverage data during the rounds of activity. The data will be entered at the district level. This will help the Programme officers and administrators at the block, district, state and national level to have real time information on the progress of the campaign and also take timely action on slow progress in any particular area. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan while reminiscing about the 25-year journey since the beginning of Pulse Polio Campaign,thanked all the partners and stakeholders of the Pulse Polio Programme. He said “I laud the efforts of community and religious leaders who joined hands as advocates of this mission. I cheer for the efforts of the nation’s youth ambassadors, celebrities and sportsmen who supported in building the campaign. I salute the stalwarts of our country, our ASHA workers, ANMs, Anganwadi workers (AWW) who ensured all doors were knocked. I commend the uncompromised commitment and zeal of our state governments, civil society organizations, professional bodies like IMA, IAP, partners such as WHO, Rotary International and UNICEF and most importantly the support of citizens of our country”.Union health Minister added that the level of commitment, accountability and ownership seen in this Programme was unprecedented and has not been witnessed elsewhere in the world. Dr Harsh Vardhan then said that while we are keeping our guards up for polio, Government has opted for a ‘game changing approach’ towards sustaining the gains of immunization, ensuring a healthy and prosperous future for our country. He added that learnings from polio campaign have further provided guidance for rollout of Mission Indradhanush and its intensified drive under the mentorship of our Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji. “Our visionary leader, Shri Narendra Modi ji has a dream of a healthy and robust India. It is our duty to contribute to this dream and ensure every child is vaccinated and grows up into a healthy citizen”.Dr. Harsh Vardhan concluded by calling upon all states, volunteers, partners, NGOs and other stakeholders to once again come forward and join hands to save every child from VPD, like they did for making India polio free”.

In 1988, the World Health Assembly (WHA) passed a resolution to launch the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). The Government of Delhi piloted the first ever large scale supplementary immunization campaign with Oral Polio Vaccine(OPV) in 1994 based on evidence of successful campaigns in other countries. This was when the “Pulse Polio” immunization campaign was born, followed by iconic ‘Do Boond Zindagi Ki’ tagline. On 2nd October 1994, Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary, the then Health Minister of Delhi, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, piloted the first Pulse Polio campaign in Delhi. The campaign in Delhi reached nearly 1.2 million children up to the age of three years with two doses of OPV being administered on 2nd October, 1994 and 4th December, 1994 through exclusive booth-based strategy. This strategy was later adopted and implemented by Government of India as Pulse Polio Campaigns. The polio eradication campaign brought together the government, international partners, civil society organizations, health workers, and millions of volunteers across the country. Through their dedication, India was able to overcome what had initially seemed like impossible hurdles and to stop the spread of this crippling disease. 

The event kick-started with a video ‘Beginning of the Polio Journey’ to mark the journey of Polio eradication in India, documenting the implementation of first campaign. This was followed by Panel Discussion with the Pulse Polio CampaignStalwarts (WHO, Rotary International, UNICEF) regarding strengthening immunization reach using learnings from Polio Campaign. This was followed by National Unity Day Pledge, to mark the occasion of Birth Anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Post the pledge, a session on sharing of experiences from the field pertaining to Pulse Polio Programme by Zonal Coordinator (Pulse Polio), and AWW was conducted. Thisconcluded with a film on ‘Journey of Polio and Mission Indradhanush’ to showcase the journey of ending Polio in India, summarizing major interventions, achievements and milestones, contribution of community leaders, Health workersand achievements of Mission Indradhanush. Besides the addressesby WHO-SEARO Regional Director, UNICEF Executive Director and ex-President of Rotary International, the event also saw launch of two guidelines i.e. Operational guidelines for ‘Strengthening immunization systems to reach every child’ and ‘Operational guidelines for Strengthening Td10 and Td16 vaccine implementation’. The event ended with the administration of the ‘Immunization Pledge’ by Dr.Harsh Vardhan.

Present at the event were Shri. Ashiwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Shri. Devendra Kumar Joshi, Lt. Governor of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Shri. Mangal Pandey, Health Minister of Bihar, Ms. Preeti Sudan, Health Secretary and other senior officers of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ms. Poonam Khetarpal Singh, Regional Director, WHO-SEARO, Ms. Henrietta Fore, Executive Director, UNICEF, the MPs and MLAs who supported the Pulse Polio Programme and representatives of Rotary International and Development Partners – Dr. Sunil Behl, Dr. John Rhodes, Dr. Rajendra Saboo, Dr. Jon Andrus, Dr. S K Mittal.

India is committed to eliminate two of these NTDs - Lymphatic Filariasis (Hathipaon) and Visceral Leishmaniases (Kala-Azar) that put the future of our children at high risk.” Dr. Harsh Vardhan suggested that all health partners and stakeholders need to actively work on cross-sector collaboration because to tackle NTDs, true partnerships are essential. “India’s achievements so far have been significant, and this is an opportune time for us to consolidate the successes and finish the job of achieving LF elimination by 2021”, Union Health Minister stated.

 As Dr. Harsh Vardhan signed the ‘Call to Action to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis by 2021’ he said “While we have taken significant steps to ensure more people are not affected by these NTDs, what we need now is a common vision driven towards achieving the elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis. This however, will only be possible if we foster greater collaboration and commitment by all stakeholders including global public health experts, national & state representatives, partners & donors”. Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and other delegates also signed the Call to Action to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis by 2021.

Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare said, “I am happy to announce today that India is set to scale-up the use of Triple Drug Therapy (IDA) in a phased manner starting from next month - November 2019 and we are working with state governments and our partners to ensure high level of compliance to these drugs by communities living in endemic districts.”

Since the launch of the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) by the World Health Organization in 2000, endemic countries across the world including India have adopted a twin pillar strategy - prevention through Mass Drug Administration (MDA) using combination of 2 anti-filarial drugs (DEC and Albendazole), and, providing Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention (MMDP) services to those affected by the disease. Renewing India’s commitment towards elimination, the Government launched the Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (APELF) in 2018, and as part of intensifying efforts towards elimination later rolled out IDA treatment in a phased manner. By the end of February 2019, India successfully rolled out IDA across 4 districts including Arwal in Bihar (20 December 2018), Simdega in Jharkhand (10 January 2019), Nagpur in Maharashtra (20 January 2019) and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh (20 February 2019). A total of 8.07 million people out of 10.7 million vulnerable people (75.4%) were benefitted with the IDA medicines.

Also present at the event were Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH, Senior Officers of MoHFW, ICMR, NITI Aayog and UN Organisations.

He said that the priorities of Government of India in health care were included in the National Health Policy 2017 and this recommendation report by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has shown the implementation angle for achieving the same.He further added that this may be considered as the biggest leap of GoI towards achieving the goal of Universal Healthcare Coverage (UHC) with impetus on Digital Healthcare component. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhansaid that “The need of the hour is to create an ecosystem which can integrate theexisting disparate health information systems and show clear path for upcoming programmes. There is a need to ensure convergence across these IT systems to monitor and provide health services in a robust and efficient manner. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has initiated efforts in the direction of a comprehensive, nationwide integrated e-Health system under National Digital Health Blueprint.”

NDHB will help in providinga common platform for integration of existing applications in health domain and data which has existed in silos, either in public health facility, or, in private healthcare facility, in India. It was also updated that building on the initial document of “National Health Stack” (NHS) by NitiAayog, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has defined clear timelines, targets and the resources required for this digital convergence of Healthcare programmes in India.

Narendra Modi, to reach each individual of this country with services at their doorstep under Digital India Programme and hoped that implementation of NDHB with programmes of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare would benefit every individual.

                “Counterfeit food items, being totally illegal, bypass all mandatory quality checks and pose a grave danger to the health of our citizens. It is absolutely imperative that the problem is dealt with effectively” saidSecretary(HFW) Ms. Preeti Sudan at the video-conference (VC)addressing the Principal Secretaries of States and UTs, here today. 

High Court of Delhi vide order dated 19.08.2019 had directed the Secretary of Health and Family Welfare to hold a meeting of the Food Safety Departments of the State Governments along with FSSAI and submit a report on the manner in which counterfeiting of food products can be tracked, recorded and curbed in an effective manner. The video conference was held in compliance to the High Court order. 

Secretary, HFW highlighted the issue of counterfeit food products and requested the Principal Secretaries to hold periodic drives with the help of police authorities so that the menace is kept in check. The need for stepping up surveillance during the festival time was also emphasized. Ms. Sudan added that there is a need to ensure requisite availability of manpower for all activities of food safety, “States/UTs need to clearly identify the number of Designated officers (DO) and Food Safety officers (FSO) posts required for food safety administration and take steps to create the posts and fill them. Similarly, technical posts in laboratories need to be filled up, besides upgrading of the laboratories.” Secretary (HFW) emphasized that the Deputy Commissioners/ District Magistrates must be sensitized by State/ UT Governments to curb counterfeit food and they should take up a leadership role in drives against such activity. Principal Secretaries were requested to pass on directions to the Food Commissioners;as the implementation of the Food Safety and Standard Act, 2006 primarily rests with the States and UTs, there has to be effective implementation of the same. The Secretary(HFW) further added that strong action against counterfeit food products must be taken and brought to the notice of the public to generate awareness; the Health Secretaries of States/UTs must review the action taken every month and inform FSSAI.

The VC saw attendance of various States/ UTs including Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telangana, Manipur, Puducherry, Goa, Chandigarh, Tripura, Meghalaya and Himachal Pradesh. The Principal Secretaries explained the steps being taken by their States & UTs to tackle the issue under discussion. Some States have well designed calendars for food safety drives which are shared with enforcement agencies at the beginning of the year. Many States ensure that every complaint about quality and genuineness of food products is verified, which has yielded good results. It was discussed that training of officers and enhancing surveillance capabilities is necessary, successful raids should be given wide publicity through the media, consumer awareness needs to be promoted and they must be encouraged to insist on bills while purchasing food products etc.. Most States also felt that food manufacturers must introduce, track and trace mechanisms for their products. States were requested to cross learn from each other and adopt as many of these best practices as they find feasible. The Principal Secretaries of the States and UTs were also requested to participate in the meetings of Central Advisory Committee of FSSAI.

Also present at the VC were Senior Officers of MoHFW.

                “Let us renew our pledge to reach every single child to save them from Vaccine Preventable Disease (VPDs)” said the Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare Dr. Harsh Vardhan,the pioneer of Pulse polio programme in the country, here today. 

Addressing the media on the celebration of the Silver Jubilee of the Pulse Polio Programme, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that an event is scheduled to be held on 31st October, 2019 at Dr. Ambedkar International Center, Janpath with an expected gathering of around 800-900 delegates.Speaking on the occasion, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that India being declared Polio free in 2014 was a long and momentous journey, “It all began with a single thought that if ballot papers can reach each person, two life saving drops of vaccination too can reach every child”. The success of administering polio vaccination drops to12 lakh children through 4000 ‘polio kendras’ on 2nd October, 1994 in the city of Delhi, led to a countrywide movement and Pulse Polio Program was taken countrywide a year later in 1995. Dr. Harsh Vardhan thanked all stakeholders who contributed to this campaign, “India achieved this monumental triumph with the strong Government leadership, hard work and dedication of frontline health workforce, community and religious influencers, health officials, state governments, civil society organizations, professional bodies like IMA, IAP etc., partners such as WHO, Rotary and UNICEF and most importantly the support of our countrymen”. The Hon’ble Minister further added that the best practices and the systems established by the Pulse Polio programme have benefitted other health programs, viz. the community mobilization, logistics management, reaching the last mile or setting up a surveillance system. The learnings from Pulse Polio programme have helped implementation of other immunization programme i.e. the Mission Indradhanush (MI) and the Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI), “our Prime Minister, Shri.Narendra Modi ji recognized the MI as a flagship programme and included it in the multi-ministerial programme like the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (GSA) as well as the Extended Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (EGSA) and we were able to reach and immunize crores of children across the country”. Dr. Harsh Vardhan also mentioned thatsince the Modi ji led NDA Government has taken charge in 2014, the Universal Immunization (UIP) basket of vaccines has expanded to cover 12 Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) from the earlier 7. As of today, “Mission Indradhanush and related drives have successfully reached out to and vaccinated 3.39 crore children and 87.2 Lakh pregnant women in India. The hallmark of these drives has been strong political commitment, strong convergence with 12 other ministries like MWCD, MoHRD, Youth & Sports Ministry etc.”. The Minster also discussed the agenda of the 31st October, 2019 Silver Jubilee event stating that it will a day to celebrate with the stalwarts of the Polio Campaign and mark India’s remarkable successes in child healthcare and immunization. He highlighted that it will be a day to renew the pledge and energize all stakeholders to continue to work together to ensure 100% coverage with all lifesaving and absolutely free of cost vaccines available under Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). Hon’ble Health Minster further informed that the program on 31st October, 2019 will last for 3 hours and will have a film on journey of Pulse Polio. It will also have a panel discussion featuring the prominent personnel of that era. During the event, 16 districts who achieved 90% full immunization coverage during IMI in 2017-18 will also be rewarded. 

In 1988, the World Health Assembly (WHA) passed a resolution to launch the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). The Government of Delhi, under leadership of Dr. Harsh Vardhan,  piloted the first ever large scale supplementary immunization campaign with OPV in 1994 giving birth to the “Pulse Polio” immunization campaign with the iconic ‘Do Boond Zindagi Ki’ tagline, on 2nd October 1994, Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday. The campaign in Delhi reached nearly one million children up to the age of three years with two doses of OPV being administered on 02 October and 04 December through exclusive booth-based strategy. This strategy was later adopted and implemented by Government of India as Pulse Polio Campaigns. India’s attainment of polio-free status in 2014 was coined by the World Health Organization as “one of the most significant achievements in public health,” and marked not just India but the entire South East Asia Region being declared polio-free.

Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare said, “We are trying to simulate the Polio progamme passion of Hon’ble Minister for the Routine Immunization (RI) Programme. Convergent action is our main strategy with emphasis on involving the parent and families of children, to ensure that no child gets affected by VPDs.”

Also present at the event were Senior Officers of MoHFW.

                Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare attended the G20 Okayama Health Ministers’ Meeting on October 19-20, 2019, held under the Presidency of Japan in Okayama City, Japan.

The deliberations of the G 20 Health Ministers focused on four major global health issues, namely (i) Achievement of Universal Health Coverage (ii) Response to population aging (iii) Management of health risks and health security management including Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) and its containment. Union Health Minister made specific interventions on all of them.

Intervening on Universal Health coverage (UHC), Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of  ‘Sab Ka Saath; Sab Ka Vikas; Sab Ka Vishwas’ for inclusive health was highlighted along with Ayushman Bharat, FIT India Movement and Eat Right Campaign. Union Health minister confided that India is on the path to UHC and will contribute effectively in sustaining UHC at the global level.

On “Response to Population Aging” Union Minister for Health and Family  Welfare, during his intervention,  shared  India’s vision for its  projected 20% elderly population by 2050. He conveyed to G20 countries the efforts done so far under National Programme for Health Care of Elderly to provide accessible, affordable, and high-quality long-term, comprehensive health care services to an ageing population.  In his intervention he also made a mention of public health measures to tackle Dementia.  He concluded his intervention by highlighting India’s commitment to ensure dignity with care for its elderly.

Deliberating on Health risk and health security, Union Health Minister made intervention on Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR), seen as a serious emerging threat to global public health.  He conveyed G20 Health Ministers that in a short span of time India has made commendable progress by implementing a national action plan, establishing a national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system, and its decision to contribute to global AMR R&D efforts.  While voicing his concern on AMR, he called upon all relevant UN agencies to align themselves in their endeavour to combat antimicrobial resistance.

During the Simulation Exercise on “Public Health Emergency during mass gathering” on 20th October, 2019, Union Health Minister shared two best practices (i) successful pulse polio campaign in Delhi in 1994 threatened by a major outbreak of Plague during the same period and (ii) the risk communication management to bring down the mass hysteria created by Social media during Nipah outbreak in  Kerala in 2018.

The G20 Health Ministers meeting concluded by adopting the “Okayama Declaration of the G 20 Health Ministers”. The declaration, having 52 articles endorses the Commitment of G20 countries to address the major global health issues, as highlighted above and to pave the way towards an inclusive and sustainable world, as envisioned in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.

                “By motivating key players in the system who can reach out to people at large, we can reach out to each and every individual. We have to include every section of the society so that Eat Right India becomes a country wide movement.” Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare said at the function to commemorate World Food Day 2019, here today.  The theme for this day was ‘Healthy Diets for a Zero Hunger World’. To mark the occasion, Dr Harsh Vardhan also launched the ‘Food Safety Mitra (FSM)’ scheme, along with the ‘Eat Right Jacket’, and ‘Eat Right Jhola’ to strengthen food safety administration and scale up the ‘Eat Right India’ movement. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan emphasized that the Eat Right India movement is a crucial trigger for the much needed social and behavioural change. This campaign along with the ‘Fit India' Movement' can achieve huge success if the right strategy is adopted and efforts are made to reach out to every section of the society. Dr. Harsh Vardhan further stated that people should adopt Gandhiji’s messages of eating less, eating safe and healthy food, and also reduce wastage of food while developing the habit of sharing surplus food.  Citing the example of polio to highlight multi-sectoral approach, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated “All of us have to take up this responsibility in our own capacities. I believe that together we will be able to develop new approaches to combat challenges to health and society,” he added. 

Highlighting the critical importance of a Jan Andolan on issues around food safety, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that small positive actions can be performed by individuals or organisations to strengthen the cause of food safety and food wastage. 

The ‘Food Safety Mitra (FSM)’ scheme will support small and medium scale food businesses to comply with the food safety laws and facilitate licensing and registration, hygiene ratings and training. Apart from strengthening food safety, this scheme would also create new employment opportunities for youth, particularly with food and nutrition background. The FSMs would undergo training and certification by FSSAI to do their work and get paid by food businesses for their services. The first batch of 15 FSMs were awarded certificates today (Details of the scheme are available at https://fssai.gov.in/mitra/).

The ‘Eat Right Jacket’ launched today will be used by the field staff. This jacket has a smart design to hold tech devices like tablets/smart phone, a QR code and RFID tag for identification and tracking. Apart from providing safety to field staff on duty, this would bring in efficiency, professionalism and transparency in food safety administration and bring in a sense of ownership & visibility of FSOs.  The ‘Eat Right Jhola’, a reusable cloth bag shall replace plastic bags for grocery shopping in various retail chains. Since on repeated use, bags are often contaminated with microorganisms and bacteria, proper and regular washing of cloth bags is essential to ensure safety and hygiene. These cloth bags are being provided on rental basis through a private textile rental service company. 

FSSAI has partnered with the Domestic Workers Sector Skill Council (DWSSC) under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to launch a training course for domestic workers and homemakers across the country. In the first phase, one lakh domestic workers and homemakers will be trained through training partners of DWSSC in association with RWAs. This would be scaled up in due course. 

For scaling up the Eat Right India movement across the country, FSSAI has got endorsement of several celebrities. Two short films, on repurposing of used cooking oil into biodiesel and, nutrition in the first 1000 days of life featuring Shri Virat Kohli and Ms. Juhi Chawla respectively, were released on the occasion. 

Dr. K. Subramanian, Chief Economic Advisor, Govt. of India, Mr. Arun Maira, former member of Planning Commission of India & former India Chairman of Boston Consulting Group, Shri Santosh Desai, CEO, Future Brands and Shri Sangram Singh, the world renowned professional wrestler were also present at the function. Also present at the event were Shri Pawan Agarwal, Chief Executive Officer (FSSAI), Shri Amod K. Kanth, founder of Prayas, along with other stakeholders from the Government, Scientific community, food businesses and corporates of the sector.

                “Kayakalp award has made you an inspiration towards ‘swachhta’ in your community and region. Now you should become role models for other health facilities and inspire and lead your community and districts towards achieving the highest standards of cleanliness and hygiene.” Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare motivated and urged the winning public and private health facilities during the national felicitation ceremony of Kayakalp awardees (2018-19) for their work in maintaining high standards of sanitation and hygiene, in the presence of Shri. Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS (HFW), here today. For the first time, private health facilities were also felicitated for their work.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan commended the awardees and said that cleanliness is no more a  one-time activity but is integrated in our day-to-day practices and should become a habit. Kayakalp has played a pivotal role in reinstating and reconfirming trust and confidence of the community in public health facilities. He further added that the zest and zeal shown by the hospitals and their collective efforts in improving cleanliness, hygiene and infection control practices should continue unabated.”It is now your duty, to take upon the leadership role and mentor and monitor the Ayushman Bharat- Health & Wellness Centers (AB-HWCs) of your Districts, States and UTs”, he added.

The Union Health Minister further stated that health and hygiene are the top priorities of our Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi ji. “Taking a leaf from the life of Mahatma Gandhi, our Prime Minster has inspired, implemented and monitored the ‘Swachh Bharat Movement’. Dreaming of rolling out such an ambitious public health movement in such a vast country in itself is monumental, he stated. “We must now resolve to come together, make concerted efforts and contribute to his vision of a clean India, a happy & healthy India”.

Addressing the event, Shri. Ashiwini Kumar Choubey stated that “our efforts towards cleanliness and hygiene, in any shape and form, are like an offering, a ‘swachhaanjli’ to the father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi ji as the nation celebrates his 150th birth anniversary”.

At the function, the Health Ministers released the Kayakalp Coffee Table book documenting the success journeys of the award winning health facilities, and also gave away the awards to the winners under various categories.

                Urging the participating Health Ministers from States/UTsto increase healthcare spending to a minimum 8% of their State budget so as to meet the goals of healthcare spending of National Health Policy 2017- 2.5% of GDP by 2025, Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that “From the first CCHFW meeting to today, we together have achieved several health milestones, especially India being certified Polio-free. This has been possible because of our collaborative efforts. If all Health Ministers come together for a cause, no task can be impossible.” He was inaugurating the 13th Conference of the Central Council of Health and Family Welfare (CCHFW), in the presence of Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS (HFW), Dr V K Paul, Member (Health), Niti Aayog, Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), and Health Ministers from 13 states,here today. 

Speaking at the event, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that the purpose of the CCHFW meeting is to build a consensus on the national health priorities i.e. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) through Ayushman Bharat, eliminating TB and other priority agenda such as strengthen medical infrastructure. This can be achieved by collective increase in healthcare spending by the States/UTs to meet the goals of healthcare spending of National Health Policy 2017- 2.5% of GDP by 2025. “This is the first time that a government is so committed to healthcare and health care is on the top agenda. This is clearly visible from the passionate address of our Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi ji at the recently concluded UN General Assembly where he stressed upon four pillars of healthcare, which included universal health coverage; mission mode interventions; quality and accessible affordable healthcare services; and also adequate infrastructure.  Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated “Health needs to become a social movement in every State & UT and the Eat Right and Fit India movements need to be taken up by States & UTs in a synergized manner, to ensure a healthy & robust India”. The Minister also urged the Health Minister of Uttar Pradesh, who is also the Finance Minister of the State, to increase the health budget of the State and set an example for the rest to emulate. 

Speaking at the occasion, Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) said that the health Ministry is dedicated to the cause of effective, affordable, quality and accessible healthcare. She added that the CCHFW is integral to achievement of health goals of the country, “Without the political leadership and commitment of the States & UTs, healthcare cannot be effective”, she added.

Dr Vinod K. Paul, Member, NITI Aayogunderscored two priority areas for the public health sector. “First is increasing the health budgets by the Centre and the States/UTs, and second in enhancing the health infrastructure. The NHP 2017 commitment to increasing the health budget cannot be achieved without States contribution”, he stated. He added that there is a need to engage more with the private sector for augmenting the efforts of the public sector to bring in equity to increase the number of beds and hospitals to meet the global standards of health infrastructure.

                “The country is passing through a phase of not only transition, but also immense productive transformation in the health sector”. This was stated by Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare Dr Harsh Vardhan as he launched ‘The WHO India Country Cooperation Strategy 2019–2023: A Time of Transition’, here today. The Country Cooperation Strategy (CCS) provides a strategic roadmap for WHO to work with the Government of India towards achieving its health sector goals, in improving the health of its population and bringing in transformative changes in the health sector. 

Speaking at the event, the Health Minister stated that the four areas identified for strategic cooperation of WHO with the country encompass: to accelerate progress on UHC; to promote health and wellness by addressing determinants of health; toprotect the population better against health emergencies; and to enhance India’s global leadership in health. He added that under the vision and leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, the country has seen phenomenal advances made in various aspects of the health sector. Dr Harsh Vardhan stressed on the need for health to be made a people’s movement where the positive health attitude is inculcated in everyone, and everyone takes responsibility of their own health through preventive and promotive health approach. He mentioned about various social initiatives taken up such as Eat Right India movement, Fit India movement and Poshan Abhiyaan that have collectively engaged with the people and enhanced the awareness around these crucial health areas through people’s participation.  

Dr. Harsh Vardhan added that besides the health priorities detailed in the strategy, focus needs to be given on other equally pertinent health areas of environmental and occupational health, accidents and road injuries, and good nutrition and food safety.Emphasizing the need of inter-ministerial collaboration for a healthy nation, Dr. Harsh Vardhan suggested that a mechanism needs to be institutionalized wherein every ministry has a health section/department, so that every policy factors in its health implications.

Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) stated that India is conscious of the challenges that still exist. Given this, the document needs to have flexibility in order to factor in the changing health scenario in the country. She added that the CCS builds upon the work that WHO has been carrying out in the last several years. “In addition, it identifies current and emerging health needs and challenges such as non-communicable diseases, antimicrobial resistance and air pollution. We are fully committed to this collaborative strategy”, she added.

Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to India said “The implementation of this CCS will build on the remarkable successes in public health that India has demonstrated to the world. It’s a great opportunity to showcase India as a model to the world in initiatives such as digital health, access to quality medicines and medical products, comprehensive hepatitis control program and Ayushman Bharat. We are geared to step-up to leverage opportunities and address challenges to ensure maximum public health impact.” 

The India CCS is one of the first that fully aligns itself with the newly adopted WHO 13th General Programme of Work and its 'triple billion' targets, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHO South-East Asia Region’s eight Flagship Priorities. It captures the work of the United Nations Sustainable Development Framework for 2018–2022. The CCS outlines how WHO can support the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and other allied Ministries to drive impact at the country level. The strategy document builds on other key strategic policy documents including India’s National Health Policy 2017, the many pathbreaking initiatives India has introduced — from Ayushman Bharat to its National Viral Hepatitis programme and promotion of digital health amongst others. 

Also present at the event were Shri.Manoj Jhalani AS&MD (MoHFW), Dr. Balram Bhargav (DG-ICMR), Shri. Lav Agrawal (JS, International Helath, MoHFW), Mr. Alok Kumar (Director, NITI Aayog), Ms. Payden (Deputy WHO Representative to India), Dr. Roderico Ofrin Director-Programme Management-WHO-SEARO), Dr. Bilali Camara (Country Director, UNAIDS) and heads of other UN bodies.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of the Progress under National Health Mission (NHM) and Decisions of the Empowered Programme Committee and Mission Steering Group of the NHM.

Key elements Salient features:


	There has been acceleration in decline of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), Under Five Mortality Rate (U5MR) and the IMR since the launch of the NRHM/NHM. At the current rate of decline, India should able to reach its SDG target (MMR-70, U5MR-25) much before the due year i.e. 2030.
	India was the biggest success story amongst Malaria endemic countries in the World, in bringing down the Malaria cases and deaths which have declined by 49.09% and 50.52% in 2013 respectively compared to 2017.
	Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) has been significantly strengthened and intensified. A total of 1,180 CBNAAT machines across all districts have been installed which provides rapid and accurate diagnosis for TB including drug resistant TB. This has resulted in three-fold increased use of CBNAAT over the past year. Due to the intensified efforts, there is 16% jump in identification of new cases in one year. Universal drug sensitive cases also increased by 54%. Newer drug regimen of Bedaquiline and Delaminide and nutrition support to all the TB patients for the duration of the treatment has been rolled throughout the country.
	In 2018-19, 52744 AB-HWCs were approved against which 17149 HWCs were operationalized against the target of 15000.A total of 1, 81,267 Health workers which included ASHAs, MPHWs, Staff Nurses and PHC-MOs were trained on NCDs during 2018-19. The states have initiated activities to operationalize the HWCs.
	Amongst the new vaccines, Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine replaced Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine under universal immunization programme in 2018 to ensure Diphtheria immunity among adults.
	In 2018, Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccination drive was conducted in 17 additional States, thereby covering 30.50 Crores children till March 2019.
	During 2018-19, Rotavirus vaccine (RVV) was introduced in additional two States. Till today, all the States/UTs are covered with RVV. 
	During 2018-19, Pneumococcal Conjugated Vaccine (PCV) was expanded to MP, Haryana and the remaining districts of Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.   
	The routine and recurring incentives of ASHAs got increased from 1000 per month to 2000 per month. ASHAs and ASHA Facilitators were provided the cover of Pradhan Mantri Jevan Jyoti BeemaYojna (Premium of Rs. 330 contributed by Gol) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BeemaYojna (Premium of Rs.12 contributed by Gol).  
	Anaemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) Abhiyaan was launched under POSHAN Abhiyaan in April 2018.   
	The untied funds amount was increased from Rs, 20,000 to Rs 50,000 for sub health Centres transformed to HWCs. 
	Home Based Care for Young Child (HBYC) programme was introduced under POSHAN Abhiyaan. 
	The scheme for awarding States/UTs/Districts for achieving disease free status in TB/Leprosy/Malaria/Kala-Azar/Lymphatic-Filariasis/Cataract was approved. This will allow certification of the districts/ states as Disease Free ahead of the national certification and promote healthy competition among states and districts, similar to ODF districts and states.  
	National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme was approved for prevention, management and treatment of Hepatitis to A, B, C and E and rollout was initiated. This would benefit an estimated 5 crore patients of Hepatitis.

                Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare launched the eDantseva website and mobile application, the first ever national digital platform on oral health information and knowledge dissemination, here today. This marks an important milestone as e-DantSeva will reach out to more than one billion people with one click in the form of a dedicated website and mobile application. The Union Health Minister also released the Braille booklet and Voice over on Oral Health Education for the visually impaired individuals, along with the oral health posters for pregnant women and children.

At the event, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that these significant initiatives have taken inspiration from the importance given to digital platforms for people’s knowledge and information by the Hon. Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji. “e-DantSeva is the first ever national digital platform that provides oral health information both in the form of a website and mobile application,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said. He further added that oral health is indispensable for the wellbeing and good quality of life. “Poor oral health affects growth negatively in all aspects of human development,” he said. He further said that dental caries/cavities and periodontal disease remain the two most prevalent dental diseases of the Indian population and dental infections have a potential for serious diseases/infections. This initiative of the Ministry with AIIMS and other stakeholders aims to sensitize the public about the significance of maintaining optimum oral health and equips them with the tools and knowledge to do so, including awareness on the nearest oral health service facility. The website and mobile application provide oral health information gathered from authentic scientific resources and connects the public to timely advice for managing any dental emergency or oral health problem.

e-DantSeva contains information about the National Oral Health Program, detailed list of all the dental facility and colleges, Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material and a unique feature called the ‘Symptom Checker’, which provides information on symptoms of dental/oral health problems, ways to prevent these, the treatment modes, and also directs the user to find their nearest available dental facility (public and private sectors both).  The website also provides GPRS route/images/satellite images of the facility for easier access to the general population.

Braille is the primary reading method for the visually impaired people to access information and education independently. Dissemination of Printed Braille oral health books along with the voice-over among visually impaired individuals will provide them with the opportunity to read and hear about the essentials and importance of oral health. At the event, two visually impaired children demonstrated how the Braille booklets can be useful tools for such information.

The developed IEC material aims to eliminate the prevailing myths and misconception regarding maternal and child health and also encourages a visit to the dentist during pregnancy and early childhood years.

In 2014, National Oral Health Programme in its current form was introduced. The Center for Dental Education and Research (CDER), AIIMS, New Delhi functions as the National Center of Excellence for Implementation of NOHP. The Centre has been instrumental in providing consultation and support for the research and other activities for the National Oral Health Program.

Also present at the function were Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health) and Prof. Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS New Delhi, Dr O P Kharbanda, Chief, Centre for Dental Education and Research, AIIMS, Dr Ashok Dhoble, Secretary, Indian Dental Association and students and faculty from Blind Relief Association (BRA) along with other senior officers from the Health Ministry and faculty of AIIMS.

                Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare launched the “Trans Fat Free” logo of Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), at the 8th International Chefs’ Conference (ICC VII), here today. This marked an important milestone in the movement against Trans-Fats and also provided a momentum to accelerate the ‘Eat Right India’ movement of FSSAI.

At the event, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that: “The ‘Eat Right India’ movement of FSSAI takes inspiration from the vision of the Hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modji ji of giving to the people of this country a ‘New India’ by 2022 that includes health, social security and nutrition. The Prime Minister has also acknowledged the ‘Eat Right Movement’ of FSSAI in his “Mann ki Baat” address”. He further stated that health does not merely mean absence of disease and infirmity but its definition also includes the presence of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellness, and food plays a vital role in all these components. Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the primacy given to nutrition and healthy eating practices by the Government forms the pivot of the Poshan Maah, which was observed in September, where many ministries and stakeholders joined hands for enhancing awareness about issues surrounding nutrition. 

The Union Health Minister said that “Trans fats are the worst type of fats with known health risks. India is committed to eliminating it from the food supply and is progressing towards its objective of trans fat elimination by 2022; a year ahead of the global target by WHO. As part of our collective vision, FSSAI is committed to reducing the industrially produced trans fatty acids to less than 2% by the year 2022 in a phased manner and is geared up to get freedom from trans fats with the motto ‘India@75; Freedom from Trans Fats’.  It is encouraging to see chefs from across the country coming forward to support FSSAI in this cause and working towards a healthier India”. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan appreciated the bakeries for voluntarily adopting healthier cooking practices to eliminate trans fats. He further stated that it is a national and social responsibility for all of us, and especially for the chefs as they carry an additional responsibility of ensuring that the food served is not just safe and tasty, but also healthy. He congratulated FSSAI for its efforts in mobilizing various stakeholders to work cohesively and take the ‘Eat Right India’ movement forward. 

At the event, Dr Harsh Vardhan released a slogan ‘Chefs 4 Trans Fat Free’, under which more than 1,000 chefs from different parts of the country took a pledge to use trans-fat free oils in their recipes and work towards their elimination from the diets of Indian populace at large. The Union Health Minister also released a trans-fat free brochure, trans-fat free manifesto for chefs, and distributed pins to five chefs as an acknowledgement for them adopting trans-fat free recipes. He also felicitated ten bakeries who are using trans-fat free oils in their products and those that committed to use trans-fat free oils in the future.

Dr Harsh Vardhan also launched the Green Purple initiative logo. The initiative aims to qualify the chefs on food safety legal requirements and sustainable cooking methods, in order to promote trans-fat free cooking. It will be a six months program that includes key areas of trans-fat free cooking, using less sodium, and hygienic, seasonal, eco-friendly, less energy consuming cooking methods. The chefs shall thereafter ensure global standards of food safety and sustainable environment practices.

Industrial trans-fats are made by adding hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid, and to increase the shelf life of foods. Trans-fats are largely present in partially hydrogenated vegetable fats/oils, vanaspati, margarine and bakery shortenings, and can be found in baked and fried foods.

The food establishments which use trans-fat free oil and do not have industrial trans-fat more than 0.2g/100g of food, in compliance with the Food Safety and Standards (Advertising and Claims) Regulations, 2018 can display “Trans-fat free” logo at their outlets and on their food products. The use of the said logo is voluntary.    

Thanking the food industry for their proactive support in taking forward the ‘Eat Right India’ movement, Shri Pawan Agarwal, CEO, FSSAI said that “FSSAI is committed to reducing the industrially produced trans fatty acids to less than 2% by the year 2022 in a phased manner. I am hopeful that the Chef community will work with us in achieving this goal.”

During the event, sessions were also held on FSSAI’s Hygiene Rating and Right Place to Eat Scheme which is an online, transparent scoring and rating system that aims to empower consumers with informed food choices while eating out. Chefs were encouraged to adopt this scheme across the country to showcase that they are the ‘Right Place to Eat’. Another session focused on the need for reducing sodium/salt content from Indian diets. Chefs were encouraged to prepare recipes with less salt as it reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke even among those who do not have high blood pressure.

Also present at the event were members of the food sector fraternity including the scientific community, industry and industry associations, medical and nutrition experts as well as renowned chefs from across the globe highlighting the need to eliminate trans fats from the food supply.

                The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO) formally announced the re-designation of National Health Systems Resource Centre (NHSRC), as the WHO Collaborating Centre for Priority Medical Devices and Health Technology Policy. The mandate of the Division of Healthcare Technology at NHSRC is to draw up technical specifications for technologies procured under National Health Mission, draft policies for medical device maintenance and management, undertake evaluations of health product innovations, conduct Health Technology Assessments (HTA), and support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on issues related to diagnostics initiative, National Dialysis Program and other technology intensive services.

In the past, NHSRC as a collaborating centre has supported WHO in formulating technical specifications for medical devices such as oxygen concentrators and resuscitation devices and continues to support evaluation of innovations for WHO’s compendium on innovative devices. This year in collaboration with WHO’s country’s office, NHSRC developed a guidance document for the Ministry’s free diagnostics initiative to further strengthen the agenda of Universal access to affordable diagnostics. NHSRC also works with WHO on development of technical specification of Blood pressure measuring devices, In vitro diagnostics and devices for cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Future collaboration includes work on International Classification and Nomenclature for Medical Devices, which would improve access to affordable health technologies. 

Such global collaborations in the area of health technology will ensure that scientific and technological advances, research and development as well as innovative technologies play a substantial supportive role in healthcare and enable us to reach the public health goals and achieve universal health coverage.

                A high level Government - industry delegation led by Secretary in the Department of Heavy Industry, Dr. Asha Ram Sihag, is reaching out to top Czech companies, including Skoda Transporation to scale up their investment in India, leveraging the country as their global supply chain hub. 

Department of Heavy Industry in association with India's Embassy in Czech Republic and the Engineering Export Promotion Council of India (EEPC) organised 'India Investment Meet” at the International Engineering Fair (MSV) at Brno, in Czech Republic, on October 8, 2019. Asha Ram Sihag, Secretary Heavy Industry & Ambassador Narinder Chauhan inaugurated the India Pavilion at MSV Brno International Engineering Fair. An Indian pavilion with a strong presence of engineering and technology firms, is showcasing India’s capability to the global businesses at the prestigious fair being held from October 7 - 11, 2019.

Addressing global companies and Technology heads, Dr. Sihag briefed them on how India figures prominently on the investment radar of the top Czech companies. He said that Volkswagen Group is investing one billion Euros in the implementation of its project in India for developing new models, including a mid-size SUV to be showcased in 2020. Importantly, the technical development of new products will take place in India.

The Skoda group transportation has also developed hybrid vehicles and electric buses with the announcement of e-vehicles policy of Department of Heavy Industry. It holds specific interest for India in technology transfer and product development in the e-vehicle market, Dr. Sihag said, underscoring how the country is focusing on green fuel-driven automobile. 

Along with EEPC India senior leadership, the DHI Secretary will be visiting plants and facilities of several Czech companies and universities for apprising on R&D and technology development. 

In his presentation at the India Investment Meet, Secretary said that India has set a target of raising the size of the capital goods sector from Rs. 2.30 lakh crores in 2014-15 to Rs.7.5 lakh crore in 2025, raising direct and indirect employment to 30 million from 8.4 million at present. Exports must also account for 40 per cent of engineering goods production from 27 per cent at present. 

Addressing the gathering, India's Ambassador to Czech Republic, Mrs. Narinder Chauhan said that India is seeking foreign investment particularly in the high tech areas and further strengthening its manufacturing under the flagship 'Make in India ' programme. 

EEPC India Chairman, Ravi Sehgal said that with the Indian Government making the corporate tax rates competitive, foreign investors should invest in Indian manufacturing, especially when the two major economies of the world are locked in a trade war. The Government of India has slashed corporate tax to 22 per cent and even after surcharges and cesses, the effective rate is about 25 per cent. For new investment for plants going into stream before March 2023, the effective corporate tax rate is a shade above 17 per cent, which is very competitive for attractive investment into the ‘Make in India’ programmme. 

The International Engineering Fair (MSV) is the leading and prestigious industrial trade fair in Central Europe. More than 1600 exhibitors and 80,000 visitors participate in this fair each year. Over 50 per cent of exhibitors and 10 per cent of visitors come from abroad. There are several Indian companies operating in the Czech Republic Ltd.

Secretary Heavy Industry met with Karl Havlicek, Deputy Prime Minister, Czech Republic at MSV Brno and discussed initiatives to deepen engagement in R&D, mutual trade and cooperation.

                It has come to notice of the Government that lots of rumours and  misinformation is being spread in media including social media that final Naga settlement has been arrived at and will be announced soon. This is creating  anxiety and concern in some parts of the country. 

It is clarified that before any settlement is arrived at with Naga groups, all stakeholders including States of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh will be duly consulted and their concerns will be taken into consideration. 

No credence needs to be given to such rumours and incorrect information.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah inaugurated the new building of Delhi Police Headquarters (PHQ), at Jay Singh Marg in New Delhi, today. He also paid floral tributes at the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel; visited the 'Aadarsh' Auditorium and photo gallery, viewed an audio-visual presentation on the new PHQ and visited the CP office in the new building.

 



 

  

 

During his address on the occasion, Shri Shah congratulated all officers and jawans of Delhi Police for finally getting its new HQ building nearly after 70 years. He observed that Delhi Police has a rich history of accomplishments and sacrifices made by its officers and felt proud after inaugurating the new building. Remembering Sardar Patel on Rashtriya Ekta Diwas, Shri Shah said that there cannot be a more auspicious occasion than the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India to inaugurate the PHQ building.

Commemorating the contribution of Sardar Patel in national integration, Shri Shah said that Sardar has been known because of his actions taken, more than his words, for integrating over 550 princely states that the Britishers left disunited at the time of independence. Sardar accomplished a near impossible task of surmounting tough challenges in a short time and create a united India that we are proud of today. Had Sardar not been there, India would not have had the kind of stature and importance in the world that it has today, he added.

Shri Shah said that Sardar Patel was instrumental in reorganising the civil services in independent India. It was not a mere administrative change from Civil Services created by Britishers to civil services for independent India. It included transforming the spirit of the administrative machinery of the country from an high-handed and oppressive state machinery to a welfare-based and growth-oriented governance infrastructure. Shri Shah observed that Sardar Patel's contribution to India is unparalleled, whether it was during the freedom struggle or post independence. He felt the pulse of the Nation and remained connected to the grassroots till his last breath. Shri Shah said that successive governments had not recognized the contribution of Sardar Patel for many years after independence. The youth of the country must take his life as a case study and try to imbibe his values in their lives to understand India, as Sardar Patel embodied the true spirit of India, the Minister added.

Talking about the importance of the police in the progress of the Nation, Shri Shah said that a stable law and order situation is the most important aspect for economic growth and social development in the country. He observed that the police is perpetually projected in negative shade in popular media, but the round the clock sacrifices made by the officers and jawaans to secure the lives of citizens are seldom highlighted. Such a kind of negative protection demoralizes our police force. The public image of police needs to change, he said.

 



 

Shri Shah informed that the government is working with a well planned, time bound and scientific strategy under the vision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, to correct this situation. The Modi government has developed the National Police Memorial in New Delhi, which chronicles the sacrifices of over 34000 officers and jawans who have laid down their lives for the country. He made an emotional request to the public to visit the memorial and witness firsthand the challenges faced and sacrifices made by police forces for securing the Nation.

Having said this, Shri Shah noted that the police also needs to be proactive and responsive towards redressing the grievance of the public. He cautioned the Delhi Police that new buildings do not guarantee a reformed police force. It can be achieved only by transforming the spirit of policing towards being public service oriented. Only then the public image would improve and the efforts that the force is making would achieve the intended positive results. Shri Shah also reassured the public that Internal security is the top priority of Modi government and the security forces are working diligently towards accomplishing this commitment of the government.

Shri Shah concluded his address by paying tributes to Kirti Chakra awardees from Delhi Police as well as all the jawans across the country who have laid their lives for the Nation.

The new PHQ building is unique in its implementation and plans undertaken on a public private partnership mode, at a total cost of rupees 286 crores. The new PHQ is spread over an area of about 8 acres and the building has 18 floors, which is designed to accommodate all the functionally required officers, control rooms, conference rooms, control and communication centre. Owing to its central location, the building, which is disabled-friendly, will be accessible to public coming from all corners of Delhi for their grievance redressal.

Union Minister of Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah graced the ‘Rashtriya Ekta Diwas’ celebrations as Chief Guest and flagged off the ‘Run For Unity’ at Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, in New Delhi today. Earlier Shri Shah paid floral tributes at the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Patel Chowk, in New Delhi.

 



 

Addressing the gathering on the occasion Shri Shah said that Sardar Patel is the reason for a united India. He added that the nation would forever be grateful to Sardar. Expounding on the history of India's unification, Shri Shah said that at the time of Independence, India was divided into more than principalities by the British and the existence of a unified India was a challenge. It was only tireless perseverance by Sardar Patel, in spite of challenges, which led to the unification of India, Shri Shah said.

 

Shri Shah asserted that Run for Unity is a way for the people of India to reaffirm our commitment to a United, strong India and a fitting tribute to Sardar Patel. He noted that the merger of Jammu and Kashmir with India was the unresolved question of Indian unification because of Articles 370 and 35A. He added that it was under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that the task of merging Jammu and Kashmir with India was completed by the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A. He called this merger the unfinished dream of Sardar Patel and added that Article 370 was the gateway of terrorism in India. 

 



 

Shri Shah also remembered former Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi on her death anniversary. He remarked that Sardar Patel was not given his due for many years after independence. He said that the Statue of Unity, at 182 m, is one of the tallest statues in the world and a fitting tribute to Sardar Patel and a recognition of his contributions to India. 

 

Shri Shah said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India has become one of the fastest growing and largest economies of the world and is well poised to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024. Shri Shah called upon everyone to commit themselves to building a strong, united New India.

 



 

Shri Shah, after his address, administered the Pledge of Unity to all the participants and officials present at the venue. 

Also present on the occasion were the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Shri Anil Baijal, Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, Minister of State for Power, New & Renewable Energy (I/C) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri Raj Kumar Singh, Minister of State for Housing & Urban Affairs, Civil Aviation (Independent Charge) and Commerce & Industry, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports (I/C) Shri Kiren Rijiju and Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy.

People living in the low lying areas have been evacuated to shelter homes and are being provided food and water. Teams of Coast Guard and Indian Navy are on the standby for any eventuality. 

Senior officials of the Ministries of Home, Defence, as well as those from IMD and NDRF, attended the meeting. Senior officers from the UT Administration participated in the meeting through Video Conference.

                India has signed the Agreement with Pakistan today on the modalities for operationalisation of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor at Zero Point, International Boundary, Dera Baba Nanak. Representatives from the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Defence, and Ministry of Home Affairs along with the representatives from Government of Punjab have been present during the signing ceremony. 

 

It is very well known that the Union Cabinet passed a resolution on 22 November 2018 to celebrate the historic occasion of 550th Birth Anniversary of Sri Guru Nanak Devji in a grand and befitting manner, throughout the country and across the globe. 

 

In a landmark decision, the Union Cabinet also approved the building and development of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor from Dera Baba Nanak to the International Boundary, to facilitate pilgrims from India to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur, round the year, in a smooth and easy manner. 

 

With the signing of this Agreement, a formal framework has been laid down for operationalisation of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor. 

 

The highlights of the Agreement are: -


	Indian pilgrims of all faiths and persons of Indian origin can use the corridor;
	The travel will be Visa Free;
	Pilgrims need to carry only a valid passport;
	Persons of Indian Origin need to carry OCI card along with the passport of their country;
	The Corridor is open from dawn to dusk. Pilgrims travelling in the morning will have to return on the same day;
	The Corridor will be operational throughout the year, except on notified days, to be informed in advance;
	Pilgrims will have a choice to visit as individuals or in groups, and also to travel on foot;
	India will send the list of pilgrims to Pakistan 10 days ahead of travel date. Confirmation will be sent to pilgrims 4 days before the travel date;
	The Pakistan side has assured India to make sufficient provision for ‘Langar’ and distribution of ‘Prasad’;


 

The main issue that has been a point of discussion is the insistence of Pakistan to levy US Dollars 20 as service charge per pilgrim per visit. India has consistently urged Pakistan to not levy any fee on the pilgrims. It was stressed time and again, including in the previous three Joint Secretary Level meetings and at the diplomatic level, that this is not in consonance with the religious and spiritual sentiments of Indian pilgrims. India has shared its deep disappointment with Pakistan for its refusal to waive the fee. However, in the interest of the pilgrims and timely operationalization of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor before the 550th Prakash Purb, India has agreed to sign the Agreement today. While the Agreement has been signed, Government of India continues to urge this issue with the Government of Pakistan to reconsider its insistence on levying the fee. India remains ready to amend the Agreement accordingly.

India continues to pursue the issue of all-weather connectivity through the corridor. In this context, Government of India has built the bridge on Indian side and a temporary service road as an interim arrangement. It is expected that Pakistan will fulfil the assurance that it would build the bridge on their side at the earliest.

Provisions made for facilitation of Pilgrims 

All the required infrastructure viz., the highway and the Passenger Terminal Building are nearing completion for timely inauguration of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor. A robust security architecture has been put in place while facilitating smooth and easy passage of pilgrims.

 

For registration of pilgrims, online portal (prakashpurb550.mha.gov.in) has gone live today. The pilgrims may have to necessarily register themselves online on this portal and exercise their choice to travel on any day. Pilgrims will be informed by SMS and email of the confirmation of registration  3 to 4 days in advance of the date of travel.  An Electronic Travel Authorization will also be generated. The pilgrims need to carry Electronic Travel Authorization, along with their passport, when they arrive at the Passenger Terminal Building.

                Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy said that India continues with its policy of zero-tolerance against terrorism. Shri Reddy was speaking at the Police Commemoration Day organised by Assam Police in Guwahati today, where he asserted that Indian forces have been capable of thwarting all threats to India’s internal security and there have been a reduction in casualties of Police Personnel and civilians.

Addressing the gathering during the ‘Smriti Parade’, Shri Reddy said that the entire country salutes our police forces, their families and remember with pride those brave police personnel martyred in the line of duty this day on Police Commemoration Day. Acknowledging the exemplary service rendered by Assam Police, the Minister said that in the several decades of fighting insurgency and militancy Assam Police have displayed great professional qualities, courage and valour in the conduct of counter intelligence operations.

“Assam Police personnel have sacrificed their lives in battle against militants and insurgents, tackling crime, ensuring security in the border areas, maintenance of law & order, apart from helping the needy in times of floods and other natural disasters”, the Minister said. Since 1964, a total of 879 Assam Police Personnel have laid down their lives for maintenance of law order & order in the state, he added.

Lauding with great pride the supreme sacrifices made by Assam Police Personnel, Shri Reddy said that it is because of them that the security situation in Assam has completely changed and they have ushered in an era of peace and prosperity with a fillip to investment opportunities in the state. The entire state is carrying forward the Vision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi of Act East Policy in word and spirit, he added. The Minister attributed courage, sincerity and devotion to duty as hallmark of Assam Police.

While speaking to the media, the Minister appealed to all the remaining militant or insurgent groups of the Northeast to lay down their arms and join the mainstream where they can also contribute to progress of the nation. He added that everyone should abjure violence and in a democracy like India, there is no place for violence and that every difference can be sorted out through dialogue in a peaceful manner.

The Union Minister, DGP, Assam and other senior most officers of each rank present in the ‘Smriti Parade’ laid wreath at the Memorial column. During the programme, officers of the Assam Police Headquarters also read out the names of the Police Officers/Men who have lost their lives in harness during 01-09-2018 to 31-08-2019.

Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah presided over the occasion of the Police Commemoration Day and paid homage to the police personnel martyred in the line of duty at the National Police Memorial, in New Delhi today.

 



 

Police Commemoration Day owes its origin to the unflinching dedication and commendable courage of CRPF men. It was on this very day in 1959 when CRPF scripted a saga of valour and sacrifice in the snow-laden, inaccessible, inhospitable terrain of Hot Springs in Ladakh. A patrol party of twenty personnel of CRPF and Intelligence Bureau had gone to search for a missing reconnaissance party when it was ambushed by PLA (Chinese Army). In spite of the sudden attack and disadvantageous tactical position, they fought valiantly against the Chinese army personnel who were in large numbers and heavily armed.  In this battle, ten CRPF men were martyred in defense of the country. Since then, Police Commemoration Day is observed on 21st October every year to honor the loyalty and supreme sacrifice of police personnel for the nation.

 



Speaking on the occasion, Shri Shah recalled the battle of Hot Springs and remembered the valour of the CRPF men martyred in it. He acknowledged the service of all police personnel, and hailed the history of police forces as a legacy of pride and valour. 

 



 

Shri Shah commended all police personnel and called them the silent sentinels of the nation. He said that from the guarding of borders to traffic management and fighting the menace of illicit drugs to battling terrorism, police personnel have played a quiet yet seminal role in the nation’s development. He noted that the fruits of development can reach the last mile only when law and order are stable, and peace prevails, and police have an incredibly important role in ensuring that it does. 

Remembering the martyrs, Shri Shah said that 34844 police personnel have laid down lives in the line of duty till now. He noted that 292 martyrs were being added to that list today. Speaking on the difficult conditions under which police personnel operate, Shri Shah said that police forces in India are severely understaffed, with an actual strength of 144 police personnel per one lakh population as opposed to the sanctioned strength of 222. Shri Shah said that because of this shortage of manpower, most policemen work long hours and not take weekly leaves. While acknowledging the difficult realities of police work environment, Shri Shah sad that the Modi Government is committed to holistic welfare of police personnel – from residence and work environment to health and education. 

Ending his address, Shri Shah wished for the good health and welfare of all the police personnel.

                National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with Ministry of Jal Shakti conducted a national-level workshop on the Management of Floods: Reservoir Management, in New Delhi today.

Reservoirs store large volumes of water and play an important role in meeting irrigation, hydropower generation and other water needs of communities living in their vicinity. They are one of the most important structural measures for reducing the impact of floods, and their well thought-out operationalization is a pre-requisite to minimizing the frequency, duration and impact of floods in downstream areas. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri G. V. V. Sarma, Member Secretary, NDMA, referred to NDMA Guidelines of 2008 and 2010, which elaborated a number of action points by various agencies and State governments. He urged all stakeholder agencies and State governments to coordinate their efforts towards improved reservoir management in the country. He also called upon State Governments and agencies responsible for management of reservoirs to correlate the rainfall prediction data with 'Rule Curve' data for operationalizing dams.  

Shri Upendra Prasad Singh, Secretary, Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation emphasized the need for judicious operationalization of dams by State authorities based on the data provided by India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Central Water Commission (CWC). He agreed with the need to revisit the Rule Curves and requested all the State governments to undertake the task on priority. “There is a need to revisit our policies as the changing climate has posed new challenges,” he said. He also stressed the need to have proper dissemination of flood-related alerts and transparency in reservoir operations.

To set the tone of the workshop, NDMA made a presentation highlighting the progress made so far, key issues and challenges, and the way forward for improving our management of reservoirs for better flood control. 

Stakeholders discussed a range of issues pertaining to better management of reservoirs and the role of rainfall prediction, flood forecasting and early warning and wide dissemination of advisories and alerts. The need to manage gaps in reservoir operations and to remove encroachments on flood plains were also highlighted. State governments presented case studies on the management of dams.

It was decided to work towards an operational mechanism that would ensure timely exchange of information among all stakeholders so that reservoir operation during floods can be better regulated, based on advanced forecasting techniques.

NDMA Members and officials, senior officials from IMD, CWC, National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), representatives of State Governments and representatives of the civil society participated in the event.

                “Over usage of natural resources accelerate climate change and cause ecological imbalance on earth. It is a need of hour that we use our natural resources in a balanced manner to protect our environment. Plastic is hazardous for the planet and each human being is responsible to reduce it in day-to-day lives to save future of our generation”, said shri G. Kishan Reddy, Union minister of State for Home Affairs. This was at a tree plantation and plogging drive, organised by NDMC along with a drive on reducing single use plastic, in New Delhi today.

Shri Reddy said that the Prime Minister of India has urged the nation from the Red Fort to reduce the single plastic in our lives and save environment. Accordingly, protection of environment is not only the responsibility of civic bodies or government but it is the equal responsibility of every citizen and should make it a mass movement. He stressed upon the need for making more efforts for lessening air pollution level and maintaining ecological balance in New Delhi.

The Minister administered oath to school students, teachers, morning walkers and officials for ‘No to Single Use Plastic’. He also flagged off the teams of NDMC School students for plogging drive in Nehru Park by starting plogging himself. On the occasion, school children performed a very informative Nukkad Natak to spread the awareness about ‘No to Single Use Plastic’.

Chief Secretary, Delhi cum officiating Chairman, NDMC Shri Vijay Kumar Dev was also present on the occasion.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah addressed a seminar: Guptvanshak Veer: Skandagupta Vikramaditya at BHU, Varanasi. Also present on the occasion were the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath and Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Shri Mahendra Nath Pandey.

Shri Shah remembered the founder of BHU, Shri Madan Mohan Malviya and said that his legacy and the legacy of India’s glorious culture was kept alive by the institution. He emphasized upon the importance of educational institutions in preserving and promoting the culture of a society. 

Noting India’s rich cultural and political growth under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, Shri Shah remembered the contribution of both dynasties in ensuring the political stability of India. He remarked upon the role played by Gupta empire in the unification of India in ancient times. 

Hailing the Gupta Era under Samudragupta as the Golden Era of India, Shri Shah said that the boundaries of India under Samudragupta stretched the entire length of the subcontinent in his time. He added that in every field from art and architecture to trade and literature, India had achieved the pinnacle of civilization in the Gupta Era. Shri Shah called for recognizing the contribution of Skandagupta in making the Indian culture reach its zenith. He also remembered the battle campaign waged by Skandagupta against Hun invaders, and said that Skandagupta was one of the few warrior kings to have defeated Huns.

Shri Shah hailed Skandagupta as not only a great warrior, but also a skilled administrator. He said that in spite of having saved the nation from invaders, and having freed the region around Kashmir, history has not registered the contributions of Skandagupta or given him his due. He said that the responsibility to correct this lies with the present society. He called for the chronicling of history from the standpoint of Indian culture. He gave the example of Veer Savarkar, who was the first to have referred to the 1857 rebellion as the First War of India’s Independence, and called for more such efforts to ensure the writing of history from a nationalistic perspective.

Shri Shah said that under the vision and leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India has once again achieved prestige and respect on the global stage. He said that now India, as the largest democracy in the world, is recognized as an important voice in global affairs.

Shri Shah also launched a book on Skandagupta Vikramaditya on the occasion. He expressed hope that the legacy of BHU would be carried forward by the coming generations of students and scholars.

                Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri G Kishan Reddy addresses the National Conference of Chiefs of ATS/STFs organized by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Reddy congratulated the NIA and called terrorism a major challenge for the country, a curse for any civilized society and the biggest obstacle to modern development . He added that India has always been capable of meeting such challenges. He outlined the importance of NIA in the context of detailed investigation of terrorist incidents and said that the organization was vital to ensure national security.

Detailing the agency's work, Shri Reddy said that the NIA has registered 286 serious terrorism cases during its tenure of 10 years since its inception. Out of these, professional investigation of 210 cases has been successfully submitted in the NIA Special Courts. He noted that the success achieved by NIA in such a short time and the work it has done in the field of counter-terrorism has emerged as a veritable signature. Shri Reddy also congratulated the NIA for exposing Pakistan's role in Pathankot, Uri, Banihal and Handwara cases of terrorist attacks and in the manufacturing and circulation of fake Indian currency.

Shri Reddy remarked that India's national security challenges were functions of its unique geography, diversity and regional as well as global developments. He enumerated fundamentalism, separatism movements, extremism, communalism and Maoist violence as the major internal security challenges faced by India. He emphasized that all problems and grievances should be solved peacefully within the constitutional provisions of the nation.

Giving the example of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri Reddy said that the state of Jammu and Kashmir, despite being in India, was acting as a separate sovereign state due to disruptive and separatist activities. He added that the Government of India has merged the state of Jammu and Kashmir with India by removing Article 370. He noted that with the abrogation of Article 370, the Government has succeeded in crushing cross border sponsored terrorism to a and there would be all-round development of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Ladakh.

Shri Reddy said that the biggest challenge before the Government was to ensure a peaceful environment in the country so that the fruits of development reach everyone. He noted that our internal and external adversaries are keenly watching the remarkable development of India and want to disrupt the journey of this development, and urged the officers present to be mindful of this fact. He called Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism and jihadi terrorism the biggest external security challenge for the country.

Shri Reddy flagged the increasing use of cyberspace by terrorist organizations as an emerging global challenge and noted the role played by NIA in containing this new threat. He noted that the extent of cyberspace is wider than the national boundaries and therefore exercising effective jurisdiction over it is a very difficult task. He said that the only way to deal with this problem effectively is through international cooperation and coordination between all stakeholders.

Shri Reddy said that for decades India had waged a patient fight against terrorism, and that the Government is determined to eradicate terrorism completely. He hailed the success of security forces in bringing peace to the states of Punjab, North-East of India, Kashmir and parts of the country affected by Left Wing Extremism as a barometer of the security forces and agencies. He said that as the world's largest democracy, India has a duty to support the international community in fighting the menace of terrorism.

Shri Reddy called a strong legal framework with all the necessary infrastructure and human resources essential to defeat terrorism and noted the strengthening of the legal framework in India by making desired amendments in the anti-terrorist laws against terrorism, and by amending the NIA Act. 

Shri Reddy expressed confidence that after the seminar there would be better coordination between ATS /STF of different states and they would emerge stronger and stronger to deal with different aspects of terrorism.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah presided over as Chief Guest on the 35th Raising Day Ceremony of National Security Guard (NSG), at NSG HQ in Manesar, Gurugram today. The Home Minister viewed a splendid display of the preparedness of the NSG to tackle any terror attack against the country, during the event.

 



 



 

Shri Shah started his address by paying tributes to the NSG martyrs who have made the supreme sacrifice for the Nation. He expressed pride and confidence and said that NSG's capabilities in protecting the Nation from all acts of terrorism are unparalleled and it has always upheld its motto of 'Sarvatra, Sarvottam, Suraksha'.

Shri Shah said that terrorism is a curse for any modern developed society and is a roadblock for the growth and development of the people. India has been fighting the longest battle in the world against cross border terrorism. He said that Modi government's policy of ‘zero tolerance against terrorism’ is unchangeable and a force like NSG is fully capable and equipped to safeguard the Nation from terrorism, upholding this policy of the government. 



The Home Minister said that India is fighting a decisive battle to eliminate cross border terrorism in India, once and for all. Modi government has taken a bold decision to abrogate Article 370 for establishing a lasting peace in Kashmir. This, Shri Shah said, makes the role of India's commando's of prime importance in maintaining the internal security of the country. Shri Shah expressed confidence that NSG would always remain committed towards the Modi Government's vision of a 'World class Zero-Error force' and would play a decisive role in eliminating terrorism in India.

In today's time when unconventional warfare is the rule, Shri Shah said, NSG is always prepared and ready to protect the Nation, whether it is in terror attacks like Akshardham, 26/11, Pathankot airbase or any other anti-hijack, bomb diffusion operations. He said that NSG has impressed the world with its capability to counter any terror attack possible today. This inspires confidence in the minds of the people of the country that they are in safe hands, he added.



Shri Shah informed that in view of terror threat perception, Government of India in 2016 established the 5th regional hub of NSG in Gandhinagar. The brave and selfless commandoes of NSG have been equipped with latest anti-terror capabilities and weapons.  Giving importance to human capabilities over weapons, the Home Minister said that though capabilities like mobility surveillance, counter-drone firepower of NSG have been upgraded, yet any weapon cannot match a commando's bravery and patriotism.

Taking about the variety of activities undertaken by NSG, Shri Shah said that on one hand, NSG has trained with Special Forces of different countries and exchanged best practices, on the other, NSG officers have participated in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and other environmental conservation efforts, which is another form of service to the Nation. The Home Minister also congratulated NSG on its contingent unfurling the National Flag on Mt. Everest.

 

  

During the event, Shri Shah also presented medals for gallantry and exemplary service to NSG commandoes and their family members.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah presided over the 26th foundation day celebrations of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) as Chief Guest. Also present was Justice Shri HL Dattu, Chairperson, NHRC.

Shri Shah, praising the work done by NHRC, said that the organization had, over the last 26 years, created immense awareness about human rights in people. He added that the concept of human rights as applied in India was very different from that as applicable globally. He remarked that this was so because traditional Indian social structures and institutions have been the inherent protectors of several human rights, without any legal obligation needed to enforce this protection. He said that this shows the richness of our culture, and that protection and promotion of human rights has always been an indelible part of our culture. He said that ensuring synergy between our cultural values and the modern approach to human rights would make India the best in the world in terms of human rights. 

 



 

Shri Shah urged NHRC and other institutions involved in the field of human rights to rise above the confines of law and take the protection of human rights as a sacred ethical duty. He said that individuals and institutions involved in such efforts should be given space in the larger context of human rights ecosystem of India. He called for a broader definition of human rights and said that the Indian motto of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam has the protection and promotion of human rights in-built in it.

Shri Shah said that Gandhi ji's principles and values encompassed a wide scope of human rights and added that his favorite devotional song Vaishnava Jan To is one of the greatest charters of human rights. Shri Shah hailed the rich literature and philosophy of human rights present in Indian culture. He urged the NHRC to provide a platform to showcase such examples. 

Shri Shah remarked that poverty and violence were major challenges to human rights and said that any step taken to eliminate poverty will immediately enhance India's standing in the field of human rights. He added that the government of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has successfully begun to address the problem of poverty in the larger context of provision of human rights. He denounced homelessness, lack of basic amenities and lack of access to healthcare as violations of human rights. He added that after 2014, for the first time, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the government has begun tackling these challenges with great focus. He said that this effort needs to be showcased to the world, and hailed it as the biggest effort globally to protect and promote human rights.

 



 

Remembering the 40,000 victims of terrorism in Kashmir, Shri Shah called terrorism and Naxalism the greatest violations of human rights. While emphasizing on zero tolerance towards custodial deaths and police atrocities; he spoke for the protection of human rights of the victims of terrorism and those who have been unable to enjoy the fruits of development because of the violence inflicted by Naxalism and terrorism.

Shri Shah praised the rich intellectual tradition of India's Constituent Assembly debates, and said that those debates enliven the concept of human rights and the spirit of the Constitution. He said that the various legal provisions to enact the Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights as enshrined in the Constitution, such as  Rigjt To Education, Right To Information and Right To Food are all connected to the advancement of human rights and that the protection and promotion of human rights is a cornerstone of India's Constitutional philosophy. Shri Shah said that the recent Amendment to the Protection of Human Rights Act has expanded the scope of the Act and made it more inclusive in the spirit of Paris Principles. 

Shri Shah expressed pride at NHRC being accorded the status of an International Human Rights Institution and praised the work done by NHRC in various fields associated with human rights. He congratulated NHRC as well as civil society for the steps taken by them to advance the cause of human rights in the last 26 years. Shri Shah said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Government would act as a proactive sentinel of human rights for every citizen, regardless of a law to mandate the same.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah presided over the 14th Annual convention of the Central Information Commission as Chief Guest. Also present was Minister of State for Ministry of Development of North East Region (Independent Charge); Minister of State for the Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension, Departments of Space and Atomic Energy, Dr. Jitendra Singh. 

In his address, Shri Shah expressed pleasure at the functioning of the Right to Information (RTI) Act and said that in the 14 years since its enactment, the purpose and objective of the act has been fulfilled. He added that the main objective of RTI was to increase trust of people in the system of governance, and the act has been successful in instilling and strengthening the faith of the people that the system functions within the boundaries defined by the Constitution. He noted that this trust automatically increases a sense of partnership and ownership of people in governance, and this sense of partnership goes a long way in making the nation progress.

 



 

Shri Shah also said that in 1947, India attained freedom from a long era of oppression where the objective of the administration was discriminatory and was to fulfill the wishes of foreign masters, as opposed to looking after the welfare of people. This objective and the steps taken in that direction caused a disconnect between people and the administration. Shri Shah remarked that till 2005, no steps taken to remove this disconnect had been successful, but in the last 14 years, this gap is being fulfilled by the transparency and accountability ushered in through RTI. He called transparency and accountability the twin pillars of good governance and hailed RTI as a major milestone for good governance.

Shri Shah noted that RTI has channelized and transformed civil society into a force that ensures accountability from the government. He said that while till 1990 only 11 nations had some form of RTI, this number increased with information revolution and globalization, and  this increase has helped advance the cause of good governance globally. He hailed India as the first nation to have successfully created an accountability system till the last leg of governance. He said that India has nearly 5 lakh information officers working to fulfill the writ of RTI at different levels of government, and such a large number of officers working for the cause of transparency and accountability is unseen anywhere else in the world.

Shri Shah praised RTI as a great step to remove injustice and corruption from the system and increase the efficiency of governance. He said that RTI removes arbitrariness from governance and acts as a major grievance redressal tool. He said that the use of high technology methods like video conference and digitization of RTI files makes the lives of litigants easier. 



 

Shri Shah said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the government is committed to creating a system where there is enough suo moto declaration of information that the need to file RTI applications itself is reduced. He said that the success of a transparent government lies not in an increase in the number of RTI applications but in the fact that RTI applications reduce in spite of the RTI process being completely accessible to people.

Shri Shah expounded upon the dichotomy between RTI and Data Protection laws. He noted the importance of proactive, suo moto declaration of information by the government and said that from Mudra to online registrations of FIR, the use of internet has helped infuse transparency in the system. He said that the job of officers dealing with RTI is to create awareness, and that people should know they do not need RTI for many things for which the government proactively declares information.

Shri Shah noted that there has been very little misuse of RTI and said that this shows the maturity of our democracy. He said that awareness regarding transparency should not be limited to quasi-judicial proceedings and disposal of cases but govt servants should instead actively reach out to people to make them aware of the proactive steps taken by government to increase transparency, accountability and efficiency in the government. 

Shri Shah gave the example of the Kedarnath all weather road as a successful attempt to harness technology to increase transparency in government projects. He also mentioned the GeM (Government e-Marketplace) portal where the smallest vendor can be part of govt tendering. He hailed the portal as a major step forward for small industries and reiterated that the government was committed to creating a system where people would not need to use RTI because information would be proactively disclosed and available in public domain. 

Shri Shah advised the officers present that they should increase the sense of responsibility in people, along with awareness about RTI. He said that RTI should not be misused or used for personal enmity or vendetta. He said that the power of RTI brought with it the responsibility to use it carefully. He added that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi was determined to create a system where information was given freely, so that people would not need to resort to RTI.  He added that the government would further ease the process of RTI to take justice and accountability to the last mile. He said that RTI would go a long way in the creation of a welfare state envisaged by the makers of our Constitution, and New India as envisioned by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. 

 



 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the government had further strengthened the cause of transparency and accountability by creating an online portal for RTI, which did not exist previously. He said that the proactive increase in transparency in the last five years has led to a reduction in the need for RTI. He said that in 2019 alone, 12 lakh RTI related grievances had been redressed successfully. He added that the government had taken several steps to increase awareness about RTI but cautioned that the law should not be misused. 

Chief Information Commissioner Shri Sudhir Bhargava remarked that the annual convention offers an opportunity to reflect and introspect on the implementation of RTI Act and the success it has achieved in furthering our shared democratic values.

                On the directions of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) organized a two-day workshop on sensitization of Nodal Officers for disaster management in Central Ministries/Departments, in New Delhi. Around 120 senior level officers attended the workshop. This included representatives of Ministries/Departments of the Central Government, disaster management specialists, technical institutions and premium training institutes including NDMA, National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

 



 

The objectives of this workshop was to sensitize the Nodal Officers on disaster management framework for disaster risk reduction; coherence between Sendai Framework, Sustainable Development Goals and Paris agreement; Global Perspective on Disaster Risk Reduction and preparation of disaster management plans of Ministry/Departments. These plans shall include measures for mitigation, preparedness capacity building and response for effective management of Disasters.

This is an important step towards supporting the initiative for promoting resilient infrastructure systems, which is taken forward as a lead step by India, in form of Collision for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), recently launched by the Prime Minister during the Climate Action Summit at New York. Integrating disaster resilience into all facets of development is also a critical attribute towards the vision of ‘ease of living’ for all, and a 5 trillion economy by 2024. 

In the post 2015 developmental agenda, India has undertaken a series of initiatives and is emerging as a global leader in the field of disaster management. Development and disasters need to go hand in hand and the prime concern be to build disaster resilience for all physical, social, economical and environmental infrastructures, without waiting for a disaster to strike. All Nodal Officers of Ministries/Departments present in the workshop were encouraged to prepare and periodically update their Disaster Management Plan in line with the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) and also to inculcate suitable measures for effective implementing the DM Plan on ground.

With Government’s sustained efforts, significant improvement in the preparedness and response structure of the country to natural calamities has happened. Effective handling of all these disasters is a direct outcome of well coordinated efforts, policy initiatives, enhancement of early warning capabilities, advance preparation, training, capacity development and synergy between and amongst the Central Government Ministries/Departments with their counterparts in State Governments. There is a need to keep up these efforts on a continuous basis for further improvement of disaster risk reduction mechanism in our country. There is also a need of research and development programmes in collaboration with various academic and professional bodies.

Presentations and discussions by the Members and professionals of NDMA, NIDM and practitioners on different dimensions of disaster risk and resilience, tools and strategies, were aimed at enabling the Nodal Officers from various Ministries and Departments to understand the process of developing and implementing their Disaster Management Plans. Issues of climate change adaptation, ecosystem based resilience, housing and structural safety, man-made disasters, governance and financial instruments, participatory approach and integration of disaster management into plans and schemes of the government were discussed.

                An all India conference of State coordinators & Directors of Census Operations for Census of India 2021 & updation of National Population Register (NPR) in the country was held in New Delhi under the chairmanship of Dr. Vivek Joshi, Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India. The event was attended by senior State Government officers & DCO officers.

The aim of the event was to interact with the attending officers to help them understand the preparation for Census 2021 (for both the phases- house listing and population enumeration), eliminate any doubts regarding the same and have an interactive session on suggestions for improvement. To disseminate information on different aspects of Census, presentations were given to the State coordinators & Directors of Census Operations.

The event began with an inaugural address from Dr Joshi & further discussions were carried out on the role of different States for Census 2021, support being provided to the States by the central government and the support expected by the States to run the Census process seamlessly. Senior officials were also explained about logistics involved for carrying out the Census and how dissemination of information will be done to raise awareness on Census.

To elaborate about the Digital methodology to be used in the upcoming Census, presentations were made on Mobile App for Census (HLO, NPR & PE), Census management and monitoring portal. Along with different aspects of Census, discussion was held on updation of National Population Register (NPR) in the country.

Training of National trainers is to start from 14th October, 2019 and the senior State officials were informed about the schedule of the training. Also, it was informed that as the training is to be scaled up from the national level till the enumerators level, the State officials should ensure everyone’s participation. This will help in avoiding gaps in the Census operation.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved Inclusion of 5,300 DP families of Jammu & Kashmir-1947 who initially opted to move outside the State of Jammu & Kashmir but later on returned and settled in the State of Jammu & Kashmir, in the Rehabilitation Package approved by the Cabinet on 30.11.2016 for Displaced Families PoJK and Chhamb under the PM’s Development Package 2015 for Jammu & Kashmir.

Benefits:

The approval will enable such DP Families to become eligible to get one-time financial assistance of Rs 5.5 Lakhs under the existing scheme, and in turn, be able to get some sustained income which the existing scheme is aimed at. 

It is mentioned here that in the wake of the1947 Pakistani aggression in J&K, 31,619 families migrated from Pakistan Occupied Areas of J&K (PoJK) to the state of J&K. Of these, 26,319 families settled in the state of J&K and 5300 families initially opted to move out of the state of J&K to other parts of the country. Further during the Indo-Pak wars of 1965 and 1971 10,065 more families were displaced from ChhambNiabat area. Of these 3,500 families were displaced during the 1965 war and 6565 families were displaced during the 1971 war.

The 36,384 displaced families covered under the package approved by the Cabinet on 30.11.2016 included 26,319 displaced families from PoJK settled in J&K and 10,065 Displaced Families displaced from ChhambNiabat area. The 5300 DP families of PoJK who initially opted to move out of the state of J&K to other parts of the country were not included in the approved package. Now those DP families out of the 5300 who initially opted to move out of the State but later returned and settled in J&K are being included in the package.

Inclusion of those DP Families out of 5,300 DP families of PoJK 1947 who have returned and settled in the State of Jammu & Kashmir in the existing scheme, who have suffered on account of wars and hostilities, will enable them to earn a reasonable monthly income and be part of mainstream economic activities. This will also upgrade the Government’s capacity to respond effectively to such DP families need of financial assistance. Requirement of funds will be met out of the already sanctioned funds for the existing scheme.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah interacted with the probationers of the 2018 batch of the Indian Police Service (IPS) in New Delhi today. 

 

 

 

Addressing the probationers, Shri Shah encouraged them to be proud to be part of a service that is continuously working to ensure safety and security of the people. He said that contrary to the image of police portrayed in popular culture, it is these officers, from top to bottom, who are responsible for maintaining law & order and safeguarding the internal security of the country. He said that there is a need for bringing a positive change in the public perception about police. Shri Shah said that for developing a positive image of police, it is necessary that young probationers focus on discharging their official duties honestly and make positive contribution for the betterment of the society.

Giving his views on reforms in the policing system, Shri Shah said that reforming the system does not mean shunning the traditional ways of policing totally, rather it is a continuous process of adaptation of the old methods to address new challenges.  He noted that the challenges faced by societies change, and so should the responses to them, from laws to technology. The Home Minister said that the government is committed to police reforms and encouraged the probationers to individually carry out small yet important improvements in local police functioning, wherever they were posted. Maintenance of peace and stability is very important to achieve PM, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of a $5 trillion economy, he added.

Shri Shah expounded on the changing role of police and said that the colonial role of police as an agent of fear is not the reality of today. He called for the fear associated with police to be removed by bringing a positive behavioral change in the personnel and added that the IPS as an institution must make this change percolate to the grassroots. He said that in PM’s vision of a ‘New India’, minimum use of force and maximum effectiveness should be the motto of police everywhere and there is a need of human touch and sensitivity in the Police to gain peoples’ trust. 

Shri Shah called for a conceptual change in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and said that the amended code must be in line with India being a Welfare State. He noted that the purpose of the IPC and CrPC has shifted from preservation of the British Empire to the welfare of people, and this has to be reflected in the provisions and application of the code. 

Shri Shah advised the probationers to never run away from responsibility and never compromise with discipline. He said that there are three constituents of constitutional framework of the country - the people, the government and the bureaucracy. The government and the bureaucracy need to perform their roles responsibly in order to effectively implement the Constitution in its letter and spirit. 

 

 

 

Speaking on taking tough yet right decisions, Shri Shah asserted that some bold decisions are necessary to be made for people’s benefit, without getting bogged down by the fear of a backlash. He quoted the example of Jammu and Kashmir and said that not a single bullet had been fired or not a single person had died after the abrogation of Article 370. He also added that only 10 police stations of Kashmir, out of 196, have Section 144 in force. 

Shri Shah further said that Jammu and Kashmir would not remain a Union Territory forever and that the statehood would be returned once situation is normalized. He said that the notion that only the Article 370 protected the Kashmiri culture and identity was a wrong one. He asserted that all regional identities are inherently protected by the Indian Constitution and called the misuse of Article 370 the root cause of cross border terrorism. 

Speaking on the need for a National Register of Citizens (NRC), he asserted that NRC was essential not just for national security but for good governance as well. He said that the NRC must not be seen as a political exercise but a Constitutional one, as it is very important to have a national citizen register in order to ensure that benefits of development reach all our citizens. 

Talking on how the efficiency of working of the police be improved, Shri Shah told the probationers that as IPS officers, their job would be to ensure that there is freedom to take required decisions and owning up of responsibility at all levels, without overstepping of boundaries. He urged the young officers to encourage and inspire their staff and build capacity of constables. He asserted that an organization can only be as strong as its base, and the base of the police system is the constable. 

 

 

 

Speaking on the increasing proportion of women in police at every level, Shri Shah said that lady IPS officers can inspire other women to join the police. He said that gender-based reservation was not the answer to the issue of inadequate representation of women in the police. He spoke of the need to change societal mindset in this regard and expressed confidence that this would gradually happen.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah inaugurated the North East Handloom and Handicraft Exhibition in Aizawl, Mizoram today. Also gracing the occasion were Chief Minister of Mizoram, Shri Zoramthanga and Union Minister of State (IC) for Development of North Eastern Region and Minister of State for Prime Minister's Office, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Departments of Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh.

 



 

Addressing at the event, the Home Minister expressed happiness to visit one of the most beautiful states in India and called it an important representative of Indian Democracy. ""Once affected by insurgency and separatism, today Mizoram stands as a symbol of peace and fraternity and is giving this message to the whole World"", he added.

Shri Shah said that this is the first Handloom and Handicraft Exhibition being organised in the North East. Handloom holds the capability to generate huge employment opportunities in the North East and play an important role in the growth and development of the people, he said.

 



 

Shri Shah observed that India's North East is rich in availability of forest produce and other raw materials for the handloom and handicraft sector. Combining this with the traditional culture of making handicrafts and presence of skilled people, he said, handicrafts can play a pioneering role in the development of the North East.

The Home Minister said that during the first Narendra Modi Government, Bamboo was taken out of the list of trees that were prohibited for felling due to environmental concerns. With this decision, the availability of Bamboo has been increased to facilitate the handicrafts sector by the government. The region that would benefit the most would be the North East, he added.

 



 

Talking about the steps taken under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi to make the North East prosper, Shri Shah said that the PM has worked day and night to initiate whole of the North East on a path of peace and prosperity. In Mizoram, in the last 5 years, a number of developmental projects have been initiated which include 60 MW Tuirial hydro electric power project. The Home Minister also expressed confidence that by 2021, Aizawl would be connected by broadgauge railways. The Kaladan multi modal waterway and establishing of new border hats would bring huge opportunities of trade and commerce to Mizoram. Other initiatives that have been initiated in Aizawl are Greater Aizawl water project, state referral hospital, state sports academy, horticulture colleges and a cricket stadium, he added. 

 



 

Drawing a comparison with the previous government, Shri Shah said that Mizoram received over Rs. 19,970 crores during 13th Finance Commission (FC), whereas, during the 14th FC, over Rs. 42, 970 crores have been spent by the Modi Government for Mizoram's development. He also gave details of progress on various flagship schemes of Goverment of India like LPG connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, houses under PM Awas Yojana, bank accounts opened under PM Jan Dhan yojana, loans given to Mizo youth under PM Mudra yojana, building of national highways, household electrification and construction of toilets in Mizoram. Today, Mizoram is a totally open defecation free state, he noted with pride.

Stressing on the importance the government gives to the development of the North East, Shri Shah said, ""Narendra Modi Government is totally committed to ensure development of Mizoram and to find solutions to all kinds of challenges that the state is facing"". He concluding the address by assuring the Mizoram CM of government of India's full cooperation and assistance in taking the state on the path of swift progress and development.

He has further approved the advance release of 2nd installment of centre’s share of SDRF amounting to Rs.213.75 crore to the State of Bihar for the year 2019-20.

The States of Karnataka and Bihar have apprised of the paucity of funds in the SDRF account, resulting in delay in providing relief assistance to the affected people and requested for release of advance additional financial assistance from NDRF.

The logistics support provided includes adequate number of teams of National Disaster Response Force, Indian Air Force and Coast Guard helicopters, Army columns, Navy & Coast Guard personnel along with necessary rescue equipment.

Government of India supplements the effort of the State Government by providing assistance for relief of immediate nature through SDRF and ,  per established procedure.

Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah flagged off the New Delhi-Katra 'Vande Bharat' Express, in New Delhi today. This is the second ‘Vande Bharat’ express after the New Delhi - Varanasi semi-high speed train flagged off by Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi in February this year. The coaches of this train are indigenously manufactured at the Chennai Rail coach factory.

 



 

Shri Shah congratulated the Ministry of Railways for giving a big gift to the people of the country, in this Navratras. He said that religious tourism has a very important role in the development and progress of Jammu-Kashmir. Every citizen of India has a desire to visit Vaishnodevi Temple at least once in the lifetime. From the day he took charge, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi put forward a vision to connect places of religious interest across the country with a safe, efficient and comfortable high-speed railway network. A number of steps have already been taken by the government to facilitate pilgrims to visit the places of their religious interest. The ‘Vande Bharat’ express is one big step in that direction while keeping in mind speed, scale and service as the prime priority, he said.

 

Shri Shah said that PM visualises Railways as the lifeline to achieve his vision of a $5 trillion economy. ‘Vande Bharat’ is a hallmark of the success of 'Make in India' and the potential that it holds in giving a boost to the economy. This is evident with the speed at which the development and modernisation of railways is taking place under Shri Modi's leadership, he added. Home Minister said, ""Railways must keep this fast paced development profile going on in full steam and achieve Prime Minister's vision of a $5 trillion economy, in the same way as Railways played a major role in the success of Bapu's freedom struggle"".

 



 

Remembering Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th anniversary, Shri Shah said that Bapu gave a philosophy to the world of how to derive simple solutions to the biggest of problems. One such philosophy during the freedom movement was 'Swadeshi' and railways played an integral part in Gandhiji's struggle for freedom by forming a connect with the people of India, he said. Shri Shah expressed pride in saying that this ‘Vande Bharat’ express is totally ‘Swadeshi’ and is at par with the latest rail transport technology across the world. This train is a big tribute that Shri Modi has given to the ideals of Bapu, with his vision of 'Make in India', he added. The Home Minister urged the Railway Minister to chart out the role of Railways in Gandhiji's journey during the freedom struggle, during the 'Gandhi@150' celebrations.

 

Speaking on the removal of Article 370, Shri Shah said that Article 370 was a roadblock in Jammu-Kashmir's development and its true integration with India. He expressed confidence that after its removal, the evil of terrorism would be completely eliminated from Jammu Kashmir. ""I believe that in the next 10 years, Kashmir would be the leading state on development parameters. The beginning has happened with the flagging off of the Vande Bharat express. It is a big gift from PM Modi to the people of J&K by bringing development in the state and giving a boost to religious tourism there "", he said.

 



 

Concluding his address, Shri Shah expressed great satisfaction on the way Railways is getting transformed on the lines of 'Make in India' and making an unprecedented contribution in the growth of the economy.

                Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy launched a single window online system for licensing of eating houses/lodging houses, in New Delhi today. This unique initiative is a joint effort of various agencies involved in the process of licensing in the NCT of Delhi for facilitating ease of doing business.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Reddy said that the portal is a step in the direction to achieve Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision to establish a corruption-free economy by bringing in welfare-oriented economic reforms. He said that India has progressively improved its Ease of Doing Business ranking and the Government is encouraging entrepreneurs to start up new businesses. The Food and Beverages is a big sector and by 2021, it would be having over 2% contribution in India’s GDP, he added.

Talking about the features of the portal, Shri Reddy said that, this single window clearance system has been developed under Digital India programme to facilitate people to obtain licenses to open their eatery/lodging businesses in Delhi. This would be an integrated, transparent and seamless system for providing licenses on a time bound manner. Such a people-friendly system would prevent corruption and increase compliance with rules and regulations by all stakeholders, the Minister said.

The Unified Portal aims at simplifying and rationalizing the regulatory processes (registration & inspection), infusion of transparency and avoids procedural delays in getting statutory clearances from various authorities and real time receipt of application by all agencies simultaneously. 

 

The Single Window Unified Portal will facilitate:


	the applicant to know the status of his application at all the stages of approval process;
	the applicant will get notification of any deficiency in his application in the portal itself and also through email and message in his registered mobile number;
	the applicant may correct the deficiencies online in the portal itself within the prescribed timeline; time bound processing of application by all the agencies; 
	the applicant can download the approval by all agencies from the portal; 
	the portal will also facilitate easy monitoring by concerned authorities. 


 

In NCT of Delhi, a number of licenses are required for running eating houses/ lodging houses. The requirements are as per the provisions in New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) Act 1994, Delhi Municipal Corporation Act 1957, Delhi Fire Service Act 2007, Delhi Police Act, 1978 and the Air/ Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Acts. These Acts mandate the concerned organization to issue license/ NOC/ registration/ consent for operating eating/ lodging houses in Delhi. In other words, this results into handling the matter by respective agencies in compartmental and isolated manner without much consultation with other stakeholders causing complication in some cases at later stages.  

This necessitated the applicants to procure four basic clearances separately– municipal, fire, police and pollution control committee – making the entire process cumbersome, hassle prone and time taking. These difficulties lead to situations where restaurants and hotels operate with just one or two of these clearances, thus, posing a health/safety hazard to public. Therefore, a seamless system where various agencies can co-ordinate their respective inspection and approval processes and provide the public with a single point of hassle-free contact, is required.

In order to address the above without effecting any change in existing legal / regulatory position and mandate given by respective Acts to all concerned agencies, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) facilitated developing a single window online system developed through NIC (MHA), in consultation with all the stakeholders.

                A meeting of the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), chaired by the Cabinet Secretary, Shri Rajiv Gauba, was held today to review the prevailing flood situation in the state of Bihar.

The State Government informed that due to extremely heavy rainfall in the State, alongwith high levels of water in the rivers, there has been flooding in 16 districts.

Extensive evacuation, rescue and relief efforts have been undertaken by the State Government machinery, in which all assistance has been rendered by NDRF and other Central Agencies. Twenty teams of the NDRF have been deployed in the State of which six have been located in Patna, which has witnessed very heavy rains and water logging over the past three days.

Two helicopters of the Air Force are currently deployed in rescue and relief operations. Four heavy duty pumps, made available by the Ministry of Coal are reaching Patna today, which would pump out about 3000 gallons per minute from water logged areas.

Essential supplies of food and drinking water are being supplied by the State Government and current efforts are towards restoration of electricity in flood affected areas.

While, teams from Central Ministries have already carried out assessment of damages in the State, a fresh visit would be made by them to take stock of the current situation.

IMD has stated that while there has been very heavy rainfall in the State over the past few days, the situation is improving now.

Cabinet Secretary took stock of the current situation, preparedness, rescue and relief operations and directed that all assistance, as sought by the state, be provided to meet the crisis.

Senior officials of the Ministries of Home, Defence, Coal and Water Resources, as well as those from NDMA, NDRF, IMD and Central Water Commission attended the meeting. Chief Secretary and other senior officers from the State Government participated in the meeting through Video Conference.

                CPWD has awarded the consultancy work to M/s HCP Design, Planning & Management Pvt. Ltd. on 18.10.2019 and now the firm is on board for development of the Master Plan of Central Vista area and design of buildings as per new requirements.The Govt. has set stringent timelines to complete the development/redevelopment of Parliament building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista.  While the timelines given to CPWD to complete the Central Vista project is November, 2021, the work on Parliament building is to be completed by March, 2022 and the common Central Secretariat by March 2024.  

With an aim of improving the old buildings on Raisina Hills, make improved Common Secretariat Buildings, refurbish old Parliament building, make new space for new requirement of MPs and upgrade the entire Central Vista area by revisiting entire Master Plan, a world class Consultant was required.The process of selection of Consultant was started on 02.09.2019 when a Notice Inviting Bid was issued by CPWD.To meet the objective of selection of a reputed consultant, a system of QCBS (80 : 20) has been adopted.  The sanction towards cost of consultancy has been issued for Rs. 229.75 Cr. As per the RFP, a pre-bid conference meeting was also held on 12.09.2019 where 24 bidders participated. The issues raised in the meeting were addressed.  The Technical Bids were opened on 30.09.2019. A total of six bids were received.  After examining the initial eligibility and technical parameters, all bidders were asked to make their presentation on 11.10.2019 on Approach and Methodology before a Jury consisting of reputed Architects and Landscape Designer under the chairmanship of Prof P.S.N Rao, Director, School of Planning & Architecture(SPA), Delhi and chairman Delhi Urban Art Commission(DUAC). Four Bidders were formally selected for opening of financial bid, which was opened on 12.10.2019.  

 After assigning the weightage of 80% to technical i.e. quality aspect and 20% to financial, M/s HCP Design, Planning & Management Pvt. Ltd. have emerged the highest scores.  They are one of the leading architect firms in India, having vast experience of designing various buildings and spaces like Central Vista and State Secretariat at Gandhinagar; Sabarmati River Front Development, Ahmedabad; Mumbai Port Complex;Redevelopment of Temple Complex, Varanasi; New Campus, IIM Ahmedabad and CII-SN Centre of Excellence Kolkata etc. They have designed some projects outside India also.  After the Master Plan is prepared the steps would be taken to execute the works by CPWD by awarding the works to reputed eligible contractors.

The buildings on Raisina Hills were constructed in the period from 1911 to 1931, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyen and Sir Herbert Baker.  At that time, also these were designed to have office for viceroy & Secretariat.  The Parliament building was constructed in the same period. Various buildings along Rajpath have been constructed at different stages for accommodating offices of various Central Govt. Ministries and Departments. The Central Vista starting from Rashtrapati Bhawan upto India Gate is the heart of city which has been point of attraction for visitors from all over the world.

Over a period of above 100 years after the conceptualisation of building on Raisina Hill and adjoining to Rajpath, the requirement has now increased manifold.  These buildings designed earlier are not now able to provide enough space, amenities and comfort requirement.  The requirement of safety standards have also got improved.  In terms of offices, now more space is required to accommodate all Central Govt. offices at nearby area.  Due to delimitation, more Nos. of MPs may be there in future and hence more space is required for them.  Even for present MPs, the space and amenities required is quite insufficient in Parliament House.Lots of visitors come to Central Vista from India & abroad and there is an imperative need to improve the beauty of Central Vista to make it a world  class tourist attraction point.

                The Union Cabinet approved the Regulations for conferring/ recognizing ownership or mortgage/ transfer rights to residents of Unauthorized Colonies (UCs) in Delhi. The Cabinet further approved bringing a Bill in the next session of Parliament to implement the proposal. 

Major impact & benefit to the People living in Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi:


	The decision will benefit more than 40 lakh residents of unauthorized colonies spread over around 175 sq kms, as development / redevelopment can now take place in these colonies resulting in a clean, secure and healthy living environment.
	This landmark initiative will address major issues being faced by the residents of UCs like lack ownership/transfer rights, provision of basic infrastructure and civic amenities.  
	With recognition of property documents, the property holders in these colonies can now enter into valid property transactions. Besides providing a legitimate claim to the property, the decision will encourage property holders to invest in safe structures, thereby improving the living conditions in these colonies substantially.  
	The decision is applicable to 1,797 identified UCs, which are inhabited by lower income group society.  The decision does not apply to 69 affluent colonies identified by DDA, including Sainik Farms, Mahendru Enclave and Anant Ram Dairy.
	The rights will be conferred on payment of nominal charge based on carpet area/plot size. For colonies on Government land, the charge will be 0.5% (for less than 100 sq m), 1% (for 100 - 250 sqm) and  2.5%  (for greater than 250 sqm), of the circle rate of highest category of locality of the residential area surrounding the UC. 
	For colonies on private land, the charge will be half of the charge on government land. 


 

Details:


	In the ensuing session of the Parliament, the Central Government will introduce a Bill for recognizing General Power of Attorney (GPA), Will, Agreement to Sell, Purchase and possession documents, which will be a one-time relaxation for this purpose for the residents of UCs. 
	The Bill will provide for registration charge & stamp duty on last transaction and also address the issue of income tax liability on account of less than circle rate charges.
	DDA will lay down a simplified procedure for issuing conveyance deed and registration of property.
	Boundaries of the UCs/ clusters of UCs will be delineated by DDA.
	DDA will prepare Local Area Plan (LAP) for all UCs. 
	There will be no Penalty and external development charges (EDC). 
	Multiple plots/flats holders will be charged on the rate applicable to area by clubbing all properties. 
	Residents will have option to pay charge in three equal instalments to be paid in a year.  Any person paying full amount in one instalment will get the ownership rights immediately.  Provisional rights will be given on payment of 02 instalments, which will be converted to permanent rights after full and final payment.
	Late payment to attract simple interest @ 8% pa.
	Conveyance deed will be executed for residential purpose, irrespective of use. 


 

Background:


	As per the existing Regulations of 2008, the entire process of regularization was to be coordinated and supervised by Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, (GNCTD) by giving wide publicity. Delineation of boundary of UC is the starting point of the process as per the Regulations. However, GNCTD could not delineate the boundaries of these colonies even after 11 years of issuance of the Regulations and has sought more time upto 2021 to complete this exercise. 
	People living in these UCs have neither invested in safe structures nor could the Government create any social infrastructure on account of these colonies having developed without approved Layout Plan (LOP). In the absence of basic amenities, the residents of these colonies are living in uninhabitable conditions. Though the Master Plan Delhi-2021 allows for redevelopment of colonies with 50% additional Floor Area Ratio (FAR) as an incentive, no redevelopment has taken place so far as the residents do not have ownership rights.
	In order to confer/ recognize ownership or mortgage/ transfer rights to residents of UCs, a Committee, headed by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, was constituted, with approval of the Union Cabinet, to recommend the process for conferment/recognition of rights of ownership or transfer/mortgage of property and thereby create an opportunity for redevelopment of such areas in a planned manner. 
	Based on the recommendations of the Committee and elaborate consultations with all stakeholders the above proposals to notify revised Regulations and introduce a Bill in the Parliament have been finalised.

                “Our government in June 2019 directed all Ministries/ Departments to take up and implement on the ground within the next 100 days of various public welfare/ development activities. We are strongly committed to improve the quality of life of citizens.” said Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State(I/c)  for Housing & Urban Affairs launching the mobile app, “mHariyali,”, here today. The app is aimed to encourage Public engagement in  planting  trees and other such Green drives. People can now upload information/photos of any plantation done by them, which is linked to app and will be displayed on the website www.epgc.gov.in.  The App provides for automatic geo-tagging of plants. This app will also enable nodal officers to periodically monitor the plantation. The App is user friendly and works on any android mobile phone. 

Earlier this month, as  part of activities to promote ease of living, the Directorate of Estates, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs carried out the following activities in 103 selected government colonies (76 in Delhi and 29 in other States) through public/stakeholders participation:


	Cleaning and greening of open space through plantation 
	Rain Water Harvesting – Awareness and construction 
	 Sensitization on Source Segregation of Household waste and Orientaion and Capacity building on Home composting 


For each colony, the above activities were taken up in a campaign mode over 100 days from 15.7.2019 to 15.10.2019 and will continue, Nodal Officers were appointed from the Directorate, CPWD and ULBs to liaison with Resident Welfare Association to ensure  maximum public participation.               

A mass plantation drive “Haryali Mahotsav” was launched in San Martin Park, Chanakyapuri on 28.7.2019 by Secretary HUA in which approx 500 plants were planted and about 150 people, including students, participated. To date, 21,756 plants, including fruit plants have planted in these 103 colonies and more than 3800 people have participated.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State(I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs has urged the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to effectively manage solid waste by creating a dedicated group of officers and skilled municipal staff, through adequate training, hands on experience and new technologies.  Stating that the Government of India’s efforts towards transforming waste to wealth is also reflected in the Waste to Wealth Mission project which has been approved under the recently constituted Prime Minister’s Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council(PM-STIAC), Shri Puri stated that the objective of the Mission is to identify, develop and deploy existing and new technologies to treat waste to generate energy, recycle materials and extract resources of value so as to create a clean and green environment. He was speaking at World Habitat Day 2019 celebration here today.  Shri DurgaShanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA, Shri Shiv Das Meena, Additional Secretary, MoHUA, Shri Ravi Kant, CMD, HUDCO, senior Ministry officials, School Children and Teachers were also present at the function.

            



 

The Mission will assist and augment the Swachh Bharat Mission and Smart City projects by leveraging science, technology and innovation to create circular economic models that are financially viable for waste management to streamline waste management in the country, he added. The minister also said that his ministry was already progressing in the direction of affordable housing in conformity with basic standards of environmental protection.

The event also saw release of publications like the Journal ‘Shelter’ of HUDCO and special issue of NCHF on World Habitat Day. Winners of Painting competition organized in Schools by HUDCO, BMTPC and NHB were felicitated. 

                



 

Earlier the Minister complimented the UN-Habitat for choosing ‘Frontier Technologies as an innovative tool for transforming Waste to Wealth’ as the theme of this year’s World Habitat Day, thereby calling attention to the issue of waste, wishing to change the discourse into a positive one, where waste is presented as an opportunity to bring about wealth and change in the communities and cities where we live.  This year’s theme also assumes much more significance in the light of focus of every nation to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as the Habitat III ‘New Urban Agenda’ (NUA) which put special emphasis on sustainable waste management. Goal 11  of SDGs which talks about ‘making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’, targets that “by 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management”. He reaffirmed that India was committed to achieving the SDGs before time. Frontier technologies—from DNA sequencing to 3D-printing, from renewable energy technologies to biodegradable plastics, from biofuel technologies to digital & nanotechnologies, from machine learning to artificial intelligence—present immense potential for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in general and transforming waste to wealth in particular.  

Speaking at the event, Shri DurgaShanker Mishra, Secretary, MoH&UA said the people’s movement against Single Use Plastic has picked up, as people are now more conscious towards protecting the Environment and securing the habitat for the future generations.

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs, Civil Aviation launched the Swachhata Hi Seva India Plog Run at Rajpath Lawn, India Gate to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation- MAHATMA GANDHI. The event was aimed to spread awareness on the harmful effects of plastic waste and enlist the support of citizens to eliminate single use plastic (SUP).  Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA, Shri Vijay Kumar Dev, Chief Secretary, Government of NCT, New Delhi, Shri Prabhakar Singh, Director General, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) and other senior officials from NDMC and MoH&UA were also present at the event.



Administering ‘Swachhata Hi Seva’  pledge and pledge against use of disposable plastic, Shri Puri said, “Today, on the fifth anniversary of the Swachh Bharat Mission and the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma, I congratulate everyone on having achieved the dream of an open defection free India (except 52 ULBs of West Bengal). This has been possible with the participation of the biggest stakeholders of the movement- the citizens of this country. We are committed to the Prime Minister’s vision of a SUP free India.  With the launch of the India Plog Run, I am confident that the day is not far when India will be free from SUP.” 



Shri Durga Shanker Mishra added, “Citizens across the country have been participating wholeheartedly in Swachhata Hi Seva launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 11 September, 2019. We have already had over 55,000 events conducted by citizens across urban India with participation of around 2 crore people. The Ministry has been taking several initiatives on plastic waste management and promoting its reuse and recycle. The movement against SUP has gained tremendous traction in just a few days. This is the beginning of a new Jan Andolan”. 

                        

Enumerating the various initiatives taken up by CPWD as its contribution towards national efforts towards clean & green and sustainable development, Shri Prabhakar Singh, DG, CPWD, said “As part of collective efforts to reduce Plastic Footprint we have launched the ‘Say ‘no’ to Single-Use-Plastic’ Campaign generating awareness on refuse-reduce-reuse-and-recycle of plastic in GPRA colonies apart from undertaking intense cleaning & greening drive.” 



The Minister also launched the Delhi Cyclists Plog Run. A video that showcased the “SBM Toilets on Google Maps” initiative that allows users to locate the nearest public toilet was also launched on the occasion. Till now, a total of 57,000 public toilets have been made live on Google Maps across 2,300 cities with the number set to increase in the coming days. 

The India Plog Run is also being held in 50 cities across India by United Way of India and Go Native with active support from the Ministry. The plogging drive at India Gate covered a 3 kilometre stretch around India Gate. 

Plogging is a combination of jogging with picking up litter and had first begun in Sweden in 2016 following increased concerns around plastic pollution. Today, plogging has become a popular activity with several plogging drives being organized in India by citizen groups, Urban Local Bodies, etc and is in convergence with the Fit India Movement. The event had other attractions for participants such as a women run cloth bag counter where visitors could get eco-friendly bags stitched from old clothes and a series of street plays on the issue of SUP.

                International workshop on Environmental Flows Assessment and Implementation for India was inaugurated by Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Union Minister for Jal Shakti at Delhi. The exchange of Indian, European and International Experiences was brought together by National Mission of Clean Ganga (NMCG) along with the Indo-German Cooperation with its project “Support to Ganga Rejuvenation” (SGR). Hon’ble Minister also formally released the first version of the Guidance Document on Environment flow assessment in India. The deliberations in this workshop and further research work would help in coming up with advanced version of this e-flow guidance document in future.

It is already accepted around the globe, that the demand for water is increasing due to population growth, rapid urbanization and industrialization and that rivers are a critical natural resource, crucial for human well-being. The Ganga River, for example, supports a population of more than 400 million people by providing a multitude of domestic, agricultural, industrial, and power generation uses, and it also serves for recreational, livelihood and spiritual purposes.

The Ganga provides a unique ecosystem, which is home to India’s National Aquatic animal the Gangetic Dolphin, as well as Gharials, turtles and several birds and other wild animals.  Other rivers like Godavari, Krishna, Mahanadi etc. are also crucial ecosystems and sources for ecosystem services for us and we need to protect these towards sustainability and equitable water use.

Given the current scenario, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said that, “We are committed to protect these lifelines for our future generations.  We have the identified aim of Aviral and Nirmal Dhara- continuous and clean flows as our tribute to Mother Ganga and we intend to extend this to all other rivers in the country.” He added further that, “Maintaining Environmental-Flows in rivers is very important not only for the country but worldwide since water has become a global challenge. We have to come together and act together to tackle this global challenge.” 

“Under the Namami Gange programme, we have been quite serious about maintaining the continuous flow of Ganga. Last year, we recognized the minimum river flow to be maintained and also notified. We have started monitoring for its implementation as well.

We have made a beginning, but there’s a lot to learn from experiences of other countries where this has developed over a period of time” added Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, DG, NMCG. The international workshop aims to assist in the e-flows implementation in India by answering the following questions:

1. What are the overall aims and targets for e-flows assessment in India?

2. What are the short- and long-term steps to implement e-flows according to the overall aims and targets.

In India, the European Union through the India-EU Water Partnership (IEWP) as well as the Indo-German Cooperation with its project “Support to Ganga Rejuvenation” (SGR) in order to promote cooperation in the water sector, has brought together stakeholders, such as governmental institutions, businesses and the civil society. Currently, a guidance document on the “Assessment of Environmental Flows in India” is being developed as part of the IEWP Action Plan and the draft version was launched during the workshop by the Hon’ble Minister Jal Shakti. 

 

 It is increasingly recognized that the goal of attaining healthy river ecosystems can best and most sustainably be reached by integrated environmental management. The workshop includes discussions on Environmental Flows assessment and Implementation for sustainable river basin management, and various aspects of E-Flows in depth. Relevant Indian implementers and stakeholders along with national experts and International experts including those from Germany, Austria, United Kingdom, Bhutan, Poland, The Netherlands and South Africa are present during the workshop. “We will learn from their vast experience

and will also learn from the national experts present regarding the different scenarios within India”, emphasized Mr. Mishra, DG, NMCG. 

In order to advance the successful e-flows implementation in India, this workshop aims to bring Indian, European and international experiences together. A rich variety of cutting-  edge topics and expert speakers from various backgrounds serve to promote challenges and solutions regarding e-flows assessment and implementation.

                An opinion piece titled “Modi Govt’s Swachh Bharat achieved one thing. And it’s not open defecation free India: Survey” by Diane Coffey and Dean Spears (Executive Directors, r.i.c.e.)was published yesterday by The Print. Similar stories have been attempted multiple times by the authors, making misleading and outrageous statements with reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission based on incomplete, flawed, incorrect and - more often than not - non-existent data.

It may be noted that over the past 70 years, since Indian Independence, sanitation levels have been more or less stagnant across rural India,adversely impacting the life conditions of our people. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to take on the challenge of open defecation head on and gave the programme the highest level of political leadership,  the Swachh Bharat Mission became a people’s movement and the rural sanitation situation across the country was  successfullyturned around in a period of five years. Unfortunately, theseperennial critics have not been able to bring themselves to acknowledge these gains and,true to  their habit of perpetuating theoretical critique, have always looked at the glass not just half, but fully empty. They have been trying  to raise false doubts instead of providing solutions, and accepting, as the world has done, the overall success of the Swachh Bharat Mission.

The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation would like to place on record its response to the claims made in the piece about the progress made under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) and its position with respect to the lack of academic integrity shown  by the authors in their attempt to mislead readers with biased and baseless statements.

On independent surveys

The r.i.c.e. piece outrightly dismisses the results of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) based on the “thousands” of households the team surveyed to track changes between 2014 and 2018. The facts are that their statistically insignificant and non-representative study surveyed a sample of merely 1558 households in 120 villages. Further, the study was rife with gaps in methodology and bias of the surveyors, which is evident in the questionnaire design itself. These gaps have been highlighted by this Department in detail through a media statement published on the PIB website, dated 9 January 2019. (link: https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1559229)

The r.i.c.e. piece deliberately ignores the nationwide 90,240 household survey, the National Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) 2018-19, conducted across over 6,000 villages, since that would not serve their explicitly biased conclusions. It is relevant to mention here, given the questions raised about the  credibility of progress figures, that the methodology and processes of NARSS have been developed and approved by an empowered and independent Expert Working Group (EWG) comprising leading experts on statistics and sanitation which include Prof. Amitabh Kundu, Dr N. C Saxena, World Bank, UNICEF, BMGF, Water Aid India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), among others.

The NARSS 2018-19 is the largest and  most representative independent sanitation survey in the country to date. The survey found toilet usage in rural India to be 96.5%. Two more independent surveys conducted in the past by the Quality Council of India in 2017, and National Sample Survey Organization in 2016, also found the usage of rural toilets to be 91% and 95% respectively.

On the “subsidy” INR 12,000 not being enough

This shows the deliberate misunderstanding of the programme by the authors. The INR 12,000 given to the eligible households is not a “subsidy”, but an incentive. Households are encouraged to invest, as is comfortable and convenient for them, for building the toilets of their choice. Having said that, the incentive amount is enough for building a twin pit toilet, the most suitable toilet technology for large parts of rural India. Suffice it to say that they make no reference of the fact that the toilet incentive given by the previous government was significantly less than that given under the SBM.

On targets and the construction of toilets leading to negative consequences

The piece itself admits that  ‘no evidence can settle whether a complex, multi-faced national programme was a cause of such a crime. Moreover, of course, many who worked for a Swachh Bharat (clean India) are dismayed by this killing’, but the authors, undeterred by this lack of evidence, carry on to make irresponsible statements on the subject nonetheless.

Further, in their weak attempt to denounce the SBM, the authors conveniently overlookthe positive impact the SBM has demonstrated in the lives of people in terms of health, economics and the environment, as articulated by global agencies. Some of these are as follows:


	In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that SBM(G) will result in averting more than 3,00,000 deaths (diarrhoea and protein-energy malnutrition) between 2014 and October 2019. 
	UNICEF’s assessment of the economic impact of the SBM estimated that in an ODF village in India, each family saves up to Rs.50,000 per year on account of avoided medical costs, time savings which can be used more productively, and lives saved. 
	UNICEF’s assessment of SBM on Faecal Contamination of Water, Soil, and Food found that ODF villages are 11.25 times less likely to have their groundwater sources contaminated, and 12.7 times less from contaminants traceable to humans alone. 


Onfield officials being directed to “humiliate and harass” 

The SBM(G) recognises the influential role of the community itself to enhance positive behaviour change communication. However, the accusation that swachhagrahis (village volunteers) and nigrani samitis (community groups for monitoring) are actively encouraged ‘to humiliate and harass the poor and marginalised’ only confirms the baseless and evidence-less agenda of the authors.

The Swachh Bharat Mission strongly supports positive behaviour change and the Department takes note of any coercion in implementation very seriously (advisory:https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1559229)The article fails to distinguish between coercion and affirmative community action, such as that led by local Nigrani Samitis, or local GP, which reflects the limited understanding of the community approach to sanitation among the authors.

As opposed to the negative  tone of the r.i.c.e. piece, the Community Approach to Sanitation, employed by the SBM(G), actually brings all sections of the community  together in their effort to eliminate open defecation and practice safe sanitation.

Further, all guidelines and directions of the SBM(G) promote positive behaviour change communication.In 2019, Dr.Cass Sunstein, a Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard who specialises in the ‘nudge theory’, cited the Swachh Bharat Mission as an example for how positive behaviour change can catalyse structural reform(article:https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/nudge-can-help-tackle-india-s-social-problems/story-S1HbFzeiA6T8XVh9l5VLqO.html) . A recent article by Prof Bibek Debroy, as well, confirms the impactful yet sustainable policy outcomes by applying behavioural tools in mission like ‘Swachh Bharat’(article: https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/swachh-bharat-shows-how-to-nudge-the-right-way/1733445/).

Given the glaring gaps in the aforementioned piece, the Department would like to stress that reports based on such erroneous, inconsistent and biased studies are an attempt  to mislead readers.

The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation urges all media houses to practice caution when citing these authors. It is clear that the authors and the study hold a prejudiced and biased perspective on what is widely acknowledged to be a successful Mission and the largest behaviour change programme in the world – reaffirmed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which honoured the Prime Minister with the Global Goalkeeper Award this year for the Swachh Bharat Mission.

                The ‘Ganga Aamantran Abhiyan’ is a pioneering and historic exploratory open-water rafting and kayaking expedition on the Ganga River to be held between 10th October 2019 to 11 November 2019. Starting at Devprayag and culminating at Ganga Sagar, the expedition will cover the entire streatch of over 2500 kms of the Ganga River.

This is the first ever effort by National Mission for Clean Ganga to raft across the entire stretch of the river and also the longest ever social campaign undertaken through an adventure sporting activity to spread the message of River Rejuvenation and Water Conservation on a massive scale. The expedition will draw attention to the ecological challenges being faced by Ganga.

The expedition will encompass the five Ganga basin states including Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal with stops at Rishikesh, Haridwar, Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna, Sonepur and Kolkata. 

A nine-member team of swimmer and rafters from the three Services of the Indian Armed Forces, led by acclaimed international open-water swimmer Wg Cdr Paramvir Singh is being launched in New Delhi by Union Minister of Jal Shakti, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on 7th October 2019. This nine-member team would be joined by 3 members from NDRF, 2 members each from WII and CSIR-IITR.

The team, during the expedition will take up public awareness campaign on the locations at which they will stop. They will organise mass cleaning drives, interact with students of the village/city and will further the message of river conservation.

Apart from the awareness campaign, the team from CSIR–Indian Institute of Toxicology Research will collect water samples from across diverse ranges of the river for the purpose of water testing, while members of the Wildlife Institute of India will undertake flora and fauna census for the year 2019.

The Expedition would comprise of members primarily from the Indian Armed Forces. The Armed Forces is supporting this expedition extensively by way of involving all the Commands & Units on the Ganga stretch and also the members from the Armed Forces Wives Welfare Association all along the Ganga Basin.

The Minister of Jal Shakti, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat will lead from the front and will not only flag-off the expedition but also be a part of the expedition from Devprayag to Rishikesh. 

The expedition is led by Wing Commander Paramvir Singh from Indian Air Force, who is the only person to have swum the entire length of Ganga from Devprayag to Gangasagar in 2015. A distinguished adventure sports enthusiast, he holds 13 World, 3 Asian and 7 National Records. 

The team includes Squadron Leader Dipti B Koshthi, who is a Jaguar aircraft pilot and certified open Scuba Diver, trekker and Para Jumper; Sergeant Johny Vj who is an Aqua Parasailing Instructor, certified open Scuba Diver and mountaineer; Sergeant Srihari Sarripilli who is a distinguished adventure sports enthusiast; Corporal Amrendra Vats who is a non-commissioned officer working as Medical Assistant with great experience in handling medical emergencies during adventure sports.

The team also comprises of non-commissioned officers including Corporal Vicky Tokas who has multiple records in the field of swimming, PO Bikesh Kumar who is a Sailor in the Indian Air Navy, and was a part of the expedition Swimming & Rafting down the entire length of the river Ganga from Devprayag to Gangasagar in 2015; Havaldar Rajesh Kumar and Havaldar Devendra Singh of Indian Army who are adventure sports enthusiasts.

The expedition will commence on 10th October 2019, at Devprayag, where Bhagirathi and Alaknanda merge and the Ganga begins. The expedition will continue for 33 days, through Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal and culminate on 11th November 2019 at Bakkhali Beach, Frazerganj covering a total distance of almost 2,500 kms.

They would be carrying out various awareness exercises along the expedition such as


	Bal Ganga Mela, painting and slogan competition on the theme of water conservation and Ganga rejuvenation
	Interaction with colleges & universities by NMCG officials
	Educating students/youth on water footprint, wetlands and biodiversity conservation
	Test the water campaign by IITR, water testing kits
	Celebrating festivals during the expedition
	Exclusive tie-up with Rotary International for public outreach within community and schools
	Public outreach by WII, IITR, GIZ, Ganga Praharis, IAF, Army, Ganga Vichar Manch during the expedition


Addressing the gathering on the occasion the Hon’ble Minister Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said that “During the last 5 years under the able leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the government has carried out various initiatives in order to restore Ganga’s Aviralta and Nirmalta and it has started to show positive results but any such movement that needs sustainability cannot be achieved until and unless it becomes a public movement or Jan Andolan. In order to connect with the various stakeholders directly or indirectly connected to Ganga, this mega event is being organized.’’

The expedition will be supported by all the stakeholders of Namami Gange including the MPs of the constituency along Ganga, members of Ganga Praharis, Ganga Vichar Manch among others. The expedition is aimed to reach millions of people on Ganga Basin and would be the largest social outreach through an adventure sporting event ever.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, dedicated a Swachh Bharat India to the people of India and the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi on 2 October, 2019.

Addressing 20,000 Swachhagrahis and Sarpanches assembled from all over the country at a massive public event at the Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, the Prime Minister said that the number of people practicing open defecation in India has gone down from 600 million in 2014, to negligible today, through an intensive behaviour change programme under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). He said that by alleviating 60% of the world’s share of people defecating in the open, India has significantly contributed to the global achievement of SDG 6.

He said that a Clean and Open Defecation Free (ODF) India on 2nd October 2019 was the most befitting tribute possible to give to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. He saluted the work done by lakhs of Swachhagrahis in response to the Mission's clarion call for making Swachhata a jan andolan, a people’s movement and physically bowed to the gathering to express his gratitude. 

The Prime Minister said that it was symbolic that the event was happening at Sabarmati Riverfront because it was at Sabarmati Ashram that Bapu gave life to both, the Satyagraha and the Swachhagraha. In that sense, he said that the success of Swachhagraha was history repeating itself, much like the success of Satyagraha as both were based on the tenets of people's participation.

The Prime Minister underscored that the accomplishment was just a step in the direction of Swachh Bharat, which will be a continuous process with focus on sustaining the gains made so far and ensuring that no one is left behind. He said that the Jal Jeevan Mission would be an important step in that direction, sharing that the government has decided to allocate Rs 3.5 lakh crores on it. He added that the people of India need to work together to curb the use of single use plastic.

The Prime Minister shared that the entire international community is now looking at India's example as a successful case study in Sanitation. He added that the Global Goalkeepers Award given to India by the Gates Foundation has put India firmly on the global map as a world leader in the domain of Sanitation.

During his welcome address on the occasion, Shri Vijay Rupani, Chief Minister of Gujarat, lauded the commitment shown by the Prime Minister to the cause of Swachhata and the leadership lent by the government to the rollout of the Mission across the country. He spoke about the positive impact the success of the Mission will have on public health, safety and dignity, setting an example for the world to emulate.

Since the inception of the program, the rural sanitation coverage of India has increased tremendously, from 39% in October 2014 to 100% in September 2019. Over 10 million household toilets have been constructed under the Mission. As a result, 35 States/Union Territories, 699 districts, and 599,963 villages have declared themselves as free from open defecation. 

On the occasion, over 20,000 Sarpanches (village heads) and Swachhagrahis (village motivators) congregated in Gujarat. In the two days prior to the main event (30th Sep – 1st Oct), 20,000 participants joined the ‘Gandhi Trail’ and visited the Statue of Unity and the Dandi Salt Satyagraha Memorial in Gujarat, along with field visits to witness the State’s best practices in the water and sanitation sector. 

Before addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister walked through the Swachh Bharat exhibition, launched the Swachhata Anthem and a Swachh Bharat laser film. He also released commemorative postal stamps and coins on the occasion of Bapu's 150th birth anniversary and gave eleven Swachh Bharat awards for exceptional contribution to the Mission.

                Minister of State for Labour and Employment Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar said that ‘Labour’ comes under Concurrent list and Central and State Governments makes coordinated efforts for welfare of workers. He was addressing Regional Labour Conference in Bhubaneswar today. Labour Ministers and senior officials of six states Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Andaman & Nikobar along with senior officials of Labour Ministry participated in the conference. Regional Conferences help in creating better coordination between Central and State Governments. Central Labour Laws are framed by Central Government but States implement them and bring changes in them keeping in view their special geographical and demographic situation after consultation with the centre. He said that any law can attains it’s goal by proper implementation and it is the State Governments which are implementing them on ground. 

 

Shri Gangwar said that recently Government of India has taken many steps for the welfare of workforce of the country. Code on Wages has been passed by Parliament in August this year and now State Governments should frame rules regarding Code on Wages, fix minimum wages and organize awareness campaign so that maximum number of unorganized sector workers may be benefitted.

 

Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions has been sent to Parliamentary Standing Committee after being introduced in the Lok Sabha. This is also an important legislation which subsumes 13 Central labour laws and covers health, security and working conditions issues of the workers. 

 

Apart from simplifications of Labour laws, Government of India has launched Pension Scheme for unorganized sector workers and small traders and self employed persons. Approximately 33 lakh unorganized sector workers have associated themselves for Pension Scheme. But, to link around 40 crore unorganized sector workers to the scheme, coordination from all the State Governments is essential.

 

He further said that we are using information technology to improve services of EPFO and ESIC and bring more transparency and accountability in them. He expressed hope that this conference will be successful in creating better coordination with State Governments.

                Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) and Goa Government and have joined hands with an aim to generate employment opportunities in Goa. The Chief Minister of Goa along with the KVIC Chairman recently distributed electric potter wheels to 160 families and new models Charkhas (spinning wheels) to 50 trained women. This will create direct employment to 700 people. KVIC is also establishing a Lijjat Papad unit in Goa, which will create 200 direct jobs to the local women. It may be noted that these initiatives are first of its kind in Goa because there was no spinning and weaving activity, no Lijjat Papad unit in Goa earlier. Further for the first time electric potter wheels have been given to replace the traditional potter wheel which was highly labour intensive and less efficient in terms of production. KVIC has already helped 1,000 people to get employment with these initiatives. 

Known for its picturesque beaches, natural landscapes and also as one of the preferred destinations of both national and international tourists, KVIC in a short span of two months, identified beneficiaries from various villages such as Morjim, Old Goa, Panjim, Bicholim, Sakhali, Mappasa, Dabhal and Madgaon and organized trainings in pottery, bee keeping, spinning and Papad making. The move will assist the locals and help in creation of jobs. Chairman KVIC Mr. Saxena said that KVIC will create 10,000 new jobs in the current financial year in Goa. Chief Minister Mr. Sawant expressed his happiness and thanked KVIC for taking these unique initiatives for creating job opportunities to the local people in a record time.

KVIC also participated in the vibrant Goa event as partner and put up 30 stalls to showcase various Khadi and Village Industries products from across the country. In the three days event a record sale of Rs. 60 Lakhs was reported.

                The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has bagged an order worth Rs. 5.88 crore from the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL), in the form of Khadi gift coupons for its 23,504 employees. GAIL agreed to gift Khadi coupons of Rs 2,500 to each of its 23,504 employees in all its units across the nation. The employees, however, would be able to purchase Khadi and products of Village Industries worth Rs. 3,250 from the coupon of Rs. 2,500. The coupons could be redeemed throughout the year at all Departmental Sales Outlets of KVIC. To give easy access to the employees of GAIL to redeem their coupons, KVIC will organize 3 special exhibitions also, at Pata, District Etawah, Vijaypur, District Guna and Jhabua, in Madhya Pradesh where the GAIL have their maximum employees. The MOU has been signed between KVIC and GAIL on 10th October 2019. KVIC will deliver the coupon this week.

KVIC Chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena said that such huge orders from government and PSUs not only increase the income of the artisans but also inspires new entrepreneurs to associate with Khadi with better job avenues. He said that Orders in recent past from GAIL, ONGC, REC, IOC, MRPL, OIL, JK Cement and BEE have been implemental in making a compounding effect on the livelihood of Khadi artisans and have been creating more jobs by adding thousands of new artisans in KVIC’s kitty.

It may be noted that KVIC for the first time launched gift coupon scheme in 2017 and till date gift coupons of face value worth Rs. 89.29 Crores have been sold which is a record in itself and also an indication that the people have started adopting Khadi in place of other international brands.

Earlier this year, KVIC has bagged order worth over Rs. 7.03 crore from the Oil India Limited (OIL), in the form of Khadi gift coupons for its 14,064 employees and from Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) worth Rs. 80 Lakhs for its 800 employees.

                Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Road Transport & Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari launched new KVIC products and a special sales campaign in New Delhi today, on the eve of 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He launched a bamboo bottle of 700ml to 900 ml capacity made by a Tripura based organization, which is being seen as the perfect replacement of plastic bottles as it is natural, cost effective, attractive and most eco-friendly. He also launched low priced sanitary napkins developed by Ladlee, a new soap and kachchi ghani mustard oil. 

Remembering the Father of the Nation on the eve of his 150th birthday, Shri Gadkari said that khadi and village industries were very close to Gandhi ji’s heart. He said Gandhian economics emphasizes on maximum production with involvement of maximum number of people, and the Government of India is sincerely working to fulfil his dreams. The decision to serve tea in kulhads on 400 railway stations, distribution of tool kits to leather artisans are all steps in this direction, he said. The Minister also emphasized the need to modernise Khadi products to make them more attractive to the youth, and said the Ministry and KVIC are collaborating with reputed designers in this regard. Shri Gadkari said that presently 200 MSME companies are listed in National Stock Exchange and KVIC should also make efforts to list some entrepreneurs in NSE which will make easier the credit flow.

Shri Gadkari appreciated the efforts made by KVIC in developing new products which are eco-friendly, cost effective and good for health and environment. He expressed hope that this year KVIC will break its own record of single day sale of Rs. 1.25 Crores which happened on 13th October 2018.

KVIC chairman Shri Vinai Saxena said KVIC is in the process of reviving village industries. The Kacchi Ghani mustered oil launched today is being supplied by a Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) unit established recently near Jaipur. The cost effective sanitary napkins are manufactured in Chandigarh also by a PMEGP Unit. He informed that the annual turnover of KVIC is approximately Rs. 3,000 crores and they are pushing to take it to Rs 5000 crores in the coming years.

In observance of 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi, KVIC, for the first time, is giving 40% discount on Gandhi Topi and Gandhi Dhoti and 20% discount on all village industries products which will be applicable from 2nd October for 40 days.

At the United Nations Climate Action Summit 2019, Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi pledged to increase renewable energy capacity to 175 GW by 2022 and committed for further increasing it to 450 GW.  Today, India stands among the top five countries of the world in terms of solar energy capacity and total renewable energy capacity.   Facilitation for procurement of power through transparent tariff based competitive bidding has led to a remarkable reduction in cost of solar and wind power.  With over 82 GW renewable capacity on ground and about 70 GW at different stage of fruition.  India is well on the way to realize the ambitious target of 175 GW by 2022.  India is making all efforts to ensure that ISA through  its focused vision and action oriented approach will succeed in addressing the biggest challenges confronting  humanity -  sustainable energy, energy poverty and climate change. 

Brune Poirson, the Co-President ISA and the French minister for ecological and inclusive transition thanked India for its leadership in the field of solar energy. She also talked about the ISA objectives which included lowering the cost of energy, increasing investment in the renewable energy, and training and sharing of knowledge and technological knowhow among the member countries.

BACKGROUND

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy hosted the second Assembly of International Solar Alliance (ISA) on 30 and 31 October 2019 New Delhi. While on 30 October 2019, coordination and consultation meetings on different aspects of ISA programmes and initiatives will be held, the Assembly met today.

1.The Assembly is the supreme decision making body of the ISA, and gives directions on various administrative, financial and programme related issues. Shri R.K. Singh, Minister for New and Renewable Energy and Power is President of the ISA Assembly and Ms Brune Poirson, Minister of State for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition Govt. of France, is the Co-President of the Assembly. 

2. Earlier 81 countries of the 121 prospective member countries have signed the Framework Agreement of the ISA. Of these, 58 countries have ratified the same. The Assembly was attended by the Ministers and delegates from member States, Observer States, ISA Partners, and other invitees. Over 400 delegates are expected to participate in the Assembly. 

3.The first Assembly of the ISA was attended by 78 countries, and they had affirmed their determination to accelerate the deployment of solar energy worldwide for achieving universal energy access at affordable rates.Recognizing that ISA has a major role in achieving Sustainable Development Goals, and objectives of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and that the ISA initiative would benefit the world at large, during the first Assembly of the ISA an Indian resolution to extend the Membership of the organisation to all countries that are Members of the United Nations was adopted.

4.Since the first Assembly on 3 October 2018, ISA has initiated many activities and programmes. Demand for over 1000 MW solar power and 300000 solar water pumps has been aggregated from ISA member countries. Some of the major activities for building domestic capacity of the ISA member countries include ITEC Master Trainers Programme at NISE Gurugram; M. Tech programme for mid-career professionals at IIT, Delhi; STAR-C programme, and development of the INFOPEDIA. In order to understand the challenges and issues ‘on the ground’ and to strengthen support for ISA programmes, the ISA sent country missions to eight countries over the course of 2019 – to Benin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Togo, and Uganda. ISA has significantly extended outreach and have partnered with over 40 organizations. These broadly include UN, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), international and regional organizations and foundations, and private sector players.

5. India has been providing all out support for realizing ISA’s vision and objectives. The Government of India has allotted 5 acres of land to the ISA in National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) campus, Gurugram and has released a sum of Rs. 160 crore, i.e. US$ 26 million for creating a corpus fund, building infrastructure and meeting day to day recurring expenditure of the ISA up to the year 2012-22. As per commitment, India will release additional Rs. 15 crore, i.e. US$ 2.1 million in the year 2020-21. In addition, various Public Sector Enterprises of Government of India have contributed US$ 8 million for augmenting ISA corpus fund. Apart from these, India has set aside US$ 2 Billion for solar projects in Africa out of Government of India's US$10 Billion concessional Line of Credit (LOC) for Africa. Exim Bank of India is implementing this line of credit in close coordination with ISA countries in Africa. On the 24th September 2019, on the side-lines of the 74th UN General Assembly, India announced allocation of US$ 12 million grant, and a concessional LOC of US$ 150 Million for Pacific Islands Developing States for undertaking solar, renewable energy and climate related projects.

6.The ISA, is an Indian initiative that was launchedby the Prime Minister of India and the President of France on 30 November 2015 at Paris, France on the side-lines of the COP-21, with 121 solar resource rich countries lying fully or partially between the tropic of Cancer and tropic of Capricorn as prospective members. The overarching objective of the ISA is to collectively address key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy in ISA member countries. It also aims to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology, mobilize investments needed for massive deployment of solar energy, and pave the way for future technologies adapted to the needs. ISA has been positioned to help create the conditions that would make funding, developing and deploying solar applications on a large scale a reality. ISA is now perceived as key to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and objectives of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

                In a major decision that is likely to give further boost to domestic manufacturing of solar cells in India, MNRE has issued a clarification in respect of domestically manufactured solar PV cell today. 

It may be noted that a number of flagship programmes of MNRE such as KUSUM, have provisions for mandatory use of domestically manufactured solar PV cells. However it was seen that some manufacturers have been importing semi –processed solar PV cells (generally called blue wafer) and making final Solar PV cells with little value addition in India.

The Ministry has clarified that if diffused silicon wafer (generally called ‘Blue Wafer’) is imported and the same is used as raw material for the manufacture of solar PV cells in India, such solar PV cells shall not qualify as domestically manufactured solar PV cells, for the purpose of MNRE’s Schemes / Programmes. A solar PV cell shall be considered to be domestically manufactured only if the same has been manufactured in India, using undiffused silicon wafer (generally called ‘Black Wafer’).

It is expected that this decision will help in establishing a strong solar manufacturing base in India.

The order issued by MNRE in this regard is as below - 

 

“This is in reference to the schemes/ programmes being implemented by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, wherein it is mandatory to use domestically manufactured solar PV cells and domestically manufactured solar PV modules, and also in reference to the Manufacturing-Linked-PPA initiative by Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI).

 

2. A solar PV cell shall be considered to be domestically manufactured only if the same has been manufactured in India, using undiffused silicon wafer (generally called ‘Black Wafer’), classifiable under Customs Tariff Head 3818 and all steps / processes required for manufacturing solar PV cell from the undiffused silicon wafer have been carried out in India.

 

3. If diffused silicon wafer (generally called ‘Blue Wafer’) is imported and the same is used as raw material for the manufacture of solar PV cells in India, such solar PV cells shall not qualify as domestically manufactured solar PV cells, for the purpose of MNRE’s Schemes / Programmes mandating use of domestically manufactured solar PV cells.

 

4. The solar PV cell manufacturing facility required to be set-up under SECI's Manufacturing-Linked-PPA initiative should manufacture solar PV cells from undiffused wafers, as explained above.""

                Reports have appeared ina section of media,citing a CRISIL report, that India may fall short of its declared renewable energy target of 1,75,000 MW by the year 2022. The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy has refuted such claims. Full text of Ministry’s rebuttal is as below - 

“In some of the recent media reports apprehensions have been raised whether India would be able to achieve 1,75,000 MW renewable power installed capacity target by the year 2022. All these have cited the CRISIL report of September 2019. 

However, the doubts are ill-founded and not reflective of the status on the ground and plans ahead.  By the end of September 2019, India has installed more than 82,580 MW of renewable energy capacity with around 31,150 MW of capacity under various stages of installation. Thus, bythe first quarter of 2021, India would have installed more than 1,13,000 MWof renewable power capacity. This would constitute nearly 65 per cent of the targeted capacity.Besides this, around 39,000 MWof renewable power capacity is at various stages of bidding which would be installed by September 2021, taking the percentage of installed capacity to over 87 percentage of the targeted capacity.With only 23,000 MW of renewable power capacity left to bid, India is confident that the target of installing 1,75,000 MW of renewable power capacity will not only be met but exceeded.

The Ministry has worked systematicallyto resolve various issues that arise from time to time,putting in place facilitative and ease of doing business policies and programmes for achieving the goal. Renewable power industry, developers, investors and other stakeholders have lauded Ministry’sefforts fortransparent bidding and facilitation for procurement of power at competitive rates. These initiatives have resulted in significant downward trend in solar and wind power tariffs.  The wind power tariffs has fallen from Rs4.18 per unit in 2016 to Rs.2.43 per unit during last year and even todayit remains below Rs 2.75 per unit. Similarly the solar tariffs have fallen from Rs 4.43 per unit (with VGF) to Rs.2.44per unit.The Government of India’s endeavour remain that renewable power is procured at a rate which is acceptable to distribution companies. 

Since March 2014, India’s renewable power capacity has increased from 34000 MW to 82,580 MW recording 138 percent growth. Globally, India stands 5th in solar power, 4th in wind power, and 4th in total renewable power installed capacity. If large hydro included, India stands 3rd in renewable power capacity globally. India’s renewable energy programme is much beyond production of electricity and covers a basket of applications including use of solar thermal energy for cooling, heating, drying and other industrial applications. Renewable energy has emerged as a true multi-benefit system, combining ecological necessities with domestic priorities, economic and job creation opportunities. 

The journey for expanding the share of renewables in the energy mix has not been without continuous challenges. When the State Government of Andhra Pradesh announced intention to revisit already signed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), the Ministry very quickly clarified that no PPAs can be revisited unless there is a clause to do so in such agreement or a case of malafide of corruption is proved beyond doubt.

The Ministry in consultation with the respective Governments is addressing the issues of allocation of land in Gujarat and revision of land facilitation charges in Rajasthan.Plan for erecting 66,500MW of additional transmission system to ensure evacuation and injection of 1,75,000 MW of power into the main grid is under implementation. The additional transmission would come by October 2021 in phases depending on location based requirements. Also, the Ministry is in the process of developing Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Parks to overcome the problem of land allocation. These parks will have dedicated transmission. First such park is being planned in Dholera, Gujarat by SECI. These apart, the Ministry has strengthened PPA clauses for strengthening investors’ confidence. For mitigating off-takers risk and ensuring timely payments to developers, the Ministry has made letter of credit must for purchase of power by distribution companies.

The Ministry has launched three new schemes. The first is the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme Phase-ll for setting up 12,000 MW grid-connected SPV Power Projects, by the Government Producers with Viability Gap Funding (VGF) support of Rs. 8,580 crore for self-use or use by Government or Government entities, both Central and State Governments. The Scheme mandates use of both SPVcells and modules manufactured domestically as per specifications and testing requirements. The second is PM-KUSUM (PradhanMantriKisanUrjaSurakshaevemUtthanMahabhiyan) scheme to be implemented over next four years for de-dieselization of the farm sector and increasing farmers’ energy independence and income. Under the scheme, India has plans to provide 1.75 million stand-alone solar agriculture pumps and carry out solarisation of 1 million grid connected agriculture pumps by the year 2022. Under the same scheme, Government is also encouraging farmers to set up small solar plants of the size of 500 KW to 2 MW on barren lands for their additional income. Three components combined, the scheme aims to add a solar capacity of 25,750 MW by 2022. The total central financial support provided under the scheme would be Rs. 34,422 crore. The third is Roof Top Solar Phase-II programme SRISTI (Sustainable Rooftop Implementation for Solar Transfiguration of India) scheme for accelerated deployment of solar roof top systems in the country. Under this scheme Central Financial Assistance for 4000 MW of small roof top capacity and incentives to Distribution Companies for 18,000 MW capacity by 2022 have been provided. These schemes will also act as catalyst for adding solar cell and module manufacturing capacity in India. Further, the Tariff Policy is being revised to ensure timely adoption of tariffs. 

The CRISIL report being referred to by the media is neither factually correct nor takes into account initiatives taken by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to facilitate accelerated development and deployment of renewable energy in the country. This report lacks in credibility in all respects as CRISIL did not even bother to consult this Ministry for its views.  

The Ministry is not only confident of meeting 1,75,000 MW target but exceeding it by 2022.”

                In a special homage to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th Birth Anniversary, young students from Delhi & NCR region created two world records here today.

The first world record was in the category of 'environmental sustainability lessons to the largest number of students at one place'. Close to five thousand children participated in this world record. Second record pertains to 'the largest number of assembly & lighting of Solar lamps'. The number of participants in this record is more than five thousand and exact number will be released soon by the officials from Guinness Book of World Records who were present at the event.

Chief Guest of the event Union Minister Shri Prakash Javdekar congratulated all students saying that they had made a solar lamp with their hands and hearts. He also called for creating own oxygen bank by planting at least seven trees during one's lifetime. The Minister expressed happiness over the fact that 79 countries have become member of International Solar Alliance. Shri Javdekar also administered the oath of non violence towards environment to all the students.

Speaking on the occasion, Power Minister Shri RK Singh said that world is facing serious threat from climate change. He said that we all should take pledge that we'll leave a better world for our future generations. The Power Minister further said that future world will be the world of producer not the world of consumer as every home will produce power from solar.

Secretary, MNRE Shri Anand Kumar welcomed all participants and trainers and expressed happiness that so many students had taken pledge of non violence towards environment. He said that there couldn't have been a better tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. He also read out Prime Minister's message for the occasion in which PM highlighted the pivotal role that solar will play in fighting climate change.

A book titled 'Energy Swaraj' was also released and a short film on environment was screened for the participants.

Senior officials from the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy were present at the occasion.

                Out of the 2.5 lakh panchayats in the country 240 panchayats were confered the National Panchayat Awards 2019 by Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, Union Minister for Panchayati Raj in New Delhi today. Congratulating the award winners, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar called upon every panchayat to move ahead for making a new India. The Minister said that Gram Panchayats and Sarpanchs should fully utilize the powers given to them and should formulate the Development Plans for their panchayats at the earliest to effectively implement the Government programs.



Shri Tomar said that every elected representative should be proud of the responsibility given to them by the voters and they are no less than any other elected representative of the country. He also asked the awarded panchayat representatives to be a model and motivation to other panchayats so that they also can learn and strive for betterment.

The Panchayati Raj Ministers from states of Karnataka, Chattisgarh, Assam and Tamil Nadu along with representatives of Panchayati Raj Institutions across the country took part in the award ceremony.



 

The Best performing Panchayats were selected based on various criteria and indicators. This incentivization encourages Panchayat representatives who make special efforts; creates models for other Panchayats and Gram Sabhas to follow and focuses public attention on Panchayats’ performance, which encourages all Panchayats to improve their performance. Finally, this creates an eco-system for overall good governance at the local level. 

The Awards were given under the following categories:

i. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Panchayat Sashaktikaran Puraskar (DDUPSP): given to best performing Panchayats (District, Intermediate and Gram) in recognition of the good work done for improving delivery of services and public goods. DDUPSPs are given for general and following nine thematic categories:

• Sanitation

                The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) observes the Vigilance Awareness Week from 28th October to 2nd November, 2019. This is observed every year during the week in which the birthday of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (31st October) falls. This awareness week campaign affirms our commitment to promotion of integrity and probity in public life through citizen participation. 

 “Integrity- A way of life” has been chosen as the theme for the Vigilance Awareness Week this year by the Commission.  Integrity and Ethics form the foundational pillars of a nation and national development takes place when individuals and organizations are committed to integrity as a core value. Combating corruption is not just a matter of making laws and creating institutions, but is deeply rooted in human values and morals of individuals. Cultivating ethical values is essential for building a New India. 

The Commission believes that this theme would help draw the attention of all sections of society especially the youth to the significance of ethical conduct in the building of an honest, non discriminatory and corruption free society. 

The Commission has requested all Central Government Ministries/Organizations to conduct activities relevant to the theme both within their organization, and outreach activities for public/citizens as follows:

 


	Activities to be conducted within the organization include taking of the Integrity Pledge by all employees, distribution of pamphlets/handouts on preventive vigilance activities, whistle blower mechanism and other anti-corruption measures, conducting workshops and sensitization programmes for employees and other stake holders on policies/procedures of the organization and preventive vigilance measures. Other activities include publication of  journals / newsletters on vigilance issues, systemic improvements and good practices adopted for wider dissemination and awareness, conducting various competitions such as debates, quiz etc. for the employees and their families on issues relating to anti-corruption and the use of organizational websites for dissemination of employees/customer oriented information.


 


	Outreach activities for public/citizens include the display of hoardings, banners, posters and distribution of handouts etc. at prominent locations/places in offices/field units and also at places with public interface , organization of grievance redressal camps for citizens/customers by organizations having customer oriented services/activities and the taking of the online “Integrity Pledge” developed by the Commission. 


 


	Laying stress for creation of awareness on the ill-effects of corruption amongst school and college students, various activities such as lectures, panel discussions, debates, quiz, essay writing, slogans/elocution/cartoon/poster competitions on moral values, ethics, good governance practices etc. are to be organized in schools and colleges across the country. In 2018, such activities were organized in over 19,333 schools and over 5120 colleges with the participation of more than 22  lakh children across the country. 


The establishment of ‘Integrity Clubs’ in schools and colleges is an initiative to cultivate ethical values in the leaders of tomorrow. 

“Awareness Gram Sabhas” are organized for dissemination of awareness in Gram Panchayats (in rural and semi-urban areas) to sensitize the rural citizens about the ill-effects of corruption. In 2018 year, 73,655  such Gram Sabhas were organized during the Vigilance Awareness Week.  

Seminars, discussions and other outreach events are being organized involving the private sector, professional associations, trade unions and associations for wide participation of all sections of civil society.

Organizations conduct activities with high visibility and public appeal such as walkathons, marathons, cycle rallies, human chains, street plays and other public functions in various cities and towns across the country. 

Many organizations extensively use social media platforms , bulk SMS/E-mail, Whatsapp, electronic and print media etc. for spreading awareness.

                The MoS (PMO) Dr Jitendra Singh said that Jammu & Kashmir was most exploited by the champions of Article 370. Speaking about the threat to ‘Identity’ of Kashmiriyat after scrapping of Article 370, he said that opposite to the common perception, the state was most exploited under the pretext of Article 370. He said that this is a historical decision under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and the strategy of Home Minister Shri Amit Shah. He was speaking on the occasion of presentation of a report by GIA. A delegation of Group of Intellectuals and Academicians (GIA) presented a ‘Report from Ground Zero’ on Jammu, Kashmir & Ladakh after setting aside of Article 370 & 35A. Founded in 2015, GIA is a group of professional women and entrepreneurs, media persons and academicians committed to social-justice and nation-building.

The delegation briefed the MoS (PMO) about the findings of their observations after field study of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir in three teams. They also gave their inputs and recommendations. They briefed that common man across religions, sections and various professional backgrounds in J&K has expressed happiness about the decision of the Government to scrap Article 370. The group also interacted with people living in border areas of J&K and took their views into consideration.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that contrary to the misinformation being spread by certain sections about the clampdown situation in J&K, this year has been the most peaceful festive season in the last many years. He added that important festivals like Eid, Independence Day have been celebrated in a peaceful manner after many years. He added that vested interests of some people have led to these misleading perceptions about the threat to identity of people from Jammu & Kashmir. He questioned whether Article 370 is required to save the identity of people in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Bengal. He said that the decision is a revolutionary step and it is difficult to even imagine such initiative being taken. The fruits of this decision will be realised slowly in future, the Minister added.

Dr Singh referred to yesterday’s decision of Central Government that the Government employees of J&K and Ladakh will get salaries and benefits as per the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations. The annual financial implication of the allowances like children education allowance, hostel allowance, transport allowance, LTC, fixed medical allowance for them will be around Rs 4,800 crore, he added. He said that now the Government employees of J&K can also avail the benefits availed in other parts of the country.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that after 31st October, many women-welfare related provisions will also be implemented. He quoted examples of doing away with Article 35A, applicability of Dowry Prohibition Act, Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and others. These Central Laws will be made applicable to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir; and Union Territory of Ladakh.

Speaking about the industry, Dr Singh said that there are now no barriers in the industrial development of J&K. He added that development in J&K will also curb the ‘youth exodus’ from there, as there will be ample opportunities available to them, from which they were deprived earlier. The Minister added that the development model of North East can be replicated in J&K. He added that food processing parks can be opened for apples, strawberry and other fruits on the lines of citrus fruit park in North East. He said that other products of J&K such as Pashmina, saffron also have huge commercial potential which needs to be tapped for the economic well being of people of J&K. On the militancy issue, the Minister said that terrorism and militancy are in the last phase in Jammu and Kashmir.

MoS (PMO) Dr Jitendra Singh congratulated the GIA team members for their efforts and said that it is a responsible initiative because most of the members are from intellectual community in their respective areas. He said that their report provides answer to many questions that are being raised these days. He added that the report is not based on just one visit to J&K, but based on research for long time and after being associated with Kashmir issue for years.

Speaking about the report being presented to him today, Dr Singh said that the inputs given in the report will be considered seriously. He added many new schemes are being prepared by various departments for implementation in J&K, so that it does not lag behind in development as compared to any other part of the country.

                The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh today hailed the Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana  as a unique and successful health insurance scheme launched by  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in 2018. 

Addressing  the Asia Health-2019 conference in New Delhi today Dr. Jitendra Singh  said that  over 50 lakh people have benefited from  this scheme and the government is taking healthcare protection to a new aspirational  level.  It is the “world’s largest government funded healthcare program” targeting more than 50 crore beneficiaries, he added. 

Dr. Jitendra Singh  suggested that in a heterogeneous  and  dynamic nation like India  the fundamental priorities  need to be considered  while  determining  the  spectrum of healthcare and disease. We can not copy the West or other countries of the world in this connection. Though we need qualitative and quantitative changes in the health care sector but we should always keep in mind the disease spectrum and trait of dynamism occurring  in  India.  He said that India is evolving state and the disease and healthcare spectrum should be determined according to it. 

Speaking on the Data  on health care in India, Dr.Singh said that we need to do much more on it as the disease spectrum has changed a lot since the last 30-40 years. The diseases which were unheard in India in the past have become very much prevalent now a days  like heart disease or diabetes etc. Some of the diseases which were confined to some areas or States only are no longer limited to that area, the socio-cultural milieu does not determined the data on health care, therefore need to work on data collection is essential, he added. 

 Dr. Jitendra Singh also emphasized  on the importance of  human interface in the healthcare sector. He said  that new technology is needed but there is no alternatives for human interface in the health care. 

MoS, Dr, Jitendra Singh also said that India is a younger nation as 70 per cent  of its population is below the age of 40 years who will achieve the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of making India a 5 trillion  economy by 2024. And for stopping this young  energy of the nation to wither away we have to concentrate on providing good health care system to them . 

While concluding his address , Dr.Singh said that  we have to take care of preventive part of healthcare system in  India to get rid of the epidemics of the preventable diseases otherwise these diseases will continue to grow unless we evolve a system  targeting  the prevention part. 

The Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, Prof. K. Vijay Raghavan was also present on the occasion.

                The Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah presided over the 14th Annual convention of the Central Information Commission as Chief Guest. Also present was Minister of State for Ministry of Development of North East Region (Independent Charge); Minister of State for the Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension, Departments of Space and Atomic Energy, Dr. Jitendra Singh.

In his address, Shri Shah expressed pleasure at the functioning of the Right to Information (RTI) Act and said that in the 14 years since its enactment, the purpose and objective of the act has been fulfilled. He added that the main objective of RTI was to increase trust of people in the system of governance, and the act has been successful in instilling and strengthening the faith of the people that the system functions within the boundaries defined by the Constitution. He noted that this trust automatically increases a sense of partnership and ownership of people in governance, and this sense of partnership goes a long way in making the nation progress.

Shri Shah also said that in 1947, India attained freedom from a long era of oppression where the objective of the administration was discriminatory and was to fulfill the wishes of foreign masters, as opposed to looking after the welfare of people. This objective and the steps taken in that direction caused a disconnect between people and the administration. Shri Shah remarked that till 2005, no steps taken to remove this disconnect had been successful, but in the last 14 years, this gap is being fulfilled by the transparency and accountability ushered in through RTI. He called transparency and accountability the twin pillars of good governance and hailed RTI as a major milestone for good governance.

Shri Shah noted that RTI has channelized and transformed civil society into a force that ensures accountability from the government. He said that while till 1990 only 11 nations had some form of RTI, this number increased with information revolution and globalization, and  this increase has helped advance the cause of good governance globally. He hailed India as the first nation to have successfully created an accountability system till the last leg of governance. He said that India has nearly 5 lakh information officers working to fulfill the writ of RTI at different levels of government, and such a large number of officers working for the cause of transparency and accountability is unseen anywhere else in the world.

Shri Shah praised RTI as a great step to remove injustice and corruption from the system and increase the efficiency of governance. He said that RTI removes arbitrariness from governance and acts as a major grievance redressal tool. He said that the use of high technology methods like video conference and digitization of RTI files makes the lives of litigants easier.

Shri Shah said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the government is committed to creating a system where there is enough suo moto declaration of information that the need to file RTI applications itself is reduced. He said that the success of a transparent government lies not in an increase in the number of RTI applications but in the fact that RTI applications reduce in spite of the RTI process being completely accessible to people.

Shri Shah expounded upon the dichotomy between RTI and Data Protection laws. He noted the importance of proactive, suo moto declaration of information by the government and said that from Mudra to online registrations of FIR, the use of internet has helped infuse transparency in the system. He said that the job of officers dealing with RTI is to create awareness, and that people should know they do not need RTI for many things for which the government proactively declares information.

Shri Shah noted that there has been very little misuse of RTI and said that this shows the maturity of our democracy. He said that awareness regarding transparency should not be limited to quasi-judicial proceedings and disposal of cases but govt servants should instead actively reach out to people to make them aware of the proactive steps taken by government to increase transparency, accountability and efficiency in the government.

Shri Shah gave the example of the Kedarnath all weather road as a successful attempt to harness technology to increase transparency in government projects. He also mentioned the GeM (Government e-Marketplace) portal where the smallest vendor can be part of govt tendering. He hailed the portal as a major step forward for small industries and reiterated that the government was committed to creating a system where people would not need to use RTI because information would be proactively disclosed and available in public domain.

Shri Shah advised the officers present that they should increase the sense of responsibility in people, along with awareness about RTI. He said that RTI should not be misused or used for personal enmity or vendetta. He said that the power of RTI brought with it the responsibility to use it carefully. He added that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi was determined to create a system where information was given freely, so that people would not need to resort to RTI.  He added that the government would further ease the process of RTI to take justice and accountability to the last mile. He said that RTI would go a long way in the creation of a welfare state envisaged by the makers of our Constitution, and New India as envisioned by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the government has further strengthened the cause of transparency and accountability by creating an online portal for RTI, which did not exist previously. He said that the proactive increase in transparency in the last five years has led to a reduction in the need for RTI. He added that in 2019 alone, more than 12 lakh RTI related grievances have been redressed successfully. He said that the government has taken several steps to increase awareness about RTI, but cautioned that the law should not be misused.

The Minister said that the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has adopted the Mantra of 'Maximum Governance, Minimum Government' from the very beginning. He quoted the example of making efforts in the direction of doing away with the practice of attestation of documents by the gazetted officers. He added that to bring transparency in governance, the DoPT has done away with the practice of interview for recruitment at the lower level posts w.e.f January 2016. Speaking about the RTI, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government has started an RTI portal in order to bring more transparency in implementing of RTI Act. He added that to bring maximum governance, Modi Government scrapped the redundant and obsolete rules during the last five years. 

Dr Singh said that Modi Government's call for  zero tolerance towards corruption has been implemented in each and every  functioning of the Govt. He said that the Government has made efforts to reform the training curriculum in order to make administrative services more people-friendly. He added that PM's Excellence Awards are being given to the districts for their performance in implementing the priority programmes. The problem of stagnation in promotions has also been resolved by giving promotions to 4,500 employees early this year and this process still continues, he added. The MoS added that now everything is in public domain as all ACC appointments are put on website first and then circulated to the concerned departments and persons. 

Speaking about the redressal of public Grievances, the Minister said that Public Grievance Cell has become pro-active and more responsive. There is visible surge in satisfaction level in the people and there is a telephonic feedback system in DARPG where random phone calls are made to the complainants to check their satisfaction level after disposal of their grievances. The Minister said that awareness needs to be created among the people about the RTI to reduce the load on administration of unwanted RTIs and added that RTI rule was brought with good intentions and it should be used for good cause only, he added. 

The Chief Information Commissioner Shri Sudhir Bhargava remarked that the annual convention offers an opportunity to reflect and introspect on the implementation of RTI Act and the success it has achieved in furthering our shared democratic values.

The inaugural Session was followed by three brain storming Sessions on Gandhian thoughts and RTI, RTI as a tool of effective Governance and RTI Act -  challenges ahead.

To celebrate the 150th birth of Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, the first session was on Gandhian thoughts and RTI.

Former Chief Information Commissioner, who was the first Chief Information Commissioner, Shri Wajahat Habibullah, Shri A. N. Tiwari former Chief Information Commissioner and Shri Shyamlal Yadav, Senior Editor, Indian Express shared their thoughts on the subject. The Speakers explained how RTI has enhanced transparency and accountability in the working of Government and how it can lead to a more effective governance. Shri Wajahat Habibullah, first Chief Information Commissioner, Central Information Commission elaborated that RTI is instrumental in attaining the dream of Swaraj. This is achieved by holding the Government responsible for dissemination of information to common citizens especially the poor. Shri A.N.

                A delegation of Pak occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK) Displaced Persons today called on Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh and thanked him for the Union Cabinet's decision to include 5300 families of Displaced Persons also in the Rehabilitation Package, which was announced in 2016 on the directions of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

The members of the delegation wanted to seek certain clarifications about the implementation part of the Cabinet decision taken yesterday and requested that, following yesterday's cabinet decision, the benefits of the Rehabilitation Package should be uniformly available to 5300 Displaced families which had been left out of the package earlier and the procedure for this should be simple.

Following the request from the members of delegation, Dr Jitendra Singh arranged a meeting of the delegation with senior officers of Union Home Ministry dealing with the subject of Rehabilitation Package. The members of the delegation later said, their inputs and suggestions were received with patience which, the Home Ministry would examine in course of time and try to make the procedure as simple and convenient as possible.

Dr Jitendra Singh described the Cabinet decision of yesterday as yet another major breakthrough for Jammu & Kashmir under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said that the government has the capacity and courage to take decisions and therefore, it is this government which can take the decisions to resolve these issues. 

Dr Jitendra Singh appealed to guard against false rumors or misinformation sought to be spread by certain vested interests, who are uncomfortable with the government's decisive approach to resolve all the J&K related matters, whether that be Article 370, 35-A or West Pak Refugees or PoJK Displaced Persons or Kashmiri Pandits.

In the times to come, Dr Jitendra Singh assured that the new set up after 31st of October will unfold huge benefits which will be realised only when these unfold in the next few months.

Besides Mahendra Mehta, prominent members of the delegation included Shyam Gupta, Madan Mohan, Bodh Raj, Manoj Khandelwal and others.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi attended the valedictory session of Assistant Secretaries (2017 IAS batch) here today. The MoS (PP), Dr Jitendra Singh, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, Dr. P.K. Mishra, Cabinet Secretary, Shri Rajiv Gauba, Secretary (DoPT) Dr C. Chandramouli and senior officers were also present on the occasion.

The officers made several presentations to the Prime Minister on themes ranging from Transforming Aspirational Districts to Governance Solutions for Transparency and Faster Delivery.

The Prime Minister encouraged the officers to be receptive towards new ideas, new concepts and perspectives. One should take feedback from multiple sources, analyze them and incorporate them, PM said. He asked the officers to strive for continuous learning and to foster curiosity.

Interacting with officers, Prime Minister said that maintaining service orientation is paramount for a civil servant as it will bring out neutrality.

Emphasizing on the importance of public participation, he urged the young officers to encourage collective efforts for effective implementation of government schemes. He exhorted the officers to imbibe the best experiences they had during the course of being Assistant Secretary.

Prime Minister appreciated the young officers for their presentations and wished them the best for their roles ahead. “Your success is important for the nation. Your success can transform the lives of many people”, PM said.

The Cabinet Secretary, Shri Rajiv Gauba said that during their career, these officers have to fulfil important responsibilities in states & Centre and this attachment helps them to understand the functioning of Central Government flagship programmes closely. This practice was started in the year 2015 and this is the 5th such batch to be attached with Central ministries and departments, he said. He further added that there were 169 IAS officers of 2017 batch, who gained this experience this year. Shri Gauba conveyed his best wishes to the officers.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the Review of Guidelines for Granting Authorization to market Transportation Fuels. This marks a major reform of the guidelines for marketing of petrol and diesel. 

The existing policy for granting authorization to market transportation fuels had not undergone any changes for the last 17 years since 2002. It has now been revised to bring it in line with the changing market dynamics and with a view to encourage investment from private players, including foreign players, in this sector. The new Policy will give a fillip to ‘Ease of Doing Business’, with transparent policy guidelines. It will boost direct and indirect employment in the sector. Setting up of more retail outlets (ROs) will result in better competition and better services for consumers 

Salient features & Major Impact:


	Much lower entry barrier for private players - the entities seeking authorisation would need to have a minimum net worth of Rs.250 crore vis-à-vis the current requirement of Rs. 2000 crore prior investment.
	Non – Oil Companies can also invest in the retail sector. Requirement of prior investment in Oil and Gas Sector, mainly in exploration and production, refining, pipelines/terminals etc., has been done away with.
	The entities seeking market authorisation for petrol and diesel are allowed to apply for retail and bulk authorisation separately or both
	The companies have been given flexibility in setting up a Joint Venture or Subsidiary for market authorisation.
	In addition to conventional fuels, the authorized entities are required to install facilities for marketing at least one new generation alternate fuel, like CNG, LNG, biofuels, electric charging, etc. at their proposed retail outlets within 3 years of operationalization of the said outlet
	More private players, including Foreign players, are expected to invest in retail fuel marketing leading to better competition and better services for consumers 
	The new entities will bring in latest technology for marketing of fuels and also encourage digital payments at the ROs.
	Entities will also encourage employment of women and ex-servicemen at the retail outlets. 
	CCTV facilities will be set up at all retail outlets
	The authorised entities are required to set up minimum 5% of the total retail outlets in the notified remote areas within 5 years of grant of authorisation. A robust monitoring mechanism has been set up to monitor this obligation.
	An individual may be allowed to obtain dealership of more than one marketing company in case of open dealerships of PSU OMCs but at different sites.

The Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today reviewed oil and gas projects being undertaken in the Russian far-east, including India Russia joint collaborations. Far-east in Russia has vast mineral opportunities, with Russian government keen to partner with India. The proposed joint projects are expected to further add strength to our time-tested bilateral friendship.

The Minister also visited the shipbuilding Complex, Zvezda.  The Zvezda shipyard is poised to make a huge contribution in the development of Arctic shipping and developing shipping routes between Russia and India.  Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had visited the Zvezda ship building complex back in September’19 during his historic visit to Vladivostok, Russia. During Shri Pradhan’s visit to Zvezda, he was accompanied by  CEO, Rosneft Mr Igor Sechin who demonstrated the cutting edge technologies there. 

As a follow up to the visit of Hon’ble Prime Minister to Vladivostok for the Eastern Economic Forum in September 2019, the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel is currently on a 4-day visit to Vladivostok.

                Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, accompanied by an official and business delegation, will be visiting Russia and Japan from 22-26 October 2019.

As a follow up to the visit of Hon’ble Prime Minister to Vladivostok for the Eastern Economic Forum in September 2019, the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel will visit Vladivostok on 22-25 October 2019. During his visit, the Minister will have meetings with Mr. Sergey Tyrtsev, First Deputy Minister for Development of the Russian Far East and Arctic, and with Mr. Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft. He will also visit the shipbuilding Complex,Zvezda and the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in Russia’s Far East. Possible areas of collaboration in other sectors like coking coal, and shipping routes will also be discussed.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, a PSU under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, had joined Sakhalin-1 consortium by acquiring 20% participating interest in July 2001. The project is one of the largest single foreign direct investments in Russia.

In addition, Engineers India Ltd. (EIL), another PSU under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, will sign anMoU with the Russian National Chamber of Engineers. The MoU will strengthen the symbiotic bilateral energy cooperation as the technical expertise of both organisations will help EIL in providing its services for upcoming projects across the hydrocarbons value chain in Russia

At the invitation of the Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, ShriPradhan will visit Tokyo, Japan, from 25-26 October to participate in the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity (GFSEC) Ministerial meeting. Presently, Japan holds the Chair of this Global Forum. The proposed GFSEC meeting will involve policy discussions.Further, the Minister will have a meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Mr. Isshu Sugawara to discuss issues of bilateral collaboration in the fields of energy as well as steel. ShriPradhan will also have meetings with Japanese steel industries to discuss strengthening collaborative investments in India.In addition, meetings of the Minister with his counterpart Ministers from other countries are also scheduled, on the sidelines of the Ministerial meeting.


India and Japan have lot of synergies in the energy sector. In the run up to energy transition in India to a gas based economy, India is collaborating on a big scale with Japan in the LNG sector, to inter alia, exchange best practices and to develop a flexible global LNG Market

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan participated in the 2nd Annual India Leadership Summit of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum here today.While sharing his views on “India’s Role in Geo-politics of Energy”, in a conversation with Mr Tim Roemer, Former Ambassador of US to India, Shri Pradhan said “Today, India is the hotspot in energy investment destination in the world. Policy reforms introduced by the Government under leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi have further simplified doing business in India.I invite all energy players to bring their technology & investment here & become a part of India's growth story.” He said that the Country has moved to open, transparent, process-driven policy atmosphere, and all are welcome to invest. The investing Companies must bring technology, capital and good business models to India. 

Speaking about India’s efforts towards decarbonisation, he said, “Under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is expanding its footprints in carbon-free energy, including renewables and bio-energy. Technology and innovation can become game changers for India's quest for decarbonising and developing into a gas-based economy for a cleaner & sustainable energy future.” He said that India had set an ambitious target of producing 175 GW energy through renewable energy sources which has been further enhanced to 450 GW.

Dwelling upon the issues of ethanol and bio-energy, he further added, “From less than 1% ethanol blending in 2015, we have increased our EBP to 6%. We are working to push up the percentage even further.Bioenergy is also being pushed in a big way with Govt's focus on ways to monetise the 600MT of non-fossilised biomass available in the country.” He said that 10 billion dollars investment is to be made in setting up ethanol plants in the country.The US can collaborate with us through deployment of its technological innovations and capital resources in India and become partner in India’s bio-fuel revolution, he added.

Talking about India-US partnership, Minister Pradhan said, “Energy is increasingly an important component of our bilateral trade. Our crude oil import from USA was almost nil in 2014. Now, the total import of petroleum products from USA including LNG in 2018-19 stood at over 7 billion dollars, and is likely to go up further this year.” 


On the issue of India’s role in global energy landscape, he added, “Growth in global energy consumption will be driven by India. India's vibrant market presents immense opportunity.World is moving towards a new energy model. We are committed to implement Hon’ble PM Modi’s vision which will ensure that India leads the global energy transition.”India is going to lead energy transformation in the country, he added.

                The India Ministerial Dialoguewas held at third India Energy Forum by CERAWeek here today in which Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel,Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Pralhad Joshi, Minister of Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs, and Shri R.K. Singh, Minister of State (I/C) of Power and New & Renewable Energy and Minister of State, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship participated. 

          

In his welcome address, Minister of Petroleum &Natural Gas& Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said that thepresence of ministersat the Forum is a testimony to the high importance that theGovernment accords to the India’s energy sector in a dynamic global energy landscape. He said “Hon’ble Prime Minister has given us a target to transform the Indian economy to a 5 trilliondollar in the next five years.We are making concerted efforts and taking all necessary steps to make this a reality. Energy sector will be fueling India’s journey towards this stated goal of a 5 trilliondollareconomy. 

 



 

Shri Pradhan said that given its huge energy appetite and growth potential, India will be the key driver of global energy demand in the coming decades – in fact, it will experience the fastest growth in energy consumption among all large economies. To meet this huge demand, India would need a healthy mix of all commercially viable energy sources.India will chart its own course of energy transition in a responsible manner and would greatly influence global energy transition. Giving a glimpse of India’s path of energy transition, he said that the share of renewables in electricity capacity has significantly gone up now to 22% from around 10% in 2014-15. Secondly, the ethanol blending percentage has risen from 0.67% in 2012-13 to now close to 6%. Finally,more than 95% households now have access to LPG, making their kitchens smoke free.

Shri Piyush Goyal said that we are on cusp of Energy revolution -energy has become an essential commodity in our bilateral trade engagements with several key trading partners, we are improving domestic coal production, reducing import dependency, and Gas is playing an important role in energy basket. He said that Indian Railways is on path to be 100% electrified by 2023. “Hon’ble Prime Minister Modi has shown the world, the path to climate justice and a sustainable future. Modern technologies, efficiency in production are transforming the landscape.Mr. Pradhan has been on the right track in taking forward India on the path to becoming a gas based economy.”, he added.



Shri Pralhad Joshi said that today there are proven technologies to use coal in a cleaner and more sustainable way, and washeries are being set up. He said that for next 20-30 years, coal will continue to play an important role in Indian energy scenario. He mentioned about setting up of a fertilizer plant in Odisha which would be first of its kind in terms of using coal gasification technology. “While my mandate is to ensure availability of coal, we are equally sensitive about environment issues. Our per capita consumption of coal is about 1/10th of that of the United States.With help of technologies, we are going to use coal in a much cleaner way.We are going big on reclamation of mining areas and afforestation.Energy affordability is key to improving energy access.”, Shri Joshi said.

Shri R.K. Singh said that We are preparing for a low- carbon energy future as our Government has aimed to set up a 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. He said that the Government has succeeded in providing electricity to almost all the households in the country. The energy consumption is increasing and so is power production. The national power grid has become a reality. He said that Natural Gas offers an option of a balancing fuel, as it has proven capability to compliment renewables. He said, “India is an attractive destination for global investors. Power sector has seen tremendous change in the last five years. We have travelled from being a power deficit nation to a power surplus nation.We have made a quantum leap in our renewable energy capacity. We are one of the fastest growing producers and consumers of renewable energy. We have laid down stringent emission standards for our power plants.In the last five years we have carried out unparalleled and fastest and largest increase in access to energy the world has witnessed. Speaking about investment potential India holds, he said, “If you are in energy, you must be in India.”

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas &Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has called for inclusion of petroleum products under GST regime. Speaking at third India Energy Forum by CERAWeek in New Delhi today, he appealed to the union finance ministerto take this up in the GST council and at least make a beginning byincluding natural gas and ATF in theGST. He said “It’sbeentwoyearssincetheintroductionof historic tax reform the GST was implemented by decisive leadership of Prime Minister Modi.Given the complexity of petroleum sector and the revenue dependence ofstate governments in this sector, petroleum products have been kept outside the ambit of GST regime.There has been continuous demand from the petroleum industry forinclusion of petroleum products under GST regime.”

 



Shri Pradhan said thatno single form of energy can meet the growing energy demand in India given India’sdevelopment imperative that aims to ensure energy justice to all. Mixing all commerciallyviable energy sources is the only feasible way forward in our context. India will chart its own course of energy transition in a responsible manner.

The Minister highlighted several measures taken by the Government to overhaul the hydrocarbon policy framework to revitalize oil and gas ecosystem and establish a conducive business environment. Growing presence of global oil and gas majors like Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, BP, Shell, Total, Rosneft and ExxonMobil in India is a testimony to the faith and confidence of global investors on promising India’s growth story. He said “I am glad to see investors, MakinginIndia, for India, and also for the globe.”

 Shri Pradhan said that we have successfully completed three bid rounds under Open Acreage Licensing Policy and two rounds of bidding under the Discovered Small Fields (DSF) policy. Through these successful biddings, India is expected to garner an estimated investment of 58 billion US dollars in E & P sector by 2023. He said that Special thrust is being given to promote gas based economy under the guidance of Hon’ble Prime Minister Modi. “Iamhappytoinformyouthataswespeak, an estimated investment of 60 billion US dollars is lined up in building gaspipelines, terminals, and City Gas infrastructure that are in different stages ofimplementation.”, he added. The City Gas Distribution network development in India which hasbeen authorized for building and commissioning will cover half of India’s geography and would serve 70%of India’s population through availability of low carbon and affordable natural gas.

The Minister expressed the Government’s commitment to make India a low carbon economy, though our per capita carbon emission is far less than the world average particularly the OECD countries. Regarding the downstream sector, he said that ithasbeen completely liberalized. Market driven pricing of major petroleum products reflects the changes in line with the international price of crude oil. “Our fuel standards are comparable to the best in world and pan India BS-VI complaint fuel will be available in India from 1 April2020.”, Shri Pradhan said. 

To promote the energy sustainability, the Minister said that we are giving thrust on biofuels. The new National Biofuel policy envisages an integrated approach to produce biofuels from various types of agriculture residue and municipal solid waste. Biofuel policy will help farmers to become “urjadata from anndata”.An important initiative has been undertaken to produce compressed biogas from biomass waste. We have made a target to setup 5000 compressed biogas plants in different parts of the country. These plants are being setup by private entrepreneurs. Oil marketing companies are offering assured price and offtake guarantee to procure the compressed biogas. Highlighting some difficulties being faced by these private entrepreneurs to access to bank finance for setting up CBG plants, he requested Finance Minister to look into this challenge. The Minister said that We also aim to achieve 10% blending percentage of ethanol in petrol by 2022 to cut dependence on energy import, promote the use of environment-friendly fuel and boost the agriculture sector.We are accelerating conversion of Used Cooking Oil (UCO) to biodiesel across 100 cities in India.

Inaugurating the Conference, the finance Minister Smt Nirmala Sitharaman said that India is becoming an attractive destination for foreign investors. Highlighting the recent announcements to bring down the Corporate Tax rates, she said that atmosphere to invest is friendlier now. She also talked about the amendments in the Companies act and IBC Code, stating that the focus is now on compliance. SmtSitharaman assured that Energy sector is on top of agenda, and we are in the cusp of energy transition. The finance Minister said that the Government will ensure that the commitments made to the investors are honored. Reiterating the Government’s commitment to COP-21 targets, she said that renewable energy sources are being encouraged. She said that India wants to widen its basket of energy sources. Lauding the Government’s initiatives to provide cooking gas fuel and electricity to all the people of the country, she said that the Government had taken up these initiatives on mission mode, benefitting a large population. 

 



 



The theme of third India Energy Forum by CERAWeek Conference is ‘New India’s Energy @75: Balancing Energy Security and Sustainability’. 1200 delegates from 15 countries and 300 companies are participating in the 3-day conference.

                Securing affordable and sustainable energy figures as a top agenda for India. Speaking at the session on ‘Re-energizing India’ at the India Economic Summit here today, the Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel minister Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said “Today, we are meeting in the backdrop of a major oil and gas crisis, resulting from attacks on Saudi oil processing plants at Abqaiq and Khurais. The price volatility and concerns about sustained oil supplies have made consuming countries vulnerable given the fact that India, along with most South Asian countries, have a major dependency on crude oil & gas imports. So securing affordable and sustainable energy figures as a top agenda for all these countries, including India.”



The Minister said that it is only natural that the global energy deliberations pay close attention to the developments in energy sector in India. This has a lot to do with the emergence of India as third-largest energy consumer in the world, and the fact that India is playing a leading role globally by implementing several transformative initiatives to reduce energy poverty in the country.

 



 

ShriPradhan said “As we seek to transform India into a 5 trillion dollar economy, it is imperative to increase energy availability to 1.3 billion people, whose per capita energy consumption is lower than the global average. The energy demand, thus, is estimated to grow at 4.2 percent per annum up to 2035. Our approach to re-energize India will be guided by the Energy Vision of India, as enunciated by Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, covering the four pillars of energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security. As part of our integrated approach towards energy planning, energy justice will also be a key objective in itself.”

Referring to the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the UN Climate Action Summit 2019 last week in New York, where he spelt out the elements of approach to meet energy demand keeping in view India’s strong commitment to COP 21 and sustainable development, Shri Pradhan said that India will increase the share of non-fossil fuels, by increasing renewable energy capacity to much beyond 175 GW by 2022, and later upto 450 GW. “We will make our transport sector green through e-mobility. The proportion of the biofuel blend in petrol and diesel will be increased. As we reorient energy policies, in this age of unprecedented energy transition, we will lay emphasis on advancing inclusive access, secure, affordable and sustainable energy services.”, he added.

The minister expressed the Government’s determination to end energy poverty in the country, which is evident from the outcomes of path-breaking policies and initiatives taken during the last five years, and also those set in motion since June this year. He said that in this pursuit, we are paying close attention to innovation and clean energy.

Mentioning about the Prime Minister’s vision of Neighbourhood First, Shri Pradhan said that India has taken initiatives to develop mutually beneficial energy corridors with other South Asian countries. The commissioning of the India-Nepal Petroleum Products Pipeline last month marks a new era in this regard. India is also partnering with Maldives in changing over to energy efficient LED bulbs. “There is a definite need for integrating energy sources be it petroleum products, LPG or LNG in South Asia through regional electricity and gas grids. We are also working to reduce the carbon footprints by transfer of hydropower from Nepal and Bhutan to India, and to the countries in the region.”, he added.

On the issue of moving towards the gas economy, Shri Pradhan said that over 16,000 km of gas pipeline has been built and an additional 11,000 km is under construction. With the tenth bid round for City Gas Distribution completed, it will cover over 400 districts and will extend coverage to 70 percent of our population. A Blue Flame Revolution is transforming India’s energy landscape. LPG coverage has reached more than ninety percent from fifty-five percent five years ago. The eighty millionth LPG connection was handed over last month. “Our success in Ujjwala programme has attracted enormous global interest, including many developing countries keen to emulate this model of providing clean cooking fuel. Our immediate objective will be to enhance use of LPG in the South Asia region. We will, for the first time, be sourcing LPG from Bangladesh for our north-eastern states.”, he said. Just two days back, the National Capital Region moved into BS-VI grade fuel, equivalent to EURO VI standards, six months ahead of time. Cleaner fuels for transportation will continue to be an area of high priority.  

Shri Pradhan said that India is now leading the global movement in embracing renewable energy sources. India’s energy diplomacy resulted in the establishment of the International Solar Alliance (ISA). “We are leading by example, with a rapid growth in installed solar generating capacity targeted to reach 100 GW by 2022. This is made possible with significant improvements in technology, price and performance. Moreover, creative business models have spurred investment in this sector. We are well on our way to achieve this target.India has more than doubled the renewable power installed in the country to 82 GW in 2019 during the last 5 years. To gear up for significant expansion of RE power, apart from MNRE, institutions such as IREDA, SECI, as well as state and central regulators would be promoting their relative roles.”, he added.

Shri Pradhan also highlighted the Prime Minister Modi’s vision of creating agri-entrepreneurs by transforming annadata to urjadata, which is another major transformative change taking shape in the country. Alternative fuels like ethanol, second-generation ethanol, compressed biogas and bio-diesel, will help in reducing country’s crude oil import dependence.  

The Minister said that another testimony of success in major path-breaking initiatives is evident from the fact that India recorded the highest growth of foreign energy investments anywhere in the world, which touched 85 billion dollars. “Our target to transform India to a 5 trillion dollars’ economy by 2024 requires a gradual and a measured energy transition by deploying all sources of energy.We seek to provide energy justice to all in the country with wider supply of environmentally-compatible energy sources to its vast population.’,ShriPradhan said.

ShriDharmendraPradhanalso participated in the session on “Accelerating the Skills Agenda”. Taking part in the discussions, ShriPradhan said “India is a bright spot in the global growth story. Skilling and re-skilling are going to be important drivers for India becoming $5 trillion economy.We must make our workforce ready for the future of jobs. In a changing world driven by technology and innovation, lifelong skilling is imperative. We must have a roadmap with practical deliverables.”



 

India is one of the first countries to establish the Closing the Skills Gap Accelerator in partnership with World Economic Forum. It is a national public-private collaboration platform to address skills gaps and reshape education for the future of work. The accelerator brings together business, government, civil society, academia and the education and training sectors to collectively drive systems change.

                To mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October as Rashtriya Swachhta Diwas, Secretary, Petroleum and Natural Gas Dr M.M.Kutty today flagged off the publicity vans in Delhi, to generate awareness among the people about the OMCs’ initiative of  converting Used Cooking Oil to Biodiesel.  Wide publicity is being given to the RUCO (Repurpose Used Cooking Oil) initiative  by the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to make India “Swachh”  by conversion of used cooking oil, which otherwise would be disposed off in drains, cause spillages/ environmental damage and pose health hazards. Chairman IOCL Shri Sanjiv Singh was also present on the occasion. Similar initiatives are being launched at various places in the country.



The publicity involves wide social media campaign to spread awareness and educate people about the ill effects of used cooking oil and ways to dispose it off for converting it to biodiesel. The publicity vans will also carry the poster messages across 100 cities to spread the awareness. This awareness initiative of the OMCs would be a continuous process in coming days.



Oil Marketing Companies (IOC, BPC & HPC), under the aegis of Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, have floated Expression of Interest (EOI)  across 100 cities of India (details available at https://bpcleproc.in/EPROC/) for supply of Bio-diesel produced from Used Cooking Oil (UCO). The EOI was floated on 10th August 2019 on the occasion of World Bio-fuel day. The EOI on Bio-Diesel from UCO provides that the entrepreneurs setting up Biodiesel plants get remunerative price and assurance of complete off take of production by the Oil companies.

The consumption of Used Cooking Oil (UCO) poses adverse health effects. During frying, several properties of cooking oil are altered and Total Polar Compounds (TPC) are formed on repeated frying. The toxicity of these compounds is associated with several diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, liver diseases. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the quality of vegetable oils during frying. Also disposal of UCO in drains causes ecological damage and is an environment concern.

In order to safeguard consumer health, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has fixed a limit for Total Polar Compounds at 25 percent beyond which the vegetable oil shall not be used for cooking. Repurpose Used Cooking Oil (RUCO), launched by FSSAI, provides an ecosystem that will enable the collection and conversion of UCO to biodiesel.

Consumers can give their Used Cooking Oil to authorised aggregators of Used Cooking Oil who will in turn give it to the Biodiesel Manufactures for production of Biodiesel which will be used for blending with Diesel. The details of the RUCO oil aggregators is available at website https://fssai.gov.in/ruco/collection-point.php

                Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (I/C) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri RK Singh inaugurated the ‘Conference of Power and Renewable Energy Ministers of States and UTs’ at Tent City, Narmada, Gujarat today. The two-day Conference is being attended by the Energy Ministers and top officials of energy departments of the States. This is the first such conference after achieving near universal household electrification under Saubhagya scheme wherein 26.6 million households were connected in a record time of 16-17 months.

Inaugurating the Conference, Union Power Minister paid homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and said that country is indebted to him for unifying over 500 princely states into one nation. Talking about power sector, he said that India can not become a developed country without a sustainable and viable power sector which supplies 24/7 power for all.

“We have to make sure that Indian power sector attracts investments. That would happen only when there is Ease of Doing Business and sanctity of contracts is not violated.” said Shri Singh. He also stressed upon the need for timely payments by Discoms to the power generators. 

Highlighting the need to make power prices competitive and affordable, the Minister said that common man should not be forced to bear the burden of system’s inefficiencies. He also stressed upon the consumers’ right for quality service.

To reduce power losses and to increase billing and collection efficiency, the Minister reiterated his vison to switch over to smart prepaid metering. “Smart prepaid meters are pro-poor as consumer is not forced to pay whole month’s bill at one go. Also, it increases ease of bill payments and minimizes the chances of power theft”, said Shri Singh highlighting the benefits of smart prepaid meters. He urged all States to install these meters in all government departments on priority basis. 

Talking of climate change, the Minister said that it has become a major concern world over and India is committed to fight climate change in every possible way. Mentioning KUSUM scheme, he said that it would solarize agriculture pumps in coming years. This will not only reduce States’ subsidy burden but also benefit farmers who will sell surplus power to government. It’ll also incentivize farmers to use groundwater judiciously and save electricity as they’ll be able earn money by selling the spare electricity to government, the Minister added.

Addressing the Conference, Secretary, Power, Shri Subhash Chandra Garg welcomed all delegates and highlighted key issues that would be deliberated upon in coming two days.

In his inaugural address, Secretary, MNRE, Shri Anand Kumar said that for India climate change has been a matter of faith and commitment. He expressed confidence that India would achieve the target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity well before the deadline of December, 2022. He also mentioned the new ambitious target of 450 GW announced by the Prime Minister in his UN speech. On the contentious issue of revisiting PPAs, the Secretary said that PPAs once signed should not be revisited unless there is a provision to this fact in the PPA itself or there is a malafied case of corruption.

The Conference being held on 11- 12 October, 2019 will see deliberation over a range of issues pertaining to power and renewable energy sector such as – 24/7 power supply for all, Ease of doing business, Sanctity of contracts, regulatory issues, implementation of various schemes e.g. PM-KUSUM, SRISTI, DDUGJY, IPDS, setting up of Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Parks, transmission, energy conservation etc.

Seventh Annual Integrated Rating of State Distribution Utilities for FY 2017-18 released – 

The inauguration of the Conference also saw the release of Seventh Annual Integrated Rating of State Distribution Utilities by the Union Power Minister. 41 utilities from 22 States have been rated in this ranking, out of which seven Utilities have been given A+ rating. A total of 20 Utilities have been upgraded this year as compared to last year. 

Integrated Rating of State Distribution Utilities is an annual exercise carried out since 2012 by the Ministry of Power, Govt. of India. Power Finance Corporation (PFC) a PSU under the Ministry of Power is coordinating agency for the rating exercise. PFC has appointed ICRA and CARE as the designated credit rating agencies for carrying out the rating exercise.

                In a major decision to give a boost to Electric Vehicles in country, Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri RK Singh has approved amendments in Electric Vehicle Charging Guidelines and Specifications. These Revised Guidelines and Specifications for charging infrastructure shall supersede the earlier guidelines and standards issued by the Ministry of Power on 14.12.2018.

Speaking about the decision, Power Minister Shri RK Singh said that revised guidelines are more consumer friendly as they incorporate a number of suggestions received from various stakeholders. “We have tried to address the concerns of EV owners in new guidelines” he said and expressed hope that revised guidelines will encourage faster adoption of EVs in India. 

In order to address the range of issues of the Electric Vehicle Owners, a phase-wise installation of an appropriate network of Charging Infrastructure throughout the country has been envisaged in the Guidelines ensuring that at least one Charging Station should be available in a grid of 3 Km X 3 Km in the cities and one Charging Station at every 25 Km on both sides of highways/roads. It has been envisaged that in the first phase (i.e. 1-3 years) all Mega Cities with population of 4 million plus as per census 2011, all existing expressways connected to these Mega Cities & important Highways connected with each of these Mega Cities may be taken up for coverage, while in the second phase (3-5 years) big cities like State Capitals, UT headquarters may be covered for distributed and demonstrative effect. Further, important Highways connected with each of these Mega Cities may also be taken up for coverage. To address the concerns in inter-city travel and long range and/or heavy duty EVs it has been provided that Fast Charging Station for long range and/or heavy duty EVs like buses/trucks etc., shall be installed at every 100 Kms, shall be installed one on each side of the highways/road located preferably within/alongside the Public Charging Station (PCS) mentioned above.

The above density/distance requirements shall be used by the concerned state/UT Governments/their Agencies for the land use planning for public charging stations as well as for priority in installation of distribution network including transformers/feeders etc by the DISCOMs. This shall be done in all cases including where no central/state subsidy is provided.

 Assuming that most of the charging of EVs would take place at homes or at offices where the decision of using Fast or Slow chargers would rest on the consumers, it has been clarified in the guidelines that private charging at residences/offices shall be permitted and DISCOMs may facilitate the same. 

  As far as the Public Charging Stations (PCS) are concerned, it has already been clarified by Ministry of Power that setting up of PCS shall be a de-licensed activity and any individual/entity is free to set up public charging stations, which has also been reiterated in the guidelines, subject to the conditions as specified in the Guidelines. Further, the guidelines specifies the type of chargers of different standards (viz. CCS, CHAdeMO, Type-2 AC, Bharat AC 001) thus ensuring that the PCS owners have the freedom to install the chargers as per the market requirement. To keep the PCS technology agnostic, it has been provided that any other fast/slow/moderate charger as per approved DST/BIS standards whenever notified can also be installed at the PCS. Thus, the Guidelines provide an extensive flexibility while ensuring a democratic choice to both EV owners and PCS providers to install the type and number of chargers.

Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), a statutory body under Ministry of Power has been nominated as the Central Nodal Agency. Further a provision for State Nodal Agency for the respective states has been provided for in the Guidelines. The roles of the respective Nodal Agencies have been specified. These Nodal Agencies will act as the key facilitator in installation of Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles throughout the country.

The tariff to be charged, from Public Charging Stations as well as from domestic consumers for domestic charging, by the DISCOMs and the Service Charges to be charged by these PCS from EV users have also been covered in the guidelines. It has been provided that the domestic charging shall be akin to domestic consumption of electricity and shall be charged as such. However, in case of PCS, it has been provided that tariff for the supply of electricity to PCS shall be determined by the appropriate commission in accordance with the Tariff policy issued under section 3 of Electricity Act 2003, as amended from time to time. As far as the Service Chargers at PCS are concerned, while it has been clarified that charging of EV is a service, to ensure that the incentives (financial or otherwise) provided to PCS owners in installation of charging stations are transferred to the EV owners, it has been provided that the appropriate agency/commission shall fix the ceiling of Service Charges in such cases.

                The Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri RK Singh and the Union Minister for Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Pralhad Joshi jointly launched PRAKASH (Power Rail Koyla Availability through Supply Harmony) portal here today. The Portal aims at bringing better coordination for coal supplies among all stakeholders viz - Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Coal India, Railways and power utilities. This is an important step in ensuring adequate availability and optimum utilization of coal at thermal power plants.

The Portal is designed to help in mapping and monitoring entire coal supply chain for power plants, viz – 


	Coal Stock at supply end (mines), 
	coal quantities/ rakes planned, 
	coal quantity in transit and 
	coal availability at power generating station.


Speaking at the launch of the Portal, Power Minister Shri RK Singh said that it would help in better planning. He also expressed hope that, “The Portal will evolve with time as we learn from it.” Union Minister Shri Pralhad Joshi congratulated all stakeholders for the launch of portal and assured of all support by the Ministry of Coal.

Benefits of Portal to the Stakeholders

The portal makes available following information on a single platform -


	Coal company will be able to track stocks and the coal requirement at power stations for effective production planning
	Indian Railways will plan to place the rakes as per actual coal available at siding and stock available at power stations.
	Power stations can plan future schedule by knowing rakes in pipe line and expected time to Reach.
	Stock at power generating station
	Ministry of Power /Ministry of Coal/ CEA/ POSOCO can review overall availability of coal at thermal power plants in different regions


Present mechanism to review coal supply situation consists of an inter-ministerial group which has officials from Ministries of Power, Coal, Railways, CEA, power utilities and coal companies. This group holds weekly meetings to review coal supply situation as well as railway logistics. It was observed that this mechanism faced several issues such as scattered information, correctness of data from different organizations, timely availability of data etc. This often led to difficulties in decision making 

To address such situations, Ministry of Power asked CEA for establishment of a transparent mechanism to monitor the coal availability at loading site (CIL,SCCL), placement of rakes by Railways (CRIS) and availability of coal at power stations (NTPC / DVC /State utilities) and also directed NTPC to facilitate CEA for portal development.

PRAKASH Portal is developed by NTPC and sources data from different stakeholders such as Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Centre for Railway Information System (CRIS) and coal companies. All reports are available in PDF/Excel format. However, to present information in a user friendly method, the Portal gives graphical representation of reports with details shown on the map of India.

Currently, the Portal will make available four reports as detailed below -  


	Daily Power Plant Status



	This report gives Station data related to power generation, coal receipt, consumption and stock. 
	Report can be generated utility wise, state wise and sector wise (default utility-wise). 


 


	Periodic Power Plant Status



	Report gives Station data related to power generation, coal receipt, consumption and stock for selected period. 
	Coal materialisation based on dispatch by coal company is available.                       



	Plant Exception Report



	This report gives materialisation and rakes in pipeline through Rail.



	Coal Dispatch Report



	Report gives coal subsidiary wise dispatch for particular period.
	It also gives source wise details of coal dispatch. 
	Dispatch trend is also shown.
	Plant wise and siding wise details are available.

                Indian Railwaysadopted e-office system to make it paperless, efficient, transparent and expeditious. The implementation of phase-I of NIC e-office suite has been completed ahead of time by RailTel under an MoU with Indian Railways in March 2019 with a mandate to complete the work by March 2020. As of 30.10.2019, RailTel has created 50000+ users in 58 establishments of Indian Railways which have adopted paperless work culture and also trained all the executives to handle the platform. 

 

There is an absolute transparency as anything once written on the file is archived. There is also a monitoring mechanism to check as to where the files are held up.

 

This would enable quick disposal of files and systematic, timely monitoring of pending files. With above advantages, Indian Railways will be changing the work culture for providing better services to public.  e-Office fosters paper-less culture which will not only save operational cost but also reduce the carbon foot print. 

 

e-Officeimplementation is a Mission Mode Project (MMP) under the National e-Governance Programme of the Government of India. The project aims to usher in paperless, more efficient, effective and transparent inter-government and intra-government transactions and processes. NIC e-Office is a cloud enabled software developed by National Informatics centre (NIC) that is being deployed/hosted from RailTel Tier III certified data centres at Secundrabad and Gurgaon.It is based on Central Secretariat Manual of e-Office Procedure (CSMeOP).  Currently 4 modules (File Management System (eFile), Knowledge Management System (KMS) Collaboration & Messaging Services (CAMS) & Personnel Information Management System (PIMS) are part of the e-office system being implemented.

                Indian Railways introduces a new OTP based refund system for tickets booked through authorized railway ticketing agents. This is aimed to bring in a transparent and customer friendly refund system for reserved e-tickets which are cancelled or which are fully waitlisted dropped tickets. This new system will be implemented by Indian Railways PSU, Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC). 

The OTP (One time Password) will be received as SMS on the registered mobile number of the passenger (provided by the customer/passenger to the agent at the time of booking). The customer/passenger will be required to share the OTP with the agent who booked the ticket, for getting the refund amount.

Through this user friendly facility, passenger will come to know about the exact refund amount received by agent on his behalf against cancelled ticket or fully waitlisted dropped ticket. 

The objective of the scheme is to streamline the cancellation refund process further so that cancellation amount is refunded timely to the customer by the agents.

 

Customers are advised:

 


	To provide correct mobile no. of one of the passengers to the IRCTC authorised agent at the time of booking reserved rail e-tickets.  
	To ensure that the agent records   his or her mobile no. correctly at the time of booking reserved rail e-tickets.
	To note that only IRCTC authorised agents are permitted to book reserved rail e-tickets to the customer 
	And to note that OTP based refund for cancelled tickets or fully waitlisted dropped tickets, will be processed only if the ticket is booked through IRCTC authorised agents.

                Several ‘Divyangjan’ and their supporters had staged a sit-in protest near Mandi House in New Delhi since October 23rd, 2019 against perceived irregularities in the filling up of posts reserved for Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) in the recent Level-1 recruitment exercise of the Indian Railways.

Indian Railways had issued a centralized recruitment notification in February 2018 for around 63,000 posts on different Railways. This notification also included posts for persons with benchmark disabilities (PwBD). 

Subsequently, based on the provisions of the revised PwBD Act that mandated 4% reservation for PwBD categories (including newly introduced Multi Disability category), an additional window was notified for candidates to apply. Thereafter a clear 1% distribution of vacancies for each of the four PwBD categories for the recruitment exercise was made increasing the total number of vacancies reserved for PwBD to around 2500.

Complaint of the protesters before the Court of Chief Commissioner For Persons With Disabilities (Divyangjan) was about this revision in the vacancy percentage and specific grievances of some Divyangjan candidates in some Railway zones as regards communication on qualifying marks and calling for Document Verification.

Five written representations in this connection came up for hearing before the Court of Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPWD) on 23rd October 2019. 

A detailed meeting with representatives of the protesters with senior Railway Board officers was also held in the office of Secretary, Ministry of Social Justice on 24-10-2019 to understand the grievances, explain the Railways’ position and actions taken, and assure the protesters that all grievances would be examined and those genuine addressed in a time-bound manner. Indian Railways reiterated its commitment to follow the all extant instructions regarding recruitment of persons with benchmark disabilities (PwBD).

The matter was thereafter heard in the Court of CCPWD on 25-10-2019. 

The qualified PwBD candidates would be appointed as per their merit/turn in their respective Railway zones as per vacancies notified for the different classes of Divyangjan.

Any unfilled vacancies would not be filled by other non-PwBD candidates. 

Position regarding category-wise qualifying marks/cut-offs for each Railway/RRC will be displayed on relevant websites. 

Candidates can give their grievances and it will be examined carefully and expeditiously. The recruitment process is still underway and more PwBD candidates, would come up for appointment in the coming weeks. Under no circumstances will any vacancy for Divyangjan be filled by any other categories. In certain circumstances, where the vacancies of PwBDs are not filled up, the same is carried forward to the next recruitment cycle/notification.

Indian Railways has a clear commitment to recruit Divyangjan against the posts identified for them as per quota prescribed.

In order to improve the punctuality, Railways has taken numerous steps including:


	Rigorous monitoring at Divisional, Zonal and Railway Board levels. 
	Removal of infrastructure bottlenecks in a planned manner.
	Integrated Mega Blocks are planned in such a way that all asset maintenance departments can do their work simultaneously. 
	End to end running of some trains with diesel locomotives to avoid detention on account of loco changing from diesel to electric. 
	Conversion of conventional rakes of Mail/Express trains (Integral Coach Factory rakes) into LHB (Linke Hofmann Busch) rakes. 
	Rationalization of Time Table in order to make a group of similar speed trains. 
	Curtailment of stoppage time at major terminals. 
	Commissioning of 1st phase of Dedicated Freight Corridor. 
	High capacity water pumps at watering stations to minimize detention on this account. 
	Provision of Bye-pass stations to avoid engine reversal etc. 
	Also, for attaining accuracy in punctuality data, the timing of arrival and departures are prominently being captured automatically through data-loggers. It is being monitored through dashboards – called “Rail Drishti” at highest level to promote punctuality.

                Most advanced Electronic Interlocking System has been installed on the Grand Chord route.  The measure is expected to help Indian Railways speed up trains and to achieve its future objective of reducing the travel time between Delhi and Howrah to about 12 hours from the existing 17-19 hours.

Grand Chord is part of the Howrah-Gaya-Delhi line and Howrah-Allahabad-Mumbai line. It acts as a link between Sitarampur, (West Bengal) and Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Junction, Uttar Pradesh, and covers a stretch of 450 kms falling in North Central Railway (NCR) Zone of Indian Railways, which maintains and operates 53% portion of this New Delhi-Howrah route.This achievement become possible by replacement of the 65-year old outdated Mechanical Signaling System with the most advanced and safer Electronic Interlocking System at Tundla station in Uttar Pradesh now.

Around 500 persons worked day and night without break from 2nd September, 2019 to 20th October, 2019 to execute this complex and challenging work in minimum possible time and with minimum inconvenience to public using innovative and out of the box methodologies and meticulous planning.

Tundla Jn. is an important station on this super-saturated route operating 160% of its designed capacity. Tundla also connects mainline with Agra Cantt. Jn. This important Electronic Interlocking work at Tundla Jn. was having 613 route combinations which is only second to Kharagpur in South Eastern Railway with 800 routes.

Despite being extremely important from train operation point of view, Tundla Jn. was still continuing with mechanically interlocked signaling system of 1955 vintage. This system required manual operation of levers for receipt and dispatch of trains from 05 different cabins. Manual operation and coordination among cabins took approximately 05-07 minutes to handle each train at important Jn. station thus limiting its handling capacity to maximum 190-200 train on daily basis. Further Mechanical signaling also required upgrade to match with global safety standards in train operation. Layout of Tundla Jn. also needed important changes to accommodate longer trains and more route combinations for efficient train operations. 

Need for this change was felt a long back ago and work for remodeling and removal of Mechanical signaling was sanctioned way back in 1998-99, however actual execution got delayed due to extreme pressure of train operation at Tundla Jn. station as execution required cancellation of sizable number of trains which was not feasible unless an innovative and out of the box solution to this problem was found by NCR in 2019. 

Realizing the importance of this work, GM, NCR, Sri Rajiv Chaudhry motivated and guided the team of multi-disciplinary team of plannerswho came out with innovative solution to utilize newly constructed eastern dedicated freight corridor section between Bhadhan- Khurja section for diversion of some goods trains bypassing Tundla Jn. thus minimizing cancellation of passenger trains during execution of this work. 

On the historic day of 20th October, 2019, 65 years old Mechanical Signaling system was replaced by the most advanced and safer system of Electronic Interlocking. With commissioning of this system and some post commissioning works expected to be over by 17.11.2019 following major benefits shall be achieved in trains operation:

 


	Train handling time to be reduced from existing 05-07 minutes to 30-60 seconds through centralized power cabin enhancing handling capacity of Jn. to 250 per day from existing 200 maximum, thus less detention of trains outside Tundla and improved Punctuality of Trains.
	Train operation towards Agra will be immensely benefitted with two additional platforms and extension of three existing platforms no. 3,4&5 to cater full length trains on main line. 
	All UP-direction yard lines are now fit for passenger train movement thus efficient handling of more coaching train. 
	Length of Yard lines increased to handle longer freight and passenger trains.
	Double exit facility provided to Medical Relief Train (ARME) for immediate movement in both sides during accidents etc. 
	Centralized fail-safe operation through power cabin by just click of the mouse button replacing cumbersome, inefficient and manual operation spread across 05 cabins. Substantial saving on manpower requirement.


This work will go a long way in improving punctuality of trains on New Delhi- Howrah main lineand benefits shall be manifold during incoming foggy season through safe and detention free handling of trains at Tundla Jn.

                Indian Railways started a pilot project, allowing e-commerce consignments on its EMU services in non-peak hours.  As a part of innovative pilot project, carrying of e-commerce consignment ofAmazon in EMU services commenced from Sealdah to Dankuni in EMU local (suburban services) managed by Eastern Railways. The pilot project is initially for a period of three months where total 7 MT of consignment per day has been allowed to be carried.The rate chargeable is that of Luggage Rate (Scale L – highest scale) i.e. ₹.5537/- per day. This pilot project of booking consignments in EMU service is the first of its kind in Indian Railways.

The consignment is allowed to be carried in vendor compartment alongwith other vendors in non-peak hours (i.e. 11.00 hrs to 16.00 hrs.), thus causing no disruption/inconvenience to the existing system.

This project is to benefit both Railways and e-commerce company M/s. Amazon. Railway will be benefitted through generation of revenue without putting any additional stress or burden on existing system whereas Amazon will be benefitted through reduced transit time.

The route viz. Sealdah to Dankuni was preferred by M/s. Amazon for quick movement of their consignment to the existing facility at Dankuni. Upon success of the pilot project, other routes may also be taken up by Amazon and other  e-commerce companies may also be interested.

He said connectivity to the last man has been the constant focus of Railways and to provide better services to the citizens.

These trains will run on the “Hub and Spoke” Model, thereby facilitating passengers to use these trains to reach the “Hub” for availing onward journey to other major stations. Indian Railways plans to run more trains on similar model to serve the passengers of smaller towns and cities. These measures are also expectedto boost the earnings of the Indian Railways to help in strengthening the economy.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah flagged off the New Delhi-Katra 'Vande Bharat' Express in New Delhi today in presence of Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, Minister of State of Railways, Shri Suresh C. Angadi. Chairman, Railway Board, Shri Vinod Kumar Yadav, other Members of Railway Board and General Manager, Northern Railway were also present on the occasion. This is the second ‘Vande Bharat’ express after the New Delhi - Varanasi semi-high speed train flagged off by Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi in February this year. The coaches of this train are indigenously manufactured at the Chennai Rail coach factory. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Amit Shah congratulated the Ministry of Railways for giving a big gift to the people of the country, in this Navratras. He said that religious tourism has a very important role in the development and progress of Jammu-Kashmir. Every citizen of India has a desire to visit Vaishno devi Temple at least once in the lifetime. From the day he took charge, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi put forward a vision to connect places of religious interest across the country with a safe, efficient and comfortable high-speed railway network. A number of steps have already been taken by the government to facilitate pilgrims to visit the places of their religious interest. The ‘Vande Bharat’ express is one big step in that direction while keeping in mind speed, scale and service as the prime priority, he said. 

Shri Shah said that PM visualises Railways as the lifeline to achieve his vision of a $5 trillion economy. ‘Vande Bharat’ is a hallmark of the success of 'Make in India' and the potential that it holds in giving a boost to the economy. This is evident with the speed at which the development and modernisation of railways is taking place under Shri Modi's leadership, he added. Home Minister said, ""Railways must keep this fast paced development profile going on in full steam and achieve Prime Minister's vision of a $5 trillion economy”. 

Remembering Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th anniversary, Shri Shah said that Bapu gave a philosophy to the world of how to derive simple solutions to the biggest of problems. One such philosophy during the freedom movement was 'Swadeshi' and railways played an integral part in Gandhiji's struggle for freedom by forming a connect with the people of India, he said. Shri Shah expressed pride in saying that this ‘Vande Bharat’ express is totally ‘Swadeshi’ and is at par with the latest rail transport technology across the world. This train is a big tribute that Shri Modi has given to the ideals of Bapu, with his vision of 'Make in India', he added. The Home Minister urged the Railway Minister to chart out the role of Railways in Gandhiji's journey during the freedom struggle, during the 'Gandhi@150' celebrations.

Speaking on the removal of Article 370, Shri Shah said that Article 370 was a roadblock in Jammu-Kashmir's development and its true integration with India. He expressed confidence that after its removal, the evil of terrorism would be completely eliminated from Jammu Kashmir. ""I believe that in the next 10 years, Kashmir would be the leading state on development parameters. The beginning has happened with the flagging off of the Vande Bharat express. It is a big gift from PM Modi to the people of J&K by bringing development in the state and giving a boost to religious tourism there "", he said.

Concluding his address, Shri Shah expressed great satisfaction on the way Railways is getting transformed on the lines of 'Make in India' and making an unprecedented contribution in the growth of the economy. 

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal said that “Today, Vande Bharat is going to be launched between New Delhi to Katra on the auspicious occasion of Navratri in the presence of Hon’ble Home Minister of India, Shri Amit Shah. The blessing of Mata Vaishno Devi will give a thrust to the development of Jammu Kashmir and Vande Bharat is an example of that development which is going to start its journey today.

The Minister announced plans for construction of a new road alignment between Delhi and Katra in Jammu, which will reduce the travel time upto six hours. He said, the new alignment will pass through the states of Haryana and Punjab. He also said that the government is working on a policy for enhancing employment generation in the state through medium and small scale industries like handloom, handicrafts, honey based industries etc.

Speaking on the occasion Dr Jitendra Singh said that this is a unique moment for the country. 66 years ago, Dr Mookerjee was arrested illegally from Lakhanpur, and was taken to Srinagar through Chenani Nashari. Dr Mookerjee was a sitting member of Lok Sabha at that time. The naming of this tunnel after Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee is a tribute to him and coming generations will remember this day in future, said the Minister. He said this is a tribute to the struggle of workers, and redeems Dr Mookerjee’s pledge of ‘Ek Vidhaan, Ek Nishaan, Ek Pradhan.’  He added that the region has seen a lot of development under the Narendra Modi led Government. About 2 dozen bridges have been constructed in Udhampur. There are inter-state bridges and state of the art tunnels, he added.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Shri Nitin Gadkari inaugurated a conference on ‘One Nation One Tag – FASTag’ in New Delhi today, to roll out the process for having a unified electronic system across the country.  The Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Gen. (Retd.) V.K Singh and ministers and senior officials from several states were also present on the occasion. 

Under the National Electronic Toll Collection programme of the Ministry, toll collection at national highways toll plazas is done through RFID based FASTags. However, collection at state highways toll plazas is done either manually or through other tags. This leads to inconvenience for the road users. The Ministry is therefore encouraging states to come onboard FASTag, so that seamless movement of transport can be assured across the nation. For this, Scheme Guidelines for Inclusion of Sate/ City Toll Plaza under NETC programme (FASTag) was circulated to all states by Indian Highways Management Corp Ltd (IHMCL). The Scheme offers participating state authorities/agencies shorter turnaround time by allowing them to be a part of the robust FASTag solution architecture which already supports approx. 6 million tags with approximately daily 10 lakh transactions. Under the scheme IHMCL is providing financial assistance for 50% of the CAPEX cost of installation of ETC infrastructure at two lanes on each toll plaza subject to a maximum of Rs 20 lakh and also bear part of the ETC programme management fee.

IHMCL exchanged MoUs with several states/ authorities for integrating with FASTag  today. The move assumes special significance due to the fact that from 1st of December this year, toll collections on all National Highways will mandatorily be done through FASTag only. 

Another MoU was signed today – between IHMCL and GST Network (GSTN) for integrating E-Way Bill system with FASTag. This has been done with a view to overcoming the existing challenge in track and trace mechanism for GST E-Way Bill (EWB) System and enhance the efficiency in its monitoring. This integration would become mandatory on an all India basis from April 2020. This will allow for more efficient track and trace system for the GST E-Way Bill System, and check the leakage of revenue at the toll plazas. With this integration revenue authorities will be able to track the goods vehicles to see whether they are actually travelling to the specified destination. The supplier/ transporter will also be able to track their vehicles through SMS alerts generated at each toll plaza. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Gadkari said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been giving a lot of emphasis on large scale transport reforms. He said the  unified and nation-wide inter-operable RFID-based tag for vehicles is a major step in this direction.  Under this system the same FASTag affixed on the windscreen of a vehicle can be used to pay toll across all toll plazas in the country. This initiative will remove bottlenecks and ensure seamless movement of traffic and efficient collection of user fee. He said, this is likely to reduce the nation’s GDP loss by bringing down loss of fuel while waiting at toll plazas. This measure is both time saving, as also controls pollution substantially. The Minister announced that very soon, nobody will be required to wait at toll plazas anywhere in the country. 

The Minister further said that efforts are being carried out to enable usage of FASTag for making various vehicle related payments apart from toll payments, such as fuel payment, parking charges, etc. He said that the FASTag is being positioned as the ‘Aadhaar’ for a vehicle.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Gen. (Retd.) V.K Singh underlined the benefits of ‘One Nation One Tag – FASTag’ scheme. He said, seamless travelling at toll plazas will lead to ease of travelling. He complimented all stake holders for introducing this revolutionary idea, which he said, is going to prove very important in the overall national highways development plan.

At present, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is functioning as the Central Clearing House and 23 Public and Private sector banks are issuing FASTag. A cashback of 2.5% is being offered for the FY 2019-20 in order to incentivize road users for usage of FASTag. FASTag is acceptable across over 490 National Highways toll plazas and selected 39+ State highways toll plazas. More than 6 Million FASTag were issued till last month, with overall cumulative ETC collection of over Rs 12,850 Crore since inception. The total cumulative number of successful ETC transactions carried out is over 5540.67 lakhs as in September 2019.

IHMCL and NHAI have developed the My FASTag mobile App to provide a single one-stop solution to FASTag customers.  The App helps linking of bank neutral FASTag to bank account of customer’s choice. An NHAI Prepaid Wallet was also launched today, giving customers the choice of not linking their FASTag to their bank accounts. Other features of the App include UPI recharge of bank specific FASTag – More than 80% of FASTag issued can be recharged with this facility, single portal for customer login page for issuer banks, Search for nearby Point-of-Sale location by various banks and IHMCL, List of Operational Toll Plazas under NETC programme, and Customer Support Toll-Free numbers.

The conference will see the signing of MoUs with state departments / other agencies for bringing in a unified electronic tolling solution across the country. This would mean enabling the use of the same FASTag affixed on the windscreen of a vehicle at every   toll plaza in the country under jurisdiction of different states /agencies and other entities. This will help provide seamless services to consumers across the country.

Another MoU will be signed tomorrow, between the Indian Highways Management Company Ltd. (IHMCL) and Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) for integration of FASTag with GST E- Way Bill System. The GST Council has already accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for this integration. The integration of EWB system with FASTag will help revenue authorities track the movement of vehicles and ensure that they are travelling to the same destination that the transporter or the trader had specified while generating the e-way bill.

The Minister, along with the MoS, Gen(Retd) V.K.Singh,  held a day long review of the progress of national highways projects at the NHAI headquarters here today, during which he also addressed regional officers through video conferencing. 

Re-emphasizing Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s stress on the need for fast growth of infrastructure, Shri Gadkari said that there is an urgent need to develop a positive, transparent, corruption free working system with time bound decision making.Delayed decisions are totally unacceptable, he said, as they lead tocolossal loss of time and resources, and add to the woes of people. In this regard he also directed regional officers to be proactive in coordinating with district officials to fast track land acquisition and other such issues. 

The Minister also talked about the need to bring down construction costs through new technology and innovative means. He said there is enough availability of funds for construction of national highways through various sources including long term funding from banks. However,in order to improve the economic viability of projects it is necessary to cut down construction costs by employing new materials, innovative technology, and by fast tracking decision making to avoid associated cost  escalation. 

Shri Gadkari also stressed upon the need for performance audit and said that officials must  ensure that the award and construction targets for the year are fully met.

MoS, Gen(Retd) V.K.Singh also addressed the regional officers and called for positive, concerted action from them that was  aimed at fulfilling the targets of the Ministry and the expectations of the people of the country. 

Shri Gadkari also inaugurated NHAI’s GIS based  Plantation Monitoring System that assigns a unique digital address to each sapling planted on a national highway, making it possible to monitor its progress. The Minister also inaugurated NHAI’sonline  TollRemittance Management System today.

                Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has embarked upon a mission for utilising waste plastic in a big way. It has mobilised nearly 26 thousand people across the country for spreading awareness on plastic waste management. Over 61 thousand hours of shramdaan has been given to collect plastic waste. This has resulted in collection of nearly 18 thousand kilograms of waste plastic throughout the country. 

Under the ‘Swachhta Hi Sewa’ programme of the Government of India, it has undertaken awareness generation against use of plastic, through Swachhata Awareness Programme through rallies, putting up posters / banners / slogans, distribution of pamphlets at Toll Plazas and nearby Dhabas, and organizing painting / essay writing competitions in schools. Awareness Programmes are being organised at Camp site / local community centres, publicity through FM Radio, cleaning of National Highways and collection of plastic waste / polythene bags / plastic bottles, cleaning up Toll Plazas, and organizing Swacchata Workshops for truck drivers and toll employees. The ministry is discouraging the use of plastic water bottles, installing dustbins for collection of segregated waste, and is distributing cloth/jute bags.

The Ministry is encouraging the use of waste plastic in highway construction, especially on National Highways within 50 km periphery of urban areas that have a population of 5 lakh or more. A stretch of road has recently been constructed using waste plastic on NH-48 near Dhaula Kuan. A portion of Delhi- Meerut expressway and Gurugram- Sohna road have also been planned for construction, using plastic waste. 

Plastic waste has already been used in wearing courses of National Highways construction on the pilot basis in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The technology used is in compliance  with the guidelines of Indian Roads Congress for the use of waste plastic in Hot Bituminous Mixes in wearing courses. Construction of 1 kilometre of 4-lane highway can help in disposal of approximately 7 tonnes of waste plastic.

                The Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) has conducted Whole Genome Sequencing of 1,008 Indians from different populations across the country. Announcing details of the IndiGen Genome project, the Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Health & Family Welfare, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the whole genome data will be important for building the knowhow, baseline data and indigenous capacity in the emerging area of Precision Medicine.  The outcomes of the IndiGen will have applications in a number of areas including predictive and preventive medicine with faster and efficient diagnosis of rare genetic diseases, he added.

The IndiGen initiative was undertaken by CSIR in April 2019, which was implemented by the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi and CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad. This has enabled benchmarking the scalability of genome sequencing and computational analysis at population scale in a defined timeline. The ability to decode the genetic blueprint of humans through whole genome sequencing will be a major driver for biomedical science. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the benefits of this initiative include epidemiology of genetic diseases to enable cost effective genetic tests, carrier screening applications for expectant couples, enabling efficient diagnosis of heritable cancers and pharmacogenetic tests to prevent adverse drug reactions.



On the occasion, Dr Harsh Vardhan unveiled the IndiGenome card and accompanying IndiGen mobile application that enables participants and clinicians to access clinically actionable information in their genomes.  He emphasized that it ensures privacy and data security, which is vital for personal genomics to be implemented at scale. Dr Harsh Vardhan elaborated that this is being pilot tested in individuals across India and has evinced interest from several Indian commercial organisations.

The outcomes of the IndiGen will be utilized towards understanding the genetic diversity on a population scale, make available genetic variant frequencies for clinical applications and enable genetic epidemiology of diseases. The whole genome data and knowhow for the analysis of largescale genomic data is expected to enable evidence and aid in the development of technologies for clinical and biomedical applications in India. 



 

Director General, CSIR and Secretary, Department for Scientific & Industrial Research, Dr Shekhar C. Mande said that it is important to ensure that India, with its unparalleled human diversity, is adequately represented in terms of genomic data and develops indigenous capacity to generate, maintain, analyze, utilize and communicate large-scale genome data, in a scalable manner. 

 

CSIR has led human genomic sciences in India and has made major contributions in understanding the “Indian Genome Variation”. Pioneering collaborations in genomics has been fostered by CSIR both nationally and internationally. Furthermore, CSIR contributed towards the first personal human genome in India and in understanding ancestral population in India and early migrations that led to what we know today on distinct ethnic groups. CSIR also pioneered the application of genomics in clinical settings in the area of rare genetic diseases in India by means of DNA/Genome based diagnostics and interaction with large number of clinical collaborators.

                The Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Health & Family Welfare, Dr. Harsh Vardhan released “Guidelines for Evaluation of Nanopharmaceuticals in India”, at an event in New Delhi today. 



Dr. Harsh Vardhan informed that these “Guidelines for Evaluation of Nanopharmaceuticals in India” is one of the most important steps for delineating quality, safety and efficacy assessment of the novel nanoformulations. He further added that these guidelines are intended to provide transparent, consistent and predictable regulatory pathways for nanopharmaceuticals in India.

Nanocarrier based targeted drug delivery is an emerging field with introduction of nanopharmaceuticals in the market. These nanoformulations have higher efficacy, lower toxicity and are safer than the conventional drugs. Indian researchers would be facilitated to undertake research in line with the regulatory guidelines and is expected that Industry would be keen to participate from the beginning of the research pipeline towards product development and commercialisation. Further, private investments would also be attracted since these guidelines would strengthen the regulatory system.

The guidelines apply to the nanopharmaceuticals in the form of finished formulation as well as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) of a new molecule or an already approved molecule with altered nanoscale dimensions, properties or phenomenon associated with the application of nanotechnology intended to be used for treatment, in vivo diagnosis, mitigation, cure or prevention of diseases and disorders in humans

The guidelines would facilitate translational research in line with the regulatory requirements. Guidelines will also facilitate the decision making by regulator during clearances to newer products based on nanotechnology and similarly to researchers to get clearance for their products to launch in market. End users will also be benefited by the quality assured anticipated products in the market in accordance to the guidelines.

This document will give impetus to initiate activities for developing safety guidelines for other domains like agri-inputs and agri-products, cosmetics, implantable devices, through interventions of nanotechnology.

The guidelines will pave the way for significant benefits through such cutting edge technology and contribute to the mission on “Affordable Health Care for All”. 

The Guidelines are developed by Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and is an outcome of all concerned Inter-Ministerial efforts coordinated by DBT.

He stated that in the Netherlands experience, India was a partner you could trust and both could work together in areas such as Agriculture and Food Security, Water management and Climate Change. Another area where he felt that the two countries could share their experiences and approach was in terms of Public Private Partnerships.

Her MajestyQueen Maxima of Netherlands also graced the occasion with her presence at the Inaugural session of the Summit.

Speaking at the Inaugural session, Dr. Harsh Vardhan highlighted the shared heritage and common beliefs between both countries that has led to further intensify cooperation and build a sound bilateral relationship. He said “Countries such as ours need to combine forces to seek sustainable answers to pressing global issues. These include poverty, hunger, job creation, energy security, human rights, gender inequality. At the same time we need to work together on climate change, terrorism, and depletion of natural resources”. 

Recalling the centuries old partnership between India and Netherlands, the Minister stated that traditional items of trade between them had given way to more high technology ones. He added that India and the Netherlands were celebrating 10 years of cooperation in Science, Technology and Innovation space, especially in areas such as Urban Water Management, Smart Energy Grids, and anti-microbial resistance, among others. He stated that Netherlands could help India in its quest to double farmers’ income by improving water technology in the farm sector.

TheMinister also emphasized upon the strong interests that both India and the Netherlands have in each other’s economies. He said that Netherlands is India’s 28th largest trading partner globally and 6th largest trading partner from the European Union. Dr. Harsh Vardhan further added that the country has been the gateway for over 20% of all of India’s exports to the European Union. Between 2000 and 2017, the Netherlands invested US Dollars 24.31 billion in India, ranking amongst the top 5 investors in the country. The Minister further informed that India too was amongst the top-5 investors in Netherlands.



Additionally, the Minister informed that India has nurtured over 40,000 startups over the last 5 years, of which about 31 have achieved the Unicorn status. Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated “We have initiated programs like Start-Up India and today we are number 3 in the world in terms of number of start-ups. We wish to nurture this culture further. We are encouraging new solutions based on technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence”.

Ms. Ineke Dezentje Hamming, VP, Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers VNO-NCW in her address noted that the two countries could work together on areas such as dredging, agri and food processing and start-ups among others. She stated that entrepreneurship and technology have no borders and Netherlands was ready to join India in its quest for development.

Professor Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST, stated that India has been using technology to try and achieve its aspirational goals. He was of the view that the days of leap-frogging were long gone and the time was now right to “pole-vault” in the domain of technology and innovation. In this context, he felt that the Netherlands could help India and some key areas of cooperation could include affordable medical science, Big Data, Internet of Things, Water and Food Processing among others.

                During the visit of His Majesty King Willem-Alexander and Her Majesty, Queen Maxima of the Kingdom of the Netherlands a joint launch of the second phase of the Local Treatment of Urban Sewage streams for Healthy Reuse (LOTUS-HR) program was done by the Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Health & Family Welfare Dr. Harsh Vardhan, today. The launch programme was held during the visit of Netherlands King & the Queen to the India-Netherlands water laboratory at the Barapullah drainin Delhi.

 

Announcing the scaling up of LOTUS-HR for treatment of sewage water at a function in New Delhi, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said “Today, we are going to enter into the second phase, wherein 10 thousand L sewage water will be treated per day. Dutch and Indian companies are contributing to the project by sharing their existing technologies and will showcase how one can treat urban waste water into clean water for various purposes.  We are also in the process of emulating this in other projects across the country”.

 

The project was initiated in July 2017 and aims to demonstrate a novel holistic (waste) water management approach that will produce clean water which can be reused for various purposes. The innovative pilot scale modular plant upon commissioning will treat 10,000 L sewage water per day and will showcase a self-sustaining model for the end user.

This pilot scale facility will employ multiple technologies so that the data generated at the pilot scale becomes a tool-box of treatment technologies for replication at other sites in Delhi as well as other parts of India where similar drains exist. The rationale is that the mixing and matching of technologies from this tool-box will depend on the quantity (flow rate) and quality (pollutant load) of drain water, land availability, site accessibility as well as topography.  

The LOTUS-HR project is jointly supported by Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India and Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research /STW, Government of Netherlands.

The visit of their Majesties to the India-Netherlands water laboratory signifies the importance of the on-going collaboration between both countries while further strengthening the collaboration by expanding the activities through second phase of LOTUS-HR project for cleaning up the Barapullah drain.

During their visit to the water laboratory, their Majesties were also informed about collaboration in the area of water technology and witnessed project demonstrations by the involved researchers. Their Majesties also appreciated the numerous initiatives in this regard.

 

 

Wetlab a Design challenge jointly supported by DBT-BIRAC and Netherlands Enterprise Agency is a novel way of competition which provides a unique learning and networking platform for both Indian and Dutch young professionals and students to think differently for innovative ideas to solve India’s urban water challenges and contribute to cleaning up India’s rivers.

The intent of Wetlab is focussed on making best ideas becoming an input for the realisation of the Water Experience Center that may further lead to turning the project site into an attractive center for education and technology demonstration for students, young professionals and creating opportunities for startups.

The Indo-Dutch collaboration aims to pave new ways to create techno entrepreneurship and encourage a sustainable business model to convert sewage water into clean water for healthy re-use.

The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Shri Anil Baijal; Principal Scientific Advisor to GoI, Shri VijayRaghavan; Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, Ms. Renu Swarup and other dignitaries were present at the event.

                In a bid to resolve the crisis of air pollution, the Governnment today launched green firecrackers.Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Health and Family Welfare, Dr. Harsh Vardhan today announced in a Press Conference in New Delhi,that Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) labs have been successful in developing various environment-friendly fireworks such as sound emitting crackers, flowerpots, pencils, chakkar and sparklers. He further pointed out that these fireworks, based on new formulations developed by CSIR, have been manufactured and are available in the Indian market for consumers and sellers. 

 

 

He further informed that due to the ban that had been imposed as per the orders of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, there was a threat of imminent closure of the entire fireworks industry. However, Science has once again come to the rescue of the common man and millions of jobs have been saved due to the interventions made by our scientists.

Dr Harsh Vardhan said, “I am very happy that on one hand we would be using eco-friendly crackers this Deepawali, and, on the other hand our traditional festival celebrations with lights and fire crackers shall remain intact. Millions of homes which are dependent on sale and manufacture of fireworks will also rejoice this festival, thanks to our scientists!”

Dr. Harsh Vardhanalso highlighted that the emissions testing facilities for the new fire crackers have been set up at  CSIR-NEERI  as well as their approved National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration (NABL) facilities whose list is available at CSIR NEERI website. Further, a Raw Materials Compositional Analysis (RACE) facility has been launched in Sivakasi to facilitate manufacturers for testing their raw materials and chemicals. About 530 emissions testing certificates have been issued to fireworks manufactures for new and improved formulations meeting the stipulated guidelines of green crackers. 

 

The Minister also lauded the efforts made by CSIR in developing these green crackers and informed that nearly 165 fireworks manufactures have been roped in and around 65 more manufacturers are in the process of coming on board.

 

 

To develop reduced emission/green fireworks, eight labs participated,CSIR-NEERI, CEERI, IITR, IICT, NCL, CECRI, NBRI and CMERI, with CSIR NEERI coordinating the entire exercise. Firstly, for immediate improvement CSIR-NEERI developed improvements in conventional formulations based on Barium Nitrate to meet the stipulated norms of green crackers. The implementation of these formulations is subject to approval of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. CSIR-NEERI has also developed new formulations for reduced emission light and sound emitting crackers with 30% reduction in particulate matter.

Dr Harsh Vardhan also mentioned that CSIR-NEERI along with Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change (MoEFCC) have also evolved a clear definition of green crackers with a view to educate the regulators and the public on ways and means to demarcate green crackers from conventional crackers. Apart from defining green crackers, baseline values for benchmarking green crackers and assessing Barium levels in conventional crackers and green crackers, have been laid down for legal and policy interventions. 

During the press conference, Dr Harsh Vardhan launched the green crackers manufactured by licensee-manufacturers. He also informed that a green logo as well as a Quick Response (QR) coding system has been developed for differentiation of green crackers from conventional crackers.  QR codes is a novel feature incorporated on the fire crackers to avoid manufacture and sale of counterfeit products. This will also help the consumers to track the cracker using smart phones and other devices. Dr Harsh Vardhan also indicated that the cost of the green crackers is almost same as that of regular crackers. 

Dr Harsh Vardhanfurther  informed that a helpline has been created for any queries related to emission certificates, QR Codes and formulations. The helpline is available at: +918617770964 and +919049598046, or, email at: director@neeri.res.in.

It is noteworthy to mention that Dr Harsh Vardhan had, in 2018, exhorted the Indian scientific community to initiate R&D on environment-friendly fireworks. This was done to address not only the environmental concerns arising from use of existing fireworks but also protect the livelihoods of millions of people engaged in manufacture and sale of fireworks across the country.

The DG of CSIR, DrShekhar C Mande; Director, NEERI, DrRakesh Kumar and Dr. SadhanaRayalu, NEERIwere amongst those present at the Press Conference.

                Kolkata, October 25, 2019

 

 

 

Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Shipping and Chemicals and Fertilizers held a review meeting with the officials of Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) here today. The Minister inaugurated Ease of Doing Business-Implementation of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based Port Access Control System (PACS) at Kolkata Dock System (KDS). Shri Mandaviya also inaugurated CCTV operations at KDS, Rabindra Setu (Howrah Bridge) and dedicated 3 Truck Parking Terminals at KDS. As part of Green Wall Project, the Minister planted a sapling in the premises of KoPT.

 



 

The Minister also inspected CCTV control room and inaugurated Riverfront Tourism Development. He encouraged KoPT to promote river front tourism in Kolkata. On this occasion, Shri Mandaviya stated that cities with ports are very important as they create jobs and bring transport synergy. He congratulated KoPT for serving the Nation for 149 years and suggested to celebrate 150 years of KoPT. He also confirmed that PM has agreed to participate in KoPT’s 150 years celebration. The Minister later visited Maritime Archive and suggested KoPT to upgrade it further to make the new generation aware of Maritime history in the country. Shri Mandaviya also gave away Swachhta awards to the employees and complemented the KoPT for the campaign. Congratulating the winners, the Minister said, we must inculcate the habit to make our surroundings including homes and officers clean and to make the country healthy by stopping single use plastic which has already been banned. He also distributed steel water bottles among the employees and encouraged them to make the country plastic-free.

 

For secure and systematic entry and exit of vehicles and visitors in Kolkata Dock System (NSD and KPD) and for ease of doing business with Port users, the project of RFID-based Port Access Control System (PACS) was undertaken for Kolkata Dock System (Netaji Subhas Dock, NSD and Kidderpore Dock, KPD) at a total cost of around 17 Crore. Under this project, 12 gates of NSD and KPD are equipped with RFID based PACS system. RFID devices have been installed at all gates of NSD and will go live today. All gates of KPD will also go live by 31.10.2019.

 



 

RFID based Port Access Control System (PACS) will provide single window system to the Port users for obtaining permit/ pass through 100% cashless transaction. The operational efficiency of KDS will also be increased due to system driven gate operation. To ease out road congestion near the port, Kolkata Port has developed 30,000 sq.m of its own land at Sonai, Coal Dock Road and Bhutghat into 3 truck parking terminals at an approximate cost of Rs. 6 crore. These will cater to approximately 400 trucks/trailers.

                The Ministry of Shipping is working on a plan to develop a National Grid for Ports based on synergy between the Major and Minor ports in the country. Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, MoS (I/C) for Shipping and MoS Chemical and Fertilizers announced this while addressing the media after the 17th Meeting of Maritime States Development Council (MSDC)  in New Delhi today. The Minister said that there are 204 Minor ports in the country, of which only 44 are currently functional. All these ports have been centres of maritime activity in the past, and if revived, they can once again become important centres of sea trade. Shri Mandaviya said that the Government is looking at developing synergy between the Major and Minor ports so that together they can bring port led development in the country.

Shri Mandaviya said that a development plan for ports and National Port Grid will be ready within six months. Extensive study will be done for revival of each port, identifying the specific cargo linked to it and the downstream industry. The Centre will share the study findings with the states so that the non-functional minor ports can be developed and made functional. The Minister called for greater cooperation between the centre and the states to develop the maritime sector.

Shri Mandaviya also said that the coastal shipping and inland waterways sector are poised to play a vital role in the development of the country. The cost effective and pollution free water transport can reduce logistics costs in the country, making Indian goods more competitive in the global markets, he said. 

The Minister further said that the Ministry of Shipping is planning expansion of port capacity through the implementation of well-conceived infrastructure development projects, increasing the efficiency of port operations through the implementation of a package of recommendations to cut time and cost, digitization of processes to reduce and finally eliminate human interface and to strongly address environment related concerns. 

He further informed that the conference discussed issues like developing common and comprehensive guidelines for inland waterways barges so that barges of different states can move seamlessly in costal waters.  

Port security was another issue that was discussed at length. This included security of both major and minor ports. Shri Mandaviya said that international levels of security would be ensured at every port in the country.

The Minister also laid emphasis on the advent of cruise tourism in India and the importance of SEZs being developed at JNPT and Smart Industrial Port Cities at Kandla and Paradip. He also said that establishment of research based institutes like CEMS, CICMT at IIT, Kharagpur and NTCPWC, IIT, Madras will help the maritime industry to get indigenous research and skilled manpower.

                Shri Mansukh Mandavia, MoS(I/C)  Shipping has said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's  foreign policy initiative  regarding use of Chattogram and Mongla Ports in Bangladesh for movement of goods to and from India will bring revolutionary cost-cutting in  shipments to and from the North Eastern States. 

During the official visit of H.E Sheikh Hasina ,Prime Minister of People`s Republic of Bangladesh to India , a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) wherein Bangladesh allowed the use of its Chattogram and Mongla Ports for movement of goods to and from India through its territory was signed and exchanged  by India and Bangladesh before the Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh on 5.10.2019 . The SOP on use of Chattogram and Mongla ports has been finalized after the two countries signed an MOU on 6.6.2015 and an Agreement on 25.10.18.

The agreement and SOP permit the movement of goods in Bangladesh through waterways, rail, road or multi-modal transport. Eight routes are provided under the Agreement which would enable access of North East Region (NER) via Bangladesh. The routes are: 


	Chattogram/Mongla Port to Agartala (Tripura) via Akhura
	Chattogram/Mongla Port to Dawki (Meghalaya) via Tamabil
	Chattogram/Mongla Port to Sutarkandi (Assam) via Sheola
	Chattogram/Mongla Port to Srimantpur (Tripura) via Bibirbazar


(and vice versa)

 

The conclusion of the SOP on Chattogram and  Mongla ports  would reduce distance, time and logistic cost for transport of goods and is a win win situation for both the economies. 

Three landlocked states of India viz. Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura will get access to open sea trade routes from Chattogram and Mongla ports via Indian ports. Tripura will be connected to Chattogram Port through the Maitree Setu on Feni river at Sabroom in South Tripura and Ramgarh in Bangladesh. While Agartala is 135 kms from Sabroom, Chattogram port is 75 kms from Sabroom.

Cargo transportation through IBP waterway route from Kolkata/ Haldia to North East is limited to 2000 ton vessels. Now, larger ships carrying cargo destined for North East can call at Chattogram and Mongla ports thereby increasing trade volumes and reducing logistic costs. 

The expected cargo to North East is construction material, iron & steel, fertilizer,  consumer goods, POL, cement etc. Foodgrains, fruits, organic products, tea, fish, jute etc are the cargo expected to be transported from the North East to various parts of India through Chattogram and Mongla ports.

On shipping and maritime affairs, India and Bangladesh have had very close cooperation in the last few years. Under the Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade, in addition to the five Ports of Call (POC), Dhubri (India) and Pangaon (Bangladesh) have been added and both countries have agreed to add for more POCs  in each country. Dredging has commenced under an MOU signed by the two countries on development of fairway in selected stretches of Bangladesh waterways with Government of India bearing 80 % of the project expenditure and the balance by Govt. of Bangladesh.  Cruise services have also commenced between the two countries promoting people to people contact after an MOU and SOP were signed.

 
One major collaboration with Bangladesh will bring in a revolutionary cost-cutting in the shipments to and from the North Eastern States. The agreement is to use Chattogram & Mongla ports of Bangladesh for shipments which will drastically reduce the transportation costs 1/3 pic.twitter.com/h94GTxcvqu— Mansukh Mandaviya (@mansukhmandviya) October 7, 2019




For example, Bamboo production in the NE states is huge, but still, Bamboo was imported from other countries due to low shipment costs. With the new costal shipping agreement, it is expected that the Bamboo industry in NE states will compete with imported products. 3/3 pic.twitter.com/mZMrEH3zwY— Mansukh Mandaviya (@mansukhmandviya) October 7, 2019

	DGT's Dual System of Training gets a boost to practical training through a scheme revamp; New scheme started admissions in August


In the six months since its revamp by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), the Dual System of Training (DST) has had a significant impact on the skilling ecosystem by partnering with 719 corporates and private partners for training programs. This is a huge jump from the 136 MoUs that were signed in the three years prior to the revamp. Interestingly, NSTI Noida alone has signed 37 of the over 700 MoUs in the past few months.

The DSTscheme was introduced in 2016 with the objective of enabling industries and establishments to partner with the Government and Private ITIs for conducting training programmes towards fulfilling skilled manpower requirements. "">With this aim, 719 Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) have been signed with the partners for training programs.The DST combines theoretical training from ITIs and practical training from Industry partners thereby strengthening industry linkages and providing hands-on experience to students on industries latest technologies and techniques.

The revised scheme guidelines were issued in January 2019 and are much more relaxed with greater adaptability towards industry requirements and with wider coverage of ITIs. Under the DST scheme, training is impartedto meet the industry’s skilled workforce requirements.After the training, trainees are awarded National Trade Certificate (NTC) that give them an edge with regard to employability. 

Among the changes in the revamped scheme, ITI&NSTI principals can now directly sign MoUs with industry without interference of DGT or states.The eligibility criteria for industry participation has been eased where now an engineering trades industry can have a minimum of 40 employees instead of the earlier 200, while the minimum turnover requirement has been brought down to Rs. 1 crore per year for the past three years, against the earlier Rs. 10 crore. The duration of the practical training portion of the course has also been made flexible and adaptive to the industry schedule. All the 138 plus courses under CTS have been brought under the ambit of DST, as against only 17 courses earlier. ITIs are exclusively permitted to conduct training under DST with deemed affiliation in the 3rd shift.

	22 MoUs with Third Party Aggregators (TPAs) signed so far to promote apprenticeship among the youth 
	Over 50 workshops conducted across 22 states under Apprenticeship Pakhwada 2019


 

 The 15-day Apprenticeship Pakhwada, that saw State Governments and the industry come together for a commitment of 7 lakh apprentices in the current fiscal, ended in a grand closing ceremony in the capital today. Shri Nitin Gadkari, Hon’ble Minister of Road Transport and Highways and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises was the Chief Guest of the closing ceremony along with Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Hon’ble Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. 

The number of apprentices will have almost doubled after the 15-day Pakhwada. In 2016, the Government had introduced comprehensive reforms to the Apprenticeship Act, 1961, a move that saw about 7.5 lakh apprentices engaged in a span of two-and-a-half years. 

 

In the 15 days of the Pakhwada, the industry has committed to engage 4.5 lakh more apprentices with States committing another 2.5 lakh apprentices. MSDE pledged Rs. 560 crore to State Governments to promote demand-driven and industry-linked skill development and signed 22 MoUs with various states through Third Party Aggregators (TPAs). 

As many as 8 PSUs including Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL), Cochin Shipyard, Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL), Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), International Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO), Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) committed to train about 35,000 apprentices. Additionally, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) signed an MoU with NSTI Mumbai to train solar technicians for sustainable energy sector.

Third-party aggregators (TPAs) and Sectors Skill Councils (SSCs) organized workshops and conferences, with the support of industry and state governments, across the country.

Addressing the gathering at the closing ceremony, Shri Nitin Gadkari, Hon’ble Minister of Road Transport and Highways and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, said it was important to build skilling capabilities for both urban and rural areas. “It is important to understand and map the demand for skilling programs in SME cluster associations in growth areas and industries, especially in the rural, agricultural and tribal areas of the country. The MSME sector has enormous scope for growth and a great need of skilled manpower for sericulture, horticulture, tribal arts and paintings, honey, bamboo, etc, sectors that have great potential of becoming export strengths for the country. In fact, we need to reduce our dependence on imports and move towards growing skills in traditional skills that will inch us closer to realizing the ambition of creating a five-trillion dollar economy.”

Lauding the initiative to launch the Pakhwada, he added, “Technology, innovation, research and skill go hand in hand and always bring great value. The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises will need all the support from the Skill Development Ministry in meeting the demand of its industries. Our efforts should be directed at converting knowledge and skill into wealth.” 

Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Hon’ble Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, said, ““Apprenticeship can provide hands-on training to candidates and provide a better industry exposure to help them gain confidence in a working environment. New job roles will need new skill sets and it is therefore important to inspire the youth to equip themselves with industry-relevant skill sets.”

“We are training all our energies in creating a demand-driven model that caters to both industry needs as well as the youth to enable them with the skills necessary for jobs of the future. Together we must all pledge to make apprenticeship a pathway for the creation of a strong and stable workforce, which is extremely important for India to become the five-trillion dollar economy that we have set our sights on,” he added, emphasizing the Prime Minister’s vision of taking the country on the road to growth.

On September 30, 2019, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Hon’ble Minister of Skill Development and entrepreneurship, had launched the Apprenticeship Pakhwada in Delhi, announcing the need to promote awareness about apprenticeship training among establishments and employers across manufacturing and service sectors. Many significant reforms were announced including a stipend to apprentices between Rs. 5000 and Rs. 9000. The National Apprenticeship Programme plays an important role in upskilling India’s workforce, offering different parties the opportunity to share costs. 

Strengthening the Skill India Mission,NSDC, under the aegis of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship has been collaborating with various stakeholders including industry, institutions, training providers and SSCs to empower and train youth with employable skills.

The youth of the city and nearing areas have some great potential and commitment to exploring a path to growth for themselves. We assure that the Government will extend the best possible means to empower them as the most skilled workforce.”

	Fellows in the two-year blended programme with academic module at IIM-B & district emersion program will train with district administration officials
	Programme aims to provide academic inputs and field experience to understand and contribute to the creation of a district level skill development ecosystem
	Programme launched in 75 districts across Gujarat, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand


 

To boost skill development at the district level, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) today signed a contract with the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Bangalore for introducing a two-year fellowship programme Mahatma Gandhi National Fellowship (MGNF) programme. 

The contract was signed in the presence of Shri R. Subrahmanyam, Secretary, Dept. of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, GoI, Dr. K P Krishnan, Secretary, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship,Shri G Raghuram, Director, IIM, Bangalore, Mr. Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank, and officials from the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, GoI. The program has been developed under the able guidance and leadership of Dr.Mahendra Nath Pandey, Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship; who has given a renewed focus to skill development at the district level, since his joining at the Ministry. 

Designed under Skills Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion (SANKALP) the fellowship aims to address the challenge of non-availability of personnel for implementation of various programmes at national, state and district levels. 

The MGNF programme has an in-built component of on-ground practical experience with the district administration. Launched on a pilot basis in 75 districts across Gujarat, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, eligible fellows for the programme have to be in 21-30 years age-group, have a graduation degree from a recognized university and be citizens of India. Proficiency in official language of state of fieldwork will be mandatory. 

Commenting on the partnership, Dr. KP Krishnan, Secretary, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship,said, “A dearth of individuals who can implement and manage skill development programmes at the grass roots level is a deficit we seek to address with this fellowship programme with IIM Bangalore. MGNF seeks to create a cadre of young individuals and train them in a blended academic programme that provides both academic inputs and a component of field immersion at the district level. Besides allowing for an immersive experience to fellows under the programme, MGNF will also be an attractive proposition for those who wish to eke a career in public policy. It is only fitting that we have launched this programme on the 150th birth centenary of Gandhi ji who was strong believer in decentralized planning.”

“Through this endeavour we are ensuring participation of a larger community for local merit good and we are certain that this program will attract great talent which will further strengthen the skill component at the district administration level,” he further added.

Shri R. Subrahmanyam, Secretary, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, said, “Today, our nation's youth is willing and is anxious to contribute to our nation building exercise and to the society at large. It has to be our effort to ensure that they are given the right opportunities to extend their support. This is a great initiative by MSDE and I am sure that it will see through all the challenges at the district level and come out to be a great outcome based program.”

In the course of their training, fellows will work under the close supervision of state skill development missions (SSDM) and will spend time and effort in understanding skilling challenges and gaps in the district.They are expected to enrich skilling programmes by bringing in fresh thinking to local planning, execution, community interaction and outcome management.Fellows will receive a stipend of Rs. 50,000 in the first year and Rs. 60,000 in the second year. On completion of their engagement, they will be awarded a Certificate in Public Policy and Management from IIM Bangalore.

Shri G Raghuram, Director, IIM, Bangalore, said, ““The Mahatma Gandhi National Fellowship programme is aimed to identify and train a group of young, committed and dynamic individuals, who will leverage the IIMB ecosystem in management, entrepreneurship and public policy and work with the district administration in strengthening the process of skilling to create a vibrant local district economy. Its unique design will allow the Fellows to take academic learning at IIM Bangalore and use it in the field under faculty mentorship with the goal of understanding challenges and barriers that the district ecosystem faces in fostering growth and development.”

Launched by the Government in January 2018, SANKALP is a World Bank loan assisted project that aims to strengthen institutional mechanisms for skill development and increase access to quality and market-relevant training for youth across the country. Four key result areas have been identified under SANKALP viz: (i) Institutional Strengthening; (ii) Quality Assurance; (iii) Inclusion; and (iv) Expanding Skills through PPPs.

                The Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has said that the demand of  steel  in the country has  seen  substantial  increase  and  is  expected  to increase further in the future as India embarks to become a US $ 5 trillion economy. Addressing the Ministerial Meeting of Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity in Tokyo today, Shri Pradhan said India’s demand for Steel shall be a driver of its capacity expansion. “I wish to emphasize that with rapid economic & infrastructural development in India, the demand of  steel  has  seen  substantial  increase  and  is  expected  to increase further in the future as embarks to become a US $ 5 trillion economy by 2024. Furthermore, India is committed to spend about US $ 1.4 trillion on its infrastructure development in the next five years.  All this augurs well for the steel demand in the country.  We are determined to raise the per capita consumption of steel from its current low of 72 kg per capita to 160 kg per capita by 2030. India’s demand for steel shall always be the driver of its capacity expansion”, he said.



On the issue of the steel excess capacity, Shri Pradhan said that steel sector in India is deregulated and is driven by market forces. As it is well known, India does not contribute or suffer from excess capacity. “We are mindful and conscious of the problems, which  originate  from  excess capacity, and thus respect the principles laid down by this forum.”, he added.



On the global situation, the minister said that Steel excess capacity had a devastating effect on the industry globally during the crisis of 2015. After a brief recovery during 2016-18, again, the global steel industry is passing through a difficult phase. Therefore, it is important that we take suitable measures to avoid a repeat of the situation of 2015. He appreciated the members of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity for putting forth considerable effort in the process of information sharing and the review thereof. Shri Pradhan said the members’ willingness to share data on capacity and information on various direct and indirect support measures deserves praise. “This is a unique first-time effort. Information sharing has enabled in formulating better response in terms of improvements for the global steel industry. It also improved our ability to understand the problem of global steel excess capacity.” He called for making concerted efforts to ensure that all actions are in line with fair international trade practices.

 

Shri Pradhan said that the Berlin Ministerial recommended that the market distorting subsidies and support measures which distort competition should be identified and removed. It also advised that Governments must not intervene to create such distortions in the market. He mentioned that Transparency, enhanced communication and cooperation are steps in the right direction. Global Forum may address relevant steel-related issues, as economies are linked intrinsically with this sector. “We all have collective responsibility to address the concerns of the steel sector.”, Shri Pradhan added. 

 

On the sidelines of the meeting, the Minister met the European Union Head of delegation Ms Sandra Gallina, Deputy Director General of Trade, European commission.

                In a step towards ensuring raw material securityand seamless renewal of mining leases allocated to the Government companies, Ministry of Mines has amended the Minerals (Mining) by Government companies rules 2015. It has substituted “may, for reasons to be recorded” in rule 3, in sub-rule (2) and  rule 4, in sub-rule (3) with “shall, for reasons to be recorded”.This implies that for all mining leases for minerals granted to Government companies, the State Government upon an application made to it in this regard by the Government company or corporation at least twelve months prior to the expiry of the mining lease, shallextend the period of the mining lease for further period of upto twenty years at a time. 

Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas &Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan had taken up this issue with Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines, Shri Pralhad Joshi. Soon after assuming charge, Minister Pradhan has taken up raw material security for the Indian steel sector on priority. In another recent order, SAIL has also been allowed to offload in a year up to a quantity equivalent to maximum 25% of total iron ore production in the previous year subject to clearance from the respective State Governments, where the mines are located. 

As per provision of Section 8A(6) of Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 (in short, MMDR Act, 1957), the lease of 31 working mines of iron ore are expiring on 31.03.2020. Recent orders passed by the Ministry of Mines are important steps towards ensuring raw material security for Indian steel industry and effective management of situation in wake of probable disruptions in March 2020. It will also ensure price stabilization of raw materials and will have positive effect on the secondary steel sector.


Lauding the amendment, Shri Pradhan said “It is an important step towards ensuring raw material security for steel PSUs. This will also ensure price stabilization of raw materials and will have positive effect on the secondary steel industry.We are committed to ensuring raw material security for the Indian steel industry”

Textiles Secretary inaugurating the IHGF-Delhi Fair 2019

 

Textiles Secretary, Ravi Capoor, inaugurated the 48th edition of the Indian Handicrafts and Gifts Fair (IHGF) at the India Expo Centre & Mart at Greater Noidatoday. Overseasbuyers from 110 countries are in India to source home, lifestyle, fashion, furniture and textiles products from around 3200 Indian exhibitors who are participating in the Fair that will be on from 16 – 20 October 2019.

 

Textiles Secretary, Ravi Capoor, while speaking at the inaugural ceremony, urged the organisers of the IHGF-Delhi Fair to make all efforts to ensure that next year the Fair attracts over 10,000 exhibitors. He further said that with the skills of Indian artisans and the crafts heritage of India the handicrafts industry has the potential to achieve greater growth for not only the sector but for the artisans and the exporters and increase the handicrafts exports of India to Rs. 100,000 crore from the exiting Rs. 26,590 crore. 

 

Textiles Secretary further said the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts (EPCH) must explore the possibility of opening handicrafts parks in India and develop those parks as tourism and crafts centres. He welcomed the proposal of EPCH for setting up of handicrafts parks for apparel and handlooms and assured the support of the Textiles Ministry for setting up of apparel and handlooms parks by EPCH. Shifting of the production from small organized units to these parks will be beneficial for the small units as it will reduce overhead costs. 

 

He also directed EPCH to include new segments in the IHGF-Delhi Fair for women entrepreneurs and new artisans and also ensure that the handicrafts industry works on a sustainable model where the entire production process will function as a zero waste manufacturing sector.

 


	
		
			
			Director General EPCH, Rakesh Kumar, said that effortsare being made by EPCH for sustainable development and preservation of environment by focusing on reduce, reuse and recycle at this edition of the Fair. Around 50 tonnes waste material like plastic, metal, wood and fabric are being reused to enhance and decorateIHGF-Delhi Fair 2019.

			 

			Director General EPCH further informed that in order to reduce the usage of plastic, the Council has decided to do away with bottled water and instead is offering metal water bottles to the visitors and exhibitors which may be refilled at the water stations spread across the Fair venue. A 3 MW roof top solarenergy panel has been installed in the Fair to minimise carbon emissions.

			 

			The IHGF-Delhi Fair 2019 will have knowledge seminars on various topics by expert faculties, fashion shows and ramp walks by models wearing fashion jewellery, accessories and utility items sourced from exhibitors at the Fair.

			 

			EPCH is a nodal agency for promoting exports of handicrafts from the country to various destinations of the world and projecting India’s image abroad as a reliable supplier of high quality handicrafts goods and services. EPCH has set up Handicrafts Carpet Sector Skill Council which has set up the initiative VRIKSH, the Indian Timber Legality Assessment and Verification Scheme, to establish the chain of custody and legality of the wood which has further been mapped with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. VRIKSH ensures, encourages and supports sustainable development and encourages women entrepreneurs.

India is exporting its handmade carpets to more than 70 countries in the world, mainly to the USA, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, France, Italy and Brazil. Recently, exports have also started to China. 

Germany and other European countries were the traditional markets for export of Indian products followed by USA.  The European markets have been fully developed and have reached saturation point. The Council has envisaged USA, LAC Countries - Brazil, Chile, Argentina, China, Scandinavian Countries - Norway, Sweden & South Africa and Oceania Countries – Australia & New Zealand as thrust countries. 

There is a huge scope of investment in this sectorto setup units to produce carpets and other floor coverings in order to discourage imports and also fulfil domestic requirements. 

Indian Handmade Carpet Industry is highly labour intensive and provides employment to over 20 lakh workers and artisans especially women directly or indirectly in the rural areas. Most of the artisans and weavers employed in this sector are from the weaker section of the society and this trade provides extra and alternate occupation to them at their homes.

Smriti Zubin Irani speaking at World Cotton Day programme in Geneva 

 

Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, said that India remains committed to building on its longstanding development partnership with Africa, especially in the field of cotton. For this, Textiles Minister said that India will be announcing the launch of the second phase of the Cotton Technical Assistance Programme (TAP) for Africa at the Partners Conference in Geneva today. In the five year long second phase, the programme will be scaled up in size and coverage and will be introduced in five additional countries, namely Mali, Ghana, Togo, Zambia and Tanzania. The Cotton TAP programme will now cover 11 African countries including the C4 (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali). India implemented a Technical Assistance Programme (TAP) for cotton in 6 African countries, namely – Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda from 2012 to 2018.

Smriti Zubin Irani further said that India is also engaging meaningfully in providing assistance to strengthen both the agriculture and textile part of the cotton value chain in Africa through training and capacity-building of farmers, scientists, government officials and industry representatives and through the creation of cotton-related infrastructure. 

As one of the world’s largest producers and consumers of cotton, India supports the World Cotton Day as an opportunity to recognise the significance of cotton as a global commodity, and, more importantly, as a source of livelihood for millions of small and marginal farmers in developing countries said Smriti Zubin Irani, at the opening session of World Cotton Day in Geneva today. 

Smriti Zubin Irani said that it is fitting that Mahatma Gandhi has been chosen as the icon for the World Cotton Day and to mark the celebration of the first World Cotton Day, India will gift a replica of Mahatma Gandhi’s Charkha to the WTO.  She also informed that a live demonstration of the Charkha has been arranged a by Pitta Ramulu, National Award winning weaver from India.

The Textiles Minister also informed that cotton farming and the domestic cotton textile industry continue to be important pillars of India’s economy. As a country of 8 million small and marginal cotton farmers, India is sensitive to the challenges faced by the cotton sector in developing countries and India has been a proponent for the elimination of asymmetries and imbalances in the WTO agreements that lead to a distortion of global cotton markets, the Minister added. 

Smriti Zubin Irani expressed hope that the World Cotton Day will help showcase innovative initiatives in the cotton eco-system and channel more development assistance for cotton.

                The Ministry of Textiles, Government of India, is participating in the World Cotton Day being observed from 7th October to 11th October 2019 in Geneva. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is organizing World Cotton Day event in collaboration with the Secretariats of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC). Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, will participate in the plenary session of the event to be attended by heads of states, heads of international organisations and executives from the private sector.

WTO is hosting the event at the request of the Cotton – 4 countries, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali to celebrate their official application for the recognition of 7th October as World Cotton Day by the United Nations.  World Cotton Day will celebrate the many advantages of cotton, from its qualities as a natural fibre, to the benefits people obtain from its production, transformation, trade and consumption. World Cotton Day will also serve to shed light on the challenges faced by cotton economies around the world because cotton is important to least developed, developing and developed economies worldwide. 

Cotton is a global commodity that is produced all over the world and a single tonne of cotton provides year-round employment for five people on average. Cotton is a drought – resistant crop ideal for arid climates, it occupies just 2.1 % of the world’s arable land, yet it meets 27% of the world’s textiles need. In addition to its fibre used in textiles and apparel, food products are also derived from cotton like edible oil and animal feed from the seed. 

The objective of observing October, 7 as World Cotton Day is to give exposure and recognition to cotton and all its stakeholders in production, transformation and trade; to engage donors and beneficiaries and strengthen development assistance for cotton; seek new collaborations with the private sector and investors for the cotton related industries and production in developing countries and promote technological advances, as well as further research and development on cotton.  

The World Cotton Day launch event in Geneva on October 7th is an opportunity for members, the private sector and the international development community to share knowledge and showcase cotton related activities and products. 

There will also be a Partners Conference where development partners will discuss and consolidate support for the new project on cotton by products and for other development initiatives.

There will be a photo contest to encourage photographers around the world to communicate strong and positive messages underlying the importance of the cotton value chain. A fashion event will take place to display cotton fashion and designers from different parts of the world with a special focus on Africa. A cotton exhibition is also being held where TEXPROCIL, Handloom Export Promotion Council (HEPC), Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) and the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) will be setting up their stalls. 

The CCI will be displaying various grades of raw cotton including SUVIN, the finest quality of Extra Long Staple Cotton produced in Tamil Nadu having the highest fibre length. Further, natural coloured cotton that is grown in Dharwad in the state of Karnataka in different colours like dark brown, medium brown, green and cream colours will also be on display. Being naturally coloured there is no need to use synthetic dyes which leads to less toxicity in the fabric when used. 

A sculpture of Mahatma Gandhi made out of cotton will be displayed to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi ji.  

The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) will be displaying India’s high quality cotton textiles at the exhibition. 

At the exhibition HEPC will be displaying hand woven products from prominent clusters of India and will also have a live demonstration of the charkha by Pitta Ramulu, National Awardee weaver. The charkha will be donated to the WTO after the event.  

The India pavilion at the World Cotton Day exhibition is being curated and designed by NIFT, a pioneer institute of fashion education in India. The NIFT exhibition will be an immersive   experience that will bring out the beauty and soul of Indian Textiles with its hand spun and hand woven Khadi. Fabrics which have been given Geographical Indication like Venkatagiri, Chanderi, Maheshwari and Ikkat sarees will be displayed along with many other traditional Indian textiles and organic cotton fabrics. 

The World Cotton Day launch will give more than 30 countries exposure to producers, processors and businesses and more than 400 participants will be celebrating cotton in Geneva with thousand more around the world

World Cotton Day will be celebrated in countries across the globe, with events giving exposure to farmers, processors, researchers and businesses and their contributions to the cotton value chain. These activities will be organised at the country level and livestreamed at the WTO headquarters. 

Between 2011 and 2018, India implemented a Cotton Technical Assistance Programme (Cotton TAP-I) of about USD 2.85 million for seven African countries namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Chad and also Uganda, Malawi and Nigeria. The technical assistance focused on improving the competitiveness of the cotton and cotton-based textiles and apparel industry in these countries through a series of interventions which had significant outcomes leading to a demand for a follow on project.

The Delhi leg of ParyatanParv 2019 concludes  in New Delhi today. The entire Rajpath lawns between Janpath and Rafi Marg came alive during the 5 day  festival which witnessed a colourful array  of Dance, Music and cultural performances from various parts of the country. This was the 3rd edition of ParyatanParv.The idea of ParyatanParv is to propagate the message of ‘DekhoApna Desh’, with the objective to encourage Indians to visit various tourist destinations of the country and also to spread the message of ‘Tourism for All’. This year the ParyatanParv is dedicated to commemoration of 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. The nationwide ParyatanParv 2019 will continue till 13th October 2019.31 stalls of Central government ministries as well as from States and UTs were set up as part of the ParyatanParv in Delhi. 59 food stalls representing cuisines from all over the country were also setup. A multi media exhibition organised by Bureau of Outreach Communication of Ministry of Information& Broadcasting on 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi was one of the key attractions. 



A live food kitchen demonstrated some of the key traditional recipes from the states. In the backdrop of festival of Navratri, around 18 ‘Satvik Food’ stalls were setup to cater to the preferences of all type of visitors. 



As per rough estimates, more than 2.5 lakh persons visited the Paryatan Parv, it saw huge crowd during all 5 day,especially on weekends.

The Tourism Minister Shri Prahlad Singh Patel has said that the ParyatanParv is a multicultural platform to bring out the magnificent diversity of the country and to make people feel motivated to explore various parts of their country.

The respective State Nodal Departments/Implementing agencies need to submit the same at the earliest and also present brief of the activities being undertaken in the Sates w.r.t. implementation of PMVDY. Besides, the remaining States wherever the implementation of PMVDY is yet to initiate, need to take required action and submit VDVK proposals immediately. 

All the all relevant documents, including guidelines, operational procedures, processes involved, proposal formats, business models, FAQs and pre and post sanction activities, etc. relating to the Van Dhan Karyakram have been uploaded on dashboard titled “State Monitoring of Van Dhan” as per the link given: - State Monitoring of Van Dhan – Google Sheets. The above Dashboard has been created to monitor the activities as well as to highlight issues which need redressal. The State Nodal Departments/State Implementing agencies have already been requested to nominate a  nodal person and a team from their end, who could coordinate and update the Van Dhan Dashboard on regular basis.

                The Union Minister of Women and Child Development, Smriti Zubin Irani, chaired the 5th National Council on India’s Nutrition Challenges today in New Delhi.

In her keynote address Women and Child Development (WCD) Minister said that a humane solution has to be developed to tackle the menace of malnutrition in India and for this the economic benefits of investing in nutrition has to be highlighted and propagated. WCD Minister quoted the World Bank Global Nutrition Report - 2018 which says that malnutrition costs India at least USD 10 billion annually in terms of lost productivity, illness and death and is seriously retarding improvements in human development and further reduction of childhood mortality. POSHAN is an exercise for life for all citizens and should not be limited to women and children, she further stated.

WCD Minister informed that the Ministry along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Deendayal Research Institute is developing a POSHAN atlas to map the crops and foodgrains grown in different regions of the country because the solution to tackling malnutrition lies in promoting regional cropping patterns and embracing local food that are rich in protein. 

WCD Minister suggested that in order to acknowledge the unsung heroes of the POSHAN Abhiyaan, who work tirelessly and selflessly for the cause of nutrition like the Aganwadi and ASHA workers, a system of ranking of states on health and nutritional parameters may be developed and for this NITI Aayog may develop a framework for the states to rank districts. Minister further suggested that the process of ranking may involve citizens and civil society.

During the meeting of the Council, presentations were made by the Ministry of WCD, NITI Aayog and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare regarding implementation of the POSHAN Abhiyaan by the states. Discussions took place in detail about the challenges being faced in aspirational districts and in the states that are lagging behind. The need for capacity building and improving the quality of health workers has to take place on war footing so that all Anganwadi workers may be trained in the use of smartphone and other tools to upload the data on the dashboard successfully. Success stories of innovative schemes by states and initiatives to tackle malnutrition were shared during the discussions. It was decided to document all good practices of the states and the innovative schemes that were implemented during the POSHAN Maah observed in September this year. 

WCD Ministry placed before the Council the report of the POSHAN Maah observed in September 2019. During the month long POSHAN Abhiyaan 22 lakh programmes were held and 3.66 crore activities were organised in different parts of the country. Village Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Day (VHSND) programmes were also organised in 7.86 lakh places.

For the success of POSHAN Maah WCD Minister visited 9 states, met 11 Chief Ministers and Governors, along with officials of the NITI Aayog and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and appealed to them to participate and support the POSHAN Abhiyaan of the Government of India. WCD Minister personally wrote letters to Members of Parliament, Members of Legislative Assemblies, district panchayat presidents and city mayors appealing to them to whole heartedly be a part of the POSHAN Abhiyaan. WCD Ministry also held a workshop to guide the states for the POSHAN Abhiyaan. Regular reviews were held with the State Government officials. WCD Minister held video conferences with District Magistrates of the aspirational districts and she also reviewed the work being done during the POSHAN Maah with states and Union Territories through video conferences.  

The WCD Minister thanked Prime Minister of India for taking up the subject of POSHAN during Maan ki Baat on 25th August 2019 which had a country wide impact. She also thanked all State Governments and District Administration for making the POSHAN Maah a success. However, she stressed that this battle may not be restricted to only one month in a year but has to be fought every day if India has to eradicate the scourge of malnutrition, stunting and wasting.

The 5th National Council on India’s Nutrition Challenges was attended by Secretary WCD, Rabindra Panwar, Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog, Swati Singh, WCD Minister, Uttar Pradesh, Mamta Bhupesh, Minister of WCD, Rajasthan and other senior officials from Ministries of Health and Family Welfare, Agriculture, Drinking Water and Sanitation, Rural Development, Tribal Affairs, Panchayati Raj, Consumer Affairs and Food, Finance, Human Resource Development, Housing and Urban Affairs, Information and Broadcasting and Environment Forest and Climate Change. The Council was also attended by representatives of Indian Council of Medical Research, National Institute of Nutrition, Food Safety & Standards Authority of India, Tata Trust, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and World Bank.

The National Council on India’s Nutrition Challenges is mandated to provide policy directions to address India’s nutritional challenges through a coordinated inter sectoral action; coordinate and review convergence between Ministries; and review programmes for nutrition on a quarterly basis.

Sports Authority of India (SAI) organized a two-day (23,24 Oct) vigilance seminar on the theme,  ‘Preventive Vigilance and Integrity: A way of life’ which was inaugurated by Minister of  State (I/C)Youth Affairs and Sports, Shri. Kiren Rijiju here today. Addressing the inaugural session, which was attended by SAI officials from all over India, the Minister said, “Each of us must maintain the highest level of personal integrity because we are custodians of SAI, and we cannot indulge in activities that harm or undermine this organization.” The minister also pointed out that a system of grading SAI centres on the basis of the level of integrity of officers working there, may also be considered. Welcoming the initiative of the two-day seminar, Shri Rijiju said that being vigilant should be a way of life, and must be observed not just during the Vigilance Awareness Week, but right throughout the year.

 



 

Sports Secretary Shri Radheyshyam Julaniya spoke on “Ethics in Sports” and said ethics and integrity is an individual matter and differs from person to person. Speaking on the difference between personal (one’s belief system) and public integrity (larger public good), he said, “One needs to reach a consensus between what is personal integrity and public integrity.” He added that when there is a conflict between the two, larger public good must prevail.

 

Shri Sandip Pradhan, Director General, Sports Authority of India, Shri Anindo Majumdar, Secretary, Central Vigilance Commission were among the other speakers who addressed a plethora of issues related to integrity at the workplace, including remedial actions to ensure fair procurement of goods and services, which is a critical aspect at all SAI centres.

                Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports has decided to allow national and state sports federations, leagues and clubs to organise sports events in all sporting facilities owned by the government, free of cost in order to further the Fit India Movement and to make playfields and sporting infrastructure accessible, without fee, to all sports persons across the country from 1st November 2019. The sporting facilities will also be accessible free of cost to coaches training athletes who are not part of camps organised in Sports Authority of India centers. The decision was taken with the view that people must have access to playfields and sporting infrastructure so that the culture of playing sport and therefore of fitness, becomes a way of life for Indians.

 

In the first phase, stadiums in Delhi including Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Indira Gandhi Stadium, Major Dhyanchand Stadium and Karni Singh Shooting Range will be opened up for state and national federations to host competitions, tournaments and leagues of all sporting disciplines. The Federations and Leagues will not be charged for use of the facilities in these stadia.

 

The new policy will also allow non-SAI coaches to train their athletes at the stadia without any charge, provided that the coach has a minimum of at least 10 wards under his or her training. Training sessions can be booked by a coach online from November 1 and the coach can charge a reasonable training fee from his or her trainees. Youngsters who aren’t training for any sport professionally will also have access to these stadia and can play a game of their choice by advance online booking against available slots. They w ould have to get their photo identity cards made from Sports Authority of India at nominal cost.

 

Speaking of this first-of-a-kind decision to provide access to government’s sporting infrastructure to federations and the sports persons free of cost, Minister of Youth Affairs & Sports(I/C) Shri Kiren Rijiju said that the Ministry is going all out to promote the Fit India Movement, which has been envisioned by the Honourable Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. He further stated that in India, there aren’t enough playfields where children and those interested in fitness and sports can pursue a sport. The Sports Ministry has at its disposal some of the best sporting infrastructure of the country, and needs to be utilised for the benefit of promoting the sporting culture and ecosystem in the country.The minister said, “ We had a meeting with all NSFs and all of them are very happy with this decision, and some of them have already submitted their plans to host leagues and tournaments in the coming months. The intention of the ministry is to increase use of existing sports infrastructure by 3 times in the next 3 months. I am sure this step will not only promote fitness, but will also prompt more youngsters to compete in sport and help us identify more talent for the country.”

 

To ensure focussed use of the available infrastructure, each stadium is being earmarked for a specific sport. JLN will host football leagues, training and competitions organised by federations, while IG stadium will be earmarked for wrestling, boxing, judo and badminton. Shooting competitions will be hosted at KSSR and hockey and swimming at National Stadium.

 

The All India Football Federation and Hockey India have already charted out a roadmap for conducting a number of leagues and competitions in the next three months. The first league in the calendar is the Khelo India Golden League, underway at JLN, which will see football being played by U-7, U-9 and U-11 boys and girls. Speaking about the initiative of the government to open up its sporting infrastructure for larger public use, Dr. Shaji Prabhakaran, President, Football Delhi, says, “This step taken by the sports ministry will help to popularise the game of football in the Delhi-NCR region in a big way. We are starting with the Khelo India Golden League, and will soon be hosting the Khelo India Group A and Group B division leagues for clubs in Delhi. We would further initiate a holistic coaching programme for children in the age group of 5 years and above at JLN in which, over the next 3 months we expect more than 400 youngsters to participate.”

                Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Kiren Rijiju has called for creating a sports culture in the country. Inaugurating the India Sports Summit, Fitness: $10 bn opportunity here today, he said thatSporting culture has to become a way of life. He called upon the private sector and industry to play a big and active role in promoting fitness in the country. India is aspiring to be a global leader, and we are already doing well in economy, politically, and spiritually. India’s rise will be complete and further consolidated if we become sports power. He said that all the nations who are sporting power, have the sports culture there, and playing games comes naturally to their citizens and children. But in India, this was not true, but now the time has come to change. Desired results can’t be achieved without developing a positive and conducive sports culture.



Shri Rijiju said that 1.3 billion people of the country are its strength. We are craving for results, yet celebrate only the success. But everyone playing game can’tbe part of the national teams. So far, the primary concern of the family has been the financial security of the children, and hence the sports was not being encouraged. But now,Changes are taking place. These can’t be achieved overnight. He said that these are exciting times, as sportspersons have started getting livelihood, recognition and respect because of their achievements. We have to change our outlook. Regressive slogans can’t encourage people to accept sports as a way of life. He said Cricket has become very popular in the country, being played in every nook and corner of the country. The Government didn’t have much role in that, as the Government has a catalyst role only, which it is doing to its best. The sports ministry is doing needful to provide world class facilities to the athletes. He called for high standard of governance in the arena of sports, by the Governments, administrators, federations and industry. The minister said that mediocrity will not be accepted. All the stakeholders have to deliver, results will follow.  Kabbadi has recently become an in-thing, and its players have become celebrities. 

 



Sports Minister said that Prime Minister recently launched the Fit India Movement, and it has become a People’s movement. Recently, on the 150th anniversary of Gandhi Jayanti, there was unprecedented participation of people in plogging, who ran and collected the plastic garbage on the way. He said Prime Minister of the country has direct connect with the citizens, and it is best moment for the country to move ahead. He talked about emphasis on fitness and sports. The minister said that we have to move from curative to preventive mentality, and fitness leads to prevention to a number of disorders and diseases. The World community is looking forward to India, and the government aswell as the indutrsy has to play a pro-active role in it. We have to take fitness programme forward to allthe parts of the country. Talking about the job creation, he said that when the country is moving towards the $5 trillion economy, the sports industry has large scope andprivate sector has an important role to play. He said that People have been taking up sports in a big way. Just imagine, Kashmiri youths taking part in sports activities in a big way will take them away from disruptive ideologies, Shri Rijiju said. 

The Minister called upon the industry to play a big role in promoting the sports culture in the country. He said create space and opportunities for the youth. Some of the private sector companies have world class sports facilities in their area, and are also promoting and harnessing the talent at remote areas. He said that that good ideas for sports promotion can come for anyone, and the government is willing to accept and implement them. He said the industry has huge responsibility. Thinking aloud, he said why should country be settling for a few medals in international events, why can’tIndia aspire to be among the top medal winners in Olympics, 4 to 8 years down the line.He said when India celebrates its 75th year of independence in 2022, the country should be fit, at least 80% of the countrymen should be fit. Business houses have sports philosophies and facilities- we should all work in unison in utilizing for promoting the sport culture. Let us try to create positivity, and success will follow. 


 Speaking on the occasion, the Sports secretary Shri RadheyshyamJulaniya said that the country is becoming an epicentre of lifestyle diseases. It is high time, we encourage fitness and wellness programmes. He called upon the private sector to play an active role. He said a new beginning can be made if the private sector encourages fitness among its employees and provide facilities and encouragement for all their stakeholders. Shri Julaniya said that the privet sector has the reach, business model and capacity to reach the far-flung areas and to the person on the street, and they must take the message of fitness to all their customers also.

                Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports (I/C) Shri Kiren Rijiju flaged off Fit India Plog Run organised by Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports here today, on the occasion of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi at Indira Gandhi Stadium. He was joined by plogger Ripu Daman, eminent sports persons, students belonging to different schools of Delhi, Doctors, NGOs, and other institutions. Member of parliament Shri Manoj Tiwari was also present on the occasion.



Greeting everybody on the occasion for being part of the Fit India Plog Run, the minister said that the enthusiasm of all sections of the society to join in the initiative towards a fitter, cleaner country is praiseworthy and encouraging. He said the Plog Run is just the beginning of fit India, envisioned by the Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, where everybody is mentally as well as physically fit. If all of us are fit, then only the country will be fit. Shri Rijiju said that the such events are being organized all over the country, and even reports are being received from abroad about such activities. He said that such runs will create awareness among the people of the country. This is not a one-off event, but it is the beginning of the movement, which will continue. He said that that the Fit India movement is a move to make India a great nation. The minister said that today the father of the nation is being remembered, and plogging is a tribute to him and his vision, to bring about cleanliness in all walks of life, as plogging is a combination of picking up wastes (particularly plastics) and jogging.



Nehru Yuva Kendras, NSS centers and government and private institutions across the country are also organising the Plog Run to ensure that fitness and cleanliness become a way of life for people. 

Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a clarion call to the nation, asking every Indian citizen to combine fitness and cleanliness in their lives through Plogging in his Mann Ki Baat address broadcast on 29th September,2019.

                NITI Aayog with Institute for Competitiveness as the knowledge partner released the India Innovation Index (III) 2019. Karnataka is the most innovative major state in India. Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Telangana, Haryana, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh form the remaining top ten major states respectively. The top ten major states are majorly concentrated in southern and western India. Sikkim and Delhi take the top spots among the north- eastern & hill states, and union territories/city states/small states respectively. Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh are the most efficient states in translating inputs into output.



The index was released in the presence of Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog; Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog; Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science; Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology and Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, Secretary, AYUSH.

 

Dr. Rajiv Kumar expressed hope that “the India Innovation Index would create synergies between different stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem and India would shift to competitive good governance.” Shri Amitabh Kant added that “India has a unique opportunity among its myriad challenges to become the innovation leader in the world.” Renu Swarup said, “cluster-based innovation should be leveraged upon as the focal point of competitiveness.” Shri Ashutosh Sharma said, “The index is a great beginning to improve the environment of innovation in the country as it focuses on both the input and output components of the idea.” Shri Vaidya Kotecha said, “The index is a good effort to benchmark the performance of the state with each other and promote competitive federalism.”

The study examines the innovation ecosystem of Indian states and union territories. The aim is to create a holistic tool which can be used by policymakers across the country to identify the challenges to be addressed and strengths to build on when designing the economic growth policies for their regions. The states have been bifurcated into three categories: major states, north-east, and hill states, and union territories/city states/small states. 

 

 

Background:

Recognizing the role of innovation as a key driver of growth and prosperity for India, NITI Aayog with Institute for Competitiveness as the knowledge partner has released the India Innovation Index 2019. The study is an outcome of extensive research and analysis, which looks holistically at the innovation landscape of India by examining the innovation capabilities and performance of Indian states and union territories. The aim is to create a holistic tool which can be used by policymakers across the country to identify the challenges to be addressed and strengths to build on when designing the economic growth policies for their regions.

The index attempts to create an extensive framework for the continual evaluation of the innovation environment of 29 states and seven union territories in India and intends to perform the following three functions- 1) ranking of states and UTs based on their index scores, 2) recognizing opportunities and challenges, and 3) assisting in tailoring governmental policies to foster innovation.

The India Innovation Index 2019 is calculated as the average of the scores of its two dimensions - Enablers and Performance. The Enablers are the factors that underpin innovative capacities, grouped in five pillars: (1) Human Capital, (2) Investment, (3) Knowledge Workers, (4) Business Environment, and (5) Safety and Legal Environment. The Performance dimension captures benefits that a nation derives from the inputs, divided in two pillars: (6) Knowledge Output and (7) Knowledge Diffusion.

The index presents the latest findings and highlights the regional catalysts and caveats for promoting innovation readiness. The Report offers a comprehensive snapshot of the innovation ecosystem of 29 states and seven union territories. It also includes a section on state profiles covering 33 indicators looking at the different facets of innovation in India.

The index shows that the innovation ecosystem of the country is strong in south and western parts of India. In fact, three of the top five major states are from southern India. Delhi and Haryana seem to be an exception to this rule and seem to be doing well on the Index. Thus, there seems to be a west-south and north-east divide across the country. 

The states have been bifurcated into three categories: major states, north-east and hill states, and union territories / city states / small states. Karnataka is the leader in the overall rankings in the category of major states. Karnataka’s number one position in the overall ranking is partly attributed to its top rank in the Performance dimension. It is also among the top performers in Infrastructure, Knowledge Workers, Knowledge Output and Business Environment.

Among the category of major states, Maharashtra performs the best in the dimension of Enablers. This implies that it has the best enabling environment for innovation, even though the state comes in at the third position in the overall innovation index. 

The broad level learnings and some policy imperatives at the national level include increasing the spending on research and development, improving the capability of top rung educational institutions in the country to produce greater innovation outputs. There is also a need for greater coordination and collaboration between the industry and educational institutions for enhancing innovation capability. A collaborative platform consisting of all the stakeholders of innovation - innovators, researchers, and investors from the industry should be developed. This will help in strengthening the industry-academia linkages and will ease the process of technology transfer by providing a platform for innovators to showcase their inventions.

At the state level, broad level key learning includes forming policies at the state level that seek to improve the innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Cluster development programs are also an area in need of greater coordination and can benefit from a more open collaborative approach. Also, the industrial policies at the state level should focus more on innovation. At present only a few policies exist for innovation even in the most innovative states and union territories.

                In a latest initiative to recognize young people as critical drivers of sustainable development, Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), NITI Aayog and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) India on Friday launched Youth Co:Lab which aims at accelerating social entrepreneurship and innovation in young India.

To mark the launch, a Letter of Intent (LOI) was signed between AIM, NITI Aayog and UNDP India. 

Through Youth Co:Lab, young entrepreneurs and innovators will get a chance to connect with governments, mentors, incubators and investors, who will help equip them with entrepreneurial skills. 

The initiative will also convene a series of youth dialogues across several cities such as New Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Mumbai to promote entrepreneurship across India.

AIM and UNDP, as part of UNSDF signed between NITI Aayog and UN India, are collaborating to spread awareness about different issues pertaining to youth, the future of work and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) through Youth Co:Lab.

The first phase of Youth Co:Lab will focus on six SDGs: SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

Sharing his views on the significance of youth led entrepreneurship, Mission Director Ramanan Ramanathan said that “youth entrepreneurship has immense potential benefits and the most significant one is that it creates huge employment opportunities in the country.” 

“With the world’s largest youth population millions in the county are entering the workforce every year, it is critical for India to create a robust employment and entrepreneurship ecosystem,” he added.

Targeted at supporting young people overcome challenges, UNDP and AIM, NITI Aayog will empower young people through innovative development ideas.

In this regard, Youth Co:Lab will convene social innovation challenges at the national and sub-national level, which will invite young people in the age group of 18-29 years and start-ups to showcase their proposed ideas and solutions to tackle some of the region’s biggest social challenges. 

 

They will also get the opportunity to pitch their ideas at UNDP’s regional centre in 2020. 

 

Aspiring entrepreneurs or nascent entrepreneurs (with less than 3 years of experience) can submit their ideas at http://aimapp2.aim.gov.in/youth2019/entry.php  before 4 November, 2019. 

 

Selected applicants will be invited for a national innovation challenge, where each winning start-up will get an opportunity to incubate and strengthen their ideas at the Atal Incubation Centres.

 

Speaking at the launch, Resident Representative, UNDP India Shoko Noda said, that 21st-century challenges can’t be solved with traditional approaches. 

 

“It is essential to position young people front and centre, to solve the region’s most wicked development challenges. We must ensure that they are motivated and excited to learn future skills, particularly leadership, social innovation, entrepreneurship and communication,” she added.

 

About Youth Co:Lab, she said that it is an innovative platform for young people to explore their ideas and potentials, and bring to scale viable solutions, to accelerate India’s progress on the SDGs.

                On the 150th birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, AIM, NITI Aayog’s Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL) and UNICEF India, including Generation Unlimited, have launched ‘The Gandhian Challenge’. This innovation challenge provides a platform for every child across India to ideate innovative solutions for a sustainable India of their dreams, using Gandhi’s principles.

The winners of The Gandhian Challenge will be awarded in New Delhi by NITI Aayog’s Atal Innovation Mission and UNICEF on the occasion of Children’s Day in November. The contest – open for every child in India from 2 October to 20 October – also celebrates 70 years of partnership between Government of India and UNICEF India to enable Every Right for Every Child. 

“Through this partnership, AIM and UNICEF recognize every child’s ability and right to voice their dreams for a world of their choice, following Gandhi's principles. Our aim is to support them to thrive as young innovators and entrepreneurs,” said Mr. R Ramanan, Mission Director AIM. 

The problem statement for the Gandhian Challenge is: “Share your innovative solutions/ideas to create a futuristic and sustainable world of your dreams, following Gandhi's principles.”

Ideas and solutions to the Gandhian Challenge may be expressed through broad categories: Art & Innovation (Letters, poems, painting, videos and photos, among others) and Science, Technology & Innovation (Robotics, IoT, sensors and 3D printers, among others).

All applications must be submitted on the challenge page on https://innovate.mygov.in/the-gandhian-challenge/ , Government of India’s citizen engagement portal. All applications must have an ATL code.  Children in schools without an ATL can obtain the ATL code by visiting or calling the nearest ATL school. The list of nearest ATL schools in every district can also be accessed on the challenge page mentioned above.

“Participation is a core right of every child and enabling their meaningful participation is of critical importance,” said Dr.Yasmin Ali Haque, Representative, UNICEF India. “Challenges like this help us understand children's point of view with a willing to re-examine our own opinions and attitudes, and envisage solutions through a child-rights lens.”

The most innovative, sustainable solutions/ideas will be showcased as a symbol of a larger movement by children taking root in every district of India. Children across India can access to more than 8000 Atal Tinkering Labs across all districts to support their innovative ideas. 

In ATLs, students of class 6th to 12th acquire a problem-solving attitude, develop innovative solutions leveraging technologies like 3D printers, robotics, miniaturised electronics, IOT and programming and DIY kits, with support from teachers and mentors.
