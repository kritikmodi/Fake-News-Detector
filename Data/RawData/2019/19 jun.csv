                Honourable Members,

1.   I am pleased to address the first joint sitting of Parliament after the election of the 17th Lok Sabha, in the year commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. I extend my heartiest congratulations to all newly elected Members of this Lok Sabha. 

2.   More than 61 crore voters of the country set a new record by casting their votes and enhanced the credibility of India’s democracy in the world. People have stood in long queues braving extreme heat to cast their votes. This time, as compared to previous elections, more women have cast their votes and their participation has been almost equal to men. Crores of youth have voted for the first time and played an important role in shaping India’s future. All voters deserve to be congratulated for the success of this election.

3.   I also convey my best wishes to the new Speaker of the Lok Sabha for this new responsibility.

4.   I congratulate the entire team of the Election Commission for successful completion of the world’s largest election. The contribution of employees of several administrative departments and various institutions, as well as the security forces in successful conduct of the electoral process is extremely praiseworthy.

5.   Nearly half of the MPs in this Lok Sabha have been elected for the first time. The election of 78 women MPs which is the highest number in the history of Lok Sabha, presents the picture of a New India.

6.   It is a matter of joy that the reflection of India’s diversity is visible in this joint sitting. People of every age, hailing from villages and cities, belonging to every profession, are members of both the Houses. Many members are associated with social service, many are from the field of agriculture, from business and economic sphere while other members are from the field of education, medical profession which saves the lives of people and legal profession which provides justice to the people. MPs who have made their mark in the world of cinema, art, literature and culture are also present here. I am confident that your unique experiences will contribute to enriching the discussions in Parliament.

Honourable Members,

7.   The people of the country have given a very clear mandate in this election. After assessing the performance of the Government during the first tenure, the people have given even stronger support for the second term. By doing so, the people of the country have given a mandate for continuing uninterrupted and at an accelerated pace the journey of development which started in 2014.

8.   All fellow countrymen are familiar with the atmosphere prevailing in the country before 2014. In order to take the country out of a sense of gloom and instability, the people elected a Government with absolute majority after three decades. Giving the highest regard to that mandate, my Government started to march forward without any discrimination with the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath- Sabka Vikas’, to create a New India.

9.   on January 31st this year, in this very Central Hall, I had said that my Government from the very first day was dedicated to the goal of  improving the lives of all citizens, addressing their problems arising out of mis-governance and providing all basic amenities to the last person standing at the margins of society.  

10. During the last five years, the countrymen have come to believe that the Government is always with them, working to improve their lives and to enhance their Ease of Living. Based on this wealth of people’s trust, a fresh mandate was sought. 

11. People of the country have long waited for the basic amenities of life. But now the conditions are changing. My Government wants to make the people conscious, capable, well-provided and unfettered to such an extent that that they do not feel the “Burden, Force, or Absence” of the Government in their daily life. Empowering every person in the country is the main goal of my Government.

Honourable Members,

12. My Government is committed to that very idea of nation-building, the foundation for which was laid in 2014. While fulfilling the basic needs of the countrymen, now the Government is moving forward towards realising their aspirations of building  a Strong, Safe, Prosperous and All-inclusive India. This journey is inspired by the basic spirit of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas’.

This New India’s vision is motivated by the noble thoughts of Shri Narayana Guru Kerala’s great spiritual figure, social reformer and poet:

 “Jaati-Bhedam Mat-Dwesham AdumIlladey Sarvrum

 Sodar-tvain Vaadunn Matrukasthan Maanit”

That is, an ideal place is one where people live like brothers free from the discrimination of caste and religion.

13. Three weeks ago, on 30th May, immediately after swearing-in the Government has started working towards building a New India. A New India:

       - Where equal opportunities to progress are available to every person;

       - Where life of every person becomes better and their self-esteem is enhanced;

       - Where brotherhood and harmony bind the people with each other;

       - Where the foundation built on our ideals and values becomes stronger; and

       - Where the benefits of development reach every region and the last person standing in the queue.

This New India, will move forward towards that ideal state envisioned by Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore,  where the mind of the people is without fear  and the head is held high with self-esteem. In Gurudev’s words:

 “Chitto Jetha Bhay-Shunno, Uchcho Jetha Shir.”

Honourable Members,

14. It is a matter of pride for every Indian that when our country completes 75 years of independence in 2022, we would have achieved many national goals for building a New India. To pave the way for the golden future of New India, my Government has resolved: 


	On this path of a New India, the rural India will be strong and urban India will also be empowered;
	On this path of a New India, the entrepreneurial India will attain new heights and the dreams of young India will also be fulfilled;
	On this path of a New India, all systems will be transparent and the prestige of honest countrymen will increase further;
	On this path of a New India, infrastructure for the 21st century will be built and all resources for creation of a powerful India will be mobilised.


In the light of these resolutions, in a short period of 21 days, my Government has taken many decisions aimed at the welfare of farmers, soldiers, students, entrepreneurs, women and other sections of society and have also started implementing them. Initiatives have also been taken to enact several new laws.

15. A decision has been taken to increase the income support to farmers who are our Annadaata, by extending the coverage under ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi’, to every farmer in the country. To enable the farmer brothers and sisters who work day and night in their fields to lead a respectable life after attaining the age of 60 years, a ‘Pension Scheme’ for them has also been approved.

16. Livestock is invaluable for farmers. They have to spend a lot of money for treatment of cattle-related diseases. To reduce this expenditure, my Government has also decided to start a special scheme with an allocation of Rs 13,000 crore.

17. For the first time, a Government has taken note of the economic security of small shopkeepers. In the very first meeting of the Cabinet, a separate ‘Pension Scheme’ has been approved for small shopkeepers and retail traders. About 3 crore small shopkeepers in the country will benefit from this scheme.

18. We are all indebted to the soldiers who dedicate themselves to protect the countrymen by sacrificing every joy, every pleasure and every festive occasion. It is our duty to secure the future of children of those who guard the border, and ensure peace and security for everyone. Inspired by this sentiment, the amount of scholarship under the ‘National Defence Fund’ has been increased for the children of our brave soldiers. For the first time, sons and daughters of the State police personnel have also been included in this scholarship.

Honourable Members, 

19.  One of the biggest challenges of the 21st century is – the growing water crisis. Over time, the traditional and effective practices of water conservation in our country are disappearing. Houses have come up over ponds and lakes, and the vanishing water sources have accentuated the water crisis for the poor. In view of the growing impact of Climate Change and Global Warming, water crisis is likely to aggravate further. Today, the need of the hour is that the way the country has shown seriousness about ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’, the same seriousness be shown in ‘Water Conservation and Management’. 

20. We must conserve water for our children and future generations. The creation of the new ‘Ministry of Jalshakti’ is a decisive step in this direction, which will have far-reaching benefits. Through this new Ministry, the systems related to water conservation and management will be made more effective.

21. My Government is fully conscious of the crisis in the drought-hit areas and stands by every affected citizen. With the support of State Governments and Sarpanches at the village level, it is being ensured that farmers are assisted and the scarcity of drinking water is tackled.

22. Strengthening the system and spirit of Co-operative Federalism, my Government is taking the States along to achieve the national goals. Last week, important developmental issues were discussed with the Chief Ministers and a decision was taken to constitute a Committee of Chief Ministers to look into Structural Reforms in the field of agriculture.

Honourable Members, 

23. Only on the foundation of a strong rural economy, it is possible to build a strong national economy. Our farmers are the pillars of rural economy. All possible efforts are being made by the Central Government to provide adequate assistance to the States for agricultural development. 

24. Large scale investments have been made to strengthen rural India. In order to enhance agriculture productivity, an investment of Rs. 25 lakh crore will be made in the coming years. 

25. To double the income of farmers by 2022, several steps have been taken in the last 5 years. Be it the decision to increase the MSP, or approval for 100 percent FDI in food processing; be it completion of the irrigation projects pending for decades or extension of ‘Crop Insurance Scheme’; be it the ‘Soil Health Card’ or 100% Neem coating of urea; my Government has taken many decisions, appreciating such numerous small and big needs of the farmers. The Government has made the agriculture policy both production-centric as well as income-centric.

26. An important link in these efforts is ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi’. Through this, an amount of more than Rs. 12,000 crore has been disbursed to the farmers in just three months. An estimated expenditure of Rs. 90,000 crore is likely to be incurred annually on this scheme since every farmer has now been brought in its ambit. 

27. With the provision of storage for farm produce, the economic security of the farmers is strengthened. Now the storage facility will be provided to the farmers near their village through the ‘Grameen Bhandaran Yojana’. 

28. The benefit of cooperatives in the agriculture sector is being availed by the farmers in the dairy business. In other areas of agriculture also, the target is to create 10,000 new ‘Farmer Producer Organisations’ to benefit the farmers.

29. Today, India is second in the world in fish production. Our country has the potential to attain the first place. There is immense potential for increasing the income of farmers through marine fish industry and inland fisheries. That is why the Government is committed to ‘Neeli Kranti’ which means ‘Blue Revolution’. A separate Department has been constituted for integrated development of fisheries. Similarly, a special fund has been created to develop infrastructure related to fishing industry.

Honourable Members, 

30. We can achieve our constitutional objectives only by liberating the poor families of the country from poverty. During the last five years, the schemes implemented in the country for the welfare of farmers, labourers, divyangjan, tribals and women have achieved wide spread success. Only by empowering the poor can they be rescued from the vicious cycle of poverty. That is why the Government has adopted an approach to empower the poor, deprived and weaker sections through provision of housing, healthcare, essential amenities of life, financial inclusion, education, skill and self-employment. This is in harmony with Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’s concept of Antyodaya.

31. Comprehensive work is underway for the development of
112 ‘Aspirational Districts’ in the country. 1 lakh 15 thousand most backward villages of the country are in these districts. With the development of education and healthcare facilities and infrastructure in these villages, there will be a positive impact on the lives of crores of poor families. 

32. After the success of the world’s largest financial inclusion campaign, in the form of ‘Jan-Dhan Yojana’, my Government is also working to bring the banking services to the doorsteps of the people. In order to ensure that banking services are readily available in every village of the country and in the inaccessible areas of North East, work is being done at a fast pace. About 1.5 lakh post offices in the country are being prepared to provide banking services through ‘India Post Payment Bank’. Our goal is to utilise the postman as a mobile bank to bring banking services to every doorstep.

Honourable Members, 

33. Cost of medical treatment pushes the poor families into financial crisis. In order to protect them from this crisis, world’s biggest healthcare scheme ‘Ayushman Bharat Yojana’ has been implemented, providing ‘Health-Protection-Cover’ to 50 crore poor people. Under this, so far about 26 lakh poor patients have availed treatment in hospitals. In order to provide medicines at affordable rates, 5,300 ‘Jan Aushadhi Kendras’ have also been opened. It is our endeavour to provide medicines at affordable rates to people residing in far-flung areas through these Jan Aushadhi Kendras.

34. The objective is to set up about 1.5 lakh ‘Health and Wellness Centres’ in all rural areas by 2022. So far, about 18,000 such Centres have already been operationalised. 

35. Our countrymen can learn a lot from tribal communities. Our tribal brothers and sisters live in harmony with the environment and nature and maintain a beautiful balance between development and tradition. In New India, every effort will be made to create an inclusive and sensitive system in the interest of tribal communities. Many schemes have been implemented for all-round development of tribal areas. Work is in progress to provide ‘Learning to Earning’ facilities to the youth residing in the forest areas. In tribal dominated areas, ‘Eklavya Model Residential Schools’ are being set up for children. The thrust is on value addition and marketing of forest produce through Van Dhan Kendras.

Honourable Members, 

36. Women Empowerment is one of the top priorities of my Government. Empowerment of women and their effective involvement in society and economy is the touchstone of a developed society. The Government’s thinking promotes not only women’s development but also women-led development. According the highest priority to women’s security, several effective steps have been initiated with the cooperation of the States. Penalties for crimes against women have been made harsher and the new penal provisions are being strictly enforced. The ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ campaign has brought down female foeticide and improved the sex ratio in many districts of the country. 

37. Rural women are the biggest beneficiaries of freedom from smoke through ‘Ujjwala Yojana’, vaccination through ‘Mission Indradhanush’ and free electricity connections under ‘Saubhagya’ Yojana. Women are also being given priority in the registration of houses built under ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ in the rural areas. Under this scheme, nearly 2 crore new houses will be built in the villages during the next three years.

38. Facilities for the women workers in the unorganized sector are also being augmented. Self-employment opportunities are being made available to rural women through ‘Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rashtriya Aajivika Mission. Under the ‘Rashtriya Aajivika Mission’, loans amounting to more than Rs 2 lakh crore have been disbursed so far to 3 crore women in rural areas. 

39. My Government is committed to make women equal stakeholders in the country’s development and prosperity. Efforts will be made in collaboration with industry and corporate sector to provide better employment opportunities to women. In addition, in Government procurement, priority will be given to those enterprises where women’s participation in the workforce is more than the prescribed limit.

40. To secure equal rights for every sister and daughter in the country, eradication of social evils like ‘Triple Talaq’ and ‘Nikah-Halala’ is imperative. I would urge all the members to cooperate in these efforts to make the lives of our sisters and daughters better and dignified.

Honourable Members, 

41. Our young generation must have a meaningful participation in the building of New India. In the last five years, attempts have been made for developing the skills of the youth, providing them financial support for start-ups and self-employment, and making available adequate number of seats for higher education. The amount of scholarship has also been increased by 25 per cent.

42. The Government has made provision of 10 per cent reservation for youth from economically weaker section of the general category. This will enable them to get more opportunities in employment and education. 

43. To enable the youth of all strata of society to fulfil their dreams, timely provision of financial resources is being emphasised. The impact of ‘Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna’ has been felt on a big scale. Under this scheme, about 19 crore loans have been disbursed for self-employment. An effort will now be made to cover 30 crore people by expanding this scheme. A facility for entrepreneurs to avail loan up to Rs. 50 lakh without any guarantee will also be introduced. Apart from this, new employment opportunities will be generated through appropriate policies in sectors which have the potential to accelerate the economy.

44. Today India has joined the league of countries with most number of start-ups in the world. To improve the start-up ecosystem, the Government is simplifying the rules. This campaign will be further expedited. Our goal is to establish 50,000 start-ups in the country by 2024. 

45. Research is being encouraged in higher educational institutions. To further strengthen this effort, it is proposed to establish a ‘National Research Foundation’. This proposed foundation will work as a bridge between different Departments of the Central Government, science laboratories, higher educational institutions and industrial institutions. 

46. To enable various higher educational institutions of India to find a place in the top 500 educational institutions of the world, they are being encouraged through grant of autonomy and financial assistance.

47. My Government is striving to increase the number of seats in the country’s Higher Education System by one-and-a-half times by 2024. With this initiative, 2 crore additional seats would be available for the youth in higher educational institutions.

Honourable Members, 

48. It is our responsibility to provide appropriate opportunities, environment and quality education to enhance the talent of children. In this regard, the ‘Pradhan Mantri Innovative Learning Programme’ will be started.

49. In order to attract children early enough, at the school level, towards technology, suitable infrastructure is being created. Through the ‘Atal Innovation Mission’, the work of establishing ‘Atal Tinkering Labs’ in about 9,000 schools across the country, is progressing rapidly. Similarly, ‘Atal Incubation Centres’ are being set up in 102 universities and other institutions.

50. Impressive performance in sports competitions at the world level, enhances the pride of the country as well as increases the interest of children and youth in sports. It also strengthens the culture of according primacy to health in life. To make India a global sports powerhouse, it is important that talented players living in far-flung areas of the country are identified and their selection process is made transparent. To identify the players at the state and district level, it has been decided to widen the ‘Khelo-India Programme’. Under this, 2,500 talented players have been selected, and are being trained. Now this facility will be provided to 2,500 new players every year. 

51. The sports infrastructure in the country will be modernised as well as expanded. A new system is being evolved to make available modern infrastructure and facilities to the players. It is our endeavour that our players win high accolades in the sports world and enhance the prestige of our country.

Honourable Members,

52. Economic development plays the most vital role in improving the lives of our countrymen. Today India is among the fastest growing economies in the world.  Inflation is low, fiscal deficit is under control, foreign exchange reserves are growing and the impact of Make In India  is clearly visible.

53. India is now on the way to become the world’s 5th largest economy in terms of GDP. To maintain the high growth rate, reform process will continue. It is our objective to make India a 5-trillion dollar economy by 2024. 

54. Work is underway in full earnest to transform India into a Global Manufacturing Hub.  Keeping in view Industry 4.0, a New Industrial Policy will be announced shortly.  In ‘Ease of Doing Business’, India has leap-frogged 65 positions during the past 5 years, from a ranking of 142 in 2014 to 77. Now our goal is to be among the top 50 countries of the world.  In order to achieve this, process of simplification of rules will be further expedited in collaboration with the States. In this sequence, necessary amendments are also being brought in the Companies Law.

55. Taxation regime plays an important role in accelerating economic development. Along with continuous reform, simplification of taxation system is also being emphasised.  Exemption to persons earning up to Rs. 5 lakh from payment of income tax is an important step in this direction.

 56. Similarly, indirect tax system is also being made simple and effective.  With the implementation of GST, the concept of ‘One country, One tax, One market’ has become a reality.  Efforts to further simplify the GST will continue.

 57. Keeping in view the interests of small traders, my Government has launched a New Pension Scheme for them.  ‘National Traders Welfare Board’ will be constituted shortly, and ‘National Retail Trade Policy’ will be formulated to promote retail business.  Accident insurance of up to Rs. 10 lakh will also be provided to all traders registered under GST.

58. MSME sector provides a strong foundation to the country’s economy, and plays a critical role in employment generation.  Several steps have been taken to ensure smooth cash flow to enterprises run by small entrepreneurs. In order to ensure that entrepreneurs associated with MSME sector do not face any problem in accessing credit, the credit guarantee coverage is being enhanced to Rs. 1 lakh crore. 

Honourable Members, 

59.  Good governance reduces corruption, enhances self-respect of the citizens and enables them to optimally utilize their talents and capabilities.

60. My Government will make the Zero Tolerance Policy against corruption more comprehensive and effective. The mission to eliminate corruption from public life and Government services will be implemented with greater zeal. Towards this objective, Minimum Government - Maximum Governance will be further emphasised. In addition, use of technology will be maximised to reduce Human Interface.  Appointment of Lokpal will also promote transparency.

61. The campaign against black money will be taken forward at a faster pace. During the last two years, 4 lakh 25 thousand Company Directors have been disqualified and the registration of 3 lakh 50 thousand suspicious companies has been revoked.

62. The ‘Fugitive and Economic Offenders Act’ has proved effective in controlling fugitive economic offenders. Now we are receiving information in this regard from 146 countries, including Switzerland. Of these, we have concluded agreements with 80 countries for automatic exchange of information. We are now receiving information about all those who have stashed black money abroad.

63. The impact of ‘Real Estate Regulation Act’ or RERA is clearly visible in curbing black money transactions in real estate sector and protecting the interests of the customers; providing  huge relief to the middle class families.

64.  ‘Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code’ is among the biggest and most impactful economic reforms undertaken in the country. With the coming into force of this Code, banks and other financial institutions have been able to settle directly or indirectly an amount of more than Rs. 3 lakh 50 thousand crore. This Code has also curbed the tendency of wilfully defaulting on loans taken from banks and other financial institutions.

65. Under the ‘Direct Benefit Transfer’, funds from more than
400 schemes are being directly credited into the accounts of beneficiaries. During the last five years, Rs. 7 lakh 30 thousand crore have been transferred through DBT. So far, not only has DBT prevented Rs. 1 lakh 41 thousand crore from falling into wrong hands, but it has also enabled deletion of names of about 8 crore ineligible beneficiaries. DBT will be further expanded in the coming days. I would urge the State Governments to use DBT in more and more schemes.

Honourable Members,

66. Infrastructure will play an important role in ushering in a prosperous India. My Government’s continuous endeavour has been to build infrastructure in an eco-friendly manner. Along with concrete, greenery has been made an integral part of the highway and expressway projects.  For supply of electricity, optimal utilisation of solar energy is being stressed. Household and industrial wastes are also being used in road construction.

67. In the 21st century economy, the pace and spread of urbanization will continue to increase.  Development of urban infrastructure in cities and suburbs will pave the way for economic progress and enhance employment opportunities. My Government is tirelessly working for a modern India, by providing world-class infrastructure and public amenities in villages as well as cities. Special emphasis is being accorded to improving connectivity in the North-East, hilly and tribal areas. In addition to increasing the ease of living of citizens in the North-East; tourism, agriculture and other allied sectors will also benefit from better connectivity. Effective steps are being taken to expand organic farming in the North-East.

68. Under the ‘Bharatmala Project’, construction or upgradation of about 35,000 kilometers of National Highways is to be undertaken by 2022.  In addition, under the ‘Sagarmala Project’, a network of good quality roads is being constructed in coastal areas and areas adjoining ports.  

69. Along with the highways, Government is also working extensively in the area of Railways, Airways and Inland Waterways. Under the ‘UDAN Scheme’, air connectivity to smaller towns is being expanded rapidly.  

70.  Urban transport infrastructure is being created to cater to present and future requirements.  While developing infrastructure, attention is also being given to addressing the challenges posed by pollution. My Government is developing a transport system, which is not only fast and safe, but is also environment friendly.  For this, special emphasis is given to Public transport.  Metro rail network is being expanded rapidly in several cities. The facility of ‘One Nation, One Card’ has been launched to realize the dream of seamless mobility. Similarly, electric vehicles are being promoted to reduce vehicular pollution. The network of electric charging stations is also being expanded rapidly.

71. Modern amenities like gas-grid and I-Ways are being developed at a rapid pace. PNG based domestic fuel and CNG based transportation systems are being developed. In modern India, we are according a special emphasis on production of bio-fuel. Prior to 2014, about 67 crore litres of ethanol was being blended.  This year, we have set a target of about 270 crore litres for ethanol blending. Enhancing the use of blended ethanol will not only benefit our farmers but also safeguard the environment. Further, it will reduce import of petroleum products thus saving foreign exchange.

Honourable Members,

72. My Government is fully devoted to make the flow of Ganga uninterrupted and pollution free. Recently, encouraging evidence of revival of aquatic life at several locations along Ganga have been reported.  This year, during the Ardhakumbh in Prayagraj, the cleanliness of Ganga and amenities provided to the devotees have made news throughout the world. My Government has enhanced the dignity and self-esteem of every person who contributed towards the successful organization of Ardhakumbh by honouring them.

73. Under the ‘Namami Gange’ scheme, my Government will further accelerate the campaign for closure of drains releasing effluents in the river Ganga. On the lines of river Ganga, the Government will also endeavour to clean up other rivers such as Kaveri, Periyar, Narmada, Yamuna, Mahanadi and Godavari.

74. My Government is making earnest efforts for conservation of forests, wildlife and the environment.  In recent years, forest and tree cover has increased by more than 1 per cent. During the last five years, protected areas in the country have also increased. In 2014, the number of protected areas in the country was 692, which has now gone up to 868. To address the challenges posed by air pollution, ‘National Clean Air Programme’ has been started in 102 cities.

75. Solar energy plays an important role in reducing the adverse effects of Climate Change and Global Warming. Proactive efforts of India have resulted in the formation of the International Solar Alliance. Through this organization, India is contributing significantly to the development of solar energy in the developing countries of the world.

Honourable Members,

76. Space Technology plays a central role in improving the lives of the common man, providing early-warning of impending disasters, identifying location of natural resources, providing signals to various means of communication and ensuring national security. It is the endeavour of my Government to maximize the use of space technology for human welfare. Several facilities such as roads, houses for poor, farming or equipment for fishermen have all been linked to space technology.

77. Space technology has helped us in further strengthening our security at land, air and water. Our expertise in accurate weather forecast has improved. This was evidenced during the recent ‘Cyclone Phani‘ that struck the eastern coast of the country. Due to accurate information and timely preparation, large scale destruction to life and property was averted. 

78. India is marching forward to assume a leadership role in unravelling and comprehending the mysteries of space. Our scientists are involved in the preparations for the launch of ‘Chandrayaan-2’, which will be India’s first spacecraft to reach the Moon. We are also making rapid progress towards achieving the goal of sending the first Indian in India’s own ‘Gaganyaan’ by 2022. 

79. During the Lok Sabha elections, the country attained another milestone, which however, did not receive as much attention as it should have. With the successful testing of ‘Mission Shakti’ a new dimension has been added to India’s capability in space technology and security-preparedness. For this, today I once again congratulate our scientists and engineers.

80. The role of technology in the field of security is expanding continuously. Keeping this in view, work is in progress to establish three joint service agencies for space, cyber and special forces. These collaborative efforts will strengthen the security of the country.

Honourable Members,

81. New India is rapidly moving towards occupying its rightful place in the world community. Today, India has acquired a new image and our relations with other countries have become stronger. It is a matter of immense pleasure that in 2022, India will host the G-20 Summit.

82. The world community enthusiastically supported India’s proposal to declare June 21st as ‘International Day of Yoga’ by the United Nations. At present, several programmes associated with International Day of Yoga are being organized with great enthusiasm in various countries, of which the most important events will be held tomorrow, the 21st June.

83. The world community supports India’s position on various issues such as climate change, economic and cyber-crime, action against corruption and black money and energy security. Today the whole world stands with India on the issue of terrorism. Designation of Masood Azhar, responsible for dastardly terrorist attacks on our soil, as a global terrorist by United Nations, is a major testimony to this fact.

84. My Government’s “Neighborhood First” policy is an evidence of our approach of according priority to South Asia and countries in the adjoining region. India will play a crucial role in the progress of this region. Accordingly, trade, connectivity and people-to-people contact are being encouraged in this region. The presence of Heads of States and Heads of Governments of ‘BIMSTEC’ countries, Kyrgyzstan – the current chair of ‘Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’ and Mauritius during the swearing-in of the new Government is a reflection of this policy.

85. My Government is also conscious of protecting the interests of Indians living and working abroad. Today an Indian, if caught in any crisis abroad, is confident of receiving timely help and relief. Several services ranging from passports to visas have been made easy and accessible.

86.  Due to the efforts of my Government, India’s philosophy, culture and achievements have got a distinct recognition at the global stage.  This year, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, which is being celebrated world over, will provide a fillip to India’s ‘Thought Leadership’. Similarly, programmes related to the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji, will help spread the light of India’s spiritual wisdom throughout the world.

Honourable Members,

87.  New India will be sensitive and also, economically prosperous. But for this to happen, nation’s security is of utmost importance. My Government accords top most priority to national security. Therefore, effective steps are being taken to tackle Terrorism and Naxalism.

88. India has amply demonstrated both her intent and capabilities, first through surgical strikes and then through air strikes after the Pulwama attack at terrorist hideouts across the border. In future too, all possible steps will be taken to ensure our security.

89. Illegal infiltrators pose a major threat to our internal security. This is leading to social imbalance in many parts of the country, as well as putting a huge pressure on limited livelihood opportunities. My Government has decided to implement the process of ‘National Register of Citizens’ on priority basis in areas affected by infiltration. Security along the border will be further strengthened to prevent infiltration.

90. While on the one hand, Government is working to identify the infiltrators, on the other, it is also fully committed to protecting the victims of persecution due to their faith. In this regard, efforts will be made to amend the Citizenship Act while protecting the linguistic, cultural and social identities. 

91. My Government is making efforts with complete dedication to provide a safe and peaceful environment to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir. The recently concluded peaceful elections to local bodies and to Lok Sabha have bolstered our efforts. My Government is committed to take all necessary steps for the development of Jammu and Kashmir.

92.  My Government is resolutely working to eradicate the menace of Naxalism from the country. Considerable success has been achieved in this direction during the last 5 years. The area affected by Naxalism is reducing continuously. In the coming years, development projects will be expedited in these areas, which will benefit our tribal brothers and sisters residing there.

Honourable Members,

93. My Government is rapidly taking forward the work of modernisation of the army and the armed forces. India is going to receive the delivery of first ‘Rafale’ fighter aircraft and ‘Apache’ helicopters in the near future.

94. Special emphasis is being accorded by the Government to manufacture of modern armaments under ‘Make in India’. The policy of indigenously manufacturing weapons such as modern rifles and cannons, tanks and combat aircrafts is being carried forward successfully. ‘Defence Corridors’ coming up in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu will further strengthen this mission. While fulfilling our security requirements, export of defence equipment is also being encouraged.

95. Respect towards soldiers and martyrs enhances self-respect and enthusiasm among the forces, and also strengthens our military capabilities. Hence, all possible efforts are being made to take care of our soldiers and their families. Through ‘One Rank One Pension’, increased pensionary benefits to ex-service men and expansion of health facilities, efforts are being made to improve their living standards.

96. The National War Memorial near India Gate in Delhi, built by my Government, seven decades after India’s independence, is a tribute to the martyrs by a grateful nation. Similarly my Government has set up the ‘National Police Memorial’ in memory of police personnel who were martyred while safeguarding the security of the country.

Honourable Members,

97. Inspiration from history guides us towards the future path of nation building. It is our duty to preserve the memory of our nation-builders and gratefully remember them. There have been many such efforts during the last five years. ‘Dandi Museum’ has been built to honour Pujya Bapu and the historic Dandi March. “Statue of Unity”, the tallest statue in the world, has been built as a mark of our gratitude to the Iron Man, Sardar Patel. ‘Kranti Mandir’ has been set up at the Red Fort in Delhi, as a tribute to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and other freedom fighters of Azad Hind Fauj. 26 Alipur Road in Delhi, the site of Babasaheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar’s Mahaparinirvana has been developed as a National Memorial. A museum is also being built in Delhi as a mark of respect to the contributions of all former Prime Ministers of the country.

98. My Government, inspired by Sardar Patel, is committed to further strengthen the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’. For this, it is essential to accord importance to National Ambitions and Regional Aspirations. All forms of dialogue and cooperation will be encouraged to achieve this. Guided by the principle of  ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas’, it is the endeavour of my Government to ensure that no citizen is left behind in India’s journey of development. 

Honourable Members,

99. India had to pass through a long period of subjugation. But throughout this period, Indians kept fighting for independence in different parts of the country. The longing for freedom and willingness to make sacrifices to achieve freedom had never waned. This desire for independence culminated into the ‘Quit India Movement’ in 1942, when the entire nation was determined to achieve independence and even to sacrifice their lives in this cause. Contributing to the freedom struggle was the only thought behind all the actions of our countrymen. We achieved our independence in 1947 on the strength of this collective spirit. 

100. Today, all of us are again at a juncture of creating history. We are striving to launch a new movement for ushering in a new era. Our resolve today will determine the shape of the India of 2047 when we celebrate the centenary of our independence.

101. Today, our country is enriched with the experiences of a 72-year journey since independence. The nation is moving ahead only by learning from these experiences. All of us have to move ahead with the resolve to realise the idea of New India by the year 2022 when we celebrate the 75th anniversary of India’s independence.  Thus, in the New India in the 75th year of its independence:

       - Farmers’ income will be doubled;

       - Every poor will have a pucca roof over his head;

       - Every poor will have access to clean fuel;

       - Every poor will have electricity connection;

       - No poor will be compelled to defecate in the open;

       - Every poor will have access to medical facilities;

       - Every village in the country will be connected by roads;

       - River Ganga will flow uninterrupted, and pollution free;

       - In collaboration with States, India will be close to becoming a $ 5 trillion economy;

       - We will be progressing towards joining world’s three largest economies;

       - An Indian will unfurl the tri-colour in space, entirely on the strength of indigenous resources; and

       - We will provide leadership to global development with a new zeal and confidence.

Honourable Members,

102. If the gap between the public and the Government is reduced, and public partnership is ensured, our countrymen can transform Government schemes and programmes into mass movements. This is the way forward to achieve transformative national goals. Adopting this approach, programmes like the ‘Beti-Bachao, Beti-Padhao’, and ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ evolved into mass movements. On the strength of people’s participation, we will also achieve the objective of a New India.

Honourable Members,

103. It is the belief of my Government that political parties, States and 130 crore countrymen are all committed to India’s integrated and accelerated development. Our vibrant democracy has also matured adequately.  During the last few decades, due to frequent elections being held in some part of the country or the other, the pace and continuity of development programmes have been impacted. Our countrymen have demonstrated their wisdom by delivering a clear verdict both at State and National issues.  ‘One Nation – Simultaneous Elections’ is the need of the hour, which would facilitate accelerated development, thereby benefitting our countrymen.  With such a system in place, all political parties, according to their respective ideologies, will be able to better utilise their energy towards development and public welfare. Therefore, I urge all Members of Parliament to seriously ponder over this development oriented proposal of ‘One Nation - Simultaneous Elections’.

Honourable Members,

104. This year also marks 70 years of adoption of the Indian Constitution. As a Member of Parliament, all of you have undertaken the oath or affirmation to discharge your duties with true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India. The Constitution is paramount to all of us. The chief architect of our Constitution, Babasaheb
Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar had said that ‘we must hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives’.

105. Our Constitution provides guidance for ensuring social, economic and political justice as well as securing liberty and equality for all citizens; and promote fraternity among all, assuring the dignity of the individual.

106.  I believe that you all Members of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, as parliamentarians, will make invaluable contributions in achieving the ideals of the Constitution while discharging your duties. In this way, you will contribute effectively in ushering in a New India.

107. All of us will have to accord priority to our duties as public representatives and as citizens of the country. Only then will we be able to inspire countrymen to discharge their duties as citizens.

108. My advice to all MPs is that you should always remember the fundamental mantra of Gandhiji. He had said that every decision of ours should be guided by its impact on the poorest and the weakest person in the society. You must also remember the voter who setting aside all his work and overcoming his difficulties went to the polling station to cast his vote and discharge his responsibilities towards the nation. Your priority should be to fulfil his aspirations.

109. I urge you all to dedicate yourselves in the task of building a New India and to discharge your duties with utmost sincerity over the next five years. I once again wish the very best to all of you. 

Jai Hind!

Describing Sri Sri Ravi Shankar as an icon of non-violence and universal human values, the Vice President lauded the work and services rendered by the Art of Living Foundation and its volunteers across the globe.

 

Shri Naidu said that Art of Living began as an idea to bring a smile on every face to make life a celebration. “It is a very noble idea which will enhance the wellbeing of individuals and society at large and ultimately uplift the human spirit,” he added.

 

Reiterating that ‘Share and Care’ was the core of the Indian philosophy, Shri Naidu said that everybody must be inspired by it and serve the society to the best of his or her abilities.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asserted that India was built on the foundations of a fundamentally tolerant civilization and that no other philosophy or religion encapsulates the principle of equality in human beings as succinctly as Indian philosophy.

 

Referring to recent reports on religious freedom in India, the Vice President reiterated that India was the land on which different thoughts and philosophies have taken birth and flourished all through the ages.

 

Speaking at event after releasing the commemorative coins dedicated to 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, here today, he said the plural nature of the Indian society was encapsulated as early as 3rd century BC in an inscription of Ashoka. The Core principle of Indian philosophy is ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ which means the whole world in one family.

 

Observing that religious freedom was a Fundamental Right guaranteed under Articles 25 to 28 of Indian Constitution, Shri Naidu said that preamble of the Constitution declares India as Secular so as to guarantee equality to every citizen without any discrimination on the basis of religion. ‘This Constitutional prescription is nothing but a natural culmination of the core values of Indian civilisation that has evolved over the last 5000 years,’ he added.

 

The Vice President described Guru Nanak Dev Ji as one of the greatest spiritual masters of India and the true representative of the sublime spiritual traditions of our Bhakti Movement. He said that Guru Nanak Dev Ji took the faith out of broken structures of rituals and superstitions and kindled it in the hearts and soul of common people.

 

The Vice President said that Guru Nanak Dev ji taught ethical and compassionate ways to lead a life of satisfaction and fulfillment and gave three Golden Principles to humanity - Kirat karo (Earn Your Livelihood with honest ethical ways with earnest effort), Naam Japo (feel the divine benediction every moment, around you and realize it within your heart) and Wand Chhakko (Share with other selflessly).

 

Shri Naidu said that Guru Nanak ji made India’s age-old tradition of Sharing and Caring the cornerstone of our social ethics.’ This ethical foundation of share and care has guided us for last 550 years,’ he added.

 

Pointing out the Guru Nanak Dev Ji preached for an equitable and shared prosperity of the community and an inclusive society he said these timeless virtues were not only immortal but ever more relevant today as we seek higher growth rates for our economy

 

“Our growth has to be compassionate, socially inclusive to be sustainable. Polarization of wealth and prosperity will make our economic growth unsustainable and will eventually cause social disruption,” he added

 

Stressing the need to ensure that no section gets marginalized in our fast moving economy, Shri Naidu said “as a society, it is incumbent upon the better-off to look after the needs, interests, respect and dignity of those who live at the margins of our society.”

 

​The Union Minister for Food Processing Industries, Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the President of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, Shri Manjinder Singh Sirsa, the General Secretary of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, Shri Harmeet Singh Kalka and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“गुरु नानक देव जी की 550वीं जन्म जयंती के अवसर पर उनकी पावन स्मृति में विशेष सिक्कों को जारी करने के अवसर पर, आप सभी के साथ सम्मिलित होने पर हर्ष हो रहा है। गुरु नानक देव जी भारत की महानतम आध्यात्मिक विभूतियों में से एक थे। वे भक्ति कालीन उदार आध्यात्मिक परंपरा के सच्चे प्रतिनिधि थे।

 

मुझे यह जानकर प्रसन्नता है कि इन सिक्कों के डिजाइन का चयन कालेज के विद्यार्थियों में प्रतियोगिता के माध्यम से किया गया है। हमारे युवाओं ने गुरु नानक देव जी के व्यक्तित्व, कृतित्व और उनकी शिक्षा को भली प्रकार से समझा और उसे अपनी कला के माध्यम से प्रस्तुत किया। मैं इस प्रतियोगिता में भाग लेने वाले हर प्रतियोगी का अभिनंदन करता हूं। जैसा कि गुरु नानक देव जी ने कहा ‘एक ओंकार सतनाम’ - मानवता के लिए उनका संदेश एक ही था और वह अमर है-लेकिन आपमें से हर किसी ने उस संदेश को पूरी निष्ठा से आत्मसात किया और फिर भिन्न-भिन्न प्रकार से डिजाइनों में व्यक्त किया।

 

I am pleased to join this occasion to release the special commemorative coins  on the occasion of 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji,  one of the greatest spiritual masters of the India and the true representative of the sublime spiritual traditions of our Bhakti Movement.

 

I am pleased to know that design for these coins has been selected through a collage level competition. Our youngsters have tastefully and imaginatively expressed themselves,  how they perceived the eternal teachings of Guru Nanak Dev ji. I compliment every participant in the competition. As Guru Nanak Dev ji said..– Ek Omkaar Satnaam-, his message to the humanity is one and eternal, but every one of you have perceived it earnestly and only expressed it differently.

 

The release of commemorative coins is a humble acknowledgement by a grateful generation, of the eternal legacy Guru Nanak Dev ji left for us which has transcended successive generations and regions of the world. 

 

Guru Nanak Dev ji was the shinning representative of the sublime spiritual ethos of the Bhakti movement. It was the period of recurrent political upheaval in the country. Every violent political upheaval disrupts the cultural milieu of the community wherein social relations and interactions thrive. The new power elite tend to impose new exploitative methods in place of settled economic relations based on ethical compassion and redistributive justice.  Every such disruption leaves behind the traces of social delinquency devoid of ethical moorings. Devoid of its spiritual anchor the society drifts towards gradual disintegration and degeneration. History has proved that every aggression had social, cultural and economic consequences for the individual communities.  The region where Guru Nanak Dev ji was born, was in the forefront of facing these successive violent onslaught. In such desperate circumstances he provided the ethical and spiritual succor to a crying and craving humanity.

 

He took the faith out of broken structures of rituals and superstitions and kindled it the hearts and soul of common people. He truly democratized the religion by making the common man, the sovereign of his own enlightened spiritual realm. He humanized the God and turned the Man into divine. His teachings were simply explained in local language and people could associate with him and follow his simple teaching in their daily life.

 

गुरु नानक देव जी ने एक संतुष्ट खुशहाल जीवन जीने के लिए नैतिक और सौहार्दपूर्ण मार्ग बताया। उन्होंने तीन स्वर्णिम उपदेश दिये - कीरत करो (अपनी जीविका ईमानदारी और मेहनत से कमाओ), नाम जपो (हर क्षण ईश्वर की कृपा महसूस करो, ईश्वर को स्वयं अपने अंदर और अपने चारों ओर महसूस करो) तथा वांद छको (अपने सुख समृद्धि को नि:स्वार्थ भाव से सबके साथ बांटो)। उन्होंने सिखाया कि जो समृद्ध है वे भी ईमानदारी और मेहनत से कमाएं, वे समाज के प्रति जिम्मेदार बने, समाज के प्रति काम आयें। वे अपनी समृद्धि को ईश्वर की कृपा के रूप में स्वीकार करें और ईश्वर के प्रति समर्पित हों। वे अपनी समृद्धि को एक ट्रस्टी की तरह समाज के प्रति जिम्मेदारी के रूप में देखें, और समुदाय के साथ बाटें। उनके अनुसार समृद्धि को समुदाय के साथ बांटने से, समाज सम्मिलित रूप से समृद्ध, संतुष्ट और नैतिक रूप से सुदृढ़ बनता है।

 

गुरु नानक देव जी ने Share and Care की हमारी पुरानी परंपरा को सामाजिक नैतिकता का आधार बना दिया। Share and Care के इस नैतिक संदेश ने पिछले 550 वर्षों से हमारा मार्गदर्शन किया है। आज भी हम देखते हैं कि किसी भी आपदा के समय सिख युवा किस प्रकार राहत शिविर लगाते हैं, शहरों के मेहनतकश मजदूरों को सांत्वना, सहायता देने के लिए शिविर लगाये जाते हैं।

 

श्रम और श्रमिक का सम्मान उनकी शिक्षा का मूलभाव था। करतारपुर में अपने प्रवास के दौरान उन्होंने स्वयं खेती की और किसान का जीवन अपना कर, अपने परिवार का भरण पोषण किया। गुरुद्वारों में लगने वाले लंगर, किसी भी प्रकार के भेदभाव से परे एक आदर्श सामुदायिक जीवन का अप्रतिम उदाहरण हैं। सहानुभूतिपूर्ण करुणा, विनम्रता तथा श्रम का सम्मान गुरु नानक देव जी और नौ आदरणीय उत्तराधिकारी गुरुओं की शिक्षा का सार है।

 

Guru Nanak Dev ji taught ethical and compassionate ways to lead a life of satisfaction and fulfillment.  He gave three Golden Principles to us- Kirat karo (Earn Your Livelihood with honest ethical ways with earnest effort), Naam Japo (feel the divine benediction every moment, around you and realize it within your heart) and Wand Chhakko (Share with other selflessly). He taught us that those who are well off must earn righteously, they should be socially responsible and relevant, they should always submit in humility for the divine benediction bestowed upon them. They must hold and use their wealth in trust and share it with the community. For him, sharing the prosperity with the larger community made the society collectively prosperous, happy and satisfied and ethically upright. 

 

Guru Nanak ji made our age old tradition of Sharing and Caring the corner stone of our social ethics. This ethical foundation of Share and Care has guided us for last 550 years. Even today we see groups of young Sikh man and women promptly arranging relief in case of any disaster or accident; camps are set up to provide succor and solace to hardworking labourers in cities. Dignity of labour was at the core of his teaching. During his stay at Kartarpur, he himself took up the life of a farmer and cultivated lands, earning a righteous living for his family.  The community kitchens at Gurudwara, the Lungers, are the best example of an ideal community living without any type of discrimination. This compassionate humility and dignity of labour has been the has been the integral part of the Guru Nanak Dev Ji and his Nine respected successor Gurus. 

 

He preached for the equitable shared prosperity of the community and an inclusive society and made the objectives of economic prosperity converge with an ethical compassionate society.

 

Friends,

 

ये कालजयी शिक्षा न केवल शाश्वत है बल्कि आज कहीं अधिक जरुरी और प्रासंगिक है। आज जब हम अपनी अर्थव्यवस्था को तीव्रतर वृद्धि दर से बढ़ा रहे हैं -हमारा प्रयास है कि हमारी अर्थव्यवस्था इतनी विस्तृत हो कि वह सर्वस्पर्शी, सर्व समावेशी भी हो। प्रधानमंत्री नरेन्द्र मोदी द्वारा दिया गया मंत्र ‘सबका साथ सबका विकास, सबका विश्वास’ - वस्तुत: महान गुरुओं की उदार शिक्षाओं से ही प्रेरित है।

 

These timeless virtues are not only immortal but are ever more relevant today as we seek ever higher growth rates for our economy. We seek to expand our economy to include every section of the society. When Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi gave the mantra of “ Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas”, his mantra of economic growth draws inspiration from the Teachings of Great Gurus.

 

Our Growth has to be compassionate, socially inclusive to be sustainable. Polerisation of wealth and prosperity will make our economic growth unsustainable and will eventually cause social disruption. Money is only medium of redistribution of wealth in a community. It will lose its value and relevance if it is hoarded by only a select few in the society. Such a society despite having wealth will not grow, as the aggregate demand, which is the engine of growth and wellbeing, will remain constricted. Inclusive and equitable redistribution of community’s wealth is essential to generate aggregate demand.   Therefore equal and regular redistribution of wealth is not only ethical but is also important for sustainability of growth momentum in economy.

 

Friends,

 

As we grow faster, we must ensure that no section gets marginalized in our fast moving economy.  The economy must move faster but must also expand to provide adequate opportunities to the marginalized. As a society, it is incumbent upon those who are better-off to look after the needs, interests, respect and dignity of those who live at the margins of our society. 

 

Prosperity, well being and happiness are essentially measured in terms of entire community. Individual prosperity will be considered only an aberration if there is overall misery and poverty in the society and therefore will be unsustainable in longer run. 

 

मित्रों,

समय के साथ तकनीक बदलती है, आराम के भौतिक साधन बदलते हैं-लेकिन हमारी नैतिक आस्थाऐं वही रहती हैं। नैतिकता - समुदाय की सम्मति से निर्धारित होती है। हमारे नैतिक मूल्यों को पीढ़ियों आर्शीवाद प्राप्त है। वे पीढ़ियों के अनुभवों, आदर्शों और परंपरओं पर आधारित हैं। गुरु नानक देव जी के तीन शाश्वत स्वर्णिम सिद्धांत आज भी उतने ही सार्थक हैं जितने 550 वर्ष पहले थे।

 

मैं, गुरु नानक देव जी की 550वीं जन्म जयंती मनाने के लिए इस आयोजन से संबद्ध हर किसी का अभिनंदन करता हूं। यह आयोजन गुरु नानक देव जी की शिक्षाओं के प्रचार-प्रसार, विशेषकर युवाओं के बीच प्रसार में सहायक होगा। हमारे युवा हमारी समृद्ध और उदार नैतिक आध्यात्मिक धरोहर को अपनाऐं। उस विरासत को अपनाऐं जो महान संतों द्वारा हमें प्रदान की गई है और उन शिक्षाओं को जीवन में उतारें।

 

With time only technologies change, material comforts may change but we remain anchored in our ethical moorings. Ethics is moral laws based on a social consensus. Our ethical foundations have the moral force of generations. The three eternal teachings of Guru Nanak Dev ji  are as relevant today as they were 550 years ago.

 

I compliment everyone associated with this commendable initiative for celebrating the 550 Birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev  ji as an occasion to spread the light of his teachings among people particularly the youth of our country, who must be grounded in our rich ethical. They must own up the rich spiritual legacy left behind by our Saints and live up to those ideals.

 

I thank you, for giving me the opportunity to associate myself with this momentous occasion.

 

Thank you.”

During the interaction, the Vice President advised Shri Rai to expedite the completion of the Southern Campus building of the National Institute of Disaster Management at Kondapavuluru village in Krishna District, which is coming up on a 10-acre site. The foundation stone for the building was laid by the Vice President on May 22, 2018 in the presence of the then Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju.

An interim setup of NIDM southern campus is currently operating in the campus of Andhra Pradesh Human Resource Development Institute at Bapatla.

In view of the vulnerability of the coastal districts to frequent cyclones and natural calamities like floods, the Vice President advised the Minister to enhance capacity building, organize training programs in disaster preparedness and management.

The southern campus aims at ground level issues, local planning, last mile connectivity and mainstreaming disaster management into Sustainable Development Goals through its training and capacity building.

The geography of South India plays a vital role in designing the institute’s programs with special emphasis on disasters specific to Southern states.

The Minister of State for Jal Shakti and Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Rattan Lal Kataria and the Minister of State for Women and Child Development, Sushri Deboshree Choudhary also called on the Vice President and informed him about their respective departmental programs and activities undertaken by their Ministries.

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for launching special campaigns to target vulnerable groups like school-college students and make them aware of the deleterious effects of drug abuse. He also wanted special attention to be paid towards youngsters from lower socio-economic strata as they were highly vulnerable and prone to various high-risk behaviours.

Speaking at an event organized by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment on the International Day Against Drug Abuse & Illicit Trafficking, here today, Shri Naidu expressed concern over the worrisome trend of substance abuse and said it was estimated that globally around 275 million people (in the age group of 15- 64) used drugs at least once during 2016. Quoting WHO, he said roughly 4, 50,000 people died as a result of drug use in 2015.

Observing that those addicted to substance abuse also have to grapple with major health problems such as physical and mental disorders, illnesses, injuries, premature loss of lives and years of lives with disabilities, he opined that it would not only cast a financial burden on the family, but would also become a drain on the public exchequer and pose a major challenge to the health system.

Referring to the challenge posed by drug abuse, he said the efforts of the Governmental agencies alone would not suffice and called up on the civil society, NGOs and dedicated individuals to supplement the efforts of the government in eradicating the menace. 

Observing that addiction should only be treated as an illness, Shri Naidu said that those who have turned towards substance abuse must to be counseled, rehabilitated and treated with care and affection.

“Parents and teachers should be counseled that isolation and stigmatization would only enlarge the problem and not in any way help the person addicted to substance abuse to overcome it,” he added.

The Vice President asked NGOs engaged in rehabilitation of those addicted to substance abuse to treat them humanely and enable them to become productive members of the society.

Opining that rehabilitation was crucial to wean away youngsters from addiction and make them productive by bringing them into the mainstream of the society, the Vice President urged the corporate sector to earmark funds for such activities under CSR. 

The Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, the Ministers of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Ramdas Athawale, Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar & Shri Rattan Lal Kataria and the Secretary, Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, Ms. Nilam Sawhney and several other dignitaries were present at the event.  

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

 

“आप सभी जानते हैं कि 1987 से संयुक्त राष्ट्र महासभा ने 26 जून को नशीली दवाओं के सेवन और अवैध तस्करी के खिलाफ अंतरराष्ट्रीय दिवस के रूप में मनाने का निर्णय लिया। यह दिन विश्व समुदाय को नशे की लत से मुक्त कराने के हमारे साझा संकल्प और सहयोग का प्रतीक है।

मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि सामाजिक न्याय और अधिकारिता मंत्रालय द्वारा मादक पदार्थों के सेवन, उसके भयावह परिणामों तथा उनकी अवैध तस्करी के बारे में समाज में जागरूकता फैलाने के लिए, आज यह आयोजन किया जा रहा है।


As you all are aware, the United Nations General Assembly decided to observe 26th June as the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking since 1987 as an expression of its determination to strengthen action and cooperation to achieve the goal of an international society free of drug abuse.

I am happy to note that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has organized this function today with an aim to increase awareness on the dangers of drug abuse and the major problem that illicit drugs represent to society.

The menace of drug abuse is a global challenge and the developed as well as the developing nations are grappling with it.

While people of any age group can fall prey to drug abuse, teenagers and youth are particularly vulnerable to the menace. Both, the Government and the civil society have an onerous responsibility to ensure that the potential victims are made aware of the perils of drug abuse and make them remain impervious to the temptations of drugs.

It is really quite alarming to learn that some drugs are potent enough to make a person addicted even after a single use of the drug. Likewise, I am told that the abuse of therapeutic drug for intoxication is becoming a major challenge. This apart, the inhalation of harmful volatile chemicals such as adhesive solutions and erasing fluids is increasingly becoming prevalent, especially among those belonging to the lower economic strata. 

The deviant behaviour of those addicted to substance abuse is a matter of serious concern to the families, society and the governments all over the world. It is estimated that globally around 275 million people (in the age group of 15-64) used drugs at least once during 2016. According to WHO, roughly 4,50,000 people died as a result of drug use in 2015. Of these, 1.67,500 deaths were drug use disorders (mainly overdoses). 

In many cases, those addicted to substance abuse also have to grapple with major health problems such as physical and mental disorders, illnesses, injuries, premature loss of lives and years of lives with disabilities. It not only casts a financial burden on the family, but also becomes a drain on the public exchequer and poses a major challenge to the health systems.

As you all are aware, any intoxicating substance, whether it be alcohol or drug or volatile inhalant can lead to dependence and its harmful use can cause substantial morbidity and mortality. 

Continued heavy alcohol consumption induced by addiction is found to cause early onset of heart diseases, stroke, liver cirrhosis and cancer by affecting the cardio-vascular, gastro-intestinal and immune systems of the body. Once addicted, a person may not be able to get out of the habit, even if he wants to do so, unless he is given assistance including medical treatment for de-addiction and psychological counselling. It is in this context that the Integrated Rehabilitation Centres, or IRCAs, play an important role in weaning away those addicted to substance abuse and are relevant and important. 

These centres offer a variety of services and help the families in de-addiction and rehabilitation, so that the individuals could become useful members of the society. By extending financial and technical support to the IRCAs, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is discharging a great responsibility of the Government in its commitment towards a healthy and peaceful society.

I would also like to appreciate the efforts of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment for conducting the National Survey on Extent and Pattern of Substance Use in 2018 to ascertain the proportion of Indian population using various substances and those affected by substance use disorders. The survey revealed some disturbing trends— about 3.1 crore individuals use cannabis products and 2.26 crore people use opioids.

Having authentic information on the extent and pattern of substance use in India is a significant first step in planning an effective strategy to address and resolve this serious social health problem in India.


बहनों और भाइयो, शुरूआत में ही इस बुरी लत की रोकथाम, इसका सबसे कारगर निदान है। हमें लोगों को, विशेषकर युवाओं को, नशे की लत का शिकार बनने से रोकना होगा। इसके लिए हमें स्कूली बच्चों, कालेज जाने वाले युवाओं, शहरी गरीबों जैसे संवेदनशील वर्गों के बीच नशे के दुष्परिणामों के प्रति जागरुकता फैलाने के लिए विशेष अभियान चलाना होगा। दुर्बल वर्ग के युवा प्राय: इस खतरे का शिकार बनते हैं - जरूरी है कि उनके लिए विशेष अभियान चलाया जाय।

 

शुरूआत में ही नशे की लत की रोकथाम के लिए अभिभावकों, शिक्षकों तथा छात्रों में जागरुकता बढाने पर बल दिया जाना चाहिए। अभिभावकों और शिक्षकों को यह समझना चाहिए कि बच्चे को अलग-थलग करने या उसे नीचा दिखाने से तो समस्या बढेगी। बच्चे को इस लत से बाहर निकालने के लिए संवदेनशीलता बहुत जरुरी है। नशे की आदत को एक बीमारी की तरह ही देखा जाना चाहिए और जो इस बीमारी से ग्रस्त हैं उन्हें परामर्श की आवश्यकता है, उन्हें संवेदनशीलता और स्नेह से सामान्य जीवन में वापस लौटाने की आवश्यकता है।


Dear sisters and brothers, the best solution, of course, is prevention. We need to prevent people, particularly the youngsters from falling to prey to substance abuse. There is a need to launch special campaigns targeted at vulnerable groups like school-college students to make them aware of the deleterious effects of drug abuse. 

 

Also youngsters from lower socio-economic strata need to be targeted as they are highly vulnerable and prone to various high-risk behaviours.

 

To prevent addiction at an early stage, the focus has to be on sensitizing parents, teachers and of course the students. Parents and teachers should be counselled that isolation and stigmatization would only enlarge the problem and not in any way help the person addicted to substance abuse to overcome it. Addiction should be treated as an illness and those who have turned towards substance abuse need to be counselled, rehabilitated and treated with care and affection.  

 

I would like to commend the Ministry for coming up for the first time with a National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction. 

 

As mentioned earlier, the foundation needs to be laid at the stage of school education, whereby the children are made aware of the potential harm drug abuse can cause to an individual and the society at large. They should also be sensitized towards the need for preventive action and community based intervention. 

 

I would also like to appeal to NGOs which are engaged in rehabilitation of those addicted to substance abuse to treat them humanely and enable them to become productive members of the society. 

 

Since rehabilitation is crucial to wean away youngsters from addiction and make them productive by bringing them into the mainstream of the society, I would also urge the corporate sector to earmark funds for such activities under CSR.  

 

I am confident the Ministry’s Action Plan would focus on providing accessible and affordable treatment services for drug addiction by ensuring IRCAs in each district as well as setting up de-addition centres in Government Hospitals. 

 

I am told that in order to increase community participation and public cooperation in drug demand reduction, the Ministry is in the process of launching Focussed Intervention Programmes in selected districts to prevent vulnerable adolescents and youth from taking to substance abuse.

 


शराब और नशे की लत की यह समस्या इतनी बड़ी है कि सिर्फ सरकार या उसकी एजेंसियों के प्रयास ही पर्याप्त नहीं होंगे। इस चुनौती के समाधान के लिए NGOs तथा समर्पित व्यक्तियों, विशेषज्ञों की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका होगी।

 

मुझे विश्वास है कि मादक पदार्थों के सेवन तथा अवैध तस्करी के विरूद्ध अंतरराष्ट्रीय दिवस के अवसर पर यह आयोजन इस दिशा में एक महत्वपूर्ण प्रयास सिद्ध होगा।


The magnitude of the challenge posed by drug abuse is so huge that efforts of the Governmental agencies alone will not suffice. The NGOs and other dedicated individuals also have a great responsibility in eradicating this menace.

 

I believe that the observance of the “International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking” will go a long way in meeting this end.

 


Jai Hind!”

Shri Naidu also suggested to the minister to undertake a review of the Import-Export Policy and protect the interests of the farming community.

While appreciating that many assurances were fulfilled regarding the setting up of national institutions and sanctioning of new projects to Andhra Pradesh, Shri Naidu stressed the need to provide a helping hand to the State.

The Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH Shri Shripad Yesso Naik also called on the Vice President.

He also reminded the minister about the assurance to set up a Central Research Institute of Yoga & Naturopathy (CRIYN) with 100-bedded IPD Hospital at Kondapavuluru in Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh. He told the minister that the Department of AYUSH, government of Andhra Pradesh had allotted free of cost 25 acres and the land was also registered under Central Council of Research in Yoga and Naturopathy in 2018 itself.

The Vice President also reminded the Minister that he had suggested in the past for laying the foundation at the earliest after Former Health Minister of Andhra Pradesh Shri Kamineni Srinivas represented the matter. Later, the announcement was made by the Union Minister.

The Minister of State for Steel, Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste also called on the Vice President. Shri Naidu enquired with him about the status of the proposal to setup a steel plant in Kadapa District of Andhra Pradesh.

The Minister assured the Vice President that he would take up the issue with the Union Minister for Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan and also discuss with senior officials.

                The Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has cautioned MPs about the growing perception that democracy is in danger through “dysfunctional legislatures” and advised them to recalibrate their ways of thinking and acting.

In his observations to the House, Shri Naidu recalled the concern he had expressed time and again about disruptions and the negative public perception arising out of “this dysfunctional state of affairs”.

Observing that substantial loss of functional time results in very low productivity, pendency of crucial legislations and lapse of some Bills on dissolution of the Lok Sabha, he said that every Question Hour lost means an opportunity to seek answers from the government on eight issues of policy implementation and governance by 40 members.

Stating that he was deeply disturbed by the recent happenings in the House, the Chairman said that people were equally getting disturbed and disillusioned with the way the House was functioning.

“The trust and confidence of people in our institutions is getting eroded. This downslide should end,” he added. 

Pointing out that people of the country want the august House to be a performing one, Shri Naidu said as the House of Elders, we need to lead by example. This is a privilege that people bestow on a few. The expectations are high. He warned “If we fail we fail our people, we fail our nation, and we cannot allow this to happen”

Appealing to all Parliamentarians to make an inspiring fresh beginning with this session, he said “Our Parliament over the next few years has a very crucial role to play in the making of a New India by 2022 in which we all can take pride.”

Observing that India was an aspirational country with youth consisting almost two thirds of our population, he said citizens want to be active partners in development.

“Against this backdrop, we have to make our systems work better, make the institutions respond faster and the governance patterns altered to become more citizen-centric. We, in the Parliament, have an onerous responsibility,” he added.

Reminding the members that Rajya Sabha, being the house of elders has an added responsibility, he said “people expect from us a mature outlook, dispassionate and sensitive contemplation and meaningful deliberations on issues of public importance. We have to live up to their expectations and be role models for other legislatures.”

The Rajya Sabha Chairman also sought members suggestions on the automatic lapsing of bills in Rajya Sabha and on how to make Parliament a more effective forum of decision making. 

The following is the full text of the observations made: 

Respected Leader of the House Shri Thawar Chand Gehlot ji, Respected Leader of the Opposition Shri Ghulam Nabi Azad ji, Leaders of various parties in the House and Hon’ble Members of the August House !

I extend a warm welcome to all of you to this important 249th session of the House - the first session after the recent general elections and constitution of the 17th Lok Sabha. Though Rajya Sabha is a continuous House, this, in a way, is a new beginning for us as well.

Almost every one of you have been very actively involved in the recent elections reaching out to the people and gaining a deeper understanding of the hopes and aspirations of the people in a rapidly changing India. 

Our country is set on yet another five year journey of making it’s tryst with destiny. Such a journey after every general election is always a defining moment in the making of our nation. It is a moment of honest reflection, renewed commitment and buoyant hope. The vibrant democracy of our country and the mandate given by the people gives us the confidence that, as a nation, we can make a huge leap and make the desired transformation happen, peacefully, harmoniously, inclusively and sustainably. 

This is what the people of India want today.  They want country to progress on different dimensions.  They want a transparent, responsive, agile governance.  They want the quality of their lives to improve.  They want their voices to be heard. That’s where the role of all of us, Parliamentarians, comes in. To give voice to those ideas, those emotions, those yearnings for positive change.

Hon’ble Members,

You are the representatives of the people who have reposed their faith in you. When you enter the portals of this hallowed building, you bring with you millions of hopes and expectations from your respective constituencies. We have, therefore, a collective responsibility to live up to these expectations. 

We have, now, yet another opportunity to redeem our pledges to the people and the nation by debating issues of public importance, seeking solutions to intractable challenges and formulating laws that improve governance and the quality of the polity as well as transform the lives of people. 

Hon’ble Members, since my assumption of the Office of the Chairman of this august House, I have been expressing time and again, my concern about disruptions of the proceedings of the House and the negative public perception arising out of this dysfunctional state of affairs.   Substantial loss of functional time results in very low productivity, pendency of crucial legislations and the resultant lapse of some of these Bills on dissolution of the Lok Sabha. 

Every Question Hour lost means an opportunity of seeking answers from the government on 8 issues of policy, implementation and governance by 40 members. Every Zero Hour lost means depriving 15 members from raising issues of immediate public importance. Similarly, if the House doesn’t function, about ten more members lose the opportunity of raising as many issues in the House. 
Ultimately, this august House would be what you want it to be. A performing one or a dysfunctional one. People of the country want it to be a performing one. If you have other ideas, you owe an explanation to the people, the ultimate masters. There is a growing perception that our democracy is in danger through dysfunctional legislatures.

Our nation has just entered the 70th year of Republic. Legislatures and their Hon’ble Members should discharge their noble responsibilities. As the House of Elders, we need to lead by example. This is a privilege that people bestow on a few. The expectations are high. Our responsibilities are onerous. We can ill afford to regret over lost opportunities we have had. 

If we fail, we fail our people, we fail our nation.  We cannot allow this to happen.  We need to reassure each citizen that we can bring about a distinct change and that change shall begin with each political party and each member of this House. 

Hon’ble Members,

Thorough, carefully considered and expeditious disposal of business is the touchstone of our efficiency.  

In this context, I would like to mention a few issues that seem to be impeding speedy passing of Bills. 


	The Bills passed by the Lok Sabha and pending in the Rajya Sabha lapse with the dissolution of the House of the People. They have to be reintroduced in the Lok Sabha and the entire process has to be gone through afresh. This means a lot of delay. Can we make any change in this regard?
	The Houses of Parliament seems to lose a lot of time in disruptive expression of adversarial positions.  Can we change this approach and improve the quality of debates and make decision making a little quicker than now? 
	Quite a few bills are pending in Rajya Sabha for decades without required consideration. Should we continue them or treat them as lapsed?


Let me elaborate on each one of them and suggest we collectively think of feasible solutions to each of them. 

Dissolution of Lok Sabha and lapsing of Bills in Rajya Sabha

Under the provision of Article 107 of the Constitution, Bills passed by the Lok Sabha during the course of it’s five year term and pending in Rajya Sabha get lapsed with the dissolution of the House of the People. Accordingly, 22 Bills passed by the 16th Lok Sabha and were pending in the Upper House got lapsed. 

In effect, Lok Sabha has to take up these 22 Bills again for consideration and passing. I am afraid it would take a minimum of two sessions for doing so. And this means that the efforts of Lok Sabha for passing these 22 Bills have been rendered waste. The Bills that got lapsed in Rajya Sabha were important from the socio-economic transformation of our country. 

The lapsed Bills include; 


	The Land Acquisition Bills passed by Lok Sabha in 2015,
	Factories (Amendment) Bill passed in 2016,
	The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017,
	The Consumer Protection Bill, 2018,
	The Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2018,
	The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2019,
	The Banning of Unregulated Deposit schemes Bill, 2019,
	The Aadhar and Other Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2019,
	Triple Talaq Bills of 2017 and 2018,
	The Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018,
	The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 etc.


As all of you would appreciate, it takes considerable time and energy to get a Bill passed in either of the Houses of Parliament. Given the implications for the functioning of the Parliament and the impact of the Bills getting lapsed on the much desired transformation of our country, there is a need to rethink the provision regarding the lapsing of the Bills in the Upper House of the Parliament.

I suggest a wider debate on the matter of automatic lapsing of Bills in Rajya Sabha. 

Pendency of Bills in Rajya Sabha

At the end of the last and the 248th session of Rajya Sabha, a total of 55 Bills were pending consideration in this House. After the lapsing of the 22 Bills that were referred to earlier, the pendency in this House now stands at 33 Bills. Three bills are pending for more than 20 years, six bills are pending between 10-20 years, 14 bills are pending between 5-10 years and 10 bills are pending for less than 5 years. The oldest pending bill, The Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 1987, has been pending for more than 32 years. This is certainly not a happy situation. These pending Bills include;

 


	The Constitution (79th Amendment) Bill, 1992,
	The Provision of the Municipalities (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Amendment Bill, 2001,
	The Seeds Bill, 2004, The Pesticides Management Bill, 2011,
	The Mines (Amendment) Bill, 2011, The Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Amendment) Bill, 2011,
	The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Amendment Bill, 2012,
	The Building and Other Construction Workers Related Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2013,
	The Wakf Properties (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Bill, 2014 etc. 


As the titles suggest, all these long pending Bills relate to important issues that merit timely consideration and passing. Such long pendency does not reflect well on the functioning of the Parliament.

In order to streamline the process, I suggest that if a Bill is not taken up for consideration and passing in Rajya Sabha within five years of introduction of such Bills, such pending Bills should be treated as deemed to have lapsed. Let us have a wider debate in this regard as well. 

Parliament: How do we make it a more effective forum of debate and decision making?  How do we seek the “meeting ground” rather than the “zone of divergence”?

Hon’ble Members !

I would, now, like to invite your attention to another important dimension of the functioning of our Parliament. 

We should examine the reasons why there was a wide gap between the number of bills passed by the 16th Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, especially when compared to the 15th Lok Sabha. 

I am not for a moment suggesting that one House of the Parliament should blindly follow the other House. Careful consideration by both Houses is absolutely required. Informed debates and reasoned argumentation is the heart of Parliamentary democracy. 

During the debates in the Constituent Assembly and thereafter on the need for second chamber of Parliament i.e Rajya Sabha, several luminaries including Dr.S.Radhakrishnan stressed that Rajya Sabha should act  as a ‘check’ on the hasty legislation spurred by the possible political considerations in the other House but not to obstruct the very course of legislation by the Parliament. 

All the stakeholders need to give a serious thought to this decision making process and see if dialogue and debate can follow the path of consensus building and searching for the ‘meeting ground’ or the ‘zone of convergence’ rather than expanding the ‘zone of divergence’. 

Verdict 2019: The Message and Mission for Parliament

While every electoral verdict carries its own message to those who are elected, we have now a different context in India. Ours is an aspirational country with youth consisting almost two thirds of our population. This is a huge untapped demographic dividend. We have an increasingly active citizenry wishing to be active partners in development and expecting efficient delivery of services and expeditious delivery of justice.  Against this backdrop, we have to make our systems work better, make the institutions respond faster and the governance patterns altered to become more citizen-centric. We, in the Parliament, have an onerous responsibility. 

The Mission before all of us now is to clear all the cobwebs and remove hurdles that come in the way of rapid socio-economic transformation of our country. 

To realize the vaulting aspirations of our people cutting across the boundaries of caste, creed, region and religion, Parliamentarians need to redefine and recalibrate their ways of thinking and acting and have to make a clear break from the past. 

We have to be more agile, forward looking and capitalize on our collective wisdom. NITI Ayog and the Government have come out with a vision and a set of goals for 2022. Our Parliament over the next few years has a very crucial role to play in the making of a New India by 2022 in which we all can take pride. 

As Vice President of India and Chairman of this august House and as an individual with some years of experience in public life, I fervently appeal to all Parliamentarians to make an inspiring fresh start beginning with this session. 

It should be our collective duty to strive for better and effective performance.  Rajya Sabha, being the House of Elders, has an added responsibility as a deliberative body and the people expect from us a mature outlook, dispassionate and sensitive contemplation and meaningful deliberations on issues of public importance.  We have to live up to their expectations and be role models for other legislatures.  The quality of our discourse and the way we conduct ourselves will define our contribution to public life.

I want that every issue be discussed and debated with utmost passion and sincerest conviction in this august House. I would certainly welcome such an enlightened debate because this will undoubtedly enhance the stature of this House.  

Let us make our Parliament an institution that synergises our individual, intellectual and political thoughts and actions for the betterment of the lives of our people and for transforming our country to be among the best in the world. 

It is an opportune time for us to reform the functioning of our Parliament so that we can collectively transform the lives of our people who have reposed immense trust in each one of us. Please think of every Indian before you debate or disrupt. Think of the India you wish to create.

We are all fortunate to have an opportunity to shape our country’s destiny, an opportunity that comes rarely to only a select few. We must use it wisely. 

The present dysfunctional, disruptive environment must change.

We must use the time available for Parliamentary debates most productively.  Infact, we may actually require more time given the ever widening range of public issues emerging every day.  However, our foremost task is to use the existing time in a fruitful manner. 

I have been getting deeply disturbed by the recent happenings in the House and I get a feeling that many people are getting equally disturbed and disillusioned with the way the House is functioning.  The trust and confidence of people in our institutions is getting eroded.  This downslide should end.  

We cannot allow any further weakening of our democratic structures.  Together, we must restore the stature and dignity of the House and set an example to other legislative bodies in the country. I urge all political parties to reflect on the current decline and stem the rot as soon as possible. Let us show that change is possible and that we can make it happen. 

I fervently hope that the issues I have raised and concerns I have voiced will receive utmost consideration by all of you and other stakeholders. 

Thank you for your patient hearing. 

Jai Hind !

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for popularizing Yoga and making it part of the school curriculum to promote healthy lifestyles and combat growing incidence of non-communicable diseases in the country. 

Participating in the International Yoga Day celebrations organized by Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Vishwa Vidyalaya at the historic Red Fort grounds, here today, the Vice President said the ancient Indian practice not only ensures physical fitness and mental equilibrium but also inculcates discipline. He urged the Centre and various State Governments to make yoga part of the school curriculum.

Observing that improper food habits were causing harm to health, Shri Naidu cautioned the people, particularly the youngsters against eating junk food. “Instant food means constant disease”, he said the indigenous food practices handed down by our forefathers suited each season and region and need to be adopted.

Pointing out that people are encountering tremendous pressures in daily lives, the Vice President said there is a great need to introduce to the subtle science of Yoga, which everyone can use not just to achieve physical well-being, but also to lead a better life by making enlightened choices.

Observing that Yoga entails simplicity, honesty, compassion, and respect for all creatures and nature, Shri Naidu said the single-dimensional pursuit for more resources, wealth, pleasure and power was leading to erosion of values, ethics and indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources. “We are now seeing the result of all this in the form of climate change and growing inequalities. We need to arrest this craving for materialistic pursuits”, he added.

The Vice President said that Yoga aims at ‘balance’ and ‘equanimity’ and called for avoiding reckless exploitation of nature and excessive consumption. “Sustainability has to be the new mantra. ‘Balance’ is at the heart of sustainability. And that ‘balance’ in all spheres starting with physical well - being is what yoga is all about”, the Vice President stressed.

Stating that Yoga reflects the Bharatiya way of life of co-existing harmoniously with the nature and all other living creatures, Shri Naidu said that a true yogi develops harmonious relationships with the self, others and the environment that form the foundation of healthy societies and a healthy planet. ‘We must love and live with nature, nature and culture for a better future”, he added.

Expressing his happiness over the increasing popularity of Yoga all over the globe, the Vice President said that it was a matter of pride for the country that following Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s initiative, the International Day of Yoga is being celebrated across the world every year on June 21.

The Vice President also practiced a few Yoga Asanas on the occasion along with 30 thousand Yoga Sadhakas gathered at the celebration. 

Later, a book titled ‘Siridhanyalu (Millets) - Food That Heals” was presented by Dr. Kahdar Vali, a proponent of healthy food habits and Shri Venkateshwar, Chairman of Rythu Nestham Foundation to the Vice President.

The Chief of Brahma Kumaris, Mount Abu, Rajyogini Dadi Janki, the Director of Om Shanti Retreat Centre, Gurugram, BK Sister Asha, the Regional Coordinator of Brahma Kumaris for Russia and CIS, BK Sister Chakradhari, the Director, Brahma Kumaris Centre, New Delhi, BK Sister Pushpa, the Additional Secretary General, Bhahma Kumaris, Mount Abu, BK Brother Brij Mohan, the National Trustee, Lotus Temple & Baha’i Community of India, Dr. A.K. Merchant, the Head Priest, Gauri Shankar Temple, Chandni Chowk, Pandit Shivanand Mishra, the Priest & Hon. Secretary, Judah Hyam Syngogue, New Delhi, Rabbi Ezekiel Isaac Malekar, the Head Priest, Gurudwara Sisganj Sahib, Chandni Chowk, Delhi, Giani Harnam Singh, the Chancellor of Maulana Azad National Urdu University, Hyderabad, Janab Firoz Bakht Ahmed, the Independent Scientist & Expert on Health & Food, Dr. Khadar Vali, the Chairman of Rythu Nestham Foundation, Shri Venkateshwar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“Learned speakers on the dais and Brahma Kumari Sisters and Brothers in this assembly,

At the outset, I would like to congratulate the Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya for having organized this event at the historic Red Fort Ground and inviting me to be the Chief Guest.

It is a matter of pride for the country that following Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s initiative, the International Day of Yoga is being celebrated across the world every year on June 21. 

It was on December 11th 2014, the U.N. General Assembly approved by consensus a resolution establishing June 21 as ‘International Day of Yoga’. The resolution received backing from 177 countries.

Yoga is now widely recognized as a means to achieve and maintain physical fitness and health. Yoga, however, is not just a form of physical exercise, to be practiced for a few minutesevery day. 

It is a holistic discipline which leads to a healthy state of mind, robust body and complete well-being of an individual.

Yoga also means union – of spirit and matter, thought and action, man and nature. A true yogi develops harmonious relationships with the self, others and the environment that form the foundation of healthy societies and a healthy planet.

Yoga is a way of life that entails simplicity, honesty, compassion, and respect for all creatures and nature. It is a lifestyle based on non-violence at every level – in thoughts, feelings, words and actions.

Yoga advocates that to the extent we reduce the external paraphernalia in our life, and even clear away the clutter of our mind, the more we will be able to concentrate and find inner peace. 

It is this aspect of yoga that needs to be popularized today, when people's outlook and lifestyles have become materialistic. The single-dimensional pursuit for more resources, wealth, pleasure and power is leading to erosion of values, ethics and indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources. We are now seeing the result of all this in the form of climate change and growing inequalities. We need to arrest this craving for materialistic pursuits.

Yoga aims for ‘balance’ and ‘equanimity’, ‘peace’, ‘poise’ and ‘grace’. It is a sublime expression of the quest for excellence, for synthesis and for harmony. It is an eloquent epitome of the Indian world view. It reflects the Bharatiya way of life of co-existing harmoniously with the nature and all other living creatures.

We are living in times of great challenges, of unprecedented change in unpredictable directions.  The way we live, learn, work and enjoy is changing rapidly. The lifestyles are getting transformed through technology. We are making significant progress in our relentless quest for economic growth and prosperity, in enhancing convenience and comfort, in enriching our knowledge and skills, in enlarging our choices for entertainment and education. 

We need to avoid reckless exploitation of nature and excessive consumption. Sustainability has to be the new mantra. ‘Balance’ is at the heart of sustainability. And that ‘balance’ in all spheres starting with physical well - being is what yoga is all about. 

At a time when people are encountering tremendous pressures in daily lives, there is a great need to introduce to the subtle science of yoga, which everyone can use not just to achieve physical well-being, but also to lead a better life by making enlightened choices. 

As we all are aware, Yoga is an ancient physical, mental and spiritual practice that originated in India possibly around the 5th century BC. We need to propagate and preserve this holistic practice by making it a part of the school curriculum as it not only ensures physical fitness and mental equilibrium but also inculcates discipline. This is all the more necessary in the wake of changing lifestyles and growing incidence of non-communicable diseases in the country. 

I have been visiting various foreign countries as part of strengthening bilateral ties with those nations. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Yoga practice has become hugely popular all over the globe. 

I have learnt that quite a few schools in some countries, including the USA have introduced Yoga as a part of the school curriculum for children. I have seen yoga centres in many countries like, for example, Peru. In Costa Rica, a Presidential decree was issued declaring all activities and initiatives related to promotion of Yoga and Meditation to be in public interest.

A yogic perspective enables us to see the wider implications of our actions, and makes us aware of our role and responsibilities as an inseparable part of the universal scheme of things.

I am happy to know that Brahma Kumaris arrange programs on June 21 every year to promote yoga as a healthy way of life combining physical exercise and meditation.

Jaihind!”

The Minister also informed the Vice President about the progress of various defence projects being implemented in the country, including in Andhra Pradesh. 

The Vice President advised the Minister to take a personal interest in expediting the defence projects in Andhra Pradesh, the foundation stones for many of which were laid when Shri Naidu was a Union Minister. He also wanted the Minister to remove impediments, if any, in the execution of the projects.

The projects discussed include BEL’s Advanced Night Vision Devices Factory at Nimmakuru in Krishna district. The factory seeks to cater to the futuristic requirements for night vision devices with an investment of about Rs 300 crores. Apart from Shri Naidu, Former Union Minister, Shri Suresh Prabhu and Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister were present when the foundation stone was laid.

BEL’s Defence Systems Integration Complex at Palasamudram, in Anantapur district also came up for discussion. The state-of-the-art facility will cater to the needs of Missile & Weapon Systems manufacturing for the ongoing and upcoming Missile programmes. The foundation stone was laid by Shri Naidu and the then Defence Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley.

Other projects under consideration include Mishra Dhatu Nigam Limited’s Greenfield Aluminum Alloy Production Plant at Bodduvaripalem in Nellore District, Missile Testing Facility at Nagayalanka in Krishna District, Naval Alternate Operating Base (NAOB) at Rambilli near Vishakapatnam and Naval Air Station at Bobbili in Vizianagaram district.

The Vice President suggested to the Defence Minister to see that these projects are taken up at the earliest. He also wanted him to expedite projects for which sanctions have already been given.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for adopting digital technology to improve governance and timely delivery of services to citizens.

 

Speaking at the inaugural edition of DigiTech Conclave 2019 of The Times Group after launching ET Government portal, in New Delhi today, the Vice President said that technology has been a game changer and was progressively helping in eliminating corruption, ensuring transparency and improving the delivery of services in several areas like healthcare, land registrations, transport, tax collection and urban planning.

 

Citing an instance, Shri Naidu said that adopting digital technology helped the elimination of bogus ration cards and resulted in a saving of Rs.6,000 crore in one State. He expressed confidence that ET Government Portal would go a long way in spreading awareness about the transformative potential of digital technology and also in making governance system more accessible to citizens.

 

Quoting to a recent study conducted by McKinsey Global Institute, the Vice President said that India was the second fastest digitizing economy after Indonesia. He said that digitization has the potential not only to boost core sectors like IT, digital communication, and online retail but also transform financial services, agriculture, logistics and education.

 

Pointing out that India was digitally more connected today than before, Shri Naidu said that digitization could contribute to inclusive development in more ways than one. ‘We have to make this digital delivery and online public interface more universal and more effective,’ he added.

 

Opining that Information Technology sector could greatly contribute to economic prosperity by generating better means of employment, the Vice President said that he was glad that the government was also steering the BPO movement to smaller towns to create employment opportunities and promote the IT-ITeS industry to ensure a balanced regional growth.

 

Shri Naidu also called upon education institutes, the corporate sector, NGOs as also of the Centre and various State governments to impart the necessary skills to our youth, to channelize the energy of these young minds to make India the next economic power. He said that digitization was an important driver of growth as it ensures transparency and builds confidence among investors.

 

Saying that India has always been at the forefront of leveraging technology for development, the Vice President said that investments made by major global tech firms and setting up of their biggest research centers in India was an indication of global recognition of India’s prowess in technology.

 

The Vice President stressed the need to harness the untapped potential of technology to not only improve the ‘ease of business’­ but also utilize its power to enhance people’s ‘ease of living’ and the “happiness quotient”.

 

The Editor, ET Government, Shri T.K. Arun and several other dignitaries attended the event.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am delighted to participate in the launch of ET Government portal and the inaugural edition of DigiTech Conclave 2019 of The Times Group.

 

I am glad that ET Government portal is being launched today.

 

Technology has become so ubiquitous today that no aspect of our daily life is untouched by it. The way we live, learn and work is changing at an unprecedented pace and in unpredictable directions.

 

Governance and management of programmes as well as delivery of services to the citizens are also swiftly getting transformed. The processes are getting more citizen-centric and citizen-friendly. Technology has been a game-changer and is progressively helping in eliminating corruption, ensuring transparency and improving delivery of services in several areas like healthcare, land registrations, transport, tax collection and urban planning.

 

When I was the Minister for Urban Development, I suggested that we tap into the unrealised potential of technologies in implementing the Smart Cities initiative. Similarly, Digital India, Make in India and Start up India, among others, are examples of the Government’s effort to advance technology-led governance reform initiatives.

 

I am glad to know that this conference is focusing on digital technology and is being supported by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India, Government of Telangana and Government of Uttar Pradesh along with other organisations. The ET Government Portal will also go a long way in spreading awareness about the transformative potential of digital technology and making governance system more accessible to all citizens.

 

Dear sisters and brothers,

 

India has always been at the forefront of leveraging technology for development and governance. From being a software services hub, we are now becoming the research hub. Recognising India’s core competence, many global tech firms have established some of their biggest research centres in India.

 

Indian government is making rapid progress towards improving the economy and ensuring a general level of prosperity in tune with the philosophy of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas.

 

By creating a conducive environment and adopting right policies and regulations, India is now making pioneering efforts to improve the infrastructure needed for development with a citizen-centric approach. This is evident from the fact that over the past few years, there has been a huge growth in a more effective technology-mediated citizen services delivery.

 

Dear friends,

 

India is more digitally connected today than ever before. Undoubtedly, digitization is ensuring speedy delivery of services, apart from transforming the banking and financial sectors. It is contributing to inclusive development in more ways than one.

 

The JAM trinity- Jandhan, AADHAAR and Mobile is enabling timely delivery of services and disbursal of benefits directly to the accounts of the targeted recipients. We have to make this digital delivery and online public interface more universal and more effective. 

 

A recent study of 17 mature and emerging economies, including the US, UK, China, and Brazil conducted by McKinsey Global Institute has found that India is the second fastest digitizing economy after Indonesia.

 

The fast-growing digitization of the Indian economy has the potential to not only boost core sectors like IT, digital communication, and online retail but also transform several other areas of the economy — financial services, agriculture, logistics and education.

 

Digitization is an important driver of growth. It ensures transparency and builds confidence among investors.

 

The Digital India Programme of the Government aims to transform India into a knowledge-based economy and digitally empowered society by ensuring digital access, digital inclusion, digital empowerment and bridging the digital divide.

 

Through Aadhaar, the Government has provided digital identity to 122.9 crore residents of the country with 99% coverage of the adult population as on 30th November 2018.

 

Similarly, India’s unique payment systems such as BHIM-UPI and BHIM-Aadhaar are getting recognized globally. Over the past four years, digital payment transactions have grown multi-fold from 316 crore transactions in 2014-15 to 2071 crore transactions in 2017-18.

 

I am also glad that the government is also steering the BPO movement to smaller towns to create employment opportunities and promote the IT-ITeS industry to ensure a balanced regional growth.

 

I have been told that under India BPO Promotion Scheme, 45, 840 seats were allocated to 163 companies, resulting in setting up of 240 units across 110 locations of 20 States & 2 UTs.

 

BPOs are promoting local entrepreneurs and employment to women and differently-abled. BPOs have started operations at several locations, including, Bhaderwah, Budgam, Jammu, Sopore and Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, Guwahati, Kohima, Imphal in North-Eastern region, Baddi and Shimla in Himachal Pradesh, Patna and Muzaffarpur in Bihar, Jaleshwar in Odisha.

 

Dear sisters and brothers,

 

Information Technology sector can greatly contribute to economic prosperity by generating better means of employment. Such technologies can also enrich people's lives by providing greater choice and by supporting social, welfare and cultural activities.

 

More than 60% of our population is under the age of 30 years. We need to channelize the energy of these young minds to make India the next economic power. For achieving that, we have to impart the necessary skills to our youth. In this endeavour, the role of the education institutes, the corporate sector, NGOs as also of the Centre and various State governments becomes critical.

 

Dear sisters and brothers,

 

India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

 

The World Bank's Economic Prospects Report released recently observed that the Indian economy grew by 7.2 per cent in 2018-19 and is expected to grow by 7.5 per cent in the next two fiscal years.

 

With reforms like GST, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code, Single Window Clearance and improvement in the ease of doing business in the country, India is at the cusp of becoming an economic power. We all need to now work together to achieve this goal.

 

Technology is a great democratic tool. It is not only an enabler but also an equalizer, which can help a billionaire as also the poorest of poor. Ultimately governance is about people and the quality of their lives.  It is this quality that needs to be impacted and transformed for the better. The delivery of services needs to be significantly streamlined and made as citizen friendly as possible. 

 

We must harness the untapped potential of technology to not only improve the ‘ease of business’ which we are doing very effectively now but also move beyond to other spheres of life and utilize its power to enhance people’s ‘ease of living’ and the “happiness quotient”.

 

Let me conclude by congratulating Times Group for starting a new vertical that will cater to the government sector. I hope that the reports, news, views and information that you present will help government in policy formulation and improving the efficiency and efficacy of governmental schemes and programmes.

 

Thank you.

 

Jai Hind!""

                Continuing his interaction with the newly elected Ministers in the Union Cabinet, the Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu interacted with three Ministers in different endearments, here today. Shri Naidu complemented the Ministers for the contribution made by their respective ministries in India’s progress and advised them to take all the necessary steps to improve the life of common man.

The newly elected Minister of Food Processing and Industries, Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal along with the Mister of State, Shri Rameswar Teli called on the Vice President at his residence and apprised him of the developmental activities undertaken by their ministry and also informed the Vice President about the future plans of the ministry to boost the food processing sector in India, especially through public private partnership.

Opining that the food processing sector could supplement on-farm income and help in farmers double their incomes, Shri Naidu advised the Minister to educate and empower the farming community to focus on food processing to ensure value addition to agricultural produce and make farmers as active partners in food processing.

The Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Shri Mahendranath Panday also called on the Vice President and told him about government’s initiatives on skill development to realize the demographic dividend. Shri Naidu also advised the minister to scale up skill development activities and enhance industry institutional linkages. The Vice President opined that Skill development is the key catalyst for India’s future.

During his interaction with the Minister of Law and Justice, Communications and Electronics and Information technology, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, the Vice President enquired about SAMEER (Society for Applied Microwave Electronic Engineering and Research) in Andhra Pradesh.

The Minister apprised the Vice President that the 80 crores worth project established at Gambheeram near Vizag is nearly complete and functioning.

Foundation Stone of SAMEER Centre for Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) at Visakhapatnam was laid on 18th February 2016 by the Vice President, when he was the Union Minister for Urban Development.

The Vice President also underscored the importance of addressing the issue of expediting election petitions and criminal cases especially related to the heinous category as well as a time-bound disposal of cases under anti-defection laws.

                The Vice President of India, Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for the revamping of our entire education system to equip our youth with the knowledge, skills and attitudes required for the 21st century. He was inaugurating the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of Sri Satya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, in Bengaluru today.

Terming the completion of 50 years, as a ‘crucial milestone’ in the journey of the institution, Shri Naidu said that the achievement was an eloquent testimony to the enduring vision of Sri Satya Sai Baba, an extraordinary guru and a transformational leader, who inspired millions of people across the globe to actively participate in the service of humanity.

The Vice President asserted that education is one of the major catalysts of growth and added that nations prosper only when its citizens become educated. Quoting the Kothari Commission’s report of 1964-68 which laid down the country’s education policy, Shri Naidu said that the destiny of our country shaped in our classrooms.

Referring to the draft National Education policy 2019 that covers a whole range of issues in great detail, the Vice President spoke about the need to aim for excellence and equity and strikes a balance between the national needs and ethos and the need to prepare our students to be among the best in the global context.

Shri Naidu called for a pragmatic language policy in which mother tongue and other languages are given due importance in order to help our youth excel in a multilingual world.

Highlighting India’s improving literacy rate, the Vice President said that in the next few years, we must ensure that our population can read, write, compute, articulate and participate with greater self-confidence in the developmental processes.

The Vice President opined that our school system must be more child friendly and geared towards a holistic development of each child’s innate faculties and that our higher education system needs to be re-engineered to bring in greater emphasis on excellence in research and teaching. He emphasized that the crucial responsibility of molding the future rests upon us collectively and asserted that we must not fail. He spoke of the need to draw inspiration from our country’s great heritage and blend it with the best elements of thought and action from around the globe.

Stating that India is today a knowledge-based economy, the Vice President said that we cannot afford to have a mediocre or qualitatively sub-optimal system of education, if we are to thrive in this rapidly changing world. He called for a much larger number of educational institutions that focus on all round development of an individual’s personality. ‘The head, hand and heart must develop simultaneously’, he added.

Opining that good quality education gave us the ability to sift the chaff from the grain, Shri Naidu said that it would also liberate us from ignorance, superstition, bigotry, prejudices and narrow tunnel vision.

The Vice President also said that intellectual brilliance must be combined with good deeds and compassionate behavior. Quoting Sri Satya Sai Baba’s words: “Education is for life not merely for living”, he said that education must be as ‘transformational’ and not merely ‘transactional’. He applauded the Sri Satya Sai Institute of Higher Learning for continually striving for excellence in education.

The Chancellor of Sri Satya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, Shri Chakravarthi, the Vice Chancellor of Sri Satya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, Prof. K.B.R. Verma, the Trustees of Sri Satya Sai Trust, Shri R.S. Ratnakar & Shri Naganand and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am extremely happy to be with all of you at the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of Sri Satya Sai Institute of Higher Learning (SSSIHL).

Completion of 50 years, the celebration of the Golden Jubilee is a crucial milestone in the journey of this educational institution.

It is an eloquent testimony of the enduring vision of Sri Satya Sai Baba, an extraordinary guru who inspired millions of people across the globe to actively participate in the service of humanity.

He was a transformational leader who established educational institutions and hospitals and demonstrated to the world how values can be inculcated through education and how healthcare can be delivered to the poor.

I am glad this institution initially set up as Sri Satya Sai Arts and Science College on 9th June 1969 has made a mark for itself.

It’s heartening to hear that the students of the Institute have been serving their motherland in various capacities, as members of the armed forces, civil service officers, advocates, judges, scientists, researchers, academicians, entrepreneurs and members of the Indian diaspora.

I am happy to note that the small seed sown by Baba fifty years ago has now grown into a Kalpavriksha, a tree that gives limitless fruits of knowledge and is in full bloom with countless flowers spreading the fragrance of peace and wisdom.

Good quality education is truly a Kalpavriksha for the individual, for a country, a nation and for the world. It is a unique treasure.  As the ancient Indian Subhashita goes,

“Vyaye krute vardhathaevanityam

Vidya dhanam sarvadhana pradhaanam”

“Of all the treasures, education is the most important and most crucial. It is unique because more you share it with others, the more it grows”.

Education is, indeed, one of the major catalysts of growth. The countries prosper once its citizens become educated. Studies have shown that the phenomenal growth of countries in East Asia was largely due their educational progress. As one recent OECD study conducted in 2012 showed, “on average, about half of the economic growth is related to labour income growth at the tertiary level of education.”

Kothari Commission’s report of 1964-68 which laid down the country’s education policy, had started with the opening statement that, “the destiny of our country is being shaped in our classrooms.”

We, in India, are now embarking on a major reform process. You would have read about the draft National Education policy that has been released for public debate a few days ago. It is a document that covers a whole range of issues in great detail. It seeks to lay out a path for making quality education accessible to all children and youth. It looks at the need to aim for excellence and equity. It strikes a balance between the national needs and ethos and the need to prepare our students to be among the best in the global context. It calls for a pragmatic language policy in which mother tongue is given its due importance and so also is proficiency in other languages required to advance in a multilingual world.

The report comes at a crucial time in India’s developmental journey.

Today’s India is a young India. It has more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35. This is a huge untapped demographic dividend. To realize this dividend, we need to invest in education.  

We must ensure our education system is revamped to equip our young children and youth with the knowledge, skills and attitudes required for the 21st century. 

The foundations of this structure must be strengthened. 

India’s literacy rate is at 74.04%. The youth literacy rate, measured within the age group of 15 to 24, is 81.1%. We must ensure that in the next few years, we have a population that can read and write, to compute, to articulate and participate with greater self-confidence in the developmental processes. 

Our school system must be more child friendly and geared towards a holistic development of each child’s innate faculties. 

Our higher education system needs to be re-engineered to bring in greater emphasis on excellence in research and teaching. 

The draft National Education Policy 2019 contains a number of recommendations that will potentially advance the education agenda of the country and help India move towards a higher growth trajectory. 

These suggestions of the expert panel have to be studied by all the stakeholders in the country, the parents, the students, the educators, the educational administrators and all those who care for the future of our country. 

There must be an active engagement with key issues raised in the draft policy.  We all must look forward with buoyant and create the India of the future by taking some bold, ambitious decisions on education today. 

The draft policy is an excellent occasion for us to take stock of what has been achieved and also shape the future.  I do hope eminent institutes like yours will also contribute to this national dialogue. 

As our economy becomes more robust and resilient, as we keep reforming each of our governance structures and trying to transform the lives of our citizens, as we gain greater stature in the comity of nations, the education system, the catalytic development accelerator should be further activated and given utmost attention.

We have to shape the future. The onus of molding the future is upon us collectively and we must not fail.

It is time that we re-think, re-imagine and re-invent our entire education system.

Your institution has already shown some promising directions.

You have demonstrated as to how we can draw inspiration from our country’s great heritage and blend it with  the best elements of thought and action from around the globe.

You have consistently strived to nurture creativity and imagination in our youngsters and opened up innumerable opportunitiesfor creative self-expression, all round growth and optional development of multiple competencies.

Shri Satya Sai Baba had a grandiose vision of education, a vision that integrated diverse strands of human life and experience.  For him, education was for life not merely for living.

Education as practiced in your institution is ‘transformational’. It is not merely ‘transactional’.

It is not merely passing on of information or imparting knowledge or refining your skills.  It is much more than that. 

It is what makes each one of you realize your true potential. In a way, as Swami Vivekananda also said, it is a process by which all your hidden talents are discovered, by which the perfection you already have within you is realised.

The way we think, the way we learn, the way we talk, the way we respond to external events and the way we lead our lives gets transformed with sound education.

Let me quote Baba’s words here. He had said in his characteristic style, “I want my students to have the head of Sankara, the hands of Janaka and the heart of Buddha.” What he was implying was that intellectual brilliance must be combined with good deeds and compassionate behavior. For Baba, each of us is inherently divine and if we can combine education with devotion, we can realize those divine qualities.

My dear sisters and brothers,

We are today in a knowledge based economy.  To thrive in this rapidly changing world, we cannot afford to have a mediocre or qualitatively sub-optimal system of education.

Doing things better, doing things which have not been done earlier, doing multiple things at the same time, we have to recast the education system.

Islands of excellence like your institution can be effective light houses.  We need to have many more such lighthouses and, ultimately, we should have a much larger number of educational institutions that focus on all round development of an individual’s personality.

The head, hand and heart must develop simultaneously. One should devote as much time on non-cognitive aspects as on the cognitive dimension. Since life is multi-dimensional, education too must remain multi-dimensional.

Our ancient sages have said, “SaaVidyaaYaaVimuktaye” (Good education is the one which liberates). There is an emancipatory quality about education. It gives us freedom to choose, freedom to think and freedom to act. It gives us the ability to sift the chaff from the grain. Good quality education liberates us from ignorance, superstition, bigotry, prejudices and narrow tunnel vision.  This is the kind of education which we must impart in our schools and colleges. This is the education that Baba had also envisaged.  He had said, “In this institute, the medium of instruction is discipline. The first, second and third languages are love, service and Sadhana.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has expressed his concern over political discourse reaching a new low in recent years and called for reversing the disturbing trend at the earliest.

Speaking at the Hyderabad Management Association’s 46th Annual Awards function in Hyderabad today, the Vice President who is also the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, expressed his distress over frequent disruptions of Parliament and state legislatures.

Shri Naidu opined that reducing the pious, legitimate forums to ‘disruptive platforms’ was a clear negation of the vision of our Constitutional makers. “In a way, it is an affront to the spirit of the Constitution of India. It is apathy towards the hopes and aspirations of the people. It is an utter disregard for people’s mandate. It is a betrayal of the people’s faith in these pillars of democracy,” he bemoaned.

Shri Naidu said that people in public life must understand that they were only rivals and not enemies. Quoting the former President, Shri Pranab Mukherjee’s advice, he said “Discuss Debate and Decide but not Disturb” should be the best way forward for the effective functioning of institutions. 

Observing that dysfunctional legislatures will strengthen the demand for ‘recall of legislators’, the Vice President said “I am afraid that we are moving towards that stage”. He said the presiding officers of legislative bodies must decide anti-defection cases within three months. Similarly, election petitions and criminal cases against political leaders must be decided quickly by special benches of higher courts in a time-bound manner, Shri Naidu added.

The Vice President said that the people have made their choice with a resounding clarity in the recent elections and voted for stability and continuity. He opined that the nation must step up the relentless crusade against hunger, poverty, illiteracy and disease and translate the economic growth into happiness for the masses through good health, education, employment, improved infrastructure and amenities. 

The Vice President said that one way of achieving that goal was through enlightened and efficient management practices both in the private as well as the public sector. Bodies like the HMA must use management as a tool for transformation of the economy and the society, he added. 

Observing that GST was a revolutionary taxation measure, the Vice President lauded the managerial and leadership skills of former Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley in bringing 17-year-long discussions to fruition under the guidance of Prime Minster Shri Narendra Modi. Stating that all decisions in 34 meetings of GST Council were taken unanimously without voting, he said “that is greatness of management”.

Referring to the World Bank’s latest forecast, Shri Naidu said that the whole world was looking towards India for investments and stressed that it was the time to accelerate the reforms initiated by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to make India the third largest economy in the coming years.

Urging the public and the private sectors to complement each other’s work and learn from each other’s experience, Shri Naidu said that strong principles of corporate governance must be the driving force of any company. “The principles of transparency, integrity, ethics and honesty must be upheld at all times and must be reflected in every business activity”, he emphasized. 

Observing that India simply cannot allow scams, frauds, scandals to happen at this crucial juncture of our development, Shri Naidu said financial fugitives, who defraud shareholders and other stakeholders of a company, must be brought to justice before they seek safe havens abroad.

The Vice President also presented awards in various categories, including Manager of Year-2018 to Shri Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary to Government of Telangana.

The President of Hyderabad Management Association, Shri Ravi Kumar Peesapati, members of the association and several other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

""I am delighted to be here at the Hyderabad Management Association’s 46th Annual Awards Function. 

I am happy to know that a number of managers, entrepreneurs, technocrats and business persons are being honored here today for their stellar contributions to industry and commerce. 

At the outset, let me congratulate each one of the achievers for exceptional accomplishments in their chosen fields. 

My dear Sisters and brothers, 

Today, India is home to the fastest growing economy in the world. The latest report of the World Bank has mentioned that Indian economy grew by 7.2 per cent and that it is expected to grow by 7.5 per cent in the next two fiscal years. 

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) too forecast that India would continue to be the world's fastest growing major economy and that India’s growth rate would touch 7.5 per cent by 2020. The report highlights India as the bright spot amidst the otherwise bleak global economic growth prospects. 

We have improved our global ranking on most economic indices. Today we are ranked 77th on Global Ease of Doing Business ranking.

As you all are aware, former Prime Minister, late Shri P V Narasimha Rao initiated the liberalization of the Indian economy in the early nineties. It gained momentum under the leadership of late Shri A B Vajpayee, who had ushered in a connectivity revolution giving a huge impetus to the economy.

Now, Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has initiated a series of economic and administrative reforms from tackling the menaces of corruption and black money to ensuring that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong. 

Thanks to these reforms, India has emerged as a top destination for investments in the world.

There is a need to further accelerate reforms as India forges ahead to become the third largest economy in the coming years.

India is today one of the favourite destinations for investments and has become the most attractive emerging market. 

According to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), FDI equity inflows in India in 2018-19 stood at US$ 44.37 billion, indicating that government's effort to improve ease of doing business and relaxation in FDI norms is yielding results. As per a report of UBS, annual FDI inflows in the country are expected to rise to US$ 75 billion over the next five years. 

We are poised to become a US $ 5 Trillion economy in a decade.

Dear sisters and brothers,

Just recently, we have conducted the ‘largest festival of democracy’, the general elections 2019, in a peaceful and orderly manner. The people have made their choice with a resounding clarity and have voted for stability and continuity. 

With a stable government at the centre, it is now up to us to ensure that the momentum of our growth is maintained and enhanced further. Backed by this buoyant growth, we must step up our relentless crusade against hunger, poverty, illiteracy and disease. 

We must translate our economic growth into happiness for the masses through good health, education, employment, improved infrastructure and amenities.  

One way to achieve this goal is through enlightened and efficient management practices both in the private as well as the public sector. 

Dear sisters and brothers,

Managerial and leadership skills are crucial components of good governance. Take the case of GST, for past 17 years discussions were on and many doubts and apprehensions were expressed from time to time. Various State governments expressed fears that theirs powers would be taken away. Similar doubts were also expressed by corporate bodies and social groups. 

The leadership and managerial qualities were best exemplified in the manner in which Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi and former Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley negotiated all obstacles in the implementation of GST and put to rest all fears and doubts on the revolutionary tax reform.

In the 34 GST council meetings held not even once there was a voting, there used to be agreement and disagreement but all these were sorted out by the managerial skills of GST council Chairman Sri Jaitley

In all the sectors of the Indian economy, in both private and public sectors and in all walks of the society, there is a huge scope to enforce optimal utilization of resources and creative management practices. 

I understand that the Hyderabad Management Association has members from the industry, business community, and academia, including students. 

You must leverage the strength of the diversity and collective experience of your members to revolutionize the sphere of management. Bodies like the HMA must use management as a tool for transformation of the economy and the society. 

Management as a discipline is not confined to the corporate sector. The scope of management studies should cover the rural economy, agriculture and allied industry and provide solutions to make these sectors viable and vibrant. 

The principles of management are equally applicable in aspects of public administration. I hope you will look at applying them to a number of specialized areas, such as Entrepreneurship, Energy Management and Healthcare sector. 

Every official in the bureaucracy must remember the face of the common man and strive to bring a smile on his face. The time also has come to rejuvenate the bureaucracy by introducing reforms in selection and cadre allocation and making in-service training mandatory for officials at all levels.

The performance management systems in the bureaucracy can be enhanced with greater focus on outcomes and by recruiting more young people into the system. It is also important to ensure that appointments to important positions are apolitical.

I strongly believe that the public and the private sectors in our country have to work to complement each other and to learn from each other’s experience. The public sector has to utilize the private sector’s expertise in technology, automation, digitization and the ease with which they adopt innovations and adapt quickly to the changing times. The private sector can learn from the best practices of some the reputed public sector organizations. 

As matter-of-fact, management bodies like the HMA must serve as bridges connecting government, industry and academia. They must facilitate effective engagements and provide policy inputs to the government and aid in the implementation of these policies. 

My dear sisters and brothers, 

A company is not all about just profits, market valuations and turnovers; there is a lot that goes into building its position and image.  

Strong principles of corporate governance must be the driving force of any company. The principles of transparency, integrity, ethics and honesty must be upheld at all times and must be reflected in every business activity. 

At this crucial juncture of our development, we simply cannot allow scams, frauds, scandals to happen. Financial fugitives, who defraud shareholders and other stakeholders of a company, must be brought to justice before they seek safe havens in other countries.  

Associations like yours must strive to help the corporate entities to be not only professionally competent but also responsible corporate citizens. The role played by the industry and corporates is of vital importance in protecting and preserving the environment. The principle of sustainable development should be at the core of every activity undertaken by a corporate entity. 

We are witnessing the 4th industrial revolution which is driven by rapidly changing technology with cutting edge innovations such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and Block Chain.  We will have to manage technology driven changes in industrial processes and practices. Every change is potentially disruptive. 

We have to control and manage this disruption. Hence we have to equip ourselves with knowledge and upgrade skills continuously. 

My dear sisters and brothers,

We are also witnessing another type of disruption, which unfortunately is becoming increasingly commonplace. Our legislatures, instead of becoming effective forums of debate, are being reduced to ‘disruptive platforms’. 

This growing tendency, in my view, is a clear negation of the vision of our Constitutional makers. In a way, it is an affront to the spirit of the Constitution of India. It is apathy towards the hopes and aspirations of the people. It is utter disregard for people’s mandate. It is a betrayal of the people’s faith in these pillars of democracy.

Dr. Ambedkar, with great foresight, had warned us almost 70 years ago when he said: “However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However, bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot.”

It is a matter of concern that political discourse is reaching a new low in recent years.  We should reverse this trend at the earliest. A credible opposition is an essential prop for a healthy democracy.

People in public life should understand that they are only rivals, not enemies. I have often been quoting Pranab Da’s mantra-- ‘Discuss, Debate and Decide but not Disturb’.

Functioning of our Parliament and State legislatures has become worrisome with more disruptive and dysfunctional tendencies.

People need to monitor the functioning of the legislatures and also the conduct of various parties and the elected representatives. 

People elect their representatives hoping that they would articulate their hopes and aspirations in the legislatures and do the needful by way of making laws and raising issues of public importance so as to make a difference to their lives. Dysfunctional legislatures strengthen the demand for ‘recall of legislators’. I am afraid that we are moving towards that stage.

As Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, I have tried to be objective and judicious in my response to cases of violation of anti-defection laws. These cases, in my view, require to be dealt with speed and alacrity to uphold the best democratic traditions.

Election petitions and criminal cases against political leaders must be decided quickly by special benches of higher courts in a time-bound manner. If need be, separate benches may be setup to expedite such cases within six months or one year.

Similarly, the presiding officers of legislative bodies need to decide anti-defection cases within three months time.

I am convinced that our country has one of the best Constitutions in the world and we have, over the last 70 years, been translating its intent into policies and programmes. 

We need to now focus on effective implementation and adopt a collaborative approach for speedy development, inclusive development and sustainable development.

Currently, the contribution of women to India’s GDP is 18 percent, one of the lowest proportions in the world, reflecting the fact that only 25 percent of India’s labor force is female. We have to re-write this story and organizations such as yours have a crucial role to play in changing this narrative. 

You also need to sensitize companies about the need to follow an equal, unbiased and fair recruitment policy. Women all over the world have started shattering the glass ceiling. 

India cannot afford to stay behind. We cannot reach the goals of progress we have set for ourselves unless we walk the path of inclusion and social justice. 

I commend apex institutions such as All India Management Association and its affiliated institutions like the HMA for their dedicated service.

Let me once again congratulate all the award winners.

I wish the Hyderabad Management Association all the very best in its future endeavors. 

Thank You-Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for out-of-box ideas and innovations to protect data as new advancements in science and technology would pose a big challenge to cyber security.

Inaugurating a two-day Seminar on “New Paradigms in Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security” organized by C.R.Rao Advanced Institute of Mathematics Statistics and Computer Science, in Hyderabad today, the Vice President expressed concern over the rise in cybercrimes and said that cyber security must be an essential part of our technology culture.

With around 8.4 billion connected devices currently in use across the globe, Shri Naidu observed that traditional cyber security systems were becoming obsolete and stressed the need to constantly update technology, improve software and computing prowess to meet  myriad challenges confronting the world.

Observing that the 21st century has witnessed the creation of disruptive technologies that have caused paradigm shifts in our way of life, the Vice President said that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) were the most exciting of these technologies with potentially endless applications. “These technologies are capable of solving many complex problems of our times”, he added.

Referring to the use of AI and ML in large enterprises, Shri Naidu said “We also, have to explore the possibility of using these technologies in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), small-scale businesses, and seasonal businesses to make the business processes more robust”, he added.

The Vice President also called for making India a global leader in modern, cutting-edge technology with significant investments in research and development. India must also boost exports and soon become a net exporter of technology.

Stating that India embarked on a path of rapid growth and aspiring to raise the economy’s size to nearly USD 4 trillion by 2022-23, Shri Naidu said technology and innovation were crucial to translate India’s growth to make tangible and positive impact on the lives of our people by addressing key development challenges like poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease.

Pointing out that about 600 million young Indians were below 25 years of age, the Vice President said that these technology-savvy youngsters present a demographic dividend and their youthful zeal and acumen must be channelized for national development. 

The Vice President visited the Wireless Communication Lab and High Performance Computing Facility at the Institute and interacted with the Researchers and others. He also visited the Gallery on Dr. C.R. Rao at the Institute and said that he is a great son of this great country and let us all get inspiration from his life. Shri Naidu also visited the e-Learning Centre at the Institute and interacted with the Researchers there and said that these e-learning centres are the powerful medium to achieve the dream of prosperous and peaceful India. 

The Chairman of the Governing Council of C.R. Rao Institute and Member NITI Aayog, Dr. V.K. Saraswat, the ViceChancellor, University of Hyderabad, Prof. Appa Rao Podile, the Director, C.R. Rao Institute, Prof. D.N. Reddy, the Project Director of ARCC, Cmdr. A. Anand, Faculty members, Scientists and Research Fellows were present at the event.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“Invitees, Faculty, Scientists, Research Fellows, Media personnel, sisters and brothers, 

At the outset, I congratulate C.R. Rao Institute for organizing this One Day Seminar on“New Paradigms in Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security”, disciplines which are crucial to the proper functioning of various sectors likebanking, health care, governance and public and private enterprises and in ensuringnational security.

I am delighted to be here at the C R Rao Advanced Institute of mathematics, statistics and computer Science with all of you today. The institute has been named after the Padma Vibhushan Awardee, C R Rao, an eminent Statistician who has won laurels for the country in the field of statistics. I hope that the life and work of Dr. C R Rao will inspire scholars engaged in research activities in this institute to excel in their chosen disciplines. 

My dear sisters and brothers,

India has embarked on a path of rapid growth and development. 

We aspire to achieve a steady economic growth, which will raise the economy’s size in real terms from USD 2.7 trillion in 2017-18 to nearly USD 4 trillion by 2022-23.

We hope to translate this growth into real, tangible and positive impact on the lives of our people by addressing key development challenges like poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease.

Technology and innovation are crucial components of our approach to achieve this goal.

The ‘Strategy for New India @75’ put together by NITI Aayog attempts to bring innovation, technology, enterprise and efficient management together, in an attempt to fast-track growth. 

Technological progress is essential to economic growth and development. 

In addition to fostering economic development, technology helps in improving levels of education and training, aids in addressing social issues, improves connectivity exponentially, strengthens governance and transparency and democratizes knowledge and information. 

Technology can save time, contribute to efficiency of processes and makes businesses and governments more productive.  

Thanks to the increased efficiency of labor with the ever-improving state of technology, businesses are able to increase total output, which in turn leads to higher profits and accelerated growth. 

Better technology has also inspired further research into nearly all domains of human enterprise. 

With About 600 million young people who are below 25 years of age, no country has more youthful energy than India. These technology savvy youngsters present a demographic dividendthat is waiting to be harnessed. The government of India has already embarked upon anambitious initiative to skill these young people. 

We must not fail to channelize their youthful zeal and acumen for national development. 

India must also boost exports and soon be a net exporter of technology. 

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its first bi-monthly monetary policy statement (MPS) 2018-19, speaks about a marked shift in the country’s exports basket -- a clear swing away from primary and traditional low value-added exports to higher value-added manufacturing and technology-driven items. 

We have to sustain this momentum and be a world leader in technology exports. 

The long-term plan should be to invest significantly in research and development so that we could, eventually, be the owners of cutting-edge technology and one of the global industry leaders. 

My dear Sisters and Brothers,

The 21st century has witnessed the creation of disruptive technologies that have caused paradigm shifts in our way of life. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the most exciting of these technologies with potentially endless applications. These technologies are capable of solving many complex problems of our times. 

The reason behindthe popularity of these technologies is that, coupled with advances in data collection and aggregation,they give machines intelligence, enabling high-level cognitive processes like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making. 

They present opportunities to complement and supplement human intelligence and enrich the way people live and work.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are extensively used in large enterprises. We have to explore the possibility of using these technologies in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), small-scale businesses, and seasonal businesses to make the business processes more robust.

The penetration of Information Technology and Internet in all walks of life have made Cyber Security hotly debated topic. 

At present, Cyber security is often an afterthought.We have to change this mindset. Cyber security must be an essential part of our technology culture. 

We must also be intensely aware of the data privacy concerns raised by the infiltration of internet into our daily lives. 

Corporate espionage, spying, financial crimes, identity theft, phishing, privacy compromises and cyber terrorism have become matters of concern from a national, commercial as well as individuals’ perspective. 

The global cybersecurity landscape today is more challenging than it has ever been before. Growing adoption of smart devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a complete dissolution of previously secure network perimeters. 

Small business, organizations, and especially healthcare institutions who cannot afford significant investments in defensive emerging cybersecurity technology such as AI are the most vulnerable.

I am, happy to know that this seminar will discuss the new paradigms of Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security. I hope that this forum will facilitate exchange of knowledge and lead to the shaping of new ideas to combat these threats. 

AI’s massive computing power can support, enhance, and sharpen the capabilities of human security experts when it comes to handling large attack volumes and analyzing the wide variety of threat data generated at multiple touch points. 

With around 8.4 billion connected devices currently in use across the globe, the concept of rigidly-defined network perimeters has become a thing of the past.

Traditional cyber security systems are becoming obsolete, and their prevention-focused approach cannot provide adequate defense against the complex threats of today. 

We have to keep updating technology, keep learning from setbacks and keep improving our systems, software and computing prowess to meet the myriad challenges that are confronting us. 

I understand that C R Rao Institute is working on important projects in the fields of Cryptography, Cryptanalysis and Wireless Communication with focus on Artificial Intelligence and Network Security, sponsored by Government of India.

Let me take this opportunity to remind all the budding researchers present here that the ultimate aim of technological advancement should be the betterment of the life of the common man. We should maximize the positive impact and ward off the destructive threats. 

I hope that the institute will lend leadership to India’s journey towards being self-sufficient in technology, thereby improving the lives of the masses.

I wish all the faculty, scientists and Research fellows working in C R Rao Institute the very best in their future endeavours.

Thank You!

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has visited Vekateswara Veda Vigyana Peetham run by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), at Tirumala today, and called for translating Vedas into various Indian languages in a simplified manner for the common man to understand their importance.

 

Addressing the students and the teachers of the Peetham, the Vice President described Vedas as a veritable treasure house of knowledge and said they reflect India’s age-old traditions and culture. There was a need to protect, preserve and propagate the scientific knowledge contained in the Vedas on various aspects of life and bring them within the reach of the common man, he added.

 

Shri Naidu said that Vedas were not mere religious texts but contain knowledge of various disciplines such as mathematics, astronomy, agriculture, chemistry and metallurgy.  

 

Observing that Vedas could provide solutions to the most complex problems and challenges of the modern-day world, the Vice President called for taking up research on the knowledge contained in Vedas. He expressed his anguish that this aspect was not being paid adequate attention in India, while countries like Germany were undertaking extensive research.

 

Describing the students of the Veda Peetham as modern day Rishis, he expressed confidence that they would preserve and propagate the invaluable treasure of Vedas. Claiming that Guru-Sishiya parampara was a proud heritage of Sanathana Dharma, he said that learning of Vedas exemplifies this noble tradition.

 

The Vice President said that TTD funds should be used exclusively for propagating  Sanathana Dharma and providing facilities to pilgrims, but not for any other purpose.

 

The Vedic Teachers blessed Shri Naidu by performing Vedashirvachanam, while the students rendered vedic hymns.

 

Later the Vice President, his spouse, Smt. Ushamma and other family members along with other devotees had Annaprasadam under Nithyannadana programme run by TTD. He expressed his appreciation to TTD for conducting such a massive ánnadaana’ programme on a daily basis for thousands of devotees.

 

In the evening, he witnessed a literary recital by Shri Medasani Mohan.

 

Well-known exponent of Annamacharaya Keertanas, Sri Garimella Balakrishna Prasad rendered several Annamacharya’s compositions exclusively for the Vice President and his team. Subsequently, along with several devotees, he also witnessed “Nadaneerajan Programme”-offering of devotional music and dance to Lord Venkateshwara. Observing that Telugu literary forms like Avadhaanam and devotional music were invaluable heritage, the Vice President emphasized the need to preserve and propagate them.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon scientists and researchers to address pressing issues such as climate change, global warming and extreme weather events so that the world was better prepared to tackle adverse situations.

Interacting with scientists and young researchers of the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL) near Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh today, he said that weather and climate were posing new challenges with each passing day.

Shri Naidu said: “We are experiencing global warming and its effects in the form of extreme weather, cyclonic storms, intense thunderstorms, torrential rain, and droughts. Changing weather and climate patterns also affect our agriculture and economy”.

Referring to challenges like an increase in high impact weather systems, water scarcity, drying up of rivers, growing pollution and survival threat to several animal and plant species due to climate change, he said that it was highly imperative for scientists and researchers to address these issues.

Exhorting the scientists to work on state-of-the-art observational instruments to generate high-quality data on climate models suitable for India’s tropical climate, the Vice President cautioned them to guard against erroneous results generated by data from elsewhere and called for accurate assessment and prediction. 

The Indian subcontinent has distinct climatic zones and their interaction with global climate patterns needs to be studied on a priority basis for our long term well-being, he added. 

Pointing out that India has been an active member in the climate action plan right from the formation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change through to the latest Paris Accord, Shri Naidu said that in order to make a meaningful contribution to the climate action plan, there was a need for quality scientific data from all over the country and the globe.

Complimenting ISRO and Department of Space for establishing a world-class laboratory for experimental atmospheric science and numerical, the Vice President wanted the establishment of similar atmospheric research facilities in important climatic regions which have sparse or non-existent observations in the country.

Stressing the need to promote scientific temper from a young age, Shri Naidu asked NARL to produce literature on atmospheric science in a simplified manner for the benefit of school students.

The Vice President called upon scientists to focus on accurately predicting the atmospheric behavior and in addressing various challenges from climate change to poverty alleviation.

The National Atmospheric Research Laboratory is an autonomous Research Institute funded by the Department of Space of the Government of India. NARL is engaged in fundamental and applied research in the field of Atmospheric Sciences.

Earlier, the Vice President visited the MST Radar facility, Rayleigh Doppler Lidar and the High Performance Computation Facility and Data Center at the NARL. 

The Director, NARL, Dr. A.K. Patra, the In-Charge Director, Dr. T.V.C. Sharma, several Scientists and Researchers and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

""I am extremely happy to be here today. I have learnt that this organization carries out frontline research in atmospheric and space sciences. I am sure that this visit of mine and the interaction with you all will give me a better understanding of the research being conducted here and its outcome.

I am told that this laboratory was started nearly 25 years ago as a National MST Radar Facility with high-power MST radar to uncover mysteries of the middle atmosphere. I am extremely happy that this radar was recognized as the second powerful radar in the world and also the first of its kind in the equatorial Asian region. More so, it was built completely indigenously and credit goes to the scientists and engineers involved in realizing it.

I have also learnt that the original system has been upgraded with new technology providing new capabilities and improved sensitivity. I congratulate the NARL team for establishing this new system, which will certainly take us to newer heights.

I am glad that while undertaking cutting edge research in science and technology, this institute has been facilitating scientists from various universities and national laboratories to carry out their experiments. I am told that many young researchers from universities and other national laboratories have carried out their Ph. D. thesis work using the facilities here. 

Today, I visited some of the major experimental facilities and got a fairly good idea about the ongoing work and the activities identified for the future. I have been apprised about the technological developments that have taken place and the knowledge we have gained in the broad domain of atmospheric and space sciences.

I have been informed about the wide spectrum of high power radar and lidar experiments, surface and balloon-based experiments being conducted here. I could also see the high-performance computation facility and also the Data Centre. 

I am told that the high-performance computation facility is getting upgraded to enable scientists to perform high-resolution weather modeling and climate research. 

I feel that the technologies which you have developed through years of research and developmental activities should be fully utilized for a bigger goal. I would suggest that the Indian industry should utilize this expertise and indigenously develop instruments at economical prices for our researchers in Universities, colleges, and laboratories. This will spur indigenous production and innovation.

Progress in Science and Technology can be hastened through collaborations and by learning from the experiences of other laboratories in the country as well as abroad. National and International collaborations are important for solving common problems faced by mankind.

I am glad to learn that NARL is collaborating with national and international laboratories.

I have also learnt that NARL has been providing very high-resolution wind information measured by the MST radar since its inception in 1993 for all rocket launches from Sriharikota and now you are providing weather forecast for planning the rocket launch.

As we all are aware, weather and climate are posing new challenges with each passing day. We are experiencing global warming and its effects in the form of extreme weather, cyclonic storms, intense thunderstorms, torrential rain, and droughts. Changing weather and climate patterns also affect our agriculture and economy.

Mankind is facing several challenges like the warming of the atmosphere, increase in high impact weather systems, water scarcity, drying up of rivers, growing pollution and survival threat to several animal and plant species due to climate change.

In view of the risks posed by warming earth, consequent extreme weather and drought cycles that could severely affect the lives of the people, plants and animals alike, it is highly imperative for scientists and researchers to address these issues so that we are better prepared to tackle any adverse situation. 

I am told that there are two schools of thought as regards climate change-- one believes that the climate change is due to the increasing human activities, while the other group has a contrarian view and believes that the climate change is due to the changing energy input from the Sun alone. 

I am told that that there is a broad international consensus that increase in frequency of high impact weather events like thunderstorms, cloud bursts and cyclones can be attributed to global warming and consequent climatic changes. 

In order to better understand and forecast these events, Indian scientists need to work on state of the art observational instruments and techniques for generating high quality data on essential climate variables and climate models suitable for our tropical climate.   

It is a matter of national importance that we guard against erroneous results generated by models and data from elsewhere. Therefore, I exhort scientists in India to institute methods and processes on generating long term climate quality data and numerical models for accurate assessment and prediction. 

India has been an active member in the climate action plan right from the formation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change through to the latest Paris Accord. In order to make a meaningful contribution to the climate action plan, we need quality scientific data from all over the country and the globe.

The Indian subcontinent has distinct climatic zones and their interaction with global climate patterns needs to be studied on a priority basis for our long term well-being. 

Dear sisters and brothers,

India has been a country where learning was given a central place in the society and knowledge has been handed down through the generations. In the present day world, capacity building and outreach are equally important. I am pleased that NARL has been producing the next generation of atmospheric scientists through its Ph.D. program and also training several students in science and engineering streams. I am sure that this capacity building initiative will produce more scientists who will work on path-breaking frontline research.

I have been always advocating the need to promote scientific temper from a young age and I must commend NARL in its endeavor to propagate scientific ideas to  thousands of college and school students. I would like NARL to produce literature on atmospheric science and technology in a simplified manner for the benefit of school students.

After seeing the wonderful work being done by NARL here, I feel that similar atmospheric research facilities should be established in important climatic regions which have sparse or non-existent observations in the Indian sub-continent.

We seem to be lagging behind the advanced nations in economic indicators and research indicators. While both are improving with time, we need to make greater progress. I am sure that advancements in science and technology will spur economic growth, which in turn will lead to alleviation of poverty and other challenges faced by mankind. I call upon scientists to focus on addressing various challenges from climate change to poverty alleviation.

Finally, I congratulate ISRO and Department of Space for having established and nurtured such a world-class laboratory for experimental atmospheric science and numerical modeling. I see that it is a young laboratory filled with young and enthusiastic people. I wish you all a future filled with great scientific outcomes.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has appealed to people to study, analyze and debate the Draft New Education Policy and not to come to hasty conclusions.

Observing that core issues of education were very important and deserve the attention of all stakeholders, the Vice President said that reducing the load of school bags, promoting sports, inculcating morals, scientific and rationale temperament, history and the contribution of the freedom fighters should become part of the curriculum.

Inaugurating a two-day conference on ‘Industry Academy Interaction for Improvement of Quality of Academics’ organized by the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE) in Vishakhapatnam today, Shri Naidu called for establishing a symbiotic relationship between academia and the industry to create an ecosystem for innovation to thrive and generate employment for the youth. For this to be achieved, he wanted the industry to play a more pro-active role and establish a strong organic link with the academic institutions.

Shri Naidu asked the Industry and academia to look at long-term collaborations rather than join hands for limited purposes and one-off projects to promote the culture of research in a big way in our universities and other important academic institutions.

The Vice President suggested to the corporate entities to identify specific areas of interest and fund doctoral and post-doctoral research connected to them. He also urged them to set up a special corpus or fund for financing research projects that will lead to innovations, benefit the society and economy of the country.

Pointing out that many students passing out of the portals of higher education institutions were lacking employable skills, Shri Naidu said that organizations hiring the young graduates were forced to impart further on-the-job training for periods ranging from six months to one year.

Calling for a revamp of the education system so that the graduating students were fully equipped with skills to meet the needs of the industry or agriculture or have the aptitude and skills of a risk-taking entrepreneur, the Vice President said the students must not only be employable but also possess life skills, language skills, technological skills and entrepreneurial skills to enable them to be gainfully employed or self-employed.

Pointing out that the Indian universities did not figure in the top 100 ranking global universities, the Vice President urged universities and educationists to introspect and improve the standards.

Expressing his concern over instances of atrocities against women and gender discrimination, Shri Naidu said the education system should produce socially responsible citizens and called for bringing about a change in the mindset. Programmes like ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padao’ and Swachh Bharat should become people’s movements, he added.

The Vice President also stated that NITI Aayog had  unveiled last year  ‘Strategy for New India @ 75’ giving details of the progress made so far, constraints and the way forward to meet the objectives. As stated by Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, development must become a “Jan Andolan”, he added.

The need to make farmers ágripreneurs’, giving a strong push to ‘Zero Budget Natural Farming’ techniques as part of measures to increase farmers’ incomes, complete codification of labor laws, revamping minerals exploration and licensing policy, enhancing the competitiveness of Indian business as also ensuring the citizens’ ease of living are among other important recommendations.

Observing that India was once known as ‘Vishwaguru’,  Shri Naidu said that India must once again become the global hub for knowledge and innovation.

The Director of Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy, Visakhapatnam, Prof. V.S.R.K. Prasad, the Vice-Chancellor, Andhra University, Prof G. Nageswara Rao, the Member,  Director of IIM Visakhapatnam, Prof M. Chandrasekhar, the Chairman of APPCB, Shri B.S.S Prasad, the Chairman CII Visakhapatnam, Shri K.V.V Raju, the President of AP Chambers, Shri G. Sambasiva Rao, the CMD of NRDC, Dr. H. Purushotham and the Convener of IAI, Prof Pulipati King were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am glad to inaugurate the two-day conference on ‘Industry Academy Interaction for Improvement of Quality of Academics’ organised by the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE).

This topic is not only timely but quite important because new ideas, innovations and technologies are changing the dynamics of the way we live, think and act. 

Academic environment in India has to respond to these changes. In fact, ideally, it should anticipate these changes and prepare adequately to creatively shape the future. Improvement of quality at all levels of education is, therefore, very critical.

We cannot have a system that operates at sub-optimal level. We cannot have an education system that produces a large number of unskilled and unemployed youth. Every year, lakhs of students are passing out of the portals of higher education institutions with a majority of them lacking employable skills. Most of the organizations that hire the young graduates are forced to impart further on-the-job training for periods ranging from six months to one year. There is an urgent need to revamp the education system to ensure that the students coming out of our institutions of higher learning are not only employable but also possess life skills, language skills, technological skills and entrepreneurial skills to enable them to be gainfully employed or self-employed.

The students graduating must be fully equipped to meet the needs of the industry or agriculture or have the aptitude and skills of a risk-taking entrepreneur.

No doubt, there have been continuous efforts during the past many years to promote cooperation between academia and industry. However, the desired results have not yet been achieved for a variety of reasons.

I feel that there has to be a symbiotic relationship between the academia and the industry for creating the necessary ecosystem for innovation to thrive and also generate employment opportunities for the youth. For this to be achieved, the industry has to play a more pro-active role and establish a strong organic link with the academic institutions.

Dear sisters and brothers, technology has broken all barriers and the world has shrunk into a global village. This reality has to be reflected in our education system too and there has to be a paradigm change in the manner in which our educational institutions impart learning. We need to keep pace with the global trends and ensure that our students are able to seamlessly work anywhere in the world.

Our education system needs to be revamped thoroughly. I feel that the culture of research has to be promoted in a big way in our universities and other important academic institutions. The industry should come forward and lend a helping hand to educational institutions, particularly in terms of creating the needed infrastructure and equipment for undertaking high quality research.

Industry and academia should look at long-term collaborations rather than join hands for limited purposes and one-off projects. Starting from early research to translating it into products that benefit the society and contribute to the larger economy, the industry-academia tie-up should be long-lasting and aim at creating a win-win situation for both.

Companies could also identify certain specific areas of interest and fund doctoral and post-doctoral research connected to them.

I feel that the corporate world must identify some of the research-oriented academic institutions and set up a special corpus or fund for financing research projects that will lead to innovations, benefit the society and economy of the country.

The curriculum and the courses at our universities should undergo a big change. Industry must interact with university departments and help build a set of courses that are aligned to the emerging needs of the industry.  

As we are all aware, India was once called as Vishwaguru and respected world over with Nalanda, Takshashila, Pushpagiri and other centres of learning attracting knowledge-seekers from different parts of the globe. These centres offered learning in a wide range of fields from archery to astronomy and Vedas to politics.  The time has come for India to again become the global hub for knowledge and innovation.  This is possible only if we build a culture of learning from each other and growing together in a collaborative manner.

All stakeholders need to work together to vastly improve the quality of education and research. There is also a need to promote academia-industry knowledge clusters for promoting innovation-oriented research. India should be among the leading countries in publishing quality research papers in peer-reviewed international journals, and in obtaining patents for innovations.  

Policy makers, expert bodies, educationists, educational institutes and the industrial sector must strive to impart the appropriate knowledge and skills at a high level of proficiency among the country’s youth and create synergies of action between the industry and academia.

 The educational institutes must focus on useful concepts and application-oriented, problem solving approaches.

In some countries, corporates have been reaching out to universities/academic institutions and creating collaborations. I hope to see a similar trend in India also.

I am told that to encourage innovation and build industry-academia ties, the Ministry of Human Resource and Development has augmented funding to IIT- Madras by approximately Rs 300 crore. Similarly Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) and Indian Electronics and Semiconductors Association (IESA) have agreed to work with IIT-Kharagpur to build a robust talent pipeline in the ESDM space. 

More such tie-ups are needed so that the academia and industry jointly create real-time application based research platforms to provide students with better opportunities to work on various problems relating to the society. 

Such collaborations would be beneficial to both. For instance, academic institutions will get to know the exact requirements of the industry and the trends. Accordingly, it can undertake applications-based research. The industry on the hand will be able to find new talent to hire and spend the resources in a judicious manner. 

I am sure that the collective efforts of academia and the industry will not only improve the quality of teaching-learning practice but also help in bridging the gap between academia and industry. The initiatives taken in this direction by IIPE, IIM-Visakhapatnam, AU, CII and APPCB are laudable. 

Finally before concluding, I would like to stress that this interaction should not conclude as a formal and routine event. Rather, it should lead to further discussions and provide impetus to academia-industry collaboration by coming up with concrete recommendations and action.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu underscored the need for writers and litterateurs to promote progressive and positive thinking among the people even while holding a mirror to the happenings in the society.

Speaking at an event being organized by Andhra University and Mosaic Sahitya Samsta, in Visakhapatnam today, to mark the conclusion of death centenary of eminent social reformer, Kandukuri Veeresalingam, who was popularly known as Andhra Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Shri Naidu paid glowing tributes to him.

The Vice President said that Veeresalingam was forward-looking in his outlook and was ahead of his times and he was against bigotry and superstitious beliefs. He was a strong advocate of widow remarriage, opposed dowry and caste systems as also child marriage and batted for empowering women through education, he added.

Shri Naidu said that today’s writers, authors, poets and columnists have a responsibility in promoting modern and reform-oriented thinking among the people, while preserving our culture and heritage. Merely chronicling or recounting events in a society was not enough. Writers should also point to the foibles of the society and suggest correctives, he added.

The Vice President said that although the country has made rapid strides in various fields, there were many challenges. Expressing his anguish over instances of social and gender discrimination, he called upon writers to be in the forefront in the fight against social evils and in bringing about an attitudinal change among the people. They should must work for promoting cohesion in the society and not divisiveness, he added.

Stressing the need for protecting and preserving native languages, the Vice President urged intellectuals, educationists and journalists also to strive towards promoting progressive thinking and bringing about an attitudinal change among the people to eliminate social evils.

The Vice President unveiled a portrait of Shri Kandukuri Veeresalingam painted by Shri Rayana Giridhar Goud and released a book 'Kandukuri Smritilahari' (death centenary edition) compiled by the Coordinator of Kandukuri Satavardanthi, Shri T. Sanjeeva Rao on this occasion. He also felicitated Shri T. Sanjeeva Rao on this occasion. 

The Vice Chancellor of Andhra University, Col. Prof. G. Nageswara Rao, the Director, Indian Institute of Management, Visakhapatnam, Prof. M. Chandrasekhar, Sahitya Academy Awardee, Shri L.R. Swamy, the Coordinator of Kandukuri Satavardanthi, Shri T. Sanjeeva Rao and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                          My dear countrymen Namaskar. After a rather long pause, we are resuming once again, our series of touching upon matters close to people and their hearts; in fact subjects close to every person’s heart… I am once again amidst you with our ‘Mann Ki Baat’. The rigours of Elections called for hectic preoccupation, but the one thing that was missing was the sheer joy of ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ For me, it was like experiencing a kind of void. It used to be a chat in a genial atmosphere amidst the warmth of one’s own family of 130 crore countrymen; we would listen, we would re-iterate; at times our expressions would turn into an inspiration for someone close to us. You can imagine how this period must have made one feel. Sunday, the last Sunday, at 11 o’clock, even I used to be uneasy, with a nagging feeling of a kind of emptiness… you too felt the same, didn’t you? I am sure you did. Perhaps, this was not a lifeless programme. It was full of liveliness, warmth and fondness. And that is why, for me the intervening period was very difficult to bear. I used to miss something every moment; when I express myself through ‘Mann Ki Baat,’ the one speaking is me, the words are mine, the voice is mine, but the story is yours, the ‘Purusharth’ pertaining to your pursuits and goals is yours, the ‘Parakram’, the achievement is yours. I just used my words and my voice and that is why, I was not missing the programme… I was missing you. I was undergoing a bout of emptiness. There came a moment when I felt the need to reach out to you immediately after the Elections concluded. Then I thought… No! The established Sunday sequence should be maintained. But this Sunday has made one wait endlessly! Anyway, finally the opportunity has dawned. In a family like atmosphere, these plain, simple reflections become the reason for change in life, in society. Begetting a new spirit, in a way fortifying the spirit of New India, let us wish this endeavour embarks upon its onward journey.

          Over the last few months, many messages have poured in, with people stating that they have been missing ‘Mann Ki Baat’. When I read them, when I hear them, it gives me joy. It’s a warm feeling of kinship. There are times when I feel that this is my journey from the self to the unabridged whole; my journey from ‘I’ to ‘We’. For me, this nonvocal conversation with you was a part of my feelings during my spiritual journey. Amidst hectic Election engagements, many people asked me a flurry of questions on why I had gone up to Kedarnath. You have every right; I can understand your curiosity… and I too feel that my sentiments reach you. But today, I think, if I change the course of the conversation that way, the entire complexion of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ will change. Amidst the rigours of the Election, speculations on victory or defeat, before the polling was yet to start; I undertook the journey. Most people have derived political conclusions out of that. For me, it was an opportunity to meet myself. In a way, I undertook the journey to meet my inner self. I shall not reveal other things today, but I certainly want to tell you that perhaps in that solitary cave, I got an opportunity to fill up the vacuum caused due to the long pause that ‘Mann Ki Baat’ had to go through. The rest is your inquisitiveness… I think, someday I’ll talk about that too. WHEN, I can’t say, but I’ll do it for sure. You have every right as far as I am concerned. The way people have expressed their wish to know about Kedar, I feel a similar effort on your part to lay emphasis on positive things, which I get to know through your expressions.

          The letters which steadily pour in for ‘Mann Ki Baat’, the inputs that are received are entirely different from routine Government matters. One way, a letter from you can act as a source of inspiration for me; on the other it may turn out to be a source of energy for me. There are times when some of your words act as a catalyst in sharpening my thought process. People bring to the fore challenges facing the country and society; they also come out with solutions for the same. I have seen for myself that in their letters, people go to great lengths in describing their problems; it is fascinating to see that in the same breath, they express directly or indirectly, a relevant solution or two, one suggestion or the other, or even an idea! If someone refers to sanitation and cleanliness, he or she invariably voices angst against filth & dirt, but on the same page appreciates efforts being under way to ensure cleanliness. When somebody talks about the environment, one can easily sense his or her crucial concerns on the matter; at the same time, experiments that the person has attempted or seen also come to the surface, with vivid descriptions of new ideas on the issue. This means, I can closely get a fair idea of your point, in terms of extrapolating a solution to a certain problem on a society- wide scale. ‘Mann Ki Baat’is like a mirror to the country & our society. It conveys to us that there is no dearth of inner fortitude, strength & talent within our countrymen. The need of the hour is to synergise those strengths and talents, to provide opportunities, to implement them. ‘Mann Ki Baat’ also tells us that a 130 crore countrymen wish to be, strongly and actively, a part of the nation’s progress. I receive a lot of letters and phone calls in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, but the element of complaint is negligible and I would like to tell you that in the last five years, I have not come across a single instance where somebody has asked for something for personal gain. Just imagine… a person writing to the Prime Minister of the country, but seeking nothing for one’s own self… it is a reflection on the lofty collective demeanour of crores of people in the country. When I analyse this, you can visualise how heartening it must be for me, what a source of energy it is for me. You possibly don’t know that you are the ones who make me walk, who make me run and keep me full of life and zest… this is the very bond that I used to miss. My heart is filled to the brim with joy today. When it was about to end, I had stated that we would meet once again after 3 or 4 months, people assigned a political hue to it, saying ‘Hey, Modi ji is so full of confidence, he is certain!’

          The confidence was not Modi’s. This trust was the trust of your foundation. You were the ones who transformed yourself into a pillar of trust. And that is why in the last episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, then, I effortlessly said that I would be back after a few months. Actually speaking, I have not RETURNED; you brought me back, you positioned me here and gave me the opportunity to speak once again. With this sentiment, come, let’s take ‘Mann Ki Baat’ forward.

          When Emergency was imposed on the country, resistance against it was not limited to the political arena or politicians; the movement was not curtailed to the confines of prison cells. There was an outrage in the conscience of one and all. The collective torment on the loss of democracy was evident. Day and night, when one gets to eat food on time, one doesn’t realize what hunger pangs are. Similarly, in day to day life, it is difficult to savour the joy of democratic rights, unless they are snatched away. During Emergency, every citizen of the country had started getting the feeling that something that belonged to him had been snatched away. If what was snatched had never been enjoyed by that person, ever, it had to eventually precipitate into a painful inner agony. And it was not just on account of the fact that the constitution of India has made certain provisions that enabled Democracy to blossom. Of course, in order to ensure smooth conduct of the social order, a constitution is required… laws & rules are necessary, rights and duties should be part of due discourse. But, India can proudly proclaim that for us, beyond laws & rules, Democracy is embedded in our sanskar; Democracy is our culture. Democracy is our heritage; we grew up, nurturing ourselves on the fruits of that very heritage. And that is why the lack of it can be felt deeply by our countrymen, which is what we underwent during Emergency. And precisely for that, the country sacrificed one full Election, not for her own sake, but for the sake of protecting democracy. Perhaps, nowhere else in the world had citizens voted, without bothering about other rights & requirements, just for the sake of saving democracy. And the country had witnessed one such Election in ’77. Just recently, our country celebrated a mega festival of democracy, a mammoth Election Campaign, from the rich to the poor, all were happily eager in this festival to decide the fate of their country.

          When something is in close proximity of us, we tend to underestimate its importance; we ignore even amazing facts about it. We have been blessed with a Democracy so invaluable, yet we take it for granted so easily. But, we must keep reminding ourselves that our Democracy is gloriously great, it flows in our veins, through centuries of Sadhana, dedicated practice, through the sanskar, attributes that have been passed on from generations over, through a collective largeness of the heart. In the 2019 Loksabha Election, India saw over 61 crore voters exercising their franchise… yes 61 crores. We can think of this figure as one ordinary but if I place it in a global perspective, if you exclude China, the number of people who voted in India exceeds the population of any other country in the world. The number of people who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha Election is more than the entire population of America, close to double the figure. The total number of voters in India exceeds the entire population of Europe. This stands for the sheer size & spread of our Democracy. The 2019 Lok Sabha Election in history by far, was the largest democratic Election ever held in the world. You can imagine the kind of resources and manpower that was required for such a mammoth exercise. Lakhs of teachers, officers & staff strived day & night to make it possible. In order to successfully conclude this ‘Mahayagya’, on the one hand, whereas close to three lakh paramilitary  personnel discharged their duty; on the other, 20 lakh Police personnel of various states too, persevered with due diligence. It is on account of these people that this time voting took place on a larger scale compared to the previous Election. For the voting, there were around 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh VVPAT machines… you can imagine the gargantuan task! All this was done, just to ensure that no voter was deprived of his or her voting rights. In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, just for a lone woman voter, a polling station was created. You will be amazed to know that it took a journey of two days for personnel of the Election Commission, just to reach there… this is honour to democracy at its best. The world’s highest located polling station too, is in India. At an altitude of 15,000 feet, it is located in the LahaulSpiti region of Himachal Pradesh. Besides this, there is another fact pertaining to these Elections, that swells our hearts with pride. Perhaps, this is the first time ever, that women have enthusiastically voted, as much as men did. This time the ratio of men & women who voted was almost the same. Another encouraging fact is that, today, there are a record 78 women Members of Parliament. I congratulate the Election Commission and every person connected with the electioneering process and salute the aware voters of India.

          My dear countrymen, you may often have heard me say “No bouquet, just a book”! I had urged all to choose books over flowers in welcome or felicitation ceremonies. Since then, people have been offering books at many a place. Just recently, someone gave me a book entitled ‘Premchand Ki LokapriyaKahaniyan’, popular short stories by Premchand. It was a great feeling. Of course, I couldn’t get much time, but during my travelling, I got an opportunity to read some of his short stories once again. Images of the stark social realities that Premchand has portrayed in his stories vividly start forming in one’s mind when you read them. Each & every element of his writings comes alive. His stories are expressions of human emotions through simple, lucid language… they have touched my heart. His stories embody the collective psyche’, the cumulative being of the country, of the land. While reading one of his stories ‘Nashaa’, I couldn’t help but notice the scourge of economic disparity plaguing society. I was reminded of my younger days… how debates on this subject would carry on through entire nights! The moral of this story featuring the landholder’s son Eeshwari and Beer from a poor family is that if you are not careful enough, you will never know when the bane of bad company engulfs you. The other story that touched the core of my heart was ‘Eidgah’… the sensitivity of a young lad, his unsullied love for his grandmother, such maturity at that early age! When 4-5 years old Hamid comes back to his grandma with a pair of tongs, indeed, it stirs human emotions to their supreme pinnacle. The concluding line of this story makes one very emotional since it holds a vital truth about life, “Young Hamid played the role of aged Hamid – aged Ameena had turned into child Ameena”.  

Another such poignant story is 'Poos Ki Raat'. In this story, the living depiction of the paradoxes in a poor farmer's life is seen. Halku the farmer is happy even after his crops are destroyed by frost, because now he will not be forced to sleep in his fields in the cold winter. Though these stories were written about a century ago but remain relevant all the same even today. After reading these stories, I felt myself to be empathetic.

Now that we are conversing about reading, then in some extension of media, I had read about the Akshara Library in Kerala. You will be surprised to learn that this library lies in a village nestling within the dense forests of Idukki. A Primary school teacher, P.K.Muralidharan and P.V.Chinnathampi who runs a small tea shop, have between them worked tirelessly for this library. There was a time when the books were brought here stuffed in sacks and carried on the back. Today this library is a beacon guiding tribal children on a new path.

The Vaanche Gujarat campaign carried out in Gujarat was a successful experiment. Participants hailing from every age group in lakhs, participated in this campaign to read books. I will still urge you in today's digital world and in the time of Google Guru, to take some time out from your daily routine and devote it to the book. You will really enjoy it a lot and do write about whichever book you read on the NarendraModi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat' also get to know about it.

My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about issues, which are posing a challenge not only at the present but also the future. I was reading your comments on NarendraModi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the prevailing water problem. PawanGaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, ShahabAltaf and many others have written about the challenges related with water. Water is of great importance in our culture. Rigveda'sApahSuktam says this about water:

 

 

आपो हिष्ठा मयो भुवः, स्था न ऊर्जे दधातन, महे रणाय चक्षसे,

यो वः शिवतमो रसः, तस्य भाजयतेह नः, उषतीरिव मातरः |

 

Meaning that it is water which is the life force and also, the source of energy. Please bless us like a mother and may your blessings continue on to be showered upon us.

Water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year. You will be surprised that only 8% of the water received from rains in the entire year is harvested in our country. Just and just 8%! Now the time has come to find a solution to this problem. I believe, like the other problems on hand, we can also solve this predicament by the participation of the people, Janbhagidariand their power, Janshakti we are bound to find a solution through the strength, cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore citizens.

Therefore keeping the importance of water in mind, a new Jalashakti ministry has been created in the country. This will allow faster decision-making on all subjects related to water. A few days ago I tried to do something different. I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs and Gram Pradhans across the country. That in order to save water, to collect water, to save the very drops of the rainwater, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and sit and discuss the resolution to this problem with the villagers. I am happy that they have shown exemplary enthusiasm on this front and on 22nd of this month crores of people contributed free labour, Shramdaanacross thousands of panchayats. People in village after village resolved to accumulate every single drop of rainwater.

Today, I want to narrate the story of a sarpanch in the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme. Come let’s listen to what the Sarpanch of LupungPanchayat of Katakmasandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has to say to all of us through this message:

 

DILIP KUMAR RAVIDAS

 

This is BirsaMunda's land, where cohabiting in harmony with nature is a part of the culture. The people here, once again, are ready to play their active role in water conservation. For my part I wish good luck to all the village heads and all the sarpanchs for their dynamism. There are several Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation. In a way, entire villages have grasped this opportunity as collective responsibility. And it seems that the denizens of the villages have become involved in the competition for raising a ‘water temple,’ in their respective villages. As I’ve said, a collective effort begets massive positive results. There cannot be a single formula for dealing with water crisis across the country. For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in diverse ways. But the goal remains the same, and that is to save water and adopt water conservation.

          The drainage lines are being fixed in Punjab. This effort would rid of the problem of water logging. The construction of the water-tank in Telangana'sThimmaipalli is changing the lives of the people of the village. There has been a major change through construction of small ponds in the fields at Kabirdham in Rajasthan. I was reading about the collective endeavour in Vellore of Tamilnadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river. I have also read about those women of Garhwal, who are working together on the good work of implementing rainwater harvesting. I believe that many such attempts are being made and we can turn impossible in to possible when we are together and strive with collective resolve. When people will join hands, water will be conserved. Today, through the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, I am entreating 3 requests to the fellow countrymen.

My first request is that just like cleanliness drive has been given the shape of a mass movement by the countrymen, let's also start a mass movement for water conservation. We together should all resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is God's prasad to us, water is like philosopher's stone! Earlier it was said that by the touch of philosopher's stone, iron could be transmuted in to gold. I tell you, water is philosopher's stone and its mere touch creates and regenerates life! Let us start an awareness campaign to save even a single drop of water. In this campaign not only should we focus on water related problems but propagate ways to save water as well. I specifically urge the luminaries belonging to different walks of life to lead promotion of water conservation through innovative campaigns. Whether it be from the world of films, sports, our friends in the media, people belonging to social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations or people involved in conducting devotional congregations such as Katha - Kirtan, everyone should lead this movement in their own fashion. We must wake up the society, unite the society and join the society in this endeavour. You’ll see, we will find change occurring in front of our own eyes.

My second request to the countrymen  is to share many traditional methods that have been in use over the centuries in our country for the conservation of water. I urge all of you to share these traditional methods of water conservation. If any of you gets an opportunity to go to Porbandar, the place of birth of revered Bapu, then there is a house behind the house of revered Bapu, where a 200-year old water tank still exists. It is still capable of storing water and has a mechanism to harvest rain water! As I always say that whosoever visits KirtiMandir, should also pay a visit to that Water Tank. And there must be many types of such examples of experimentation in water conservation throughout our nation!

My third request to all of you is that share the information concerning the people who are making significant contributions towards water conservation, NGOs and everyone else associated in the area of water conservation in order to create an intensive database of individuals and organizations dedicated to water preservation. Come let us join water conservation, and involve ourselves in making a list of more and more innovative methods to motivate people to conserve water. You can all share your content using the # JanShakti4JalShakti hashtag.

My dear countrymen, I must express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world for one more thing! On 21st June, once again, Yoga Day was celebrated together with fervor and enthusiasm, there were instances of three-four generations of each family coming together to participate on Yoga Day. The awareness about Holistic Health Care has enhanced the glory of yoga and Yoga day. In any corner of the world, yoga enthusiast welcomes the sun as soon it rises and then there is the complete journey ending with sunset. There must hardly be a place where a human being exists without a bond with Yoga; Yoga has assumed such an iconic form. In India, over the Himalayas, across the Indian Ocean, from the lofty heights of Siachen to the depths of a Submarine, from air-force to aircraft carriers, from air-conditioned gyms to hot desert and from villages to cities - wherever possible, yoga was not just practiced everywhere, but was also celebrated collectively.

The Presidents, Prime Ministers, celebrities and ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me on the Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective nations. On that day, the world appeared to be like one big happy family.

We all know that healthy and sensitive denizens are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures this very principle. Therefore promotion of Yoga is a great example of social service. Should we not recognize such service and bestow it with honour? In the year 2019, the announcement of Prime Minister's Awards for excellence in the promotion and development of yoga was a matter of great satisfaction for me. This award would be bestowed on those organizations around the world, whose significant and unique contributions in the promotion of yoga you cannot even imagine!

For example, take ‘Japan Yoga Niketan', which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan. Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and conducts various training courses. Italy's Ms. AntoniettaRozzi, has started “Sarv Yoga International,” and popularized Yoga throughout Europe. These are inspirational examples in themselves. If there is a topic related to yoga, then can Indians lag behind others? The Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger dedicated to yoga from past many decades was also honoured. Similarly, Swami Rajarsrhi Muni the founder of Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University was also honoured. The widespread celebration of Yoga and honouring those missionaries taking Yoga to the doorsteps of the common folk made this Yoga day special.

My dear countrymen, we’re embarking on a new journey from today armed with new emotions, new realizations, new resolve and renewed vigour. But yes! I will keep on waiting for your suggestions. The process of linking with your thoughts through ‘Mann Ki Baat’ as a medium is a very important and personal journey for myself. Let us keep on meeting and keep on talking. Let me keep on listening to your thoughts, let me keep on understanding and cherish them. Let me sometimes try to live those very emotions. May your blessings remain there for me! You are my inspiration and you are my energy! Let's sit together and while enjoying ‘Mann Ki Baat’ try to fulfill the responsibilities of life. Once again next month we will meet again for another episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I Thank all of you once again.

Namaskar

	We, the Heads of State and Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa, met on 28 June 2019 on the margins of the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan. We congratulated the G20 Japanese Presidency and expressed our gratitude for the hospitality provided.
	We note the priorities chosen by Japan for its presidency, includingtrade, science, technology and innovation, infrastructure,climate change, universal health coverage, aging populations and sustainable development.
	The world economic growth appears to be stabilising and is generally projected to pick up moderately later this year and into 2020.However, the strengthening of growth remains highly uncertain, withrising tradeandgeopolitical tensions,commodity price volatility, inequality and insufficient inclusive growth,and tighter financial conditions adding to the risk.Global imbalances remain large and persistent and require thorough monitoring and timely policy responses.We further stress the importance of a favourable global economic environment for sustained growth of international trade.
	In this scenario, we note with satisfaction that the BRICS countries have been the main drivers of global growth over the last decade, and currently represent close to a third of global output. Projections indicate that the BRICS will continue to account for more than half of global economic growth through 2030. Continued implementation of structural reforms will enhance our growth potential.Balanced trade expansion among BRICS members will further contribute to strengthening international trade flows.
	In helping to address challenges and to fully benefit from opportunities, we acknowledge the importance of, among others: open markets; stronger economic resilience; financial stability; well-designed and coordinated macroeconomic policies, as appropriate; structural reforms; adequate investment in human capital; reduction in poverty levels and inequality; effective competition to promote investment and innovation; open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environments;cooperation in public-private partnerships (PPP); and infrastructure financing and development. International and domestic measures in these areas and others will contribute to sustainable and inclusive economic growth.We call for greater participation of developing countries in the global value chains. We recognise the importance of the interface between trade and the digital economy. We also affirm the role of data for development.
	We are committed to transparent, non-discriminatory, open, free and inclusive international trade. Protectionism and unilateralism run counter to the spirit and rules of the WTO. We reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and international law, and our full support to the rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its center. We will work constructively with all WTO Members on the necessary reform of the Organization, with a view to better addressing current and future challenges in international trade, thus enhancing its relevance and effectiveness. The reform must, inter alia, preserve the centrality,core values and fundamental principles of the WTO,and consider the interests of all members, including developing countries and LDCs. It is imperative that the WTO negotiation agenda be balanced and be discussed in an open, transparent and inclusive manner.
	The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is an indispensable pillar of the multilateral trading system and the Appellate Body is essential for the proper and effective functioning of the Organisation. We remain committed to the preservation of a functioning two-stage binding adjudication system for disputes in the WTO. Recalling the urgency of solving the impasse in the appointment of members of the WTO Appellate Body, we urge that the Appellate Body selection process be initiated immediately.
	We reaffirm our commitment to a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the center of the Global Financial Safety Net. We reiterate our commitment to work with the Executive Board towards the implementation of the IMF quota and governance reform on the basis of the principles agreed in 2010. We remain committed to concluding the 15th General Review of Quotas no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings.
	We note with appreciation the role of the New Development Bank (NDB) in infrastructure financing and sustainable development and stress the need for enhanced and continued efforts to build a strong, balanced and high-quality portfolio of projects. We emphasize the importance of a focused effort to address the backlog in critical infrastructure investments in member countries.TheNDB will be strengthened bythe establishment of regional offices. We welcome theNDB’s commitment to mobilise resources in the domestic currencies of all its members, startingin China, as well as the upcoming bond programmes in South Africa and Russia. We look forward to the early implementation of the NDB Project Preparation Fund and expect it to become an efficient instrument for the preparation of projects, providing technical assistance to the NDB member countries.
	We stress the continued importance of the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) as a mechanism to forestall short-term balance of payment pressures in member countries.Following the successful test run conducted in 2018, we commit to further more complextest runs to ensure its operational readiness to respond to a call on resources, if needed.We welcome the functioning of the CRA System of Exchange in Macroeconomic Information (SEMI). We welcome continued efforts to establish the BRICS Local Currency Bond Fund and look forward to starting its operation.We also support cooperation between the CRA and the IMF.
	We strongly condemn terrorist attacks, including against BRICS countries, in all forms and manifestations, wherever and by whom so ever committed. We urge concerted efforts and a comprehensive approach to counter terrorism under the UN auspices on a firm international legal basis. We reiterate that it is the responsibility of all states to prevent financing of terrorist networks and of terrorist actions from their territories.We reiterate our commitment to fight the exploitation of internet for terrorist purposes.While recognising that states have the leading role to ensure safety and security in the use of ICTs, wecall on the technology companies to cooperate with governments, in accordance with applicable law, to eliminate the ability of terrorists to use digital platforms to encourage, recruit, facilitate or commit terrorist acts.
	We remain firmly committed to fighting corruption and will continue to foster integrity in the public and private sectors. We will, therefore, strive to promote international anticorruption cooperation and strengthening of legal frameworks, as appropriate,to more effectively address cases of corruption especially with regard to assets recovery. We will seek to enhance our mutual efforts in the prosecution of persons sought for corruption. We recognise the role of whistle-blowers[1]in preventing and combating corruption in both the public and private sectors and the needto improve measures to protect whistle-blowers.
	We acknowledge that corruption, including illicit money and financial flows, and ill-gotten wealth stashed in foreign jurisdictions, is a global challenge which may impact negatively on economic growth and sustainable development. We will strive to coordinate our approach and encourage a stronger global commitment in this regard. We also recognise the need to strengthen cooperation, subject to domestic legal systems, in anti-corruption law enforcement, extradition of fugitives, economic and corruption offenders, and in recovering stolen assets. We reaffirm our commitment to support international cooperation in combating illicit financial flows, including cooperation within the Financial Actions Task Force (FATF), the World Customs Organisation and other relevant multilateral mechanisms.
	We recognise the crucial role of cooperation in transitioning towards cleaner, more flexible energy efficient systems that combine growth with decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, while ensuring energy security, access to energy, sustainability and affordability. We acknowledge the importance of varied sources of energy and technological advances to achieve a low emission future, such as solar energy, sustainable bioenergy and natural gas in transportation. In this regard, we acknowledge efforts by BRICS countriesin promoting international cooperation on renewable energy resources and reiterate our commitment to strengthen the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform, aiming at facilitating joint studies on sustainable energy and sharing advanced energy technologies.
	We remain committed to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement, adopted under the principles of the UNFCCC, including the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. We urge developed countries to provide financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries to enhance their capability in mitigation and adaptation. We look forward to the UN Climate Action Summit to be held in September this year to produce positive outcomes.
	Recalling the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we reaffirm our strong commitment to sustainable development. We stress the importance of fully honoring official development assistance commitments and the provision of development resources, in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.We continue to support the G20 Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda, the G20 Initiative on Supporting Industrialisation in Africa and Least Developed Countries and the G20 Africa Partnership, including the Compact with Africa.
	We commend Brazil for identifying Economic Growth for an Innovative Future as the theme of the 2019 Chairship. Recognising that innovation is a key driving force behind development, we reaffirm our commitment to maximise the benefits of digitalisation and emerging technologies, including for the population of rural and remote areas. We encourage joint efforts to share good practices on internet-driven poverty alleviation and digital transformation of the industrial sector. We stress the importance of continuing BRICS scientific, technical, innovation and entrepreneurship cooperation, including the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution (PartNIR), iBRICS Network, the BRICS Institute of Future Networks, and Young Scientists Forum.
	We express our support to the Brazilian BRICS Chairshipin 2019 and look forward to a successful 11th BRICS Summit in Brasilia, in November.

                YourExcellencies and my friends President Xi and President Putin,


We three countries had a summit level meeting last year in Argentina.
After the useful exchange of views on the major issues of the world, we agreed to meet again in the future.
I am very happy to welcome you to this RIC Informal Summit today.

 




As the world's leading economies, exchange of views between us, on the economic, political and security situation of the world is important. Our trilateral meeting today is a useful medium for discussing and coordinating on major global issues.

We had exchange of views on many issues in the meeting of our Foreign Ministers in China in February this year. It included promotion of counter-terrorism, international hot-spot issues, reformed multilateralism, climate change and cooperation under RIC.


Now I request His Excellency, President Xi to make his opening remarks.
(After the opening remarks by President Xi)


Thank you President Xi.


Now I request His Excellency, President Putin for his opening remarks.


Thank you President Putin.

                YourExcellencies, 


First of all, I congratulate President Bolsonaro for being elected the President of Brazil. And I also welcome him in the BRICS family. I also give my heartfelt thanks to President Bolsonaro for organizing this meeting. On this occasion I congratulate our friend Ramaphosa for again being elected as the President of South Africa. 



Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi addressing the BRICS Meeting, on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit, in Osaka, Japan.

Excellencies, 

With this kind of informal discussion we get an opportunity to co-ordinate with each other on the main topics of G-20. Today I will focus on three major challenges. First, the recession and uncertainty in the world economy. One-sided decision and rivalry are dominating over rules based multilateral international trade systems. On the other hand, the lack of resources is reflected in the fact that there is an estimated deficit of $ 1.3 trillion for investing in infrastructure development of emerging market economies.


The second major challenge is to make development and progress inclusive and sustainable. Rapidly changing technologies such as digitization and climate change are not just challenges for us, but for the future generations also. Development is truly development in the right direction when it reduces inequality and contributes to the empowerment. Terror is the biggest threat to all of the humanity. It not only takes the lives of innocent people, but it has a huge adverse effect on the economic progress and social stability. We have to stop all the means of support and help available to terrorism and racism.


Excellencies, 

Although resolution of these problems is not easy, yet I would like to make 5 key recommendations in the limited time:


i)-The synergy between BRICS countries can lead, to some extent, to the resolution of the side effects of unilateral decisions. We have to keep on emphasizing for reformed multilaterism in international financial and business institutions and organizations for the necessary reforms.

ii)-For sustained economic growth the required resources such as oil and gas are needed to be constantly available at low prices.


iii)-Physical and social infrastructure and renewable energy programs of the member countries should get more priority by the New Development Bank. India's initiative for Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure will help in the development of appropriate infrastructure to face natural calamities by the least developed and developing countries. I exhort all of you to join this coalition.

iv)-Movement of skilled workers around the world should be easy. This will also benefit the countries where a large part of the population has crossed the working age.


v)-I have recently called for a Global Conference on Terrorism. Lack of necessary consent to fight against terrorism cannot keep us deedless. I appreciate Brazil to give a place in the main priorities to the fight against terrorism.

 



Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi with the leaders of BRICS nations, in Osaka, Japan.

 

 

Excellencies, 

I'm eagerly waiting for the BRICS Summit in Brasília. India will fully cooperate to make this Summit successful.


Thank you all so very much.

                Friends of India the people of Japan and my Indian friends who have gathered here in such large numbers! My greetings to you all!

I was wondering why I was being taken to Kobe. I have been here a number of times; there are so many faces. I asked -'why are you taking me there? Who will come?' But I am indeed surprised to see your increased enthusiasm! I am really grateful to you for your love. 

I am fortunate to have got the opportunity of coming to Japan once again after seven months. Even the last time I had got the opportunity to interact with the Indians settled here as well as the Japanese friends. It is indeed a coincidence that when I had come here last year, the election results of my dear friend Shinzo Abe was out and all of you had reposed your faith in him again. And today when I am with you, the world's largest democracy, India, has expressed greater love and faith than ever before on their Prime Servant. 

I know that many of you have contributed to this mandate. Some of you had come to India and had directly worked for it, had put great efforts in the scorching heat of 40-45 degree Celsius. Some people had also provided all possible information through social media, Twitter, Facebook, Narendra Modi app etc. Some other had written letters to their old friends and had emailed to their villages. In a way, you had strengthened the festival of democracy and had made it livelier. I express my gratitude to you all for the same. 

 

Friends,

 

The 130 crore Indians have made an even stronger government and it is an important event in itself. For the first time in three decades, a government with absolute majority was formed for the second time in succession. Such an accomplishment in a vast country like India is not a small thing. Although in 1984 one party had formed government in succession; but you know the conditions of that period. You are also aware of the reasons for the same. You are also aware of the reasons why the people had gone to vote. I need not repeat. But it is true that after 1971, the country had given the government a pro-incumbency mandate for the first time.

 

Friends,

 

Are you happy with the sweeping mandate of India or not? Whose victory is it? When I get to hear it from you, it gives me immense pleasure. This is the victory of truth. It is the victory of Indian democracy. You can understand the intent of India even from Japan. There is no difference between your and their aspirations. Hence, we get to hear your reply. It gives immense satisfaction that we are moving in the right direction. 

When we watch a cricket match in the stadium, we come to know later the reason for how a player got 'out'. But those watching the match live on T.V sitting at home and are far away from the field,  get to know immediately the reason for 'out' which could be because of problem with wavelength. Similarly, you are watching India from a distance. You have a greater capability of getting hold of the truth. Therefore your reply - 'victory for truth, victory for democracy and victory for the Indians', holds immense importance to me. It inspires me and gives me a new strength. I am grateful to you all for the same.

One of the reasons behind this victory is faith in the hopes and aspirations of the people keeping devoted to the democratic values.  61 crore voters had come out in scorching heat of 40 - 45 degree Celsius and had gone to the polling booth far away from  their houses to cast their votes. The number of voters is higher than the population of any country except China. India's democracy is enormous with 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 600 political parties actively participated in the elections with more than 8000 candidates. It was such a big festival of democracy! There was no greater democratic election in the history of humanity and every Indian should be proud of this.

Breaking this record or creating a better record in the future too will be in the hands of India. In a way, India has the copyright. As Indians we all as well as India's well-wishers are proud of it. This will inspire the entire world. It has proved yet again that the loyalty of the common masses of India towards democracy is unwavering. Our democratic institutions and democratic system are pioneering in the world.

 

Friends, 

 

This strength of India will give new hope to the 21st century world. This election and its impact are not limited to India only; this is a motivating event for the democratic minds of the world. This mandate has been given to meet the expectations and aspirations of New India. And this mandate will also give new lease of life to our relationship with the world. Automatically the world will have faith in India. Whenever they will talk to India, they will think -- Yes, this government has the mandate of the people; the people have elected the government with absolute majority. Thus, whatever will be decided, they will carry that forward. 

A government with absolute majority is essential in international relations. However, a greater public mandate in that absolute majority not only strengthens the government further but also enhances the confidence and faith.

The people have added the nectar of 'Sabka Vishwas' to 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. We are moving ahead with this mantra. It will also strengthen the world's faith in India and will reassure the world. I can feel the same.

Japan has a significant place in India's relationship with the world. These relationships are age-old. The essence of this relationship is a sense of belonging, goodwill, respect for each other's culture and civilization. These relationships also have a link to Mahatma Gandhi. Coincidentally, this year marks the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. We have been learning and hearing one lesson taught by Gandhi ji since our childhood - 'Bura Mat Dekho, Bura Mat Suno, Bura Mat Kaho' i.e. see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil"". Every child of India knows this concept very well. However, very few people are aware of the fact that the three monkeys chosen by Bapu for sending out this message were created by Japan in the 17th century. Mizaru, Kikazaru, and Iwazaru are Japan's heritage, whom Pujya Bapu chose as a symbol for a great social message and propagated it.

This association of our conduct, behaviour and rituals is also preceded by the arrival of Buddhism in Japan. The next Gion festival is scheduled to be held in Kyoto next month. And the chariot used in this Gion festival is decorated with Indian silk yarn. And this tradition is not new; it has been there since time immemorial.

Similarly, four of the Seven Gods of Fortune – shichifukujin , are directly related to India. Mother Saraswati is recognized in Japan as Benzaiten, Kichijoten as Mother Lakshmi, Bishamon as Lord Kuber, and Daikokuten as Mahakal.

 

Friends,

 

The Shibori art of fabric printing is an age-old bridge between India and Japan relations. Within the Bandhani art of Gujarat's Kutch and Jamnagar, the artisans have been using the resist technique for ages. That is, the people working in Japan will feel that they are in Japan if they watch the artisans of Kutch and Jamnagar and the people of Kutch and Jamnagar will feel they are in Gujarat if they see the workers of Japan. There is a lot of similarity. Moreover, there is also a little similarity in our languages. 'Dhyan' or meditation in India is known as Zen in Japan. 'Seva' or service in India is known as 'Seva' in Japanese too. सेवा परमो धर्म:, that is,  self-less service is considered as the prime duty in India. And the Japanese society has exhibited the same in practice.

 

Friends,

Many Indians including Swami Vivekananda, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Justice Radha Vinod Pal, have strengthened our relationship with Japan. There has also been love and respect for India and Indians in Japan.

Consequently, the relationship between India and Japan started strengthening after the end of the Second World War. About two decades back, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori ji together had given a form of global partnership to our relationship.

In 2014, after I became the Prime Minister, I got the opportunity to strengthen this friendship with my friend Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. We took our diplomatic relations away from the formalities of capitals and diplomats and brought them directly to the people. Besides Tokyo, I have also travelled to Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe and Yamanashi along with Prime Minister Abe. And I have visited Kobe multiple times. I get confused with the number of visits to Kobe - four, five or three times. I used to come here even when I was not the PM. Last year, Prime Minister had welcomed me to his home in Yamanashi. His special gesture was heart touching for every Indian. Otherwise, such a personal touch in diplomatic relations is rare.

I was fortunate to take my friend Prime Minister Abe to Ahmedabad and Varanasi besides Delhi. Prime Minister Abe also joined the Ganga Aarti in my parliamentary constituency and one of the world's oldest cultural and spiritual cities - Kashi. He not only was a part of it but always ensured that he mentioned about his spiritual experience during all his speeches. He still mentions it. These pictures are also etched in the minds of every Indian

Japan has played an important role in India's development journey over the last six decades. This role is going to be stronger in 21st Century New India. In 1958, Japan had approved its first Yen loan to India. Since then, Japanese companies have been working in India and they have created a separate identity of being the best quality. 

There was a time when we were collaborating for manufacturing cars. Today we are collaborating for manufacturing bullet trains. There are Japanese projects and investments from East to West and North to South in the country. Similarly, India's manpower and talent are contributing to strengthen Japan's economy.

 

Friends,

 

Our cooperation in building a New India will be more widespread. We are moving forward with the goal of making India a 5 trillion dollars economy in the coming five years. Social sector is our priority. Besides this, we are emphasizing upon huge investment in infrastructure. 

The digital infrastructure, in particular, puts India in the forefront as an attractive destination to invest by the whole world. Digital literacy in India is growing very fast today. Digital transactions are at record level. A huge infrastructure is being prepared for innovation and incubation; a new environment is being created. With this, we have the goal of turning India into an eco system of 50 thousand startups in the coming five years.

 

 

Friends,

 

There was a time when the saying - 'sky is the limit' was true. But India is exploring the space after crossing that limit. It is our goal to get affordable and effective space technology to make the lives of 130 crore people of India easier and safer. I am happy that we are moving ahead with success in this regard.

Recently, India was able to manage the various challenges associated with the Fani cyclone with minimum damage. The world has appreciated the effort made with the use of government machinery, human resources and space technology together. India did it! On one hand, the nation was busy with the elections, while on the other hand this task was completed in an amazing way! The world appreciated the work. It is an encouraging factor for us. This is the reason why in a few months we are going to launch Chandrayaan-2, carrying our Moon Mission forward. We are ready to send our first man mission, Gaganyaan by 2022. And we are working with the dream of sending an Indian who will unfurl the tricolour there.

We are looking for possibilities to ensure that there is our station in space. All the work that is being done today is for the people of India brimming with aspirations. This new middle class is full of aspirations and hopes. It is waiting for quick results. We are developing newer ways of development for them.

 

Friends,

 

At a time when the whole world is viewing India as the gateway of several possibilities, then our synergy with Japan is also going to set a new height. I believe that Japan's Kaizen Philosophy also applies to the progress of Indo-Japan relations. When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I used to get my CM staff trained in Kaizen continuously because the Kaizen process is a process which never stops. Our relationships will continue to grow even stronger.

 

Friends,

 

As the Prime Minister, it is my fourth visit to Japan. In each of these visits, I felt an affinity towards India in Japan. I have had a direct experience in Japan of various aspects like taking pride in one's civilization and values, making talent and technology a part of one's traditions and nation building. I am not the only person to have experienced this.

A century ago, even Swami Vivekananda ji was pretty much influenced by the civilization, dedication of the people and work ethics when he had visited Japan. Then Swami Vivekananda ji had even said that every Indian should travel to Japan, but at that time the population was less. Now this will not be possible as there are 130 crore people of the country ... Anyway! I too understand that; but you all, the representatives of the 130 crore people are present here. You all continue to take the work culture, work ethics, talent, tradition and technology of Japan to India and tell the people here about the same things in India. This bridge gives us new strength; always helps to change into a new system and makes relations lively. These are not rituals but a vibrant system. And a vibrant system is formed by association of the people.

 

Finally,  before I end my speech, I wish you all, the people of Japan, the Indians and Japanese brothers and sisters the very best for the new Reiwa era. I wish for a beautiful harmony in everyone's lives during this era. I express my heartfelt gratitude to you for your heartiest welcome and hospitality towards me whenever I am in Japan, especially in Kobe. 

Perhaps you are aware of the fact that International Yoga Day was on June 21 and the Indian Government honours and rewards the organizations and individuals working for promoting and spreading Yoga in India and abroad. You might be aware of the fact that this time the Government of India has decided to honour the organization working for yoga in Japan. That's a matter of great pride. That is, we are connected in every way.

With this pride, once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to you for giving me the opportunity to be with you all and to seek your blessings.

Thank you!

Hon'ble Chairperson,

After the new public mandate, today for the first time I have got the opportunity to put forth my views before the Hon'ble Members of the Rajya Sabha. We have been given the opportunity by the people of the country with greater faith to serve the nation once again. I am grateful to all. However, at the very beginning of this second term, Madan Lal Ji, an honorable member of this House, is not among us. I pay my tribute to him.

Several Hon'ble Members have placed their thoughts before the House in their own way. All kinds of emotions have been expressed here. There was sourness, bitterness, sarcasm, anger, constructive advice as well as appreciation from the people.

In every session of the Rajya Sabha, Arun ji's eloquence ... Everyone is very much interested in listening to him. But these days, he is recovering his health I am sure,  it will be our fortune that after becoming healthy he will return soon in the house.   As a leader, Mr. Thawar Chand Ji will guide us all in this august house. I also welcome him. In the discussion that is going on in the last two days, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad Ji, Mr. Digvijay Singh Ji, our friend Mr. D Raja, Mr. Derek O'Brien Ji, Mr. Ramgopal Yadav, Mr. Majid Memon Ji, Mr. Ramdas Athawale, Mr. T.K. Rangarajan, Mr. J.P. Nadda ji, Swapnn Dasgupta ji and nearly 50 other honorable members have made this discussion enriched with.

Everyone has expressed his view in his own way- There was some type of sourness, there was sharpness, there were also some satires, there was some resentment, there were creative suggestions, and there was also some public greeting. Every kind of spirit has appeared here. And some people were also those who did not get the opportunity to go to the ground, and then the anger that was supposed to get out here probably could be found here, so also saw this.

This election was really special. After several decades, once again a government with absolute majority was formed for the second time in succession. It indicates the significance of political stability. This didn't happen only in this election. During all the elections over the past few months, it has been observed that whichever party came into power, the voters had emphasized upon political stability. It is a sign of a strong democracy.

While working for the organization, I have seen and carried out several election campaigns. After getting into politics, I had got the opportunity to fight as well as help others fight elections but there are very few occasions wherein the public fights elections on its own. The 2019 elections were in a way fought by the people instead of parties. The people themselves were taking the information on good work of the government to other people. Those who were not benefited too believed that if the other person was benefited, they too would. This faith plays a significant role in this election. I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to meet and seek blessings of the public from every corner of the country.

 

Hon'ble Chairperson,

Election itself is extremely crucial for a democratic world. It has a global value. I believe that saying with reference to the huge public mandate - you have won the elections but the country has lost the elections, due to a limited thinking and distortion of thoughts, is a grave insult to the people of India. 

This is not an ordinary statement but these things force the people to contemplate seriously. When such statements like ' the democracy has lost and the nation has lost' are given, I would like to ask - did India lose in Wayanad? Did it lose in Raebareilly? Did it lose in Behrampur, Thiruvananthapuram and Amethi? What kind of an argument is it that India lost because Congress lost? Is the nation equivalent to Congress? There is a limit to arrogance. There shouldn't be any arrogance. There is no question of limit. I wish to know that a party governing the nation for 55-60 years could not win a single seat in 17 states. Can we simply say that the nation lost?

I believe that by using such a language we are questioning the conscience of the voters. I can understand our criticism and it is acceptable in a democracy but insulting the voters of the country like this is extremely painful. 

We have seen that in 40-45 degree Celsius temperature, people had stood in long queues to cast their votes. 80-90 year old voters had come with their sticks to vote. There were several election officials who despite their recent mother's death had come for their duty. An election concludes after the hard work of innumerable people and we insult the voters of our country in this manner.

We have stooped so low in this politics of insults that we were told that we had insulted the farmers of our country. They even said that the farmers were bribed. They said that the vots of the farmers were purchased with a scheme of Rs.2000. I believe that the farmers of the country should not be insulted like this. The farmers of the country cannot be bribed. Our farmers are the ones who with tremendous labor and hard work produce food grains. He never thinks that the food produced by him will be fed to whom - the poor or the rich? Using such language for these farmers is insulting the 15 crore farmers.

I am astonished that even the media was abused. Where are we? Are elections won due to the media? Can media be bribed? In that case, the same should also apply to Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Things said in the House have importance. Whatever we say might grab headlines in the newspapers but we should also keep in mind the dignity of the Indian democracy. The election process is an opportunity of enhancing India's glory which we should not let go.

You can imagine the enormity of these elections. 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, 650 political parties and more than 8000 candidates! If we place these facts before the world, the world will be surprised! A crucial aspect has surfaced in this election. Our sisters and daughters have done a commendable job in this election! Usually the voting percentage of males used to be higher than the females. For the first time this gap has become almost zero. This in itself has become an essence of the Indian democracy. It is a matter of great joy that almost 78 women Parliamentarian have been elected this time.

Not only this, the people of Bharatiya Janata Party and NDA have come to victory in this election… It is the specialty of this election that be it the North, South, East or West, in all corners with BJP and NDA winning the majority. It is not that we are only in a corner ... all away, we have got the approval.

Those who have lost their dreams, whose dreams have been shattered, whose ego has been hurt. They may not be able to greet the voters of the country, However,  I bow my head and congratulate all the voters and thank them. I also congratulate all the officers, security personnel associated with the election process and the Election Commission.

 

Hon'ble Chairman,

A lot of discussion is going on here regarding the EVMs. A new trend has started now. EVMs are being questioned. There was a time when our party had only two members in the House. We were mocked at. We had gone through hard times but we had faith in our party workers. We had faith in the intentions. We had faith in the people of the country. We had been preparing with a lot of hard work and sacrifice. From that frustrating situation we once again built our party with a new belief. The generation ahead of us worked but showed it and that is the test of leadership.

It happened at the Polling Booth Camp, at that time, it was so-so, it was soaked ... so we lost, there was not so much crying ... we lost, will work again. We left again to work. And we have come here with the results. We didn't cry over polling booths. People look for excuses when there is a lack of self-confidence. EVMs are blamed so as to console and reassure before their colleagues that they can say that we lost due to the EVMs.

I believe that we cannot help the political cadre in this way and instead upset the cadre. It cannot be useful. If you have the courage, then come forward. Prepare the cadre and then fight in the upcoming elections.

 

Hon'ble Chairman,

There have been ceaseless modifications in the election process. After the 1952 period, elections used to go on for months. The election officials used to go to every village with the ballot boxes. Modifying that process, we have reached here today. It is a continuous process. Earlier, after the elections, the newspapers used to carry headlines like - number of people killed; amount of violence; and the number of booth captured. Today due to the EVMs, there is the only news about the percentage increase in voting. This is an important aspect. Earlier booth capturing and looting were normal. Only the miscreants had the power in their hands. After the election process has turned more democratic, people have started losing. That is why they want to go back to the era of ballot boxes. The country cannot help in the process of capturing democracy in this way.

Hon'ble Chairman, Today from the House, I want to tell the nation that for the first time in 1977, the discussion on EVMs had started. At that time we were nowhere in politics. It was first used in 1982. We were not there even in 1988. The dignitaries at that time from this very House had approved it lawfully. They had framed the law. Moreover, under the leadership of the Congress in 1992, all the rules related to the EVMs were made. Like they keep saying - we did this, we did that; this too was done by you. Now you have lost. That's why you are crying.

Till date, about 113 assembly elections have been conducted in the country. And almost all the parties present here today have got the opportunity to come to power or share the power with the same EVMs. There have been four General Elections for Lok Sabha. Even in those elections parties had changed and different people had come to power. But after losing today they are blaming the same EVMs. After 2001, several cases related to the EVMs were fought in the various High Courts and the Supreme Court. After all the examination, the Judiciary of all the nations has given positive verdict regarding the EVMs.

In 2017, there was a huge uproar regarding the EVMs. Then, the Election Commission stepped forward and challenged the protesters to come forward and prove the EVMs wrong. Not a single party of those who are crying over the EVMs went to the Election Commission. NCP and CPI went to the Election Commission but they didn't question the EVMs. They just tried to know how the EVM operated. At least NCP and CPI went to the Election Commission. Others who doubted didn't go to the Election Commission even after its invitation.

When a few groups with vested interest started with the uproar regarding the EVMs, some of our people also started believing that there was an issue with the EVMs. Even people from our party started questioning but we honestly tried to seek the truth. We also tried to understand the technology and started walking on the right path.

 

 

Hon'ble Chairman,

Then the VVPAT system started. A few people went to the Supreme Court time and again and tried to derail the election process. Every evening they used to go to the Election Commission and create uproar and got the media a few headlines. It was an attempt to create disbelief in the minds of the voters. What happened to the VVPAT? After all the speculation, VVPAT once again enhanced the power of EVMs. Results are here.

I am surprised at Congress party, so I have to say that you have ruled for so many years. You have been the main political stream of the country for a long time… Today from experience I have to say that you have some problem that you cannot even accept the victory. You have won so many elections after years of independence. And since 2014, I am constantly watching that you cannot even accept defeat. I do not believe that this is a healthy growth. In a democracy, every party should have its own position, significance and respect. But neither are we accepting our defeat nor able to accept the victory. Since 1952, there has been a constant reform of the election process and it should continue with similar reforms in the future too.

And I believe that it should also be discussed continuously and it should be discussed with an open mind, there is no need to be with a tied mind. But to say out right that we are not in favor of one country, one election, oh brother, let us first have discussions. I have personally met several MPs and all of them have said that we must get rid of this disease. There should be elections once in five years. The festival of elections could go on for two months and everyone should be engaged with business as usual. Everyone said the same thing. It might be difficult to take a stand publicly. Isn’t it the need of the hour that at least there should be just one voters list in the country? Unfortunately today there are as many voters list as the number of elections. So much money and hard work of the people of the country is going into it.

The State and the Centre together must frame such laws so that there is only one voters list for every election that will be created at the Panchayat level so that no voter is left out because there is a value of every vote. One can lose or win with just 30-40 votes. Similarly, the polling stations of the voters should also be determined so that he/she doesn't have to look for it on the day of the elections. Therefore, reforms in the election process are mandatory. Reforms should continue.

Earlier there used to be One Nation One Election concept in our country and you all have got the benefit of the same. Some people give arguments which have no logic. They say how the voters will decide together. Odisha is the greatest example. There is more rural areas in Orissa. Odisha is not so much developed. It is among the states of India, which still have to work hard to bring them in the way of development. The voters there did cast two votes - one for Lok Sabha and the other for Legislative Assemble. That means our voters can cast two votes at the same time. They have that conscience. There are some regions where all the assembly seats went to the BJD and they gave Lok Sabha seats to the BJP. Our voters have that maturity. We are disrespecting them.

Rumors are being spread that if simultaneous elections take place then regional parties would be finished. Wherever simultaneous elections have happened, in all those regions regional parties have come to power. You can check the history. Regional party came to power in Andhra Pradesh and also in Odisha. Don't doubt the intelligence of the country's voters. Every effort should be welcomed. We should play our role in every effort. But if we shut the doors in the beginning, then how will we bring change? In my opinion we should not doubt the conscience of the voters.

Sometimes I wonder that do they oppose only the EVMs. No? I feel we have taken the term 'opposition party' in letter and spirit. Opposition party is to oppose. I remember that I was sitting in this house and scholars were making such speeches, big-minded themselves, as when God came to disperse the intelligence, they were standing in the first queue. Such people are sitting here. These few scholarly members in this House had said that digital transaction was not possible in the country. How will the poor become digital? How will he hold mobile phone? There were several such speeches. I wonder to hear them. We opposed that.

Some members opposed the Aadhaar. When you were in power, the Aadhaar was great. When we are trying to reduce corruption with Aadhaar, it became a crisis. They went to the Supreme Court and tried to stop Aadhaar. If we want to become a modern India, a New India, can we stay away from technology? Safeguarding is a requirement of Technology but can we keep on running away from these things?

GST, EVM, digital V-map, everything was opposed. Negativity in everything! All the parties that created hurdles for the government in Rajya Sabha during the past five years, the voters have punished them. Today the voters are observing all the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha and while voting they keep the behavior of the parties in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in their minds. It has been observed in this election. This is a lesson to be learnt for the coming five years. It is for everyone that we have to answer where and where we stop the task of the elected government in the Rajya Sabha.

I am astonished that New India is being opposed. What is the reason? You tell us that five of your points are correct and the rest are incorrect. Someone might say that the concept of New India is to develop India but America didn't do it or some other country didn't do it. So we shouldn't do it. Leave what others are doing. The history of our country is 5000 years old. We are the people with great traditions and values. Leave what others are doing. We have to set an example in the world.

Why shouldn't the 125 crores people dream big? We can say that 10 points are not right but at least five points are correct. Let us make an effort towards those five. Let us not commit the sin of pushing the people of our country towards hopelessness. Let us make changes in it. But should we out-rightly say that we want old India? Do we want that old India where the cabinet decision is torn in a press conference? Do we want that old India where the Indian Navy is used for tours? Do we want that old India where the Country becomes tired of news of scams in Navy, Army and Air force or the one that supports the tukde-tukde gang? Do we need that India?

Do we want that old India wherein we had to stand in long queues for hours for rail reservation or the India wherein reservation was not possible without middlemen? Do we want that old India wherein we had to stand in queues outside the homes of MPs for gas connection or waiting for months for Passport? Do we want that old India with inspector Raj or that India wherein interviews are held for the posts of peons, drivers, watchman and carrying our corruption in the name of interview?

I am astonished, the people of the country are not at all willing to go back to old days. They are waiting for New India for their dreams. We must make concerted efforts to fulfil these dreams of every citizen. I am very confident to do so. We have put our efforts.

Earlier, lighting lamps, cutting ribbons and announcing schemes was considered to be government's work. Last mile delivery, as it was not the responsibility of the government, we have changed that culture.  We have also changed the policy, we have changed the strategy, and we have also changed the attitude and tendency. The result is ... Now here it is said that we did it, we did it, but homes for the poor were built earlier too - were they not built during the UPA, they were built. You will ask what new thing have we done? The new aspect is - you constructed 25 lakh houses in 5 years while we built 1.5 crore houses in 5 years, this is the change.

And that is why I think that we have tried to create a new environment, by going out of governmentization, we have emphasized simplification. We have seen that lack, influence and pressure were creating hurdles in fulfilling the dreams of the independent India even after so many years of Independence. The government did a few things whereby some people had to live in lack, some were frustrated due to influence and some had to live under pressure and walk on that path.

The government should definitely think of lack for the healthy development of the country but the common man must not be crushed under influence and pressure. We have embraced such a strategy and are working to empower every citizen of the country. Five years ago there was no electricity in crores of houses. There were no gas connections or toilets. They talked of big reform. But the country changes with small reforms. We should not be ashamed of small things. We shouldn't be so lofty. We have come from a small place among the ordinary people. Solving the problems of those ordinary people can bring huge results. That is why we have started working on it.

 

Fulfilling the aspirations of the people in the next 5 years:

 

This is certain that we have tried hard to fulfil the needs of the people in the last five years. The results are visible to a great extent. But now the nation's desire is more about fulfillment of aspirations than it needs. I believe that we are fortunate. We are fortunate that every citizen of the country is living with aspirations, be it political, social, business, education etc. When we human beings have aspirations, the work also gains momentum and the development process too speeds up. These are fortunate moments. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all us to take every decision for the aspirations of the common man. 

I am surprised, that negativity and opposition have increased to such levels that the issues of toilets and sanitation, Jan-Dhan account, even aspects like Make in India were mocked at. We have to make requests even for these things like going abroad. According to them the country has seen the negativity in everything in a way. Should we not respect each–other.

We know that we don't have majority in Rajya Sabha. Therefore, we shouldn't try to demean the decision taken by the people of India. Hon'ble Chairman, we have tolerated this constantly for 5 years. Therefore, Chairman Sir, we want protection because the people of India have entrusted the responsibility of fulfilling their aspirations to us by complete majority in Lok Sabha. Even the Federal structure of Rajya Sabha suggests that we should receive help and thus it is my request to you that you will do justice regarding the same.

With the expectation of turning into a 5 trillion dollars economy, we are moving ahead with the dream of New India. Has it been told to you that till 2014, India was a 2 trillion dollars economy? Today it has become 2.80 trillion. That is, after so many years of independence, it had become 2 trillion but within 5 years it has almost doubled. If it can increase by half in 5 years, then it can increase further in the coming 5 years. Secondly, we shouldn't have this question that why we are setting the target of 5 trillion dollars for the country's economy but instead we must think of working together to turn it into a 5 trillion dollars economy. Wherever we have state governments, we must try harder to improve the economy. You do it where your state government is. With concerted efforts, India will soon be among the 5 trillion dollars economy club. Everyone will be delighted! Hence, bring out positive thoughts. We are ready to hear you and accept your ideas. We are also ready to learn from you because we have to run the nation and work for its welfare. Thus, I want all of us to move ahead with these ideas.

There are a few more issues that need to be mentioned here. It was said in the House that Jharkhand has become a hub of mob lynching and mob violence. Hon'ble Chairman Sir, We all are deeply saddened by the murder of the youngster. The perpetrators should be given the toughest punishment! But is it right to blame only Jharkhand state? Then we won't find anyone doing any good work there. The miscreants must be isolated and they should be dealt with lawfully. We can play politics by accusing everyone but the situations won't change. Thus, none of us has the right to denounce Jharkhand. They are also citizens of our country, there is also plenty of gentlemen. And so, if there is an offense, the Constitution, law and order are fully capable to deal with it by law and justice. And its remedy is also legal expenditure, judicial process. And for that we should do as much as we can, not back off.

The biggest damage that terrorism has done in the world  is good terrorism and bad terrorism, mine terrorism and your terrorism. Anyway, we have also done these incidents of violence - whether that incident happens in Jharkhand, whether it happens in West Bengal, whether it happens in Kerala - we should have the same criteria, only then we will be able to stop the violence. Only then will those who commit violence get a lesson that this country is one on this one issue. All are political parties, everyone thinks, now nothing like this will work in the country. And I agree, let us fulfill that responsibility.

There are many other areas for gaining political brownie points. We can use them. I believe that it is our constitutional responsibility to guarantee the protection of our citizens. At the same time, it is our responsibility to be considerate towards humanity. We cannot deny that. Let us move ahead with the same spirit. We had started with the mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'; but with five years of constant dedication, the people have added another term to it - that is 'Sabka Vishwas'.

But our Azad Saheb is unable to see clearly. Things will be hazy till the time everything is being seen through the lens of politics. Thus I believe that if we start looking at things by removing those political lenses, we will be able to see a brighter future.

A lot of lecture was delivered here. Sometimes newspapers carry these things. However, during the Tuesday meetings whenever I publicly see things, I express my anger. I try to improve things. We got several complaints and accusations that an independent candidate was turned into our candidate and was helped in winning. That is the history of a few parties. The candidate for the post of President is also made to lose. This is individual politics. They also try to defeat Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Thus, before lecturing, they should look within.

When Sikhs were burnt alive by hanging wires around the streets of Delhi, and the people whose names came out loud, they were discussed in every way, they are still in that party, and they are holding respected posts, constitutional posts. If this is what your ideals and policies used to be, then there is a need to look into your community before preaching. Then you forget all these things, then you forget these and so ... And there will be many such examples. when there is a crisis of political jubilation - you expel from the party for ten days and then embrace, many examples will be found. There are names of great people and hence, please think before giving kindness to preach.

We are not so great in public life that we get the license to speak anything and everything. I also tell the same thing to my party members. We don't have any right to say anything to anyone. We have to be in our limits and follow the rules of public life. They might belong to any party. I want to tell my party members in particular that it is not right to do such a thing. I have said this publicly. But if we try, it will improve at some time, and we keep trying.

The only concern here is credit , it is very heavy. We have given all the credit to you, that is why we have come. It was your courage, which brings us, otherwise who knew this much. But I want to ask, NRC has been discussed here, will you not take its credit? Why are you running, brother? You also take credit for that too.

The Rajeev Gandhi government had accepted the NRC in the Assam Accord. Later the Supreme Court had to step in and we are implementing it on the directions of the Supreme Court. Take the credit for the Accord! You have to collect votes and also take the credit. Then you will tell half-truth to everyone. This is not done. You should tell at least a few things clearly. We are committed to implementing the decision regarding the NRC taken at that time. For us, it is not a vote-bank politics. It is the question of country's unity, integrity and a bright future. And we will do it!

Sardar Saheb was mentioned here. I felt happy. Probably the people from Congress won't agree but we still believe that had Sardar Saheb been the first Prime Minister of India, the issue of Jammu & Kashmir wouldn't have cropped up. We still believe that had Sardar Saheb been the first Prime Minister, the villages of the country wouldn't have faced any problem today. The nation would have a different image today. This is our idea. It could be wrong. But there could not be two opinions about the fact that Sardar Saheb, who was appointed as the first Home Minister of the country by Congress, had integrated more than 500 princely states. He lived and fought for Congress throughout his life. He also gave up his life for Congress.

During elections in Gujarat, Sardar Saheb is seen in posters but he is not seen anywhere during national elections. He was from your party. What issue do you have with him? But today I would like to request the senior leaders of Congress that at least they could go to the world's tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, and pay their tribute to Sardar Saheb. I would like Ghulam Nabi ji to spend a few days in Gujarat.

Let me tell you a very interesting story about how the old rules work here. If there is an airport or a dam, there will be a board saying 'photography not allowed'. Today we have such technology that can click the photo of the number plate of a two-wheeler parked outside the house from space. But old laws are still continuing. When the Sardar Sarovar dam used to overflow, at that time the government of Digvijay Singhji was in power there. They didn't allow the people to go there. When I became the Chief Minister, I asked them to change this rule. The people could come and take photos. Then I decided to charge entry fees so that a good parking lot could be created for the people. Then the 5th lakh visitor was honoured. I am glad that the 5th lakh visitor was a newly-wed couple from Baramullah and we honoured them. See, how things can be changed. That's why I say that you can have a meeting of the Congress Working Committee at the Statue of Unity sometime. You will feel good. We should pay out homage to the national heroes and we will continue to do that.

 

Publicity versus Awareness Campaign

Mr. Azad, you have been a Health Minister. Sometimes we should differentiate between Publicity and Awareness campaign. The advertisement that talks of behavioral change should not be considered as a government advertisement. If you want to tell the children that wash your hands before eating, you have to run a campaign for that. Although the expenses are borne by the government but that is not a government advertisement. When an epidemic broke out during your tenure as the Health Minister, you too had given advertisement asking people to boil water before drinking during epidemic. You will not be right if you call ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ an advertisement.

But it is really painful when we see that in the name of MGNREGA people are just dumping soil from one place to another. For three long years advertising was done in the country, although MGNREGA was not a behavioral change campaign. Yet advertisements were issued at government cost to establish a leader. The country will never forget it. Asking people to wash hands before eating is behavioral change. We have to understand the difference between Publicity and Awareness Campaign. Otherwise how the country will transform?

Prioritizing immunization and safe motherhood

Questions have been raised against Ayushman Bharat Yojana too. MPs of all the political parties have congratulated me in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on this one issue. Whenever they have written me to help poor sick persons of their constituencies from Prime Minister’s Relief Fund, I have told them do not look at the rule book for the poor; hundred per cent help should be given to them. For this cause MPs from almost all the political parties used to come to me.

The MPs who have written to the Prime Minister to help the poor of their constituencies know the power of Ayushman Bharat Yojana. Now a day, no MP writes such letters to the Prime Minister, because they know that the poor are getting the benefit from Ayushman Bharat Yojana; so there is no need to go to Prime Minister’s Office. This is a huge change. So far 30 lakh people have been benefited from Ayushman Bharat Yojana.

We are public representatives. We meet people. If I come across any negative thing or any deficiency, I tell people that bring it to my notice; together we will set that right. If we make Ayushman Bharat Yojana stronger, it will help the poor of the country in true sense. If a poor man, who is moving towards neo middle class, a disease can snatch away his 20 years savings. This is a humanitarian scheme. So please stop criticizing Ayushman Bharat Yojana. It will be a great work of humanity, so instead of criticizing Ayushma Bharat, and saying that Modi will take credit for it, that is over as the election result has come ... , now we should work together. Don't worry I am going to take new work for 2024,  so I would like to do it with  a little bit of cooperation.

Here we have discussed Bihar’s Encephalitis. It is a shame and painful thing for all of us. I admit that as a society, as a government whatever failures we have witnessed in the last seven decades, this is one of the biggest failures. I have seen things are slightly better in eastern UP, yet I do not claim that.

We have been stressing on universal immunization and safe motherhood during the last five years. I am constantly in touch with the State Government in this painful situation. I had sent our Health Minister to the State so that the Centre and the state could address the issue at the earliest. Be it nutrition, safe motherhood, or the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the more we will publicize these, the more we will be able to avoid the crises. Today a state is plagued with such a disease, tomorrow it may spread to some other state. If we become proactive, we can save people from such problems. 

Stress on the development of Aspirational Districts

Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas is not a political slogan. Certain areas of our country are lagging behind in terms of development. We have identified 112 aspirational districts. Certain states became apprehensive about it because of political compulsions. I am surprised, where is politics in this? When I was in Gujarat, if somebody was transferred to Kutch, he used to grumble as if he had been punished. No officer was willing to go there. Now Kutch has become one of the fastest developing districts of the country. In every state of the country there are one or two such districts. To change that psychology we have to engage young officers. I have talked to the states. Young officers have been engaged and a daily monitoring of these 112 districts is being done. Some parameters are being improved. By Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas, I mean, whichever district is lagging behind should be brought to such a level that their confidence is boosted and will try to move ahead.

We have focused on the North-east during the last five years. An environment has been created. We need to emphasize it more. Northeast is a very important unit for the nation and me. Therefore, it has been made mandatory for the Ministers to go there in the last five years. Not only in the state capitals but they have been directed to spend one night in some or the other district. My idea behind this is that ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas’ means all the areas of the country should also develop geographically.

Hydro power from Water conservation:

 

These days I have done water survey. About 226 districts are facing water-related issues. I am mobilizing everyone. I would like you to help in changing water conservation. How can we prioritize water in the MPLAD fund? How to provide funds for that work? Let us pull the country out of this problem. Let us make the society aware of the water related issues and conservation so that the future generations could be saved from the water problems. Therefore, a new Ministry named Jalshakti Ministry has been created that will work in the direction of water conservation. 

Like I said before, we have to turn the country into a 5 trillion dollar economy. There had been a lot of discussion here pertaining to the bankruptcy law. The impact of the Fugitives Economic Offenders Act and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is such that just due to the law Rs.3 lakh crores have returned to the banks. We should see the positive in this environment and we should try to find solutions in it. We should work together and I believe that we will soon get results of these efforts. Cooperative Federalism was discussed here. I believe that the framers of our Constitution have provided us with the document with a long vision so that we could move ahead by keeping the nation together.

Cooperative Competitive Federalism- it is essential to create an environment of competition among the states. We have to move ahead with the mantra of NARA - National Ambition with Regional Aspirations. But the question is can't there be such issues on which there is a unanimity? Can't that happen? Can't we create an environment by working on those issues where all of us are in agreement?

Gandhi @150 and independence@75 is one such opportunity. Can't we walk hand-in-hand in these events? Is Rajya Sabha not a part of the Federal structure? Are we an independent unit? No! We are a part of the same system. Lok Sabha has been elected by the people.

But will you keep creating hurdles here because we don't have numbers here? I understand you feel happy by humiliating us but what about the country? I am not criticizing anyone. I am only doing an analysis.

During the last five years, we have suspended several works on the verge of completion. You tell me. Once again the bills that had lapsed as those were not passed in the Rajya Sabha will be placed in the Lok Sabha. Once again, the process will incur so much expenditure; tax payers' money will go into it and so much time of the Parliament will be wasted. Our Rajya Sabha can also pass the bills because it is a part of a healthy federal structure and it is its responsibility to move ahead with the spirit of the Federal structure.

Whether you agree with us or not it's your wish but we all should agree with our former President Pranab da. I should agree and you all should agree. Pranab da had clearly said a very important thing. ""It is that the majority has got the mandate to rule and the minority has got the mandate to oppose"". I don't think there are two opinions on it. But the former President had further said - ""but nobody has got the mandate to obstruct"". I believe that we should move forward with the same mantra. Only then will the Federal structure work in its true sense. And the Rajya Sabha is a representative of the states. The aspirations of the states are expressed through you. You should move above your parties and raise your voices for the welfare of your states.

It is true that in a country like India it is difficult to give everything at the same time to every state. Some states might get before while the others later. Probably some states might not get at all. It happens and it has happened before. But is it right to stop the proceedings of the House just because of greater numbers in the House? I know the last time when the House was complete, both Anandji and Ghulam Nabiji were telling me-we have to do something. There is an issue of a few states but if some or the other MP keeps stopping the proceedings of the House; it is not right.

I believe that all of us together have to run the House and to take the nation forward. I also believe that Gandhi@150 and independence@75 is a center of inspiration. It is a date when we all together can take the leadership and ask the people to come forward and do something or the other. We can awaken the spirit of responsibility and duty in the people so that everyone is ready to sacrifice something. It is possible if we teach the students in schools to wash their hands before meals. We can make rules like - on Gandhi@150. I decide to do something new in my life. Someone can take a resolution like - I am a small boy but I will not waste food.

Our farmers can decide to use 10% less urea for the health of Mother Earth. Look at the period from 1942-1947. Gandhi ji had turned everyone into responsible citizens with these small things. We need not do anything new. We can move ahead with the model of Gandhi ji. We can decide to do something for the country. We have to awaken the spirit of duty. Each one of us can have a separate model for building a New India but we cannot keep the nation into the old system. The youth of the country has to make a New India according to its dreams.

I believe that the best points from the discussion can be used and we can take a few steps for the welfare of the country.

Once again I thank everyone who was a part of this discussion. Thanking the Hon'ble President on his speech, and thanking all of you, I end my speech.

 

Thanks a lot!

                I am visiting Osaka, Japan to attend G 20 Summit. I look forward to discussing the major challenges and opportunities faced by our world today with other global leaders. Women Empowerment, issues related to digitalization and artificial intelligence, and progress in achieving SDGs and in our common efforts to address major global challenges such as terrorism and climate change form the rich agenda of the Summit.



The Summit will provide an important opportunity to reiterate and reinforce our strong support to reformed multilateralism, which is crucial for preserving rule-based international order in today’s fast changing world. The Summit will also be a platform for sharing India’s strong developmental experience of the last five years, which provided the basis for a resounding mandate by the people of India to the Government to continue on the path to progress and stability.

The Osaka Summit will also be an important stepping stone for India towards hosting the G-20 Summit in 2022, when we usher in a New India in the 75th Anniversary year of our Independence.

On the sidelines, I also look forward to engaging with leaders of our major partner countries on important issues of bilateral and global importance.

I also look forward to host the next Russia, India and China (RIC) Informal Summit on the sidelines, and also to participate in the next informal meetings of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and JAI (Japan, America and India) leaders

                Hon'ble Speaker sir,

After the formation of the 17th Lok Sabha, I am present here to support the Motion of Thanks on Hon'ble President's speech. 

The Hon'ble President, in his speech, has tried to draw a blueprint of the things that we want to prioritize and emphasize to fulfill the aspirations of the common man of India. The President's speech is a resonance of the hopes and aspirations of the country with which they have sent us to this House, and therefore the Motion of thanks on his speech in a way is thanking crores of people of the country.

Several great men of our country have dreamt of a powerful, secure, prosperous and an inclusive nation. In order to fulfill that dream, we must move ahead together in a determined way and with greater intensity and speed. This is the need of the hour and India should not lose this opportunity in today's global environment.

We must move ahead together with the same spirit. I believe that we can cross every hurdle in fulfilling the aspirations of the country. Nearly 60 Hon'ble Members of Parliament had participated in this discussion. Those who have been elected for the first time have tried to place their points of view very well and have tried to make the discussion meaningful. Those who are experienced, too, have carried forward this discussion in their own way.

I am grateful to everyone including Mr. AdhirRanjan Chaudhary, Mr. T.R. Balu, Mr. DayanidhiMaran, Mr. SaugatRai, Jaydevji, Ms. MahuaMoitra, P.V. MidhunReddy, VinayakRaut, Rajeev Ranjan Singh, Pinaki Mishra, Shri NamaNageshwar Rao, Mohammad Azam Khan, AsaduddinOwaisi, Shri Pratap Chandra Sarangi, Dr. HinaGavit for making this discussion meaningful. 

It is true that we all are humans and the influence of the last 30 days still lingers. It is difficult to come out of it. Therefore, a little impact of the election speeches was still visible here. Similar stories were heard here. This is the rule of nature. You have run this House on this respectable position and have carried forward the discussion by taking everyone into consideration. You are new to this position. When there are new members, a few people want to put them into trouble right in the beginning.

However, despite these situations, you have worked everything out in a commendable way. I congratulate you all for that. And I am grateful to the House for cooperating with the new Speaker.

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

After several decades, the nation has given out a strong mandate. They have once again voted the same government to power with greater strength. Today in this simple environment, in a vibrant democracy like India, every Indian can feel proud of the fact that our voter is so aware. The voter loves the nation more than himself and takes decision for the nation. This was clearly discernable in this election. Therefore, many congratulations to the voters of the country. 

I and my entire team is glad that despite we being completely new and unfamiliar, in 2014, the nation gave us one opportunity as an experiment to come out of the circumstances. But the mandate of 2019 was given out by examining us in every way possible. They have tested us and understood us and only on that basis have once again voted us to power. This is the greatest strength of democracy. Everyone, the winner, the loser or those inside or outside the field had made successful efforts to implement the policies of 'सर्वजनहिताय, सर्वजनसुखाय' (means, 'for the good of all people, for the happiness of all') with hard work for the last five years for the welfare of the people. People have once again given their approval to it and elected to power to serve the country.

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

Nothing is more satisfying than the fact that the people who are a form of god approve one's work. It is not just a game of winning or losing or statistics. It is devotion, commitment, dedication towards the people. It is living and fighting for the people. The result of the five years' of unbroken commitment and dedication is equivalent to a spiritual experience. Therefore, I don't think about winning or losing. My thoughts go beyond it. The hopes, aspirations and dreams of the 130 crore people are always in my mind. 

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

In 2014, when the people of my country had given me the opportunity to put forth my viewpoints in the Central Hall for the first time, I had simply said that my government was dedicated to the poor. After those five years, I to my deepest satisfaction can say that the people have expressed their satisfaction by pressing the button of EVM machines. In the beginning of the discussion, the first time MP Shri PratapSarangiji and my sister from the tribal community Dr. HinaGavitji have placed all the nuances of the issues. After that I believe, there is no need for me to add anything more.

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

All the great personalities of our country who have guided us in the public life have always talked about one thing - the poorest of the poor and their welfare. Everyone such as Pujya Bapu, Baba SahebAmbedkarji, Lohiaji or DeenDayalUpadhyayji had said the same thing. During the last five years tenure, we have always worked with the spirit that those who have no one have government beside them. 

After independence, we have inadvertently accepted a culture and have let it spread wherein the common man had to overcome a lot of hurdles and challenges in the system to avail his rights. I am not accusing anyone. But shouldn't the common man be provided his rights by the system in a hassle-free way? We had assumed that the system was supposed to be like that. 

I know changing these things takes a long time. It is difficult to get the states onboard and it is tough to cure the 70 years old diseases in five years. But I am pleased to say that despite all the hurdles, we have not diverted or diluted our commitment and have continued to walk on the same path. This nation tells what is true and what is false. The nation realized that a toilet was not merely a concrete structure or the gas is not merely a means of cooking food. It understood the motive behind it as to why the government came up with those schemes? I never asked for a gas; I spent my entire life without electricity; then why are they doing this? Earlier the question used to be raised - 'why are they not doing it?' Today they have developed a confidence. So they ask, 'Why are they doing it?' The journey from 'why are they not doing?' to 'why are they doing it?' was quite long. But they had faith and today they are experiencing a new capability within the country. We are trying to carry the same forward.

This is true that when a welfare state is dealing with poverty, the people should be provided with ease of living through different welfare schemes but at the same time the nation should also progress. The poor people should be uplifted and empowered but at the same time modern India should also move forward. Therefore, the stream of development must flow on a path wherein welfare of the common man is the focuses on one hand while on the other schemes are being implemented to develop modern infrastructure.

And we have focused upon both. We have to create a modern India with the highways, I-ways, waterways, railways, roads, Airways through the UDAN scheme, start-ups, innovation, tinkering labs and well as the Chandrayaan. We have to fight against all the challenges.

Many new things have been told here. A few harsh things have also been said that reflect the election mood. Everyone has an individual agenda. I won't comment on that. However, we cannot make the mistake of saying that 'no one can demean our power' that was said here. We cannot waste our time demeaning anyone. 

You be happy with your loftiness. You are floating so high that you are unable to see the ground and have been detached from the roots. You look down upon the people who are on ground. Therefore, your high headedness is good for me. I hope you remain the same. We have no competition with you in terms of high headedness because our dream is to get rooted and be in close association with the people. 

Our dream is to be deeply tied to the roots to strengthen the nation. Therefore, we are not in the competition. Therefore, our best wishes are with you so that your loftiness continues to grow. It is true that a few people are used to being praised and mentioned. Not being mentioned is taken as an insult by them. This shouldn't be the case but it happens. 

Prior to 2004 was Atal ji's government. They had ruled from 2004 to 2014. I can challenge that they have not praised Atalji's government or mentioned his good initiatives even for once. Leave Atalji; they haven't even praised about the Narasimha Rao government. Moreover, have they mentioned anything about Dr. Manmohan Singh ji in the speech now? I am nothing compared to those great people! I am an ordinary person. But you can verify; From the Red Fort, I am the first Prime Minister who had said twice that every central and state government since independence has made essential contribution to the country's development. 

I have said the same thing several times even in this House. I would like to reiterate the same. Yes, they might have different expectations. But I would like to give you an example depicting our character, mindset and thinking. 

I had got the opportunity to work as Gujarat's Chief Minister for a long period. It was Golden Jubilee for Gujarat. So, that year, several events were organized taking everyone together. But today I want to mention about one important work. I informed that all the speeches if the Hon'ble Governors during the last 50 years should be compiled in a book and it should be recorded in history. Now tell me, Governors of the last 50 years belonged to which government's tenure? 

It was in a way, a compilation of accomplishments of the governments of that time. Those were not our party's governments. However, this is a part of our mindset wherein the contribution of everyone in the system who had played a role in carrying the nation forward is recognized. It was a positive exercise. It was a compilation not of newspaper editorials but of Governors' speeches. It is still available.

So, those who themselves have never recognized other's work, have no right to nag us or say that we didn't recognize previous governments' work. NarasimhaRaoji should have received Bharat Ratna award during his tenure; Dr. Manmohan Singhji should have received Bharat Ratna award after his first term.

But people outside the family never receive anything. But we are different. We have never worried about the party to which Pranab da belonged or for which party he had worked. Our decision to confer Bharat Ratna award on him was purely on the basis of his contribution to the nation. Therefore, kindly don't keep us nagging. Thus far and no further!

We don't reject anyone's contribution. And when I say that 125 crores Indians have taken the country forward, everyone is included in them. Therefore, kindly don't demean the discussion. 

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

They have raised many slogans of -'who did it?' Today is 25th June. Many people don't know the significance of 25th June. They are asking their neighbours. The nation's soul was crushed at the night of 25th June. Democracy in India was not born out of the pages of our Constitution. Democracy has been the soul of our nation since ages. The soul was crushed. Country's media was gagged. The great personalities of the nation were put behind the bars. Entire India was turned into a prison just to save someone's seat or power. That is a living example of dishonoring the Judiciary and it's judgment.

Today, on 25th June, once again we have to express our devotion and resolve towards democracy with greater intensity. No one can forget the sin of talking about the Constitution on one hand and squashing the Constitution on the other. All those who were party to this sin must remember that this slur is indelible. This should be reminded time and again so that no other person is born who would commit such a sin again. This is to remind not to abuse. 

This is just to remind the significance of devotion towards democracy. At that time when the media was gagged, and everyone was living under the fear of getting arrested, they gave out their verdict after elections. They voted for democracy and re-established democracy. This is the strength of my nation's voters. Once again, keeping caste, creed, sect, language aside the nation has voted only for a brighter future for the country.

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

The President has mentioned about two important events in his speech - Gandhi 150 and independence75. Be it the life of an individual, or of a family or community, few dates arouse a new zeal. It makes life exciting and arouses a feeling of fulfilling our resolutions. There is no greater inspiration for India than Pujya Bapu. Today there are memories of the brave-hearts sacrificing their lives for the nation. We should not lose this opportunity. 

Commemorating those who laid down their lives for the Nation, who spent their youth in serving Mother India, and commemorating Pujya Bapu who successfully led the freedom movement, and also making these dates as an opportunity, we can create a new spirit within the nation. This cannot be an agenda of the government or of any party. This is an agenda of the entire nation. There are no parties but only nation. The President has reiterated the same. This is the time for fulfilling resolutions. You can argue amongst each other in the election field but let us hold this opportunity. Before independence, people used to die for the nation but on the 75th year of independence now we have an opportunity to live for the nation. 

I have a request for all the representatives of the House. Let us come forward to follow the President's order, expectations and desires. And to build New India, let us try to link these two important opportunities with the common man. 

The period of colonization was long for India but there was no occasion in that period when people didn't revolt or the people hadn't laid down their lives for freedom from some part of the country or the other. An organized group emerged during 1857 but Mahatma Gandhi had made a major contribution. He had turned the common man into a freedom fighter. If he was sweeping, it was for freedom; if he was teaching students, it was for freedom; if he wore Khadi clothes, it was for freedom. 

Respectable Bapu had created such an environment in the entire country. And the entire nation was engaged in the 1942 Quit India Movement. 1942-1947 is an important turning point of the freedom struggle. Can we come forward to free the nation from troubles, to emphasize upon our responsibilities and to inspire the nation to fulfill our responsibilities with that spirit of Gandhi-150 and freedom75? 

I believe that the President has placed this before us in a very significant way. And when freedom was being demanded, people used to be surprised and used to wonder how would we run the nation. They used to mock at it. But the freedom fighters had a determination. Those sacrificing their lives for freedom had a different spirit of arousing that vigor in those living for freedom. This leadership has the caliber. 

I mean this for everyone. It's not just for me or my party. We can achieve this together. And it is not for my personal gains. I do not have such limited thinking. I never think small. Moreover, if I want to live the dreams of 125 crore Indians, I have no right to think small.

जब हौसला बना लिया ऊँची उड़ान का

फिर देखना फिजूल है कद आसमान का।

We must move ahead with this spirit and a new determination. It has been only three weeks after the formation of the new government. But there is a saying- पुत्र के लक्षण पालने में।

We too could have celebrated our victory. But we dis not choose that path. We could have thought of resting for a while after six months of election preparedness, but we don't like that. 

We don't choose that path. We have come to live for the nation. This government has taken several important decisions within three weeks. Every second was utilized and after 60 years the decision regarding pension for small shopkeepers, farmers and farm laborers was taken. 

We had promised that all the farmers will be brought under the PM Kisan SamriddhiYojana. It has been fulfilled. We have not only raised the scholarship of children of army-men but also have provided benefits to the children of police personnel; the police who is responsible for the security of the society. We have finished the preparations for tabling important human rights related laws in the Parliament. Just within three weeks, we have initiated all possible work ranging from calling meeting of Chief Ministers, organizing all-party meeting, all-party meeting of the Presidents and so on for fulfilling the dream of the year 2022. We I start counting then it might come out to be on an average three tasks per day. Therefore respected Speaker sir, the President has mentioned the same in his speech. I never said that the previous governments didn't do any work.

A discussion on construction of various dams was going on. It would have been better if the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar was also mentioned. All the water related initiatives within India were taken under the leadership of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. However, beyond a height people cannot see the ground. Baba Saheb used to talk about central waterways, irrigation and navigation. I believe that Baba Saheb's instructions are still valid and useful for us today. He used to say, 'Man suffers more from the lack of water than from access to it.' I think Baba Saheb expressed this concern. We must think of something on those lines.

Of all the discussions pertaining to dams, the Sardar Sarovar dam too was discussed. I wish to take some time Hon'ble Speaker sir. Sometimes rumors are spread. As per their ecosystem, they enjoy doing that. They never allow the truth to come out. There is no guarantee that the truth will come out even after I make clarifications today. It will remain here. Yet I would be content to follow my duty.

Pandit Nehru had laid the foundation stone of the Sardar Sarovar dam in 1961. It was the dream of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel but the foundation stone was laid in 1961. However, it wasn't approved for several decades. The foundation stone was laid without permission. At that time the project was worth Rs. 6000 crores. The cost rose to Rs.60,000-70,000 crores by its completion. 

What service did it do to the nation? Moreover, attempts were made to stop the project during the UPA regime. Between 1986-87, the cost of the project was Rs.6000 crores that reached Rs.62,000 crores. We came and completed the project. I had to sit on a hunger strike. I was the Chief Minister. Everything was stopped. Now the project is complete. Before I became the Prime Minister, I removed all these blockages within 15 days.

Today almost 4 crore people are getting access to water supply. Clean drinking water is now reaching seven metro cities, 107 municipalities and 9 thousand villages. The people of Rajasthan and Gujarat have known the scarcity of water. Therefore, we have formed a separate Jal Shakti Ministry. We have to consider the water related issue seriously. We must save as much water as possible in this season. 

I request the Hon'ble Members and the NGOs to increase the abundance of water in the country, working out of the government realm. We can save the lives of the common man by saving water. Water related issues affect two kinds of people the most - the poor and especially the mothers and sisters.

I am not sure what happened to our socialist friends but Lohiaji used to insist that women in the country have two problems viz. water and sanitation. Lohia Ji used to constantly insist upon getting the mothers and sisters rid of these problems. We have diligently worked towards fulfilling Lohia ji's dream of paying respect to mothers and sisters by constructing toilets and getting rid of the problem of sanitation. And we have moved ahead with the mantra of 'water to every household'.

I know this is a big and tedious task. Probably someone might judge it and fail me in my effort. They might give Modi 50 out of 100 marks instead of 70. But someone has to start it and we did it. I was talking about the Jal Shakti Ministry. After water conservation, water irrigation is the next responsibility. It has been proven in the world that micro-irrigation is beneficial for sugarcane cultivation. Who would make this understand to the farmers? Who would tell them about the benefits of micro-irrigation? With the government's scheme, funds will be received and water can be saved. There are several such things. We have to carry our nation forward by saving every drop of water. 

Agriculture is the backbone of our country's economy. It is the backbone of our rural economy. However, we have to come out of the outdated processes and systems. We have to ensure lowering of input cost. The experiments on zero budgeting are becoming successful. There is no reduction in the yield. In the era of holistic healthcare, quality is being improved.

We have worked without getting involved in politics and without considering any event as a government event. We have to work together for the welfare of the country's farmers. We must do hand-holding of the farmers. There is no investment of the corporate world in agriculture. We must encourage them. We must frame some rules and laws for them. Otherwise, someone believes that providing a tractor is investment. But we require investment of corporate world in food processing and building warehouses and cold storage. This is the need of the hour and we must work to boost the same. 

A system must be built from seed to the market by providing maximum opportunity to the farmers with the help of APOs. This will create immense possibilities in exports in the agriculture sector. We must emphasize upon those sectors. 

Last time in 2014, the price of pulses had become an issue. But look at the spirit of the farmers. I had made a simple request to them to come forward for pulse cultivation. And my farmers worked hard to provide pulse requirement of the nation. After pulses, we need to encourage the farmers for oilseeds. The nation should not have any need for import of oil, edible oil.

I believe that the country's farmers can be inspired. With a futuristic vision, we can work by dovetailing rural economy with the farmer's strength and country's needs. We must move ahead in that direction. 

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

This is true that statistics can be used in every manner for criticism. Fulfillment of the nation's dreams at one time period is something to cheer about but the same achievement in the other time period becomes an unacceptable thing. In the same House, when India had risen up from 13th to 11th position in terms of economy, there was a great enthusiasm and benches were tapped. It was projected as a great achievement. But now as India has improved to 6th position, the enthusiasm was lost. The country is the same and we are the people of the same nation. If improvement to 11th place makes us happy, it should make us happier when we reached 6th place.

How long will be so lofty that we are unable to see the ground? Why shouldn't a 5 trillion dollars economy be the dream of all of us? Who will lose if all of us together carry the nation towards 5 trillion economy? Everyone will benefit. And I believe that we all must work hard for it. We must move ahead with that dream. The 'Make in India' scheme was mocked at but can anyone deny its role within the country?

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

I am not here to criticize anyone and I don't want to waste my time either. I have a lot of things to do. But it is important to inform the nation about a few things. Our nation has an experience of 200-225 years in manufacturing metal. After independence, we had 18 factories that manufactured metal while China was in zero position. China had no experience. Today China is exporting defence goods around the world while we are the number one importer. We need to pull the country out of this truth. What will you do by mocking 'Make in India'? Probably you will get a good night's sleep but it will not do any good to the nation. 

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

I am really grateful to you as well as to the House for giving me the opportunity to speak. We need to find ways whereby India can enter the group of top five economies, exports are increased, Make in India is promoted further and the youngsters in the realm of start-ups are encouraged. We need to promote 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan and Jai Anusandhan. We need to ensure employment opportunities for the youth. There is immense possibility in the tourism sector of our country. But we have created such an impression for our country that we failed to attract the pride of the world for our nation.

The sanitation campaign has given us the strength. We can emphasize upon tourism. And the possibility of employment can rise in the country. We can create a new identity of the nation in terms of tourism before the world. We must take these things forward. We must take the nation forward towards infrastructure in the coming days. Even Rs.100 lakh crores will be a small amount as compared to the requirement of the country. 

But we must take this huge dream forward and we must utilize the aid and the arrangements provided by the world. Our dream of New India, Modern India and Ease of Living lies behind it. We must ensure that the common man has access to comfortable life and all the means to fulfil his dreams. We have to develop such systems. We must provide equal opportunity to everyone, be it a village or a city. 

Today we talk of demographic dividend. The nation possesses youth power. But are we able to prepare our youth in accordance with the world's requirements? We need to do a lot of things. We have to raise the scale of skill development and have to capture every scope. The Hon'ble President has told us how we can move towards modernity. 

The government has come up with GeM for the market. I would like all the state governments; irrespective of the party they belong to, to use the GeM portal. A huge amount of money will be saved and it will benefit many. Any person can sell his product to the government. I request all to work towards it.

We will continue with our fight against corruption. We are being rebuked for not putting a few people in jail. This is not an emergency period that we will put anyone in prison. This is democracy. The Judiciary is there to do this task. We work lawfully. One can enjoy if they get bail. One shouldn't work with a feeling of revenge. But we will continue with our fight against corruption. Whatever we do we will be doing it with honesty. We will not do anything with bitter feelings against anyone. The nation has provided a lot to us. Hence, we need not walk on the wrong path. Technology can be utilized at a greater rate. 

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

Why should there be a difference of opinion with regard to terrorism? It is a big threat to humanity. It is a challenge for humanity. Whoever believes in humanity must gather and fight against it. 

Congress had several opportunities for ensuring women empowerment. But they are so lofty that they are unable to see a few things. The Uniform Civil Code was being discussed in the 50s decade. Congress had the opportunity but it missed it. And they started with the Hindu Code Bill.

35 years later, Congress had the second opportunity. The Supreme Court had helped Shah Bano completely. A favorable environment for gender equality was created in the country. But they refused to see the things below from that height and consequently missed the opportunity. 35 years later, today, once again the Congress has this opportunity. We have come up with the bill. It is not necessary that we link the pride of the country's women to any religion or sect. 

A few ministers during the Shah Bano case had given shocking statements in a TV interview. I don't have ways to verify it but I am telling you what I have heard. One of the Ministers from Congress, during the Shah Bano case, had said that ensuring the welfare of the Muslims was not the responsibility of the Congress. It is something serious. ""If they want to lie in the gutter, let them"". You will get it on YouTube. I will send you the link.

Hon'ble Speaker sir,

I won't take long but with respect to Gandhi-150 and independence-75 mentioned by the Hon'ble President, I would say, for some reason everything was centered around rights. Everyone was concerned with rights. This is an opportunity whereby we can ensure a paradigm shift within the country by carrying it towards duties from rights. The responsibility of the people's representatives is also to awaken the people's conscience and to lead the way. Most of us have heard about the power of duties.

Mahatma Gandhi used to say - every right carries with it a corresponding duty ! Lohiaji used to say - nobody looks at a loss while doing one's duty. I want to throw some light on this quote. It's a very old saying. ""India has taught the world that duties come first here. Rights emanate from these duties. In today's modern materialist world where conflicts are seen everywhere, everyone talks about their rights and convenience; one rarely talks about the duties. This is the reason for the conflicts. This is the reality. We fight for rights and facilities only, but if we forget the duties in doing so, then these rights and facilities will not be left to us. ""

It is our responsibility to commemorate that great personality who had said these words and was forgotten. Can we take these ideas forward? That great personality has said these words on 14th July 1951 when the Congress manifesto was released before the elections. At that time, the great personality, Pandit Nehru had read this one paragraph during the announcement. 

Can we move ahead with the dream of Pandit Nehru of 1951 and ensure its fulfillment? Let us decide together and try to move forward.

In the history of our country, while Mahatma Gandhi had appealed to the youngsters to leave books and join the freedom struggle, people had come forward for the same; while Gandhiji had asked to boycott the foreign goods and embrace the Indian goods, people had obliged. When Lal Bahadur Shastriji had appealed to the people to leave one meal per day and help in increasing the productivity, people had obliged. While a small person like me had requested the people to give up the gas subsidy, people gave up. That is, the country is ready.

Come let us move beyond the boundaries of politics for building a New India and a modern India. The nation is bigger than politics. The nation is bigger than any political party. There are hopes and aspirations of crores of people of the country. Welcoming and thanking the Hon'ble President for the guidance and direction shown by him for fulfilling those aspirations, I not only thank him for the speech but also hope that we do something in the spirit of that speech for the welfare of the nation.

With this expectation, I end my speech while honouring the Hon'ble Members who enrich all this discussion.

I also thank you, Speaker sir!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today replied to the motion of thanks on the President’s address to Parliament, in the Lok Sabha. He thanked the members of the House, especially the first time Parliamentarians, for taking part in the debate. He added that the President’s address envisions a New India, as dreamt by millions of Indians.

Speaking about the strong mandate of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, PM said that people of India have re-elected a stable government once again, after evaluating its performance.

“The 2019 Lok Sabha elections shows that the people of India are thinking about the good of the nation. This spirit is wonderful”, PM said. He added that it is satisfying to be given the opportunity to serve 130 crore Indians and do work that has made a positive difference in the lives of citizens.

Highlighting the vision of the Union Government, PM said that the government believes in public welfare and modern infrastructure. He said that the government never diverted from the development path, nor diluted the development agenda. “It is important that the country progresses, every Indian is empowered and our nation has modern infrastructure.” PM added.

The Prime Minister said that his government believes that each and every citizen has contributed towards India’s progress. He also reminded the House of the dark days following the imposition of Emergency.

Terming 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and 75 years of India’s independence as landmark occasions in the history of India, the Prime Minister urged everyone to observe these with great vigour. He said that the citizens of the country should strive to build the India, our freedom fighters dreamt of, and live for the nation.

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has taken many pro-people decisions within weeks of taking charge. He said that those decisions will immensely benefit farmers, traders, youngsters and various other sections of the society. He added that the government has begun fulfilling the promises made to the nation.   

On the importance of water conservation, Shri Modi mentioned about the steps taken by the Union Government including the constitution of ‘Jal Shakti’ Ministry. He urged the people to take concrete steps to save water. He said that the water crisis affects the poor and women the most. He reiterated that the government is committed towards the task of bringing water to every household. 

The Prime Minister asked for a collective endeavour to make India a five trillion dollar economy. He added that promoting tourism and improving tourism infrastructure augurs well for economic prosperity. He also cited the importance of ’Make in India’ and skill development. 

Shri Modi asserted that there is no place for corruption in the nation. He said that the government will continue its fight against corruption. He said that the government is committed towards ensuring Ease of Living for all its citizens and urged everyone to work towards creating a New India.

                On stage, Governor Draupadi ji, the Chief Minister, the ministers of the Union and state governments and my dear brothers and sisters of Jharkhand. 

Best wishes to all of you, to the entire nation and the world on the occasion of International Yoga Day. A very good morning to the countrymen from this ' Prabhat Tara Maidan'. Today this 'Prabhat Tara Maidan' is glowing on the world map. This honour has been bestowed upon Jharkhand today. Today lakhs of people have gathered in various parts of the country and the world to celebrate Yoga Day. My heartfelt thanks to them. 

The crucial role played by our media friends and those associated with social media to publicize yoga around the world is extremely essential. I also express my gratitude to them. 

Friends,

Coming to Jharkhand for celebrating Yoga Day in itself is a pleasant experience. I am grateful to you all for coming out of your houses early in the morning from far flung places. Many people have this question in their mind about why did I come to Ranchi in particular for celebrating the fifth Yoga Day. Brothers and sisters, although I have deep attachment with Ranchi, there are three major reasons for me to come to Ranchi today. First- as the name of 'Jharkhand' suggests, it is a forested land. It is very close to nature and the harmony between humans and nature gives a completely different feeling to human beings. The second major reason for coming here was that the relationship between Ranchi and healthcare has been recorded in the pages of history. On 23 September last year, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, we launched the Ayushman Bharat Scheme from Ranchi. Today, the world's largest healthcare scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Arogya Yojana has become the greatest deal for the poor in a very short time. We understand the importance of yoga in making the Indians healthy. Therefore, coming to Ranchi today really holds importance for me. 

 

Brothers and Sisters, 

Now all of us have to carry this Yoga campaign to a different level and this is third and the biggest reason for me to come to Ranchi.

Friends, 

Yoga has always been in our country and has been an integral part of our culture. The 'Chhau dance' of Jharkhand also depicts different Asanas and Postures. But it is true that the journey of modern Yoga has not penetrated well to the rural and tribal areas of the country. Now all of us have to carry the journey of modern Yoga from the cities to the villages, forests and remote areas. I have to make Yoga an inseparable part of the lives of the poor and tribal people because it is the poor that suffers the most due to illness. An illness makes the poor even poorer. Thus, at a time, when poverty is declining at a faster rate, Yoga is a crucial medium for those who are coming out of poverty.

Friends,

Making lives easier just through facilities is not enough. The solutions in the form of medicines and surgery is not enough. In today's changing times, it is important for us to focus more on wellness along with prevention from the illness. We get the same power through Yoga. Yoga as well as the ancient Indian philosophy share the same spirit. Yoga can not be performed only by doing it for half an hour on the ground, on the floor, or on the mattress; Yoga is a discipline, a dedication, and it has to be performed and observed throughout life. Yoga is beyond any kind of discrimination in terms of age, colour, caste, creed,  wealth, poverty, province or boundaries. Yoga is for all and everyone belongs to Yoga. 

 

Friends,

During the last five years, our government has tried to make Yoga a strong pillar of Preventive Health Care by linking yoga with Health and Wellness. Today we can assert that awareness of yoga in India has reached every segment - from the drawing room to bedroom, from the parks to the sports complex in cities, from the streets to the wellness centers; today Yoga is being experienced everywhere. 

 

Brothers and sisters,

It gives me immense pleasure and satisfaction when I see that the younger generation is connecting this traditional method with modernity and publicizing it. With the help of innovative and creative ideas of the youth, Yoga has become more popular and lively than before. Friends, on this occasion today, the Prime Minister's Award for Promotion & Development of Yoga has been announced by our Minister. A jury had decided it and these people have been picked out from around the world after a lot of hard work. I appreciate the dedication of the award winners towards Yoga. 

 

Friends,

This year's theme for the International Yoga Day is ‘Yoga for Heart Care’. Heart care has become a challenge for the entire world today. There has been a manifold increase in the number of heart disease cases over the last two -two and a half decades in India. It is really unfortunate that the problem related to heart ailments has increased in the youngsters now. In such a scenario, it is important to make Yoga a part of Prevention and Treatment besides heart care awareness. I will urge the local yoga ashrams here to take further steps in propagating Yoga. I urge Ashrams like Rikhyapeethyog Ashram, Yogda Satsanga Sakha Ashram of Ranchi and other institutes to make arrangements centred around the theme of 'Heartcare Awareness'. 

 

Friends,.

With good health, there is a desire of achieving greater heights in life. An exhausted body and a broken mind can neither create dreams nor fulfil the aspirations. When we talk of best health, we need to remember the four 'Pa' i.e. Pani, Poshan, Paryawaran and Parishram ( water, nutrition, environment and hard work). There should be clean water, adequate nutrition, clean environment like clean air and also hard work should be made a part of life. 

 

Friends, 'Pa' will give results. Friends, I thank people across the world for joining the Yoga Day celebrations. World over the first rays of the sun are being welcome by dedicated yoga practitioners is a beautiful sight. I urge you all to embrace yoga and make it an integral part of your daily routine. Yoga is ancient and modern. It is constant and evolving. For centuries the essence of yoga has remained the same- Healthy body, stable mind, spirit of oneness, yoga provides a perfect blend of Gyan or knowledge, Karma or work and Bhakti or devotion. Yoga will make every individual better in thoughts, action and spirit. 

Friends, the importance of practicing yoga is greater than perhaps ever before. We live in a time when diseases related to lifestyle and stress are increasing. This come with the fast routines and pressures at the work place. It pains me to read about bright young men and women being affected by substance abuse, alcoholism, diabetes and such other evils. 

Yoga offers a solution for these problems. Yoga also furthers unity among people and in our society. This can heal several challenges, that our world faces. 

Friends, peace, harmony have also being associated with yoga. On the occasion of the 5th International Yoga Day, let our motto be Yoga for peace, harmony and progress. 

 

Brothers and sisters,

After International Yoga Day, we have taken several influential steps. We can also see the benefits of the same. Keeping in view the future, we have to work relentlessly to make Yoga the part of every person's life and habit. The role of Yoga teachers, practitioners and institutions will going to expand for the same. Getting manpower ready and human resource development are necessary for making Yoga a part of the lives of crores of people. This will only be possible if we develop the standards associated with yoga and institutions. And so our government is moving forward with this idea.

Friends,

Today the world is embracing our Yoga. Hence, we must also focus upon research related to Yoga. Just as the software of our mobile phones keeps getting updated, similarly, we need to update the world with new information on Yoga. Therefore, it is essential that we do not keep Yoga limited. Yoga must be linked with medical, physiotherapy, artificial intelligence. Moreover, we have to encourage the private enterprise spirit associated with yoga; only then, we will be able to expand yoga.

Our government is working in various areas, keeping these requirements in mind. I once again wish you good health and my best wishes to you all on the occasion of International Yoga Day. And I hope that all the Asanas that we will be performing here today, keep on increasing the duration of the same gradually. Don't do it excessively. You will notice the amazing results of the same in your lives. 

 

I once again offer my best wishes to you all for the best health, peace, harmony and a well-aligned life.

 

Come, let us begin Yoga now.

 

I also congratulate the Jharkhand government for making such grand arrangements in such a short span of time. They had no idea about it beforehand. Just two weeks ago, after the formation of the government, this idea of holding this grand event in Ranchi came to my mind. But the people of Jharkhand have achieved a great success in such a short time. I congratulate you all and the government for this.

 

Thank you!

                On stage, Governor Draupadi ji, the Chief Minister, the ministers of the Union and state governments and my dear brothers and sisters of Jharkhand. 

Best wishes to all of you, to the entire nation and the world on the occasion of International Yoga Day. A very good morning to the countrymen from this ' Prabhat Tara Maidan'. Today this 'Prabhat Tara Maidan' is glowing on the world map. This honour has been bestowed upon Jharkhand today. Today lakhs of people have gathered in various parts of the country and the world to celebrate Yoga Day. My heartfelt thanks to them. 

The crucial role played by our media friends and those associated with social media to publicize yoga around the world is extremely essential. I also express my gratitude to them. 

Friends,

Coming to Jharkhand for celebrating Yoga Day in itself is a pleasant experience. I am grateful to you all for coming out of your houses early in the morning from far flung places. Many people have this question in their mind about why did I come to Ranchi in particular for celebrating the fifth Yoga Day. Brothers and sisters, although I have deep attachment with Ranchi, there are three major reasons for me to come to Ranchi today. First- as the name of 'Jharkhand' suggests, it is a forested land. It is very close to nature and the harmony between humans and nature gives a completely different feeling to human beings. The second major reason for coming here was that the relationship between Ranchi and healthcare has been recorded in the pages of history. On 23 September last year, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, we launched the Ayushman Bharat Scheme from Ranchi. Today, the world's largest healthcare scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Arogya Yojana has become the greatest deal for the poor in a very short time. We understand the importance of yoga in making the Indians healthy. Therefore, coming to Ranchi today really holds importance for me. 

 

Brothers and Sisters, 

Now all of us have to carry this Yoga campaign to a different level and this is third and the biggest reason for me to come to Ranchi.

Friends, 

Yoga has always been in our country and has been an integral part of our culture. The 'Chhau dance' of Jharkhand also depicts different Asanas and Postures. But it is true that the journey of modern Yoga has not penetrated well to the rural and tribal areas of the country. Now all of us have to carry the journey of modern Yoga from the cities to the villages, forests and remote areas. I have to make Yoga an inseparable part of the lives of the poor and tribal people because it is the poor that suffers the most due to illness. An illness makes the poor even poorer. Thus, at a time, when poverty is declining at a faster rate, Yoga is a crucial medium for those who are coming out of poverty. Embracing Yoga will mean saving them from the clutches of disease and poverty.

 

Friends,

Making lives easier just through facilities is not enough. The solutions in the form of medicines and surgery is not enough. In today's changing times, it is important for us to focus more on wellness along with prevention from the illness. We get the same power through Yoga. Yoga as well as the ancient Indian philosophy share the same spirit. Yoga can not be performed only by doing it for half an hour on the ground, on the floor, or on the mattress; Yoga is a discipline, a dedication, and it has to be performed and observed throughout life. Yoga is beyond any kind of discrimination in terms of age, colour, caste, creed,  wealth, poverty, province or boundaries. Yoga is for all and everyone belongs to Yoga. 

 

Friends,

During the last five years, our government has tried to make Yoga a strong pillar of Preventive Health Care by linking yoga with Health and Wellness. Today we can assert that awareness of yoga in India has reached every segment - from the drawing room to bedroom, from the parks to the sports complex in cities, from the streets to the wellness centers; today Yoga is being experienced everywhere. 

 

Brothers and sisters,

It gives me immense pleasure and satisfaction when I see that the younger generation is connecting this traditional method with modernity and publicizing it. With the help of innovative and creative ideas of the youth, Yoga has become more popular and lively than before. Friends, on this occasion today, the Prime Minister's Award for Promotion & Development of Yoga has been announced by our Minister. A jury had decided it and these people have been picked out from around the world after a lot of hard work. I appreciate the dedication of the award winners towards Yoga. 

 

Friends,

This year's theme for the International Yoga Day is ‘Yoga for Heart Care’. Heart care has become a challenge for the entire world today. There has been a manifold increase in the number of heart disease cases over the last two -two and a half decades in India. It is really unfortunate that the problem related to heart ailments has increased in the youngsters now. In such a scenario, it is important to make Yoga a part of Prevention and Treatment besides heart care awareness. I will urge the local yoga ashrams here to take further steps in propagating Yoga. I urge Ashrams like Rikhyapeethyog Ashram, Yogda Satsanga Sakha Ashram of Ranchi and other institutes to make arrangements centred around the theme of 'Heartcare Awareness'. 

 

Friends,.

With good health, there is a desire of achieving greater heights in life. An exhausted body and a broken mind can neither create dreams nor fulfil the aspirations. When we talk of best health, we need to remember the four 'Pa' i.e. Pani, Poshan, Paryawaran and Parishram ( water, nutrition, environment and hard work). There should be clean water, adequate nutrition, clean environment like clean air and also hard work should be made a part of life. 

 

Friends, 'Pa' will give results. Friends, I thank people across the world for joining the Yoga Day celebrations. World over the first rays of the sun are being welcome by dedicated yoga practitioners is a beautiful sight. I urge you all to embrace yoga and make it an integral part of your daily routine.

Yoga will make every individual better in thoughts, action and spirit. 

Friends, the importance of practicing yoga is greater than perhaps ever before. We live in a time when diseases related to lifestyle and stress are increasing. This come with the fast routines and pressures at the work place. It pains me to read about bright young men and women being affected by substance abuse, alcoholism, diabetes and such other evils.

Just as the software of our mobile phones keeps getting updated, similarly, we need to update the world with new information on Yoga. Therefore, it is essential that we do not keep Yoga limited. Yoga must be linked with medical, physiotherapy, artificial intelligence. Moreover, we have to encourage the private enterprise spirit associated with yoga; only then, we will be able to expand yoga.

                Hon'ble Speaker sir,

It is a moment of immense joy and pride for all the members of this House to see you occupying this position. The old members are already very well familiar with you. Even as a legislator, you have played a proactive role in Rajasthan and people related to politics are familiar with the same. 

It is a matter of pride for all of us that we are approving of such a personality for the Speaker's post unanimously today, who has been engaged in public life without any break in some way or the other since student life by joining the student organizations and leading the university's student activities. Also as a worker of the Bharatiya Janata Party, he came out of the student movement and worked in the Yuva Morcha organization for nearly 15 years at the district, the state and the national levels. I had got the opportunity to work for the organization for several years. Therefore, both of us got the opportunity to work together as colleagues. 

The land of Kota has in a way become the Kashi of education. Those prioritizing career have Kota in their minds - living in Kota, studying in Kota and earning a livelihood in Kota. This small city of Rajasthan has in a way become a mini India. And this transformation of Kota has been brought about by the leadership, contribution and initiative of Shri Om Birla ji. 

Usually an image has been created in public life for politicians, as if we keep on playing politics and engage in arguments and fights all the time to defeat each other! However, there is a truth which sometimes doesn't emerge. Recently, the nation has realized that the more the percentage of social service is in the political life, the more is the acceptance in the society. The era of hardcore politics is fading away. Om Birla ji is such a personality for whom association with politics was quite natural as a public representative, but instead his entire work life has revolved around social service. Whenever there is any problem in social life, he is the one to reach out first. I clearly remember that during the Gujarat earthquake, he had been in Gujarat for a long time. He had brought the young colleagues from his area. Without using any local facility, he served the people by using his own available resources for a long period of time. During the calamity in Kedarnath, once again he was there with his group to serve the people. Even in Kota, during winters, if someone didn't have a blanket, all night he would roam about in Kota and arrange blankets through public participation and distribute to the needy. He had a mission in his public life that would inspire all the MPs like us. His mission was to ensure that no one in Kota should go to bed hungry and hence he had started a scheme called 'Prasadam'. It is still in place. Under the Prasadam scheme, he used to feed the hungry people through public participation. Similarly, he had started a Paridhan scheme to provide clothes to the poor and the destitute. Through the Paridhan movement he also used to collect shoes for the poor. If someone is ill, if blood donation is to be arranged or any other service is required in hospitals he will do that through public participation. In a way, more than anything else his political focus has been public service rather than public movement. 

Now that such a sensitive personality is occupying the position of the Speaker, I believe that because of leading a life of social compassion for years together and being in a responsible position, as a catalytic agent he will discipline us, inspire us and this House will provide its best to the country. He will be able to deliver in a better way.

We have seen that even within the House, he has an extremely polite way of smiling and speaking. Sometimes I feel scared that someone might take advantage of his humility and conscience. Earlier the Speaker of the Lok Sabha had to face a lot of challenges while the challenges before the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha used to be comparatively lesser. However, now the scenario has become the opposite. If we recall the previous session, everyone would agree that our Speaker Madam was always jolly and smiling. Even if she had to pull up someone, she would laugh after rebuking. But she had developed a new tradition. I assure you, Speaker sir, on behalf of this House and Treasury bench that we will put 100% of our efforts to make your work simpler. In case rules are being flouted or obstacles are being created in running of this House by this bench, you will have every right to tell them, to point out to the people of our stature and we will welcome this. This is because it is the responsibility of all of us to maintain the dignity of the House. Earlier the first three-four years used to be peaceful; only the election year used to be a little problematic. But now that there is an election in every 3-4 months, people want to give out messages from here. Such situations might give you stress. Yet the House will try to ensure that there is a good quality debate and discussions over important topics and the decisions are taken collectively. With this hope, my best wishes to you on behalf of the House and the Treasury bench. Thank you!

                 Friends,

This is the first session after the elections and the formation of new Lok Sabha. This is an opportunity to introduce new colleagues and when new colleagues join, then new aspirations, new zeal and new dreams too are associated with them. What makes Indian democracy so special? We realize the special features and strength of the Indian democracy during every election. This time in Parliamentary election we have seen the maximum percentage of voting and the maximum number of women representatives since independence. More number of women had voted this time as compared to earlier occasions. This election had been full of several unique features. After several decades, a government has been given the opportunity to serve the public with absolute majority for the second consecutive time and with more number of seats than before. During the last five years we have seen that, whenever the House was in session and had run in a healthy environment, the decisions for the welfare of the nation had also been very good. On the basis of those experiences I hope and I believe that all the parties will hold discussions, debates and take decisions in public interest and take steps for fulfilling the aspirations of the people in the best possible way. We had started our journey of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'; but the people of the country have added an amazing ‘faith’ or ‘Viswas’ to that ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. And with that faith we will definitely put our best efforts to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the common man. 

 

The presence of a proactive opposition is a mandatory pre-condition of democracy. I hope that the opposition should now stop worrying about numbers. The public has given certain numbers to them; but for us their every word and feeling is precious. And when we are inside the House, occupying the chair as MPs, the spirit of neutrality becomes all the more important than who is in power and who is in the opposition. And I believe that keeping animosity at bay, we will try to uphold the dignity of the House by working for the public welfare in an unbiased way in the next five years. I am confident that our Houses will be more productive than before, and we will get the opportunity to work with more zeal, speed and better collective thinking for public interest.

 

There are several members in the House who make debates lively and place some wonderful thoughts and ideas; but as most of it is constructive, it doesn't match with the TRPs. But sometimes the members will get the opportunity even beyond the TRPs. If the government is criticized in a constructive way, followed by reasons and arguments by a Parliamentarian in the House, it boosts the democracy. I have a lot of expectations from all of you in strengthening the democracy. We will certainly fulfil those expectations but you all can play a positive role in strengthening this spirit over the next five years. If you play a positive role and spread positive thoughts then everyone would be inclined towards positivity. Therefore, I invite you all to move together towards new zeal, new faith, new resolution and new dreams during the 17th Lok Sabha. Let us leave no stone unturned in fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the common man. With this belief, thank you all!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today delivered the opening remarks at the fifth meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog, in RashtrapatiBhawan Cultural Centre in New Delhi.

Welcoming the Governor of J&K, Chief Ministers, Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and other delegates, the Prime Minister reiterated that NITI Aayog has a key role to play in fulfilling the mantra of SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas, SabkaVishwas.  

Recalling the recent General Elections as the world's largest democratic exercise, the Prime Minister said that it is now time for everyone to work for the development of India. He spoke of a collective fight against poverty, unemployment, drought, flood, pollution, corruption and violence etc. 

The Prime Minister said that everyone at this platform has a common goal of achieving a New India by 2022. He described Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and PM AwaasYojana as illustrations of what the Centre and the States can accomplish together. 

The Prime Minister said that empowerment, and ease of living, have to be provided to each and every Indian. He said the goals that have been set for the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, should be accomplished by October 2nd, and work should begin in earnest towards the goals for 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence. 

The Prime Minister stressed that the focus should be on collective responsibility for achieving short term and long term goals.  

Shri Narendra Modi said that the goal to make India a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024, is challenging, but can surely be achieved. He said States should recognise their core competence, and work towards raising GDP targets right from the district level. 

Noting that the export sector is an important element in the progress of developing countries, he said both the Centre and the States should work towards growth in exports, in order to raise per capita incomes. He said there is immense untapped export potential in several States, including the North Eastern States. He said a thrust on export promotion at the State level will provide a boost to both income and employment. 

Describing water as an important element for life, the Prime Minister said that the poor bear the brunt of insufficient water conservation efforts. He said that the newly created Jal Shakti Ministry will help provide an integrated approach to water. He urged States to also integrate their efforts towards water conservation and management. He said management of available water resources is a vital imperative. He said that the aim is to provide piped water to every rural home by 2024. He said attention has to be given to water conservation, and raising the water table. He appreciated the efforts made by several States towards water conservation and management. He said rules and regulations, such as model building bye-laws, also need to be framed for water conservation and management. He added that district irrigation plans under the the PM KrishiSinchaiYojana should be implemented carefully. 

The Prime Minister called for effective steps to tackle drought. He said that the spirit of per-drop, more-crop needs to be promoted. 

Reiterating the Union Government's commitment to double incomes of farmers by 2022, he said this requires focus on fisheries, animal husbandry, horticulture, fruits and vegetables. He said that the benefits of PM-KISAN - KisanSammanNidhi - and other farmer centric schemes should reach the intended beneficiaries well within time. Noting that there is need for structural reform in agriculture, the Prime Minister spoke of the need to boost corporate investment, strengthen logistics, and provide ample market support. He said the food processing sector should grow at a faster pace than foodgrain production. 

Turning to aspirational districts, the Prime Minister said that the focus should be on good governance. He said improvement in governance has led to remarkable progress in several aspirational districts. Giving several examples, he said out-of-the-box ideas, and innovative service delivery efforts in some of these districts have also delivered outstanding results. 

The Prime Minister said that many aspirational districts are affected by Naxal violence. He said the battle against Naxal violence is now in a decisive phase. He said violence will be dealt with firmly, even as development proceeds in a fast-paced and balanced manner. 

On the health sector, the Prime Minister said that several targets have to kept in mind, to be achieved by 2022. He also mentioned the target of eliminating TB by 2025. The Prime Minister urged those States who have not implemented PMJAY under Ayushman Bharat, so far, to come onboard this scheme at the earliest. He said health and wellness should be the focal point of every decision. 

The Prime Minister said that we are now moving towards a governance system characterized by Performance, Transparency and Delivery. He said proper implementation of schemes and decisions is vital. He called upon all members of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog to help create a government setup which works, and has the trust of the people.

                Your Excellency, President of Kyrgyz Republic and my friend Mr. Sooronbay Jeenbekov, 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
 
I express my gratitude to President Jeenbekov for extending a very warm welcome to me and my delegation. I congratulate Kyrgyzstan on the unprecedented achievements of almost last 30 years. The future of this country is bright because of its natural beauty, strong democracy and talented people. The friendship and love of Kyrgyz people towards the people of India is heart touching. During my last visit here and this time also I have felt just like home. 
 
Excellency,  
 
I congratulate you on the successful presidency of the SCO Summit. In your presidency, SCO has taken several steps to improve regional cooperation. Last month in New Delhi, you graced my swearing-in ceremony. I'm grateful to you. I am also happy that today I have the opportunity to review our bilateral relations with you. Both India and Kyrgyz Republic attach great importance to mutual relations. 
 
Friends,  
 
Today I had extensive discussions with President Jeenbekov on many issues. We both feel that there are immense potential for cooperation between us. Today, we have decided to take our bilateral relations to the level of strategic partnership. This will help us have long-term cooperation in every area of our partnership.  
 
Friends,  
 
As two ancient and glorious civilizations, we are naturally connected to each other. India and Central Asia have had deep historical and cultural links. India and Kyrgyz Republic are the land of epics. For example, the Mahabharata and Ramcharit Manas in India and Manas in Kyrgyz Republic. We both are democracies and are full of diversity. 
 
Our common sense of strengthening our ancient relations and peace gave us the motivation to further strengthen our relations. This has also expanded our diplomatic relations. On different areas of bilateral and multilateral issues, India and Kyrgyz Republic regularly consult each other closely. We hold the same views on many international topics. We have strong cooperation in United Nations and other international platforms. Our defense cooperation has increased in military training, joint warfare, field research and military technical areas. The two countries have decided to form a Joint Working Group on defense cooperation. There are immense possibilities of economic cooperation between us and both countries can take advantage of them. 
 
Friends,  
 
Today we had a bilateral investment treaty and the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). We have also agreed on a five-year road map in the field of trade and economic cooperation. Today President Jeenbekov and I have jointly inaugurated the India-Kyrgyz Business Forum to increase B2B cooperation. An Indian trade show named 'Namaskar Eurasia' will be organized in Bishkek this year. I call upon Indian companies to study the opportunities in Kyrgyz Republic in the field of construction, railways, hydro power, mining and other areas.  
 
Friends,  
 
To meet the development needs of the Kyrgyz Republic, today I'm happy to announce $ 200 million worth of concessional line of credit. I hope that this assistance will be helpful in introducing many India-Kyrgyz joint economic activities in Kyrgyz Republic. Better connectivity between India and the Kyrgyz Republic and large parts of Central Asia will lead to business, investment and people-to-people contacts between people of both the sides. 
 
Friends, 
 
India and the Kyrgyz Republic actively participated in the first India-Central Asia Dialogue at the level of foreign ministers held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan in January. We have also shared vision for prosperity, peace and stability in our shared area. Excellency, 
 
Today, terrorism is the biggest threat for democratic and diverse societies like India and Kyrgyzstan. We are united to find a solution to terrorism and fundamentalism. The sponsors of terrorism will have to be held accountable. This message that terrorism cannot be considered justified in any way needs to be given to the whole world.  
 
Friends, India-Kyrgyz Joint Textiles Exhibition has been inaugurated in Bishkek. Those who watched the exhibition enthusiastically may have been surprised with the similarity between India and Kyrgyz textile traditions. India and Kyrgyz Republic will also collaborate on issues such as mountain ecology, green tourism and conservation of Snow Leopard. People-to-people friendship between us and cultural intimacy is our biggest asset. I want it to be preserved. Several steps have also been taken for this. 
 
I am glad to announce that we have agreed to celebrate 2021 as the year of cultural and friendship between the Kyrgyz Republic and India. Once again I thank you Mr. President. On this occasion, I invite you to come to India. It would be great honor for us to welcome you in India.  
 
Thank you.

                His Excellency Mr. Jeenbekov, President of the Kyrgyz Republic,
Hon'ble Mr. AdilbekUulu Shumkarbek, Director, Investment Promotion Agency,
Shri Sandip Somani, President FICCI,
Distinguished participants from business, industry and academia from India and Kyrgyzstan

Organizing this business forum between the Indian and Kyrgyz business communities is a matter of great happiness. It is also important that the bilateral phase of my Bishkek visit is being started from this Business Forum. This is an indicator of our shared priorities. India and Kyrgyzstan have had close cultural and economic relations since ancient times. There are immense possibilities of increasing this historic partnership according to the modern times. President Jeenbekov and I would like to expand India-Kyrgyz relations in different areas. And we would especially like to strengthen them in the field of trade and investment. Mr. President gave his guidance to this forum and personally participated in it. I thank him for this.

Friends, 

Rapid changes are happening in the world economy. During such times, the economic growth and technological development of a big economy like India are the main factors of sustainability and hope in the world. India is a huge market. Our country's young talent and enthusiastic innovators will play an important role in achieving our goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy.

Friends, 

It is evident that presently our bilateral trade and economic partnership is much less than the capability. Therefore, this initiative of Business-Forum is being done at a very opportune time. In my opinion, there are three catalysts to promote trade and investment - appropriate environment, connectivity and business-to-business which means B2B exchanges. I would like to state that to create the right environment we have finalized the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. Also, we are actively negotiating on the Bilateral Investment Treaty. This will provide a strong base for investment. We have prepared a five-year roadmap to increase bilateral trade. Kyrgyz Republic is a member of Eurasian Economic Union. To increase trade we are also working on Preferential Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. 

Better connectivity plays an important role in facilitating trade. Chabahar port has emerged as a new form of connectivity between India and Afghanistan. We need to pay more attention to creating better connectivity between India and Central Asia. We have also taken several initiatives to increase B2B exchanges. This year, the ""Namaskar Eurasia"" trade show will be organized in Bishkek. Various products of India and the Kyrgyz Republic complement each other in the business. We should take advantage of all these opportunities. Kyrgyz organic products have a good reputation in the market. Honey from the mountains, walnut and dairy products from here are well-known for their ecological purity and natural-processing. In the same way, for the traders and investors of India, there are good opportunities in the Kyrgyz Republic in areas of medicine, textiles, railways, hydropower, mining and minerals, and tourism.

Friends, 

I wish that all your discussions are fruitful. I encourage Kyrgyz business leaders to work with the Indian entrepreneurs.

All of you are equally welcome in India. And the people of India, as soon as they land here on the airport, listening to Manas makes it feel that the people are quite intimate. When we hear this, it seems that we are attached to the old things of the world, such is the intimacy. If you pay a little attention to the language, then you will find that many words are similar and when you get such similarity, then intimacy is but natural. Both the sides should take advantage of this and may the contribution of business world in the development of both the countries also increase. With this one expectation, many congratulations to all of you.

Many-many thanks to all of you.

                Excellency, President of Kyrgyz Republic and the Chairman of today’s meeting,

Excellencies, colleagues and friends, 

First of all, I would like to congratulate President Jeenbekov and Kyrgyz Republic for the efficient leadership of the SCO Summit. I would also like to thank him for the generous hospitality and the grand welcome. It is a pleasure for me to take part in this meeting of the SCO leaders. It has been two years since India became a full member of the SCO. We have made positive contributions to all activities of the SCO. We have continued extensive engagement to increase the role and credibility of SCO in the international arena. 

Excellencies, 

The history, civilization and culture of India, have been interconnected with the SCO region for thousands of years. Our shared area needs better connectivity in the modern era. Initiatives like International North South Transport Corridor, Chabahar Port, Ashgabat Agreement, clearly emphasize the focus of India on connectivity. We have also operated Air Freight Corridor between Kabul and Kandahar and New Delhi and Mumbai since 2017. Respect for sovereignty, regional integrity, good governance, transparency, practicality and reliability should be the basis of connectivity initiatives. The importance of people-to-people contact is no less than physical connectivity. Our e-tourist visa services are available for most of the SCO countries. I am happy to announce that soon the website of Indian Tourism Department will have a 24X7 Tourist Helpline with Russian interfaces in Russian language for the ease of the tourists of the SCO countries.

Excellencies, 

A united, peaceful, safe and prosperous Afghanistan is an important factor for the stability and security in the SCO region. Our aim is to support the efforts of the government and the people of Afghanistan for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled inclusive peace process. We are happy that the roadmap for further action of the SCO Afghanistan contact group is ready.

Excellencies, 

Weshouldhave a vision to strengthen healthy co-operation in our region. The letters HEALTH can be a good template for our collaboration,

H for Healthcare Cooperation
E for Economic Cooperation
A for Alternate Energy
L for Literature and Culture
T for Terrorism free society
H for Humanitarian Cooperation
H for Healthcare cooperation

We should emphasize SCO's 2019-2021 work plan on Healthcare. India will be happy to share its experience in the field of tele-medicine and medical tourism.

E for Economic Cooperation

Economic cooperation is the foundation of our people's future. One-sidedness and protectionism have not done any good to anyone. We need a rule based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system focused on the World Trade Organization. This will protect the interests of all the members, and especially the developing countries. India is committed to working rapidly on making an SCO-member friendly environment for economic activities. Today we are going to sign key agreements, which will strengthen cooperation in financial matters, digitization and ICT in the SCO.

A for Alternate Energy

India's commitment to dealing with climate change lies in our philosophy which considers the earth as our mother. Today, India is the sixth largest producer of renewable energy and the fifth largest solar power producer. International Solar Alliance is a joint initiative of India. Its aim is to mobilize technology and finance to reduce solar energy costs. We welcome the countries of the SCO in this initiative. And are ready to share our experience in developing alternative sources of energy. Today we have agreed on the concept paper of cooperation in the year 2019-21 for environmental protection under SCO.

L for Literature and Culture

Introducing our youth to each other's literature will deepen our relations. 10 great creations of Indian literature will be translated into the language of the SCO countries. Recently, with the cooperation of Uzbekistan, an SCO Film Festival was successfully organized in Tashkent. It included entertaining Bollywood and Uzbek films. Literature and culture provide a positive activity to our societies. Especially this can prevent the spread of radicalization among the youth in our society.

T for Terrorism free society

During my visit to Sri Lanka last Sunday, I went to the St. Anthony's church. There I remembered the shameful face of terrorism, which would just crop up anytime anywhere and take lives of innocent people daily. To combat this menace, all humanist forces should get out of their narrow realms and get together.Countries responsible for aiding, supporting and providing financial assistance to terrorists should be held accountable. SCO members should also effectively explore the capacity of SCO-RATS to eliminate terrorism.India calls for an international conference to combat the scourge of terrorism. 

H for Humanitarian Cooperation

In the region India has been playing the role of First Responder in humanitarian cooperation and in disaster situations. We will be happy to share our experience and expertise with the SCO countries. We must pay special attention to the topic of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. 

Excellencies, 

[I welcome the Bishkek Declaration; a useful blueprint for collaboration] I once again thank our host His Excellency, President Jeenbekov. I would like to offer my wishes and congratulate President Vladimir Putin for heading the SCO next year and I assure full cooperation of India to the Russian Federation for the successful presidency of the SCO.

Thank you.

                I am visiting Bishkek (Kyrgyz Republic) on 13-14 June 2019 to attend the meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

We attach special importance to SCO in promoting multilateral, political, security, economic and people-to-people interaction in the region.

India has actively participated in various SCO dialogue mechanisms since its full membership of SCO two years ago. We have extended full cooperation to the Chairmanship of the Kyrgyz Republic over the past year.

The Summit is expected to discuss the global security situation, multilateral economic cooperation, people-to-people exchanges and topical issues of international and regional importance. On the sidelines of the Summit, I also plan to meet several leaders bilaterally.

On the invitation of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, I will also be on an official bilateral visit to the Kyrgyz Republic on 14 June 2019, after conclusion of the SCO Summit.

India and the Kyrgyz Republic, bound by historical and civilizational links, share traditionally warm and friendly relations. In recent times, our relations have expanded in several areas of bilateral engagement, including defence, security, trade and investment.

Apart from our discussions on the entire range of bilateral cooperation, President Jeenbekov and I will jointly address the first meeting of India-Kyrgyz Business Forum.

I am confident that my visit tothe Kyrgyz Republic will further strengthen and consolidate our cooperation with the SCO member countries and with the Kyrgyz Republic.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with all Secretaries to the Government of India, at LokKalyan Marg.

Union Ministers Shri Rajnath Singh, Shri Amit Shah, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman and Dr.Jitendra Singh, were present on the occasion.

Initiating the interaction, the Cabinet Secretary, Shri P.K. Sinha, recalled how the Prime Minister has interacted directly with all officers upto Director/Deputy Secretary level, in the previous tenure of the Government.

Looking forward, the Cabinet Secretary mentioned two important tasks which would be placed before Sectoral Groups of Secretaries: (a) A five year plan document for each Ministry, with well-defined targets and milestones. (b) A significant impactful decision in each Ministry, for which approvals will be taken within 100 days.

During the interaction, various Secretaries shared their vision and ideas on subjects such as administrative decision-making, agriculture, rural development and Panchayati Raj, IT initiatives, education reform, healthcare, industrial policy, economic growth, skill development etc.

During the interaction, the Prime Minister recalled his first such interaction with the Secretaries, in June 2014. He said the recent General Elections, have been marked by pro-incumbency, for which credit must go to the entire team of officials, which worked hard, conceived schemes, and delivered excellent results on the ground, over the last five years. He said the Elections this time have been marked by a positive vote, which emerges from trust that the common man feels, based on his day-to-day experiences.

The Prime Minister said that the Indian voter has outlined a vision for the next five years, and this is now an opportunity before us. He said that the huge expectations of the people should not be viewed as a challenge, but an opportunity. He said the mandate reflects the will and aspirations of the people to change the status quo, and seek a better life for themselves. 

Speaking of the demographic dividend, the Prime Minister said it is essential that the demographics be utilised efficiently. Every department of the Union Government, and every district of each State has a role to play in making India a 5 trillion dollar economy, he said. He touched upon the importance of the ""Make in India"" initiative, and the need to make tangible progress towards this end.

The Prime Minister said that India's progress in ""Ease of Doing Business"", should reflect in greater facilitation for small businesses and entrepreneurs. He said the each Ministry of the Government should focus on ""Ease of Living.""

The Prime Minister said water, fisheries, and animal husbandry, will also be important areas for the Government.

He said that during the interaction today, he has seen that Secretaries have vision, commitment and energy to take the country forward. He said he is proud of the team. He urged everyone to use technology to improve outcomes and efficiency in each department.

The Prime Minister said that all departments must seek to leverage the upcoming milestone of 75 years of independence, which can inspire people to make a contribution for the betterment of the country. He urged everyone to hit the ground running, to fulfil the aspirations of the people.

                Hon’ble Speaker of the People’s Majlis, former President of the Maldives and my dear friend Your Excellency, Mr.MohamadNasheed,
Hon’ble Members of the People‘s Majlis
Excellencies,
Distinguished Guests,
Namaskaar (Good Evening).

I convey to you the greetings and best wishes on behalf of 1.3 billion Indians, and on my own behalf. The joy and enthusiasm of the holy festival of Eid-ul-Fitr is still with us. I convey to you and all the people of the Maldives sincere greetings on this occasion also.

Hon’ble Speaker, 

The Maldives is a garland of over 1000 islands. It is a rare gem not only of the Indian Ocean region but the whole world. Its boundless beauty and natural treasure have been a centre of attraction for centuries. This country is a glowing example of the indomitable courage of man in the face of nature’s force. Maldives has been witness to the constant flow of trade, people and culture. And Male, this beautiful capital, is not merely a gateway for tourists to the blue oceans. It is also the key for the entire world to a stable, peaceful and prosperous Indian Ocean region. 

Hon’ble Speaker,

It is a matter of great happiness and honour for me to be with all of you today in the Maldives and in this august Majlis. I am privileged that the Majlis resolved unanimously to invite me in its very first meeting after the election of Hon’bleMr.Nasheed as the Speaker. This gesture of yours has touched the heart of every Indian and has enhanced their pride and honour. And for this, Hon’ble Speaker, I sincerely thank you and all the Hon’ble Members of this august House on my behalf and also on behalf of the whole of India.

Hon’ble Speaker

This is my second visit to the Maldives. And in a sense, it is also for the second time that I am witnessing the historical proceedings of the Majlis. I was very happy and greatly privileged to be present at the Inauguration Ceremony of President Solih last November. That occasion was celebrated, in an open stadium amidst thousands of people, a famous and historical victory of democracy whose faith, courage and resolve were the basis of that victory. That ceremony was an overwhelming experience. I felt first-hand the energy of true democracy in Maldives. That day, I witnessed the dedication and commitment of the common citizen of Maldives for democracy and also their love and regard for leaders like you, Mr. Speaker. And today, I salute all of you, the flag bearers of democracy in Maldives.

Hon’ble Speaker,

This House, this Majlis is not just a building constructed of bricks and mortar. It is no ordinary gathering of people. It is that energy centre of democracy where the pulse of the nation and its heart beat resonate in the thoughts and voice of each and every Member of this House. It is here that the dreams and aspirations of people come true through your efforts. It is here that Members belonging to various ideologies and parties converge to convert their collective will into lasting achievements for the sake of democracy, development and peace in the country. 

In just the same way, a few months ago, the Maldivian people collectively presented a glowing example of democracy to the whole world. That journey of yours was full of challenges. But Maldives showed, you all showed, that it is the people who ultimately win. It was no ordinary success. This achievement of yours is a great source of strength for democracy in the whole world. And who could be the happiest and the most proud of this achievement of the Maldives?

The answer is obvious. 
It is of course your closest friend and neighbour, and the largest democracy in the world, India.Today, in this august gathering, I would like to emphasise that India and all Indians have always been and always will be with you for the cause of strengthening democracy in the Maldives. 

Hon'ble Speaker,

In India too, we have recently completed the largest democratic exercise in the history of mankind. For 1.3 billion Indians, it was not just an ordinary election, but a celebration, a mega festival of democracy. Over two-thirds of eligible voters, that is more than 600 million people, turned up to vote. They gave an overwhelming mandate for development and stability.

Hon'ble Speaker,

The fundamental Mantra of my government ""SabkaSaath, SabkaVikasaurSabkaVishwas (together with all, for the development all and with the trust of all) is not merely for India. It is also the cornerstone of my government's foreign policy and approach in the larger world, especially in our neighbourhood. 

‘Neighbourhood First’ is our priority. And in the neighbourbood, Maldives is priority. And therefore, it is no coincidence that I stand amidst you today.

In December last year, India was the first country President Solih visited. And now, the affectionate invitation from Maldives has brought me here, making it my first overseas destination in this new term. And a short while ago, I was also fortunate and privileged that President Solih conferred on me Maldives’ highest civilian honour for foreigners. I am truly at a loss for words to convey my gratitude.

Hon'ble Speaker,

Relations between India and Maldives are older than history. From time immemorial, blue waters have washed our shores. The waves of the vast seas connecting us have been the messengers of friendship between our peoples. They have also nourished our cultures and civilisations. Our relationship has been blessed with the depth and expanse of oceans.Trade has flourished between Maldives and India, including my home state Gujarat for millennia. More than 2500 years ago, Maldives traded with Lothal, which is considered among the oldest ports in the world. Thereafter, trade continued with cities like Surat. Even Indian children have coveted the treasure of Maldivian cowries. Music, musical instruments, customs and traditions are vivid examples of our shared heritage.

Take for example Divehi language. ‘Week’ is called ‘hafta’ in India, and also in Divehi. Let’s look at the names of weekdays. ‘Sunday’ in Divehi is Aadittha, which is related to Aaditya or Sun. Monday is called Homa which bears similarity with ‘Soma’ or Moon.

‘Dhuniye’ in Divehi is the same as ‘Duniya’ in India, which stands for the world. And ‘Duniya’ is also a famous Maldivian name. And it is not just about this world. The similarity between our languages extends also to heaven and hell. The Divehi words 'suvuruge' and naraka are similar to ‘swarag’ and ‘narak’ in Hindi. 

A list of such similarities can be very long. If I continue, we will have an entire dictionary.

Suffice to say that at every step we realise that we are flowers of the same garden. And therefore, cooperation with you in preserving the cultural heritage of Maldives, preserving its manuscripts and developing dictionary of Divehi are of great importance to us. And it is also for this reason that I was very happy to announce today India's cooperation for the conservation of the historical Friday Mosque. A coral mosque like this exists nowhere else outside Maldives. Hundreds of years ago, wise Maldivians had created its unique architecture using wealth of the sea. This bears testimony to their respect for and harmony with nature.

Regretfully, the same marine wealth today faces threat from pollution. As such, the conservation of this magnificent coral mosque will also send a message to the entire world for the conservation of our environment.

Hon'ble Speaker,

India has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Maldives to support its freedom, democracy, prosperity and peace. Be it the incident of 1988, or fighting natural calamities such as the Tsunami of 2004 or the more recent water shortage. We are proud to have stood with you, supporting your efforts at all times and at every step. 

And now, the strong mandate in both our countries for development, prosperity and stability has opened new avenues for our cooperation. There has been encouraging progress in implementing the economic package of US $1.4 billion, which was agreed upon during the visit of President Solih to India. 

The unwavering focus of India's developmental cooperation with your great country is the social and economic development of the people of Maldives. Whether it is about water supply and sanitation on the islands, creating infrastructure and developing health and educational facilities: India's cooperation will always be focused on the welfare of the people and be based on the requirements and priorities of Maldives.

Dozens of our Social Impact and other cooperation projects touch the lives of the common people in this country and contribute to your efforts for the betterment of their lives. India will continue to be a reliable, strong and leading partner for democracy and prosperity in Maldives. And this cooperation will strengthen your hands as representatives of the Maldivian people.

Hon'ble Speaker,

Relations between two countries are not confined to their governments alone. They draw energy from strong ties between their peoples. Therefore, I attach special significance to all those efforts which promote people-to-people exchanges. Hence, I am particularly happy that today we have agreed to start a new ferry service between our countries. I am also very happy that the visa facilitation agreement concluded last year has made it easier for thousands of Maldivians coming to India for business, medical care, education, leisure, tourism, etc. 

Hon'ble Speaker,

While taking our mutual cooperation forward, we have also to be mindful of the vast uncertainties and serious challenges around us today. There are many emerging challenges from the disruptions caused by technological advancement, shifts in the axis of economic and strategic power in a multi-polar world, competition and rivalry. 

However, I would like to touch upon three such topics that are most important for both our countries.

Hon'ble Speaker,

Terrorism is a very big challenge of our times. This is not a challenge faced by one nation or region only. It is a challenge for all humankind. Not a day goes by when the horrific face of terrorism does not show itself, and takes an innocent life somewhere. Terrorists do not own banks. They don’t have their own mints, nor armament factories. But neither money nor weapons seem to be in short supply for them. Where do they get these from? Who provides them the facilities they need?

State sponsorship of terrorism is the biggest threat.

It is indeed extremely unfortunate that even now some people resort to the fallacy of distinguishing between the so-called ‘good’ and ‘bad’ terrorists. We have lost enough time debating these artificial differences. It is now no more tolerable. All forces supporting humanity must come together to effectively fight terrorism.

The litmus test for today’s leadership is the way they deal with the dark forces of terrorism and radicalisation. The international community has actively arranged for global Convention and many conferences on the grave threat of climate change. Why not on the issue of terrorism? 

I call upon all global institutions and all leading nations to organise a global conference on terrorism within a stipulated timeframe, so that there can be meaningful and result-oriented discussions for plugging the loopholes that terrorists and their supporters exploit. If we delay action any further, our current and future generations will never forgive us.

Hon’ble Speaker, 

I mentioned climate change. There is no doubt that it is a reality of our times. 

Drying rivers and uncertainty of weather adversely affect our agriculture and farmers. But, even more than that, melting glaciers and rising sea-levels have become an existential threat for countries like the Maldives. Marine pollution has wreaked havoc on livelihood dependent on coral islands and the Ocean. 

Hon’ble Speaker, 

Who can forget your radical and courageous step to hold the world’s first Cabinet Meeting in the depths of ocean for attracting the world’s attention to these dangers?

Maldives has taken several other exemplary initiatives also to promote sustainable development.

I am happy that it has joined the International Solar Alliance. The initiative to launch this Alliance, taken jointly by India, has provided a platform to several countries of the world for taking practical steps to save our Earth. Renewable energy is a potent alternative for mitigating many adverse effects of climate change.

This distinguished gathering is familiar with India’s ambitious target of 175 GW of renewable energy by the year 2022, and the progress achieved in attaining it surpassing all expectations.

And recently, India’s cooperation has lit up streets of Male with 2,500 energy-efficient and environment-friendly LED street lights. And over two hundred thousand LED bulbs have reached homes and shops in Maldives. They will help save precious electricity and environment, and also cut electricity bill.

India has paid special attention to the needs and concerns of small islands. We have not only come forward to address many of their specific difficulties but also raised our voice at various global fora, highlighting those difficulties and calling for their redressal. However, everyone needs to join in so that we can reach the requisite level of collective efforts. But we will be wrong to assume that merely technological solutions can help us fight the challenge of climate change. It will not be possible to adequately mitigate adverse effects of climate change without bringing in changes in our values, approach, life-style and societies. The ancient Indian belief regards the Earth as our mother and all of us as her children. If we regard this planet as our mother, we can only respect and conserve it, and cannot harm it. We should also remember that this home, our earth, is the legacy we hold for our future generations in trust, and it is not a property we own.

Hon’ble Speaker, 

The third subject is the Indo-Pacific, which is our shared region. It is a region with 50% of the world’s population, and enormous diversity of religions, culture, languages, history and political and economic systems. But it is also a region with many unanswered questions and unresolved disputes. Indo-Pacific region is an inalienable part of our existence. It has been our lifeline, and also the highway for trade and prosperity. In every sense, it is the key to our shared future. Therefore, I had said in June 2018 in Singapore that everyone will have to work together for ensuring openness, integration and balance in the Indo-Pacific. Only this will ensure trust among nations. Only this will ensure continuation of rule-based order and multilateralism.

Hon’ble Speaker, 

4 years ago, I articulated India’s vision and commitment for the Indian Ocean region in the form S.A.G.A.R, which is a word in Hindi meaning ‘sea’. This acronym stands for Security and Growth for All in the Region, which is a blueprint for us for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. 

Today, I would like to once again stress on this principle of inclusiveness. I would also like to reiterate that India will use its capabilities and strengths not only for her own prosperity and security.We will also endeavour to develop the capacity of other countries in the region, to reach out to them in the times of disasters with humanitarian assistance, and work for shared security, prosperity and a bright future for all. A capable, strong and prosperous India will be a robust pillar of peace, development and security not only in South Asia and Indo-Pacific, but in the entire world.

Hon’ble Speaker, 

We cannot have a more suitable partner than the Maldives in realising this vision and for cooperating to benefit from the Blue Economy. Because we are maritime neighbours. Because we are friends.And there is no one big or small, strong or weak among friends. The foundation of a peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood rests on trust, goodwill and cooperation. And this trust emanates from the faith that we would be sensitive to each other’s concerns and interests. So that both of us can enjoy more prosperity and more security. 

It is possible only when our mutual trust and confidence are strong not only in good times, but also during difficulties.

Hon’ble Speaker, 

""VasudhaivKutumbakam” is both our philosophy and policy. It means that the whole world is but one family. The greatest man of our age, Mahatma Gandhi had said ""There is no limit to extending our services to our neighbours”.India has always shared her achievements with the world and especially with her neighbours. Therefore, our development partnerships are to empower people, and not to weaken them. Nor to enhance their dependence on us. Nor indeed to impose the impossible burden of debt on the shoulders of generations yet to come. 

Hon’ble Speaker,

This is a time of complex transitions, full of challenges. However, challenges also bring opportunities. Today, Maldives and India have the opportunity:

● to set an ideal for the world of being good neighbours and friends;
● to usher prosperity through our cooperation so that the economic, social and political aspirations of our people are fulfilled;
● to work together for ensuring stability, peace and security in our region;
● to ensure the security of the world’s most important sea lane;
● to defeat terrorism;
● to keep the forces that nurture terrorism and extremism away from our shores; 
● to bring about necessary changes for a healthy and clean environment.

History and our people would expect us to make full use of these opportunities and not to let go of them. India is firmly resolved to cooperate fully in these efforts, and also to deepen its invaluable friendship with Maldives.I reiterate to you this solemn pledge today. 

I thank you once again for the privilege you accorded to me to be amongst you and the honour that you bestowed on me. I thank you for your friendship.

                Your Excellency, my friend President Solih,
Ladies & gentlemen,

I am glad that I have had the privilege of visiting your beautiful country Maldives in my first foreign visit of my second term. It is a matter of even greater happiness that I have got the opportunity to once again meet a close friend like you. On behalf of my team and myself, I thank you and the Maldives government with heartfelt gratitude for this opportunity and for your wonderful hospitality. Our countries have celebrated the festival of Eid just a few days ago with joy and glee. I wish that the light of this festival always shine on the lives of our citizens.

Excellency,

Today, by honoring me with the highest honor of the Maldives, you have not only honored me but the whole of India. The Honor of the Distinguished Rule of Izzudeen is a matter of joy and pride for me. It is not only an honor for me but also a respect for the friendship and close relations between the two countries. On behalf of all Indians, I accept it with great humility and gratitude. For thousands of years our two countries have been bound by the waves of the Indian Ocean in close historical and cultural ties. This unwavering friendship has also been a guide in difficult times. Whether it has been an external assault in 1988, or a natural disaster like a tsunami or the recent paucity of drinking water. India has always been standing with the Maldives and has always come forward for the help first.

Friends,

It is clear from the mandate of the parliamentary elections in India and the Presidential and Majlis elections in Maldives that people of both our countries want stability and development. As such our responsibility for people-centric and inclusive development and good governance becomes even more important.

I just had a very detailed and useful discussions with President Solih. We have reviewed our bilateral cooperation in detail with regional and global issues of mutual interest. We have full agreement on the future direction of our partnership.

President Solih, there has been radical change in the speed and direction of bilateral cooperation since you assumed the post. Decisions made during your visit to India in December 2018 are being implemented in a concerted and timely manner.

Friends,

Immediate financial requirements of the Maldives have been met with a $1.4 billion financial package announced during President Solih's visit to India. Along with this many new projects of Social Impact have been started. And new lines of development work have also been opened under the $800 million line of credit.

To further strengthen the development partnership between India and Maldives, we have focused on projects that benefit the common citizens of Maldives.

Today our bilateral cooperation is touching every aspect of normal life in Maldives.

● Water and sanitation arrangements on different islands;
● Sufficient finance for small and medium industries;
● Development of ports;
● Construction of conference and community centers;
● Construction of cricket stadium
● Emergency medical services;
● Ambulance service;
● Ensuring coastal safety;
● Arrangement of outdoor fitness equipment;
● Drug detox center;
● Student ferry;
● Agriculture and fisheries;
● Renewable energy and tourism;
 


Many such projects of Indian cooperation directly benefit the people of Maldives.

We have also agreed to assist in the development of infrastructure and conservation of the historic Friday Mosque in Addu. To increase the connectivity between the citizens of both the countries, we have also agreed to start a ferry service between Kulhudhuffushi and Male in Maldives and Kochi in India. With the release of Rupay card in Maldives, the number of Indian tourists will increase. Very soon we will take action on this. There has also been discussion on strengthening our defense cooperation. Today we jointly inaugurated the Composite Training Center of the Maldives Defense Forces and the Radar System of Coastal Surveillance. This will further enhance the maritime security of the Maldives. India accords utmost importance to its relations with the Maldives. We want a deep and strong partnership with each other. A prosperous, democratic and peaceful Maldives is beneficial for the whole region. I want to reiterate that India is always committed to every possible help to the Maldives. I once again thank His Highness, the President and the people of Maldives for their warm hospitality. May Indo-Maldives friendship be forever.

                I am visiting the Republic of Maldives and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka on 08-09 June 2019 at the invitation of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and President Maithripala Sirisena, respectively. This will be my first overseas visit after my re-election.

We had the pleasure of receiving President Solih in December last year. I also had the opportunity to attend the inauguration of President Solih in November 2018. My visit to the Maldives is reflective of the importance we both attach to our relationship as maritime neighbours and long-standing friends.

We regard the Maldives as a valued partner with whom we share deep bonds of history and culture. Our bilateral relations with the Maldives have been greatly strengthened in the recent past. I am confident that my visit will further deepen our multifaceted partnership.

My visit to Sri Lanka is to express our solidarity with the Government and the people of Sri Lanka in the wake of the terrible terrorist attacks there last Easter on 21 April 2019. India stands with Sri Lanka in the fight against terrorism.

Our bilateral relations with Sri Lanka have gained considerable momentum in the last few years. I had the pleasure of meeting President Sirisena during his recent visit to India to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new government. I look forward to meeting the Sri Lankan leadership during my visit.

I am confident that my visit to the Maldives and Sri Lanka will further strengthen our close and cordial ties with our maritime neighbours, in line with our ‘Neighbourhood-First Policy’ and the vision of Security and Growth for All in the Region.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved theratification of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI)

Impact: 

The Convention will modify India's treaties in order to curb revenue loss through treaty abuse and base erosion and profit shifting strategies by ensuring that profits are taxed where substantive economic activities generating the profits are carried out and where value is created.

Details:

i.      India has ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which was signed by the Hon'ble Finance Minister Sh. Arun Jaitley at Paris on 07/06/2017 on behalf of India.

ii.     The Multilateral Convention is an outcome of the OECD / G20 Project to tackle Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the ""BEPS Project"") i.e., tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity, resulting in little or no tax being paid. The BEPS Project identified 15 actions to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) in a comprehensive manner.

iii.    India was part of the Ad Hoc Group of more than 100 countries and jurisdictions from G20, OECD, BEPS associates and other interested countries, which worked on an equal footing on the finalization of the text of the Multilateral Convention, starting May 2015. The text of the Convention and the accompanying Explanatory Statement was adopted by the Ad hoc Group on 24 November 2016.

iv.     The Convention enables all signatories, inter alia, to meet treaty-related minimum standards that were agreed as part of the Final BEPS package, including the minimum standard for the prevention of treaty abuse under Action 6.

v.    The Convention will operate to modify tax treaties between two or more Parties to the Convention. It will not function in the same way as an amending protocol to a single existing treaty, which would directly amend the text of the Covered Tax Agreement. Instead, it will be applied alongside existing tax treaties, modifying their application in order to implement the BEPS measures.

vi.   The Convention will modify India's treaties in order to curb revenue loss through treaty abuse and base erosion and profit shifting strategies by ensuring that profits are taxed where substantive economic activities generating the profits are carried out and where value is created.

 

Background: 

The Convention is one of the outcomes of the OECD/G20 project, of which India is a member, to tackle base erosion and profit shifting. The Convention enables countries to implement the tax treaty related changes to achieve anti-abuse BEPS outcomes through the multilateral route without the need to bilaterally re-negotiate each such agreement which is burdensome and time consuming. It ensures consistency and certainty in the implementation of the BEPS Project in a multilateral context. Ratification of the Multilateral Convention will enable application of BEPS outcomes through modification of existing tax treaties of India in a swift manner. The Cabinet Note seeking ratification of the MLI was sent to the Cabinet on 16.04.2019 for consideration. Since the said Note for Cabinet could not be taken up in the Cabinet, due to urgency, the Hon'ble Prime Minister vide Cabinet Secretariat I.D. No. 216/1/2/2019-Cab dated 27.05,2019 has approved Ratification of MLI and India's Final Position under Rule 12 of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961 with a direction that ex-post facto approval of the Cabinet be obtained within a month. Consequent to approval under Rule 12, a separate request has already been sent to L&T Division, MEA for obtaining instrument of ratification from the Hon'ble President of India vide this office OM F.No. 500/71/2015-FTD-I/150 dated 31/05/2019.

                NDA Government led by the Prime Minister Modi is committed to all round development of the people from different walks of life. In keeping with this spirit and the need to have equitable distribution of benefit amongst the OBC Castes/Communities, a Commission was set up under article 340 of the Constitution to examine the issue of sub-categorization within Other Backward Classes in the Central list.

Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has accorded ex-post facto approval for the extension of the term of the Commission to examine the issue of Sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes, by two more months i.e. upto 31st July 2019.

          This is the sixth extension to the commission whose term would have expired on May 31, 2019.

Impact:

The extension of the tenure of the commission would enable it to evaluate the issue of Sub-categorization of OBC’s in the Central list based on wider consultations with various stakeholders. It will enable the commission to submit a comprehensive report on the issue. 

Background:

The Commission was constituted under article 340 of the Constitution with the approval of President on 2nd October, 2017. The Commission, headed by Justice (Retd.) Smt. G. Rohini commenced functioning in October, 2017 and has since interacted with all the Stats/UTs which have subcategorized OBCs, and the State Backward Classes Commissions. The Commission has come to the view that it would be appropriate to have a detailed consultation with the States/UTs in the light of the response received with respect to for the Consultation Papers issued by the ""Commission"" earlier. This is essential to ensure that no community is put in a grossly undeserving position and this process is likely to take a couple of months. 

In view of this fact, the Commission has sought extension of its term by two more months, i.e. upto 31st July 2019 which has been approved by the commission.

                In order to make the Dental Council of India more effective, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the introduction of a Bill to amend the Dentists Act, 1948 (16 of 1948). The decision also gives effect, with certain modifications, to the provisions of the Dentists Act, 1948 with regard to the membership of the Dental Council of India and membership of State and Joint State Dental Councils.

Impact: 

The amendment will help restructure the Dental Councils and the representation of Central Government members and elected members would no longer be made mandatory in the Dental Councils.

In the process it will reduce the redundancy.           

The Bill will be introduced in the upcoming session of Parliament

Details: 

To amend the following clauses of the Dentists Act, 1948:

(i)      Membership of the Dental Council of India under clause (f) of section 3 and

(ii)      Membership of State and Joint State Dental Councils under clause (b) of section 21 and clause (b) of section 23 of the said Act.

Background: 

The representation of dentists registered in Part B as Central Government nominees in the Dental Council of India and the election of four/ two members from Part B to the State / Joint State Dental Councils under the respective clauses in the Act have lost relevance. With a view to reducing the redundancy of the provisions of their representation, the Central Government has decided to delete these provisions so that their representation does not remain mandatory any more.

                In a crackdown on the unauthorisedoccupants of residential accommodations in public premises, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given a go ahead to introduce ""The Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Amendment Bill, 2019"".

Impact:

The amendments will facilitate smooth and speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from Government residences, and those vacant residences will be available for allotment to eligible persons on maturity of their turn in the waiting list. 

This will decrease the waiting time for availing the facility of residential accommodation.

Implications:

The new bill comes in place of ""The Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Amendment Bill, 2017"".

It will be introduced in the ensuing Session of Parliament. 

Implementation:

The Bill seeks amendments in Section 2, Section 3 and Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971, by inserting clause (fa) before clause (fb) in Section 2, a new section 3B below section 3A of Section 3 and a new sub-section 3A below sub-Section (3) under Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971. 

The proposed amendments would enable the Estate officer to apply summary proceedings for evicting unauthorised occupants from residential accommodations and to levy damage charges for accommodation held during the period of litigation. 

This Bill result in speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from Government residences and increased availability of residential accommodations for eligible persons.

Background:

The Government of India has to evict unauthorized occupants from Government accommodations under the provisions of PPE Act, 1971. However, the eviction proceedings take unusually long time, thereby reducing the availability of Government accommodations to new incumbents.

Under the existing PPE Act,1971 as amended by PPE Amendment Bill, 2015, the eviction proceeding take around 5 to 7 weeks’ time. However, it takes much longer, even years, to evict unauthorized occupants. Under the proposed bill, the state officer will not have to follow elaborate proceedings like serving notice, show cause, inquiry, rather he or she can initiate summary eviction proceedings.

The decision is yet another reflection of the Government’s commitment for a transparent and hassle-free governance for the citizens of the country.

                Reforms in the field of Medical education so as to give a push to the goal of a quality health coverage to the citizens of India has been one of the major pillars of the NDA Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Keeping the spirit alive and to fulfil yet another promise of the Government, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved theIndian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2019 to replace the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 through an Act of Parliament.  The Bill will be introduced in the ensuing session of the Parliament.

The move will ensure transparency, accountability and quality in the governance of medical education in the country.

Impact:


	The New Bill provides for supersession of MCI for a period of two years w.e.f. 26.09.2018.
	During this period, the Board of Governors shall exercise the powers and functions of MCI as assigned under the IMC Act, 1956. 
	The number of members in the Board of Governors will be increased from existing 7 to 12.


 

Background:

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had come across certain arbitrary action by MCI in disregard to the provisions of the IMC Act, 1956 and regulations made thereunder. Further, the Oversight Committee constituted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to oversee the functioning of MCI had also cited instances of non-compliance of their instructions and subsequently, all members of the Oversight Committee tendered their resignation.

 

In view of these developments, and to put an alternative mechanism in place of MCI so as to bring transparency, accountability and quality in the governance of medical education in the country, it was decided to supersede the MCI through the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 promulgated on 26.09.2018 and entrust its affairs to a Board of Governors (BoG) consisting of eminent doctors. The BoG was constituted under the Chairmanship of Dr. V.K. Paul, Member NITI Aayog and comprising six other members.

 

Legislative Process:

Subsequently, a replacement Bill of the said Ordinance namely, the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2018 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on the 14th December, 2018 and passed on 31st December, 2018 by the House. However, despite all efforts, during the winter session 2018 of Parliament the Bill could not be taken up for consideration and passing in the Rajya Sabha and the House has been adjourned sine die on Wednesday, the 9th January, 2019. Accordingly, it was decided to promulgate a fresh Ordinance namely the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 to allow the BoG appointed in supersession of MCI to continue to exercise the powers of MCI and that of Central Government so that the work already done by the Board of Governors as per the provisions of earlier Ordinance is validated and may continue.

 

The replacement Bill of the Ordinance i.e. the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2018 as passed by the Lok Sabha could not be taken up for consideration and passing in Rajya Sabha during the Budget Session - 2019 of the Parliament, the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 was promulgated on 21.02.2019.

 

The replacement Bill i.e. the Indian. Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2018 pending in the Parliament has lapsed on dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha. Accordingly, the Cabinet has approved the proposal to bring forward a fresh Bill i.e. the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the ensuing session of the Parliament to replace the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 through an Act of Parliament.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the draft Homoeopathy Central Council(Amendment) Bill, 2019.  

Impact:

The Bill seeks to extend the period for reconstitution of the Central Council from existing period of one year to two years so that the tenure of the Board of Governors may be extended for a further period of one year with effect from 17th May, 2019.

This will help the Central Council of Homoeopathy in exercising the powers and performing the functions of the Council.

Implementation:

The Bill will replace the Homoeopathy central council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 and extend the tenure of Government for another one year.

Background:

The affairs of the Central Homoeopathy Council have been entrusted to a Board of Governors consisting of eminent and qualified Homoeopathy Doctors and eminent administrators. Till such time the council is reconstituted. The tenure has been extended since the council could not be reconstituted within one year due to the non-updation of state registers of Homoeopathy and coincidence of general elections

                In a major move aimed at making Aadhaar making people friendly, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved “The Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2019” to replace the Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019. The amendments proposed are the same as those contained in the Ordinance promulgated by President on 2nd March, 2019.  The Bill will be introduced in ensuing session of Parliament.

The decision is expected to go a long way in meeting the people friendly and citizen centric nature of Aadhaar.

Impact:


	The decision would enable UIDAI to have a more robust mechanism to serve the public interest and restrain the misuse of Aadhar.  
	Subsequent to this amendment, no individual shall be compelled to provide proof of possession of Aadhaar number or undergo authentication for the purpose of establishing his identity unless it is so provided by a law made by Parliament.  
	For the convenience of general public in opening of bank accounts, the proposed amendments would allow the use of Aadhaar number for authentication on voluntary basis as acceptable KYC document under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.


Details:

The salient features of the amendments are as follows—


	Provides for voluntary use of Aadhaar number in physical or electronic form by authentication or offline verification with the consent of Aadhaar  number holder;
	Provides for use of twelve-digit Aadhaar number and its alternative virtual identity to conceal the actual Aadhaar number of an individual;
	Gives an option to children who are Aadhaar number holders to cancel their Aadhaar number on attaining the age of eighteen years;
	Permits the entities to perform authentication only when they are compliant with the standards of privacy and security specified by the Authority; and the authentication is permitted under any law made by Parliament or is prescribed to be in the interest of State by the Central Government;
	Allows the use of Aadhaar number for authentication on voluntary basis as acceptable KYC document under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002;
	Proposes deletion of section 57 of the Aadhaar Act relating to use of Aadhaar by private entities;
	Prevents denial of services for refusing to, or being unable to, undergo authentication;
	Provides for establishment of Unique Identification Authority of India Fund;
	Provides for civil penalties, its adjudication, appeal thereof in regard to violations of Aadhaar Act and provisions by entities in the Aadhaar ecosystem.


 

Background:

The Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 was considered by the Cabinet in its meeting held on 28th February, 2019 and the Ordinance was promulgated by the President on 2nd March, 2019.

The Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 amongst other things envisaged strengthening of the Aadhaar Act as per the directions of the Supreme Court and recommendations of Justice B.N.Srikrishna(Retd)  Committee.

                In keeping with its pro people initiatives and specially for those at the last mile of development, Union Cabinet under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has cleared the decks for approval of ""The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill, 2019"". The Bill will be introduced in both the Houses of Parliament in the forthcoming session of the Parliament.

The Cabinet decision is a reflection of Prime Minister Modi’s vision of a pro people Government committed to SabkaSaath, SabkaVikaas and Sabka Vishwas.

Benefits:

The move will go a long way in providing relief to the persons in Jammu and Kashmir living in areas adjoining international border.

They can now avail reservation in direct recruitment, promotion and admission in different professional courses.

Implications:

The Billwill replace “The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Ordinance,2019” by amendments in the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Act, 2004 and bringing persons residing in the areas adjoining International Border within the ambit of reservation at par with persons living in areas adjoining Actual Line of Control (ALoC).

Background:

The people living in Jammu and Kashmir areas adjoining international border were not included in the ambit of the Jammu and Kashmir reservation Act, 2004 and Rules, 2005. It provides for reservation in direct recruitment, promotions and admission in different professional courses to various categories including residents of Areas adjoining Actual Line of Control. Therefore, they were not getting these benefits for a long time.

Due to continuous cross border tensions, persons living alongside International Border suffer from socio-economic and educational backwardness. Shelling from across the border often compels these residents to move to safer places and is adversely impacting their education as Educational Institutions remain closed for long periods. 

Hence, it was felt justifiable to extend the reservation benefits to persons residing in the areas adjoining International Border on the similar lines of the persons living in areas adjoining Actual Line of Control (ALoC).

During the President's Rule the powers of the State Assembly vest with the Parliament and hence it has been decided to replace the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 with the Bill to be placed in both the Houses of Parliament.

                ‘SabkaSaath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’ has been the pivot of NDA government lead by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.  Fulfilling one of the promises to the people, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 by replacing the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Second Ordinance, 2019 (Ord.4 of 2019).

Impact:

The Bill would ensure gender equality and  gender justice to Muslim women. The Bill would also help in protecting the rights of married Muslim women and prevent divorce by practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by their husbands.  The Bill will be introduced in the forthcoming session of the Parliament.

Implications:


	The Bill propose to declare the practice of triple talaq as void and illegal. 
	It also makes an offence punishable with imprisonment up to three years and fine.
	It also provides for payment of subsistence allowance to married Muslim women and dependent children.
	The Bill also proposes to make the offence cognizable, if information relating to the commission of an offence is given to an officer in charge of a police station by the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced or by any person related to her by blood or marriage.  
	The offence is made compoundable with the permission of the Magistrate at the instance of the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced.  
	The Bill further provides for hearing the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced, before the accused is released on bail by the Magistrate.


The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 is on similar lines of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Second Ordinance, 2019.

                Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and Rules thereunder  encompass the provisions for prohibition of misleading advertisements and exaggerated claims of drugs and medicinal substances including AYUSH medicines and for the penalty to be imposed on the defaulters.  Central Government notified amendment of the Drugs & Cosmetics Rules, 1945 on 24th December, 2018 to insert Rule 170 specifically for controlling inappropriate advertisements of Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicines. Considering the emerging situation of misleading advertisements, Ministry of AYUSH signed MoU with Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) for two years to undertake monitoring of AYUSH-related advertisements in the print and television media and bring the cases of contravention of legal provisions to the notice of the State Regulatory Authorities for necessary action.  Similarly, Department of Consumers Affairs has set up an online system called GAMA ((Grievances Against Misleading Advertisements) portal for registering public complaints of misleading advertisements of various commodities including AYUSH medicines and allied products.   As a result of monitoring by ASCI,  732 cases of misleading advertisements of AYUSH were reported in 2017-18 and 497 cases in 2018-19.  Out of which 456 cases of violation of Drugs & Magic Remedies Act, 1954 in 2017-18 and 203 cases in 2018-19  have been escalated to the  State Regulators for taking necessary action in accordance with legal provisions. 

 

In order to check the veracity of misleading advertisements of AYUSH medicines,  State/UT Governments are empowered to enforce the legal provisions under Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940, Drugs & Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and rules there under.  State /UT authorities have been directed for appointing Gazetted Officers under section 8 (1) of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 to  enter, search any premises  or examine or seize any record which contravenes any provisions of the Act related to the alleged misleading or improper advertisements.  States/UTs are reported to have  appointed Gazetted Officers/Nodal Officers for this purpose and actions initiated against the cases of default.  Pharmacovigilance Centres for Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy Drugs set up in different parts of the country under the Central Scheme of Ministry of AYUSH are mandated to monitor and report misleading advertisements to the respective state authorities.  These pharmacovigilance centres have reported 1127 cases of misleading advertisements of AYUSH from August 2018 to March 2019.

                Ministry of AYUSH is taking various initiatives in promotion and integration of Indian AYUSH System with modern system to increase their acceptability as scientific and reliable alternative system of medicine. The highlights of such initiatives have been the following:-

Ministry of AYUSH under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM) co-locates AYUSH facilities at Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) and District Hospitals (DHs), thus enabling choice to the patients for different systems of medicine.

Ministry of AYUSH alongwith Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) is implementing NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke) for health promotion, prevention and management of Non-communicable diseases or Lifestyle related disorders through its three research organizations, namely, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM) and Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) in districts namely Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Surendranagar (Gujarat), Gaya (Bihar), Darjeeling (West Bengal), Krishna (Andhra Pradesh),  Sambalpur (Odisha) Nasik (Maharashtra) and Lakhimpur Kheri (UP).

It has been decided that 10% of the Sub- centres are to be upgraded as Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) under Ayushman Bharat which will be developed by the Ministry of AYUSH to provide comprehensive Health care to the needy community. The Ministry of AYUSH has to develop a total number of 12,500 HWCs in 3 years, out of which 4200 will be operationalized during current year.

CCRH has developed a public health program on ‘Homoeopathy for Healthy Child’ which has been integrated with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK).

Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS) conducts special OPD for non-communicable diseases and geriatric population. Many of the patients are on conventional treatment and with the help of Siddha intervention the HbA1c levels have been significantly reduced in diabetic patients and the quality of life of the patients has been improved. Nilavembu Kudineer a Siddha polyherbal formulation has been incorporated into integrative medicine strategy for the prevention and management of Dengue and Chikungunya.

Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY), an autonomous organization under Ministry of AYUSH has established 19 Preventive Health Care Units of Yoga in CGHS Wellness Centres in Delhi and NCR. Regular Yoga training programmes are being held in these Units. MDNIY has established 4 Yoga Therapy Centres in Delhi with the basic objective of mainstreaming Yoga in the existing health care system.  These Centres are providing Yoga consultation and imparts Yoga Training and Therapy to the aspirants/patients in the Hospitals.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the draft Homoeopathy Central Council(Amendment) Bill, 2019.  

Impact:

The Bill seeks to extend the period for reconstitution of the Central Council from existing period of one year to two years so that the tenure of the Board of Governors may be extended for a further period of one year with effect from 17th May, 2019.

This will help the Central Council of Homoeopathy in exercising the powers and performing the functions of the Council.

Implementation:

The Bill will replace the Homoeopathy central council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 and extend the tenure of Government for another one year.

Background:

The affairs of the Central Homoeopathy Council have been entrusted to a Board of Governors consisting of eminent and qualified Homoeopathy Doctors and eminent administrators. Till such time the council is reconstituted. The tenure has been extended since the council could not be reconstituted within one year due to the non-updation of state registers of Homoeopathy and coincidence of general elections

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will lead the main event of International Day of Yoga 2019 celebrations to be held at Prabhat Tara, Ranchi, Jharkhand on 21st June, 2019. Approximately 30,000 people are expected to participate in the main event. On 13th June, there will be a Curtain raiser to the main event at Ranchi, which will be attended by several State Dignitaries, besides the Yoga Organisations and Yoga Gurus.

Ministry of AYUSH is the nodal Ministry for observation of International Day of Yoga across the country. The ministry has successfully organized several programmes during the last four years in connection with IDY. This year also several small and big events are being planned on the occasion of IDY.  

Ministry has requested the stake-holding Ministries and Departments of the Central Government, State Governments and other related institutions to work in a coordinated manner to observe the International Day of Yoga (IDY) on 21st June 2019, in accordance with national priorities, in order to secure long term gains in the area of public health and well-being. Taking note of the immense and well-documented rewards of Yoga for holistic health and well-being of the population, most of the stake-holding Ministries and Departments, State Governments and other institutions have initiated activities to make the observation of IDY well participated event. Industry bodies like CII, FICCI, Institute of Company Secretary, as well as educational bodies like CBSE, NCERT, UGC, DAV etc. have already rolled out various programmes in preparation of IDY.

In addition to this, the Ministry is encouraging all individuals and institutions - including educational institutions, government bodies, business firms, industries and cultural organizations – to join IDY for the benefit of their employees, members or other stake-holders.

The thrust of the IDY observation on 21st June is on harmonious mass Yoga demonstrations, in which millions of people participate, at thousands of venues. To ensure that the Yoga demonstrations of such large groups take place in a harmonious fashion, some of the most accomplished yoga gurus of India came together and developed the Common Yoga Protocol (CYP). This is essentially a specified sequence of Yoga Asanas of 45 minutes’ duration. CYP has been designed keeping people of different age-groups and of varied walks of life in mind. It is also expected that those who get trained in CYP are likely to develop a taste and attitude for yoga, and hence may pursue it in the long term. Free video and e-book giving details of CYP are available for download from the Ministry of AYUSH website. The Ministry is also distributing these through various partnering organizations.

 

Preparatory activities for IDY 2019 undertaken by ministry of AYUSH:

 


	The Ministry initiated country-wide mobilization for taking up appropriate and specific activities for observation of IDY through a series of communications to identified stake-holding organisations from the Minister, Secretary (AYUSH) and other functionaries. Through these communications, the different Central Ministries and Departments, State Governments, Gram Pradhans (of about 2.5 lakh villages), Yoga institutions, Educational Institutions, Chambers of Commerce, Municipal Bodies etc. were addressed. All these stake-holding agencies were sensitized on IDY and were provided with suggested lists of activities, customized to the nature of the agency. Responses have been coming in, indicating that various preparatory activities are already taking place.
	The Ministry drew up a comprehensive media plan covering print, electronic and outdoor publicity options. 
	A series of review meetings were held to ensure that there is cohesion among all the activities organized by different agencies. These include the meeting of an Inter-Ministerial Committee on IDY chaired by Secretary (AYUSH) and separate meetings convened by the Ministry with Educational Institutions, Industry Organizations and other stake-holders.
	The count-down also incorporates a sustained campaign through social media platforms. The newly re-vamped and interactive IDY Portal of the Ministry is also being used to good effect to provide relevant and accurate information to the public. 
	Yogalocator – Mobile Application for uploading details of Yoga trainers, Centers and free events (with a disclaimer for information) and facility of navigation for public. 
	Bhuvan App-Mobile Application to report detail information of location, participants, organizer, instructor and volunteer of Yoga event celebrated on IDY 2019. 
	Initiatives with CSC -Broadcasting of video from 20,000 centers (target population- 40 lakhs) and sensitization of volunteers for use of Bhuvan app. 
	Yoga goes Green- This year Ministry is promoting usage of eco-friendly Yoga products. Since PVC and synthetic based accessories are hazardous and non perishable, the public needs to be sensitized and motivated to use eco-friendly products.


Prime Minister’s Yoga Awards

 

One of the highlights of IDY observation in India is the announcement of the Prime Minister’s Yoga Awards. The awards are being given away each year for exemplary contribution towards the development and promotion of Yoga. There are four awards to be given away in two categories:


	Prime Minister’s award for outstanding contribution towards promotion and development of Yoga at National Level (2 Nos), and 
	Prime Minister’s award for outstanding contribution towards promotion and development of Yoga at International Level (2 Nos)


The Ministry received about 200 nominations/ applications for the same this year, and these are being processed in accordance with the laid down procedure.

 

Delhi Events:  

 

In Delhi, the main event will be at Rajpath, New Delhi. This will be organized by New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) in association with Ministry of AYUSH. Apart from the main event, the programmes will be held at Red Fort, Nehru Park, Lodhi Garden, Talkatora Garden, Yamuna Sports Complex, Swarna Jayanti Park – Rohini and Dwarka Sector – 11.

                Currently a ‘Space Activities Bill’ is being processed, which is under pre-legislative consultations. India is a State Party to UN Treaties on Outer Space activities. The obligations under these treaties, such as international responsibility for national activities in outer space and liability for damages caused by its space activities and space objects are to be implemented through national/domestic legislations. The current Bill will enable the formulation of necessary Rules under the Space Activities Act, to deal with damages under the liability provisions and mode of securing financial guarantee for compensating the damages.

Consequent to enactment of Space Activities Act, space activities of non–governmental sector in India would be authorized through a licence issued by the Government on certain terms and conditions. It would address the liability issues arising from their space activities, in a suitable/ rational manner, at par with international practices.

                India’s own regional navigation satellite system named as “Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC)” is established by ISRO and is functional from April 2018 onwards.

ISRO has completed all the necessary preparations with regard to establishment of Space Segment (currently Eight IRNSS satellites are in orbit) and Ground Segment (spread across India). The Seven satellites in the system are providing Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) services and one satellite (IRNSS-1A) is providing messaging services. 

The potential of this indigenous system is being demonstrated in various application sectors viz. vehicle tracking system, mobiles, timing & power synchronization, fisheries, surveying etc. For example, all commercial vehicles registered from 1st April 2019 onwards are mandated to have vehicle trackers, which are also NavIC-enabled. More than 30 companies are manufacturing Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) or International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) approved NavIC-enabled vehicle trackers in India. Through the provision of these services, the dependence on the American-owned GPS could be obviated.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, DrJitendra Singh along with Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Dr K Sivan addressed a press conference here today onupcoming space missions of ISRO, with a specific focus on Chandrayaan 2.

In his opening remarks, DrJitendra Singh lauded the commitment and hard work of scientific community and highlighted the benefits of usage of space technology in improving the lives of common people. He said that Chandrayaan-I was instrumental in identifying water on the moon. Dr Singh said that under the direction of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, applications of space technology in areas such as infrastructure, disaster management and security have eased lives of common people and improved the delivery of Government’s welfare programmes. India has emerged as a world leader in space technology application today, he added.

On the forthcoming Gaganyaan Mission, Dr Singh said that by the 75th anniversary of Independence in 2022, India would be launching its first human space flight. He added that the Government has sanctioned Rs 10,000 crores for this Mission, which is being guided by the Gaganyaan National Advisory Councilthat has eminent scientists and persons as members.

Giving a presentation on the forthcoming Missions of ISRO, Dr Sivan gave details of Chandrayaan-2, Gaganyaan, Aditya L1 and a Mission to Venus.

Dr. Sivan said that the objectives of Chandrayaan-2 are:


	To map the variations in lunar surface composition extensively in order to trace back the origin and evolution of the moon.
	Focused studies on the extent of water molecule distributionon the surface, below the surface and in the tenuous lunar exosphere to address the origin of water on moon


The mission is planned to fly on a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III) with an approximate lift-off mass of 3,877 kg (8,547 lb) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island. The launch is scheduled for 15 July 2019. He said that the controlled landing of rover on the lunar surface is the most challenging task.The mission will include 8 orbiter payloads, 3 Vikram Lander payloads and 2 Pragyaan Rover Payloads. Chandrayaan-2 represents a national effort with 500 industries and 15 institutions combining to achieve the desired objectives.

On Gaganyaan, Dr Sivan informed that ISRO has signed an MoU with Indian Air Force for selection and training of the crew. ISRO is also actively engaged in building capacity for India’s sustained human space flight programs, with the first manned flight scheduled in or before 2022. This will be the Gaganyaan mission, in which selected astronauts will spend 3-7 days in the Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) of 120-400 km.

The ISRO Chairman spoke about the solar mission Aditya L1, scheduled for launch in 2020. This would aim to study Sun’s Corona and its impact on climatic changes.

A mission to Venus has been planned for a tentative launch in 2023, with the objective to study the atmosphere and surface topography of Venus. 

Dr Sivan said that ISRO is also planning to have its own Space station in the long term.

The briefing was followed by an interactive session with media.

Senior officers of Department of Space were also present on the occasion.

                India has adopted “closed fuel cycle”, where spent nuclear fuel is regarded as a material of resource. Closed fuel cycle aims at reprocessing of spent fuel for recovery of Uranium and Plutonium and recycling them back to reactor as fuel. This finally leads to a very small percentage of residual material present in spent nuclear fuel requiring their management as radioactive waste.

Safe management of radioactive waste has been accorded high priority right from the inception of our nuclear energy programme. High level radioactive waste also contains many useful isotopes like Caesium-137, Strontium-90, Ruthenium-106 etc. With the advent of new technologies based on partitioning of waste, emphasis is accorded to separation and recovery of these useful radio-isotopes so as to make use of the waste for various societal applications.

Initiatives/advancements w.r.t. partitioning of the waste have been implemented safely and successfully enabling recovery of useful radio- isotopes like Caesium-137, Strontium-90, Ruthenium-106 etc. and their deployment for societal applications. Utmost emphasis is given to waste volume minimization, effective containment and isolation of radio-activity followed by near zero discharge of radioactivity to the environment. As a waste management philosophy, no waste in any physical form is released / disposed to the environment unless the same is cleared, exempted or excluded from regulations. A comprehensive radioactive waste management is established taking into account the operational capability for the management of radioactive waste and an independent regulatory capability for its overview. The nuclear waste management practices are at par with international practices following the guidelines of International Atomic Energy Agency.

                Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has planned the use of large deposits of Thorium available in the country as a long-term option. A three-stage nuclear power programme has been chalked out to use Thorium as a viable and sustainable option, right at the inception of India’s nuclear power programme. The three stage nuclear power programme aims to multiply the domestically available fissile resource through the use of natural Uranium in Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors, followed by use of Plutonium obtained from the spent fuel of Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors in Fast Breeder Reactors. Large scale use of Thorium will subsequently follow making use of the Uranium-233 that will be bred in Reactors.  The utilisation of Thorium, as a practically inexhaustible energy source, has been contemplated during the third stage of the Indian Nuclear Programme.  As is the case with generation of electricity from Uranium, there will be no emission of green house gases from Thorium also and therefore, it will be a clean source of energy.

It is not possible to build a nuclear reactor using Thorium (Thorium-232) alone due to its physics characteristics. Thorium has to be converted to Uranium-233 in a reactor before it can be used as fuel.

Development of technologies pertaining to utilisation of thorium has been a part of ongoing activities in Department of Atomic Energy.  With sustained efforts over the years, India has gained experience in different areas of Thorium fuel cycle. Efforts are currently on to enlarge the present Thorium related R&D work and activities to a bigger scale and towards development of technologies for the third stage of our nuclear power programme. Safety has been accorded paramount importance in all Thorium technology development studies.

Commercial utilisation of Thorium, on a significant scale can begin only when abundant supplies of either Uranium-233 or Plutonium resources are available. Accordingly, the large scale introduction and utilization of Thorium in the programme has been contemplated after an adequate inventory of Plutonium becomes available from our Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs), comprising the second stage of Indian nuclear power programme. This will be after a few decades of large scale deployment of FBRs. In preparation for the utilisation of Thorium in Third Stage of India’s Nuclear Power Programme, efforts towards technology development and demonstration are made now so that a mature technology for Thorium utilisation is available in time.

                Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) set up in 1958, is the apex body regarding use of nuclear energy, it formulates policy of the Department of Atomic Energy in all matters concerning nuclear energy.

The targets for nuclear power generation are set on an annual basis, as a part of Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL)’s annual Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) considering planned biennial shutdowns (BSD) of units during the year, connections of new units to the grid if any, during the year etc. The generation target for the year 2018-19 was 36904 Million Units (MUs).

 

The actual generation in the year 2018-19 was 37813 MUs.

 

The Government has planned to increase the installed capacity base of nuclear power in the country for increased electricity production from nuclear power. The present installed nuclear power capacity of 6780 MW would reach 13480 MW by the year 2024-25 with the completion of projects under construction (including 500 MW Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), being implemented by Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Ltd. (BHAVINI). The Government has also accorded administrative approval and financial sanction for 12 nuclear power reactors aggregating a total capacity of 9000 MW, which are scheduled to be completed progressively by the year 2031. On their completion, the total nuclear power capacity would reach 22480 MW. More reactors based on both indigenous technologies and with foreign cooperation may be planned in the future.

It is further clarified that the vacancies for Bye-elections to all Houses, including the Rajya Sabha, are considered as separate vacancies and separate notifications are issued and separate poll is taken for each of the vacancies although the programme schedule for the bye-elections may be common.

Holding of separate elections has been upheld by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Civil W.P. No. 132 of 1994 (A.K. Walia Vs Union of India & Others) and W.P. No. 9357 of 2006 (Satya Pal Malik Vs Election Commission of India) by its decision dated 14.01.1994 & 20.01.2009 respectively.

A two-day National Conference of SVEEP Nodal Officers was organized by the Election Commission of India on June 10-11, 2019 at TERI Retreat in Gurugram to review the strategy and implementation of outreach programmes during Lok Sabha Election 2019 and to chalk out the blueprint for the next 5 years.



 

In the Closing Session on 11th June, while congratulating the SVEEP Nodal Officers from the 36 states/UTs for historic voter turnout, lowest ever gender gap in participation and systematic efforts for making elections accessible, Election Commissioner Shri Ashok Lavasa also exhorted the officers to introspect in true spirit on what else could have been done. He implored all to minutely identify the areas of concern and personally visit low turnout areas for better understanding of reason of low participation there. Flagging thegap in registration among the newly eligible 18-19 years old and the participation gap among the 32% of registered populace, Shri Lavasa said that Election Commission shall need to go beyond incremental progress and think of leap frogging for which substantive changes are perhaps needed in many aspect of election management. Shri Lavasa asked the Officers to reach out to people outside the election machinery to get new ideas that can be incorporated.

Earlier, Sr. Deputy Election Commissioner Shri Umesh Sinha appreciated the innovations taken up at the grassroot level by election officials. He said that officials should strive to achieve the efficiency where shorter time is taken to register an elector and for a registered elector to cast his or her vote making the entire process smoother and more convenient for the citizen. Shri Sinha also saidthat along withthe quantity, one needs to focus upon improving the quality of electoral participation.

SVEEP Nodal Officers from across the country gathered to share state experiences, challenges faced, good practices as well as case studies on Day 1. On the second day of the conference, theofficers deliberated upon6 topics viz.Critical Gaps, Accessible Elections, Youth & Gender, Electoral Literacy Clubs, Partnerships & Volunteering and use of Social Media, and chalked out strategy for the next Phase of SVEEP.A special session on Social Media was conducted in the morning on how to effectively engage with the voters on Twitter and Instagram.

All the points chalked out during the Conference shall be further worked upon to detail out the Phase IV of the SVEEP programme which shall cover the year 2020-2024.

                Election  Commission of India organised in New Delhi today a day-long conference of Chief Electoral Officers of all States/UTs. The Officers were invited to deliberate on learnings from the recently concluded General Elections to the Lok Sabha 2019. 

While lauding the performances of all the CEOs, Chief Election Commissioner Shri Sunil Arora noted that the recent Elections threw up a fair share of challenges for the Officers to strive to conduct free and fair elections. Taking note of diverse unexpected situations like that of Nizamabad unprecedented EVM arrangements, Odisha's challenge amidst inclement weather, etc., CEC complemented the officers of successfully managing the gigantic exercise. Sh Arora asked the State CEOs to particularly now focus on simplification of processes from voters' perspective. He noted that conducting Elections in a diverse country like India has its specific State wise challenges. He advised the CEOs to suggest ways to strengthen the CEO and DEO offices so as to be able to meet the ever evolving requirements. He asked them to focus on the implementation plan - in particular the action to be taken at various levels i.e. ERO, RO, CEO and ECI Secretariat.

The Commission has formed Nine working groups of CEOs and Commission Officers covering various facets of election process including Electoral Roll issues, Polling Stations management, MCC, Voting processes & Materials inventory, Capacity Building, IT applications, Expenditure Management, SVEEP and Media interface as also Electoral Reforms. All the groups will deliberate on the concerned subjects and will suggest feasible recommendations by August 2019. Individual CEOs would also be submitting their respective State experiences report also.

Addressing the group, Election Commissioner Shri Ashok Lavasa said while the ECI system has well documented and codified procedures for conducting the Elections, the Officers need to adapt technology in measuring up to expectations of the Voters in achieving ease of registration and facilitate participation particularly. He asked the CEOs to come up with short-term, medium term and long term doable administrative and legal recommendations needed for bettering the Electoral system.

Election Commissioner Shri Sushil Chandra highlighted the 2019 Election that saw many innovations as also challenges. Shri Chandra said a quantum jump and not just incremental jump is needed to see further improvements in the system. He emphasised that strides made in technology need to be harnessed to make voting not just an inclusive experience but a pleasurable experience. 

The Commission thanked and congratulated all CEOs, ECI officers, field election staff for successful conduct of GE 2019. It was mentioned that ECI shall provide all resources from IIIDEM for completion of this exercise by the Working Groups.

                Two categories of votes are counted to arrive at the final result of General Elections 2019, first is Votes polled in EVM by General voters from over 91.1 Crores electors at Polling Stations and second category is Postal Ballots returned from over18 Lakh Service voters and also from the polling personnel deployed for the poll duties, outside their Parliament Constituency in case of single elections and all polling personnel in case of simultaneous elections as was the case recently when besides the election to 17th Lok Sabha, the Assembly elections for four states namely Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim to Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha also went for poll.

The provisional voter turnout data is displayed as percentage figure on Election Commission of India (ECI) Web site and Voter Helpline Mobile App on the poll day as uploaded by the Returning Officer(RO)/Assistant Returning Officer (ARO) based on the approximate percentage turnout figures obtained from Sector magistrates who in-turn get it periodically over phone/ in person from about 10 Presiding officers. After scrutiny of documents by the RO, provisional number of General voters’ turnout is compiled and uploaded on the ECI website based on the Polling Station wise tentative voter turnout data reported by the Presiding Officers, with male/female voter breakup, added together to get the PC wise provisional voter turnout. All these figures are provisional, based on estimates which are subject to change as is made clear from the disclaimer on the website that ""the data is estimated and subject to change"". This provisional voter turnout data is made available by ROs on regular intervals, which is collated by Chief Electoral Officers and ECI on the web site for wider dissemination and to ensure transparency in information dissemination.

At the time of counting, postal ballots received up to 8 AM on Counting day are first pre-counted and valid Postal ballots are then taken up for after actual counting for both of the categories a. the Service voters and b. the polling personnel deployed for the poll duties. The Postal ballot count is added to the EVM General voters’ count to give the final votes polled in every PC and the votes secured candidate wise and the winning candidate is given return certificate in form 21E by the Returning Officers.

Based on both the EVM votes and Postal Ballots counted, the Returning Officer prepares Form 21E and Index Card in which the breakup of voter turnout, including tendered votes for the Constituency, is tallied to get the final voter turnout for each Constituency. Form 21E is the return of election as specified under rule 64 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, for which the sole authority is the Returning Officer concerned. Also, INDEX CARD in use since last over five decades, is prepared by the Returning officer to furnish the voting data (including postal ballot data), polled and counted, after the declaration of the Result, which becomes the final authenticated data for all purposes including analysis and research. For General Elections 2019, Commission has already directed all the Returning Officers on 26th March 2019 to send the INDEX CARDS within 15 days of the declaration of the Result.

In earlier elections, it used to take months to collect such authenticated election data from all the ROs. Even in 2014, it took between 2 to 3 months after the declaration of results to collect and collate such data in authenticated form. Due to the innovative IT initiatives taken by the Commission this time, the final data on votes counted has been made available within a few days of declaration of results. The reconciliation of voters’ data for all PCs have been completed in all states and the Index Forms of all 542 PCs are expected to reach ECI from Returning Officers shortly, which after compilation, shall be immediately be made Public by the Election Commission.

As made out clear in above paras, the provisional voter turnout data reported on ECI Website is only the tentative number of voters and not the final nos. therefore it is incorrect inference to find Ghost voters when there are none.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials met today with the representatives of the Trade and Industry in Karnataka.

 

The Commission observed that:

i)         Growth rate of GSDP (constant prices, 2011-12 series) of Karnataka has fluctuated widely from 2012-13 to 2018-19, compared to GDP (constant prices, 2011-12 series) of India. 

 

ii)        Share of tertiary sector in GSVA (current prices) of Karnataka is highest amongst all southern states. 

 

iii)       Main drivers of tertiary sector in the State are IT and ITeS. Karnataka is home to the 4th largest technology cluster in the world.

 

iv)       Bengaluru is known as the start-up capital of India and it is reported that nearly 30% of the start-ups in the country are from Bengaluru (as per state’s memorandum).

 

v)        In the Ease of Doing Business Rankings, Karnataka was ranked 8th, amongst all states, in 2017.

 

vi)       Manufacturing sector in the state majorly comprises automobile, aerospace, textile & garment, biotech, heavy engineering and agro industries.

 

Further, as informed by the Pr. AG Karnataka, in 2018-19, there was GST revenue shortfall of Rs. 12,407.75 crore as compared to the protected revenue, which is more than 23% shortfall. 

 

As per State’s Memorandum to the 15th Finance Commission, the initiatives undertaken by State Government to promote Investment include:

 


	Karnataka is first State in the country to roll out multi sector start up policy for 2015-2020 aiming towards a globally competitive start up eco system. The objective is to set-up 20,000 technology start-ups by 2020.


 


	Karnataka Udyog Mitra (KUM) is a single contact point for all investors who are looking at setting up enterprises/business in state. Its role is to facilitate investments to enable a smooth transition from the stage of receiving investment proposals to the eventual implementation of the project.     


 

The 15th Finance Commission observed:


	State needs to provide enhanced impetus to development of manufacturing sector, which, in turn, would calibrate its overdependence on IT / ITeS sector, thereby, reducing concentration risk to growth. 
	In general, districts of north Karnataka are relatively backward compared to south Karnataka. 


          

The Commission further noted all the concerns highlighted by the representatives of the Karnataka Trade and Industry and promised to address them in its recommendations to the Central Government.

The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials met today with the Shri H. D. Kumaraswamy, Chief Minister, Karnataka alongwith his Cabinet colleagues and senior State Government officials

          The Commission observed that:


	The State’s contribution to GDP of the country was 7.9% in 2018-19.
	In 2018-19, the share of primary, secondary & tertiary sector in GSVA (current prices) of the State was 11%, 21% & 68%, respectively.

	State’s share in inter-se devolution was 4.713 based on the recommendations of FC-XIV which is less than its share of 5.05% in total population of the country.


 

            On the State’s Fiscal parameters, the Commission noted that:

 


	Karnataka is first State in the country to have enacted FRBM Act.
	In 2014, State Government amended Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2002 to provide for, inter-alia, inclusion of Off Budget Borrowings that are to be repaid from the State Government's budget in ""Total Liabilities"" to provide true picture of sustainability of debt.
	The State has been maintaining revenue surplus since 2004-05 .
	Karnataka has witnessed third highest own tax revenue (OTR) to GSDP ratio of 7.2% in 2016-17 (after Chhattisgarh & Telangana) amongst all 29 States as compared to OTR-GSDP ratio of 6.3% for all States.




	In 2016-17, the State had incurred lowest committed expenditure (salary, pensions & interest payments) at 25.1% of total revenue expenditure as compared to that of 41.7% for all States.
	The State had fourth lowest debt to GSDP ratio of 18.3% in 2016-17 (after Chhattisgarh, Assam, and Maharashtra) amongst all 29 states.


 

Regarding the Health Outcomes of Karnataka, the Commission observed that the performance of State on most of the health indicators is better than all India’s average.  

            Karnataka has been able to achieve the target of AT&C losses as per UDAY MoU in each year from 2015-16 to 2017-18. In 2017-18, the AT&C losses of Discoms of the State were 14.48% against the target of 15%. Further, the State has been able to achieve targets of most of the UDAY barometers such as ACS-ARR gap, smart metering, feeder segregation etc.     

     The Commission expressed concern about the State’s GSDP - growth rate of GSDP (constant prices, 2011-12 series) of Karnataka has fluctuated widely from 2012-13 to 2018-19, compared to GDP (constant prices, 2011-12 series) of India.

The other fiscal parameters of concern were:


	As per the presentation made by Pr. AG, Karnataka, the buoyancy of non-tax revenue (NTR) of State has plummeted from 1.30 in 2015-16, 0.75 in 2017-18 to 0.38 in 2018-19(P).
	Off-budget borrowings of the State increased from Rs. 1,853.62 crore in 2011-12 to Rs. 13,173.44 crore in 2017-18. The off-budget borrowings as a percentage of outstanding debt of the State Govt. rose from 1.80% in 2011-12 to 5.65% in 2017-18.
	As per the presentation made by Pr. AG, Karnataka, in 2018-19, there was GST revenue shortfall of Rs. 12,407.75 crore for State as compared to the protected revenue, which is more than 23% shortfall.
	Since 2017-18, State Government has announced three crop loan waiver schemes, entailing estimated outgo of Rs. 47,419 crore. 


The Commission sought clarification from the State as  whether they have a long term financially sustainable strategy to overcome agricultural distress and promote agricultural development in the State.

The Commission noted all issues raised by the State Government and assured to address them in its final report to the Union Government.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh along with its Members and senior officials today met with the representatives of the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)  of Karnataka.

 

The Commission was informed that:

 


	All 17 functions of the 18 as envisaged in the 12th schedule of the Constitution, have been devolved to ULBs in Karnataka. One remaining function of Fire Services devoled only to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahangara Palike (BBMP).   
	The State has been releasing funds currently as per the recommendations of the 4th State Finance Commission ( 2018-19 to 2022-23).
	Karnataka  has a total of 280 ULBs, of which 115 are Town Municipal Councils, 92 are Town Panchayats, 58 are City Municipal Councils, 11 are Municipal Corporations  and 4 Notified Area Council.


 

As per the recommendations of the 4th SFC, (2018-19 to 2022-23)

 


	48% of the non-loan net own revenue (NLNORR) of the state to be allocated to local bodies. 
	1% of the NLNORR may be earmarked to Brihat Bengaluru Municipal Corporation, leaving 47% to be allocated to PRIs and ULBs in 75:25 ratio (i.e., share of PRIs & ULBs at 35% and 12%, respectively). 
	Central FC grants should not be included as a part of devolution.


 

   The Commission was informed about:

 

i)  AASTHI project for GIS-based property tax system: Under this project, the property tax valuation changed from annual rental value assessment to a capital value method and a GIS-based property tax information system was put in place. Further, a ‘self-assessment system’ has been implemented, shifting the responsibility for calculating property tax from city officials to property owners.  

ii) Karnataka Municipal Data Society (KMDS): State has formed Karnataka Municipal Data Society (KMDS) that rolls out municipal IT applications for citizen services and municipal administration to ULBs in Karnataka, manages their websites, and is a repository of municipal data.           

 

  The Commission observed that:

 


	There has been no releases of performance grants to ULBs in 2017-18 & 2018-19. 
	The State Government should have ideally constituted SFC-V by now – also the  that previous SFCs were not constituted on time.
	The State Government has included Central FC grants as part of state devolution (despite SFC-IV recommending against it).
	The revenue from advertisement tax for ULBs was estimated to be Rs. 200 crore in 2018-19. However, GST has subsumed this tax. In this regard, State Government has responded that ULBs were provided additional devolution of 0.5% p.a. of NLNORR by SFC-IV, which would take care of this shortfall. 


 

The representatives of  ULBs present at the meeting were – Ms. Gangambike Malikarjun, Mayor, BBMP; Shri Padmanabha Reddy, Corporator, BBMP ward No. 29, Leader of opposition in BBMP; Shri B. S. Sathyanarayan, Corporator, BBMP, Ward No.154, Basavanaudi; Ms. Roopashree B. S, Deputy Mayor, Tumakuru City Corporation; Shri Channabasappa S. N, Deputy Mayor, Shivamogga City Corporation; Shri B. A.

Raghavendra, Councilor and Member Standing Committee, Khudlagi TP.  

The Commission further noted all the concerns highlighted by the representatives of the ULBs and promised to address them in its recommendations to the Central Government.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials met today with the representatives of the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)  of Karnataka.

The Commission was informed that all 29 functions of PRIs as envisaged in the 11th schedule of the Constitution, have been devolved to PRIs in Karnataka and the State has been releasing funds currently as per the recommendations of the 4th State Finance Commission ( 2018-19 to 2022-23)

Karnataka has a total of 6228 PRIs, of which 30 are Zilla Parishads, 177 Taluk Panchayats and 6021 Gram Panchayats.

As per the recommendations of the 4th SFC,


	The  devolution to local bodies will be increased from 42% to 48% of the non-loan net own revenue (NLNORR) over the period of 2018-2019 to 2022-23.
	1% of the NLNORR may be earmarked to Brihat Bengaluru Municipal Corporation, leaving 47% to be allocated to PRIs and ULBs in 75:25 ratio (i.e., share of PRIs & ULBs at 35% and 12% respectively)
	Central FC grants not to be included as a part of  State devolution.


The 14th Finance Commission had recommended for the period 2015-20, a devolution of Rs. 8359.79 crores to Karnataka as Basic Grant ( 4.64 per cent of total grants) and a devolution of Rs. 928.87 crores  as Performance grant ( 4.64 per cent of total grants).

The Commission has observed that:


	There has been a minor shortfall in the release of basic and performance grants to PRIs in each year from 2015-16 to 2018-19, and 2016-17 to 2017-18, respectively. No performance grants were released to PRIs in 2018-19.


 


	The SFCs have not been constituted in a timely manner – the 4th SFC should have ideally been constituted by now.


 


	Despite the recommendations of the 4th SFC, the state Government has included Central FC grants part of state devolution.


 


	The 15th FC would have to take a call on whether it would recommend grants only for Gram Panchyats out of 3 tiers of PRIs in the State - in view of the fact the 14th Finance Commission had recommended grants for only Gram Panchayats.


The representatives of PRIs present at the meeting were -  Shri. C. Narayanaswamy, Member, Panchayat Raj Parishat; Sh. V.Y. Ghorpade, Vice-Chairman, Karnataka State Decentralised Planning & Development Committee; Sh. Manjunath, President, Chikkaballapura Zilla Panchayat; Ms. Jayamma, President, Bengaluru Rural Zilla Panchayat; Shri Neelakantappa. M. Kusagura, President Ranibennuru Taluk Panchayat;

Ms. Pushpa Rajesh, President, Somavarapete Taluk Panchayat; Shri Satish K. S., Member, Kadaba, Grama Panchayat, Gubbi taluk & President, Karnataka State Grama Panchayat Member Federation;  Shri P.P. Bopanna, President, Palibetta Grama Panchayat Virajapete Taluk and Shri Mahesh Kumar S.K., President, Doddajala Grama Panchayat, Bengaluru (North).

The Commission further noted all the concerns highlighted by the representatives of the PRIs and promised to address them in its recommendations to the Central Government.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by its Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh as part of  its visit to the State of Meghalaya today held a meeting with the representatives of the Trade and Industry Bodies of  Meghalaya.        

 

The  Commission was noted that:

 


	The  Meghalaya Government had launched ‘Industrial Policy-2012’, which promises to provide a package of subsidies, incentives and assistance to Micro, Small, Medium, Large, Mega Large and Ultra Large manufacturing and service enterprises; incentivize enterprises promoted and managed by “Woman Entrepreneur”/physically challenged with  additional 10 % (ten percent)  on the State Capital Investment Subsidy; incentivize industries coming up in backward areas will get an additional   15 % on the State Capital Investment Subsidy etc.


 

The Commission observed:

 


	Like the other seven states of the north-east, Meghalaya also faces the disadvantages of remoteness from the mainland of the country. It has to promote not only internal trade with other states of the north-east and the country as a whole — but also external trade with neighboring countries, such as Bangladesh.


 


	Meghalaya needs to strengthen up its infrastructure to attract foreign investment in the State. Good transportation networks are necessary to interlink potential growth centres, promote tourism, connect to border trade points, and support economic, social, and security needs.


 


	Meghalaya needs to take full advantage of the various central government funded schemes like ASIDE (Assistance to States for Development of Export Infrastructure), EDF-NER (Export Development Fund for North East Region), etc., to increase exports with Bangladesh.


 

The Commission assured to look into all the issues raised by the Trade and Industry representatives while making its recommendations.

	As ULBs are not constituted under 74th constitutional amendment, the State is not bound to follow certain provisions of the Amendment, for example, (i) hold direct municipal elections (ii) constitute ward committees, (iii) reserve seats for schedule castes, schedule tribes and women, (iv) continue municipalities for a period of five years, and (v) constitute state finance commission, state election commission and district planning committees.


 


	There are six Municipal Boards  in Meghalaya but the elections are not being held regularly in Municipal Boards.


 

Regarding the Revenue Sources of ULBs, the Commission noted that:

 


	The Meghalaya Municipal Act 1973 empowers the Municipal Boards to mobilise resources through the levy of taxes as well as non-tax sources.
	The tax sources include levy of tax on holdings situated within the municipality; water tax; light tax; latrine tax; drainage tax; tax on private markets and tolls on bridges. 


 


	The non-tax sources include license fees on carts, carriages and animals used for riding, or burden; fee on the registration of dogs and cattle; license fee on boats; betterment fee; fees for setting up and maintenance of fire brigade; fees for conducting at the cost of Board, any scheme of social service for the improvement of public health; fee on boats mooring within the municipality; and penalties for various offences. 


 


	Their own resources are reported to be insufficient to carry any development work.


 

The Commission had detailed discussion with the representatives and assured to look into the issues raised by them while making their recommendations on Meghalaya.

Share of royalty in respect of other major and minor minerals is in the ratio of 60:40 between the District Councils and the State Government.

· The revenue collected is barely sufficient to carry out their day to day administrative activities and primary duties as envisaged in the sixth schedule leaving virtually no funds for development work. (State Memorandum)

· The Fourteenth Finance Commission did not make award for ADCs stating that provisions of Part IX and IXA of the Constitution do not apply to the State of Meghalaya.

· SFC has never been constituted in Meghalaya.

The Commission assured to look into all these matters before making its final recommendations.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh held detailed meeting with the Meghalaya Government headed by the Chief Minister, Conrad Kongkal Sangma today.

 

          Some of the main issues discussed includes –

 


	Own tax revenue- Own-tax revenue of Meghalaya as % of GSDP is 4.38% in 2016-17 (average for North-East & hill states is 5.02%). Dependence on Union Government is high. Meghalaya gets 80% of its Total revenue receipts (TRR) comes from Union.
	Debt:  Meghalaya had Debt/GSDP ratio of 33.19% in 2016-17 and 31.76% in 2017-18. This is much higher than the FRBM target of 20%. This is also higher than the average debt of other North-East and Hill States i.e. 29.32% in 2016-17.
	NGT’s ban on mining of coal in Meghalaya: In 2014, a ban was imposed on coal mining in the State by NGT. This had an impact on GSDP and revenues of the State:


 


	As Mining has huge forward and backward linkages with other economic activities, the real GSDP of the State declined in 2014-15 by 2.1%. 


 


	This had an impact on the employment in the State. An increase in crime rate was also observed.
	A loss of Rs 255 crores is seen in year 2014-15 which is mainly on account of ban on coal mining. The State Govt. has estimated a total annual revenue loss of Rs 600 crores as a fall was seen in OTR (sales tax, excise etc) as well. This is due to significant forward and backward linkages. (Source: State Memorandum). However, with the introduction of GST and general improvement in the economy the taxation revenue of the State has since improved slowly.


 


	Cash deposit ratio: Cash-Deposit ratio in Meghalaya has been only 35-40%  over last 10 years while that of the country is 60%.


 


	Health indicators: Some of the health indicators of Meghalaya are below the national average like stunting among children, anaemia among women and IMR. The details of some of the health indicators are given in the table below:


 


	Poor road infrastructure:


The total density of roads in Meghalaya is only 401 km/1000 square km. However, the average density of roads in India is 952.8. 

 


	SDG rank: Meghalaya ranks 22nd  on all SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). The composite SDG index of Meghalaya is calculated by Niti Aayog to be 52 which is lower than India’s composite index of 56. Assam is the only North-East and Hill State which is ranked below Meghalaya.


 


	Fiscal  health of PSUs including Power sector: 


Out of 15 SPSUs in the state, only one SPSU (Forest Development Corporation Meghalaya Limited) witnessed accumulated account of profit at the end of year 2016-17. This distress is aggravated by the power sector SPSUs in the state. The power sector SPSUs bear an accumulated loss of Rs1836 crores, which is 6.5 percent of GSDP. However, six SPSUs including one power sector SPSU have shown account of profit in the year 2016-17 which comes as the only positive indicator from SPSUs. This dismal performance of SPSUs brings medium term fiscal risks for the state of Meghalaya. 

 


	AT&C losses: AT &C Losses of power sector in Meghalaya are 34.64% (2017-18) against target of 27.50% (Source: M/o Power)


 

Some of the  major requests of the State are:


	Vertical devolution may be enhanced from 42% to 48%. 30% out of the 48 % should be exclusively earmarked for special category states in order to insulate them from the volatility of the union revenue and economy of the country that can have an impact on its revenue collection.


 


	Meghalaya has projected a pre-devolution deficit of its State to be Rs 62,870 crores for the award period of FC-XV.


The Commission further had discussions on the matters of the impact of the implementation of the 5th Pay Commission, the debt liabilities due to the impact of UDAY.  Discussions also included impact of the State of Meghalaya hosting the 39th National Games in 2022 as it celebrates the Golden Jubilee of its Statehood on that year. This will be a challenging task involving building up of infrastructure and mobilizing of sufficient resources to fund the projects and activities, it was felt.

Summing up the intensive interaction with the State Government, the Chairman spoke on the macro-economic challenges of the State, stressing on the requirement of fiscal and debt consolidation.  He expressed concern on the State’s nominal GSDP trend growth which is much lower than the country’s.  The Chairman spoke on the need for a focused and aggressive strategy for attracting  private investment in the tourism and allied sector.  He also called for emphasis and priority on development of renewable energy – given the natural advantages of the State.  The Commission promised to look into all the State’s requests to the Commission specially those that would have growth multiplier effect.

Last evening the Commission had held a meeting with the representatives of all political parties of the State.  Without difference all party representatives highlighted the issues of infrastructure, problems being faced by the State,  specially in the areas of road congestion in the city of Shillong, lack of schools and hospitals, availability of trained teachers and doctors in rural areas, lack of access to border trade and other significant issues.  The party representatives belong to the following parties –


	Peoples Democratic Party
	Nationalist Congress Party 
	Meghalaya Pradesh Congress Committee
	National Peoples Party, Meghalaya
	Bharatiya Janata Party
	Hill State People's Democratic Party   
	Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement

                Government announces Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for 22 mandated crops and fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. 

Government had increased MSPs for all mandated crops with a return of at least 50 percent over all India weighted average cost of production for the season 2018-19. MSP for kharif crops for 2019-20 season is to be announced shortly. 

 The NITI Aayog has conducted a study entitled “Efficacy of minimum support prices on farmers”. The study covered 14 States, 36 Districts, 72 Blocks, 144 Villages and 1440 Households. The study is based on both the primary and secondary data. The study reference period was from the year 2007-08 to 2010-11. The study has found that MSP declared by the Government has encouraged 78 % of the farmers covered under the study for adopting improved methods of farming such as high yielding varieties of seeds, organic manure, chemical fertilizer, pesticides and improved methods of harvesting etc. due to remunerative price.  

Ground water levels in various parts of the country including North India are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.

Government has taken several steps, which among others, include (i) Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) in original green revolution states viz. Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh as a sub scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) since 2013-14 to divert the area of water guzzling paddy crop to alternate crops like pulses, oilseeds, coarse/nutri-cereals,  cotton and agro forestry. The following objectives are expected to be achieved through the implementation of CDP in original green revolution states:


	To demonstrate and promote improved production technologies of alternate crops for diversion of paddy cultivation.
	To restore soil fertility through cultivation of leguminous crops that generate heavy biomass and consume lesser nutrients. 


Presently, the programme is being implemented in the districts having more than 50,000 hectare paddy area to give more emphasis to divert paddy area.

Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all sarpanchs regarding the importance of water conservation and harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement.

The National Water Policy (2012) advocates conservation, promotion and protection of water and highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through rain water harvesting, direct use of rainfall and other management measures. The Policy has been forwarded to all States/UTs concerned as well as Ministries/Departments of Central Government for adoption.

The Government has circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for regulation of its development, which includes provision of rain water harvesting. So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model Bill.

Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3 (3) of the “Environment (Protection) Act, 1986” for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country. A nationwide programme of “National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM)” for mapping of aquifers (Water bearing formations), their characterization and development of aquifer management plans to facilitate sustainable development of ground water resources has been rolled out. 

Implementing of innovative schemes for Aquifer Rejuvenation under ‘Ground Water Management and Regulation’ scheme in select overexploited blocks of the Aspirational districts on pilot basis. Further, a joint Action Plan has been prepared with the Ministry of Rural development for effective implementation of water conservation and artificial recharge structures in convergence with MGNREGS. 

Artificial Recharge and Rain Water Harvesting are being implemented under various Schemes of Government i.e. Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) and Command Area Development & Water Management (CAD&WM) Programme etc.

This Information was given by the Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Rajya Sabha today.

                There is no specific scheme of the Government to promote organized farming.  However, the Government is promoting contract farming and formation of Farmer Producer Organization (FPOs) in order to promote farming in organized manner.

The Government of India, through Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), has been promoting formation of FPOs with technical handholding and financial support to leverage the collectivization from pre-production to post-harvest marketing.

The Government has formulated and released the progressive and facilitative Model Act “The ---State /UT Agricultural Produce & Livestock Contract farming and Services (Promotion & facilitation ) Act, 2018” in May, 2018 for its adoption by the States/Union Territories (UTs).  The aforesaid Model Contract Farming Act provides that Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) may enter into agreement with the contract farming sponsor to draw all the benefits of contract farming all long the agri-food value chain.  Self Help Groups (SHGs) as part of FPOs can avail the benefits.

This Information was given by the Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Rajya Sabha today.

                Green Revolution made the country self-reliant in foodgrain production. Post Green Revolution, there is increase in the use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation water to meet the nutrients and water demand respectively, of high yielding varieties (HYVs) of crops. However, due to imbalanced use of fertilizers coupled with decrease  in use of organic manure and over exploitation of ground water, there is deterioration of natural resources.

In order to meet the foodgrains requirement of the growing population of the country, the Government of India is laying emphasis on development of resource rich eastern region of the country for enhancing agricultural production. This would also help in reducing the over exploitation of natural resources in north western region, the traditional food bowl of the country. Considering potentiality of increasing production and productivity of foodgrains in eastern states, “Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI)”- a sub scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) is being implemented since 2010-11 in seven (7) eastern states of the country namely Assam, Bihar, Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. After implementation of the programme, the production of rice has increased in seven eastern states from 45.65 million tonnes during 2009-10 to 57.18 million tonnes during 2017-18.      

Besides, the Schemes/Missions namely, National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Material (SMSP), Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation (SMAM) etc. under the Umbrella scheme, “Green Revolution– Krishonnati Yojana” are also continued beyond 12th Five Year Plan for the periods from 2017-18 to 2019-20.  These schemes are for the development of the agriculture and allied sector in a holistic and scientific manner to increase the income of farmers by enhancing production, productivity and better returns on produce.

                As per Second India Meteorological Department (IMD) Long Range Forecast, released on 31.05.2019, rainfall over the country as a whole for the 2019 South-West Monsoon Season (June to September) is likely to be normal (96% to 104% of the Long Period Average). Region-wise, the seasonal rainfall is likely to be 94% of LPA over North-West India, 100% of LPA over Central India, 97% of Long Period Average (LPA) over South Peninsula and 91% of LPA over North-East India. 

Based on the first stage forecast of India Meteorological Department (IMD) for South-West Monsoon, a detailed advisory has been issued to all States/UTs on 25th April, 2019, for reviewing the States’ preparedness in managing any weather related contingency for mitigating the adverse impacts of an aberrant monsoon. The State Governments have been advised to update/fine-tune the District Agriculture Contingency Plans; to tie-up the availability of seeds and other inputs for implementing the Contingency Plans; to select suitable crops and cultivars   for promoting   less water   consuming    crops;    to promote    agronomic practices for 

conservation of moisture; to make necessary arrangements for life saving irrigation;  to restore irrigation infrastructure; to make use of technological interventions towards water conservation; to extend support to farmers in the form of inputs, credit & extension and to sensitize field functionaries of State Agriculture Departments for effective implementation of contingency measures. Progress of Monsoon and Area coverage etc. are monitored weekly through Weather Watch Group meetings as well as video conferencing, advising the States to take steps according to the prevailing situation. District Agriculture Contingency Plans for 648 districts have been prepared by Central Research Institute for Dry land Agriculture (CRIDA) to mitigate the situation in drought affected areas. There is a provision of distribution of seeds of contingency crops such as pulses, millets, oilseeds, which are drought hardy and survive with minimal available water in rain fed/ drought affected areas under National Food Security Mission (NFSM). States also have been made aware about the latest know how/ technology during National Conference on Kharif – 2019 (25-26 April, 2019). Agriculture is a State subject. Government of India supports and facilitates the State Governments through many Centrally Sponsored and Central Sector Schemes to promote agriculture in the country to boost farmer’s income through various schemes.  There is no such report from any State Government during the current Kharif 2019 season.

                 The State Government is primarily responsible for providing necessary relief measures in the wake of natural calamities. For undertaking relief measures, funds are available with the State Government in the form of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for natural calamities of severe nature and is approved on the basis of Memorandum received from the State Government, in accordance with established procedures.  

 

       The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare is concerned with providing relief under NDRF to farmers who have lost their crops due to drought, hailstorm, pest attack and cold wave/frost. An amount of Rs.15823.36 crore has been approved from NDRF during 2016-17 to 2018-19 to the States affected by the above said calamities (Annexure –I).

 

The Government of India has evolved several schemes/programmes to address the need for drought mitigation and other requirements of the farmers under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), besides implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and National Agriculture Market Scheme (e-NAM), etc. for protecting farmers’ interests. The States have been given flexibility under RKVY to plan region specific interventions for the farmers.

        

Agriculture is a state subject. The State Governments are responsible for disbursement of funds to the affected farmers.  All individual beneficiary-oriented assistance is mandatorily/necessarily disbursed through the bank account of the beneficiary.  In order to improve the disbursement and transparency in providing relief to the beneficiaries under various items, the State Government has to prepare a consolidated list of individual beneficiaries in whose bank accounts, funds have been transferred.  The list so prepared should be displayed on their website as well as the State/District and block/taluk levels for the purpose of verification and social audit.

                The Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of a pesticide registered for a particular agriculture commodity is fixed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The range of MRLs may vary both   pesticide-wise and commodities-wise.

For example, MRL of Thiamethoxam for Brinjal is 0.3 mg/kg and for Okra is 0.5 mg/kg whereas MRL of Pyriproxyfen for Brinjal is 0.02 mg/kg and for Okra is 0.03 mg/kg.

The Central Government has enacted the Insecticides Act, 1968 to regulate the import, manufacture, sale, transport, distribution and use of insecticides The Registration Committee, constituted under Section 5 of the Insecticides Act, 1968 registers pesticides after considering data on different parameters such as chemistry, bio-efficacy, toxicity, packaging and processing to ensure efficacy and safety to human beings, animals and environment. In additions, technical reviews are carried out from time to time to assess the safety of pesticides for their continued use.Further the monitoring of quality of pesticides is a shared responsibility between the Central and State Governments. Central Government and State Governments have notified   Insecticides Inspectors to check sale of misbranded pesticides. Insecticide samples are drawn on regular basis and analyzed in State Pesticides Testing Laboratories (SPTLs) and at the two Regional Pesticides Testing Laboratories at Chandigarh and Kanpur. Action is initiated under the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968 against those samples which are found misbranded. 

Corrective actions are being undertaken by this Department to sensitize famers, inter-alia on judicious use of chemical pesticides. This Department has established 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centres (CIPMCs) across the country. These CIPMCs propagate the use of Integrated Pest Management and recommend judicious use of chemical pesticide. The CIPMCs, inter alia, releases bio-control agents in the fields, conducts Famers Field Schools and organizes IPM orientation programs. In the last three years, 5957.25 million of bio-control agents have been released, 2142 nos. of Farmers Field Schools and 391 nos. of IPM orientation programs have been organized by the CIPMCs. Furthermore, the Annual reports of the ‘MPRNL’ Scheme are also being shared with the State agriculture department to take corrective measures.

                The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and private companies are already engaged in the development of hybrids and High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) seeds of different crops suitable for the varied agro climatic conditions of the country for increasing yield of various crops. During last five years more than 100 hybrids (maize-44, pearl millet-13, sorghum-5, rice-3, sunflower-9, castor-7, sesame-2 and cotton 23) have been released under different All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs) of respective crops by ICAR Institutes and State Agricultural Universities.

Govt. is promoting hybrids and also high yielding varieties of different crops by providing financial assistance to States and implementing agencies through various ongoing crop development programmes/schemes viz.  National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India (BGREI), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) etc.

Financial assistance is being provided for distribution of hybrid seeds of rice, maize, jowar, bajra, @ 50% cost or Rs. 10,000 per qtl. whichever is less. Similarly financial assistance is also available for promoting use of hybrids of oilseed crops @ 50% cost or Rs. 8,000 per qtl. whichever is less under above schemes.

                The ambit of the PM- Kisan Scheme has been expanded to cover all farmers in the country irrespective of the size of their land holdings, subject to the other existing exclusion criteria. 

The total number of landholding farmers in the country is about 15.11 crore, which has been estimated on the basis of projections of Agricultural Census 2015-16 data for 2018-19. The State-wise details is at Annexure-I. The total number of beneficiary farmer families under the Scheme, after application of exclusion clause, is estimated to be 14.50 crore. 

As per the provisions of the Scheme, the entire responsibility of identifying the eligible beneficiary farmers and uploading their data on PM-KISAN Portal for enabling release of benefits to them is entrusted to the State/UT Governments only. They have already been requested to expedite 100% enlistment of eligible beneficiaries for the revised Scheme and timely uploading of corrected data on PM-KISAN portal. The Central Government on its part regularly monitors the uploading of data by them through Video Conferencing with their State Nodal Officers (PM-Kisan) and Principal Secretaries (Agriculture).

Farmers who do not own any land are not eligible for this scheme; and

The survey of landless farmers has not been conducted, therefore, their exact numbers are not available. However, State-wise number of wholly leased-in operational holdings as per the Agriculture Census 2010-11 is available and is annexed at Annexure-II.  Various schemes run by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers’ Welfare aim at benefitting the cultivators irrespective of the ownership status, though the PM-Kisan Scheme’s benefit is aimed at land owning farmers.

                The Government had constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same. The Committee has submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018. The Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI) recognises agriculture as a value led enterprise and has identified seven major sources of growth, viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations.

National Sample Survey (NSS) conducted a Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural Households during its 70th round (January - December 2013) in the rural areas of the country with reference to the agricultural year July 2012- June 2013. Among various indicators related to the agricultural households, the survey collected information on income generated by agricultural households from different economic activities (both farm and non-farm) during the agricultural year July 2012 –June 2013 which is given at Annexure.

 Agriculture being a State subject, the State Governments undertakes development of perspective plans and ensure effective implementation of the programmes/ schemes. Also, Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various Schemes/ Programmes aimed at improving production, post harvest & management, including progressive agri-market reforms,   access to credit,  risk management and income support. Some important programmes 

are as follows:


	Kisan Credit Cards provides agriculture credit to farmers at subsidized rates, with a 2% interest


subvention (IS) and Prompt Repayment Incentive (PRI) of 3% so as to make the effective rate of interest as 4%. The initiatives to simplify procedures for availing KCC include:


	Activities relating to Animal Husbandry and Fisheries included in KCC - benefits of  IS and PRI also extended
	Indian Banker’s Association has waived off processing fee, inspection, ledger folio charges and all other service charges for renewal/fresh issue of KCC. 
	RBI has raised the collateral free existing agriculture loan limit from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.1.60 lakh. 


ii)  With a view to provide better insurance coverage to crops for risk mitigation, Government has launched a crop insurance scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) from Kharif 2016 season. This scheme provides insurance cover for all stages of the crop cycle including post-harvest risks in specified instances. Claims of Rs. 8,665 crore were paid to 553.01 lakh farmers in the year 2018-19.

iii)    Giving a major boost for the farmers income, the Government has approved the increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSPs) for all Kharif & Rabi crops for 2018-19 season at a level of at least 150 percent of the cost of production.

iv)  With a view to provide income support to all farmers’ families across the country, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs, the Central Government started a new Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN). The scheme aims to provide a payment of Rs. 6000/- per year, in three 4-monthly installments of Rs. 2000/- to the farmers, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income groups.  An amount of Rs. 12646.579 crore has been distributed to 632.32895 lakh farmers in the year 2018-19.

v)   With a view to provide social security net for Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood, the Government has decided to implement another new Central Sector Scheme for providing old age pension to these farmers. Under this Scheme, a minimum fixed pension of Rs. 3000/- be provided to the eligible small and marginal farmers, subject to certain exclusion clauses, on attaining the age of 60 years. The scheme aims to cover around 5 crore beneficiaries in the first three years. It would be a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The Government has approved a budgetary provision of Rs. 10774.50 crore for the scheme till March, 2022.

                 Government has set a target of doubling of farmers’ income by the year 2022. The Government has constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee to examine issues relating to doubling of farmers’ income and recommend a strategy to achieve doubling of farmers’ income in real terms by the year 2022.

The committee has, inter-alia, appreciated the role of Digital Technology, which can play a transformational role in modernizing and organizing how rural India performs its agricultural activities. The technologies include Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Block chain Technology, Internet of Things etc. By use of the modern/advance technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and giving accurate and timely information regarding crops, weather and insects etc. to the farmers may improve the crop productivity, reduce the risk and improve the income of the farmers. Major technology interventions include: -


	Development of Kisan Suvidha mobile application to facilitate dissemination of information to farmers on the critical parameters viz., Weather; Market Prices; Plant Protection; input Dealers (Seed, Pesticide, Fertilizer) Farm Machinery; extreme weather alerts; Soil Health Card; Cold Storages & Godowns; Veterinary Centres and Diagnostic Labs. With market information, farmers are better informed about markets to sell produce, prevailing market prices and quantity demanded in the market. Thus, they can make informed decisions to sell produce at the right price and right time. 



	Development of ‘Farm Machinery package for Different Agro-Climatic Zones in India’ mobile application, which gives information on farm machinery package available for state-wise, agro-climatic zone wise, district-wise, cropping pattern wise and power source wise.
	Development of ‘My Ciphet’ mobile application to help farmers to get precise information regarding the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) developed post-harvest technologies, products and machineries. 
	ICAR has also compiled more than 100 mobile apps developed by ICAR, State Agricultural Universities  and Krishi Vigyan Kendras and uploaded on its website. These mobile apps developed in the areas of crops, horticulture, veterinary, dairy, poultry, fisheries, natural resources management and integrated subjects,  offer valuable information to the farmers, including package of practices, market prices of various commodities, weather related information, advisory services, etc. 



	Development of mKisan Portal (www.mkisan.gov.in) for sending advisories on various crop related matter to the registered farmers through SMSs.
	Launching of e-National Agriculture Market initiative to provide farmers an electronic online trading platform. 
	Introduction of Soil Health Card Scheme to assist State Governments in providing Soil Health Cards to all farmers across the country once in a cycle of 2 years. Soil health card provides information to the farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendations on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving crop productivity and soil fertility.
	Using machine learning process along with different computer algorithm for crop classification and area estimation. 


The Government has also set up 713 Krishi Vigyan Kendras and 684 Agricultural Technology Management Agencies at district level for dissemination of technologies among farm community. In addition, farmers are provided information through Focused Publicity Campaigns, Kisan Call Centres, Agri-Clinics and Agri-Business Centres  of entrepreneurs, Agri Fairs and exhibitions, Kisan SMS Portal, etc.

                Weather monitoring system is used to help the farmers in making better agricultural decisions like carrying out timely sowing of crops according to weather forecast. Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is providing agriculture related information including ‘Weather conditions’ to the farmers through Kisan Call Centre operating from 21 locations in 22 local languages. In addition, DAC&FW is also providing weather related information through its regular mass media and outreach programmes being telecast/broadcast through Doordarshan, DD Kisan and All India Radio. The crops and weather based advisories are also disseminated through m-kisan portal to registered farmers.

To ascertain the risk factor, Agriculture Contingency Plans for 648 districts have been updated and uploaded on the Department’s Portal which serve as a ready reckoner for Line Departments and farming community on the prevailing farming systems and technological interventions to manage various weather aberrations such as droughts, floods, cyclones, hailstorms, heat and cold waves. These cover different sectors of agriculture including crops, horticulture, livestock, poultry and fisheries.

Besides, India Meteorological Department (IMD) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) implements an operational Agromet Advisory Service (AAS) scheme, viz., Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) for the benefit of farming community in the country. Under GKMS scheme, district level weather forecast including rainfall for the next five days for all the districts is generated. Based on the weather forecast, Agromet Advisories are prepared in collaboration with 130 Agromet Field Units (AMFUs) and communicated to the farming community. AAS rendered by IMD is a step to weather-based crop and livestock management strategies and operations dedicated to enhancing crop production besides reducing crop damage and loss due to extreme weather events.

            By making use of modern technology, Agromet Advisories are being disseminated through SMS and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) using Kisan Portal launched by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare and also private companies like IKSL, Reliance Foundation and Mahindra Samriddhi under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. In addition to the above means of communication, the AMFUs also use social media like WhatsApp and other mobile Apps developed for the purpose. Further, Kisan Suvidha mobile application has been developed by the Department to facilitate dissemination of information to farmers on the critical parameters viz., weather; market prices; plant protection; input Dealers (Seed, Pesticide, Fertilizer) farm machinery; soil health card; cold storages & godowns, veterinary centres and diagnostic labs.  This app is available in 9 languages viz., English, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Oriya, Punjabi, Marathi, Bengla and Telugu.

                  The fund released by the Government of India to States/UTs under e-NAM Scheme based on need  during 2015-16 to 2018-19 is Rs. 423.23 crore. The fund  released to Madhya Pradesh during 2015-16 to 2018-19 under e-NAM is Rs. 50.42 crore.  Many facilities are available to farmers at e-mandis for using e-NAM platform among which the major facilities are as under: 

(i)  Farmers can access the prevailing commodity prices information on e-NAM mobile app even without going to the mandi. 

(ii) Facility of pre-registration of lot by farmers for their produce available through mobile app to facilitate quick gate entry of the lot during peak season. 

(iii)  Facility of quality testing of the produce of the farmers before bidding. 

(iv) Farmers may view progress of online bid value of their produce through mobile. 

(v)  The details of final bid rate of commodity of farmer are received through SMS by farmers. 

(vi)  Online payment gateway is available for transfer of bid value directly to bank accounts of farmers. 

 The facilities provided to farmers in e-NAM mandis are continuously reviewed by the Government.   The   feedback   on the   various   facilities,  such as, quality assaying, e-trading, e-payment etc. is provided to States to improve their functioning. As an outcome of the continuous review, the facilities such as inter-mandi trade, inter-state trade, quality assaying, number of commodities on e-NAM, e-trading, e-payment etc. have improved. The number of farmers and buyers registered on e-NAM platform have been continuously increasing. 

Three reforms are mandatory for States/Union Territories (UTs) in their respective State Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts for integrating their mandis with National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) platform i.e. (i) Provision for e-trading, (ii) Single point levy of market fee, (iii) Unified Single trading license for the State. States without APMC Act like Bihar need to provide legally enforceable guidelines and institutional mechanism for implementing e-NAM. Based on the proposals received from the compliant States/Union Territories (UTs), mandis are considered for integration by Government of India  with e-NAM platform. However, Government of Bihar has not proposed any of their market for integration with e-NAM platform. Number of farmers who have sold their produce on e-NAM platform in Madhya Pradesh is 10,80,704.

                Government has conducted several studies to measure and quantify the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture. Extensive field and simulation studies were carried out in agriculture and allied sectors by several network centers consisting of ICAR Institutes such as Indian Agricultural Research Institute at New Delhi, Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture at Hyderabad, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Kochi, Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Bangalore etc. and State Agricultural Universities, located in different parts of the country. The climate change impact assessment was carried out using the crop simulation models by incorporating the projected climates of 2020, 2050 and 2080. Most of the results were obtained through incorporating the future projections by using modeling techniques like Had CM3 model.  From these projections, variability in temperature and rainfall pattern was observed in future periods with significant impact on crop yields. The Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment (INCCA) of the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) has studied the climate change impact assessment in the Himalayan region.

 

Clear indications of change in climate are being noticed in the country. Last three decades saw a sharp rise in all India mean annual temperature.  

 

Spatio-temporal variations in projected changes in temperature and rainfall are likely to lead to differential impacts in the different regions.  However, the major crops classified as risk prone under the  impacts of climate change with reduced productivity are – Rice & Wheat especially in the Indo Gangetic Plains, Maize in Mid Indo-Gangetic Plains (MIGP) & Southern Plateau (SP), Sorghum & potato in West Bengal, and Southern Plateau.

The productivity is expected to increase in Soybean, Groundnut, Chickpea & Potato in Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, Apple in Himachal Pradesh.  

 

Government is committed to provide security to farmers.   To provide claims against the crop yield losses due to natural risks/calamities, adverse weather conditions, pests & diseases etc. two major crop insurance schemes namely, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) are being implemented by the Government.   PMFBY provides comprehensive risk coverage from pre-sowing to post harvest losses against non-preventable natural risks.  The RWBCIS provides indemnification for likely crop losses due to deviation in weather indices.  Further, to provide adequate risk coverage the sum insured has been equated to Scale of Finance at minimum uniform fixed premium rate payable by farmers i.e. maximum 2% for Kharif crops, 1.5% for Rabi Crop and 5% for annual commercial/horticultural crops, with balance of actuarial/bidded premium being shared by the Central and State Government on 50 : 50 basis;  lowering of unit area of insurance to village/village panchayat level for major crops and to individual farm level for localised risks of hailstorm, landslide and inundation and post-harvest losses thereby promoting more realistic assessment of losses.  In addition, assistance is also provided to farmers through other schemes namely,  PM KISAN (for regular income), PM ASHA (Price support), National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for relief due to natural calamities etc.

                The National Green Tribunal in the order passed on 10.12.2015, directed and prohibited agricultural residue burning in any part of the NCT of Delhi, State of Rajasthan, State of Punjab, State of Uttar Pradesh and State of Haryana.

Paddy Stubble burning is mainly practiced in Indo-gangetic plains of the States of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to clear the fields for Rabi Crop sowing. However, as informed by other States, the severities of uncontrolled crop residue burning incidences are not significant.   

In 2018, a new Central Sector Scheme on ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi’ has been launched with the total outgo from the Central funds of Rs. 1151.80 crore. 

During 2018-19, funds amounting to Rs. 269.38 crores, Rs.137.84 crores and Rs. 148.60 crores have been released to the Government of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh respectively for distribution of in-situ crop residue management machinery to the farmers on subsidy, establishment of Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) of in-situ crop residue management machinery and undertaking Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities for creating awareness among farmers.

During 2019-20, the funds amounting to Rs. 248.00 crores, Rs.175.00 crores and                Rs. 97.54 crores have also been released so far to the Government of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, respectively.

Any person or body that is found offending the directions of National Green Tribunal is liable to pay Environmental Compensation and it is collected by the concerned State Governments. As per the information received from the State Governments, the Government of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have only collected the Environmental Compensation towards burning of crop residue, as stated below.

                The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, through Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) has involved 8 agencies/ organizations to carry out pilot studies for Optimization of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in various States including Andhra Pradesh under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).

During Kharif 2018, the Pilot Study was conducted for paddy crop in West Godavari district and during Rabi 2018-19, the study is being conducted in East Godavari and Krishna districts.  The studies used various technologies, including Satellite data, Artificial Intelligence, Modeling tools etc. for reducing the number of CCEs required for insurance unit level for yield estimation.  The studies have showed the possibility of reducing the number of CCEs up to 25-70% (depending upon crops and location), through the use of technology.

Carrying out large number of CCEs for calculation of yield data vis-à-vis claims at Gram Panchayat level is a major issue under PMFBY.  A High Power Committee has been constituted to evaluate results obtained in these studies and provide recommendations for their implementation in the upcoming seasons.

                The Government has set a target of doubling of farmers’ income by the year 2022. The Government has constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee to examine issues relating to doubling of farmers’ income and recommend a strategy to achieve doubling of farmers’ income in real terms by the year 2022. The committee has, inter-alia, appreciated the role of Digital Technology, which can play a transformational role in modernizing and organizing how rural India performs it’s agricultural activities. The technologies include Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Block chain Technology, Internet of Things etc. The deployment of technology is very important to make schemes of the Ministry successful. Major technology interventions include : 

 


	  Development of Kisan Suvidha mobile application to facilitate dissemination of information to farmers on the critical parameters viz., Weather; Market Prices; Plant Protection; input Dealers (Seed, Pesticide, Fertilizer) Farm Machinery;  Soil Health Card; Cold Storages & Godowns, Veterinary Centres and Diagnostic Labs. With market information, Farmers are better informed about markets to sell produce, prevailing market prices and quantity demanded in the market. Thus, they can make informed decisions to sell produce at the right price and right time. 


 


	The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has also compiled more than 100 mobile apps developed by ICAR, State Agricultural Universities  and Krishi Vigyan Kendras and uploaded on its website. These mobile apps developed in the areas of crops, horticulture, veterinary, dairy, poultry, fisheries, natural resources management and integrated subjects,  offer valuable information to the farmers, including package of practices, market prices of various commodities, weather related information, advisory services, etc. 


 


	Development of  mKisan Portal (www.mkisan.gov.in) for sending advisories on various crop related matter to the registered farmers through SMSs.


 


	Launching of e-National Agriculture Market initiative to provide farmers an electronic online trading platform.


 


	Implementation of  Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, sub-scheme of Integrated Scheme of Agricultural Marketing, in order to improve/create scientific storage capacity for storing farm produce, processed farm produce and to reduce post-harvest storage loss.


 


	Introduction of Soil Health Card Scheme to assist State Governments in providing Soil Health Cards to all farmers across the country once in a cycle of 2 years Soil health card provides information to the farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendations on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving crop productivity and soil fertility.


 


	Providing subsidies under National Food Security Mission (Oil Seeds and Oil Palm) to farmers on seed components, transfer of technologies, production inputs and water carrying devices. Financial assistance is also being provided under this scheme for block demonstration, frontline demonstration, farmers training to educate farmers to adopt modern techniques of farming to yield good crop economically.


 


	Use of  space technology for various programmes/ areas such as Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land-based Observations project,  Coordinated programame on Horticulture Assessment and Management using geo-informatics project, National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System, Rice-Fallow Area Mapping and intensification, geo tagging of infrastructure and assets created under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana,  and Crop Insurance.  


 


	Using machine learning process alongwith  different computer algorithm for crop classification and area estimation. 


 

The Government has also set up 713 Krishi Vigyan Kendras and 684 Agricultural Technology Management Agencies at district level for dissemination of technologies among farm community. In addition, farmers are  provided information  through Focused Publicity Campaigns, Kisan Call Centres, Agri-Clinics and Agri-Business Centres of entrepreneurs, Agri Fairs and exhibitions, Kisan SMS Portal, etc.

Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar  chaired a meeting with Agriculture Ministers of all States/UTs via Video Conference today and discussed the implementation of three key schemes of Government of India namely Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojna (PM-Kisan), Pension Scheme for Small and Marginal Farmers and Kisan Credit Card Campaign.

Union Agriculture Minister urged all States/UTs to expedite the process of enrolment of all eligible farmer families/ beneficiaries in a time bound manner so that the benefit under PM-KISAN for the period from April to July, 2019 can be transferred directly to their bank accounts. 

The Minister also informed all States/UTs regarding rolling out of Pension Scheme for Farmers belonging to the age group of 18-40 years. He also requested all States/ UTs to create awareness about the Pension Scheme. 

Shri Tomar also requested all States to organise village –wise campaign to cover one crore farmers under Kisan Credit Card Scheme within next hundred days. 

The PM-Kisan Yojna is an income support scheme for farmers. It is a 100% central sector scheme which will give farmers Rs. 6000/- per year in 3 equal instalments. From 01.04.2019, the scheme has been extended to cover all farmers, the total beneficiaries will be 14.5 crores. During the video conference it was stressed that there should be 100% enlistment of eligible beneficiaries by States/UT’s, timely uploading of corrected data on PM-Kisan portal and establishment of proper redressal Mechanism. 

The pension scheme for small and marginal farmers will provide a social security net for all such farmers. Under this scheme a minimum fixed pension of Rs 3000 per month will be provided to the eligible small and marginal farmers subject to certain exclusion causes on attaining the age of 60 years. The scheme aims to cover around 5 crore beneficiaries in the first three years. It will be a voluntary and contributory pension scheme with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The beneficiary can opt to become member of the scheme by subscribing to a pension fund. The beneficiary would be required to contribute Rs. 100 per month at median entry age of 29 years. The Central government shall also contribute to the Pension Fund in equal amount. Contribution shall be made to a Pension Fund managed by the LIC which will be responsible for the pension pay out. Under the scheme farmers can also opt to allow contribution to be made directly from the benefits drawn from the PM-KISAN scheme. There will be an online grievance redressal system for complete transparency.

The Kisan Credit Card was introduced in 1998, presently there are 6.92 crore live KCCs against 14.5 crore operational landholdings. The recent initiatives for KCC saturation include adding farmers engaged in Animal Husbandry & Fisheries; removal of inspection ledger folio charges and processing fee of loan under KCC; raising limit of collateral fee on existing agriculture loan from l lakh to 1.6 lakhs. DAC & FW on 04.02.2019 advised all Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries of State/UT Administration to launch KCC saturation drive. During the proposed saturation drive, bank wise or village wise campaigns will be organised to collect KCC application forms. States like Gujrat, Maharashtra, UP, Chhattisgarh, WB, Bihar, Jharkhand, HP, J&K and NER states have already been identified where KCC penetration was found lagging. A target of 1 crore is to be achieved in the next 100 days.

                Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda, while giving a written replies to questions on availability of fertilizers in the country, in Lok Sabha today, stated that Department of Fertilizers ensures adequate availability of fertilizers to the farmers. However, distribution within the State is the responsibility of the concerned State Government.

The Minister stated that availability of fertilizers is monitored at the State level through data captured in the integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS). As per the system, there is no shortage of any fertilizer in the country. The fertilizer requirement, availability and sales position for Kharif 2019, as on 21.06.2019 as per iFMS data is as follows:

<Figures in LMT>


	
		
			
			 
			
			
			Projected Requirement
			
			
			Availability
			
			
			Sales
			
		
		
			
			Urea
			
			
			59.47
			
			
			61.82
			
			
			49.28
			
		
		
			
			P&K (DAP,MOP & Complex)
			
			
			46.91
			
			
			71.80
			
			
			30.06
			
		
	


 

It may be seen from the table above that the availability of fertilizers has been more than the sales. 

Shri Gowda stated in detail the steps that are being taken by the Government to ensure adequate supply of fertilizers across the country. He informed that before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers.

 

On the basis of month-wise & state-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability through following system:

 

i.) The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);

 

ii.) The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.

 

iii.) Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Department of Fertilizers (DoF), and Ministry of Railways with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments.

 

iv.) The gap between demand (requirement) and production is met through imports. The import for the season is also finalised well in advance to ensure timely availability.

In addition to the above steps, the Minister informed that the Government of India is reviving five closed fertilizer plants. These include Talcher, Ramagundam, Gorakhpur and Sindri plants of Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (FCIL) and Barauni plant of Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Ltd. (HFCL), by setting up new Ammonia Urea plants of 12.7 Lakh metric tonne per annum capacity each. These projects upon implementation/ operationalization will bridge the gap between demand and supply of urea in the country and will rejuvenate the fertilizer sector. 

 

Shri Gowda stated that subsequent to commissioning/ start of the above plants, the indigenous urea production will be enhanced by 63.5 Lakh Metric Tonne per year leading to corresponding reduction in import of urea. Government of India has also proposed to set up a new Ammonia-Urea Plant at Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizers Corporation Limited (BVFCL), Namrup-IV having capacity of 12.70 LMT or Urea through nomination (PSU) route, the Minister added.

                Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda, while giving a written reply to a question on subsidies on fertilizers, in Rajya Sabha today, stated that there is no proposal at present to decrease the amount of subsidies on fertilizers. In a written reply to another question in Rajya Sabha today, Shri Gowda stated that there is no proposal for fixing a Nutrient – Based Subsidy rate (NBS) for urea and hence, question does not arise to decontrol the prices of urea in the market.

 

The Minister stated that for Potassic & Phosphatic (P&K) fertilizers, the Government is implementing Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Scheme w.e.f 1.4.2010. Under the NBS Policy, the Government announces a fixed rate of subsidy (in Rs. per Kg basis), on each nutrient of subsidized P&K fertilizers, namely Nitrogen (N), Phosphate (P), Potash (K) and Sulphur (S), on annual basis taking into account all relevant factors including international prices, exchange rate, inventory level and prevailing Maximum Retail Prices of P&K fertilizers. The per Kg subsidy rates on the nutrients N, P, K, S are converted into per Tonne subsidy on the various subsidized P&K fertilizers covered under NBS Policy.

 

Shri Gowda further stated that urea is being provided to the farmers at a statutorily notified Maximum Retail Price (MRP). The MRP of 45 kg bag of Urea is Rs. 242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable) and the MRP of 50 kg bag of Urea is Rs. 268 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable). The difference between the delivered cost of fertilizers at farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as subsidy to the urea manufacturer / importer by the Government of India, the Minister added.

 

The amount of fertilizer subsidy paid during the last two years is as under:

 


	
		
			
			Year
			
			
			Gross subsidy paid

			(in Rs. Crores)
			
		
		
			
			2017-18
			
			
			69197.96
			
		
		
			
			2018-19
			
			
			73435.21

Union Minister of State for Shipping (Independent Charge) and Chemical & Fertilizers, Mansukh Mandaviya convened a review meeting regarding supply and availability of fertilizers in Jammu and Kashmir.The Minister said that avenues would be explored to set up storage facilities for fertilizers, to create a buffer stock and ensure no shortages occur during peak demand seasons. 

 

Shri Mandaviya was also apprised of the problems being faced in the fertilizer movement in the State, the need for augmenting current infrastructure including need for opening of additional rake points, to whichhe said that the demand would be taken into consideration.

 

The Minister also asked the fertilizer supplying companies to ensure timely stocking of fertilizers particularly in the valley in view of the closure of Jammu–Srinagar National Highway during winter and inclement weather conditions.

 

Shri Mandaviya directed officers of the State Agriculture Production Department and the fertilizer supplying companies to adhere to the guidelines and deadlines to bring transparency in the fertilizer business and to ensure timely supply of quality fertilizers to the farmers. He asked to monitor the correct data entry regarding fertilizer stocks and sale records by the Wholesalers and Retailers in their respective areas.

 

Stressing on the importance of inculcating sustainable and organic agricultural practices in farmers, the Minister said that indiscriminate and injudicious use of chemical fertilizers is harmful for the health of humans as well as animals. It is essential that government actively supports farmers to shift to organic practices that will not only yield healthy crop but also help improve structure and quality of the soil and increase its ability to hold water and nutrients.’

 

For this, Shri Mandaviya asked the department to actively promote use of organic/bio-fertilizers in the State. He also asked the department to engage with agriculture experts to identify sustainable ways for adoption of need-based technology in farm sector.

 

The meeting wasattended by senior officers of State Agriculture Production Department and the fertilizer supplying companies.

                In a meeting on 28th June 2017, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had in-principle approved the consideration for strategic disinvestment of Air India & its five subsidiaries. An Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) was constituted by CCEA for this. 

In an AISAM Meeting held on 28th March 2018, which is last year, it was decided that due to issues like volatile crude oil prices & adverse fluctuations in exchange rates, the atmosphere was not conducive for the disinvestment. But this was last year. 

However, continued support from the govt had resulted in improvement of financial & operational performance of Air India. As per the recommendations of AISAM, the govt will now go ahead with the process of disinvestment of the company.

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (I/c) for Civil Aviation today inaugurated the Air Traffic Flow Management - Central Command Centre at Vasant Kunj, New Delhi in the presence of Chairman, AAI; Board Members and senior AAI officials.

The C-ATFM system is primarily meant to address the balancing of capacity against the demand to achieve optimum utilization of the major resources viz., airport, airspace and aircraft at every Indian airport where there is a capacity constraint.

The C-ATFM system integrates flight data from various subsystems like ATC Automation System, flight updates and flight update messages. The system also displays weather information along with static information about airports, airspaces and air routes.  The system processes the demand and capacity information and provides decision-making tools to the ATFM Flow Manager for collaborative decision making and to ensure regulated flow of traffic at each airport in India.

The C-ATFM system is supported by 36 Flow Management Positions (FMP) at various airports including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad among others. Eight defense airports are also part of the ATFM network which are provided with FMPs.

After successfully implementing the Air Traffic Flow Management System, India has become the seventh country after the US, Europe, Australia, South Africa, Japan, Brazil.

“With the commissioning of the Central Command Centre of the Central Air Traffic Flow Management Complex, we have made an humble beginning today. With this facility, in the next five years, we will be comparable to what the best of the world have to offer,” said Dr. Guruprasad Mohapatra, Chairman, Airports Authority of India.

                In the year 2018-19, Coal India Limited (CIL) had supplied 491.54 Million Tonnes (MT) coal to power plants which was 8.2% more than the coal supplied in 2017-18. Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) supplied 55.3 MT coal to power plants in 2018-19 which was a growth of 3.6% over the same period of previous year. This has led to creation of a coal stock of 30.95 MT at the power plants as on 31.03.2019 which was sufficient for 18 days requirement. In 2018-19, the power plants of Tangedco have been supplied 23.26 MT coal from CIL with a growth of 3.5% over the supply of 22.49 MT in 2017-18. As on 16.06.2019, Tamil Nadu power plants have coal stock of 9.67 lakh tonne which is sufficient for 12 days requirement. At present, no power plant in Tamil Nadu is in critical/super critical category. Some of the numerous steps taken to augment coal supply to power plants are:

 


	The power plants in close vicinity of coal fields have been advised to move coal through road mode.
	For proper utilization of Goods sheds, the power plants have been advised to move coal through road-cum-rail mode.
	Optimal utilization of the captive modes of transport like, MGR, Belts, Ropes to move coal to the concerned power plants.
	Supply of coal to Power plants through rail mode is prioritized.
	Coal supplies to Power sector is monitored regularly by an Inter-Ministerial Sub-group comprising representative of Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Shipping, Coal India Limited etc. 


 

As a result of these steps, coal stock at power plants as on 16.06.2019 has increased to 27.01 MT from 15.44 MT as on 16.06.2018.

This information was given by the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Shri Pralhad Joshi in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

                Ministry of Coal has issued the Policy for Linkage Rationalization for Independent Power Producers (IPPs) on 15.05.2018. The policy envisages to undertake a comprehensive review of existing sources of coal and consider the feasibility for rationalization of sources with a view to optimize the transportation cost and materialization taking into account coal availability and logistics.

As per request received from consumers, linkage rationalization of eligible IPPs has been done at Coal India Limited (CIL) for a total rationalized quantity of 2 Million Tonnes. The annual potential savings estimated by Central Electricity Authority for the above rationalization would be about Rs. 118 crore.

                A delegation of six major tobacco exportersled by Ms. K Sunitha, Chairperson of Indian Tobacco Board under the Department of Commerce, Government of India, visited China from 24th to 28th June 2019. Representatives of ITC Ltd, PolisettySomasundaram, Deccan Tobacco Company, Godfrey Phillips India Ltd, Premier Tobacco Packers Ltd and M L Exports representing more than 70% of tobacco exports from India were part of the delegation. 

On 28th June, the delegation had a meeting with Chief Commissioner of STMA (State Tobacco Monopoly Administration), Mr. Zhang Jianmin. Ms. Sunithahighlighted the strengths of Indian tobacco during the meeting. She mentioned that Indian tobacco is of high quality,organically cultivated, and pesticide residue free. India is the only country in the world where tobacco is produced in two seasons. She also mentioned that India due to its proximity could bring down the logistic costs in exporting tobacco to China. India is the third largest producer and exporter of unmanufactured tobacco with exports more than Rs.5000 crores to more than 115 destinations, including the quality conscious markets like Japan and Europe.  Chairperson of Indian Tobacco Boardreiterated that India is well positioned to supply superior quality tobacco with consistency in price, volume, quality and compliance. However,exports of tobacco from India to China have been negligible. Recently, in January 2019, during the visit of Commerce Secretary Dr. Anup Wadhawan, the otherwise dormant protocol on the export of Indian tobacco leaves to China was extended for next five years removing a major technical barrier in exporting to China. Since then, the Embassy of India in Beijing worked intensively with the Chinese authorities like State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, Ministry of Commerce and other relevant organisations for promoting Indian tobacco.

Mr. Zhang Jianmin welcomed the delegation and appreciated efforts to promote Indian tobacco. While Indian tobacco may not be currently suitable for the Chinese market, he mentioned that in the backdrop  of growing bilateral relations between India and China, STMA will be happy to work with the Indian Tobacco Board to further leverage complementarities. The Tobacco Board offered that with the production processes matching global standards, India will be able to produce and offer tobacco varieties which suit China. The Chief Commissioner promised that he will send a government and industry delegation to India to further explore the opportunities.

Mr Prashant Lokhande, Commercial Counsellor, while giving the background of growing commercial and economic relations with the trade moving to $100 billion mark, emphasised on the need to address the trade deficit. He informed about the progress made post-Wuhan Summit and hoped that with the support of STMA and in the background of strengths of Indian tobacco on quality and price, it will find its place in the Chinese market.

Ambassador,Mr.VikramMisri, briefed the delegation about the need for extensive engagement in this market to sustain the momentum.

The delegation also visited YuxiYanhe county in Yunnan and Tongxiang in Zhejiang province and interacted with the local tobacco production and trading agencies.

                Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways, PiyushGoyal, reviewed the draft National Logistics Policy and the proposed action plan for implementation of the policy prepared by the Department of Logistics, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The draft National Logistics Policy has been prepared in consultation with the Ministries of Railways, Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Civil Aviation. Forty-six Partnering Government Agencies (PGAs) inputs wereanalysed in detail for consideration in the Policy.

Commerce and Industry Minister in his opening remarks urged that all the four Ministries and their departments must leverage existing infrastructure to support each other in the logistics chain. This will not only help in maximizing capacity utilization but also reduce costs he added.

PiyushGoyal directed that all four Ministries must work in coordination with each other so that the 14% logistics cost of India’s GDP may be brought down to 9%.  In the meeting all aspects of logistics related to railways, civil aviation, shipping and inland waterways, road transport, ropeways warehousing and cold chain were discussed in detail.   

PiyushGoyal exhorted the line Ministries that all efforts must be made for farm produce of food grains, fruits and vegetables to reach from farm to market with minimum wastage of time. He also said that a central scheme for cold chain across the country especially for fruits, vegetables and perishables may be made part of the action plan of the draft logistics policy so that it improves efficiency and reduces the loss in agri produce of farmers. 

During the review meeting issues relating to rail freight rationalization and freight policy for Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC), having immediate implications for modal shift,were discussed at length. 

Commerce and Industry Minister also directed that whenever any new road, railway, airport and shipping port project is being considered the Logistics Department must be a part of consultation process so that holistic planning will be possible, freight movement will be rationalized and passenger experience will improve.

India’s logistics sector is highly defragmented andthe aim is to reduce the logistics cost from the present 14% of GDP to less than 10% by 2022. India’s logistics sector is very complex with more than 20 government agencies, 40 PGAs, 37 export promotion councils, 500 certifications, 10000 commodities, 160 billion market size. It also involves 12 million employment base, 200 shipping agencies, 36 logistic services, 129 ICDs, 168 CFSs, 50 IT ecosystems and banks & insurance agencies. Further, 81 authorities and 500 certificates are required for EXIM.

As per the Economic Survey 2017-18, the Indian logistics sector provides livelihood to more than 22 million people and improving the sector will facilitate 10 % decrease in indirect logistics cost leading to the growth of 5 to 8% in exports. Further, the Survey estimates that the worth of Indian logistics market would be around USD 215 billion in next two years compared to about USD 160 billion currently. 

The Commerce and Industry Ministry is formulating the logistics policy so that India’s trade competitiveness grows, more jobs are created, India’s performance in global rankings improves and paves the way for India to become a logistics hub.

                The export and import policies for agricultural products, which include the decisions on lifting and imposing bans on export/import of individual agricultural products, are framed keeping several factors in mind, such as availability of surplus over the domestic requirements (including the requirement of buffer stock and strategic reserve, if any), concerns of food security, diplomatic/humanitarian considerations, international demand and supply situation, price competitiveness, need to balance between remunerative prices to the growers and availability of agricultural products to common man at affordable  prices.  During the last three years, no bans have been imposed on export and import of any of the major agricultural products. As such, no study has been conducted in this regard.

The Agriculture Export Policy, brought out by the Government in December 2018, aims at a stable trade policy for agricultural products, involving following steps:


	Providing assurance that the processed agricultural products and all kinds of organic products will not be brought under the ambit of any kind of export restriction (viz. Minimum Export Price, Export duty, Export bans, Export quota, Export capping and Export permit) even though the primary agricultural product or non-organic agricultural product is brought under some kind of export restrictions.


 


	Identification of a few commodities which are essential for food security in consultation with the relevant stakeholders and Ministries.  Any export restriction on such identified commodities under extreme price situation will be based on decision of a high level committee. Also, any kind of export prohibitions and restrictions on the identified commodities above would be taken up in a WTO compatible manner.


 


	Liberalised import of agricultural products for value addition and re-export.


 

Consequent to the approval of policy, mandate of the Committee of Secretaries on Essential commodities has been expanded to provide recommendation on export restrictions on a few commodities, which are essential for food security, under extreme price situation only.

This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, PiyushGoyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.

                No anti-dumping duty has been imposed recently on Indian shrimp exports by the United States of America. However, US had imposed anti-dumping duty on import of frozen warm water shrimps from certain countries, including India, in 2004, based on the representations of Southern Shrimp Producers Alliance, an association of local shrimp producers in USA.

The Initial anti-dumping duty imposed by US was 10.17% which was reviewed subsequently. Every year there is an administrative review on the duty to be collected, and so far 12 administrative reviews have been conducted. The final result of the 12th administrative review for the period of import from 01.02.2016 to 31.01.2017 has pegged the anti-dumping duty at 1.35 %, which is currently applied to the exporters from India including those from Andhra Pradesh. 

On 23rd April 2019, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of the 13th administrative review of the anti-dumping duty order on certain frozen warm water shrimp from India. Based on these preliminary results for anti-dumping duty rate for Indian companies were at 1.87% and the final result of this review is awaited. 

Even with the imposition of anti- dumping duty the shrimp exports to US have shown a growing trend over the years.

                India has achieved a record high of USD 330. 07 billion of merchandise exports in the year 2018-19, registering a positive growth of 8.75% as compared to the previous year. 

 

Government has taken following steps to increase exports: 

 


	A new Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-20 was launched on 1st April 2015. The policy, inter alia, rationalised the earlier export promotion schemes and introduced two new schemes, namely Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) for improving export of goods   and Services Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) for increasing exports of services. Duty credit scrips issued under these schemes were made fully transferable.


 


	The Mid-term Review of the FTP 2015-20 was undertaken on 5th December, 2017. Incentive rates for labour intensive / MSME sectors were increased by 2% with a financial implication of Rs 8,450 crore per year. 


 


	A new Logistics Division was created in the Department of Commerce to coordinate integrated development of the logistics sector.  India’s rank in World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index moved up from 54 in 2014 to 44 in 2018.


 


	Interest Equalization Scheme on pre and post shipment rupee export credit was introduced from 1.4.2015 providing interest equalisation at 3% for labour intensive / MSME sectors. The rate was increased to 5% for MSME sectors with effect from 2.11.2018 and merchant exporters were covered under the scheme with effect from 2.1.2019. 


 


	Various measures for improving ease of doing business were taken. India’s rank in World Bank ‘Ease of doing business’ ranking improved from 142 in 2014 to 77 in 2018 with the rank in ‘trading across borders’ moving up from 122 to 80.


 


	A new scheme called Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) was launched with effect from 1st April 2017 to address the export infrastructure gaps in the country.


 


	A comprehensive Agriculture Export Policy was launched on 6th December, 2018 with an aim to double farmers’ income by 2022 and provide an impetus to agricultural exports.


 


	A new scheme called Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) scheme has been launched for mitigating disadvantage of higher cost of transportation for export of specified agriculture products.


 


	A new scheme called Scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) covering export of garments and made-ups was notified on 7.3.2019 providing refund of duties/taxes at higher rates.


            

The trade deficit of merchandise goods increased from 162.05 US$ billions in 2017-18 to 183.96 US$ billions in 2018-19. The trade deficit depends upon relative fluctuations in the import and export of different commodities due to various global and domestic factors such as demand and supply in domestic and international markets, currency fluctuations, trade agreements between competing exporting countries with export destination countries, non-tariff barriers by export destination countries, cost of credit, logistics costs, etc. Trade deficit during 2018-19 has increased primarily due to higher imports of petroleum crude and products, electronic goods and machinery items and less export of gems and jewellery, textiles items and marine products.

 

Government has put in place a liberal and transparent policy for FDI, wherein most of the sectors are open to FDI under the automatic route. The Government reviews the FDI policy on an ongoing basis and makes necessary changes from time to time to ensure that India remains attractive and investor friendly destination. FDI in various sectors is allowed in a calibrated manner after having consultations with stakeholders, including concerned Ministries/ Departments, State Governments, apex industry chambers, Associations and other organizations, and taking into consideration their views/comments.

                The bilateral trade in goods and services registered a growth of 14.5% in the year 2018 with the US. The bilateral trade in goods registered a growth of 22.4% (DGCIS figure) and bilateral trade in services registered 9.3% (US Census Bureau) in 2018.

 

India exported goods worth of USD 6.3 billion (as per USTR figures) to U.S. under the GSP programme during the calendar year 2018, which contributed 12.1% of India’s total export to the US in the year. The impact will vary across products, depending on the individual product level concessions constituting the average duty concession of 3.8% on India’s exports to the US in 2018 availing GSP benefits, and other factors specific to each product. 

 

The Minister of Commerce and Industry of India and the US Commerce Secretary recently held a bilateral meeting on 06th May, 2019.

 

The issues covered various areas of mutual concern including a general consensus on taking the trade relationship to a higher level.

 

Trade related issues are a part of any ongoing economic relationship, and will continue to be discussed and addressed as a part of the regular bilateral trade engagement between India and the US.

                India’s share in global trade (merchandise and services) was 2.1% (481.74 USD billion out of total 23,044 USD billion) for exports and 2.6% (600.62 USD billion out of total 23,112 USD billion) for imports in 2017. Exports have been growing on a regular basis since 2016-17 for almost three years and total exports reached a new peak of more than half a trillion dollars, for the first time in 2018-19. Government has taken following key measures for promotion of exports: 

i.        A new Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-20 was launched on 1st April 2015.

The rate was increased to 5% for MSME sectors with effect from 2.11.2018 and merchant exporters were covered under the scheme with effect from 2.1.2019. 

v.       Various measures for improving ease of doing business were taken. India’s rank in World Bank ‘Ease of doing business’ ranking improved from 142 in 2014 to 77 in 2018 with the rank in ‘trading across borders’ moving up from 122 to 80.

vi.      A new scheme called Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) was launched with effect from 1st April 2017 to address the export infrastructure gaps in the country.

vii.     A comprehensive Agriculture Export Policy was launched on 6th December, 2018 with an aim to double farmers’ income by 2022 and provide an impetus to agricultural exports.

viii.    A new scheme called Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) scheme has been launched for mitigating disadvantage of higher cost of transportation for export of specified agriculture products.   

ix.      A new scheme called Scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) covering export of garments and made-ups was notified on 7.3.2019 providing refund of duties/taxes at higher rates. 

Key difficulties faced by the exporters are as follows: 

i Technical and non-technical barriers to trade such as Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) standards imposed on agricultural items and quality standards on manufactured goods. 

ii Tariff advantages to the exporters of competing countries in key export markets due to trade agreements between their countries and destination countries/regions.

iii Higher logistics and financing costs for Indian exporters.

Government has formulated a detailed action plan which is updated regularly based on the feedback from the exporting community, the Export Promotion Councils and other industry associations. State Governments have also been requested to develop an Export Strategy for the State keeping in view the state specific opportunities and challenges. The Board of Trade and the Council for Trade Development and Promotion provide a platform for all the stakeholders, including State governments to discuss the issues impacting exports.

                It has come to the notice of the Government that due to supply situation of raw cashew nut in the international market, certain section of the cashew industry is having issues in operation. The Government has no proposal to introduce a comprehensive scheme for protection of cashew industry at present. Government has taken several steps to address the issues in the cashew industry.   


	Import policy for cashew kernel, broken and cashew kernel, whole has been revised from “free” to “prohibited” with the condition that “import is free if CIF value is above Rs.680/- per kg import of cashew kernel, broken” and “import is free if CIF value is above Rs.720/- per kg import cashew kernel, whole” vide DGFT notification dated 12.06.2019.  
	Basic Custom Duty on import of raw cashew nut has been reduced from 5% to 2.5% w.e.f 01.02.2018.



	Goods and Service Tax (GST) has been reduced to 5% from 12% for Cashew nuts.
	Under Mid Term Review of Foreign Trade Policy (FTP), Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) for cashew was increased to 5% (from 3%) for cashew kernel and 7% (from 5%) for salted/roasted cashew, respectively.
	The Standard Inputs Output Norms (SION) was revised to 1 kg kernel from 5.04 kg of raw cashew nuts as against earlier norms of 1 kg from 4 kg of raw cashew nut for export of Cashew Kernel, from imported raw cashew nut under Advance Authorization Scheme.
	Approved Medium Term Framework (2017-2020) Scheme for Process Mechanization and Automation of Cashew Processing Units with financial outlay of Rs.60.00 crore.  A sum of Rs.5.00 crore has been released to Cashew Export Promotion Council till March,2019 as grant-in-aid under MTF (2017-20).
	Duty free import of raw cashew nuts is allowed under Duty Free Tariff Preference (DFTP) Scheme from Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
	Extended financial assistance to Cashew Export Promotion Council of India (CEPCI) for organizing Buyer Seller Meet (BSM) and participation in International fair under Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme, in order to tap new markets and branding.  


Indian cashew industry is heavily dependent on the imported raw cashew nuts (about 50% of requirement) for fulfilling domestic and export demand for cashew kernels.  Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), has drawn up strategies to increase domestic production by massive area expansion of cashew and replacing of senile cashew plantations with high yielding varieties in traditional and non-traditional states. DAC&FW has approved the roadmap programme of Directorate of Cashew nut & Cocoa Development (DCCD) to extend the area of cashew cultivation by 1.20 lakh hectare.  Production of raw cashew nut during 2017-18 has increased by 4.83 % to 8,17,045 Metric Tons as compared to production of 7,79,335 Metric Tons during 2016-17 and 21.89% increase compared to the production of 6,70,300 Metric Tons during 2015-16.

                A section of the industry has opined that some of the conditions like requirements of local experience, are limiting their participation in the Chinese procurement process. Government of India has been engaging with the relevant Chinese Government entities to ensure that Indian companies get market access for its products. Such issues are also discussed in the bilateral meetings from time to time to find solutions to any such restrictions in market access.

 

Government of India has been taking continuous and sustained steps to bridge the trade deficit by lowering trade barriers for Indian exports to China. During the 11thsession of India-China Joint Group on Economic Relations(JEG) held in New Delhi on 26thMarch 2018, the two countries agreed to increase bilateral trade in a more balanced and sustainable manner. In this regard, various meetings have been held at the official level with Chinese counterparts as a part of our ongoing efforts, to obtain market access for various Indian agricultural, dairy, and pharmaceutical products in light of the potential of these products in the Chinese market. Various protocols have been signed to facilitate export of Indian rice, rapeseed meal, tobacco and fishmeal / fish oil, chilli meal, from India to China. 

 

A workshop was jointly conducted by National Medical Products Administration China, and Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation India, with the objective to train Indian Pharma exporters on the updated regulatory practices of China, on 21st June 2019, at Shanghai, China.

 

The Government of India has also taken various measures to extend support to exporters by facilitating Buyers - Sellers meets between potential Chinese importers and Indian exporters to increase exports of sugar, oil meals, Indian rice and grapes. In addition, Indian exporters are encouraged to participate in major trade fairs in China, to showcase Indian products.

 

Government has been implementing various schemes and programmes to help the domestic industries compete effectively with imports. To promote the domestic manufacturing, schemes like ‘Make in India, ‘Digital India’, Software Technology Parks, Electronics Hardware Technology Park Scheme/ Export Oriented Unit Scheme and Special Economic Zone Scheme provide support for promoting domestic manufacturing in the country.

 

 The Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20 has mechanisms such as Merchandise Exports from India Scheme, Advance Authorisation Scheme, Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme, Interest Equalization Scheme to provide an enabling framework for the businesses to make their exports competitive.  Active interventions, in terms of policy and procedural changes are regularly undertaken by the Government so that the businesses can cope up with the dynamic international trade scenario.

                The Department of Commerce brought out the National Rubber Policy in March 2019. The National Rubber Policy includes several provisions to support the Natural Rubber (NR) production sector and the entire rubber industry value chain.  The Policy covers new planting and replanting of rubber, support for growers, processing and marketing of natural rubber, labour shortage, grower forums, external trade, Centre-State integrated strategies, research, training, rubber product manufacturing and export, climate change concerns and carbon market.

 

National Rubber Policy is based on the short term and long term strategies identified by the Task Force constituted on the rubber sector for mitigating problems faced by rubber growers in the country. The Task Force held extensive consultations with various stakeholders of rubber sector.  Prior to the notification of the National Rubber Policy, stakeholders’ views were obtained. The policy is expected to benefit natural rubber growers and promote the natural rubber production sector.

 

Developmental and research activities for supporting NR sector for the welfare of growers are carried out through Rubber Board by implementing the scheme Sustainable and Inclusive Development of Natural Rubber Sector in the Medium Term Framework (MTF) (2017-18 to 2019-20).  The developmental activities include financial and technical assistance for planting, supply of quality planting materials, support for grower forums, training and skill development programme.

                Startups receiving investments from Ventures Capital Fund are exempt from taxation as per provision of Section 56, (2) (vii b) of Income Tax Act 1961 (Act). Angel Fund is sub category of Ventures Capital Fund under Category-I Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), hence, eligible for the same exemption.  

Several round of discussions have been held by Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT) with the Startup ecosystem to address their concerns. Consequently, a notification number G.S.R. 127(E), dated 19th February, 2019 was issued by DPIIT. Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) vide their notification number S.O. 1131(E) dated 5th March 2019 has notified that provisions of Section 56 (2) vii(b) of Act shall not apply to consideration received by a company for issue of shares that exceeds the face value of such shares, if the said consideration has been received from a person, being a resident, by a company which fulfils the conditions specified in notification number G.S.R. 127(E), dated 19th February, 2019 of DPIIT. 

Department of Revenue had earlier issued an advisory on 24th December, 2018 based on representations received from various startup companies that no coercive measures to recover the outstanding amount should be taken for startup companies, if additions have been made by Assessing Officer under Section 56(2) vii(b) of Income Tax Act, 1961 after modifying /rejecting evaluation so furnished under Rule 11 UA (2) of Income Tax Rule, 1962.

The provisions of the notification number G.S.R. 127(E) dated 19th February 2019 have been fully implemented, easing norms for providing tax relief to Startups on angel investments.

DPIIT accepts applications and declarations from Startups applying for Angel Tax Exemption and on the receipt of the same DPIIT forwards these applications to CBDT. As on 21st June, 2019 a total of 944 applications for Angel Tax Exemption have been received. Thirty-nine applications have been found to be incomplete, and 203 applications were repeat or modified applications. CBDT has exempted 702 startups under this provision.

                The State Reforms proposed by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) requires States and Union Territories (UTs) to have a Single Window System across various Departments with the following features:

i.     Allow online submission of application without the need to submit physical copies of the application.

ii.    Eliminate physical touch-point for document submission and verification.

iii.   Allow applicant to track status of application online.

iv.   Ensure the applicant receives an SMS/e-mail notification as and when the application is submitted and/or query is raised and/or application is approved/rejected.

v.    Service wise approvals may be granted as and when received from the Department concerned.

vi. Mandate that all queries/clarifications related to investors' application are sought in one go and within 7 days of receipt of the application.

Under the assessment exercise of States/UTs for the year 2017-18, 21 States/UTs have designed and implemented online Single Window System.

                Review of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy is an ongoing process and changes are made in the FDI policy regime, from time to time, to ensure that India remains an attractive investment destination. 

FDI in various sectors is allowed in a calibrated manner after having intensive consultations with stakeholders including concerned Ministries and Departments, State Governments, apex industry chambers, associations and other organizations taking into consideration their views and comments.  FDI policy on various sectors, indicating therein sector-wise FDI limits is, provided in the ‘Consolidated FDI Policy Circular of 2017’, as amended from time to time through subsequent Press Notes, which are available on the website of Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade at www.dipp.gov.in.

While FDI policy lays down an enabling framework for attracting foreign investment, Ministry of Home Affairs has laid down detailed guidelines for assessment of proposals from national security point of view. In order to boost economic growth without compromising the security of the country, proposals are evaluated on the basis of their potential threat to nation’s unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty.

                Developmental and research activities for supporting natural rubber sector for the welfare of growers are carried out by Rubber Board through the scheme “Sustainable and Inclusive Development of Natural Rubber Sector” in the Medium Term Framework (MTF) (2017-18 to 2019-20).  The development activities include financial and technical assistance for planting, supply of quality planting materials, support for grower forums and training and skill development programme.  

Natural Rubber (NR) prices have been at relatively low levels during the recent years in domestic and international markets.  The domestic NR prices are highly sensitive to import of NR.  Hence, to regulate the import of NR, the Government has increased the duty on import of dry rubber from “20% or Rs. 30 per kg whichever is lower” to “25% or Rs. 30 per kg whichever is lower” with effect from 30.4.2015 in order to create demand for locally produced rubber. The Government has also reduced the period of utilization of imported dry rubber under advance licensing scheme from 18 months to 6 months.

                A draft National e-Commerce policy has been prepared and placed in public domain. This policy addresses six broad areas of the e-commerce ecosystem viz. data, infrastructure development, e-commerce marketplaces, regulatory issues, stimulating domestic digital economy and export promotion through e-commerce. The Policy takes into account interests of all stakeholders, like investors, manufacturers, MSMEs, traders, retailers, startups and consumers. 

The FDI Policy on e-commerce, first pronounced through Press Note 2 of 2000, permitted 100% FDI in B2B e-commerce activities. With a view to clarify already existing policy framework, after extensive stakeholder consultations, Press Note 3 was issued by DPIIT in 2016. B2C e-commerce, that is multi-brand retail through inventory based model, has all along remained prohibited for FDI. Through the Press Note 2 (2018) issued on 26 December, 2018 Government has only reiterated the policy provisions to ensure better implementation of the Policy in letter and spirit, without making any change in the underlying principle.

In response to the draft Policy, comments of a number of foreign governments have been received, including the US Government flagging issues of US businesses.

This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.

The Conference cum International Buyers Sellers Meet was inaugurated by Anup Wadhawan, Commerce Secretary, Government of India. Paban Kumar Borthakur, Chairman APEDA, J.C. Ramthanga, Principal Secretary, Horticulture and Soil Conservation, Government of Manipur and other senior officers and delegates from India and abroad were present on this occasion. 

Chairman APEDA in his welcome address said that India’s total agricultural product exports is valued at 38 billion USD for the financial year 2017-18, out of which 50% is contributed through APEDA’s products. He also informed that APEDA has been organising international buyers-sellers meet for different products in different parts of the country.

Commerce Secretary in his inaugural speech congratulated the organisers for arranging a programme of this scale. He further said that the North East Region (NER) is diverse and has huge potential that can be capitalised considering its agricultural and horticultural produce, strategic location, neighbouring the South East Asian countries, and can offer big opportunities for trade and economic activity to the farmers of the region and help double their income.

This conference in Imphal provided a platform for B2B and B2G meetings with international buyers, exporters and progressive farmers / growers to explore opportunities and prospects from the North East Region particularly from Manipur.

20 international buyers from South East Asia, Gulf countries and neighbouring countries participated in this event and interacted with Indian exporters. Apart from the importers and exporters, progressive farmers / growers groups from NER also participated in the event and interacted with the exporters to find out prospects and requirements of buyer countries. Exporters and growers showcased products of the North East like pineapple, black rice, organic products, fresh fruits, vegetables, flowers and spices. 

APEDA, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, promotes export of agricultural and processed food products from India. In its endeavour to promote export of agricultural products from NER, APEDA has been organising various buyers- sellers meets to facilitate market linkages of the exporters with international buyers. The first international buyers – sellers meet for NER was organized by APEDA in Guwahati in March this year.

APEDA is conducting regular promotional activities in the area of agriculture exports. It provides support to exporters to set up infrastructure like pack houses and cold storages. APEDA also helps exporters to exhibit their products in several national and international expos and exhibitions. The Imphal event of international buyers - sellers meet is part of the initiative of APEDA to bring the North-Eastern states of India on the export map of the country.

                Commerce and Industry Minister, Piyush Goyal, along with Ministers of State, Hardeep Singh Puri and Som Parkash, held an interactive session till late evening yesterday with e-Commerce companies to discuss ways to bring about convergence of interests of e-Commerce platforms and small retailers. The session was also an exercise by DPIIT to understand specific issues related to e-Commerce platforms, including sectors like services, food and used goods. 

Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways, Piyush Goyal, has directed Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) to immediately form a committee headed by Additional Secretary in DPIIT, with representatives of Department of Commerce, Ministries of MSME, Consumers Affairs and legal experts from Government as members. The committee will hear grievances and provide necessary clarifications on issues related to FDI in e-Commerce. 

Commerce and Industry Minister reiterated that the Government will ensure that small retailers and kirana shops thrive in the country. The Minister informed that Commerce and Industry Ministry is making all efforts to balance the interests of small businesses, retailers, kirana shop owners and e-Commerce companies, and he will again hold a meeting after a month. 

During the interaction, Commerce and Industry Minister said that the e-Commerce policy is work in progress and he assured that enough time will be given to all stakeholders to adapt to any changes that may be required. More importantly, the changes will be prospective and nothing will be implemented with retrospective effect. He urged e-Commerce companies to always honor the spirit as well as letter of the law.     

Piyush Goyal also informed that the Ministry will look at ways of facilitating sale of India’s handicraft and handlooms through e-Commerce platforms. He especially emphasised on export promotion through e-Commerce platforms.

Commerce and Industry Minister was of the view that even as the interests of MSMEs and other small retailers are protected, India will continue to embrace technology and digitalization to take the economy forward.

Founders, CEOs and other senior executives of around 25 e-Commerce companies expressed their views in this interaction with the Commerce and Industry Minister.

                Some Developed Countries including European Union (EU) provide unilateral tariff preferences on exports from developing countries/least developing country under their Generalised System of Preferences(GSP) Scheme. 

 

USA has terminated preferential tariff benefits being granted to India under its Generalized System of Preferences scheme from June 5, 2019. India exported goods worth of USD 6.3 billion(as per USTR data) to U.S. under the GSP programme during the calendar year 2018, which was12.1% of India’s total export to U.S in that year. The total duty concessions accruing on account of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) were USD 240 million in 2018 which was about 3.8% of the value of India’s exports to the US availing GSP benefits in 2018. Issues related to dairy products and medical devices were part of the GSP review instituted by the US, which led to the above outcome. These concessions will no longer be available. 

 

The impact will vary across products depending on the individual product concessions constituting the average tariff concession of 3.8% of the value of the India’s export to the US availing GSP benefits, and other factors specific to each product. Indian industry is competitive in their export products and we do not foresee significant impact on our foreign trade.

 

Trade related issues are a part of any ongoing economic relationship, and will continue to be discussed and addressed as a part of the regular bilateral trade engagement between India the US.

                India’s exports have faced a very challenging period in recent years, on account of developments arising from the global financial crisis of 2008-09, which accentuated after 2013-14, when the world economy experienced a major trade slowdown. Thus, after achieving a turnaround from the initial shock, exports came under immense pressure again in the post 2013-14 period due to accentuation of the global economic and financial crisis in the second phase when countries like China also got adversely affected. However, since then exports have been growing on a secular basis since 2016-17 for almost three years and total exports reached a new peak of more than half a trillion dollars, for the first time.

Government has taken following key measures for promotion of exports: 

 


	A new Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-20 was launched on 1st April 2015. The policy, inter alia, rationalised the earlier export promotion schemes and introduced two new schemes, namely Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) for improving export of goods and ‘Services Exports from India Scheme (SEIS)’ for increasing exports of services. Duty credit scrips issued under these schemes were made fully transferable.
	The Mid-term Review of the FTP 2015-20 was undertaken on 5th December, 2017. Incentive rates for labour intensive / MSME sectors were increased by 2% with a financial implication of Rs 8,450 crore per year. 
	A new Logistics Division was created in the Department of Commerce to coordinate integrated development of the logistics sector.  India’s rankin World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index moved up from 54 in 2014 to 44 in 2018.
	Interest Equalization Scheme on pre and post shipment rupee export credit was introduced from 1.4.2015 providing interest equalisation at 3% for labour intensive MSME sectors. The rate was increased to 5% for MSME sectors with effect from 2.11.2018 and merchant exporters were covered under the scheme with effect from 2.1.2019. 
	Various measures for improving ease of doing business were taken. India’s rank in World Bank ‘Ease of doing business’ ranking improved from 142 in 2014 to 77 in 2018 with the rank in ‘trading across borders’ moving up from 122 to 80.
	A new scheme called “Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES)” was launched with effect from 1st April 2017 to address the export infrastructure gaps in the country.
	A comprehensive “Agriculture Export Policy” was launched on 6th December, 2018 with an aim to double farmers’ income by 2022 and provide an impetus to agricultural exports.
	A new scheme called “Transport and Marketing Assistance” (TMA) scheme has been launched for mitigating disadvantage of higher cost of transportation for export of specified agriculture products.   
	A new scheme called Scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) covering export of garments and made-ups was notified on 7.3.2019 providing refund of duties/taxes at higher rates.

                Direct funding support to startups is not envisaged under Startup India Programme. Government of India has established Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS), to meet the funding needs of startups. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Government of India, is the monitoring agency and Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) is the operating agency for FFS.

As per the operating guidelines issued by DPIIT, FFS contributes to the corpus of SEBI registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). These AIFs in turn have to invest at least twice the contribution under FFS in startups, as defined by the Government of India. Each AIF sets up its own Investment Committee and the investment Committee of each Fund takes a decision on its investment decisions. The AIFs supported under FFS have supported 249 startups as on June 13, 2019.

The investment committee (IC) of each AIF, comprising of investment experts drawn from different domains takes decisions on investing into particular startup. These decisions are largely a matter of business decisions which depend on a host of factors like uniqueness, innovativeness, intellectual property and business potential.

A formal mechanism has been put in place in the form of Monitoring Committee to review progress of Startup India programme on regular basis. The Monitoring Committee comprises representative from DPIIT, NITI Aayog, Department of Revenue (Ministry of Finance), Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Department of Science and Technology (Ministry of Science and Technology), Department of Bio-Technology (Ministry of Science and Technology), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Department of Higher Education (Ministry of Human Resources Development) and Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). The Monitoring Committee continuously reviews progress & implementation of various measures for growth of startup ecosystem.

Year wise figures for number of Startups provided financial assistance are given below:

Some of the major indicator wise reforms undertaken by the Government towards easing the business environment in the country are as under: 

 

(i)         Starting A Business: 

 


	The minimum capital requirement for public and private company has been eliminated under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2015.
	Introduced a single form SPICe (Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company electronically) by merging five different applications in it i.e. Name reservation, Company incorporation, Director Identification Number  (DIN), Permanent Account Number (PAN) and the Tax Deduction/Collection Account Number (TAN).
	Introduced an e-form AGILE (Application for registration of the Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN), Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) registration plus Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) registration). Any applicant, if he wants to register for any of these bodies, can fill in e-form AGILE and get registration at the time of company incorporation itself. This form enables a user to apply for GST, EPF and ESI registration with the SPICe form.
	Launch of a new and simplified web based service i.e. R.U.N. (Reserve Unique Name) for reserving a name. This has also removed the requirement to use a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) during name reservation.
	Incorporation fee reduced to zero for companies with authorized capital up to INR 15 lakhs
	The requirement to issue a physical PAN card has been eliminated. Additionally, PAN and TAN are mentioned in the Certificate of Incorporation (CoI) which is considered as a sufficient proof for PAN and TAN.
	Online and common registration for EPFO & ESIC is provided on ShramSuvidha Portal.
	Registrations under Mumbai Shops & Establishments Act are provided in real time without any cost and any inspection
	Eliminated the requirement of bank account details for GST registration


 

(ii)        Dealing with Construction Permits:  

 


	An online single window system has been introduced in Delhi (By Municipal Corporations in Delhi) and Mumbai (By Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) integrating internal and external departments, removing requirement of visiting them individually.
	Unified building bye-laws 2016 have been introduced in Delhi.
	Deemed approvals have been introduced in Delhi, if approvals are not granted within defined timelines.
	Risk based classification of buildings has been introduced for fast tracking building plan approval, inspection and grant of occupancy-cum-completion certificate.
	Requirement of submitting notarized certificates or affidavits for building plan approval has been replaced with e-undertaking in Delhi.
	Multiple inspections at completion stage have been replaced by single joint inspection in Delhi.
	Road cutting and restoration for water and sewer connections have been simplified.


 

(iii)       Getting Electricity: 

 


	Procedures for internal wiring inspection by the Electrical Inspectorate (in Delhi) have been eliminated.
	In Delhi, service line charges have been capped to INR 25,000/- in electrified areas for Low Tension loads up to 150 KW.
	Time taken by the utility to carry out external connection works has been reduced in Delhi.


 


	Getting Credit :


 


	Secured creditors are paid first during business liquidation, and hence have priority over other claims such as labor and tax. 


 


	Paying Taxes: 


 


	17 indirect Central and State taxes have been replaced with a single indirect tax, Goods and Service Tax (GST), for the entire country. The previous sales taxes including the central sales tax, CENVAT, state VAT and the service tax have been merged into the GST. Unification of these taxes will reduce the cascading effect of taxes and make taxes paid on inputs creditable to a higher percentage.
	Corporate income tax has been reduced from 30% to 25% for companies with a turnover up to INR 250 crore.
	Electronic System for payment of Social Security Contributions has been introduced enabling easier return payment.
	Making payment of EPF has been made mandatory electronically.
	Administrative charges on The Employees' Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 (EPFS) have been reduced in March 2017 from 0.85% to 0.65% of the monthly pay. The Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) administrative charges of 0.01% have been removed.


 


	     Trading Across Borders: 


 


	Time and cost to export and import has been reduced through various initiatives, including the implementation of electronic sealing of containers, upgradation of port infrastructure and allowing electronic submission of supporting documents with digital signatures.
	Enhancement of risk-based inspections for both imports and exports, whereby only about 5% of goods are physically inspected.
	Advance Bill of Entry has been adopted which allows importers to start the process of customs clearance before the arrival of the vessel.
	Equipment on the NhavaSheva Port in Mumbai has been upgraded by adding 15 new Rubber Tyre Gantry Cranes. The Phase 1 of the Fourth Container Terminal at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, with an additional annual capacity of 2,400,000 TEUs, was completed in February 2018.
	The new container terminal, Adani CMA Mundra Terminal Private Limited has been fully operational since June 2017, with an additional annual capacity of 1,300,000 TEUs.
	e-Sanchit, an online application system, under the Single Window Interface for Trade (SWIFT) has been implemented. It allows traders to submit all supporting documents electronically with digital signatures.


 


	Enforcing Contracts


 


	National Judicial Data Grid has been introduced which makes it possible to generate case measurement report on local courts. 
	The Commercial Courts Act 2015 has been amended to reduce the pecuniary jurisdiction of commercial courts from INR 1 crore to INR 3 lakhs to establish commercial courts at the District Level. This will help in speedier disposal of commercial disputes and reduce pendency.


 


	Resolving Insolvency


 


	Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 has been adopted that introduced a reorganization procedure for corporate debtors and facilitated continuation of the debtors’ business during insolvency proceedings.
	Professional institutions have been established for effective handling of restructuring and insolvency proceedings.
	Time-bound resolution process is done under the IBC and liquidation is the last resort.
	 Section 42 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code 2016 has been amended to provide that a creditor has the right to object to decisions of the liquidator accepting or rejecting claims against the debtor brought by the creditor itself and by any other creditor.

                The National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB), India’s national accreditation body, secured international equivalence for its accreditation programme for personnel certification bodies in the annual meetings of the Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation in Singapore today. NABCB signed the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) of the Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC) for its accreditation programme based on international standard, ISO/IEC 17024. ISO/IEC 17024: Conformity assessment - General requirements for bodies operating certification of persons specifies criteria for the operation of a Personnel Certification Bodies (also known as a certification body for persons). The standard includes requirements for the development and maintenance of the certification schemes for persons upon which the certification is based.

With the above recognition, NABCB hopes to facilitate export of Indian services and skills into the world market by attesting that persons are certified following international standards by the certifying bodies.

Personnel Certification would support many professionals in India, especially thosewho do not have formal education or certificate programme. Any person carrying ISO/IEC 17024 certificate with NABCB logo will be recognized internationally. It can also be used by regulators for establishing confidence in certified personnel for different activities. 

NABCB, a constituent Board of the Quality Council of India, an autonomous body attached to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, is responsible for accreditation of certification/inspection bodies as per applicable international standards under an international system of equivalence. This signifies that the accreditation of personnel certification bodies by NABCB is now accepted as equivalent at international level. 

Accreditation reduces risk for business and its customers by assuring that accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) are competent to carry out the work they undertake within their scope of accreditation. Accreditation Bodies (ABs) that are members of APAC and the CABs they accredit are required to comply with appropriate international standards and the applicable APAC application documents for the consistent application of those standards. ABs that are signatories to the APAC Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MRA) are evaluated regularly by an appointed team of peers to provide confidence in the operation of their accreditation programmes. Accreditation has become an essential tool for getting acceptance of inspection, testing and certification done in India internationally and it is referenced in many bilateral Free Trade Agreements like the India – Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement in which NABCB accreditation is a requirement for certification of electrical/electronic and telecom products. 

NABCB has currently accredited one certification body for Personnel Certification and has 4 applicants. This programme will help professionals to get certified based on their competence in any required field. NABCB is already supporting Ministry of AYUSH and has accredited a certification body for certification for Yoga professionals. This would promote Yoga certification scheme internationally.

                Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways, Piyush Goyal, held a meeting with representatives of associations of kirana stores, traders and retailers in New Delhi today. Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State of Commerce and Industry and Som Parkash, Minister of State of Commerce and Industry were also present during this interaction. 

Piyush Goyal interacted with the representatives in order to engage them for discussions on issues of e-Commerce and explore the strengths and weaknesses of small traders. The Minister also looked at the possibilities of small stores, traders and retailers who may benefit from an e-Commerce platform. He urged small traders and retailers to come on the GeM platform which has achieved Rs. 25000 crore turn over.  

Commerce and Industry Minister urged the participants to speak frankly and put before him all their apprehensions and fears so that the Commerce and Industry Ministry and other Government Departments may be able to address them. 

Representatives of the associations of kirana stores, traders and retailers discussed the need for a level playing field and the impact of anti-competitive practices like predatory pricing and other discriminatory methods that are being faced by them from foreign competition. 

Commerce and Industry Minister again reiterated that India will not allow multi-brand retail by foreign companies and on the pretext of B2B no entry will be allowed for multi-brand retail. Commerce Minister assured the participants that each and every point made by them will be taken up. He also asserted that predatory pricing will not be allowed and necessary action will be taken against defaulters.  Piyush Goyal further said that the Government of India will give all support and assistance to small traders and retailers to grow their business.

Piyush Goyal further said that the aspect of data in the law is being addressed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). He requested the representatives of associations of kirana stores, traders and retailers to send all suggestions for the draft e-Commerce policy in the next five days without any delay. The e-Commerce policy will be finalized only after taking into account every suggestion received by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), said the Minister. 

Piyush Goyal urged small retailers, kirana stores to make use of modern technology and avail benefits of Government of India schemes like MUDRA to improve their business, spruce up their shops, improve stocks by storing high quality products and pass on the benefits to people employed by them. 

Minister explained that by bringing in greater controls through rules and laws will only help up to a certain point, but for long term gain, short term pain will have to be borne and India cannot remain in isolation and will have to be part of the global value chain in order to become a USD 5 trillion economy.

                The Intersessional meeting of Kimberley Process (KP) is being hosted by India from 17th to 21st June, 2019 in Mumbai. Besides meetings of different Working Groups and Committees of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), two special forums regarding Diamond Terminology and Artisanal Mining – Small Steps to Larger Outcomes, will be held during the Intersessional. Around 300 delegates from the Government of India and other participating countries, industry and civil society will be attending the five-day Meeting. 

India and the KPCS

India is one of the founder members of Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and is the Chair of Kimberley Process for the year 2019 with Russian Federation as Vice Chair. India had earlier chaired KPCS in the year 2008. Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi, Director General, Directorate General of Foreign Trade, has been designated as KP Chair 2019 and Rupa Dutta, Economic Adviser, Department of Commerce, is India’s KP Focal Point.

At present, KPCS has 55 members representing 82 countries including EU with 28 members. The Kimberley Process is chaired, on a rotating basis, by participating countries. KP Vice-Chair is generally elected by KP Plenary each year, who becomes the Chair in the next year. 

Since 2003, India has been actively participating in the KPCS process and is a member of all Working Groups of KP (except for Working Group on Artisanal and Alluvial Production, WGAAP).  Department of Commerce is the nodal Department and Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) is designated as the KPCS Importing and Exporting Authority in India. GJEPC is responsible for issuing KP Certificates and is also the custodian of KP Certificates received in the country. 

The Kimberley Process is a joint initiative involving Government, international diamond industry and civil society to stem the flow of Conflict Diamonds. Conflict Diamonds means rough diamonds used by rebel movements or their allies to finance conflict aimed at undermining legitimate governments.  It is also described in United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions. 

In 1998, certain rebel movements in Africa (Sierra Leone, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia) were selling, among other things, illegally obtained diamonds – known as Conflict Diamonds – to fund their wars against legitimate governments. With a view to find ways to stop trade in Conflict Diamonds, world’s diamond industry, United Nations, Governments and leading NGOs came together and in November 2002 at Interlaken, Switzerland, where the final draft of the Kimberley Process measures was ratified by more than fifty countries. The KPCS came into effect from 1st January, 2003 and evolved into an effective mechanism for stopping the trade in Conflict Diamonds. 

Functioning of KPCS

In accordance with the KP core document, the work of the Kimberley Process is carried out through the following six Working Groups and Committees:-


	Working Group on Monitoring (WGM) - Assigned the task of carrying out a review of the working of the scheme in each participant country through review visit/review missions and gives its recommendations.
	Working Group on Statistics (WGS) - Collects data in respect of export, import and production of rough diamonds in the participant countries.
	Working Group on Diamond Experts (WGDE) - Solves technical problems in the implementation of the KPCS like proposing changes to the ‘Harmonised System Codes' for rough diamonds to World Customs Organisation and harmonisation of valuation methodologies.
	Working Group on Artisanal and Alluvial Production (WGAAP) - To promote more effective internal controls on the production and trade of alluvial diamonds.
	Committee on Participation and Chairmanship (CPC) - Assists the Chair of the Kimberley Process in handling the admission of new participants and advises if a participant fail to comply with minimum requirements. It also reviews and assesses candidates for the position of Vice-Chair and presents its recommendation/findings at the plenary meeting.  The participant selected as Vice-Chair becomes Chair the following year.
	Committee on Rules and Procedure (CRP) - KP rules and procedure are devised and modified by the Committee.


In addition, an Ad Hoc Committee on Review and Reform (AHCRR) was created in Brisbane, Australia, Plenary of KPCS in 2017, with India as its Chair, to review the KPCS core document and examine ways to enhance administrative and financial support to the Process, including consideration of a Secretariat and a voluntary multi-donor fund to support participation from Least Developed Countries, civil society and experts who implement the work. During the Belgium Plenary 2018, India relinquished chairmanship of AHCRR in view of taking responsibility of KP Chair 2019 and Angola was selected as Chair and Canada as Vice Chair of AHCRR.

The working groups and committees discuss issues on regular basis through teleconferences and exchange of mails, and meet twice in a year for in-person meeting at Intersessional and Plenary meetings organized by KP Chair. Further, based on requirement, other in-person meetings may also be organized by Working Group Chair. The KPCS works on principle of consensus and all the decisions are taken in Plenary session or through written procedure unanimously by all members. 

Rough diamond trading under the KPCS

As per the Scheme, each shipment of rough diamonds being exported and imported by crossing an international border be transported in a tamper proof container and accompanied by a validated Kimberley Process Certificate. The shipment can only be exported to a co-participant country in the KPCS. No uncertified shipments of rough diamonds are permitted to enter a participant country. 

The Plenary meeting of Kimberley Process is scheduled to be held from 11th to 15th November, 2019 in New Delhi.

The MSME sector steel manufacturers urged steel producers to supply raw material at concessional prices so that the MSME sector can compete in international markets. 

The meeting was attended by Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, Faggansingh Kulaste, MoS Steel, Secretary Steel, Binoy Kumar, Secretary Commerce, Anup Wadhawan, DGFT, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi, senior officers of Department of Commerce and Steel Ministry, Chairman SAIL, all members of EEPCs, Indian Steel Association, steel makers and manufacturers and other associations of the steel sector.

Commerce & Industry Minister attending Ministerial Meeting on Trade and Investment and Digital Economy in Japan 

Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal, held a series of bilateral talks with a number of countries on the side lines of the two day G20 Ministerial on Trade and Digital Economy in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan on 8-9 June, 2019. 

During the bilateral meetings with host Japan and countries like USA, UK, China, France, Singapore, Korea, Spain, Canada, EU, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Chile and Australia, Piyush Goyal emphasized the need for reciprocal market access for Indian products.

He said that the slowdown in global trade and investment is of serious concern to all of usas it adversely affects economic growth,development and job creation. He called for de-escalating trade tensions and reviving confidence in the rules based multilateral trading system which all countries had so painstakingly created. 

The Commerce Minister said that while India is committed to working towards building free trade, that is inclusive and development centric to bring prosperity to people around the world, focus on the imperatives of meeting the goals of SDGs, and eliminating poverty and deprivationmust not be lost.

He further reiterated that with the advent of digital technologies, services are vital drivers of growth. Servicification of the manufacturing sector is enhancing the importance of services in global trade. Major investment is also being driven by the services sector. Thus, we need to remove barriers and facilitate temporary movement of highly skilled professionals to sustain this investment and growth.

Piyush Goyal pointed out another way to go about correcting this, is by supporting greater participation of MSMEs in developing countries both in domestic and global trade, because they are crucial for jobs and income generation, on which livelihood of millions are dependent. India urges G20 to provide preferentialmarket access to MSMEs in developing countries to be part of the Global supply chains. 

At the end of the 2 day sessions Commerce Minister congratulated Japanfor taking initiative of putting fortha forward looking agenda,ofthe growing interface, between Trade and Digital Economy.For the first time a joint session with ministers of digital economy and trade and investment was held in G20 to discuss the interface between digital economy and trade. The Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways represented India in both the Joint sessions.

In his address PiyushGoyal said that there is no doubt that digital technologies are impacting our economies in a significant way and nations that fail to adapt to these changing realities run the risk of being left behind. Technologies can be disruptive if not harnessed in right time. The Minister further said that concerns over loss of jobs, revenue, erosion of competitiveness are real. 

The deliberations on trade, investment and digital economy will feed into the Osaka Summit Declaration which will be adopted on 29th June, 2019.

                Commerce and  Industry Minister PiyushGoyal held a detailed meeting with Chairman and Managing Director SBI, MD Export Credit Guarantee Corporation, MD EXIM bank and other public sector, private and foreign banks along with FIEO and other export promotion councils and industry bodies for exploring ways and means for easier availability of credit to exporters at competitive rates. Ministers of State for Commerce and Industry,HardeepPuriand  SomParkash also participated in the deliberations. 

Commerce and Industry Minister emphasized that India needs to aspire for a export target of USD one trillion each for goods and services and for that it is the joint responsibility of government, financial institutions and industry to ensure that export credit at competitive rates is available to business. We need to achieve a much higher level of export credit from the present level of 9.5 lakh crore. There is a need for a quantum jump if we want to achieve our export targets. In this regard, he asked RBI, ECGC, EXIM and SBI to explore regulatory reforms, innovative financial instruments and rationalizing credit disbursal procedures. 

Commerce and Industry Minister stated that exporters should be able to take more and more export credit in foreign currency. Its share in total export credit should increase from the present level of about 50%. RBI was also asked to explore the possibility of use of its foreign exchange reserves for providing a line of credit for swap to good banks for this purpose resulting in cheaper foreign currency loan. ECGC was asked to enable a credit guarantee cover for foreign currency lending to MSMEs. EXIM bank may provide refinance in foreign currency to the commercial banks to support exports credit particularly to MSMEs. ECGC should also extend export factoring for MSMEs. 

Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) and other export promotion councils and industry bodies raised various issues including bank coverage charges, issues in exports to Iran, processing fee issues, collateral requirements and issues in loan disbursals. Many of the issues were immediately resolved with the intervention of the Commerce and Industry Minister. He requested the financial institutions and the departments concerned to take note of the remaining issues and come up with solutions in a time bound manner. FIEO was asked to submit a report on simplification of export credit procedures by 30th June, 2019.

Commerce and Industry Minister also decided to have a follow up meeting on June 30, 2019 in Mumbai to review the progress on the action items identified in the meeting.

The meeting was attended by the representatives of the Department of Economic Affairs, Department of Financial Services, Commerce Secretary, AnupWadhawan, Secretary MSME, Dr. Arun Kumar Panda, Director General of Foreign Trade, AlokVardhanChaturvedi , officials from RBI, State Bank of India, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Barclays Bank, Citi India, Bank of America, EXIM Bank, ECGC, Indian Banks’ Association, FIEO, EEPC, GJEPC, LaghuUdyogBharati, FICCI and CII.

Union Minister of Commerce and Industrychairing the meeting on issues related to export credit

 

Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways, Piyush Goyal, isholding a meeting in New Delhi today on issues related to export credit with representatives of exporters organisations like FIEO, Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), representatives of exporters organizations, Finance Ministry officials and heads of financial institutions. Ministers of State for Commerce and Industry,Hardeep Singh Puri and Som Parkash, Commerce Secretary, Anup Wadhawan, Secretary MSME, Dr. Arun Kumar Panda, Director General of Foreign Trade, Alok Vardhan Chaturvediand senior officials of the Department of Commerce are also attending the daylong meeting.  

Timely and efficient availability of export credit is critical for any trade activity and is one of the key drivers that boosts growth of export. This was stated by Commerce Minister in his opening address. The time has come when we should move away from subsidies to easy availability of cheaper credit to exporters, the Minister said.

Piyush Goyal informed that in the last few years the share of export credit has come down and this is a cause of concernspecially for the MSME sector that suffers due to demand of collateral from lending institutions.

Commerce Minister informed that today’s meeting with stakeholders has been called to address this significant challenge and to redress the situation based on the inputs given by participating organizations and institutions.

Commerce Minister further said that in order to alleviate the burden on exporters and to make Indian exports competitive and on par with global best practices we have to first develop a framework with a stable policy that is internationally acceptable, consistent and robust and then look for solutions within that framework based on trust, integrity and due diligence. Greater transparency has to be brought into the work being done by Government organizations, export promotion councils and financial institutions. 

The Minister informed that transparency will ensure that the genuine competitive advantages of India’s exports may be harnessed.

Earlier in his opening remarksthe Commerce & Industry Minister recalled the vision of Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, first Minister of Industry of independent India, who laid solid foundation of India’s industrialisation through the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948. He highlighted that this time, meeting with Industry has been combined with the meeting with States in order to have holistic discussion in the true spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism. He emphasised that Industry should move away from the mindset of government support and  subsidy because there are larger issues which need to be addressed at a structural level . He urged the industry to focus on the root cause of the problem and increase our competitiveness in terms of quality and efficiency. He assured the industry that wherever there are genuine difficulties like increased cost of credit, easy availability of liquidity etc, will be resolved expeditiously.  He highlighted the achievements of the government in terms of exports crossing half trillion mark for the first time with goods exports at all time high of USD 331 billion, “Ease of doing business” rank improving to 77 and logistics rank improving to 44th.  Procurement of more than Rs 25,000 crorehave been undertaken by Governments resulting in huge savings.

                The Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways, Piyush Goyal, is leading the Indian delegation for the G20 Ministerial meeting on Trade and Digital Economy being held on 8th – 9th June, 2019 in Tsukuba city, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. 

The Indian Commerce Minister will discuss developments in the global trade situation, WTO matters and digital trade. He will also hold dialogue with other participating Trade Ministers on current international trade and investments. For the first time Ministers of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and Commerce will participate in a joint session on Digital Economy at the G20Ministerial Meeting.

The G20Trade Ministers deliberations will form part of the G20Summit Leaders agenda in the formal discussions and will also be a part of the Summit Declaration. 

Ever since G20 was formedIndia has been actively participating in the meetings. Although there are no binding commitments in G20, it sets the agenda for multilateral trade relations.

In his first visit abroad after assuming charge, Piyush Goyal will take this opportunity to interact with various trade ministers of participating countries including host Japan. Commerce Minister will hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines of G20 in order to sensitize India’s core interests in trade and investment issues and build coalition with likeminded countries for defending the interests of developing countries. 

Over 50 Trade and Digital Economy Ministers will get together for the first time in G20 history in Tsukuba, Japan, to discuss how G20 economies can promote trade and investment and maximize benefits from the development of the digital economy and technologies to ensure sustainable growth of the global economy. 

Digitalization is expected to continue to create benefits for our economies and societies as a whole and help achieve the inclusive, innovative and human-centred future society - “Society 5.0”. 

However, the global economic and social system faces considerable challenges. Rapid globalization has led some to believe that they are not benefiting sufficiently and are discontent. It is hoped that the G20Ministerial Meeting being held in Japanwill play a positive role in fostering economic opportunity and addressing challenges in the global landscape. Trade and investment have been important drivers of the unprecedented global economic growth and poverty reduction enjoyed in recent times. 

The Trade and Digital Economy meeting is one of the 8 Ministerial meetings taking place in Japan alongside the 2019 G20 Summit. The other seven Ministerial meetings are Agriculture Ministers’, Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ meeting, Labour and Employment Ministers’ meeting, Tourism Ministers meeting, Ministerial meeting on Energy Transitions and Global Environment for Sustainable Growth, Health Ministers’ meeting and Foreign Ministers’ meeting 

G20 is made up of 19 countries and the European Union(EU). The 19 countries are: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The G20 members represent two-thirds of the world’s people and 85 percent of its economy.

Piyush Goyal addressing joint meeting of the Board of Trade and the Council of Trade Development

 

Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways, Piyush Goyal, has urged the representatives of industry and exports bodies to stop depending on crutches of subsidies and grants from the Central Government and strive to make industry more competitive and self-reliant. 

Addressing a joint meeting of the Board of Trade and the Council of Trade Development and Promotion organized by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in New Delhi today the Commerce Minister asserted that when subsidies have been done away with, businesses grew. In this context, he gave the example of manufacturing of LED bulbs which are now available at affordable rates in the market due to higher production. 

Commerce Minister further explained that when production takes place on a large scale, domestic manufacturing and business grows which leads to import substitution and also improves quality of products. 

Piyush Goyal also urged State Governments, Export Promotion Councils and industrial bodies to make all efforts to engage with the world from a position of strength. He said that every country is willing to invest in India so that they may benefit from the huge market opportunity in India. Commerce Minister said that the time for incremental growth targets has ended and India now needs to leapfrog in order to improve its global standing and ensure that the benefits of growth reach the last citizen at the bottom of the pyramid. He called upon all stakeholders to work as a team for the development of the country. The Minister appreciated the roles played by former Commerce and Industry Ministers, Nirmala Sitharaman and Suresh Prabhu for their focused efforts to promote business and industry and increase exports in the last five years.  

Piyush Goyal further said that India and the world are now going through challenging times due to trade barriers and falling economic growth therefore there is greater need for focused efforts to maintain our position and grow in world trade. This forum provides opportunity to work with synergy among all stakeholders so that improvement can be made in the framework, monitoring process for internal trade, industrial growth and exports. All Ministries, Departments of the Government of India and all State Governments have to strive to make mechanisms more transparent and corruption free, said the Commerce Minister. 

The day-long joint meeting is being attended by MoS of Civil Aviation, Housing and Urban Affairs and Commerce & Industry, Hardeep Singh Puri, MoS Commerce & Industry, Som Parkash, CEO NITI Aayog, Secretaries of Departments of Commerce, Revenue, Shipping, Road Transport and Highways, Civil Aviation, Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Agriculture, Information Technology, Textiles, MSME and other Ministries of Government of India, representatives of State Governments, heads of industrial houses, representatives of Export Promotion Councils and academia.

The Board of Trade advises the Commerce and Industry Ministry on policy measures connected with the Foreign Trade Policy in order to achieve the objectives of boosting India’s trade. 

The Council for Trade Development and Promotion ensures the continuous dialogue with State Governments and Union Territories on measures for providing an international trade enabling environment in the States and to create a framework for making the states active partners in boosting India’s export.

                The United States of America (USA) has w.e.f. 5 June 2019 withdrawn India’s GSP benefits. These are unilateral, non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory benefits extended by some developed countries to developing countries. India as part of our bilateral trade discussions, had offered resolution on significant US requests in an effort to find a mutually acceptable way forward. It is unfortunate that this did not find acceptance by the US. India, like the US and other nations shall always uphold its national interest in these matters. We have significant development imperatives and concerns and our people also aspire for better standards of living. This will remain the guiding factor in the Government’s approach.

 

In any relationship, in particular in the area of economic ties, there are ongoing issues which get resolved mutually from time to time. We view this issue as a part of this regular process and will continue to build on our strong ties with the US, both economic and people-to-people. We are confident that the two Nations will continue to work together intensively for further growing these ties in a mutually beneficial manner.

The Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan today asserted that the Government is going to implement ""One nation-one ration card"" scheme in the whole country by 30th June, 2020. Shri Paswan said, while addressing media in New Delhi that work on linking all the ration cards all over the country with Aadhar cards and organizing food grain distributionmechanism in its entirety throughPoint of Sale (PoS) machine is in the final stage.

Currently Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Tripura are 10 states where 100% POS machines have been arranged for grain distribution and all PDS shops have been connected to the Internet. Now, in these states any beneficiary can take grain from any public distribution system shop in that state.Shri Paswan stated that arrangements are being made to ensure that by August 15, 2019, beneficiaries of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Gujarat and Maharashtra will be able to take ration from anywhere in both states.



The Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution asserted that work is being done on war footing to ensure “One Nation One Ration Card” scheme is implemented across the nation and for that data of all ration cards will be connected to one server and any beneficiary, anywhere in the country, will be able to pick up their grain from any public distribution system of their choice after 30th June, 2020.

Union Minister Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, in arecently held meeting with State Food Secretaries and State government officials along with officials of Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs) on 27th June, reviewed the progress of this work. (Link for PIB press release: http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1576014). Shri Paswanissued instructions to State government officials to ensure thatspecial arrangements were made for distribution of ration to the migrant population within the next two months in some of the major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and other major cities in Maharashtra where the proportion of migrant population is high.

The Minister said work is in the final stage for integrating the entire public distribution system with the Depots online system (DOS)to ensure seamless working of the National Food Security Act and bringing further transparency in the storage and distribution process of food grains.FCI will provide an internet gateway for integrating DOS with State governments within 4 months. After that, within 2 months, States will integrate their Warehouse Management Systems with DOS. The Union Minister issued instructions to the officials of Department of Food and PD to continuously review the progress made in this regard.

Shri Ram Vilas Paswan further stated that the work done by the department of Food and Public Distribution is very important and it is almost a life line for the beneficiaries wherein 612 lakh ton of food grains stored in warehouses of FCI, CWC, SWCs and private godowns are distributed among 81 crore beneficiaries annually. Shri Paswan asserted that focus is on use of Information Technology right from the time of procurement of food grains till its distribution which will help in increasing the overall efficiency of the entire process, while maintaining transparency and curbing corruption.

FCI has implemented the Depot Online System (DOS) in all its 563 warehouses and CWC has implemented it in 144 depots. Apart from this, procurement of food grains by the FCI has also been made online while purchase, storage and distribution system of most States has been made online in some form or the other.

Shri Paswan emphasized that it is imperative that there is a seamless flow of information online between FCI and States and therefore they need to be integrated so that exact information on procurement and distribution across the nation is available. The Union Minister insisted that there should be a system for storage of all such qualitative and quantitative information which can then be accessed through the ‘annavitran’ portal and the specially designed dashboard which he personally monitors in the morning meetings with senior officials of the Ministry.

 



 

Another key announcement was regarding asolutionto the problem of malnutrition.The Food & PD department will be implementing a new Centrally Sponsored Pilot Scheme for “Fortification of Rice and its Distribution under Public Distribution System” which was given administrative approval on 14-Feb-2019.  The Pilot Scheme has been approved with a total budget outlay of Rs.147.61 crores for a period of 3 years beginning 2019-20.  The Pilot Scheme would be funded by Government of India in the ratio of 90:10 in respect of North Eastern, Hilly and Island States and 75:25 in respect of the rest of the States.

The Pilot Scheme will focus on 15 Districts (one District per State).At present, 9 states have agreed to start the scheme and have identified the districts. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Assam. The remaining states have been requested to select the districts and work on implementation of this system by selecting Agency-Mills for rice fortification.

                 Payment of cane price to sugarcane growing farmers by the sugar mills is a continuous process. In sugar season 2017-18, cane dues payable in respect of Uttar Pradesh and on all India basis was Rs. 33013 crores and Rs. 82730 crores respectively. As a result of various measures enumerated in reply to part (c) of the question, the cane dues of farmers on all India basis for previous sugar season 2017-18 have been reduced to only Rs. 303 crores as on 24.06.2019. In respect of Uttar Pradesh the cane price dues have been reduced to only Rs. 49 crores for sugar season 2017-18.

Due to surplus sugar production, during the previous sugar season and the current sugar season, the sugar prices remained depressed which adversely affected the liquidity of the sugar mills resulting in accumulation of cane price arrears of the farmers.

With a view to improve the liquidity position of sugar mills enabling them to clear  cane price arrears of farmers, the Government has taken following measures in sugar seasons 2017-18 and 2018-19.

In order to prevent cash loss and to facilitate sugar mills to clear cane dues of farmers in time, the Government has fixed a Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar w.e.f 07.06.2018 at Rs.29/kg for sale at factory gate in domestic market, below which no sugar mill can sell sugar.  MSP has further been increased to Rs. 31/Kg. w.e.f.  14th February, 2019.

Extending Assistance to sugar mills @Rs.5.50/quintal of cane crushed for sugar season 2017-18 to offset the cost of cane.

 Created buffer stock of 30 LMT for which Government is reimbursing carrying cost towards maintenance of buffer stock. 

Extending Assistance to sugar mills @Rs.13.88/quintal of cane crushed for sugar season 2018-19 to offset the cost of cane. 

Extending Assistance to sugar mills for defraying expenditure towards internal transport, freight, handling and other charges to facilitate export of sugar from the country in sugar season 2018-19. 

Government has also notified new National Policy on Bio-Fuels, 2018 under which sugarcane juice has been allowed for production of ethanol. Further, the Government has fixed remunerative price of ethanol produced from C-Heavy molasses and B-Heavy molasses/sugarcane juice separately for supply under Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme during ethanol season 2018-19.

Extending soft loans to sugar mills through banks for which Government would bear interest subvention @ 7% for one year to clear cane price arrears.

Further, in this regard no objection has been received from any State/UT by the Department.  

Public Distribution System (PDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State/UT Governments. Central Govt. is responsible for procurement, allocation and transportation of foodgrains upto the designated depots of the FCI.  The operational responsibilities for identification of eligible beneficiaries/families, issuance of ration cards to them and maintenance of all record s relating to beneficiaries and distribution of foodgrains, etc. rest with the concerned State/UT Government.

                 In the recent past no specific incident of large scale black marketing of essential commodities has come to the knowledge of the Government. The Essential Commodities Act (EC Act), 1955 and the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, (PBMMSEC Act), 1980 provide the legislative and administrative foundation to control hoarding and blackmarketing of essential commodities. Powers to control hoarding, blackmarketing etc. under these Acts have been delegated to States/ UTs. State/UT Governments are advised/sensitised from time to time to take appropriate action against hoarding & blackmarketing and enforce the two Acts, effectively.

Moving towards One Nation One Ration Card (RC), Integrated Management of PDS creating a Central Repository of RCs which will help in de-duplication & allow National Portability to ensure all beneficiaries especially migrants can access PDS across the nation: Shri Ram Vilas Paswan



 

The Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan met State Food Secretaries and State government officials along with officials of Food Corporation of India (FCI),Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs)in New Delhi today. Shri Paswan discussed various issues pertaining to efficient implementation of national food security act, End to end computerisation, transparency in storage and distribution of food grains and synergising of all FCI depots and CWC and SWC depots with the Depot Online System (DOS).

Addressing the gathering, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan stated that the work done by the department of Food and Public Distribution is very important and it is almost a life line for the beneficiaries wherein 612 lakh ton of food grains stored in warehouses of FCI, CWC, SWCs and private godowns are distributed among 81 crore beneficiaries annually. Shri Paswan asserted that use of Information Technology right from the time of purchase of food grains till its distribution will help in increasing the overall efficiency of the entire process, while maintaining transparency and curbing corruption.

The Union Minister expressed satisfaction over the fact that the Depot Online System (DOS) has been implemented in all warehouses of Food Corporation of India (FCI) and 144 depots of Central Warehousing Corporation and the food grain procurement process of FCI is also beingdone online. Shri Paswan expressed happiness that most States have also made their procurement, storage and distribution processes online in some way or the other.

Shri Paswan emphasised that it is imperative that there is a seamless flow of information online between the FCI and States and therefore they need to be integrated so that exact information about how much food grain has been procured from which mandi, which warehouse it is stored in and for how long and when it has been released for distribution can be available. There should also be information about the quality of food grains at the time of purchase, storage conditions in the warehouse, when it is given to PDS shops and when the shops have distributed it to the beneficiaries. The Union Minister insisted that there should be a system for storage of all such qualitative and quantitative information which can then be accessed through the ‘’annavitaran’’ portal. The Union Minister said that this will help in improving the image of FCI, CWC and SWCs.

The key decision taken in the meeting was that FCI will provide an internet gateway for integrating DOS with State governments within 4 months. After that, within 2 months, States will integrate their Warehouse Management Systems with DOS.The Union Minister issued instructions to the officials of Department of Food and PD to review the progress in 4 months and next meeting in this regard will be held in January, 2020.

Another key decision taken was moving towards One Nation One Ration Card (RC) which will ensure all beneficiaries especially migrants can access PDS across the nation from any PDS shop of their own choice. This will provide freedom to the beneficiaries as they will not be tied to any one PDS shop and reduce their dependence on shop owners and curtail instances of corruption. Integrated Management of PDS (IMPDS) is a system that is already operational in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Tripura wherein a beneficiary can avail his share of food grain from any district in the State. In today’s meeting, other states also assured that IMPDS will be implemented at the earliest. The Department of Food and PD is working on war footing to achieve the objective of One Nation One Ration Card and in the next two months beneficiaries of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will be able to access the PDS shops. The objective of the department is to ensure that this is implemented nationally in a time bound manner. There will also be creation of a Central Repository of all RCs which will help in de-duplication. Shri Paswan asserted that the biggest beneficiary of this will be those migrant labourers who move to other States to seek better job opportunities and will ensure their food security.

                Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) receives complaints regarding quality of ISI marked products. On receipt of such complaints, investigation is carried out at the complainant end as well as at the manufacturer’s end. Based on the outcome, action is taken which inter alia, include stop marking, cancellation/expiry of the Licence and/or replacement of the product to the consumer.

The state-wise list of the complaints received in the last three years is placed at Annexure.

The BIS Act 2016 provides for action when the standard mark is used in relation to an article or process that does not conform to the relevant Indian Standard.

BIS draws market sample for independent testing to check quality of ISI marked products in the market. Action is taken against the erring manufacturers whose product does not conform to the Indian Standard.

BIS also organizes publicity through mass media. Besides, BIS organizes Consumer Awareness Programmes wherein the consumers are made aware of quality of ISI marked products and also its misuse and colourable imitations.

The Govt. of India has already notified the new BIS Act, 2016 which has come into force w.e.f. 12 October 2017.

At present, there is no proposal for amendment in BIS Act, 2016.

This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan  in Lok  Sabha today.

                  No State/UT has reported any incidence of death due to starvation in the country.

 However, to prevent the starvation deaths in the country and to provide food security to the vulnerable population and to ensure that people living below poverty line get adequate food grains, the Government has been providing food grains at highly subsidized prices to the targeted population through the State Governments/UT Administrations under National Food Security Act, 2013 and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS) (Mid Day Meal Scheme, Wheat Based Nutrition Programme, Scheme for Adolescent Girls, Annapurna Scheme, Allocation of foodgrains under Welfare Institutions & Hostels Scheme). The main responsibility for implementation of the Act including distribution of foodgrain lies with the States/UTs. An annual allocation of over 610 LMT of foodgrain is made by Government of India under NFSA and OWS.

Further Department has issued instructions to all States/UTs that no person/ household shall be deleted from the list of eligible beneficiaries/households and denied subsidized foodgrain under NFSA only on the ground of not possessing of Aadhar number. Instructions have also been issued for providing foodgrains even in the event of authentication failure through alternative mechanisms.

To improve the health and nutritional status of vulnerable population of the country, Govt. of India has taken various other measures as well.  Some of these are:-

Under  Reproductive  and  Child  Health  (RCH)  Programme of  National  Health  Mission, various interventions are  implemented  to  improve  the  health of  mother and children which have implication on nutritional status of children. These are: 
 

 Promotion  of  appropriate  infant  and  young  child  feeding  practices (IYCF) that  include  early Initiation of  breastfeeding  and exclusive  breastfeeding  till 6  months  of age during Village Health and Nutrition Days and household visits for counseling by ASHAs. 

Treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition at special units called the Nutrition Rehabilitation Centers (NRCs).

Specific program to prevent and combat micronutrient deficiencies of Vitamin A and Iron & Folic Acid.  Vitamin A supplementation is provided for children till the age of 5 years.  Under the National Iron plus Initiative, bi-weekly Iron & Folic Acid supplementation is provided to children 6 to 60 months.

 

Management of under-nutrition and common neonatal and childhood illnesses at community and Facility level by training service providers in IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal    and Childhood Illnesses) training. 

National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) for promotion of adequately Iodated salt (> 15 ppm Iodine content) consumption at household level.

Nutrition Education to increase the awareness and bring about desired changes in the dietary practices including the promotion of breast feeding and dietary diversification is being encouraged under both Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) of M/o Women and Child Development and National Health Mission (NHM) under MoHFW.  Monthly Village Health and Nutrition Days are observed in villages for provision of maternal and Child care.   Emphasis is given to intake of green leafy vegetables and other important sources of iron and means to promote iron absorption.

                  As on date, Government is not planning to import pulses.

Government has approved creation of dynamic buffer stock of pulses of upto 20 lakh MT.

In the month of September 2018, Government launched a scheme for disposal of stock of pulses procured under Price Support Scheme (PSS) during Kharif and Rabi season 2017-18, by way of distribution to States/UTs for utilization under various welfare schemes like MDM, PDS, ICDS, etc. with Central subsidy of ₹ 15/- per kg over the issue price as a one-time measure for a period of 12 months or till PSS pulses stock of 34.88 lakh MT lasts (whichever is earlier).

As per the 3rd Advance Estimates released by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, production of pulses for the year 2018-19 is estimated to be 23.22 Million MT (MMT) as compared to 25.42 MMT as per final estimates for the year 2017-18.

Government has taken various measures to ensure availability of pulses and moderate its price fluctuations. Such measures include initiatives for increasing production and productivity of pulses through National Food Security Mission (NFSM), announcing appropriate Minimum Support Price (MSP) to incentivize production, etc. Further, Government has signed a MoU with Mozambique for assured supply of Tur and other pulses and also suitably amends trade policy to improve availability, etc.

In addition, calibrated releases are made from buffer stock of pulses from time to time to moderate price fluctuations.

                Consequent upon merger of regulatory functions of Forward Market Division with SEBI vide  Finance Act 2015, SEBI is presently the regulator of commodity derivatives market. Cases of suspected speculation and price manipulation in the agricultural commodity derivatives are taken up by Government regularly with SEBI. Further, in order to strengthen and maintain the integrity of the commodity derivatives market, SEBI has taken various measures and has prescribed specific norms in the areas of risk management like, imposition of additional or/and special margins to contain high volatility in commodity derivatives prices, position limits, daily price limits, governance of stock exchanges, registration of brokers etc. SEBI is also carrying out integrated monitoring and surveillance of trading activity, under which, the commodity derivatives market is continuously kept under watch to ensure market integrity.

As per the 3rd Advance Estimates released by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, production of pulses for the year 2018-19 is estimated to be 23.22 Million MT (MMT) as compared to 25.42 MMT as per final estimates for the year 2017-18 while production of oilseeds for the year 2018-19 is estimated to be 31.42 Million MT (MMT) as compared to 31.46 MMT as per final estimates for the year 2017-18.  

 

 The total availability of edible oils from all sources (primary and secondary) for 2018-19 is estimated at 99.94 LMT as against 103.80 LMT in 2017-18. The country has to rely on imports to meet the gap between demand and supply of edible oils. Import of edible oils is under Open General Licence. In the year 2018-19 (Nov-Apr), 7.44 MMT of edible oils was imported as compared to 14.59 MMT in 2017-18. In case of pulses, import during 2018-19 stood at 2.53 MMT as against an import of 5.61 MMT in 2017-18.

Government has taken various measures including initiatives for increasing production and productivity of pulses and oil seeds through National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP) respectively, promulgating appropriate Minimum Support Price (MSP) to incentivize production of pulses and oil seeds, introducing suitable trade and fiscal policy measures to promote availability of pulses and edible oil at reasonable prices. In addition, Government has signed a MoU with Mozambique for assured supply of Tur and other pulses, and also undertakes calibrated releases of pulses from buffer from time to time to moderate price fluctuations. Also, Government closely monitors prices of pulses and edible oils for timely interventions in case of price fluctuations.

                Under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), the eligible households are entitled to receive foodgrains, namely- Wheat, Rice & Coarse-grains through Public Distribution System (PDS). As per entitlements under the Act, the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households are eligible to receive 35 kg of foodgrains per family per month, whereas the Priority Households (PHH) beneficiaries are eligible to receive 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month.

Distribution of subsidized sugar of 1 Kg per AAY family per month is also continued under PDS.

Further, clause 9(9) of Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) (Control) Order, 2015, empowers the State/UT Governments to allow sale of commodities other than distribution of foodgrains through Fair Price Shops to improve the viability of the fair price shop operations.  

 As per the information received from States/UTs upto 22.05.2019 a Statement indicating State-wise total No. of ration cardholders is at Annex-I.  

 Few complaints about foodgrains and other commodities not being given to the consumers in full quantity from Government ration shops under PDS have come to the notice of the Government in some State/UTs.  Therefore, as and when such complaints are received by the Government, these are referred to the concerned State/UT Governments for inquiry and appropriate action. 

 Under the PDS, the distribution of cereals and other commodities is presently being done as per the details furnished under part (a) above.

                Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has provided the information as follows:

Instances of sale/supply of sub-standard and adulterated food items, use of excess chemicals, artificial colouring of vegetables, presence of pesticides/insecticides residues in fruits and vegetables beyond prescribed MRLs etc. are detected during the enforcement activities undertaken by the State/UT Governments . Such instances have also been reported to FSSAI through various other channels.

To check adulteration in vegetable items and in other food products, State/UT Governments regularly conduct surveillance and enforcement drives and conduct regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products to check that they comply with the standards laid down under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the rules and regulations made thereunder. In cases where the food samples are found to be non-conforming, recourse is taken to penal provisions under Chapter IX of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

Further, consumer is being educated about detection of adulteration and steps to be taken for reducing harmful effects of chemicals etc.. To combat adulteration in commonly adulterated food items, such as milk, spices and condiments, honey, water, oils & fats, FSSAI has released a Detect Adulteration with Rapid Test (DART) which is a compilation of common quick tests for detection of food adulterants at household level by the citizens themselves so as to induce awareness among the consumers about food safety.

Consumers are also being educated about importance of washing fruits and vegetables before consumption to avoid harmful effects of pesticides/insecticides residue in fruits and vegetables. FSSAI has also asked Commissioners of Food Safety, States/UTs to undertake awareness campaigns on pesticides/insecticides residues in fruits and vegetables.

Guidance notes for guidance of consumers have also been issued on various topics such as artificial ripening of fruits, stickers on Fruits and Vegetables, pulses and beans and many other topics. These are available on website of FSSAI.

This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan  in Lok  Sabha today.

ANNEXURE

 

MEASURES TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AVOID WASTAGE/DAMAGE OF FOODGRAINS 

The following steps are taken to prevent damage of foodgrains:  


	All godowns are constructed as per specifications.


 


	Foodgrains are stored by adopting proper scientific code of storage practices.


 


	Dunnage materials such as wooden crates, bamboo mats, polythene sheets are used to check migration of moisture from the floor to the foodgrains.


 


	Fumigation covers, nylon ropes, nets and insecticides for control of stored grain insect pests are provided in all the godowns.


 


	Prophylactic (spraying of insecticides) and curative treatments (fumigation) are carried out regularly and timely in godowns for the control of stored grain insect pests. 


 


	Effective rat control measures, both in covered godowns as well as in CAP storage are taken. 


 


	Foodgrains in ‘Cover and Plinth’ (CAP) storage are stored on elevated plinths and wooden crates are used as dunnage material. Stacks are properly covered with specifically fabricated low-density black polythene water -proof covers and tied with nylon ropes/nets.


 


	Regular periodic inspections of the stocks/godowns are undertaken by qualified and trained staff and all senior officers. The health of the foodgrains is monitored at regular intervals by a system of checks and super checks at different levels. Following Checks and Super checks are conducted in the godowns by FCI to ensure proper preservation of foodgrains in the storage.


 


	
	
		Fortnightly inspection of stocks on 100% basis by Technical Assistant.
		Monthly inspection by Manager(QC)
		Quarterly inspection by AGM(QC)
		Super Checks by Regional, Zonal and FCI Hqrs. Squads.
	
	


 


	The principle of “First in First Out” (FIFO) is followed to the extent possible so as to avoid longer storage of foodgrains in godowns.


 


	Damage Monitoring Cells have been set up at District, Regional and Zonal levels to regularly monitor quality of stocks and reduce damages.


 


	Leakage point in the roof of godowns are regularly identified and repaired.


 


	Regular cleaning of drainages in the godown premises ensured.


 


	Efforts are made to ensure that there are no seepages inside the godowns.


 


	Efforts are also made to ensure that there is no clogging up of water in the premises of the godowns.


 


	Immediate actions are taken to segregate & recondition of the stocks whenever it gets affected.

                 All India Daily Average Retail Prices of 22 essential food items including vegetables (Potato, Onion and Tomatoes) for initial months of current year and last two years is Annexed.

 

Prices of food items including vegetables are inter-alia affected by mismatch in demand and supply, shortfall in production owing to adverse weather conditions and seasonality, increased transportation costs, supply chain constraints like lack of storage facilities, artificial shortage created by hoarding and black marketing, etc.

 

Government has taken various measures from time to time to stabilize prices of essential food items which, inter-alia, include appropriately utilizing trade and fiscal policy instruments like import and export duty, Minimum Export Price, export restrictions, etc. to regulate domestic availability and moderate prices; imposition of stock limits and advising States for effective action against hoarders & black marketers ; and, provision of higher Minimum Support Prices to incentivize farmers for increasing production. Government is also implementing Schemes which, inter alia, include Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP), etc. for increasing agricultural production and productivity through appropriate interventions. Besides, Government is also implementing Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) to help moderate the volatility in prices of agri-horticultural commodities like pulses, onion, and potato. Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has also formulated a new scheme “Operation Greens” for integrated development of Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) value chain which, inter alia, has the objective of price stabilization for producers and consumers by proper production planning in the TOP clusters and introduction of dual use varieties. These policy interventions by Government had ensured that prices of the majority of essential food items monitored by Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) have remained relatively stable over the period and with no major price rise.

                During the year 2019-20, as on 16.06.19, buffer of around 44,205 MT of onions has been built through procurement from crop of Rabi-2019 season as against a buffer of 13,508 MT built in 2018-19.

 

Stock limits on onions is periodically reviewed keeping in view the price and availability situation. The stock limit on onion was withdrawn on 31st March, 2018 in view of the market scenario. Onion from the buffer was released during lean periods of 2017-18 & 2018-19 to moderate the prices and disincentivize hoarding. The Central Government has offered onions from the buffer to States/UTs at no profit no loss basis to improve availability and moderate prices of onion during lean season.

The Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan today asserted that the main objective of the Ministry is to ensure that not a single grain of food being produced by the hard work and labour of farmers gets wasted and all of it is procured by the government at Minimum Support Price while ensuring that corruption is completely removed. Shri Ram Vilas Paswan stated this at a press conference charting out the future roadmap for the Food Corporation of India (FCI). 


Union Minister Shri Ram Vilas Paswan stated that primacy will be given to ensuring that the functioning of FCI is streamlined and fast paced as per recommendations of the Shanta Kumar Committee. Shri Paswan said that plan is to create 100 lakh ton silo storage capacity in the country.  Previous government had constructed 6.75 lakh ton storage capacity while work is ongoing for 22 lakh ton storage capacity. Shri Paswan stated that the reason for slow progress in construction of silos is mainly due to the necessity of having 1.5km rail siding next to the silos.  Now RITES has been assigned the task of changing the silo model and they will give their recommendations in 90 days to FCI. The target for completion of remaining silos is 2021 so that the wheat procured in March 2022 can be stored in these silos.


Shri Paswan emphasised that the procurement of wheat and rice will continue as before so that the farmers continue to get the benefit of MSP being set by the government. 338 lakh ton of wheat has been procured in the recently concluded Rabi season procurement while in 2018-19 423 lakh ton of Rice has been procured out of which 341 lakh ton rice has reached FCI.


Shri Ram Vilas Paswan further stated that direct recruitment process of FCI is being made more transparent through online examination which is being done in two phases. While first phase has already been completed on 3rd June, second phase will be completed by the second week of July. Similarly, recruitment of 77 posts of category 1 and 367 posts of category 2 will begin in July.


Talking about the 3 types of labourers in FCI namely Departmental, Daily Payment System (DPS) and No work no pay workers along with contractual labour, Union Minister Shri Paswan asserted that a big decision is being deliberated upon by the government to finish the 3 different arrangements and bring all workers of FCI under a single, uniform system which will bring stability of tenure and secured wages for all. A consensus in this regard is being formulated with all the different employee unions, 50% of whom are already on board.   


Union Minister Shri Ram Vilas Paswan further said that in order to improve the usage of Information Technology in FCI, a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) will be implemented, the work for which will begin in August, 2019 and will be completed by August 2020. This move will benefit 22,000 employees in 196 offices of FCI.


Shri Paswan also stated that integration work for depot online of FCI and CWC will be done in consultation with State governments and meetings will be held with the Food Ministers and Secretaries of State government in July to set the targets for integration.

                The Income Tax Department conducted search and seizure operations on 27.06.2019 on a prominent business group based in Srinagar, covering 4 premises in the Kashmir Valley and 6 places in the Jammu region. Apart from the premises in J&K, 10 other business premises situated in Ludhiana, NCR and Jammu belonging to parties that have actively assisted the main tax evader in concealing his income and indulging in illegal activities have also been covered under survey action. The group is engaged in the business of real estate and information technology. There were allegations of large scale diversion and misappropriation of loan taken from J&K Bank by the group.

During the search, it was detected that the tax evader has been given illegal benefit of Rs 60 crore by J&K Bank. His outstanding loan of Rs 190 crore was settled at Rs 130 crore, although he did not deserve any concessional treatment. Additionally, even the reduced bank liability has either been defaulted by him or the repayment has been facilitated by active connivance of bank officials, who have ever greened his loan account by lending to third parties, who, in turn, gave their loaned funds to the tax evader through dubious financial transactions with him. 

During the search operation, evidence was found that the main promoter was a director in a Dubai based company. He is also holding and operating a foreign bank account. Neither his interest in the Dubai Company nor the foreign bank account has ever been disclosed by him in his tax returns. He is likely to face action under the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 as well as other relevant laws of the land for deliberate omission to declare foreign investment as mandated by law.

Field enquires have also revealed that the tax evader has sold/booked part of his real estate project of Paradise Avenue near Jammu against unaccounted cash. The cash component has neither been disclosed in tax returns by purchasers of the flats of Paradise Avenue nor has he disclosed these receipts in his books of accounts.

Other than the Paradise Avenue project, the tax evader has also undertaken real estate transactions in his personal capacity or in the name of family members wherein allegedly more than Rs 7 crore of unaccounted cash has changed hands. 

During the demonetisation period, the group had made cash deposits of Rs. 1.44 crore. The main promoter could not explain the source of these cash deposits during the course of search action.

                A formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for data exchange between the two regulatory organizations here today. The MoU was signed by Shri K.V.R. Murty, Joint Secretary, MCA and Smt. Madhabi Puri Buch, Whole Time Member, SEBI in the presence of senior officers from both the organisations.

The MoU comes in the wake of increasing need for surveillance in the context of Corporate Frauds affecting important sectors of the economy.

The MoU will facilitate the sharing of data and information between SEBI and MCA on an automatic and regular basis. It will enable sharing of specific information such as details of suspended companies, delisted companies, shareholding pattern from SEBI and financial statements filed with the Registrar by corporates, returns of allotment of shares, audit reports relating to corporates. The MoU will ensure that both MCA and SEBI have seamless linkage for regulatory purposes. In addition to regular exchange of data, SEBI and MCA will also exchange with each other, on request, any information available in their respective databases, for the purpose of carrying out scrutiny, inspection, investigation and prosecution.

The MoU comes into force from the date it was signed and is an ongoing initiative of MCA and SEBI, who are already collaborating through various existing mechanisms. A Data Exchange Steering Group also has been constituted for the initiative, which will meet periodically to review the data exchange status and take steps to further improve the effectiveness of the data sharing mechanism. 

The MoU marks the beginning of a new era of cooperation and synergy between the two regulators.

                Union Minister of Culture (IC), Shri Prahlad Singh Patel called on  two senior archaeologists in the country, Prof. B.B. Lal former Director General (1968-1972), Archaeological Survey of India and Padma Bhushan awardee (2000) and Dr. R.S. Bisht, former Joint Director General, Archaeological Survey of India and Padma Shri awardee (2013) today at their home to pay his respect to them. This is the first time when a Union culture minister visited these great personalities personally at their home.





 

During the interaction with Prof. B.B. Lal the Union Minister discussed issues related to the archaeological sites of Kalibangan and Purana Qila, their conservation and preservation and showcasing them to the public.  He also stressed on the contribution of Kalibangan excavations and the need for preserving the site for the larger benefit of the public and educating them to creating awareness.  The Minister discussed on the mechanism of preserving the fragile excavated remains at Kalibangan in the form of suitably designed canopies over them and draining off the rain water through properly designed channels.  This sort of providing canopies will preserve all excavated sites. The  Minister further stressed the need for constituting a Task Force under a suitable leadership for providing conservation measures to the site of Kalibangan, so that the desired results are achieved in a time bound manner.

Prof. Lal stressed that the antecedents of Harappan culture in the Haryana and Punjab region is also important to understand in the context of overall development of earliest cultures.  In this context, investigation of Mesolithic and microlithic cultures attains special importance to understand the emergence of sedentary agro-pastoral communities that could have ultimately contributed for the Harappan culture.  Prof. Lal highlighted some of the earliest evidences of agricultural field indicating presence of multi-cropping pattern and earthquake from Kalibangan.  

The discussions with Dr. Bisht were held mainly on the Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology, now located at a new campus at Greater Noida.  The ASI has recently shifted the Institute from the present campus in Red Fort to Greater Noida in order to create state of the art lab facilities in various disciplines of archaeology like archaeobotany (for study of floral remains), archaeozoology (for study of faunal remains), geoarchaeology, anthropology, petrology, and other subjects.  These labs will serve as teaching labs for the students to have a first hand knowledge.   

The need for evolving a comprehensive culture policy for the overall development and implementation of matters related to culture, archaeology, and their various allied subjects was also stressed upon.  The cultural vestiges spread across the country also need proposer study, research and showcasing for revealing our glorious past.  In this regard, the study of inscriptions, their decipherment and interpretation also plays a crucial role. 

Prof. Lal is presently 99 years old and is the senior most archaeologist from ASI, and served in various senior capacities in Government of India, Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla; Professor in Gwalior University and member of various academic institutions.  Prof. Lal was trained by Sir Mortimer Wheeler at Taxila in 1944 and later joined Archaeological Survey of India.  Prof. Lal excavated several important landmark sites including Hastinapura (U.P.), Sisupalgarh (Orissa), Purana Qila (Delhi), Kalibangan (Rajasthan).  From 1975-76 onwards, Prof. Lal investigated sites like Ayodhya, Bharadvaja Ashrama, Sringaverapura, Nandigrama and Chitrakoota under the Archaeology of Ramayana Sites.  Prof. Lal has authored 20 books and over 150 research articles on various national and international journals.

Dr. Bisht had his basic education in Sanskrit and obtained degrees Visharad (1958) and Sahityaratna (1960), and later graduated in Ancient Indian History and Archaeology.  Dr. Bisht is famous for his excavation at the Harappan site of Dholavira, one among the five largest Harappan sites in the Indian sub-continent.  Dr. Bisht also excavated Harappan sites like Sanghol (Punjab), Banawali (Haryana) and other sites like Semthan (J&K), Chechar and Nalanda (Bihar).

                Shri Prahlad Singh Patel, Minister of State (I/C) of Culture & Tourism, Government of India inaugurated the exhibition titled ""Astitva: The Essence of Prabhakar Barwe”, at National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi today. 

Highlighting the significance of museums, the Culture Minister said that museums are required ‘to look into our past thereby helping us to move forward in life by learning things from the past’. The Minister also added the museums act as a ‘symbol of respect for our ancestors’. The Minister further added that going to the nature and art, helps us to have a peaceful mind and quell arrogance, for this we also need to respect our art & Gurus.

‘Astitva : The essence of Prabhakar Barwe’, is the first of its kind to be held in New Delhi that will present his artistic oeuvre in four distinct phases. The artworks are chronologically orchestrated in each space, each representing a peculiar phase of Barwe's practice. Beginning with Roop Tantra, one encounters Barwe's early works from Sir J.J. School of Art and their transition into Tantric formations. Accompanied with designs made by the artist during his years at the Weavers Service Centre and a few textile works will be displayed, depicting Barwe's engrossment and turn from design into Tantra, and ultimately into his own Swatantra, reflected through his work Ethereal Transitions. Works beginning from 1958 until 1977 form a part of this space. The next two segments are the Roop Artha that traces the cognitive shifts in the mind of the artist; the paintings with subtle tones comprising Barwe's creations from 1972 to 1988, and the Roop Tattva, which becomes an allegory to Barwe's work, Many Identities of the Self that displays paintings from the late 1980s to his last unfinished canvas. 

A fascinating feature of this exhibition is the section RoopVichaar, that will exhibit a selection from Barwe's 52 diaries – displayed as diary pages, animated videos and facsimile reproductions of a few diaries. In addition, a documented timeline, which chronicles the artist's life, accompanied by a reading corner with collated archives also forms part of the exhibit. 

The exhibition will be open for public until Sunday 28th July, 2019; timings are Tuesday to Friday: 11.00 am to 6.30 pm, Saturday & Sunday: 11.00 am to 8.00 pm; Mondays Closed.

                The Minister of State (I/c) of Culture & Tourism, Government of India, Shri Prahalad Singh Patel will inaugurate the exhibition titled ""Unknown Masterpieces of Himachal Folk Art”, at National Museum, New Delhi, tomorrow. The Exhibition is being jointly organised by the National Museum, New Delhi and Home of Folk Art (Museum of Tribal, Folk and Neglected Art), Gurugram in which more than 240 artefacts are will be on display. Out of this 230 objects belong to the personal lifetime collection of Late K.C. Aryan, Home of Folk Art, Gurugram. The exhibition has been Curated by Mr. B.N. Aryan, Director, Home of Folk Art, Gurugram and assisted by Ms Abira Bhattacharya from National Museum under the direction of Dr. B.R. Mani, Director General National Museum. The exhibition will remain open for public upto 31st July, 2019.

The present exhibition aims to highlight the Folk art tradition of Himachal Pradesh. Prior to being carved out as an independent state, Himachal Pradesh was known as the Punjab Hill States, the term coined by the British administrators. The arts and crafts of this state give us some idea of what must have existed in the plains of Punjab, the province that had to bear the brunt of perennial invasions and warfare from the north-western frontiers of India. 

Like other parts of India, in Himachal Pradesh also, two stylistic streams of art and culture - classical or courtly (the Great Tradition) and folk (the Little Tradition) - were nurtured by the natives from the earliest times. Although no examples of art or craft objects are extant prior to the 3rd century BCE, the figures of Hindu deities engraved on the coins issued by the chieftains of the janapadas (republics) such as the Kunindas, the Malavas, the Audumbaras, etc. attest to the fact that the iconographic precepts governing the deities such as Shiva, six-headed Karttikeya or Kumara, Gaja-Lakshmi, Krittika, Rishi Vishvamitra, etc. were fully evolved by the 3rd century BCE ; that contemporaneously, the sculptors must have shaped identical images in the round in wood, stone and metal. Evidently, the tradition of sculpting images of the deities and rishis (seers) – to the latter are dedicated numerous wood and stone shrines erected on the sites where they had meditated dotting the entire length and breadth of this state – was in existence and continued in subsequent centuries. The stone statues of Vishnu and numerous reliefs carved in the Sarnath style and discovered from the Ambika Mata and Parashurama temples in Nirmand in Outer Saraj in Kulu district, popularly known as the Kashi of the Himalayan region, dated to the 4th-5th centuries CE testify to this phenomenon. So do the free standing wood statues of Surya and one of his attendants Dandi and Pingala, and four door frames featuring elegant, flowing forms of Hindu goddesses executed in Gupta and post-Gupta style, i.e. late 6th-early 7th centuries CE. These were enshrined in the wooden temple of Surya that has been reconstructed and dedicated to Docha-Mocha (a village deity) in Gajan hamlet in Kulu valley.

                            Shri Krishnaswamy Natarajan took over as 23rd chief of Indian Coast Guard here today. A 5th Batch Officer of the Indian Coast Guard, he joined service in January 1984. During the initial years, he specialised in select core competencies viz. Search and Rescue as well as Maritime Safety and Port Operations, at the US Coast Guard Reserve Training Centre, Yorktown, Virginia. The incoming Director General holds a Master's Degree in Defence & Strategic Studies from Madras University and is an alumnus of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. 

            In his illustrious career spanning over 35 years, the Flag Officer has had the distinction of holding important Command and Staff appointments, both afloat and ashore. He has commanded all classes of Indian Coast Guard ships, viz. Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessel (AOPV), Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV), Fast Patrol Vessel (FPV) and Inshore Patrol Vessel (IPV). He has also served as the Commander Coast Guard District No. 5 (Tamil Nadu), the Commanding Officer ICGS Mandapam and as the first Officer-in-Charge of Coast Guard Training Centre (Kochi).

            Post 26/11, the country was recovering from one of the worst terrorist attack. His moment of reckoning came during that period, when as the Deputy Director General (Policy & Plans), on being elevated to the Flag Rank he spearheaded the Staff Division of Policy & Plans at the Coast Guard Headquarters and was instrumental in giving a major fillip to the overall growth of the Coast Guard in terms of setting up of additional 20 Stations, 10 Air Establishment, two Regional Headquarters, two Seaboard Headquarters, contract for 120 ships & boats.

            The Flag Officer was elevated to the rank of Additional Director General in August 2016 and took over the reins as Coast Guard Commander (Western Seaboard). Under his apex watch on the sensitive Western seafront, whilst there were no major marine incidents, the period saw surge in major operations that included apprehension of 1.5 Ton of narcotic substance, mass rescue operations during cyclones, humanitarian assistance during natural calamities in coastal states and focussed Coastal Security Operations. 

            The Flag Officer is a recipient of President’s Tatrakshak Medal for his distinguished service to the nation.

                First Indian Army Mountaineering Expedition to Mt Makalu (8485 M) 2019 has been ‘Flagged In’ by Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh on 28 June 2019. The Indian Army Mountaineering team achieved a singular distinction by placing sixteen members on the summit of Mt Makalu, the fifth highest peak of the world, on 16 May 2019. Indian Army has now climbed all eight-thousander peaks in Nepal.

The team led by Major Manoj Joshi was ‘Flagged Off’ by Director General of Military Training on 26 March 2019 at New Delhi. A highly experienced and balanced team was shortlisted and trained for the expedition which required sheer determination, team spirit and logistic support. The team experienced many difficulties and challenges en-route wherein they fought against nature’s fury, negotiated deep crevasses, withstood now blizzards and climbed near vertical rocks and ice walls but the sheer determination of the valiant climbers and the cohesive team effort brought laurels for the Army and the Nation.

The expedition has shown that given an opportunity, Army team is capable of reaching any height in any terrain under any circumstances.

                In a demonstration of India's commitment to its ties with Egypt and of Indian Navy's increasing footprint and operational reach, Indian Naval Ship Tarkash arrived at Alexandria on 28 June 2019 for a three day visit, as a part of Western Fleet Overseas Deployment programme.



During the visit of Tarkash, professional interactions are planned with the Egyptian Navy towards further enhancing co-operation between the two forces. In addition, calls on senior Government and military authorities, sporting, cultural interactions, exchange visit of ships personnel and sharing of best practices, aimed at strengthening ties and mutual understanding between the two Navies, are also planned.

 

India and Egypt are two of the world's oldest civilizations. Building upon the rich and longstanding relations that have existed between India and Egypt, both nations have developed warm relations in several spheres. A number of bilateral agreements for cooperation and cultural exchange exist between the two nations. The geostrategic location of Egypt provides it the unique advantage of being at the crossroads of Africa, Asia and Europe. Crucial Sea Lines of Communication pass through Red Sea into the Mediterranean through Suez Canal in Egypt.

 

The current visit seeks to underscore India's peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly countries and, in particular, to strengthen the existing bonds of friendship between India and Egypt.

 

Tarkash, commanded by Captain Sathish Vasudev, is a state of the art warship of the Indian Navy equipped with a versatile range of weapons and sensors capable of addressing threats in all the three dimensions. The ship is part of the Indian Navy's Western Fleet and is under the operational Command of Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Naval Command, based at Mumbai.

                            An Indian Air Force Jaguar aircraft took off from Air Force Station Ambala this morning for a training mission around 0745h. The aircraft, immediately after takeoff, had an engine failure due to suspected bird hit. The pilot assessed the situation correctly and jettisoned external stores as per the standard operating procedures. The prompt and correct actions by the pilot enabled him to recover the crippled aircraft on single engine and carry out a safe landing at Air Force Station, Ambala. A court of inquiry has been ordered.

                 A major milestone in the indigenous series production of advanced technology Software Defined Radios (SDRs) has been achieved by signing the Contract with M/s BEL for induction of Software Defined Radios for Indian Navy at the cost of Rs 488 crore on June 18, 2019 by Ministry of Defence.

The SDRs have been designed and developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in association with various agencies like Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics (CAIR) and Weapon and Electronics System Engineering Establishment (WESEE) of the Indian Navy.  The SDRs will be manufactured by M/s Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).

As part of the contract, present hardware based legacy communication sets will be replaced by software based multi-band, multi-functional and multi-role/mission radios to improve information sharing and situational awareness through secure communication means.  Being indigenous, the SDRs are associated with indigenous waveforms designed to provide wide range of frequency usage and a major capability enhancement.

                Capital procurement of defence equipment is undertaken from various domestic as well as foreign vendors, based on operational requirements of the Armed Forces, the availability or capacity to produce the equipment in India and abroad, to keep the Armed Forces in a state of readiness to meet the entire spectrum of security challenges.

During the last four financial years (2015-16 to 2018-19), 135 contracts have been signed with Indian vendors and 75 contracts have been signed with foreign vendors for capital procurement of defence equipment for Armed Forces.  The defence equipment contracted with foreign vendors during this period include aircrafts, helicopters, missiles, rockets, artillery guns, assault rifles, navy vessels, simulators and ammunitions.

Government is pursuing initiatives to achieve higher levels of indigenisation and self-reliance in the defence sector by harnessing the capabilities of the public and private sector industries in the country.  These measures include according priority and preference to procurement from Indian vendors and liberalization of the licensing regime.  Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) accords the highest priority to Buy Indian (Indigenously) Designed Developed and Manufactured (IDDM). The ‘Make’ procedure has been simplified with provisions for earmarking projects not exceeding development cost of Rs.10 crores (government funded) and Rs.3 crores (Industry funded) for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); and with provisions for involving private industry as production agencies and technology transfer partners.  Government has also promulgated the policy on Strategic Partnership in the Defence Sector to encourage broader participation of the private sector in manufacture of major defence platforms and equipment.

 This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik in a written reply to Shri Mohammed Faizal P.P in Lok Sabha today.

                Replacement of ageing and obsolete defence equipment is part of modernisation of Armed Forces which is a continuous process based on threat perception, operational challenges, technological changes and available resources.  The process is based on a 15 year Long Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP), five year Service Capital Acquisition Plan (SCAP) and Annual Acquisition Plan (AAP).

Government attaches high priority to ensuring that the Armed Forces are adequately equipped and operationally prepared to deal the entire spectrum of security challenges facing the country.  In this context, there is a constant endeavour to modernize the Armed Forces through acquisition of contemporary systems, development of new technologies and upgrading of conventional equipment.

Allocated budget is optimally utilised to avoid gap between the need and the availability of funds. There has been consistent increase in total Capital Budget of Ministry of Defence.  The details of Capital Budget (BE) for the last three years and current year are as under:

                The Government has taken initiatives in construction of warship under the “Make in India”.

Major shipbuilding projects in respect to Indigenous Aircraft Carrier, Frigates, Submarines, Destroyers, Corvettes, Naval Offshore Patrol Vessels etc., are at various stages of execution at different Indian shipyards.

The Navy designs most of its weapon intensive warships in-house and gets them built indigenously at Indian Shipyards.  The Indian Navy has in-house capability to design complex frontline combatants like Corvettes, Stealth Frigates, Destroyers and Aircraft Carriers.

            Several measures have been taken by Government to meet Indian Navy’s requirements.  Some of them are as follows:-


	Strengthening infrastructure of DPSU shipyards.
	Adoption of modular construction technologies to bring down construction period of warships.
	Policy intervention for participation of private shipyards in Naval projects.
	Policy intervention for promoting indigenisation of imported equipment for warships.
	Promoting Artificial Intelligence in warship construction activities.

                Ordnance Factories and Defence Public Sector Undertakings have played a huge role in making our country a defence production hub.  There are 41 Ordnance Factories and 9 DPSUs in our country contributing to more than Rs.58,000 crores approx. in defence production every year.  Government provides support to Defence Public Sector Undertakings and Ordnance Factories to expand their activities. As a result of these efforts, the Defence Public Sector Undertakings have achieved the turnover of Rs.45,776 crores in 2018-19 which is the highest ever by the Defence PSUs. Four Defence PSUs, viz. Hindustan Aeronautical Ltd. (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL), Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) and Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. (BEML) have recorded their highest turnover during the year 2018-19.

As a part of Prime Minister’s Agenda for public sector enterprises, the Defence PSUs have been given a target to achieve 25% of their turnover through exports by 2022-23. Further, they have also been targeted to indigenize Rs.15,000 crores worth goods by 2022-23. Each defence PSU is in the process of developing to projects relating to Artificial Intelligence.

Several steps have also been taken to strengthen Ordnance Factory Board. These include:


	Approval, in principle, has been granted for 15 proposals of Rs.861 crores for capital upgradation and modernization of Ordnance Factories during 2018-19.
	OFB Procurement Manual has been revised during 2018-19 to streamline the procurement of store items in OFB. Export division under Member, OFB has been started to promote greater exports from OFB and enhanced delegation of powers given to Member (Exports) of OFB.
	494 workers of Ordnance Factory, Avadi are being re-skilled for employment in new trades.


In pursuance of ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government, following measures have been taken to achieve substantive self-reliance in defence production: -


	Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) has been revised in 2016 wherein specific provisions have been introduced for stimulating growth of the domestic defence industry.
	A new category of procurement ‘Buy {Indian-IDDM (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured)}’ has been introduced in DPP-2016 to promote indigenous design and development of defence equipment. It has been accorded top most priority for procurement of capital equipment. Besides this, preference has been accorded to ‘Buy (Indian)’, ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ & ‘Make’ categories of capital acquisition over ‘Buy (Global)’ & ‘Buy & Make (Global)’ categories.
	Government has notified the ‘Strategic Partnership (SP)’ Model which envisages establishment of long-term strategic partnerships with Indian entities through a transparent and competitive process, wherein they would tie up with global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to seek technology transfers to set up domestic manufacturing infrastructure and supply chains.
	The ‘Make’ Procedure has been simplified with provisions for funding of 90% of development cost by the Government to Indian industry and reserving projects not exceeding development cost of Rs.10 crore (Government funded) and Rs.3 crore (Industry funded) for MSMEs.
	Separate procedure for ‘Make-II’ sub-category has been notified wherein a number of industry friendly provisions such as relaxation of eligibility criterion, minimal documentation, provision for considering proposals suggested by industry/individual etc., have been introduced. Till date, 36 proposals for development by industry have been given ‘in-principle’ approval under Make-II. List of Proposals are as given below.

	Government has decided to establish two defence industrial corridors to serve as an engine of economic development and growth of defence industrial base in the country. These are spanning across Chennai, Hosur, Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu and spanning across Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi, Kanpur, Chitrakoot and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh (UP).
	An innovation ecosystem for Defence titled Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) has been launched in April 2018. iDEX is aimed at creation of an ecosystem to foster innovation and technology development in Defence and Aerospace by engaging Industries including MSMEs, Start-ups, Individual Innovators, R&D institutes and Academia and provide them grants/funding and other support to carry out R&D which has potential for future adoption for Indian defence and aerospace needs.
	The Ministry has instituted a new framework titled ‘Mission Raksha Gyan Shakti’ which aims to provide boost to the IPR culture in indigenous defence industry.
	Government has notified a Policy for indigenisation of components and spares used in Defence Platforms in March 2019 with the objective to create an industry ecosystem which is able to indigenize the imported components (including alloys & special materials) and sub-assemblies for defence equipment and platform manufactured in India
	Defence Investor Cell has been created in the Ministry to provide all necessary information including addressing queries related to investment opportunities, procedures and regulatory requirements for investment in the sector.
	FDI Policy has been revised and under the revised policy, FDI is allowed under automatic route upto 49% and beyond 49% through Government route wherever it is likely to result in access to modern technology or for other reasons to be recorded.
	The Defence Products List for the purpose of issuing Industrial Licenses (ILs) under IDR Act has been revised and most of the components, parts, sub-systems, testing equipment and production equipment have been removed from the list, so as to reduce the entry barriers for the industry, particularly small & medium segment.  The initial validity of the Industrial Licence granted under the IDR Act has been increased from 03 years to 15 years with a provision to further extend it by 03 years on a case-to-case basis. So far, Government has issued 439 licenses covering 264 companies till March 2019. Industrial Licenses are issued for manufacturing of tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles, defence aircraft, space craft and parts thereof, warship, arms and ammunition and allied items of defence equipment, parts and accessories thereof. In addition, for a large number of defence components, no license is required. There are more than 8000 MSMEs which are among the vendor base of OFB & Defence PSUs supplying various items to them. 
	The process for export clearance has been streamlined and made transparent & online.
	Offset guidelines have been made flexible by allowing change of Indian Offset Partners (IOPs) and offset components, even in signed contracts.  Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are now not required to indicate the details of IOPs and products at the time of signing of contracts. ‘Services’ as an avenue of offset have been re-instated.
	Government has set up the Technology Development Fund (TDF) to encourage participation of public/private industries especially MSMEs, through provision of grants, so as to create an eco–system for enhancing cutting edge technology capability for defence applications.


Export of military equipment and services to any foreign country depends on their specific requirement at that particular time and is done after taking the concurrence of the Armed Forces and other stakeholders. There are different channels utilised for promoting exports to friendly foreign countries. 

A single point of contact between India and US has been identified on both sides to promote Defence trade.  Defence exports are also a significant part of the bilateral discussions and negotiations.  Lines of credit are also being utilised for promoting Defence exports.

                The latest edition of bilateral maritime exercise ‘Varuna’ between Indian and French Navy was held in May 2019.  The exercise was conducted in two phases with the objective of conducting advanced exercise for a significant period at sea. 

The expenditure for the same was met out of overall revenue expenditure of the Indian Navy. Seven naval assets and their crew participated in the exercises.  Exercises with friendly foreign countries are conducted by Indian Navy as per approved annual calendar of exercises with the aim of enhancing regional cooperation and inter-operability.  Indian Navy has been engaging with friendly foreign countries in areas of bilateral/multilateral exercises, training and capacity building, hydrography and Human Assistance & Disaster Relief (HADR) as required.

                The Central Government does not have any proposal to acquire land for Defence Industrial Corridors. However, Government of Uttar Pradesh has informed that they have procured 678 hectares of land in Jhansi for the purpose of Defence Industrial Corridor.  They propose to acquire a total of 862 hectares of land in phase I and the procurement of remaining land is expected to be completed by July, 2019.

Jhansi is one of the identified nodes of Defence Industrial Corridor being set up in Uttar Pradesh.  The setting up of Defence Corridor will facilitate in the development of internationally competitive enterprises to manufacture and maintain all major defence eco-system and platforms within the country in order to become strategically independent in defence manufacturing.

                The present capacity available in HAL is adequate to fulfil the existing orders/projects in hand.

       Currently, HAL has firm orders to manufacture platforms like Su-30 MKI, LCA, DO-228, ALH, Chetak and Cheetal helicopters. 

As and when required, HAL borrows from banks to meet its working capital requirements.

An amount of Rs.8140 crore has been paid to HAL from January, 2019 to June, 2019 from defence services. Dues of vendors including HAL are paid depending on the availability of funds, prioritization of schemes and advances/payments that fall due to the vendors including HAL. 

The amount of arrears of payment to other contractors outstanding with HAL is Rs. 868.14 crore.

The Company has initiated various productivity improvement measures through: 


	Developing robust supply chain eco-system by partnering with the emerging Indian Defence Manufacturing Private Sector including Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to enable HAL to focus on its core activities. 
	Introduction of Digital Technology, Software Tools in the areas of Product Life-Cycle Management(PLM) and Product Data Management (PDM) to convert the Design Data to the Production Data, Design Simulator and Analysis to optimise development cost and time. Enhancing capability and improving the processes through introduction of new manufacturing technologies.
	The company implemented an integrated software solution i.e., Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to encompass all areas of Production, Planning, Finance, Materials, Marketing and Human Resources Development (HRD). This facilitates implementation of uniform procedures and practices as well as providing on-line information for decision making for Management. 
	Strengthening the network connectivity to improve the communication and collaboration services across the Company.
	With an objective to enhance the productivity, quality and customer satisfaction, through Skill upgradation, Skill Development Policy was notified in July 2016. Skill Mapping of the employees has been conducted for necessary training based on Skill Gap Analysis. The Company has also implemented globally acclaimed training methodology, “Training Within Industry (TWI)”, to improve efficiency and productivity.  It has resulted in upgrading the skills of the employees, reduction of rejection and rework, reduction of cycle time.  
	Promoting Quality Circles, Suggestion Scheme, implementation of Performance Based Incentives, etc. 


The Company has regularly monitored the Performance of Production and related activities to identify areas for improvement, corrective actions as necessary for implementation as a continuous measure for companywide efficiency and productivity improvement.

                Modernization of the Armed Forces is a continuous process based on threat perception, operational challenges, and technological changes to keep the Armed Forces in a state of readiness to meet entire spectrum of security challenges.  Government attaches the highest priority to ensure that the Armed Forces are sufficiently equipped to meet any operational requirement.  This is achieved through induction of new equipment and technological upgradation of capabilities.  The equipment requirement of the Armed Forces are planned and progressed through a detailed process which include 15 year Long Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP), a five year Service-wise Capital Acquisition Plan, a two year roll-on Annual Acquisition Plan and deliberations by the Defence Acquisition Council chaired by the Raksha Mantri. 

During the last four financial years from 2015-16 to 2018-19, 210 contracts have been signed for capital procurement of defence equipment for Armed Forces such as Helicopters, Naval vessels, Radars, Ballistic Helmets, Artillery Guns, Simulators, Missiles, Bullet Proof Jackets, Electronic Fuzes, and ammunition.

                ‘Make in India’ programme is being used by the Government for defence procurements by categorising the capital acquisition proposals under ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’, ‘Buy (Indian)’, ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’, ‘Make’ and ‘Strategic Partnership Model’ categories of Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP)-2016. DPP -2016 focuses on institutionalising, streamlining and simplifying defence procurement procedure to give a boost to ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government of India. In the last four financial years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2018-19, out of the total 210 contracts, 135 contracts have been signed with Indian Vendors including Defence Public Sector Undertakings/ Public Sector Undertakings/ Ordnance Factory Board and private vendors for capital procurement of defence equipment for Armed Forces such as Helicopters, Naval vessels, Radars, Ballistic Helmets, Artillery Guns, Simulators, Missiles, Bullet Proof Jackets, Electronic Fuzes, and Ammunition.  

Government has issued 439 licenses covering 264 companies till March 2019. Industrial Licenses are issued for manufacturing of tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles, defence aircraft, space craft and parts thereof, warship, arms and ammunition and allied items of defence equipment, parts and accessories thereof. In addition, for a large number of defence components, no license is required. There are more than 8000 MSMEs which are among the vendor base of OFB &Defence PSUs supplying various items to them. 

The percentage of expenditure on purchase of defence equipment (both Capital & Revenue) by the three Services from Indian companies was 54% of total expenditure in the financial year 2018-19.

In pursuance of ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government, following measures have been taken to achieve substantive self-reliance in defence production: -


	Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) has been revised in 2016 wherein specific provisions have been introduced for stimulating growth of the domestic defence industry.
	A new category of procurement ‘Buy {Indian-IDDM (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured)}’ has been introduced in DPP-2016 to promote indigenous design and development of defence equipment. It has been accorded top most priority for procurement of capital equipment. Besides this, preference has been accorded to ‘Buy (Indian)’,‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ & ‘Make’ categories of capital acquisition over ‘Buy (Global)’ & ‘Buy &Make (Global)’ categories.
	Government has notified the ‘Strategic Partnership (SP)’ Model which envisages establishment of long-term strategic partnerships with Indian entities through a transparent and competitive process, wherein they would tie up with global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to seek technology transfers to set up domestic manufacturing infrastructure and supply chains.
	The ‘Make’ Procedure has been simplified with provisions for funding of 90% of development cost by the Government to Indian industry and reserving projects not exceeding development cost of Rs.10 Crore (Government funded) and Rs.3 Crore (Industry funded) for MSMEs.
	Separate procedure for ‘Make-II’ sub-category has been notified wherein a number of industry friendly provisions such as relaxation of eligibility criterion, minimal documentation, provision for considering proposals suggested by industry/individual etc., have been introduced. Till date, 36 proposals for development by industry have been given ‘In-principle’ approval under Make-II.
	Government has decided to establish two defence industrial corridors to serve as an engine of economic development and growth of defence industrial base in the country. These are spanning across Chennai, Hosur, Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu and spanning across Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi, Kanpur and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh (UP).
	An innovation ecosystem for Defence titled Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) has been launched in April 2018. iDEX is aimed at creation of an ecosystem to foster innovation and technology development in Defence and Aerospace by engaging Industries including MSMEs, Start-ups, Individual Innovators, R&D institutes and Academia and provide them grants/funding and other support to carry out R&D which has potential for future adoption for Indian defence and aerospace needs.
	The Ministry has instituted a new framework titled ‘Mission Raksha Gyan Shakti’ which aims to provide boost to the IPR culture in indigenous defence industry.
	Government has notified a Policy for indigenisation of components and spares used in Defence Platforms in March 2019 with the objective to create an industry ecosystem which is able to indigenize the imported components (including alloys & special materials) and sub-assemblies for defence equipment and platform manufactured in India.
	Defence Investor Cell has been created in the Ministry to provide all necessary information including addressing queries related to investment opportunities, procedures and regulatory requirements for investment in the sector.
	FDI Policy has been revised and under the revised policy, FDI is allowed under automatic route upto 49% and beyond 49% through Government route wherever it is likely to result in access to modern technology or for other reasons to be recorded.
	The Defence Products List for the purpose of issuing Industrial Licenses (ILs) under IDR Act has been revised and most of the components, parts, sub-systems, testing equipment and production equipment have been removed from the list, so as to reduce the entry barriers for the industry, particularly small & medium segment.  The initial validity of the Industrial Licence granted under the IDR Act has been increased from 03 years to 15 years with a provision to further extend it by 03 years on a case-to-case basis.
	The process for export clearance has been streamlined and made transparent & online.
	Offset guidelines have been made flexible by allowing change of Indian Offset Partners (IOPs) and offset components, even in signed contracts.  Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are now not required to indicate the details of IOPs and products at the time of signing of contracts.  ‘Services’ as an avenue of offset have been re-instated.
	Government has set up the Technology Development Fund (TDF) to encourage participation of public/private industries especially MSMEs, through provision of grants, so as to create an eco–system for enhancing cutting edge technology capability for defence applications.

The Ministry has fully utilized the allocated budget and there has been no underutilization in the last three years.

During the last three financial years (2016-17 to 2018-19), contracts worth about Rs. 1,38,727.16 crore have been signed with foreign vendors for capital procurements of defence equipment for Armed Forces. 

Government is taking measures for modernization of the Armed Forces, through procurement of new equipment and upgrading of existing equipment and systems. The modernization projects are being progressed as per the approved Capital Acquisition Plans and in terms of the extant Defence Procurement Procedure.

Since the launch of ‘Make in India’ in September 2014, several measures have been taken by the Government to promote indigenous design, development and manufacture of defence & aerospace equipment in the country under ‘Make in India’ by harnessing the capabilities of the public and private sector.

Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) has been revised in 2016 wherein specific provisions have been introduced for stimulating growth of the domestic defence industry.

Government has decided to establish two defence industrial corridors to serve as an engine of economic development and growth of defence industrial base in the country.  These are spanning across Chennai, Hosur, Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu and spanning across Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi, Kanpur and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh (UP).

An innovation ecosystem for Defence titled Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) has been launched in April 2018 by the Hon’ble PM during Defexpo India 2018.  iDEX is aimed at creation of an ecosystem to foster innovation and technology development in Defence and Aerospace by engaging Industries including MSMEs, Start-ups, Individual Innovators, R&D institutes and Academia and provide them grants/funding and other support to carry out R&D which has potential for future adoption for Indian defence and aerospace needs.

The Ministry has instituted a new framework titled ‘Mission RakshaGyan Shakti’ which aims to provide boost to the IPR culture in indigenous defence industry.

Government has notified a Policy for indigenisation of components and spares used in Defence Platforms.  The objective of the policy is to create an industry ecosystem which is able to indigenize the imported components (including alloys & special materials) and sub-assemblies for defence equipment and platform manufactured in India.

Defence Investor Cell has been created in the Ministry to provide all necessary information including addressing queries related to investment opportunities, procedures and regulatory requirements for investment in the sector.

FDI Policy has been revised and under the revised policy, FDI is allowed under automatic route upto49% and beyond 49% through Government route wherever it is likely to result in access to modern technology or for other reasons to be recorded.

The Defence Products List for the purpose of issuing Industrial Licenses (ILs) under IDR Act has been revised and most of the components, parts, sub-systems, testing equipment and production equipment have been removed from the list, so as to reduce the entry barriers for the industry, particularly small & medium segment.  The initial validity of the Industrial Licence granted under the IDR Act has been increased from 03 years to 15 years with a provision to further extend it by 03 years on the case-to-case basis.

The process for export clearance has been streamlined and made transparent & online.

Offset guidelines have been made flexible by allowing change of Indian Offset Partners (IOPs) and offset components, even in signed contracts.  Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are now not required to indicate the details of IOPs and products at the time of signing of contracts.  ‘Services’ as an avenue of offset have been re-instated.

                The closing session of the 12thCapacity Building Workshop Co-hosted by the Indian Coast Guard with the ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre was co-chaired by MrMasafumi Kuroki and Inspector General KR Suresh of Indian Coast Guard. 

While addressing the gathering IG KR Suresh said the capacity building continues to be a focus area for ReCAAP along with information sharing, as it enhances the professional knowledge of Focal Point staff in enabling the enforcement agencies for prompt response to crisis situations. The capacity building activities of ReCAAP have been a game changer in the fight against piracy and armed robbery not only in the region but also at a global level. The Information Sharing Centre which is now a Centre of Excellence has effectively steered the activities envisaged in the ReCAAP agreement and has significantly contributed in enhancing maritime security in the region.

            He also said a robust information sharing mechanism like the Information Network of ReCAAP, not only needs advanced technical solutions but also capable and trained personnel for optimal functioning. Regular have to operate within these limitations attempting a fine balance for securing national interest without infringing the legal provisions. 

The nations are increasingly recognising that the security threats in the oceans are more challenging than on land due to inherent geographical, technological and mobility constraints. Therefore, credible intelligence, well researched analysis supported by suitable preventive and response measures on land, are more significant to ensure greater success ratio in maritime arena. 

Inspector General KR Suresh said that proactive approach by the Indian Coast Guard in involving local police authorities of each coastal state in India has yielded excellent results. This has enabled drastic reduction in incidents of petty thefts off Kandla port as highlighted by various speakers.

                As a major initiative towards ‘Make in India’, the Government immediately on taking over has issued the Expression of Interest(s) for shortlisting of potential Indian Strategic Partners (SPs) for “Construction of six Conventional Submarines” for P-75(I) Project of the Indian Navy on 20 Jun 19. The project cost is about Rs 45,000 Crores. This is the second project being undertaken under the latest Strategic Partnership (SP) Model, with the first being the procurement of 111 Naval Utility Helicopters (NUH). This would provide a major boost to the indigenous design and construction capability of submarines in India, in addition to bringing in the latest submarine design and technologies as part of the project. The case was approved by the Defence Acquisition Council on 31 Jan 19. The EoI for shortlisting of Indian Strategic Partners has been uploaded on MoD and Indian Navy websites. The EoI for shortlisting of OEMs will be issued in two weeks. 

The SPs in collaboration with OEMs have been mandated to set up dedicated manufacturing lines for these submarines in India and make India the global hub for submarine design and production. All six submarines under this project will be built in India by the selected Indian Strategic Partner in collaboration with the selected OEM. In addition, Indian Navy would have the option to manufacture six more submarines under the project. The project would not only aid in boosting the core submarine/ ship building industry but would also greatly enhance manufacturing/ industrial sector, especially the MSMEs by development of an industrial eco-system for manufacture of associated spares/ systems/ equipment related to submarines.

The potential SPs are expected to respond to the EoI within two months. The Indian companies would be shortlisted based on their capability for integration of system of systems, expertise in shipbuilding domain and the financial strength. The OEMs would be shortlisted primarily based on their submarine design meeting the Indian Navy’s Qualitative Requirements and qualifying the Transfer of Technology and Indigenous Content (IC) criteria.

The overall aim would be to progressively build indigenous capabilities in the private sector to design, develop and manufacture complex weapon systems for the future needs of the Armed Forces. This will be an important step towards meeting broader national objectives, encouraging self reliance and aligning the defence sector with the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government.

                Additional Director General Indian Coast Guard (ICG) Shri VSR Murthy along with Executive Director of ReCAAP ISC Shri Masafumi Kuroki inaugurated a two-day 12th Capacity Building Workshop, here today.

In his inaugural address the Shri Murthy recognised the efforts of ReCAAP ISC towards developing the cooperative framework to address the menace of piracy and armed robbery and facilitating information exchange between various stakeholders. ADG ICG highlighted the fact that capacity building remains one of the most significant pillars of cooperation under the ReCAAP agreement and India has played a leading role in this aspect by hosting this workshop for a third time.

Executive Director of ReCAAP ISC Shri Masafumi Kuroki in his opening remarks appreciated the steps taken by Indian agencies especially by ICG in ensuring safe and secure seas for the seafarers. He also conveyed that information sharing is a shared responsibility of the governments and the shipping industry and the purpose of information sharing would be better served if it is accurate and shared in real time.

The workshop co-hosted by ICG and ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre was attended by officials of concerned ministries and members of the Diplomatic Corps. During the course of workshop, the participants will be trained on various issues related to piracy and armed robbery such as international laws, prosecution process, forensics and emerging threats.

The effort of the military’s tri service command to guard the nation’s sovereignty is truly invaluable. It is paramount to equip these soldiers with yogic tools for transformation.” said Sadhguru, ahead of the visit.

                Indian Coast Guard (ICG) will be co-hosting 12th Capacity Building workshop with Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) Information Sharing Centre (ISC) here on June 19-20, 2019.

The ReCAAP is the first regional Government-to-Government agreement to deal with piracy and armed robbery at sea in Asia. Presently 20 countries are members of ReCAAP. India played an active role in the setting up and functioning of ReCAAPISC along with Japan and Singapore. Union Government has designated ICG as the focal point within India for ReCAAP. India has hosted this workshop earlier in November 2011 at Goa and December 2017 at New Delhi.

Information sharing, capacity building and mutual legal assistance are the three pillars of co-operation under the ReCAAP agreement. An ISC has been established at Singapore to collate and disseminate the information among the contracting parties and the maritime community. Capacity building workshop is organised annually by the ISC and is co-hosted by one of the contracting parties. The main objective of this workshop is to share updated situation of piracy and armed robbery against ships in Asia and best practices of Asian countries. The workshop also aims to deepen the knowledge of participants on various issues related with piracy and armed robbery such as international laws, prosecution process, forensics and emerging threats.

A total of 31 International delegates from 19 countries will be participating in the workshop. In addition, officials from national stakeholders like major ports, state maritime boards, state marine police, Directorate General of Shipping and Indian National Ship-Owners Association are also participating in this workshop.

                Operations to retrieve the mortal remains of the personnel onboard the ill fated An-32 are on. The rescue team of 17 IAF, Army SF and civilian members is present at the crash site. The rescue operations are being curtailed due to incessant rains and heavy clouding. No helicopter could fly today due to bad weather.

Helicopter operations require great skill and caution, under such conditions, especially hovering at high altitudes and very close to the steep mountain slopes. Bad weather is hampering hovering by helicopters to do winching operations which are mandatory for all the rescue operations and recovery of mortal remains. All efforts are being made to heli-lift the mortal remains of the IAF personnel at the earliest to their parent base Jorhat. Rescue teams are standing by and operations will resume as soon as the weather improves.

                IAF mountaineers, Army Special Forces personnel and local mountaineers were dropped off at the closest possible location to the crash site and have reached the crash site. 

The mortal remains and other material evidence have to be picked up by helicopters and brought back to Jorhat in stages. The weather continues to be marginal and is likely to affect the pace of recovery operations. The recovery team is braving the treacherous terrain and inclement weather in order to bring back the mortal remains as soon as possible.

The IAF has flown around 200 sorties towards the AN-32 search and recovery operations and is sparing no efforts in recovering the remains of its personnel for which 08 helicopters have been deployed. 

The Next of Kins of all personnel on board had been informed of the crash and the subsequent search operations undertaken by the IAF. Concerned family members have been apprised of the progress of the recovery operations as well and IAF officials are in regular touch with them. The IAF and all its personnel stand with the families in this hour of grief.

                On 03 Jun 19,  an IAF AN-32 carrier aircraft with 13 people (eight aircrew and five passengers) onboard took off from Air Force Station, Jorhat Assam at 1227 hrs for Mechuka Advanced Landing Ground. Last contact with the aircraft was made at 1255 hrs. Once the aircraft did not report at the destination, overdue actions were initiated. In coordination with Indian Army, various government and civil agencies, IAF commenced extensive search operations under the direct supervision of Head Quarters Eastern Air Command. C-130J, AN-32, Mi-17 helicopters of IAF and ALH helicopters of Indian Army were launched immediately to locate the missing aircraft. Indian Navy P-8i aircraft joined the search operations on 04 Jun 19. Resources from various agencies, including ISRO were brought into the operation to enhance its effectiveness. CARTOSAT and RISAT satellites of ISRO also took images of the area, which assisted the search team in locating the aircraft. Thick vegetation, in hospitable terrain and inclement weather adversely affected the aerial search operation in the vast search zone. Despite the challenges posed by poor weather and terrain, IAF remained committed to the continued air and ground efforts throughout day and night to locate the missing aircraft and its brave air-warriors. Extensive support towards rescue operation was provided by Indian Army, Indian Navy, State Government, State Police and Local population.

 On 11 Jun 19, the wreckage of the aircraft was spotted 16 kms North of Lipo, North East of Tato, Arunachal Pradesh at an approximate elevation of 12000 ft by an IAF Mi-17 helicopter. Aerial operations were launched subsequently to the designated crash site however, due to steep slope and thick forest the helicopter could not land near the crash site. Two km from the designated crash site, an area was designated and a camp was established for helicopters to land with the recovery parties. On 12 Jun 19, a team of nine IAF personnel (including mountaineers), four Army Special Forces personnel and two local mountaineers were dropped at the campsite.

On 13 Jun 19, eight members of the rescue team reached the crash site in search of the survivors. Unfortunately no air-warrior survived the crash. Air-warriors who lost their life in the tragic accident crash are Wing Commander GM Charles, Squadron Leader H Vinod, Flight Lieutenant MK Garg, Flight Lieutenant S Mohanty, Flight Lieutenant A Tanwar, Flight Lieutenant R Thapa, Warrant Officer KK Mishra, Sergeant Anoop Kumar,  Corporal Sharin, Leading Aircraftman SK Singh, Leading Aircraftman Pankaj, NC(E) Putali and NC(E) Rajesh Kumar.

IAF pays tribute to the brave air-warriors who lost their life in the line of duty. IAF is making all efforts to recover the mortal remains. No effort is being spared in ensuring expeditious transfer of the mortal remains of the air-warriors to their parent base at Jorhat. A Court of Inquiry has been ordered to investigate the cause of accident.

                 A Maritime Information Sharing Workshop (MISW) is being hosted by the Indian Navy, under the aegis of the Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR), Gurugram. The workshop was inaugurated by Vice Admiral MS Pawar, the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff this morning. Over 41 delegates from 29 countries of the IOR and beyond are participating in the two-day event. The IFC-IOR was launched by the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri on 22 Dec 18, for furthering maritime security and safety in the region.

 

While delivering his opening address during the inauguration ceremony, the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff stressed on the need for greater maritime collaboration and forging of bonds based on trust, between partner countries in the region and requested the delegates to participate actively in the MISW. The Chief of the Malagasy Navy, Rear Admiral Vaohavy Andasy also addressed the delegates. A talk on ‘Contemporary Maritime Challenges in the Indo-Pacific’ highlighting the significance of the maritime domain and challenges faced by the region, was delivered by Vice Admiral Pradeep Chauhan (Retd), Director General, National Maritime Foundation. 



In the course of two days, the MISW aims to acquaint participants about IFC-IOR and its information sharing mechanisms and promote sharing of best practices in this field. This aims to yield better response to the myriad security and safety challenges that IOR faces. Towards this, participants would be exposed to issues such as maritime terrorism, piracy, human and drug trafficking, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; and the legal perspective of combating these challenges. The delegates would also participate in an information sharing exercise on 13 Jun 19 to practice and validate some of the concepts and procedures that have been evolved during the workshop.

                Security and safety of the seas in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is vital to world trade and the economic prosperity of many nations. The scale, scope and the multinational nature of activities at sea, necessitates a collaborative approach to maritime security.  Considering this, the Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean region (IFC-IOR), Gurugram was launched in Dec 18 by the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri for enhancing maritime safety and security in the region. The centre has thus far established linkages with more than 16 countries and 13 international maritime security agencies.

 

To facilitate sharing of best practices in maritime information sharing and better understand the maritime security challenges in the IOR, the Indian Navy is hosting a Maritime Information Sharing Workshop (MISW) from 12-13 Jun 19, at the IFC-IOR. Over 50 delegates from about 30 countries would be participating in the workshop. The event would include interactive sessions by subject matter experts from the participating countries, on issues such as maritime piracy, human and drug trafficking and the legal aspects of combating these challenges. A table top information sharing exercise would also be conducted as part of the workshop. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy would be inaugurating the workshop.

                The search for the missing Indian Air Force An-32 continued unabated today. On 3rd June, the aircraft had got airborne from IAF’s Jorhat Airbase in Assam for Mechuka Advanced Landing Ground in the West Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh. Indian Air Force launched a massive search operation to trace the whereabouts of the aircraft soon after it was established that it did not reach its destination within the stipulated time.

Resources from various agencies, including ISRO were brought into the operation to enhance its effectiveness. The area of search is mountainous and heavily forested with thick undergrowth. The weather in the area has been inclement with low clouds and rain during most hours. Combined with the inhospitable terrain, the weather has posed serious challenges to aerial search operations.

Search efforts by ground teams of Indian Army, ITBP, State Police and members of local population has continued in full force today. However, aerial search could not be undertaken due to poor weather conditions prevailing throughout the day. Indian Air Force has increased the deployment of its helicopters and transport aircraft and has expanded the search area significantly since the beginning of the operations. More and more area is being covered by airborne sensors and satellites and the imaging is being followed-up by close analysis of the data for its synergistic amalgamation in the search operations.

Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa visited Air Force Station Jorhat today to assess the ongoing search operations. He was given a detailed briefing about the operations and was apprised with the inputs received so far. He interacted with families of the officers and airmen who were onboard the aircraft.

                Manpower Planning (MP) Directorate, (MP 5&6) is responsible for custody and maintenance of approximately 1.2 Lakh service records of serving and retired officers of the Indian Army.  However, due to lack of digitisation and non-availability of latest address and contact details of veterans, connecting with veteran officers/family pensioners and addressing their grievances was a major challenge.

To over come the same a website Retired Officers Digital Records Archive (RODRA, https://rodra.gov.in) was launched. The aim was to establish an interface between the custodian of officers’ Records i.e AG/MP 5&6 and veteran officers/Next of Kin (NOK) and to create a digital data repository in order to address documentation/pension related grievances and update on relevant policies.

Some of the facilities extended to veterans through website are updation of records. Registration and tracking of documents/ pension related grievances. Communicating with veteran officers/ NOK on various issues.

After the launch of RODRA website various types of Pension Payment Order (PPOs) issued by PCDA (P) from time to time to veterans has now been discontinued thereby saving of manpower, stationery and postal charges.  The PPOs are now uploaded on the website and veterans are able to download it from the website. Monitoring and management of grievances of veterans has been streamlined thereby improving satisfaction levels.

Automation of the records of serving officers is also in progress.  An application has been developed and is being launched on the internal Army Portal in Jun 2019. This would facilitate serving officers to view their service and other records online as well as interact with AG/MP 5&6 on various Records/documentation related issues.

	Clean and Green Navy – Indian Navy pledges 1.5 % of its “Works” budget towards Renewable Energy generation
	Indian Navy Environment Conservation Roadmap (INECR) – Indian Navy has formulated specific plans covering the entire gamut of operations, maintenance, administration and infrastructure/ community living.
	24 MW of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) projects consisting of both Rooftop and Land based solar panels are under execution at various shore establishments of the Navy under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM).
	Indian Navy has taken up initiatives for sustained usage of biodiesel for all MT vehicles.  
	The Green Initiatives Programme would aid in boosting the national interests of environment sustainability and self-reliance in energy.


 

            Indian economy has seen unprecedented growth over the past two decades, which has spurred the energy demand. Being a responsible and mature nation, our Government policies have seen a paradigm shift in energy policy. The focus has been on reducing the carbon footprint by ways of using alternate sources of energy. 



            Towards achieving the goal of Clean and Green Navy, Indian Navy has formulated a plan - Indian Navy Environment Conservation Roadmap (INECR) with specific action plans covering the entire gamut of operations, maintenance, administration and infrastructure/ community living. The Roadmap envisions ‘Reduction in Energy Consumption’ and ‘Diversification of Energy Supply’ as the Key Result Areas. While the existing military, diplomatic, constabulary and benign roles envisioned in the Indian Navy’s Maritime Doctrine define the objectives of its operations, the Green Initiatives Programme of the Indian Navy has added a new dimension i.e. social responsibility to it. Under the INECR, numerous policies aimed at reduction of energy consumption and environment sustenance have been formulated and disseminated to all ships, as well as shore establishments. As a progressive step, Indian Navy has pledged 1.5% of its ‘Works’ Budget towards Renewable Energy generation.

 

            Solar photovoltaic (PV) projects has been one of the focus areas of the IN since the inception of the INECR. The efforts undertaken in the last few years have started to fructify now. 24 MW of Solar PV projects consisting of both Rooftop and Land based solar panels are under execution at various shore establishments of the Navy under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM). Similarly, pilot projects utilizing wind or a mix of both solar and wind (hybrid) are also being taken up progressively which will not only reduce carbon footprint but also help achieve self-sustenance in energy security. 



            IN has taken up initiatives for sustained usage of biodiesel for all MT vehicles. Continued usage of B5 blend of High Speed Diesel (HSD) for PAN Navy use in all Motor Transport vehicles is a step in this direction. IN plans to replace HSD (annual usage – 6300 kL) with B5 blend of HSD, which would accrue a direct savings of 5 per cent of HSD which translates to approximately 315 kL annual savings of HSD. The project to blend the HSD is planned to start at Visakhapatnam in the coming months. 

 

            Indian Navy has also focused attention towards addressing the menace of Air Pollution by way of various environmental remediation measures for mitigating it such as sapling plantation, arboriculture and horticulture, anti-plastic drive, effluent treatment plants etc which are an example of integration of the policies supported by concrete actions. During afforestation drives at Naval stations, more than 18000 plants have been planted over the past one year which are being nurtured by Naval personnel and would mitigate an estimated 365 tonnes of CO2. 

 

            Towards reduction in the energy consumption of all our bases and ships, focused attention has been paid towards use of renewable energy sources and institution of various energy conservation measures such as use of occupancy sensors, battery operated vehicles, solar street lights, LED lights, audit of yards, SCADA based electric metering  etc. Water Conservation at various Naval stations has been achieved through incorporation of drip irrigation technique, rain water harvesting, re-use of RO water and SCADA based water distribution system. 

 

            Segregated Waste Collection Centre (SWCC) was inaugurated with the support from Defence Wives Welfare Association (DWWA) at Port Blair, which incorporated modern methods of waste collection and management system. This has been one of the pioneering initiatives taken up by Indian Navy, which has facilitated the process of waste management for units based at Port Blair.

­

            Biogas Plant, Compost Pits, Vermi-culture, Paper Recycling Machine and Composter machine are some steps taken in Waste Management domain. An estimated savings of 140 LPG cylinders per year is accrued through implementation of biogas plant using bio-degradable waste and Organic Waste Converters across naval units. 

 

            Awareness drives and programmes by means of coastal cleanship, lectures etc are organized regularly to enhance participation and ensure better outreach amongst communities and contribute to the “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan”. 

 

            Emphasis is also being accorded to ensure that pollution is kept minimal in harbours and seas. Effluent treatment plants for neutralizing toxic waste prior discharge, utilization of Sullage Barges for collection of floatsam and induction of equipment which ensure compliance to MARPOL requirements though not mandated for men-of-war are some of the few steps taken to ensure for the purpose.

 

            Although a lot has been achieved in the last one year, Navy is furthering its march towards pursuance of the energy and environment goals of our country to ensure a greener and cleaner tomorrow for our future generations. The Green Initiatives Programme would aid in boosting the national interests of environment sustainability and self-reliance in energy.

                An AN-32 got airborne today from Jorhat at 1227 hrs for Mechuka Advanced Landing Ground. The aircraft last contacted ground agencies at 1300 hrs (approx). Thereafter, there was no contact with the aircraft. Since the aircraft did not reach the destination, overdue actions were initiated by Indian Air Force. A total of eight aircrew and five passengers were onboard the aircraft. C-130, AN-32 aircraft, two Mi-17 of IAF and Indian Army ALH helicopters were launched to locate the missing aircraft. Some ground reports were received on possible location of a crash site. Helicopters were routed to the location, however, no wreckage has been sighted so far. IAF is coordinating with Indian Army as well as various government and civil agencies to locate the missing aircraft. The search operations from air and by ground parties of Indian Army are planned to continue through the night.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) Dr Jitendra Singh met the MPs of  North East MPs Forum which included the newly elected MPs from Lok Sabha representing North Eastern states and the members of Rajya Sabha, here today. The purpose of the meeting was to brief the MPs about the ongoing schemes and future plans of the Government in the region. The Secretary (DoNER) Dr Inder Jit Singh, Secretary (North Eastern Council) Shri Ram Muivah and other senior officers of the Ministry were present during the meeting. 

Welcoming the MPs, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government will act for improving the lives of North Eastern people in close coordination with the elected representatives from the states of the region. He said that DoNER is the only region-based ministry in the Government. In the past five years, the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given due priority to the development of this region, he added. He said that the procedures laid down for DPRs have been simplified so as to expedite the execution of projects in the region and to curb the unnecessary delay. The Minister added that the Chief Ministers and Resident Commissioners of different states based in Delhi have been requested to coordinate with DoNER Ministry and follow up with the officials about the development projects of various states. He further said that then issues related to enhancement of budgetary allocation for development of North Eastern states are being discussed with the Finance Ministry.  Dr Jitendra Singh said that in departure from the earlier practice of 90:10 funding of Northeast projects under NLCPR flagship scheme of the Ministry, implying 90% funds from Centre and 10% from the respective State, the Union Cabinet has agreed that under the new scheme, North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS), the entire 100% of the funding is borne by the Centre, which results in a huge relief to the exchequer of the State Government and also puts an end to the frequent requests received from the State Governments about lack of funds for them to contribute their share. Speaking about another historic decision by the Cabinet, the Minister mentioned about the Indian Forest (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 to exempt bamboo grown in non-forest areas from the definition “Tree”, thereby dispensing with the requirement of obtaining a permit for felling of bamboo for economic use. He informed the members that, in July, 2018, the NEC was restructured through the nomination of the Home Minister as Chairman, NEC and the MoS (I/C) DoNER as the Vice-Chairman, NEC. Dr Singh said that that Union Minister Shri Amit Shah will chair the plenary session of NEC on 3rd and 4th August in Guwahati.

While giving his presentation about the functioning and role of DoNER Ministry,  the Secretary (DoNER) Dr Inder Jit Singh  said that DoNER Ministry plays a coordinating role to act as an interface between the NE states and Line Ministries. He added that DoNER is the only Ministry with territorial jurisdiction. He briefed that Chief Nodal Officers and Nodal officers have been appointed for each of the North Eastern states and line ministries. He also said that Inter-Ministerial committees have been constituted by DoNER Ministry for important sectors such as Roads, Civil Aviation & Tourism, Livlihood, Piggery, Medicinal & Aromatic Plants and Health & Nutrition. 

The Secretary briefed that members about the major schemes and organisations  of North eastern region such as North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS), Hill Area Development Programme (HIDP), North East Road Sector Development Scheme, North East Rural Livlihood Projects, North Eastern Region Community Resources Management Project, North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation Ltd., North East Handicrafts & Handlooms Development Corporation Ltd. etc. He informed members that each non-exempted Ministry has to allocate 10% of their Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) for the development of North Eastern states. He added that Rs 1,83,036 crore expenditure has been incurred by the non-exempted ministries plus Railways during the last 5 years, while the budget allocation for 2019-20 is Rs 56,530 cr. 

In addition to the above, A NITI Forum for North East has been set up in February, 2018. The first meeting of the forum took place on 10th April, 2018 at Agartala where constraints were identified for sustainable economic growth. The second meeting held on 4th December, 2018 at Guwahati made recommendations on the development of Bamboo, tea, dairy and tourism in North East. 

The MPs were briefed about the North Eastern Council (NEC), which was established in the year 1971. Since its inception, NEC has focused on improving connectivity of the region which has been a major bottleneck for all developmental activities. In its endeavour, the Council has contributed immensely towards the improvement of the inter-state connectivity in the Region. A total of 10,911 kms of roads have been constructed with the NEC funding and handed over to the States for maintenance. It has worked in the direction of setting up of eleven Inter-State Bus terminal (ISBT) projects, power plants and contributed for the up-gradation/strengthening of the infrastructure of the existing Airports in the region. 

During the interaction, the MPs discussed development related issues pertaining to their areas. They expressed pleasure at the fact that a Chief Nodal officer and a nodal officer has been nominated by the DoNER Ministry for their states and they expressed their wish to be briefed about the status of development projects of their areas on a regular basis. 

Following MPs from Lok Sabha attended the meeting: Shri Tapir Gao (East Siang, Arunachal Pradesh), Shri Kiren Rijiju (West Kameng, Arunachal), Shri Abdul Khaelque (Barpeta, Assam), Shri Rameswar Teli (Dibrugarh, Assam), Shri Dilip Saikia (Mangaldoi, Assam), Shri Gaurav Gogoi, (Kalibor, Assam), Shri Horen Sing Bey (Autonomous District, Assam), Shri Topon Kumar Gogoi (Jorhat, Assam), Shri Naba Kumar Sarania (Kokrajhar, Assam), Shri Kripanath Mallah (Karimganj, Assam), Shri Pallab Lochan Das (Tezpur, Assam), Smt Queen Oja (Guwahati, Assam), Shri Rajdeep Roy (Silchar, Assam), Shri Lorho S.

The Newsletter is to be uploaded on the NEC website at www.necouncil.gov.in.

While releasing the newsletter, Dr Jitendra Singh complimented the officers and staff of M/o DoNER and NEC for their efforts to improve the living condition of North Eastern States of the country. He said that under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the development of NE states has been on the priority of the Government. He added that the newly sworn-in Government is also committed to continue with the legacy of the development efforts of the last five years and work in the direction of improving infrastructure and living standards of NE people. In July, 2018, the NEC has been restructured through the nomination of the Home Minister as Chairman, NEC and the MoS (I/C) DoNER as the Vice-Chairman, NEC.  Dr Jitendra Singh dislosed that Union Minister Shri Amit Shah will chair the plenary session of NEC on 3rd and 4th August in Guwahati. 

The North Eastern Council (NEC) was established by North Eastern Council Act, 1971 initially as apex level advisory body for securing balanced and coordinated development and facilitating effective co-ordination amongst seven States of North Eastern Region. Subsequent to the amendment of NEC Act in December, 2002, Sikkim was added as 8th Member State, and NEC was mandated to function as a statutory Regional Planning Body for the North Eastern Region. 

Over the last forty-seven years, NEC has been instrumental in setting up various iconic Institutes in the Region such as NEPA, NEEPCO, NERAMAC, NERIST, RIPAN, NERIWALM, RIMS etc. 

Some of the major achievements of NEC are as under:


	Since its inception, NEC has focused on improving connectivity of the region which has been a major bottleneck for all developmental activities. In its endeavour, the Council has contributed immensely towards the improvement of the inter-state connectivity in the Region. A total of 10,911 kms of roads have been constructed with the NEC funding and handed over to the States for maintenance.
	NEC has till date supported the installation of 694.5 MW of power plants and construction of 9202 cicuit km of transmission & distribution lines.
	NEC has also undertaken development work in various sectors like education, healthcare, agriculture, horticulture, tourism, industries etc.
	Eleven Inter-State Bus terminus (ISBT) projects have been taken up across different States to ease out inter-state movement of people. Nine of these have been completed and two are under construction in Meghalaya and Manipur. To facilitate movement of essential goods, three numbers of Inter State Truck Terminus (2 in Assam and 1 in Nagaland) have been completed.
	Since inception, NEC has contributed for the up-gradation/strengthening of the infrastructure of the existing Airports in the region. Improvement of the infrastructure in 5 major airports of the Regions namely, Guwahati, Dibrugarh, Jorhat, Imphal and Umroi have been taken up in collaboration with Airport Authority of India on 60:40 (60% by NEC and 40% by AAI) basis. Out of these, the work for construction of 3 number of Hangers and Apron at LGBI Airport, Guwahati and Extension of Apron at Jorhat Airport have been completed.
	The restructuring of NEC was undertaken with a view to have a forum to discuss issues such as boundary disputes, drug trafficking, smuggling of arms and ammunition, etc. which are usually discussed in the other Zonal Councils. The NE States are not part of any Zonal Council.


The Council is normally expected to meet at least twice in a year. The first Plenary Meeting of Restructured NEC (67th  Plenary since inception) was held under the then Home Minister & Chairman, NEC on 8-9 July, 2018 at Shillong. The next Plenary meeting of NEC will be held in Guwahati (Assam) in August this year.

                The Governor of Sikkim, Shri Ganga Prasad called on Union DoNER Minister Dr Jitendra Singh here today and congratulated him for being sworn-in as Minister for Northeast for the second consecutive term.

 

Shri Ganga Prasad shared with the DoNER Minister the recent political developments in Sikkim.  During the meeting, the Governor also took up with the DoNER Minister the issue of newly opened Pakyong Airport at Sikkim which, according to him, required further extension to make it more functional and useful.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh informed the Governor that Sikkim had got its first airport after nearly 40 years and that too, with the personal intervention of  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi who had personally followed up the project through his weekly ""PRAGATI"" video conference meetings with the State authorities. He assured the Governor that he would discuss the remaining issues related to the Pakyong airport with the Aviation Ministry.

 

The Governor expressed his satisfaction for the overwhelming response of tourists to the State in the last few years. The income generated from the unprecedented tourist flow, he said, if utilized optimally, could prove a game-changer for several developmental activities in the State.

 

While assuring of all possible support to Sikkim from the Ministry of DoNER, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Railway authorities have also been approached to undertake the extension of rail-network in the State.

Some of the important projects in which Japan will collaborate include Guwahati Water Supply Project and Guwahati Sewage Project in Assam, Northeast Road Network Connectivity Improvement Project spread over Assam and Meghalaya, Northeast Network Connectivity Improvement Project in Meghalaya, Bio-diversity Conservation and Forest Management Project in Sikkim, Sustainable Forest Management Project in Tripura, Technical Cooperation Project for Sustainable Agriculture & Irrigation in Mizoram, Forest Management Project in Nagaland, etc.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the Japanese contribution to the development and transformation of the North-Eastern region in the last three to four years. He said, in the times to come, new areas of collaboration will also be sought to be worked out, which could possibly include Bamboo-related collaboration. Significantly, it was the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, which amended the 90-year old ""Indian Forest Act of 1919"" of the British Government to bring the home-grown Bamboo out of its purview, he added.

The hostel will be built in an area of about 5 acres. 

The status of the North Eastern Cultural and Information Centre to be set up in Dwarka in New Delhi, was also discussed during the meeting. The estimated cost of the project is about Rs. 50 crore. The Minister said that this Centre will act as a cultural and convention/information hub of the North Eastern Region in Delhi. It will be constructed at par with the international standards and will have a library-cum-reading room with material on North Eastern Region, an art gallery showcasing the North East.

Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the development of north eastern region has been the priority for the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The Government will make all efforts for the implementation of ongoing development projects in North East and will take measures to introduce new projects for the benefit of people of North East.

                Union Minister for Jal Shakti Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has said that Swachhata affects all aspects of the environment – be it groundwater, surface water, soil or air – as well as health and well-being of the communities in ODF regions. Praising the Swachh Bharat Mission for bringing a reduction in ground water contamination, he said, the WHO 2018 study had estimated that the Swachh Bharat Mission will save over 3 lakh lives by the time India is Open Defacation Free. Releasing two independent third-party studies conducted on the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), the Minister said, the Mission will continue to positively impact people’s lives for a long time to come.

These studies, commissioned by UNICEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates, were aimed at assessing the environmental impact and communication footprint of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) respectively. The full reports as well as the summary reports of both the studies can be downloaded from mdws.gov.in and sbm.gov.in.

Union Minister for Environment and Forests Shri Prakash Javadekar highlighted the significance of launching these studies on World Environment Day. He said that the United Nations, aware that the protection and improvement of the human environment is a major issue which affects the well-being of peoples and economic development throughout the world, designated 5th June as World Environment Day. He added that it is only fitting that UNICEF has chosen this day to release its findings on the positive impact the Swachh Bharat Mission has had on the environment of rural India.

Secretary, Government of India, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, in his opening remarks, shared that the rural sanitation coverage in the country had crossed the 99% mark and that the Mission was in the final stretch of its completion with 30 States and Union Territories already having declared themselves free from open defecation. He said that the Mission is focusing on sustaining the gains of this progress and to extend the momentum to the ODF-plus phase which includes solid and liquid waste management.

Summary of the study findings

Environmental Impact study by UNICEF

Under the ""Environmental impact of the Swachh Bharat Mission on Water, Soil, and Food"" by UNICEF, groundwater samples were collected and studied from ODF and non-ODF villages of Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal. The study found that, in terms of faecal contamination, non-ODF villages were, on average:


	11.25 times more likely to have their groundwater sources contaminated (12.7 times more from contaminants traceable to humans alone)
	1.13 times more likely to have their soil contaminated
	1.48 times more likely to have food contaminated and 2.68 times more likely to have household drinking water contaminated.


The study findings indicated that these substantial reductions may potentially be attributed to the improvement in sanitation and hygiene practices, as well as supportive systems such as regular monitoring and behaviour change messaging, which have all been critical aspects of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen).

IEC footprint study by Gates Foundation

The “Assessment of the reach and value of IEC activities under Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)” conducted by Dalberg, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, estimated the scale of IEC activities within the Mission and assessed associated monetary and in-kind costs, and outputs such as reach. The study found that:


	SBM mobilized a spend equivalent worth INR 22,000 to 26,000 crores in monetary and non-monetary IEC activities.
	Of this spend equivalent, cash expenditure on IEC activities spent by the Government, private sector, and the development community was estimated to be between INR 3,500 – 4,000 crores.
	Of this cash spend, ~20% (~INR 800 crores) was spent by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MDWS), ~35% (~INR 1,250 crores) by the State Sanitation Departments, ~25% (~INR 1,000 crores) by other government ministries, and the other ~20% by the private sector (CSR and business expenditures) and the development sector collectively.
	An average person living in rural India was exposed to between 2,500 – 3,300 SBM related messages over the last five years.

2.       The ten Expert Groups drawn from senior academicians, administrators and industrialists, have suggested more than 50 initiatives that would transform the higher education sector completely. The Groups have set the following goals for higher education sector:


	
	
		Double the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education and resolve the geographically and socially skewed access to higher education institutions in India
		Upgrade the quality of education to global standards
		Position at least 50 Indian institutions among the top-1000 global universities
		Introduce governance reforms in higher education for well-administered campuses
		Accreditation of all institutions as an   assurance of quality 
		Promote Research & Innovation ecosystems for positioning India in the Top-3 countries in the world in matters of knowledge creation
		Double the employability of the students passing out of higher education
		Harness education technology for expanding the reach and improving pedagogy
		Promote India as a global study destination 
		Achieve a quantum increase in investment in higher education
	
	


 

3.       For each initiative, the Groups have recommended modalities for implementation, investments and timelines. The proposal would now be taken for inter-departmental consultations and appraisal through the EFC mechanism before being taken to Cabinet for approval.

                Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' congratulated O.P. Jindal Global University for breaking into QS World University Rankings 2020 for the first time ever, during a meeting with the founding Vice Chancellor of O.P. Jindal Global University (JGU), Prof. (Dr.) C. Raj Kumar and the Dean of Jindal School of Banking & Finance, Prof. (Dr.) Ashish Bharadwaj. 

 



(Vice Chancellor Prof. C. Raj Kumar presenting the QS Certificate of Achievement (for Entry into QS World University Rankings 2020) to the Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'

 

Vice Chancellor Professor Raj Kumar presented the QS Certificate of Achievement awarded to JGU for being ranked between 751-800 globally and being the youngest university in the world to enter the world rankings.This is a huge achievement for O.P. Jindal Global University as they celebrate their tenth anniversary this year.

Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal said that historically India has always given primacy to knowledge creation and learning, which has shaped our Indian society in profound ways. Leading centres of excellence and learning have flourished in ancient India and now the Government of India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, has placed importance on Indian universities to excel globally. We encourage JGU to take the lead in mentoring other institutions and universities in aiming for global excellence in teaching, learning and research.

The Minister praised O.P. Jindal Global University for being the only new entrant from India and the youngest university globally to enter the QS World University Rankings. The Minister was delighted that JGU is now amongst the top 2.67% of all 28000 universities globally. The fact that JGU is the only university in India dedicated to the study and research of the social sciences, arts & humanities to break into the QS World University Rankings is remarkable and I congratulate the JGU leadership and faculty for showing a path to academic excellence to all universities in India that have global ambitions. 

Out of roughly 28,000+ universities and higher education institutions in the world, only 1,001 were ranked by QS in terms of their performance criteria. 50 universities are new entrants in the world university rankings. While in the last ten years, several older colleges and institutes, particularly in France, Finland and elsewhere in Europe have recently merged to form new universities, JGU or any of its constituent schools did not exist in any form prior to 2009, making JGU the youngest university in the world to break into the latest edition of QS World University Rankings.

                The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 provides for free and compulsory elementary education of equitable quality to all children, including the children of migrant workers,  of 6-14 years age.  The RTE Act provides for norms and standards for opening of schools in neighbourhood at elementary level.  Section 6 of the Act mentions that ‘The appropriate government and local authorities’ shall establish, with in the area or limits of a neighbourhood, a school, where it is not already established, within a period of three years from the commencement of the Act. Further, the Act places a compulsion on the State to ensure that no child from the weaker sections or disadvantaged groups is discriminated against in any manner or prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education.

Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) was designated as a vehicle programme for universalization of elementary education up-to 2017-18, which was implemented in coordination with the States and UTs.  Now, the provisions of RTE Act are implemented through the Samagra Shiksha which subsumes the erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of SSA, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE).

Under the scheme since its inception, approval has been given for setting up 2.04 lakh primary and 1.59 lakh upper primary schools across the country. In addition to regular schools, 1,020 residential facilities with sanctioned capacity of 1,08,275 has been sanctioned to States. It includes 333 residential schools and 687 hostels attached with existing schools for children living in remote and sparsely populated habitations of rural and deprived children of urban areas. These residential facilities are in addition to 5,970 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs, Girls residential school at upper level) with a total capacity of 7.25 lakh girls have also been sanctioned to the states for improving access to marginalised girls.

Further, to address the issue of seasonal migration for varying periods, States are using various strategies which are supported by Government of India under Samagra Shiksha. All States and UTs are required to conduct household surveys/ update household surveys annually to identify out of school children. These surveys also collect information on children affected by migration of their families.   In order to ensure provision of elementary education to these children, various interventions are supported under Samagra Shiksha such as provision of seasonal hostels/residential camps in villages during the period of migrations of families, residential and non-residential special training centres for out of school, dropout and migrant children, besides provision of mid-day meal, free textbooks and free uniforms as per norms of the scheme.

                The Government has adopted an elaborate monitoring mechanism at Central, State and District levels to ensure quality food is served to children under the Scheme. At national level, an Empowered Committee, headed by Minister of Human Resource Development and also a National level Steering-cum-Monitoring Committee (NSMC) as well as Programme Approval Board (PAB) monitor the scheme and suggest measures for its smooth and effective implementation. At the State level, a State level Steering–cum-Monitoring Committee headed by the State Chief Secretary and, at the District Level, a District Level Committee under the Chairpersonship of the senior-most Member of Parliament of Lok Sabha of the district monitors the implementation of the scheme in the concerned District.  

At local level Gram Panchayats/Gram Sabhas, members of Village Education Committees (VECs), Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) and the School Management Committees (SMCs) monitor the regularity and wholesomeness of the mid-day meal served to children, cleanliness in cooking and serving of the meal, timeliness in procurement of good quality ingredients, fuel, etc., implementation of variety in menu so as to make it attractive to children and ensuring social and gender equity on daily basis. In addition to directing States and UTs to carry out Social Audit, the Centre constitutes Joint Review Missions (JRMs) consisting of educational and nutritional experts, which review the scheme through field visits from time to time.  The reports of JRMs are shared with concerned States and UTs for taking suitable action on the findings. 

The Government of India has issued guidelines on quality, safety and hygiene in school level kitchens to all the States and UTs in order to meet the nutritional standard of 450 calories and 12 gms of protein to children in primary classes and 700 calories and 20 gms of protein to children in upper primary classes. These guidelines inter-alia provide for instructions to schools to procure Agmark quality and branded items for preparation of mid day meals, tasting of meals by 2-3 adult members of School Management Committee including at least one teacher before serving to children and to put in place a system of testing of food samples by accredited laboratories. Further, the MDM Rules, 2015 provide for mandatory testing of food samples by Government recognized laboratories to ensure that the meals meet nutritional standards and quality.

                The Government is committed to ensure adequate representation and admission of students from poor economic backgrounds. In this regard, for advancement of Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of the society, and in accordance with the Constitution 103rd Amendment Act 2019, this Ministry has issued instructions providing 10 percent reservation to EWS categories for admission in Central Educational Institutions (CEIs). This reservation for EWS categories would be provided without disturbing the existing entitlements for SC/ST and OBC categories.

The above reservation is being provided from the academic year 2019-20 onwards in Central Educational Institutions, and would help in creating more than 2 lakh additional seats.  

The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 provides for free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years. The Act requires all private schools to reserve 25% of seats to children from poor families.

Further, Samagra Shiksha - an Integrated Centrally Sponsored Scheme for School Education has been launched throughout the country, as on overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII. This scheme aims towards ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. This programme subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE) and provides for universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education.

In the Indian Institute of Technology (IITs), subsidy is provided to the students enrolled for Under Graduate programmes. Full fee waiver is provided in respect of Scheduled Castes /Scheduled Tribes /Physically Handicapped students and most economically backward students whose family income is less than Rs.1 lakh per annum; and two third fee remission to other economically backward students whose family income is between Rs.1 lakh to 5 lakh per annum.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development is implementing the Central Sector Interest Subsidy Scheme for welfare of the students from rural areas with poor economic backgrounds.

The scheme aims to ensure that no one from the Economically Weaker Sections, including minorities, SCs/STs, women and disabled, is denied access to professional education only for the reason that he or she is poor. Under the Scheme, full interest subsidy is provided during the moratorium period (course period plus one year), on the educational loan up to Rs. 7.5 lakh, taken by the students having annual parental income up to Rs.4.5 lakh. 

The Government is regularly monitoring the creation of seats for EWS categories in the CEIs. In order to prevent commercialization of education and protect the interests of the poor students the UGC (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2017 have been notified.

                The Central Government has taken several initiatives to assess and improve the quality of teaching in the country as follows:

(i)         In order to focus on quality education, the Central rules to the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 have been amended to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. These would serve as a guideline for State and UTs to ensure that all children acquire appropriate learning level. 

(ii)        The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) conducts periodic national surveys of learning achievement of children in classes III, V, VIII and X. Four rounds of National Achievement Survey (NAS) have been conducted so far for class V and three rounds for classes III & VIII. These reveal improvement in learning achievement levels of pupils, in identified subjects from first round to fourth round. Further, a National Achievement Survey based on learning outcomes was conducted for Classes III, V and VIII on 13th November, 2017 with a sample frame upto district level to enable states/UTs to identify gaps in learning outcomes at district level and design strategies to address those gaps. Similarly, NAS for Class X was conducted on 5th February, 2018. NAS Reports show students’ learning levels against the expected learning outcomes of a particular grade and are used to provide feedback to the districts for further improvement. 

 (iii)      Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period of in-service training for untrained elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019 in all the States and UTs. As per the above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government- aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) was entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has been started from 3rd October, 2017 and completed on 31st March, 2019.

(iv)       A four year B.Ed integrated course to bring about qualitative improvement in teacher education programmes in India has been conceptualised and regulations for this course have been published in official gazette on 29th March, 2019 and applications have been invited w.e.f. 3rd June, 2019. The model curriculum prepared for this course includes crucial aspects like Gender, Inclusive education, ICT, Yoga, Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Health & Sanitation. The teaching specialization would primarily be for the primary levels and the secondary level. 

(v)        The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2018 has been notified on 11th January, 2019. The said Act provides to empower the appropriate Government to take a decision as to whether to hold back a child in the 5th class or in the 8th class or in both classes, or not to hold back a child in any class till the completion of elementary education. The Act seeks to improve the learning levels of children and will lead to greater accountability and improvement in the quality of education. 

(vi)       The Central Government has launched an integrated scheme for school education named as Samagra Shiksha, w.e.f. 2018-19 which subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored schemes of school education i.e  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), and Centrally Sponsored Scheme on Teacher Education (CSSTE). The common objectives of all these Schemes were to enhance access, to promote equity through the inclusion of disadvantaged groups and weaker sections and to improve the quality of education.  The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels.

(vii)      Government of India has decided to participate in the Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) to be conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2021. PISA is a competency based assessment which unlike content based assessment, measures the extent to which students have acquired key competencies that are essential for full participation in modern societies. Learnings from participation in PISA help to introduce competency based examination reforms in the school system and help move away from rote learning. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and NCERT are part of the process and activities leading to the actual test. 

(viii)     In order to experience and celebrate the rich cultural diversity of India, Rangotsav was held from 7th to 21st December, 2018 in schools, with participation of students, teachers and other stake holders. Rangotsav is focused on creating a non-judgmental platform for the participants to explore and express their artistic minds through dance, music, theatre, painting craft making etc. The fortnight-long event promoted a joyful learning environment with no restriction on expression of different forms of arts. It is a gate way for each state to get exposed to the cultures, arts and languages of other States and UTs and enrich the minds of students and enhance their thrust for knowledge. 

(ix)       In order to objectively evaluate the performance of the school education system in the States/UTs, MHRD has designed a 70 indicators based matrix called Performance Grading Index (PGI) to grade the States and UTs. The indicators have been chosen after detailed stakeholder consultation and the information on these indicators is drawn from the inputs provided by the respective States and UTs. This grading system will assist the States and UTs to identify the gap and design appropriate interventions to bridge them.

(x)        Timely and accurate data is the basis of sound and effective planning and decision making. Towards this end, the establishment of a well-functioning and sustainable Educational Management Information System is of utmost importance today. In 2018-19, the UDISE+ (i.e. UDISE plus) application has been launched to collect data from all schools, so that it becomes an effective tool for decision making.

(xi)       In order to provide supplementary learning material for students and for upgrading the skills of teachers, MHRD has developed a dedicated Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA) platform. The high quality e-learning material both for students and teachers are uploaded by Ministry and States/UTs on this portal. This is expected to substantially augment the knowledge base of the students and technical skills of teachers at no additional cost. 

(xii)      The Government has launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group of 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities. The Central Government also supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely ‘Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat’ (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling. 

(xiii)     A single point repository of e resources called e- PATHSHALA containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-print materials.

(xiv)     MHRD has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9th July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT is developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII.  Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(xv)      A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. Central Institute of Educational Technology (CIET)-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Senior Secondary levels and for sign language.

She further informed that the awareness about yoga is increasing as 32 states and Union Territories have participated this year as against 28 in 2018. This time two states Lakshdweep and Mizoram could not participated due to some unavoidable reasons. Hopefully all the States/UTs will be able to participate in the coming year.

The purpose is to create positive attitude among all human beings and promote peaceful living together in the society. Yoga has found an important place in the school curriculum as a  part of Health and Physical Education. It is not only for physical development but mental, spiritual and emotional development which also reduces stress. That is why the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has emphasised to promote yoga among school children. This Olympiad will create a sense of unity and understanding among children, who have travelled from different parts of the country – both from rural and urban areas.

Yoga is a means as well as an end for promoting holistic health, said Professor Saroj Yadav, Dean(Academic), NCERT.  She informed that this year 567 students from 33 States/UTs including CBSE, KVS and NVS and 4DMS of RIEs of NCERT are participating in the Olympiad as compared to the participation of 431 students from 28 States/UTs last year. She further emphasized that Yoga helps in improving physical fitness, mental alertness and emotional stability by developing healthy habits and life style. Prof. Yadav added that for the first time, the competition includes entries from CBSE, KVS and NVS.

After witnessing a mesmerizing yoga performance by young students from Demonstration Multipurpose Schools (DMS) from RIEs Ajmer and Bhubaneswar, the Chief Guest, Mr. Eric Falt, stated that UNESCO is proud to associate itself with the International Yoga Day. He added that yoga has been inscribed on the UN representative list of intangible Cultural Heritage. He said that education has become overly competitive and stressful, but the practice of yoga would lead to physical, mental and emotional well- being. Mr. Falt reiterated that yoga goes beyond gender, culture, language, age and ability.

The book title ‘Health and Physical Education – A Teachers Guide Class VIII” was released on the occasion by the guests.

                The Minister of Human Resource Development, Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ held another review meeting of the schemes and programmes of HRD Ministry in New Delhi today. Secretary, Higher Education Shri R. Subrahmanyam and the senior officers of the Ministry gave presentation on (i) Generation of skills and employment through vocational education, (ii) working of IIMs and setting up of new IIMs (iii) Study in India programme and international cooperation in the field of education (iv) Review of working of language councils. 



During the review meeting, Dr. Pokhriyal highlighted the importance of quality education and the need to create as many vocational courses as possible in order to push the youth into the employment stream without delay. The Minister advised the officers to set up a definite target of employment generation through these courses and also to  customize these courses region-wise by providing proper linkages with industry and trade plus other employment opportunities available in that particular region. The skill and education should be given as per the aptitude which should be identified at an early stage, the Minister added. The Minister was briefed about the new vocational courses designed by the Ministry to cater the requirements of industry.

The HRD Minister asked the officers to prepare an action plan on how the various Indian languages across the country can be developed in an integrated manner. We should also try to do further research in the wealth of knowledge hidden in our ancient texts and integrate them with modern day science, the Minister opined. He directed that the foundation stone of the six IIMs, which are in pipeline, should be laid at the earliest.

Commenting on Study in India programme, the HRD Minister said that India-centric courses should be started to attract foreign students. Branding of these courses should be undertaken, for example in the field of yoga, spirituality, ayurveda among others since these are specific to India and have a great potential. 

Earlier yesterday, the HRD Minister at an eight hour long meeting, reviewed the working of School Education, Higher Education and plan for filling up of vacancies, quality initiatives of UGC and quality initiatives of AICTE. The Minister also reviewed the working of IITs, IIITs, IIMs and CBSE.

                In a major move aimed at making Aadhaar making people friendly, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved “The Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2019” to replace the Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019. The amendments proposed are the same as those contained in the Ordinance promulgated by President on 2nd March, 2019.  The Bill will be introduced in ensuing session of Parliament.

The decision is expected to go a long way in meeting the people friendly and citizen centric nature of Aadhaar.

Impact:


	The decision would enable UIDAI to have a more robust mechanism to serve the public interest and restrain the misuse of Aadhar.  
	Subsequent to this amendment, no individual shall be compelled to provide proof of possession of Aadhaar number or undergo authentication for the purpose of establishing his identity unless it is so provided by a law made by Parliament.  
	For the convenience of general public in opening of bank accounts, the proposed amendments would allow the use of Aadhaar number for authentication on voluntary basis as acceptable KYC document under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.


Details:

The salient features of the amendments are as follows—


	Provides for voluntary use of Aadhaar number in physical or electronic form by authentication or offline verification with the consent of Aadhaar  number holder;
	Provides for use of twelve-digit Aadhaar number and its alternative virtual identity to conceal the actual Aadhaar number of an individual;
	Gives an option to children who are Aadhaar number holders to cancel their Aadhaar number on attaining the age of eighteen years;
	Permits the entities to perform authentication only when they are compliant with the standards of privacy and security specified by the Authority; and the authentication is permitted under any law made by Parliament or is prescribed to be in the interest of State by the Central Government;
	Allows the use of Aadhaar number for authentication on voluntary basis as acceptable KYC document under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002;
	Proposes deletion of section 57 of the Aadhaar Act relating to use of Aadhaar by private entities;
	Prevents denial of services for refusing to, or being unable to, undergo authentication;
	Provides for establishment of Unique Identification Authority of India Fund;
	Provides for civil penalties, its adjudication, appeal thereof in regard to violations of Aadhaar Act and provisions by entities in the Aadhaar ecosystem.


 

Background:

The Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 was considered by the Cabinet in its meeting held on 28th February, 2019 and the Ordinance was promulgated by the President on 2nd March, 2019.

The Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 amongst other things envisaged strengthening of the Aadhaar Act as per the directions of the Supreme Court and recommendations of Justice B.N.Srikrishna(Retd)  Committee.

                In a major decision, the Union Environment Ministry has today given two years of extension and allowed the construction works related to Polavaram Multipurpose Project. Informing the media in New Delhi the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri Prakash Javadekar said that today the order has been signed and ministry has allowed the construction works for two years. 

The Union Minister stressed that Polavaram project is very important to the people of Andhra Pradesh as it will irrigate nearly 3 lakh ha of land, generate hydel power with installed capacity of 960 MW and provide drinking water facilities to 540 enroute villages covering 25 lakh populations, particularly in Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari and Krishna Districts. 

In the year 2011 the then government had asked the Government of Andhra Pradesh to stop construction work of the project but in the year 2014 the NDA government declared the Polavaram project a National project and the ministry kept the “Stop Work Order” in abeyance to allow the construction works. The “Stop Work Order” has been kept in abeyance six times for a year each time. Considering the immense importance of the project this time the Ministry is keeping the “Stop Work Order” in abeyance to allow the construction works for two years without permission to impound water. 

The Project envisages construction of Earth-cum-Rock fill dam across river Godavari. The maximum height of the dam is 48 m.

                Union Environment Minister today said that we as a country make targets not under any global pressure but for our own country’s real sustainable development, and as in the past India will play a leadership role and will lead by example in combating desertification. Speaking at an event in New Delhi on the occasion of World Day to combat desertification and drought Shri Javadekar announced that India will be hosting the fourteenth session of Conference of Parties (COP - 14) from 29th August – 14th September 2019.

The Union Minister further highlighted that with about 30% of country’s total geographical area being affected by land degradation; India has high stakes and stands strongly committed to the Convention. Shri Javadekar said that various schemes have been launched by the Government of India such as: Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Soil Health Card Scheme, Soil Health Management Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PKSY), Per Drop More Crop, , etc. which are helping to reduce land degradation. The Union Minister also unveiled the logo of COP-14 on the occasion.



CEO , NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant who was also present on the occasion said that the World Day to combat desertification is a unique occasion to remind global community that desertification can be effectively tackled, that solutions are possible, and that key tools to this aim lay in strengthened community participation and cooperation at all levels. Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri C.K. Mishra said that The World Day to Combat Desertification (WDCD) in 2019 will retrospect and celebrate the past years of progress made by India on sustainable land management.

The Union Minister also launched a flagship project on enhancing capacity on forest landscape restoration (FLR) and Bonn Challenge in India, through a pilot phase of 3.5 years implemented in the States of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Nagaland and Karnataka. Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in partnership with The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), through this flagship project aims to develop and adapt best practices and monitoring protocols for the Indian states and build capacity within the five pilot states on FLR and Bonn Challenge. This will be eventually scaled up across the country through subsequent phases of the project. 

The Bonn Challenge is a global effort to bring 150 million hectares of the world’s deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2020, and 350 million hectares by 2030.At the UNFCC Conference of the Parties (COP) 2015 in Paris, India also joined the voluntary Bonn Challenge pledge to bring into restoration 13 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by the year 2020, and additional 8 million hectares by 2030. India’s pledge is one of the largest in Asia.

United Nations has 3 Rio Conventions namely, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Established in 1994, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is the only legally binding international agreement linking environment and development issues to the land agenda. In 1994, the United Nations General Assembly declared 17 June the ""World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought"" to promote public awareness and the implementation of the UNCCD in the desertification affected countries. 

India is hosting the Fourteenth session of Conference of Parties (COP - 14) from 29th August - 14th September 2019 at India Expo Mart Limited, Greater Noida. One of the primary functions of the COP is to review reports submitted by the Country Parties detailing how they are carrying out their commitments. India will take-over the COP presidency from China for two years until the next COP is hosted in 2021.

 

Over 5,000 representatives from over 197 countries drawn from national, regional and local governments, science and research communities, the private sector, international and non-governmental organizations and all forms media will address the issue of combating desertification, land degradation and drought during the two-week event.

Later interacting with the media, the Union Minister stressed that ‘Jan Bhagidari’ is integral towards tackling the environmental issues and the environment protection has to be a people’s movement. “For the amount of oxygen an individual requires, he should plant at least 8-10 saplings in his lifespan”, stressed the Union Minister.

Union Minister also praised the commitment of Union Transport Minister Shri Nitin Gakari for pledging to plant 125 crore trees on both sides of National Highways, which runs through thousands of kilometers across the country.

The World Environment Day (WED) urges governments, industries, communities and individuals to come together to explore renewable energy, green technologies and improve air quality in cities and regions across the world. The celebration of this day provides us with an opportunity to broaden the basis for an enlightened opinion in preserving and enhancing the environment. World Environment Day is the biggest annual event for positive environmental action and takes place every year on 5th June.

World Environment Day 2019 is being hosted by China this year with a theme of “Air Pollution”. Air pollution is the biggest environmental health risk of our time. Airborne pollutants are responsible for about one third of deaths from stroke, chronic respiratory disease, and lung cancer, as well as one quarter of deaths from heart attack. Air pollution is also fundamentally altering our climate, with profound impacts on the health of the planet. India hosted the last year’s World Environment Day emphasizing on prevention of ‘Plastic Pollution’.

Some Air Pollution Facts


	92 percent of people worldwide do not breathe clean air.
	Air pollution costs the global economy $5 trillion every year in welfare costs
	Ground-level ozone pollution is expected to reduce staple crop yields by 26 percent by 2030.


India has formulated and launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). This is a long term  and time bound national level strategy to tackle the increasing pollution problem across the country. The objective of NCAP is comprehensive plan for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution besides augmenting the air quality monitoring network. The tentative national level target is reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 20% – 30% by 2024. The focus of this year WED is on the identified 102 Non attainment cities across the country.

                The second anniversary of Good & Services Tax (GST) will be celebrated tomorrow with Hon’ble Union Minister of State of Finance and Corporate Affairs Shri Anurag Thakur presiding over the event.

Shri Subhash C. Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, Revenue Secretary, Secretaries of the Ministries of Finance, Shri P.K. Das, Chairman CBIC, Members of CBIC, and senior officers of various Ministries of Government of India will also attend the event. Senior functionaries of the apex chambers of commerce, trade and industry will also be present in large numbers. Similar functions will be held across the country in all States and Union Territories. 

GST was launched on the 1st July, 2017 in a majestic ceremony held in the Central Hall of Parliament on the midnight of 30th June, 2017. Hence, the Government alongwith partners from the trade and industry is celebrating the 2nd Anniversary of GST on 1st July 2019.

However, the implementation of GST has not been without challenges especially in the early months. But thanks to the cooperation of the Trade and Industry and the yeoman service rendered by the GST authorities of the States and the CBIC, these challenges have been overcome and GST has now settled down. Hence, the Government is commemorating the true spirit of Growing and Sharing Together (GST). 

At the event a book on “GST for MSME” will also be released. The distinguished officers of CBIC who have put in hard work in the implementation of GST will be awarded ‘GST Commendation Certificates’ by the Union Minister of State Shri Anurag Thakur.

 

Some advantages of GST:

 


	Simplified Tax Structure: Reduction in cascading effect of taxes, transparent and has harmonisation of laws and procedures.
	Easy Compliance: compliance burden has come down with one pan-India tax replacing multiple taxes and automated processes.
	Promoting Trade and Industry:  Seamless flow of tax credit.
	Spurring Economic Growth: Creation of unified common national market.
	 


Some developments during the GST journey since 2017:

 


	Subsuming of taxes: It was new experience of subsuming 17 different types of taxes under GST. Pre – GST, Trade & Industry had to undergo compliances under Central Excise, Service Tax & VAT and doing business in multiple states involved adhering to different VAT laws, compliance through different portals and answering to different authorities. All that has been unified into a single robust online system. Starting up has become simple with one-stop online GST registration for wanting to do business anywhere in the country.
	Formalisation of economy: More and more businesses moving in the formal economy is evident from the significant increase in the GST taxpayer base. Moving to the formal economy has brought in more visibility and hence more opportunities for Trade and Industry. 
	State borders: The State boarders’ glitches and delays have come down significantly. Due to different VAT laws in different states, inter-state transactions were a pain for Trade and Industry. CST charged on inter-state transactions were an additional cost with no input-credit available and thousands of productive hours were wasted at state border crossings. Cost and time of doing inter-state transactions have come down significantly after implementation of E – way bill.
	Rate Rationalisation: Major changes in the Tax rates of various items whereby 28% items pulled to 18%, 18% items pulled to 12% & 12% items pulled to 5%. Further various essential goods were made tax free. Mostly goods are unbranded and manufactured by MSMEs. The reduction in almost all the cases has been from the higher to the immediately lower tax slab (whether from 12% to 5% or 18% to 12%) and involves indigenously processed foods, man-made textile yarn, stationery and other job-work items.
	Return filing: The original concept of four Tax returns in a month (GSTR-3B, 1, 2 & 3) was gradually curtailed to two tax returns viz: GSTR-3B & 1. Further the Govt. extended due dates for filing tax returns as and when felt necessary. Quarterly Returns were also prescribed for small taxpayers. Reduction in the late fee payable for delay in filing tax returns from Rs 200/- per day to Rs 50/-per day /Rs 20/- per day. For the Trade and Industry whose turnover was turnover below five crores, quarterly return filling system is proposed. This will benefit 93% of the taxpayers, reduce their compliance burden and increase ease of doing business.  
	Exports & Refunds: Exports are made possible on the basis of Bond/LUT and without payment of IGST tax. A major package for exporters / merchant exporters has been announced after discussions with various Export Promotion Councils & organizations like FIEO, APEC, GJEPC, EEPC, Handicraft EPC etc. Refund Fortnights were conducted on 15th March to 31st March, 2018, 31st May to 14th June, 2018 and 16th July to 30th July, 2018.
	GST Law Amendment Act, 2018: In its 28th meeting of GSTC held in New Delhi on 21.07.2018, the GST Council recommended certain amendments in the CGST Act, IGST Act, UTGST Act and the GST (Compensation to States) Act. In order to ensure that the changes in the Centre and the State GST laws are brought into force simultaneously, these amendments are made effective from 01.02.2019.
	MSME support and outreach programme: With effect from 2nd November 2018 GST Help desks were created by CBIC  at 80 places all over the India to support MSMEs and hand holding of MSMEs was done with regard to GST Registration / Return Filing / Refunds / E – way bill etc. 


 

Further reforms in current fiscal (2019-20): 

 


	 
	New return system: Introduction of New Return System on trial basis from 01.07.2019 and on mandatory basis from 01.10.2019. SAHAJ & SUGAM Returns for small taxpayers are proposed
	Single Cash Ledger: Rationalisation of Cash Ledger in such a manner that earlier 20 heads are merged into 5 major heads. There is only one Cash Ledger for Tax , interest, penalty, fee & others . 
	Single Refund Disbursing: The Central or State Government which sanctions refund disburses all four major heads of refunds namely CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess.
	Threshold limit for goods: Threshold Limit of Rs 40 Lacs is offered of suppliers of goods as per the choice of States. 
	Composition Scheme for Services: Composition Scheme for small service providers up to annual turnover of Rs 50 lacs with a tax rate of 6%
	E-invoicing system: Electronic invoicing system in a phase-wise manner for B2B transactions is proposed to be introduced.
	GSTAT: GST Appellate Tribunals are being established at various State Headquarters and area benches also.


 

The introduction of GST is a game changer for Indian economy as it has replaced multi-layered, complex indirect tax structure with a simple, transparent and technology–driven tax regime. It has integrated India into a single, common market by breaking barriers to inter-State trade and commerce. By eliminating cascading of taxes and reducing transaction costs, it will enhance ease of doing business and provide an impetus to ‘Make in India’ campaign.

                The Government of India, the Government of Kerala and the World Bank signed here today a Loan Agreement of USD 250 million for the First Resilient Kerala Program to enhance the State's resilience against the impacts of natural disasters and climate change. 

The 2018 floods and landslides in Kerala led to severe impact on property, infrastructure, and lives and livelihoods of people. One sixth of the State’s population - about 5.4 million people - were affected while 1.4 million were displaced from their homes, especially the poor and vulnerable segments of the population. 

The Resilient Kerala Program will focus on strengthening the State's institutional and financial capacity to protect the assets and livelihoods of poor and vulnerable groups through an inclusive and participatory approach. 

Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India said that the New Program is part of the Government of India’s support to Kerala’s ‘Rebuild Kerala Development Programme’ aimed at building a green and resilient Kerala. He said that this partnership will identify key areas of policy and institutional strengthening to maximize development impact.  

The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare on behalf of the Government of India, and Mr. Junaid Kamal Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank India. 

The World Bank has been working closely with the Government of India and Kerala since the floods struck in August 2018 in assessing the impact of the floods and assisting in recovery and reconstruction. The Bank support also helped identify policies, institutions and systems for resilience to disaster risks and climate change. 

The Program, which represents the First ‘State Partnership’ of the World Bank in India, is the First of two Development Policy Operations aiming to mainstream disaster and climate resilience into critical infrastructure and services. 

Mr. Junaid Kamal Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank India said that .State partnership is a key pillar of the Bank’s new Country Partnership Framework for India. Through such partnerships, the Bank will support select States striving to bring about systemic improvements in the way development initiatives are planned and executed. He further said that in Kerala, we will work across cross-cutting themes and priority sectors to build systems of resilience. We are committed to supporting the State Government in bringing about a perceptible change in the lives and livelihoods of its citizens.

 

The Program aims to support the State with:

 

·       improved river basin planning and water infrastructure operations management, water supply and sanitation services

·       resilient and sustainable  agriculture, enhanced agriculture risk insurance

·       improved resilience of the core road network

·       unified and more up-to-date land records in high risk areas

·       risk-based urban planning and strengthened expenditure planning by urban local bodies

·       strengthened fiscal and public financial management capacity of the state

 

Mr. Balakrishna Menon, World Bank India Task Team Leader of the program said that the Bank support through this program will not only bring about additional financial resources but also help leverage other development partners and connect the State to lessons from global good practices.

 

The World Bank has been supporting the State through engagements such as the Second Kerala State Transport Project, Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project, National Hydrology Project, National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project Phase 2 and the Kerala Local Government and Service Delivery Project.

                The Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman said that the officers should use their academic knowledge to find innovative ideas for today’s India accounting for the diversities in human, geographical and local aspects.  She emphasized that economic models may not be limited to numbers but should incorporate the unpredictability of human behaviour. The Finance Minister, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman was addressing the Probationers and Officer-trainees of Indian Economic Service (IES) when they called on her in her Office in North Block in New Delhi today. The Minister encouraged the probationers to be not restricted to the micro terms of reference of their project at hand but keep a bird’s eye view to have a broad based outlook on the economy. She urged them to keep themselves updated with current domestic and global economic trends so that they can act as credible data source points for the Government at all levels of their careers.

   Earlier, a Group of 15 Officers from 2017 Batch and 12 Officer-trainees of 2018 Batch of the Indian Economic Service (IES) called on the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman and the Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur today at North Block in New Delhi. The Officers were accompanied by Chief Economic Adviser (CEA), Dr. Krishnamurthy V. Subramanian and Adviser, IES Cadre Sh. Arun Kumar Jha among others.

Earlier, addressing the probationers and Officer-trainees, the Minister of State for Finance, Shri Anurag Thakur said that the Group of young economists who have recently joined the Government would become a part of the in-house specialist cadre of economists. The IES carry out in-depth research and analysis, provide specialist inputs on various macro issues and sector specific diverse economic issues. He said that IES officers should provide fresh ideas and suggestions which can be of great use to the Government.

                Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) form an important component of the Indian Economy and contribute significantly to the country’s GDP, exports, industrial output, employment generation etc.  During the past few years, the said Sector has been facing constraints on several fronts.  In this regard, an MSME outreach initiative was launched by the Prime Minister on 2nd November, 2018 to provide access to credit, access to market, technology up-gradation, Ease of doing Business and a sense of security for employees of MSMEs.  Twelve announcements were made to address each of these 5 categories:

 

            In order to take the initiative further, it has been decided by the Government of India to continue to consolidate gains of the Outreach Campaign. In an Official Communication to the  Chairman, SBI and  MDs & CEOs of all Public Sector Banks (PSBs), it is therefore, requested that a CGM/GM level officer may be specifically designated to do an in-depth analysis of the progress made and issues in availability of credit, still being faced by the MSMEs.  While doing the analysis and corrective action thereof, the nodal GM may, inter alia, collect stepwise information on the following:- 

1)         Details of MSMEs who are taking credit from the bank

2)         Details of MSME accounts that are NPA

3)         Details of MSME accounts where restructuring/ resolution has been done as per RBI circular dated 1st January, 2019

4)         Details of new MSMEs covered during the campaign

5)         Details of MSMEs still uncovered 

A Proforma for submitting Weekly Reports to Department of Financial Services (DFS), Ministry of Finance is being sent separately to these PSBs. The campaign will be supervised by ED in-charge of MSME Financing. 

The Heads of all PSBs have been also asked that all sincere efforts should be made so that during the process of formalisation, the MSMEs may not suffer in want of credit which should be available to them as per the extant guidelines.

                The World Bank and the Government of India  signed here today a Loan Agreement of $400 Million to expand the coverage and the quality of interventions for the control of Tuberculosis (TB), which kills approximately half a million people in India every year. The World Bank supported program will cover nine States of India.    

The World Bank’s Program Towards Elimination of Tuberculosis will support the Government of India’s (GoI) National Strategic Plan to end TB in India by 2025.  It will do so by helping improve and strengthen diagnostics and management of drug-resistant tuberculosis and increase the capacity of public institutions engaged in monitoring and treating TB in the country.   

The World Bank and Govt. of India has over a two-decade long successful partnership in TB control.  The Bank’s support since 1998 has contributed to scaling up of Directly Observed Treatment and services to poor and high-risk groups, including tribal households, HIV patients, and children; universal access to diagnostics and quality TB care; and initiation of multi-drug resistant TB services.                               

“India’s Tuberculosis Control Program has substantive national and global public health and economic development implications,” said Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. “The Government of India’s National Strategic Plan is a transformative program and the World Bank support through the Program for Elimination of Tuberculosis will bring India closer to achieving the target of eliminating TB by 2025.”  

The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Government of India and Mr. Shanker Lal, Acting Country Director, on behalf of the World Bank. 

“TB predominantly affects the poor and marginalized and kills approximately 480,000 people every year in India. Through our support to this Program, the World Bank is fulfilling its partnership commitment to the country to invest in its human capital by supporting efforts to tackle infectious diseases having substantial health and economic impacts,” said Mr.  Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank. 

Drug resistant TB is a major public health threat and despite a growing number of TB cases being notified, India has more than a million “missing” cases every year with most of them being either undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed and treated in the private sector.  It is further exacerbated by delayed care-seeking by suspected TB patients, low adherence to treatment, and fragmented health care service providers, including an unregulated private sector which is treating more than half of TB cases in India. Such cases represent the greatest challenge facing TB control in India. 

            The Program seeks to ensure that these private sector providers adhere to established protocols of timely diagnosis, notification and effective management of TB.  The Program will provide financial incentives to private sector care providers for reporting cases of TB and ensuring that their patients complete the treatment regimen. It will also provide Direct Benefit Transfers to patients for acquiring the critical nutrition needed during treatment. The Program will help the GoI strengthen the monitoring and implementation of Nikshay - a web-based TB case monitoring system introduced by the government.   

The Program will also strengthen the detection, treatment and monitoring of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis and will track progress in detection of additional drug resistance.  It will also support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to develop and implement a human resource plan to meet institutional capacity needs at the Centre and State level, for the successful implementation of the NSP. 

 

            “The Program incorporates Indian and global best practices in private provider engagement for TB control, patient support interventions and capacity building. The Program is designed in close coordination with relevant development partners, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the WHO,” said Mr. Ronald Upenyu Mutasa, World Bank Task Team Leader for the Program.

 

The $ 400 Million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has a 19-year maturity which includes a 5-year grace period.

                The Government of India, Government of Rajasthan and the World Bank today signed a US$ 250 Million Loan Agreement for the Rajasthan State Highways Development Program II Project to build the State's capacity to better manage its highways and improve traffic flows on selected highways in State of Rajasthan. 

The World Bank-supported Project will support the construction, upgradation, improvement and maintenance of 766 kms of state highways and major district roads. It will also will help build an online project management system and a smartphone application to handle contract management, data reporting, quality control, etc. 

Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India said that development of State Highways in Rajasthan is crucial to the success of National-Level Connectivity Programs. The World Bank Project will not just help the State expand its road network but also have a lasting impact on the design and implementation of State-wide transport capital investments. 

The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare on behalf of the Government of India and Mr. Shanker Lal, Acting Country Director (India) on behalf of the World Bank. The Project Agreement was signed by Mr. M. L. Verma, Chief Engineer & Additional Secretary, Public Works Department on behalf of the Government of Rajasthan and Mr. Shanker Lal, Acting Country Director (India) on behalf of the World Bank. 

The Project will help build the capacity of the Public Works Department (PWD), which is responsible for about 70 percent of the State’s road network, as well as of the Rajasthan State Highways Authority. 

The Government of Rajasthan launched the Rajasthan State Highways Development Program in the financial year 2014-15 as a flagship program under its vision of a Resurgent Rajasthan. This ambitious plan aims to develop 20,000 kms of State Highways and major District roads through Public-Private Partnerships. 

The World Bank-supported project will help the state improve its competitiveness by increasing access to basic services for the population at large, especially those living in rural areas and smaller centers along the corridors. 

Road safety is a major component of the project, with more than 10,000 road traffic-related deaths reported in the state in 2017. A global information system-based database will enable recording and reporting of road accidents as well as the storage, analysis and dissemination of this information. Citizens will be empowered to report road accidents in rural areas through a simple-to-use smart phone application. 

Mr. Junaid Kamal Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank India said that the project has a significant focus on road safety - from helping build the state’s capacity for road safety management by using proactive and preventive methods, to using innovative tools to capture accident data, including from rural areas.  

Another important component includes gender audits for road designs and security enhancements for women and girls at bus stops, etc. The project will also help incorporate road designs to support the differently abled. 

Additional focus will be on making the roads resilient to climate change, particularly high temperatures and flooding, and also to develop institutional capacity for climate risk management. The project will support resource efficient growth through use of greener materials.  

Mesfin Wodajo Jijo and Ms Reenu Aneja, World Bank Task Team Leaders for the Project said that a crucial aspect of the Project is that it will support the operationalization of the Rajasthan State Highways Authority. The goal is to transform the management of the strategic road network through a State Highways Agency that will be accountable to the public for the services it delivers.  

The US$ 250 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has a 25-year maturity including a 5-year grace period.

                The Government of India, Government of Andhra Pradesh and the World Bank Executive signed here today a Loan Agreement of $328 Million to help improve the quality and responsiveness of public health services in Andhra Pradesh.  

The State of Andhra Pradesh has over the years demonstrated a strong commitment to improving health outcomes. In 2017-18, it allocated 5 percent of its total public expenditure towards health and has initiated significant steps towards strengthening its public health system.  

Maternal mortality ratio in the state declined by 52 percent and infant mortality fell to 35 per 1,000 live births from 54 over the decade from 2005. Ninety-three percent women now opt for institutional deliveries.  Despite these positive steps, there exist disparities within the state in coverage of maternal and child health services and quality of service delivery. Non-communicable diseases are also on the rise and form 60 percent of Andhra's burden of disease.  

The World Bank Loan will support the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) as it scales-up its efforts to bring better health care to all its citizens, especially pregnant women and those at risk of non-communicable diseases, like hypertension, diabetes and cervical cancer.   

The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; and Mr. Shanker[WU1]  Lal, Acting Country Director, World Bank on behalf of the World Bank. 

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance said that the Government of India's commitment to improve the country's health outcomes are fully mirrored in the State of Andhra Pradesh. This New Project will help leverage the State’s own systems and processes, and build capacity, thus enhancing the sustainability of the interventions.

 Public health institutions in the state will be strengthened through generation of quality information and its use in day-to-day management, and resource allocation process. Public feedback will be sought as a performance indicator for the State's Public Health Institutions.  

Earlier, Mr. Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank said that Andhra Pradesh has been fully committed to improving its health outcomes. The Project will support the state in adopting innovative and technologically-driven approaches to improve access and quality of health services. He further said that the Project will support certification of health centers when they achieve and maintain quality standards; engagement of private service providers for improved quality of care; improved pharmaceutical stock management system; integrated online patient management system; and empanelment of private pharmacies to dispense State-financed drugs to improve their access to the population. It will also support the rollout of a system for measuring and reporting on patient experience.  

Ms Mohini Kak, World Bank Task Team Leader for the Project said that today, a primary health care facility exists for every 5,721 population on average in Andhra Pradesh and a secondary/tertiary care facility exists for every 200,000 population in the state. A continued focus on quality of care and availability of services will ensure quality health services to all, especially the poor.  

The $328 Million Loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has a 23.5-year maturity which includes a 6-year grace period.

Under the ambit of UNODC, Paris Pact Initiative has addressed the issue of drug problem related to opiates originating in Afghanistan, both at policy and implementation level. It has provided the platform for the Member Countries and International Organizations to coordinate and combat the trafficking and consumption of opiates on the principle of common and shared responsibility.

The experts from other countries and International Organisations will share their experiences during this Expert Working Group Meeting. This will provide an opportunity for Indian Agencies to understand the updates on current threats posed by illicit financial flows which may include new methods to assess such threats and activities. The Meeting will also highlight upon the technical assistance needs and new capabilities to enhance understanding and disruption of illicit financial flows. This will lead to improving the effectiveness of India’s AML/CFT framework as per FATF standards with respect to illicit financial flows linked to drug trafficking.

                Over the last four Financial Years, the Government of India has taken comprehensive steps to strengthen the Public Sector Banks (PSBs), under Government’s 4R’s strategy of recognising NPAs transparently, resolving and recovering value from Stressed Accounts through clean and effective laws and processes, recapitalising banks, and reforming banks through the PSB Reforms Agenda. 

 

Under recapitalisation, over the last three Financial Years, PSBs have been recapitalised to the extent of Rs. 2.87 lakh crore, with infusion of Rs. 2.20 lakh crore by the Government and mobilisation of over Rs. 0.66 lakh crore by PSBs themselves. Details of capital infused in PSBs by the Government are at Annex. Besides recapitalisation, other steps taken by the Government to improve the condition of banks, include, inter alia, the following:

 


	Change in credit culture with institution of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) fundamentally changing the creditor-borrower relationship, taking away control of the defaulting company from promoters/owners and debarring wilful defaulters from the resolution process and debarring them from raising funds from the market. 
	Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 has been enacted to enable confiscation of fugitive economic offenders’ property. 
	Heads of PSBs have been empowered to request for issuance of look-out circulars.
	National Financial Reporting Authority has been established as an independent regulator for enforcing auditing standards and ensuring audit quality. 
	Key reforms have been instituted in PSBs, including the following: 


 


	To ensure proper due diligence in project financing, Board-approved Loan Policies of PSBs now mandate tying up necessary clearances/approvals and linkages before disbursement, scrutiny of group balance-sheet and ring-fencing of cash flows, and appraised of non-fund and tail risk.
	For mitigating risk on account of misrepresentation and fraud, use of third-party data sources for comprehensive due diligence across data sources has been instituted.
	For clean and effective monitoring, monitoring roles have been strictly segregated from sanctioning roles in high-value loans, and specialised monitoring agencies combining financial and domain knowledge have been deployed for effective monitoring of loans above Rs. 250 crore.
	To ensure timely and better realisation in One-Time Settlements (OTSs), online end-to-end OTS platforms have been set up.
	For faster processing of loan proposals, Loan Management Systems have been put in place for personal segment and MSME loans.


 


	To strengthen governance at the Board level, the position of Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) has been bifurcated into separate positions of a Non-executive Chairman and a Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 
	A professional Banks Board Bureau (BBB) has been created for arm’s length selection of non-executive Chairmen and whole-time directors.


 

            Positive impact on PSBs of Government’s 4R’s approach is now visible and is reflected, inter-alia¸ in the following:

 


	Robust recovery of Rs. 3.59 lakh crore has been effected over the last four years, including record recovery of Rs 1.23 lakh crore in financial year (FY) 2018-19.
	Asset quality has greatly improved, which is reflected in 45% year-on-year reduction in slippage into non-performing assets (NPAs) in FY 2018-19, and 63% reduction in 31 to 90 days overdue corporate accounts by March 2019 from their peak level in June 2017. 
	With stress recognition largely completed, significant headway in recovery and resolution under IBC, and reduced slippages as a result of improved underwriting and monitoring, gross NPAs of PSBs have started declining, after peaking in March 2018, registering a decline of Rs. 89,189 crore from Rs. 8.96 lakh crore in March 2018 to Rs 8.06 lakh crore in March 2019.
	With substantial cleaning up accompanied by recapitalisation of banks, credit growth of PSBs has picked up substantially, from 0.78% year-on-year in FY 2016-17 to 7.51% in FY 2018-19.


By addressing the underlying causes behind the build-up of stress in PSBs through comprehensive reform to change credit culture and tighten discipline for stakeholders across the financial system, institutionalisation of robust underwriting and monitoring, fundamental governance reforms, and leveraging of the transformation potential of technology, the risk of recurrence of excessive stress in PSBs has been considerably minimised and PSBs have emerged stronger.

Note: In the reply, the figures for PSBs include those for IDBI Bank Limited, which has been recategorised by RBI as a private sector bank with effect from 21.1.2019.

                In terms of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Guidelines on Priority Sector Lending (PSL), a target of 40 percent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, as of preceding March 31st, has been mandated for lending to the priority sector by domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks and Foreign Banks with 20 branches and above. Within this, sub-targets of 10 and 18 percent of ANBC or Credit Equivalent amount of OBE, whichever is higher, as of preceding March 31st, have been mandated for lending to weaker sections and  Agriculture respectively. Further, within   the   18   percent   target   for agriculture, a sub-target of 8 percent of ANBC or OBE, whichever is higher has been prescribed for Small and Marginal Farmers. 

As per RBI’s notification dated 19.06.2018 loans to individuals up to Rs. 28 lakh in metropolitan centre and Rs. 20 lakh in other centres, are eligible to be classified under priority sector, provided that the cost of dwelling unit does not exceed Rs. 35 lakh and Rs. 25 lakh, respectively. To give a fillip to low-cost housing for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Low Income Groups (LIG), the housing loan limits for eligibility under priority sector lending have been revised to Rs. 35 lakh in metropolitan centres, and Rs. 25 lakh in other centres with certain conditions. Further, there is provision of loan for construction of house for EWS and LIG wherein the total cost of house does not exceed Rs 10 lakh provided the family income limit is Rs.2 lakh per annum. This income criteria has been revised to Rs. 3 lakh per annum for EWS and Rs. 6 lakh per annum for LIG.

The Government of India extends bank loans to Economically Weaker Section (EWS) under various schemes. Some of the schemes of Government for EWS are as under: 


	In pursuance of the Government vision of facilitating housing to all by 2022 Government has launched Pradhan MantriAwasYojana – Urban (PMAY-U) mission on 25.06.2015. The mission aims to provide assistance to all States/UTs in addressing the housing requirement of urban poor including EWS/ LIG.
	Under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) for EWS/ LIG component of PMAY-U an interest subsidy of 6.5% for EWS / LIG, calculated on Housing Loan up to Rs. 6 lakh over a tenure of 20 years is provided by the Government. 



	III. All Scheduled Commercial Banks have adopted and implemented the IBA Model Educational Loan Scheme for pursuing higher education in India and abroad. The scheme is applicable uniformly to all students’ borrowers including students belonging to weaker sections. However, for the students belonging to EWS whose parental/family income is upto Rs 4.50 Lakh, an Interest Subsidy Scheme, namely Central Sector Interest Subsidy Scheme (CSIS), is operational under which full interest subsidy, on educational loans upto Rs 7.50 lakh, is available during the period of moratorium on loans availed under the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) Model Education Loan Scheme from Scheduled Banks. CSIS scheme benefits all categories of economically weaker students for pursuing professional/ technical courses in lndia and intends to provide affordable higher education.

                Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued directions for Relief Measures to be provided by respective lending institutions in areas affected by natural calamities which, inter alia, include, restructuring/rescheduling of existing crop loans and term loans, extending fresh loans, relaxed security and margin norms, moratorium, etc. These directions have been so designed that the moment calamity is declared by the concerned District Authorities, they are automatically set in motion without any intervention, thus saving precious time. The benchmark for initiating relief measures by banks has also been reduced from 50% to 33% crop loss in line with the National Disaster Management Framework. Banks have also been advised not to insist for additional collateral security for restructured loans.

With a view to ensuring availability of agriculture credit at a reduced interest rate, the Government of India in the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare (DAC&FW) implements an interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh, which provides interest subvention of 2% per annum to Banks on use of their own resources, and,  an additional 3% incentive to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%. Under the aforesaid interest subvention scheme, to provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, the interest subvention (2%) on crop loan continues to be available to banks for the first year on the restructured amount. Such restructured loans may however, attract normal rate of interest from the second year onwards as per policy laid down by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 

In order to provide relief to the farmers affected due to severe natural calamities, the Government in DAC&FW has decided that interest subvention of 2% per annum will be made available to banks for first three years/entire period (subject to a maximum of five years) on the restructured loan amount, and in all such cases the benefit of prompt repayment incentive at 3% per annum shall also be provided to the affected farmers. The grant of such benefits in cases of severe natural calamities shall, however, be decided by a High Level Committee (HLC) based on the recommendation of Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) and Sub Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC).

State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Uttar Pradesh has reported that there was no natural calamity in the State of Uttar Pradesh during Financial Year 2018-19 and therefore no State Government notification was issued in this regard. 

The Government of India/ RBI/ National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) have, inter alia, taken the following major initiatives for providing hassle free crop loans to farmers :-


	Government fixes agriculture credit disbursement targets for the banking sector every year and banks have consistently surpassed these targets.
	As per RBI directions, Domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks are required to lend 18% of the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent to Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (CEOBE), whichever is higher, towards agriculture. 
	The Government has introduced the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, which enables farmers to purchase agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, etc. and draw cash to satisfy their agricultural and consumption needs. The KCC Scheme has since been simplified and converted into ATM enabled RuPay debit card with, inter alia, facilities of one-time documentation, built-in cost escalation in the limit, any number of drawals within the limit, etc.
	To enhance coverage of small and marginal farmers in the formal credit system, RBI has decided to raise the limit for collateral-free agriculture loans from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 1.6 lakh.
	The requirement of 'no due’ certificate has also been dispensed with for small loans up to Rs.50,000 to small and marginal farmers, share-croppers and the like and, instead, only a self-declaration from the borrower is required.
	To bring small, marginal, tenant farmers, oral lessees, etc. into the fold of institutional credit, Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have been promoted by banks.

            Individual Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have their own helpline/toll free numbers. Most of these banks are providing accounts related information, including the nature of accounts through this facility. Besides, the type of account is also printed on the passbook provided by some banks to their customers. The customer can also view the details of the account using Internet Banking Facility. 

 

The Government, as such, does not maintain any helpline number or any other source to inform customers of individual banks about their account details.

There are 28 individuals who are accused in criminal cases being investigated by ED and who are either residing abroad or who have left the country before initiation of investigations by ED. Since these cases are at various stages of investigations by ED, it will not be in larger public interest to disclose names of such persons, amount involved and status of investigation as the same may adversely affect these investigations.


            Necessary action has been initiated for bringing these persons back to India. In this regard, Red Corner Notice (RCN) have been issued against 25 persons; Extradition requests have been issued for 14 persons; action under Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 (FEOA) have been initiated against 07 persons and 03 persons accused under PMLA have been brought back to India.


            There are adequate legal and administrative measures in place to tackle economic offenders who have either fled from the country or are likely to flee during the course of investigations. Whenever there is apprehension that the accused person may leave the country during the pendency of PMLA investigation, Look Out Circular (LoC) is issued by the Directorate of Enforcement. In case any of the accused person against whom LoC is issued tries to leave the country the Immigration Authority informs the Directorate and such person is apprehended. Further, some of the accused persons may already be residing abroad or may have left India before the commencement of the investigation under PMLA. In such cases action is taken by issuance of RCN and Extradition Request. Action under the newly enacted FEOA, 2018 is also initiated in suitable cases against economic offenders who have left India so as to avoid criminal prosecution or who, being abroad, refuse to return to India to face criminal prosecution and the total amount involved in the economic offence is more than Rs. 100 crore.

                There is no proposal under consideration of the Union Government to waive-off loans of farmers. 

However, to reduce the Debt Burden of farmers, the following major initiatives have been taken:


	With a view to ensure availability of agriculture credit at a reduced interest rate of 7% p.a. to the farmers, the Government of India in the Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare (DAC&FW) implements an Interest Subvention Scheme for short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh. The Scheme provides interest subvention of 2% per annum to Banks on use of their own resources.  Besides, additional 3% incentive is given to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.
	Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued directions for Relief Measures to be provided by respective lending institutions in areas affected by natural calamities which, inter alia, include, restructuring/rescheduling of existing crop loans and term loans, extending fresh loans, relaxed security and margin norms, moratorium, etc. These directions have been so designed that the moment calamity is declared by the concerned District Authorities, they are automatically set in motion without any intervention, thus saving precious time. The benchmark for initiating relief measures by banks has also been reduced from 50% to 33% crop loss in line with the National Disaster Management Framework. Banks have also been advised not to insist for additional collateral security for restructured loans.
	To enhance coverage of small and marginal farmers in the formal credit system, RBI has decided to raise the limit for collateral-free agriculture loans from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 1.6 lakh.
	The requirement of ‘no due’ certificate has also been dispensed with for small loans upto Rs.50,000/- to small and marginal farmers, share croppers and the like and, instead, only a self-declaration from the borrower is required.
	To bring small, marginal, tenant farmers, oral lessees, etc. into the fold of institutional credit, Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have been promoted by banks.
	Pradhan MantriKIsanSAmmanNidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme has been implemented to provide an assured income support to all farmers, irrespective of the size of their land holdings subject to the exclusion factor. Under this scheme direct income support @ of Rs. 6,000 per year will be transferred directly into the bank accounts of beneficiary farmers, in three equal instalments of Rs.2,000 each. 



	Pradhan MantriFasalBimaYojana (PMFBY) provides a comprehensive insurance cover against failure of insured crops due to non-preventable natural risks, thus providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/ damage arising out of unforeseen events; stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming; and encouraging them to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices. 



	For development of agriculture and welfare of farmers of the country, the Government in DAC&FW, is implementing various Central Sector/ Centrally Sponsored Schemes, which include:



	RashtriyaKrishiVikasYojana (RKVY) 
	 National Food Security Mission (NFSM)


(iii) National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) 

(iv) National Mission For Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)

The Tax Collection in April, 2019 has been the highest ever in a particular month i.e. Rs. 1,13,865 crore since GST implementation. It is usually noticed that there will be a jump in the tax collection in the last month of Financial Year as tax payers try to pay arrears of some of the previous months and, therefore, this month’s revenue cannot be taken as trend for the future. Although, the GST collections for May, 2019 have been Rs. 1,00,289 crore, GST collection has shown a consistent growth trend over the last two years. The month-on-month growth in GST collection has been 10.1% and 6.7% for April and May respectively.

 

 The number of Returns filed till due date (20th of the next month) for the month of May, 2019 was 65,18,408 (63.37%) as compared to 60,61,978 (59.24%) for the month of April, 2019

                As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data on global operations (provisional data for the financial year ending March 2019), Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have declined by Rs. 89,189 crore from the peak of Rs. 8,95,601 crore in March 2018 to Rs. 8,06,412 crore in March 2019 (provisional data).

As per RBI data on global operations, aggregate gross advances of PSBs increased from       Rs. 18,19,074 crore as on 31.3.2008 to Rs. 52,15,920 crore as on 31.3.2014. As per RBI inputs, the primary reasons for spurt in Stressed Assets have been observed to be, inter-alia, aggressive lending practices, wilful default/loan frauds/corruption in some cases, and economic slowdown. Asset Quality Review (AQR) initiated in 2015 for clean and fully provisioned bank balance-sheets revealed high incidence of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). As a result of AQR and subsequent transparent recognition by banks, stressed accounts were reclassified as NPAs and expected losses on stressed loans, not provided for earlier under flexibility given to restructured loans, were provided for. Further, all such schemes for restructuring stressed loans were withdrawn.

The Government adopted the comprehensive 4R’s strategy consisting of recognition of NPAs transparently, resolution and recovering value from stressed accounts, recapitalising Public Sector Banks (PSBs), and reforms in PSBs and financial ecosystem to ensure a responsible and clean system. Steps taken under these strategies to expedite and enable resolution of NPAs of PSBs, and to improve the condition of banks include, inter-alia, the following:


	Change in credit culture was effected, with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) fundamentally changing the creditor-borrower relationship, taking away control of the defaulting company from promoters/owners and debarring wilful defaulters from the resolution process and debarring them from raising funds from the market.
	Over the last four financial years, PSBs were recapitalised to the extent of Rs. 3.12 lakh crore, with infusion of Rs. 2.46 lakh crore by the Government and mobilisation of over Rs. 0.66 lakh crore by PSBs themselves. 
	Key reforms were instituted in PSBs as part of PSBs Reforms Agenda, include the following: 



	Board-approved Loan Policies of PSBs now mandate tying up necessary clearances/approvals and linkages before disbursement, scrutiny of group balance-sheet and ring-fencing of cash flows, non-fund and tail risk appraisal in project financing.
	Use of third-party data sources for comprehensive due diligence across data sources has been instituted, thus mitigating risk on account of misrepresentation and fraud.
	Monitoring has been strictly segregated from sanctioning roles in high-value loans, and specialised monitoring agencies combining financial and domain knowledge have been deployed for effective monitoring of loans above Rs. 250 crore.
	To ensure timely and better realisation in One-Time Settlements (OTSs), online end-to-end OTS platforms have been set up.


            Positive impact on PSBs of Government’s 4R’s approach is now visible and includes, inter-alia¸ the following:


	Robust recovery of Rs. 3.59 lakh crores over the last four years, including record recovery of Rs 1.23 lakh crores in FY 2018-19, has been effected.
	Assets quality has improved as reflected in 45% year-on-year reduction in slippage into NPAs in FY 2018-19, and 63% reduction in 31 to 90 days overdue corporate accounts by March 2019 from their peak in June 2017. 
	With stress recognition largely completed, significant headway in recovery and resolution under IBC, and reduced slippages as a result of improved underwriting and monitoring, gross NPAs of PSBs have started declining, after peaking in March 2018, registering a decline of Rs. 89,189 crore, from Rs. 8.96 lakh crore in March 2018 to     Rs. 8.06 lakh crore in March 2019.


By addressing the underlying causes behind the build-up of stress in PSBs through comprehensive reform to change credit culture and tighten discipline for every stakeholder in the financial system, institutionalising robust underwriting and monitoring, governance reforms, and leverage the transformation potential of technology, the risk of recurrence of excessive stress in PSBs has been minimised and PSBs have emerged stronger.

As per inputs received from RBI, the share of lending by PSBs and Private Sector Banks to real estate sector as a percentage of total lending has increased from 16.77% in 2013 to 17.57% in 2016. Further, their total advances to the real estate sector rose from   Rs. 8,55,695 crore in 2013 to Rs. 12,11,889 crore in 2016.

Note: Figures cited above for PSBs include those for IDBI Bank Limited, which was re-categorised as A Private Sector Bank by RBI with effect from 21.1.2019.

This was stated by the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply to a Parliament Question in Rajya Sabha today.

                As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data on global operations, aggregate gross advances of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) increased from Rs. 18,19,074 crore as on 31.3.2008 to Rs. 52,15,920 crore as on 31.3.2014. As per RBI inputs, the primary reasons for spurt in stressed assets have been observed to be, inter-alia, aggressive lending practices, wilful default / loan frauds / corruption in some cases, and economic slowdown. Asset Quality Review (AQR) initiated in 2015 for clean and fully provisioned bank balance-sheets revealed high incidence of NPAs. As a result of AQR and subsequent transparent recognition by banks, stressed accounts were reclassified as NPAs and expected losses on stressed loans, not provided for earlier under flexibility given to restructured loans, were provided for. Further, all such schemes for restructuring stressed loans were withdrawn. Primarily as a result of transparent recognition of stressed assets as NPAs, gross NPAs of PSBs, as per RBI data on global operations, rose from Rs. 2,79,016 crore as on 31.3.2015, to Rs. 8,95,601 crore as on 31.3.2018, and as a result of Government’s 4R’s strategy of recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms, have since declined by Rs. 89,189 crore to Rs. 8,06,412 crore as on 31.3.2019 (provisional data).
Data on NPAs is regularly published by RBI as part of its Financial Stability Reports. NPA data is not collated by RBI in terms of corporate houses / companies. PSB-wise details of gross NPA (GNPA) for Industry category advances in domestic operations and total GNPA in global operations, as per RBI data, are at Annex.


            As per RBI provisional data on global operations, as on 31.3.2019, the aggregate amount of gross NPAs of PSBs and Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) were Rs. 8,06,412 crore and Rs. 9,49,279 crore respectively.


            Over the last four years, Government has taken comprehensive steps under its 4R’s strategy of recognising NPAs transparently, resolving and recovering value from stressed accounts, recapitalising PSBs, and reforms in banks and financial ecosystem to ensure a responsible and clean system.
Steps taken to expedite and enable resolution of NPAs of PSBs, include, inter-alia, the following:


(1) The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) has been enacted, which has provided for the taking over management of the affairs of the corporate debtor at the outset of the corporate insolvency resolution process. Coupled with debarment of wilful defaulters and persons associated with NPA accounts from the resolution process, this has effected a fundamental change in the creditor-debtor relationship. Further, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 has been amended to provide for authorisation to RBI to issue directions to banks to initiate the insolvency resolution process under IBC. As per RBI’s directions under the aforesaid amended provision in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, banks have been filed cases under IBC before the National Company Law Tribunal in respect of RBI-specified borrowers.


(2) Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act has been amended to make it more effective, with provision for three months’ imprisonment in case the borrower does not provide asset details and for the lender to get possession of mortgaged property within 30 days. Also, six new Debts Recovery Tribunals have been established to expedite recovery.
(3) Under the PSB Reforms Agenda, PSBs have created Stressed Asset Management Verticals to focus attention on recovery, segregated monitoring from sanctioning roles in high-value loans, and entrusted monitoring of loan accounts of above Rs. 250 crore to specialised monitoring agencies for clean and effective monitoring, and created online end-to-end One-Time Settlement platforms for timely and better realisation.


            Enabled by the above steps, as per RBI data on global operations (provisional data for the financial year ending March 2019), gross NPAs of PSBs have declined from the peak of Rs. 8,95,601 crore in March 2018 to Rs. 8,06,412 crore in March 2019 (provisional data). PSBs have recovered Rs. 3,59,496 crore over the last four financial years, including record recovery of Rs. 1,23,156 crore during 2018-19.

Note: Figures cited above for PSBs include those for IDBI Bank Limited, which was recategorised as a private sector bank by RBI with effect from 21.1.2019.

This was stated by the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

The Government of India has set- up a Project Monitoring-Invest India Cell (PMIC), earlier known as Project Monitoring Group, for resolving of issues and fast tracking the setting-up and expeditious commissioning of large Public, Private and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Projects. However, there is no prescribed criterion for classifying a project as a Stalled Project. The primary focus of PMIC is on expediting the approvals for clearances from Central and State Authorities for setting-up of projects. PMIC does not distinguish between a ‘stalled’ or an ‘under implementation’ Project in accepting a project for resolution of its issues.
            PMIC has been monitoring the resolution of a variety of issues brought before it by the Central Ministries/State Governments and project proponents. So far, out of 1,038 projects considered by PMIC, issues in 615 projects (anticipated investments Rs.~22,34,805 Cr) have been resolved and issue of 125 projects (anticipated investment Rs.~8,19,780 Cr) required no further action/intervention from PMIC. Out of these 740 Projects, 340 Projects have been partly/fully commissioned with actual flow of investments amounting to Rs.11.66 lakh crore (approx.) till 08.02.2019, while 238 projects worth Rs.8.5 lakh crore are in the pipeline. As on 12.06.2019, 298 projects (anticipated investment ~10,98,710 Cr.) are under consideration of PMIC.
            The Projects considered by PMIC mainly pertains to the following sectors, as detailed in the Statement attached as Annexure ‘A’: -
(i) National Highways and Railways (iv) Chemicals and Fertilizers

(ii) Civil Aviation and Shipping (v) Coal, Power and Mines

(iii) Petroleum and Natural Gas (vi) Cement, Construction and Steel

            A Statement indicating details of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in the last three years is at Annexure ‘B’, which shows an increasing trend of investment.
            A Statement indicating details of projects in which issues reported to PMIC have been resolved in key infrastructure sectors and those which are still under consideration of PMIC is at Annexure ‘A’. 

This was stated by the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                The Government of India fixes Agriculture Credit Disbursement Targets for the Banking Sector every year and banks have consistently surpassed these targets.

          State-wise details of Agriculture Credit Target fixed by the Government for the year 2019-20 is at Annexure I.

          State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Maharashtra has reported that they are extending credit facilities, through various schemes & products for agriculture lending to all eligible farmers across the country including farmers of Buldhana Parliamentary Constituency of Maharashtra.

          District-wise details of crop loan disbursements as on 15.06.2019 for the State of Maharashtra as reported by SLBC, Maharashtra is given at Annexure II.

          The Government of India/ Reserve Bank of India (RBI)/ NABARD have, inter alia, taken the following major initiatives for providing hassle free crop loans to farmers of the country:-


	With a view to ensure availability of agriculture credit at a reduced interest rate of 7% p.a. to the farmers, the Government of India in the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare implements an interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh. The scheme provides interest subvention of 2% per annum to Banks on use of their own resources. Besides, additional 3% incentive is given to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to4%.


 


	As per RBI directions, Domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks are required to lend 18% of the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent to Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (CEOBE), whichever is higher, towards agriculture. A sub-target of 8% is also prescribed for lending to small and marginal farmers including landless agricultural labourers, tenant farmers, oral lessees and share croppers. Similarly, in the case of Regional Rural Banks 18% of their total outstanding advances is required to be towards agriculture and a sub-target of 8% has been set for lending to small and marginalfarmers.


 


	The Government has introduced the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, which enables farmers to purchase agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, etc. and draw cash to satisfy their agricultural and consumption needs. The KCC Scheme has since been simplified and converted into ATM enabled RuPayDebit Card with, inter alia, facilities of one-time documentation, built-in cost escalation in the limit, any number of drawals within the limit,etc.


 

· Under the KCC Scheme, a flexible limit of Rs.10,000 to Rs.50,000 has been provided to marginal farmers (as Flexi KCC) based on the land holding and crops grown including post-harvest warehouse storage related credit needs and other farm expenses, consumption needs, etc., plus small term loan investments without relating it to the value ofland.

 


	To enhance coverage of small and marginal farmers in the formal credit system, RBI has decided to raise the limit for collateral-free agriculture loans from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 1.6lakh.


 


	The requirement of 'no due’ certificate has also been dispensed with for small loans up to Rs.50,000 to small and marginal farmers, share-croppers and the like and, instead, only a self-declaration from the borrower is required.


 


	To bring small, marginal, tenant farmers, oral lessees, etc. into the fold of institutional credit, Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have been promoted bybanks.

                There is a marked increase in the number of income tax filed through e-filing. The number of e-Returns submitted for Assessment Year 2018-19 is 6,49,39,586 as against 5,47,30,304 e-Returns filed for the Assessment Year 2017-18, thereby marking a remarkable increase of 18.65% over previous Assessment Year. A total of 7.19 crore Income Tax Returns (ITRs) have been processed in the Financial Year 2018-19. The total amount of refund released in Financial Year 2018-19 is Rs. 1,61,457.6 Crore.

The Government has accorded high priority to issue refunds for all taxpayers including small taxpayers. Less than 0.5% of ITRs are selected for scrutiny, the majority of ITRs are processed expeditiously and refunds are issued. With greater adoption of information technology in processing of ITRs and emphasis on less intrusive verification, the time taken to process ITRs is constantly reducing. Refunds amounting to Rs. 64,700 crores have already been issued in this Financial Year till 18.06. 2019.The Government has made it mandatory from March, 2019 to issue income-tax refunds through ECS only, therefore, expediting direct credit of refunds to bank accounts. Further, all field authorities have been instructed to issue refunds up to Rs 5,000 without any adjustment against outstanding demand, if any.

The Government has initiated several measures to educate the tax payers to e-file their ITRs. Outreach measures, including training in e-filing, conducting workshops and awareness programmes, are being undertaken by the Income Tax Department. Aayakar Seva Kendras (ASKs) have been established in all regional offices to address tax payers’ concerns and guide them in e-filing their ITRs. The official website of the Income Tax Department offers step by step guidance on how to e-file the ITRs. The Government is also utilizing print media, audio and visual media as well as social media to educate people to file their ITRs through e-filing. Regular advertisements are placed in Newspapers and News Portals in internet each year during peak e-filing periods to educate and encourage taxpayers to submit their ITRs online. A total of 26.9 crore SMS and e-mails were sent to taxpayers in Financial Year 2018-19 reminding them for timely submission of ITRs and other important requirements.

Recently, in January, 2019, the Government has approved Integrated E-filing & Centralized Processing Centre (CPC) 2.0 Project of the Income Tax Department. The details of the CPC 2.0 Project are:


	
	CPC 2.0 Project envisages pre-filling of ITRs by the Income-tax Department and its acceptance by the taxpayer so as to improve accuracy of information contained in the Return and drastically reduce the existing turnaround time taken in processing of Returns and issuance of refunds.
	
	CPC 2.0 Project will process ITRs in a consistent, uniform, rule driven, identity blind manner. This would ensure fairness in tax treatment to all taxpayers irrespective of their status.
	
	(iii) The CPC 2.0 Project would significantly improve transparency and accountability of Income-tax Department as processing of returns and issuance of refunds would take place without any interface with the Department.
	
	CPC 2.0 Project would adhere to international best practices and standards. It would keep the taxpayer informed by providing processing status update, speedy communication using mobile app, email, SMS and through website of the Income-tax Department.
	
	CPC 2.0 Project envisages setting up of integrated contact centres for taxpayer’s assistance and undertaking outreach programs involving taxpayers and other stakeholders through digital media in an effective manner.



Thus, CPC 2.0 Project besides promoting the Government objective of promoting voluntary tax-compliance culture would also smoothen the process of e-filing and processing of ITRs and will also bring about a significant enhancement in services to the taxpayers.

 

This was stated by the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                             To strengthen the Public Sector Banks (PSBs), over the last four financial years, the Government of India has taken comprehensive steps under its 4R’s strategy of recognising NPAs transparently, resolving and recovering value from stressed accounts through clean and effective laws and processes, re-capitalising banks, and reforming banks through the PSB Reforms Agenda.

Over the last five Financial Years (FYs), PSBs have been recapitalised to the extent of Rs. 3.19 lakh crore, with infusion of Rs. 2.5 lakh crore by the Government and mobilisation of over Rs. 66,000 crore by PSBs themselves. 

Details of capital infused in PSBs by the Government are at Annex.


Other steps taken by the Government to improve the condition of banks, include, inter alia, the following:


	
	Change in credit culture with institution of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) fundamentally changing the creditor-borrower relationship, taking away control of the defaulting company from promoters/owners and debarring wilful defaulters from the resolution process and debarring them from raising funds from the market.
	
	Fugitive Economic Offenders Act has been enacted enabling confiscation of fugitive economic offenders’ property.
	
	PSBs heads have been empowered to request for issuance of look-out circulars.
	
	National Financial Reporting Authority has been established as an independent Regulator for enforcing auditing standards and ensuring audit quality. 
	
	Key reforms have been instituted in PSBs, including the following: 



	
	Board-approved Loan Policies of PSBs now mandate tying up necessary clearances/approvals and linkages before disbursement, scrutiny of group balance-sheet and ring-fencing of cash flows, non-fund and tail risk appraisal in project financing.
	
	Use of third-party data sources for comprehensive due diligence across data sources has been instituted, thus mitigating risk on account of misrepresentation and fraud.
	
	Monitoring has been strictly segregated from sanctioning roles in high-value loans, and specialised monitoring agencies combining financial and domain knowledge have been deployed for effective monitoring of loans above Rs. 250 crore.
	
	To ensure timely and better realisation in one-time settlements (OTSs), online end-to-end OTS platforms have been set-up.
	
	For faster processing of loan proposals, Loan Management Systems (LMS) have been put in place for personal segment and MSME loans.



	
	To strengthen governance at the Board level, the position of Chairman and Managing Director has been bifurcated into a non-executive Chairman and an MD & CEO.
	
	A professional Banks Board Bureau has been created for arm’s length selection of non-executive Chairmen and whole-time directors (WTDs).



Positive impact on PSBs of Government’s 4R’s approach is now visible and includes, inter-alia¸ the following:


	
	Robust recovery of Rs. 3.59 lakh crores over the last four years, including record recovery of Rs 1.23 lakh crores in FY 2018-19, has been effected.
	
	Assets quality has improved as reflected in 45% year-on-year reduction in slippage into NPAs in FY 2018-19, and 63% reduction in 31 to 90 days overdue (SMA-1 & 2) corporate accounts by March 2019 from their peak in June 2017.
	
	With stress recognition largely completed, significant headway in recovery and resolution under IBC, and reduced slippages as a result of improved underwriting and monitoring, gross NPAs of PSBs have started declining, after peaking in March 2018, registering a decline of Rs. 89,189 crore, from Rs. 8.96 lakh crore in March 2018 to Rs 8.06 lakh crore in March 2019.
	
	With substantial cleaning up accompanied by capitalisation of banks, the overall credit growth of PSBs has picked up substantially, from 0.78 % in FY 2016-17 to 7.51% in FY 2018-19.



By addressing the underlying causes behind the build-up of stress in PSBs through comprehensive reform to change credit culture and tighten discipline for every stakeholder in the financial system, institutionalising robust underwriting and monitoring, governance reforms, and leveraging the transformation potential of technology, the risk of recurrence of excessive stress in PSBs has been minimised and PSBs have emerged stronger.
Note: In the reply, the figures for PSBs include those for IDBI Bank Limited, which has been re-categorised by RBI as a private sector bank with effect from 21.1.2019.

                The Government of India, the Government of Jharkhand and the World Bank, signed here today a $147 Million Loan Agreement to provide basic urban services to the people of Jharkhand and help improve the management capacity of the urban local bodies (ULBs) in the State.

The Jharkhand Municipal Development Project will focus on improving the municipal sector’s capacity to provide basic urban services. It will invest in urban services such as water supply, sewerage, drainage, and urban roads; and strengthen the capacity of the Jharkhand Urban Infrastructure Development Company (JUIDCO) as well as that of the ULBs to carry out reforms in the areas of urban finance and governance. 

This is in keeping with the needs of a rapidly urbanizing state where about 31 million people reside in urban areas and urban population growth in nine of 24 districts in Jharkhand is above India’s overall urbanization pace of 2.7 percent. 

 Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, said that the Government of India recognizes that urbanization and economic growth are interlinked and initiated a comprehensive road map for municipal reforms through the AMRUT program. He further said that the Jharkhand Municipal Reform Program will be a definite step forward to strengthen and improve urban services in a fast urbanizing state and will provide an impetus to economic growth.  

The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India and Mr. Shanker Lal, Acting Country Director (India),           the World Bank, on behalf of the World Bank. Whereas, the Project Agreement was signed by Mr. Ameet Kumar, Director, State Urban Development Agency (SUDA), Urban Development & Housing Department on behalf of the Government of Jharkhand, Mr. Utkarsh Mishra, Deputy Project Director (EAP) on behalf of Jharkhand Urban Infrastructure Development Company on behalf of  and Mr. Shanker Lal, Acting Country Director (India), the World Bank, on behalf of the World Bank. 

Mr. Shanker Lal, Acting Country Director (India) ssid that Over the past decade, Jharkhand has been focusing on bringing ULBs to the forefront of development and delivery of municipal services. However, there is a huge unfinished reforms and investment agenda for the State. He further said thjat in this broader context, this project will support the process of strengthening the capacity of urban local bodies while investing in municipal services.  

Most of these components will be open to all 43 ULBs in the state who may wish to participate within an agreed framework under the project. Over 350,000 urban residents of the participating ULBs are expected to benefit, of which at least 45 percent will be women.  

Interventions such as piped water supply, storm water drains, climate friendly road construction and energy efficient street lighting will not only help improve urban services but also make it environmentally sustainable.  

Work on two sub-projects – Khunti water supply subproject and the Dhanbad roads subproject is expected to commence shortly. Through its other key components, the project will improve urban governance by assisting ULBs to improve their organizational capacity, manage finances in a sustainable manner, and focus on the development of its nodal implementing agency, JUIDCO.    

Vasudha Thawakar , Senior Urban Development Specialist and Task Team Leader for the Project said that Jharkhand needs large-scale investments in urban infrastructure and services. Such investments will require a phased approach. This Project will focus on closing the gap on access to basic services and at the same time build the capacity of its institutions to better manage and provide services effectively.  

The Loan, from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 7-year grace period, and a final maturity of 22.5 years.

                The Government proposes to integrate a FASTag Bank Mechanism with e-way bill and Logistic Data Services to track movement of goods and check GST evasion. The Government is contemplating integration of E-Way Bill mechanism of GST with FASTag System of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). The aspect of Logistic Databank integration with FASTag System is being examined.

A Committee of Officers comprising of officers from Central Government, State Governments, GSTN (Goods and Services Tax Network), NIC (National Informatics Centre), GST Council, to examine the issue of use of RFID data for strengthening of E-Way Bill mechanism under GST, was formed by GST Council. The representatives of NHAI and NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) were also co-opted in the committee. The Committee of Officers has submitted its report to the GST Council, recommending integration of FASTag system with E-Way Bill mechanism. The recommendations of the Committee are under consideration by GST Council. Further, with regard to integration of FASTag with LDB, a committee comprising of Central Board and Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), NHAI & its associates, NPCI, GSTN, NIC, Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (DMICDC) & its associates was formed to examine the feasibility of the same. The committee has submitted its report, which is being examined.

                Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued Guidelines for ‘on tap’ Licensing of Universal Banks in the Private Sector, dated August 1, 2016 for granting licenses for universal banks on a continuous basis. RBI’s Second Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy, 2019-20 dated June 6, 2019, has announced RBI’s intention to issue Draft Guidelines for ‘on tap’ Licensing of Small Finance Banks by the end of August 2019. Post 2014, RBI has licensed two New Private Sector Banks (in 2015), ten Small Finance Banks and seven Payments Banks (during 2016 and 2017), details of which are at Annexure.

 

RBI has informed that it has not received any application from any State Government for setting up of a new State level bank.


RBI issues licences to carry out banking business to co-operative banks under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (as applicable to Co-operative Societies). RBI regulates the banking functions of co-operative banks under the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. These banks are also required to comply with instructions/ guidelines etc. issued by RBI from time to time.

 

This was stated by the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                Public Sector Banks (PSBs) lead in the delivery of loan service in many respects. PSBs have taken the initiative for hassle-free and expeditious in principle approval for loans to MSMEs in contactless digital mode through the psbloansin59minutes.com platform, which private sector banks have subsequently on-boarded. PSBs also lead in lending in several loan categories, such as loans for education and for priority sector agriculture and allied activities, in which PSBs account for 96% (as on 30.9.2018, as per RBI data) and 76% (as on 31.3.2019, as per RBI data) respectively of lending by Scheduled Commercial Banks. Further, PSBs have led in extending credit through the overdraft facility available under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) to accountholders having satisfactory conduct of account, accounting for over 99.8% (including through Regional Rural Banks, which are sponsored by PSBs) of the total overdraft amount availed of as on 14.6.2019. In addition, all PSBs have on-boarded the Trade Receivable electronic Discounting System (TReDs) platform, enabling online discounting of trade receivables by MSMEs for faster realisation against the receivables.

                The implementation of GST has led to the removal of cascading effect of taxes in the economy as well as promoting free movement of goods across States, thereby creating “one nation, one market”. A simplified tax regime has resulted in reduced compliance burden for taxpayers and promoting ease of doing business in the country.

 

Return filing is a continuous process and technical glitches and system related issues are addressed by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) to ensure smooth filing. Also, taxpayers committed errors while filing returns due to lack of familiarity with the new system. The data regarding the number of returns filed until 17.06.2019 is as follows:


Return Form Number of returns filed till 17.06.2019

FORM GSTR-1 9,66,74,296

FORM GSTR-3B 17,58,18,725

FORM GSTR-4 99,93,521

 

In order to address these issues, the Government took the following steps:

 


	The last date for filing of details of outward supplies in FORM GSTR-1 and that of FORM GSTR-3B has been extended from time to time for the benefit of taxpayers. 
	Late fees paid for not filing return on due date for the months of July, 2017 to September, 2017 was exempted. For subsequent months, the amount of late fees payable by taxpayers has been reduced.
	The Government has waived late fees for non-filers of FORM GSTR-1 and FORM GSTR-3B for the period from July, 2017 till September, 2018, if such forms are filed from 22.12.2018 to 31.03.2019.
	Based on the feedback received from taxpayers, Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN) regularly updates the User Interface for filing of returns so as to improve user experience. For example, a Questionnaire for filing FORM GSTR-3B has been introduced to avoid errors by taxpayers. Also, NIL returns can be filed with just one click.
	An IT-Grievance Redressal Committee has been put in place to address the difficulties faced by taxpayers owing to technical glitches on the GST portal. It has the mandate to approve and recommend to the GSTN the steps to be taken to redress the grievance and provide relief to taxpayers.
	Awareness campaigns such as seminars, workshops, open houses, use of social media, advertisements in print and electronic media etc. were carried out across the country to educate the taxpayers about return filing and other legal provisions under GST. Help Centres have also been established to provide assistance to taxpayers in return filing and related issues.

                The 35th GST Council Meeting was held here today under the chairmanship of Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman. This was the first meeting of the Council after the swearing in of the new Government. The meeting was also attended by Union Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs Shri Anurag Thakur besides Revenue Secretary Shri Ajay Bhushan Pandey and other senior officials of the Ministry of Finance. The meeting took place in a cordial and professional manner. 

At the start of the meeting, the Council passed a resolution acknowledging the stellar role played by Shri Arun Jaitley, the former Chairperson of GST Council and expressed its gratitude and appreciation for the exemplary contribution made by him in making the GST Council a shining example of co-operative federalism that it has become today. The Council also thanked the outgoing Members and welcomed the new Members of the Council. It also expressed its deepest condolences at the untimely demise of Shri Prakash Pant, the former Finance Minister of Uttarakhand.  

Altogether, 12 Agenda items were discussed during the Council meeting. Some of these items were of regular nature like confirmation of the Minutes of the 34th GST Council Meeting, deemed ratification by the Council of notifications, circulars and orders issued by the Central Government between 12th March, 2019 and 11th June, 2019, taking note of the decisions of GST Implementation Committee, etc.

The Council took a decision regarding location of the State and the Area Benches for the Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) for various States and Union Territories with legislature. It has been decided to have a common State Bench for the States of Sikkim, Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.

The tenure of National Anti-Profiteering Authority has been extended by 2 years.

The Council also decided to introduce electronic invoicing system in a phase-wise manner for B2B transactions. E-invoicing is a rapidly expanding technology which would help taxpayers in backward integration and automation of tax relevant processes. It would also help tax authorities in combating the menace of tax evasion. The Phase 1 is proposed to be voluntary and it shall be rolled out from January 2020

                The Directorate General of GST Intelligence Hqrs. (DGGI Hqrs.) has arrested one person, namely, Sh. Munish Kumar, Partner of M/s Sushil Kumar Munish Kumar, Hisar, Haryana and controller of M/s Sushil Kumar Munish Kumar & Co., Ahmedabad. Both of the said firms had taken ITC fraudulently to the tune of more than Rs.16 Crore involving invoice value of Rs.322 Crore on the strength of invoices issued by non-existent fake firms. The said two firms thereafter, passed on such fraudulently taken ITC to some of the well established Cotton Yarn Spinners who availed of the same to discharge their GST liability against the outward supply, with an ulterior motive to defraud the Government Exchequer. Shri Munish Kumar has during the investigations conducted by the DGGI Hqrs. admitted that both of the said firms had taken ITC fraudulently on the invoices issued by non-existent fake firms and then passed on such ITC to the various Spinners. Thus, Sh. Munish Kumar has committed offences under the provisions of Sections 132(1)(b) and 132(1)(c) of the CGST Act, 2017; which are cognizable and non-bailable offences under Section 132(5) of the CGST Act, 2017, being punishable under Section 132(1)(i) of the CGST Act, 2017. Consequently, Sh. Munish Kumar was arrested on 21.06.2019 under Section 69(1) of the CGST Act, 2017, following which he was produced before the CMM, New Delhi at Patiala House Courts. The CMM has consigned Sh. Munish Kumar to judicial custody of 14 days. During the investigations conducted so far into the fake billing racket in the cotton industry, the DGGI Hqrs. has recovered an amount of Rs.28 Crore towards the GST evaded. Further investigations in the matter are in progress.

                Since Apr-June (Q1) 2010-11, Public Debt Management Cell (PDMC) (earlier Middle

Office), Budget Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has been bringing out a quarterly report on debt management on a regular basis. The current report pertains to the quarter Jan - March 2019 (Q4 FY 2019).

During Q4 of FY19, the Central Government issued dated securities worth `1,56,000 crore as against ₹67,000 crore in Q4 of FY18. The weighted average maturity (WAM) of new issuances stood at 14.18 years in Q4 of FY19 (14.70 years in Q3 of FY 19). The weighted average yield (WAY) of issuances for the same quarter was 7.47 per cent compared to 7.82 per cent in Q3 of FY 19. The temporary cash flow mismatches were bridged through issuance of Cash Management Bills amounting to ₹60,000 crore during the quarter. The net average liquidity injection by RBI under Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) including MSF was ₹52,364 crore during the quarter.

The total liabilities (including liabilities under the ‘Public Account’) of the Government, increased to ₹84,68,086 crore at end-March 2019 from ₹83,40,027 crore at end-December 2018. Public debt accounted for 89.5 per cent of total outstanding liabilities at end-March 2019. Nearly 28.27 per cent of the outstanding dated securities had a residual maturity of less than 5 years. The holding pattern indicates a share of 40.5 per cent for commercial banks and 24.6 per cent for insurance companies by end-December 2018. 

G-Sec yields have softened in Q4 of FY19 with the decrease in weighted average yield of primary issuances to 7.47 per cent from 7.82 per cent in Q3 of FY 19 reflecting the impact of several developments namely decline in WPI and CPI inflation, reduction in the policy repo rate under the LAF by 25 bps, OMO purchase auction (sell/ buy/ swap) and narrowing of trade deficit during Feb-March 2019. The yield on 10-year benchmark G-Sec (7.26% GS 2029) closed at 7.35 per cent on March 29, 2018. Central Government dated securities continued to account for a major share of total trading volumes in the secondary market, with a share of 83 per cent in total outright trading volumes in value terms during Q4 of FY19.

                Some newspapers have today highlighted a perceived set-back to the automated process of refunds for exporters under GST on account of the introduction of manual checks to curb large scale frauds in IGST refunds. These news items regrettably create a misleading impression that genuine exporters would suffer on account of the newly introduced verification process.

The CBIC has recently instructed its Customs and GST formations to verify the correct availment of input tax credit (ITC) by few exporters who are perceived as “risky” on the basis of pre-defined risk parameters. Only 5,106 risky exporters have been identified so far as against about 1.42 lakh total exporters.  Thus the risky exporters are only 3.5% of the total exporters.  Further, in the last two days i.e. 17.06.2019 and 18.06.2019 only 1,436 Shipping Bills filed by total 925 exporters have been interdicted. Considering that about 20,000 Shipping Bills are filed by roughly 9,000 exporters on a daily basis, the intervention is negligible.  Even for these risky exporters, the exports are allowed immediately. However, the refund would be released after verification of ITC within a maximum of 30 days.

The new verification exercise is aimed at preventing unscrupulous exporters from defrauding the exchequer and bringing a bad name to the larger exporting community.  CBIC would like to assure all genuine exporters that they would continue to get their IGST refunds in a timely manner in a fully automated environment.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved theratification of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI)

Impact: 

The Convention will modify India's treaties in order to curb revenue loss through treaty abuse and base erosion and profit shifting strategies by ensuring that profits are taxed where substantive economic activities generating the profits are carried out and where value is created.

Details:

i.      India has ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which was signed by the Hon'ble Finance Minister Sh. Arun Jaitley at Paris on 07/06/2017 on behalf of India.

ii.     The Multilateral Convention is an outcome of the OECD / G20 Project to tackle Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the ""BEPS Project"") i.e., tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity, resulting in little or no tax being paid. The BEPS Project identified 15 actions to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) in a comprehensive manner.

iii.    India was part of the Ad Hoc Group of more than 100 countries and jurisdictions from G20, OECD, BEPS associates and other interested countries, which worked on an equal footing on the finalization of the text of the Multilateral Convention, starting May 2015. The text of the Convention and the accompanying Explanatory Statement was adopted by the Ad hoc Group on 24 November 2016.

iv.     The Convention enables all signatories, inter alia, to meet treaty-related minimum standards that were agreed as part of the Final BEPS package, including the minimum standard for the prevention of treaty abuse under Action 6.

v.    The Convention will operate to modify tax treaties between two or more Parties to the Convention. It will not function in the same way as an amending protocol to a single existing treaty, which would directly amend the text of the Covered Tax Agreement. Instead, it will be applied alongside existing tax treaties, modifying their application in order to implement the BEPS measures.

vi.   The Convention will modify India's treaties in order to curb revenue loss through treaty abuse and base erosion and profit shifting strategies by ensuring that profits are taxed where substantive economic activities generating the profits are carried out and where value is created.

 

Background: 

The Convention is one of the outcomes of the OECD/G20 project, of which India is a member, to tackle base erosion and profit shifting. The Convention enables countries to implement the tax treaty related changes to achieve anti-abuse BEPS outcomes through the multilateral route without the need to bilaterally re-negotiate each such agreement which is burdensome and time consuming. It ensures consistency and certainty in the implementation of the BEPS Project in a multilateral context. Ratification of the Multilateral Convention will enable application of BEPS outcomes through modification of existing tax treaties of India in a swift manner. The Cabinet Note seeking ratification of the MLI was sent to the Cabinet on 16.04.2019 for consideration. Since the said Note for Cabinet could not be taken up in the Cabinet, due to urgency, the Hon'ble Prime Minister vide Cabinet Secretariat I.D. No. 216/1/2/2019-Cab dated 27.05,2019 has approved Ratification of MLI and India's Final Position under Rule 12 of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961 with a direction that ex-post facto approval of the Cabinet be obtained within a month. Consequent to approval under Rule 12, a separate request has already been sent to L&T Division, MEA for obtaining instrument of ratification from the Hon'ble President of India vide this office OM F.No. 500/71/2015-FTD-I/150 dated 31/05/2019.

                The Income Tax Department conducted search and seizure operations today on a prominent business group based in Srinagar, covering 8 premises in Srinagar and 1 each at Bangalore and Delhi. The assessee group is engaged in the business of transportation, manufacturing of silk yarn, hospitality, retail trading of Kashmir Arts & Crafts etc.

None of the members of the group is regular in filing their Income Tax Returns. As a one time settlement, the group has got their loans of Rs 170 crores with J&K Bank restructured for a sum of Rs 77 crores, out of which, payment of only Rs 50.34 crores to the J&K Bank has been made so far and balance of Rs 27.66 crores is yet to be paid. During the search, evidence has been detected indicating that the one time settlement of the loan from J&K Bank has been done through the active connivance of a senior J&K Bank officer who was receiving several out of turn promotions. Furthermore, evidence has also been unearthed indicating that the repayment of Rs 50.34 crores pertaining to the said loan has been greenfielded by the J&K Bank by granting loan of similar amount to an associate who has confessed to his role in layering the entire transaction.

During the search, incriminating evidence has also been found relating to:


	sale of undisclosed property amounting to Rs 22 crores. 
	agreement to sell Transport business for Rs 9.10 crores.
	undisclosed profit of Rs 15-20 crores on account of sale of Cold Storage plant at Lassipora. The cost of this project was found to have been inflated to Rs 47 crores instead of the actual cost of Rs 17 crores, for claiming more subsidy from the government by raising inflated and bogus bills. The loan for this project was taken from J&K Bank.
	undisclosed properties at Sonmarg (Rs 2.68 crores), Pahalgam (Rs 3.55 crores) and Bangalore (Rs 1 crore).
	one shop in partnership in Delhi purchased for Rs.1.02 crore.

                The GST Council in its 31st meeting decided that a new GST return system will be introduced to facilitate taxpayers. In order to ease transition to the new return system, a transition plan has been worked out. The details of the indicative transition plan are as follows: -


	In May, 2019 a prototype of the offline tool has already been shared on the common portal to give the look and feel of the tool to the users. The look and feel of the offline tool would be same as that of the online portal. Taxpayers may be aware that there are three main components to the new return – one main return (FORM GST RET-1) and two annexures (FORM GST ANX-1 and FORM GST ANX-2). 
	From July, 2019, users would be able to upload invoices using the FORM GST ANX-1 offline tool on trial basis for familiarisation. Further, users would also be able to view and download, the inward supply of invoices using the FORM GST ANX-2 offline tool under the trial program. The summary of inward supply invoices would also be available for view on the common portal online. They would also be able to import their purchase register in the Offline Tool and match it with the downloaded inward supply invoices to find mismatches from August 2019.
	Between July to September, 2019 (for three months), the new return system (ANX-1 & ANX-2 only) would be available for trial for taxpayers to make themselves familiar. This trial would have no impact at the back end on the tax liability or input tax credit of the taxpayer. In this period, taxpayers shall continue to fulfil their compliances by filing FORM GSTR-1 and FORM GSTR-3B i.e. taxpayers would continue to file their outward supply details in FORM GSTR-1 on monthly / quarterly basis and return in FORM GSTR-3B on monthly basis. Non-filing of these returns shall attract penal provisions under the GST Act. 
	From October, 2019 onwards, FORM GST ANX-1 shall be made compulsory and FORM GSTR-1 would be replaced by FORM GST ANX-1. The large taxpayers (i.e. those taxpayers whose aggregate annual turnover in the previous financial year was more than Rs. 5 Crore) would upload their monthly FORM GST ANX-1 from October, 2019 onwards. However, the first compulsory quarterly FORM GST ANX-1 to be uploaded by small taxpayers (with aggregate annual turnover in the previous financial year upto Rs. 5 Crore) would be due only in January, 2020 for the quarter October to December, 2019. It may be noted that invoices etc. can be uploaded in FORM GST ANX-1 on a continuous basis both by large and small taxpayers from October, 2019 onwards.  FORM GST ANX-2 may be viewed simultaneously during this period but no action shall be allowed on such FORM GST ANX-2.
	For October and November, 2019, large taxpayers would continue to file FORM GSTR-3B on monthly basis. They would file their first FORM GST RET-01 for the month of December, 2019 by 20th January, 2020.
	 The small taxpayers would stop filing FORM GSTR-3B and would start filing FORM GST PMT-08 from October, 2019 onwards. They would file their first FORM GST-RET-01 for the quarter October, 2019 to December, 2019 from 20th January, 2020. 
	From January, 2020 onwards, all taxpayers shall be filing FORM GST RET-01 and FORM GSTR-3B shall be completely phased out. 


  Separate instructions shall be issued for filing and processing of refund applications between October to December, 2019.

                Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Government of India, participated in the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting and associated events during June 8-9, 2019 at Fukuoka, Japan. She was accompanied by Shri Subhash C. Garg, Finance Secretary & Secretary Economic Affairs, Dr. Viral Acharya, Deputy Governor of RBI and other officers. 

Smt. Sitharaman noted the urgency to fix the issue of determining right nexus and profit allocation solution for taxing the profits made by digital economy companies.  Appreciating the significant progress made under the taxation agenda including the Base Erosion and Profit Shifitng (BEPS), tax challenges from digital economy and exchange of information under the aegis of G20, Smt. Sitharaman congratulated the Japanese Presidency for successfully carrying these tasks forward. 

The Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs noted that the work on tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of economy is entering a critical phase with an update to the G20, due next year. In this respect, Smt. Sitharaman strongly supported the potential solution based on the concept of ‘significant economic presence’ of businesses taking into account the evidence of their purposeful and sustained interaction with the economy of a country. This concept has been piloted by India and supported by large number of countries including the G-24. She expressed confidence that a consensus-based global solution, which should also be equitable and simple, would be reached by 2020.

Smt. Sitharaman welcomed the commencement of automatic exchange of financial account information (AEOI) on a global basis with almost 90 jurisdictions successfully exchanging information in 2018. This would ensure that tax evaders could no more hide their offshore financial accounts from the tax administration. She urged the G20/Global Forum to further expand the network of automatic exchanges by identifying jurisdictions including developing countries and financial centers that are relevant but have not yet committed to any timeline. Appropriate action needs to be taken against non-compliant jurisdictions. In this respect she called upon the international community to agree on a toolkit of defensive measures, which can be taken against such non-compliant jurisdictions.

Earlier, the Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs participated in the Ministerial Symposium on International Taxation and spoke in the session on the ongoing global efforts to counter tax avoidance and evasion. During the session, she also spoke on the tax challenges for addressing digitalisation of the economy and emphasised that nexus was important. 

Smt. Sitharaman also raised the need for international cooperation on dealing with fugitive economic offenders who flee their countries to escape from the consequences of law. She informed about the fugitive economic offenders law passed by India which provides for denial of access to courts until the fugitive returns to the country. This law also provides for confiscation of their properties and selling them off. She drew attention to the practice permitted by many jurisdictions, which allow economic offenders to use investment-based schemes to obtain residence or citizenship to escape from legal consequences and underlined the need to deal with such practices. She urged that closer collaboration and coordinated action were required to bring such economic offenders to face law.

Smt. Sitharaman highlighted the need for the G20 to keep a close watch on global current account imbalances to ensure that they do not result in excessive global volatility and tensions. The global imbalances left a detrimental impact on the growth of emerging markets. Unilateral actions taken by some advanced economies adversely affect the exports and the inward flow of investments in these economies. She wondered if the accumulation of cash reserves by large companies indicated the reluctance of these companies to increase investments. This reluctance could have adverse implications on growth and investments and possibly leading to concentration of market power. She also urged the G20 to remain cognizant of fluctuations in international oil market and study measures that can bring benefits to both the oil exporting and importing countries.

In another session on infrastructure investment, Smt. Sitharaman emphasised on the importance of making investments in cost-effective and disaster resilient infrastructure for growth and development. She suggested the G20 focus on identifying constraints to flow of resources into infrastructure sector in the developing world and solutions for overcoming them. She also took note of the close collaboration of India, Japan and other like-minded countries, aligned with the Sendai Framework, in developing a roadmap to create a global Coalition on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.

The Japanese Presidency’s priority issue of aging was also discussed. Smt. Sitharaman highlighted that closer collaboration between countries with high old age dependency ratio and those with low old age dependency ratio was necessary for dealing with the policy challenges posed by ageing. She suggested that if ageing countries with shrinking labour force allow calibrated mobility of labour with portable social security benefits, the recipient countries can not only take care of the aged but also have positive effect on global growth. Smt. Sitharaman said that India’s demography presented a dual policy challenge since India’s old age dependency ratio is lesser than Japan while at the same time India’s aged population in absolute numbers exceeds that of Japan. She detailed the policy measures that Government of India is taking to address these challenges.

While speaking on the priority of Japanese Presidency on financing of universal health coverage (UHC) she emphasised the importance of a holistic approach which encompasses plurality of pathways to achieve UHC, including through traditional and complementary systems of medicine. 

Smt. Sitharaman also held bilateral meeting with Mr Phillip Hammod, Chancellor of United Kingdom on the sidelines of the FMCBG meeting at Fukuoka and discussed efforts undertaken by both sides for closer collaboration between India and United Kingdom in several areas and enhance cooperation between the two countries in tax matters.

                RBI data on frauds reported to it by banks has been cited in sections of the media to paint a picture of rising frauds in banks in recent years. The fact is that this data is by the year of reporting and not the year of occurrence of the fraud or sanction of loan, Letter of Undertaking etc., which in many cases is of an earlier period. Occurrence of frauds was enabled by laxity in the financial system which has been systematically dealt with through comprehensive banking reforms instituted by the Government to address underlying causes and provide for proactive checking for and detection of frauds. Key steps taken in this regard include:

 

·      Government has issued instruction that all accounts exceeding Rs. 50 crore, if classified as NPAs, be examined by banks from the angle of possible fraud. In addition, Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have also been advised to seek a report on the borrower from the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau, in case an account turns NPA.

·      Proactive action has been taken against wilful defaulters, with FIRs being registered by PSBs against 2,881 wilful defaulters.

·      For enforcement of auditing standards and ensuring the quality of audits, Government has established National Financial Reporting Authority as an independent regulator.

·      Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 has been enacted in order to deter economic offenders from evading the process of Indian law by remaining outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts.

·      Pursuant to Government’s advice to PSBs, they have been obtaining certified copy of passport of the promoters/directors and other authorised signatories of companies availing loan facilities of more than Rs. 50 crore, and are ensuring rotational transfer of officials/employees on sensitive posts.

 

Above position has been clarified in response to Rajya Sabha Starred Question no. 198, replied on 1.1.2019, copy of which is annexed.

With a view to redress genuine hardship of deductors in timely filing of TDS statement in Form 24Q on account of revision of its format and consequent updating of the File Validation Utility for its online filing, CBDT has ordered the following:

(i) Extended the due date of filing of TDS statement in Form 24Q for financial year 2018-19 from 31st of May, 2019 to 30th of June, 2019 and

(ii) Extended the due date for issue of TDS certificate in Form 16 for financial year 2018-19 from 15th of June, 2019 to 10th of July, 2019.

Order dated 04.06.2019 issued under section 119 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 to this effect is available on www.incometaxindia.gov.in.

                The Government of India, Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) and the World Bank  signed here today in New Delhi a $287 Million Loan Agreement for the Tamil Nadu Health System Reform Program. The Program aims to improve the quality of health care, reduce the burden of Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs), and fill equity gaps in reproductive and child health services in the State of Tamil Nadu.

Tamil Nadu ranks third among all Indian States in the NITI Aayog Health Index which is reflected in vastly improved health outcomes. The State’s maternal mortality rate has declined from 90 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 62 deaths in 2015-16 while infant mortality has declined from 30 deaths per 1000 live births to 20 in the same period. A key contribution to these achievements has been the establishment of emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care Centers and the 108 ambulance service with previous support from the World Bank.  These have ensured that no mother has to travel more than 30 minutes to access emergency obstetric and neonatal care 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  

Despite these impressive gains, certain challenges in health care remain, including quality of care and variations in reproductive and child health among districts. Tamil Nadu is also dealing with a growing burden of NCDs as they account for nearly 69 percent of deaths in the State. 

The Tamil Nadu Health System Reform Program will support the State Government to:

 


	develop clinical protocols and guidelines;
	achieve national accreditation for primary, secondary, and tertiary-level health facilities in the public sector;
	strengthen physicians, nurses and paramedics through continuous medical education;
	strengthen the feedback loop between citizens and the state by making quality and other data accessible to the public.


 

""Tamil Nadu can serve as a model for how to take health system performance to the next level by investing in the public sector and offer lessons to other states. We are happy that the World Bank is helping the state in this journey,"" said Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. 

The Agreement for the Project was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India, Beela Rajesh, Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, on behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu and Mr. Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank. 

“The Program supports interventions to strengthen institutional and state capacity to achieve results. Good practices and innovations from Tamil Nadu are being scaled-up while others from around the world are being introduced through the program to improve management of the State's Public Health Sector, increase transparency, and strengthen accountability,” said Mr. Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank. 

The Program will promote population-based screening, treatment and follow-up for NCDs, and improve monitoring and evaluation. Patients will be equipped with knowledge and skills to self-manage their conditions. Lab services and health provider capacity will also be strengthened to address mental health. To tackle road injuries, the program will improve in-hospital care, strengthen protocols, strengthen the 24x7 trauma care services and establish a trauma registry.

 Another key aim of this Program is to reduce the equity gaps in reproductive and child health.  Special focus will be given to nine priority districts, which constitute the bottom quintile of the RCH indicators in the State and have a relatively large proportion of tribal populations.  

“This Program focuses on results instead of inputs through a Program-for-Results (PforR) lending instrument. This will provide a much greater focus on outputs and outcomes through better alignment of expenditures and incentives with results,” said Mr. Rifat Hasan, Senior Health Specialist, World Bank India, and the Task Team Leader for the Program. The use of the PforR instrument is a first for the health sector and will offer lessons for other States.

		Particulars of the transactions for FY 2017-18 declared in returns between April 2018 to March 2019 shall be declared in Pt. V of FORM GSTR-9. Such particulars may contain details of amendments furnished in Table 10 and Table 11 of FORM GSTR-1.
		It may be noted that irrespective of when the supply was declared in FORM GSTR-1, the principle of declaring a supply in Pt. II or Pt. V is essentially driven by when was tax paid through FORM GSTR-3B in respect of such supplies. If the tax on such supply was paid through FORM GSTR-3B between July 2017 to March 2018 then such supply shall be declared in Pt. II and if the tax was paid through FORM GSTR-3B between April 2018 to March 2019 then such supply shall be declared in Pt. V of FORM GSTR-9.  
		Any additional outward supply which was not declared by the registered person in FORM GSTR-1 and FORM GSTR-3B shall be declared in Pt.II of the FORM GSTR-9. Such additional liability shall be computed in Pt.IV and the gap between the “tax payable” and “Paid through cash” column of FORM GSTR-9 shall be paid through FORM DRC-03.
		Many taxpayers have reported a mismatch between auto-populated data and the actual entry in their books of accounts or returns. One common challenge reported by taxpayer is in Table 4 of FORM GSTR-9 where details may have been missed in FORM GSTR-1 but tax was already paid in FORM GSTR-3B and therefore taxpayers see a mismatch between auto-populated data and data in FORM GSTR-3B. It may be noted that auto-population is a functionality provided to taxpayers for facilitation purposes, taxpayers shall report the data as per their books of account or returns filed during the financial year.
		Many taxpayers have represented that Table 8 has no row to fill in credit of IGST paid at the time of import of goods but availed in the return of April 2018 to March 2019. Due to this, there are apprehensions that credit which was availed between April 2018 to March 2019 but not reported in the annual return may lapse. For this particular entry, taxpayers are advised to fill in their entire credit availed on import of goods from July 2017 to March 2019 in Table 6(E) of FORM GSTR-9 itself. 
		Payments made through FORM DRC-03 for any supplies relating to period between July 2017 to March 2018 will not be accounted for in FORM GSTR-9 but shall be reported during reconciliation in FORM GSTR-9C.
	
	


 

All the taxpayers are requested to file their Annual Return (FORM GSTR-9) at the earliest to avoid last minute rush.

                There are institutional mechanisms at the National and State level for effective management of natural disasters. As reported by Disaster Management Division, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), though the primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments, Central Government extends all possible logistics and financial supports to the States to supplement their efforts to meet the situation effectively. The concerned State Governments undertake assessment of damage and provide financial relief in the wake of natural disasters including cyclone, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal. Additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) by following the laid down procedure by MHA. Financial assistance under SDRF/ NDRF in the wake of natural disasters is by way of relief and not for compensation of loss suffered/ claimed. Items and Norms of financial assistance under SDRF/NDRF inter aliaincludes assistance to fisherman.

With regard to damages to Fisheries Sector by Cyclone ‘Gaja’, the Central Government inter alia had approved the assistance of Rs.3.88 crore to the State of Tamil Nadu and Rs.0.83 crore to the Union Territory of Puducherry and released the amount.Further, in order to support the affected people of the States due to cyclone ‘Fani’, Central Government has released in advance an assistance of Rs. 1086 crore (Rs. 340.875 crore to Odisha, Rs. 200.25 crore to Andhra Pradesh, Rs. 235.50 crore to West Bengal and Rs. 309.375 crore to Tamil Nadu) from SDRF on 29th April 2019. In pursuance to the visit made by Hon’ble Prime Minister to Odisha after the cyclone ‘Fani’, Central Government released additional amount of Rs. 1000 crore to Government of Odisha on 7th May 2019.The medium and long term reconstruction and rehabilitation measures falls outside the purview of the norms/guidelines of SDRF/NDRF. Accordingly, State Governments are required to suitably address/undertake all necessary measures for rehabilitation, reconstruction and mitigation of medium/long terms works activities and allocate sufficient funds under ongoing regular scheme/plan etc.

                As per the information provided by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, a list of licensed slaughter houses in the country is annexed.

As per Basic Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Statistics 2018, number of Cattle slaughtered during 2017-18 was 34.10 lakhs. If any, instances of cattle smuggling reported along the Indo-Bangladesh Border, information is being collected and will be laid on the Table of the House. 

Under the distribution of legislatives powers between the Union of India and States under Article 246(3) of the Constitution, the preservation of cattle is a matter on which the legislature of the States has exclusive powers to legislate. Therefore, it is up to the States to enact laws on slaughter of cows. Further as per article 48 of Indian Constitution the state  shall endeavour to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall in particular take steps for preserving improving the breed, and prohibiting the slaughter, of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle. As regards to information on effective steps taken by the Central Government for prohibiting trade and smuggling in the neighbouring countries is being collected and will be laid on the Table on the House. 

Several States have enacted laws banning cow slaughter and provision of penalizing the accused person has been provided in the State act.  Further, ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and therefore, the State Governments are primarily responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and for prosecuting the criminals through the machinery of their law Enforcement agencies, as also for protecting the life and property of the citizens.

National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India (NCDFI) informed that, they have launched an online marketplace namely “NCDFI e-Market” in June, 2015 for trading of bulk dairy commodities i.e. Skimmed Milk Powder and Butter. Presently, only member cooperatives of NCDFI are allowed to sell at the portal. Major dairy cooperatives like Karnataka milk Federation Ltd(Nandini dairy) and Gujarat Milk marketing Federation Ltd(Amul) have their own digital platform to sell their milk products. Besides above, as per information available at cyberspace(Internet), a number of private digital platforms like www.countrydelight.in, www.awesomedairy.com, www.grofers.com, www.naturesbasket.co.in, www.fast2cart.com, www.bigbasket.com etc. also market dairy products in the country.   

 

No survey has been conducted by  Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) on purchase of dairy products from farmers as farmers are exempt from the provisions of FSS Act, 2006. However, FSSAI has conducted a National Milk Quality Survey (NMQS) on Quality of Milk, initiated in May 2018 and released interim report on dated 13.11.2018.

Cases of  sale/supply of sub-standard and   adulterated milk  are detected during the enforcement activities undertaken by the State/UT Governments . Such complaints have also been received in FSSAI through various other channels. As per information received from State/UT Governments, the number of milk samples analyzed found non-conforming and action taken thereon for the year 2017-18 is as under:


	
		
			
			Sl. No
			
			
			Details

                This Department does not regulate the prices of milk in the country. Prices are decided by the Cooperative and Private dairies based on cost of production. Since milk is a highly perishable product, this department does not have any proposal to fix MSP for milk in the country.

                Agriculture and its allied subjects namely Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries are state subjects. The Ministry of Fisheries and Animal husbandry, Dairying has been supplementing the efforts of the State Government in this regard. All the States/ UTs have to set up Disaster Management Authorities and have definite Disaster Management plans to meet their specific requirements in view of their susceptibility to different types of disaster including deaths and diseases caused by scorching heat due to rapidly rising temperature due to rapidly rising temperature.

As far as, the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying has prepared the ‘Disaster Management Plan’ for protecting animals, preventing and mitigation loss of livestock resources during disasters like drought, flood, Heat wave, etc in 2016. This Department has also issued a “Pashupalak Calendar” which is a month wise animal husbandry advisory for the farmers, which also include advisories for the months of April, May, June and July for reducing the impact of high temperature on livestock. In addition, awareness of the farmers to manage their animals during the hot summer months is also being sent by Short Messaging Service (SMS) through the mKisan portal.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Government of India has issued guidelines for ‘Preparation of Action Plan- Prevention and Management of Heat-Wave’ in April, 2016 which includes development of a mitigation plan for reducing the impact of high temperature on livestock. NDMA issues advisories on heat wave to all the heat wave prone states/ UTs which also contain provision for safeguarding of animals. The NDMA also focuses on community sensitization and awareness generation through Social Media, print/ electronic media, advertisements and short TV commercial films on heat waves protection.

This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Balyan in Lok Sabha today.

                Union Minister of State for Food Processing Industries Shri. Ramweswar Teli today inaugurated Computational Modelling and Nanoscale Processing Unit at the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT) in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. The Minister also inaugurated a National Conference on Emerging Techniques in Food Processing.

 

 

 

The Minister said that, India has been at the forefront of food grain production globally and he also thanked the Scientists for their contribution towards production of sufficient food to feed the population. Further, he said that we have a market in food that is booming with an expected figure of Rs. 61 lakh crores in food retail by 2020. India is the world leader in production of milk, banana, mangoes, spices, shrimp, pulses; and second cereals, vegetables and tea. 

The Minister also added that post-harvest loses have plagued the supply chain industry, and it is disheartening that every year, substantial produce is lost. Estimated loss in durables is 3-10%, semi-perishables and commodities as milk, fish, meat and eggs about 10-20%; and 10-20% in fruits and vegetables, and 5-16% in horticultural produce. There arises the need to focus on food processing and preservation; besides food production. In view of the Prime Minister’s Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojna, it is important to understand how the farmers’ income be enhanced through his assets (Sampada). The scheme launched with an outset budget of Rs. 6000 crores aim at alleviating the poor state of farmers and help them achieve true value of their produce. The food processing industries sums up about 32% of India’s total food market. Food processing is an ever changing field wherein there are new discoveries almost every day, and the techniques add on to our knowledge repository to better process, preserve and enrich the food products and their intermediaries.

Talking about the farmers’ welfare, Union Minister mentioned that the Ministry has been instrumental in ensuring the noble cause of helping farmers and have approved 42 mega food parks. The Ministry also provides financial support in the tune of 35% of the total cost of plant and machinery for encouraging growth. In addition, the government has entrusted specialized agro-processing financial institutions to finance/refinance the food processing sector, and has launched neoteric initiatives such as ‘Operation Greens’, to monitor price fluctuations. The government has also instituted policy initiatives such as Rs. 2000 Cr fund for NABARD. 

The Minister appreciated the efforts made by IIFPT in R&D in the field of food processing. From formulating highly nutritious millet ice cream, onion mission programme, advances in computational modelling and nanotechnology, nutritious products with neera; and the upcoming field of 3D printing. He also added, that IIFPT has made remarkable progress in the past 50 years making laudable progress in all areas of food process engineering. We wish to witness many more useful technologies being developed by the institute for the nation and mankind in the near future. 

He added, this conference would be a great opportunity for all academicians, scientists, industry personnel and students to share research ideas that would enlighten our path towards better process and products using food processing. 

Dr. C. Anandharamkrishnan, Director, IIFPT, Dr C N Ravishankar, Director, ICAR-Central Institute of Fisheries Technology and other senior officials also participated in the event.

                Union Minister for Food Processing Industries Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal today said “for the next five years employment generation is going to my focus, especially in rural areas, so that children of farmers do not have to look for employment elsewhere. Farmers should turn into job creators from being job seekers.” She was addressing media after resuming Office here today.

 



 

She informed the Media that Ministry was working on Gram Samriddhi Yojana with World Bank which is going to be launched soon. The programme will focus on micro enterprises with capitalisation of less than 10 lakh rupees. Speaking about the programme she said “the aim is to target small farmers and the Ministry will aim to facilitate creation of 60 to 70 thousand such units within a short time. The pilot project will be done in four states and initiative will be expanded subsequently”.

Smt Badal thanked the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for reposing his faith in her and having confidence in her work to give her the opportunity to work in the same ministry again.

Stressing on her focus areas further, the Minister added “NBFC to provide funds for Food Processing Sector will also be my focus. I will also push for a National Food Processing Policy which I had presented in the last day of the last session”. She highlighted that “World Food India is almost here and it will be bigger and better than last time. I will soon take a review meeting of Officers to understand the progress that has happened in the past few months”.



The Minister welcomed the new Minister of State Shri Rameswar Teli and said that she hoped that with his arrival, food processing sector in North East will get a boost. North East has a tremendous potential and it will be one of her focus geographies henceforth.

                In view of the recent reported Japanese Encephalitis (JE) cases in Assam, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare has dispatched a central team to review the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) situation in the State, today. He has directed the Ministry to extend all support and assistance to the State government. ""I am closely monitoring the situation. The Health Ministry is coordinating with the Government of Assam for prevention and management of JE to ensure that the cases don’t rise in the state"", Dr Harsh Vardhan said.

Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated that the Union Health Ministry is providing all logistical and technical support to the Assam Government in terms of surveillance and diagnostic kits to strengthen their efforts in addressing JE. Noting that community participation and empowerment are the most crucial areas in JE prevention, Dr Harsh Vardhan urged all the stakeholders to start rigorous awareness campaigns regarding the preventive steps to be taken by the communities. 

The central team is headed by Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Additional Secretary, MoHFW and is accompanied by the senior officers from National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, New Delhi. As per the directions of the Union Health Minister the team will reach the state by today evening to review the situation. 

The Union Health Ministry has given the following support to Assam state for effective prevention and control of JE:


	All 27 districts of Assam have been covered under JE vaccination campaign (for 1-15 yrs.) followed by Routine Immunization as part of Immunization Programme. 
	Ten high endemic districts of Assam (Shivsagar Barpeta, Nagaon, Sonitpur, Darrang, Udalguri, Bongaigaon, Cachar, Morigaon, Nalbari) have been included under the multipronged strategy for prevention and control of JE. These districts have also been covered under adult JE vaccination campaign.
	Out of 10 high burdened districts, funds have been provided for establishment of 7 Pediatric ICU (PICU). Of these, 4 PICUs have been made functional.
	For the diagnosis of JE, till date 28 Sentinel Surveillance Hospitals have been identified and MoHFW is providing diagnostic kits to the State free of cost.
	For rehabilitation of JE disabled patients, Central Government has provided funds for strengthening of 2 Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PMR) departments at Dibrugarh Medical College and Guwahati Medical College. 


Japanese Encephalitis is vector-borne encephalitis transmitted by Culex groups of mosquitoes. These mosquitoes breed mainly in rice fields and large water bodies rich in aquatic vegetations. Migratory birds along with pigs in the community play an important role in the transmission of JE from one area to other areas.

                “Let us all work together to make the twenty-first century a human-centered century which has strong and resilient health systems, individuals and communities.”This was stated by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare during his address at the Joint Session of G20 Health and Finance Ministers in Osaka, Japan, today. Dr. Harsh Vardhan further said that the Government of India, led by visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji believes in the philosophy of ‘Sab Ka Saath; Sab Ka Vikas; Sab KaVishwas’, which means ‘inclusive development with everybody’s participation and trust’. “The financing of universal health coverage is a challenge that most developing countries are presently encountering and in this context, India endorses the G20 ‘Shared Understanding Document’,” Dr. Harsh Vardhan mentioned.

In his address at the global ministers’ meet, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that the multi-dimensionality as well as the plurality of pathways towards the achievement of Universal Health Coverage goals are two aspects that we should be mindful of, while deliberating on this subject. “With this understanding, in India, the finance and health ministries collaborate very closely for health sector outcomes,” he added.

Speaking about the big strides India has taken towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that under the dynamic stewardship of the Prime Minister, India launched the world’s largest Universal Health Coverage program, the Ayushman Bharat (Long Live India), which adopts a continuum of care approach and comprises of two inter-related components. He elaborated that the first component of Ayushman Bharat is focused on achieving preventive, promotive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative healthcare through setting up of 150,000 Health and Wellness Centres. Focus on wellness converges India’s traditional knowledge of Yoga, to eat-right, cessation of alcohol & tobacco and creating community awareness about lifestyle changes. A people’s movement on wellness has already begun in India, he said.

“The Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojna (Prime Minister Health Protection Scheme) provides health protection cover to 107.4 million poor and vulnerable families for secondary and tertiary care, assuring hospitalization cover of Rs. 5,00,000 per annum per family,” Dr. Harsh Vardhan informed the participating global health and finance ministers.

The Union Health Minister further said that to generate sustainable resources a new Health and Education Cess of 4% is in place in India. Further, highest tax at very high rates is levied on tobacco products and sweetened carbonated beverages, he stated. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan appreciated G20 Japanese Presidency for identifying financing of Universal Health Care as a priority agenda.  He also acknowledged the work of WHO and World Bank in advancing the Universal Health Coverage agenda. “We will welcome their support in innovative and efficient ways for strategic purchasing, service delivery and health financing,” he stated.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also visited the Suita Hospital at Osaka, Japan today and interacted with the officials at the hospital on the latest research and development in medicine like new centrifugal blood pump and portable heart lung machine.

                The budget for Family Planning is more than 2.5 per cent of the total Reproductive Child Health (RCH) flexi-pool budget. The budget for family planning in 2018-19 was 15.5% percent of the total Reproductive Child Health flexi-pool budget. 

12.7% of the budget was allocated for core FP activities; 0.6% for FP trainings and 2.2% for Program Management.

States propose funds in their National Health Mission- Programme Implementation Plans as per theirpriorities and felt need, hence there is no pre-determined percentage allocated tospecific methods.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                At present, the Government does not have any authentic estimates of allied professions, other than what is being reported by various associations/similar bodies.  On the basis of available information, 53 Allied and Healthcare Professions under 15 recognized categories have been included in the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018, already introduced in RajyaSabha. 

 

As on date, there is no Central regulatory body for allied health professions. However few States are reported to have statutory mechanism for regulation of allied and healthcare related professions (Paramedical Council or State Physiotherapy or Occupational Therapy Council etc.).

 

The Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 provides for regulation and maintenance of standards of education and services by allied & healthcare professionals besides maintenance of Central Register of such professionals, who lack a comprehensive regulatory mechanism.

 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShAshwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                Public Health is a State subject; hence, the responsibility of providing medical assistance to patients of all income group is of respective State/ UT Governments.

The schemes launched under NHM are available free of cost to all income groups visiting in Public Health Facilities at sub district and district level are given below:

During the last three years, no TCF was approved for the State of Maharashtra and Rajasthan. However, setting up of 6 TCFs in Maharashtra and 10 TCFs in Rajasthan had been approved during 11th Five Year Plan (FYP). 

As per the approved guidelines of the Programme ‘Capacity Building for developing Trauma Care Facilities in Government Hospitals on National Highways’, 55 TCFs were approved during the period 2015-16 to 2018-19. 

As per the information provided by the States/ Regional Offices of Directorate General of Health Services, the construction has been completed in 12 trauma care facilities. 

Further, during the review meeting held recently in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the State Governments have been requested to complete the remaining works so that all the TCFs become operational by March, 2020. 

Under the programme namely ‘Capacity Building for developing Trauma Care Facilities in Government Hospitals on National Highways’, it is envisaged to establish a designated TCF at every 100 Km on the Highways by upgrading the existing Government health care facilities to the appropriate level in terms of infrastructure, equipment and manpower.  

As per the information made available by the State Government, basic public facilities are functional in trauma Centre at Medical College, Jhansi.

                To improve access to the transplantation for needy patients by promoting deceased organ donation,the Government has put in place National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP). Under thisprogramme,an apex level National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) at New Delhi and Five Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (ROTTOs) at Chandigarh, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Guwahati have been set up. The Government has released funds to establish State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (SOTTOs) in the States of Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Haryana, Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Odisha and Uttar Pradeshto organize an efficient mechanism for organ and tissue procurement/retrieval to promotedeceased organ and tissue donation. 

 

Further, to improve infrastructure for human organ and tissue retrieval, storage and transplantation in all parts of the country, the Government has:


	Set up National/ Regional Bio-material Centres;
	Provided financial support for establishing new Organ Transplant/retrieval facilities and strengthening of existing Organ Transplant/retrieval facilities.
	Provided training to transplant experts including surgeons, physicians, transplant coordinators, etc.
	Provided financial support for provision of Transplant Coordinators to medical colleges and trauma centres.


 

NOTTO disseminates relevant information to all concerned. A 24x7 callcentre with a toll free helpline number (1800114770) has been made operational. A number of activities, for generating awareness and for imparting training to all those associated with transplant activities including doctors and transplant coordinators, such as celebration of Indian Organ Donation Day every year, seminars, workshops, debates, sports events, walkathons, participation in marathons, nukkadNatak, etc. are organized at different places in the country.

                As informed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), it is aware of advances in proton therapy, a type of Radiation therapy, which is also called proton beam therapy. It uses protons rather than x-rays to treat cancer. At high energy, protons can destroy cancer cells. It can also be combined with x-ray radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. Like x-ray radiation, proton therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy.

 

In the Government sector, research activities for detection and treatment of cancer are mostly carried out by Institutions/Departments such as Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Science and Technology and Department of Atomic Energy. National Cancer Institute (Jhajjar) of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi has also collaborated with National Cancer Institute of USA. As informed by Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), a grant-in-aid Institution under Department of Atomic Energy, it has initiated collaboration with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), C-CAD, RRCAT, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), KEK university Japan etc.

                The Government has published draft rules vide G.S.R. 817 (E) dated 28th August 2018 for inviting public/stakeholder comments for amendment to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 for incorporating provisions relating to regulation of sale and distribution of drugs through e-pharmacy. A large number of suggestions/ comments have been received from the stakeholders, which are being examined. At the same time, the matter is subjudice before various Hon’ble High Courts in the country. Therefore, no timeline for finalization of the rules can be provided. 

Under the Drugs & Cosmetics Act and Rules, sale of spurious drugs is a punishable offence and State Licensing Authorities are empowered to take action in this regard. Accordingly, the complaints as received, are referred to State Licensing Authorities for taking action as per the provisions of the Act and Rules.

                Under Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) vaccines including Hepatitis B are provided free of cost across the country including tribal areas. 

“Public Health and Hospital” being a state subject, the primary responsibility of improving the accessibility of health services for tribal communities is that of respective State/UT government.

 

However, National Health Mission (NHM) supports the efforts of the State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all including tribal communities. Under NHM, tribal areas are given certain relaxed norms as under

 


	Relaxed norms for health facilities: Against the population norms of 5,000, 30,000, and 1,20,000 for setting up of Sub Centre, PHC and CHC respectively, in tribal and desert areas it is 3,000, 20,000 and 80,000 respectively.
	A new norm of ""time to care"" has also been adopted for setting up Sub Health centres in tribal areas under which a Sub Health centre can be set up within 30 minutes of walk from habitation
	States have been provided with the flexibility of relaxing the norm of one ASHA per 1000 population to one ASHA per habitation in Tribal/hilly and difficult areas.
	While other States had Mobile Medical Units per 10 lakh populations subject to capping of 5 MMUs per district, in tribal and hilly states, this norm could be further relaxed as per need. Recently, the norms for MMU have been revised to have additional MMU wherever it exceeds 60patients per day in plain areas and 30 patients per day in tribal/hilly areas. 
	In addition, all tribal majority districts whose composite health index is below the State average, have been identified as High Priority Districts (HPDs). These districts receive higher per capita funding, and are encouraged to adopt innovative approaches to address their peculiar health challenges.


 

In addition to routine immunization sessions, special drives like Mission Indradhanush, Intensified Mission Indradhanush, Gram SwarajAbhiyaan (GSA), Extended Gram SwarajAbhiyaan(eGSA) have been conducted to reach out to left out and hard to reach childrenwhich includes the underserved and hard to reach populations dwelling in forested and tribal areas.

 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

A range of IEC material has been developed around maintenance of good menstrual health, using 360 degree approach to create awareness among adolescent girls about safe and hygienic menstrual health practices. This includes mass and mid media coverage by audio clips and  videosalong with reading material for adolescent girls and job-aids for ASHAs and other field level functionaries for communicating with adolescent girls.

While these States have been named as Low Performing States (LPS), the remaining States have been named as High performing States (HPS).


 


	Exclusion criteria of age of mother as 19 years or above and up to two children only for home and institutional deliveries under the JSY have been removed and eligible mothers are entitled to JSY benefit regardless of any age and any number of children.


 


	BPL pregnant women, who prefer to deliver at home, are entitled to a cash assistance of Rs 500 per delivery regardless of age of women and the number of children.


 


	The Yojana enables the States/UTs to hire the services of a private specialist to conduct Caesarean Section or for the management of Obstetric complications, in the Public Health facilities, where Government specialists are not in place.


 


	States are encouraged to accredit private health facilities for increasing the choice of delivery care institutions.

                The reports appearing at different fora about some cases of overcharging by the private healthcare establishments have come to the notice of the Government. As per the constitutional provisions, ‘Health’ is a State subject. Therefore, such reports are referred to the concerned State Government for appropriate action.

 

Since ‘Health’ is a State subject, State Governments may frame policy to address the unethical practices carried out by private hospitals under the appropriate statutory provisions applicable in the respective State.

 

The Government of India has enacted Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 for registration and regulation of all clinical establishments (both Government and Private) in the Country.  In accordance with the Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Rules, 2012 framed under the aforementioned Act, the clinical establishments (in the States / Union Territories where the said Act is applicable) are, inter-alia,  required to follow Standard Treatment Guidelines as may be issued by Central/State Governments, display their rates at a conspicuous place and charge the rates for each type of procedures and services within the range of rates determined from time to time in consultation with the State Governments. The National Council for Clinical Establishments has developed a standard list of medical procedures and a standard template for costing of medical procedures, and the same have been shared with the States/UTs where the Act is applicable, for appropriate action. The implementation and enforcement of the said Act is within the purview of the State/UT Governments.             

 

As per the provisions of the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, the State Government authorities namely, District Registering Authority at District level and State Council for Clinical Establishments at the State level are responsible for implementation and monitoring of the Act in the respective State/UT. No such concern about the registering / regulating authority has been received from NITI Aayog.

 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShAshwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                Four rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) were conducted in the country during 1992-93(NFHS 1), 1998-99 (NFHS 2), 2005-06 (NFHS-3) and 2015-16 (NFHS-4) with the technical support of International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai. The Three rounds (2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13) of Annual Health Survey (AHS) were carried out, through the Office of Registrar General & Census Commissioner of India, in 284 districts namely Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. 

 

The major findings of  NFHSs and AHSs  are available at link:

http://rchiips.org/NFHS/index.shtml ; and

http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-Common/AHSurvey.htmlrespectively.

 

In NFHS-1, Srinagar region of Jammu and Kashmir was not covered due to Law and Order situation and Sikkim was also not covered as basic parameters for sample selection were not available. 

 

NFHS-1, 2, 3 didn’t cover UTs except Delhi because the objective of the survey then was to provide State level estimates. 

 

The following important steps taken by the Government to ensure compilation of true and objective data in order to help the Government in making its future policies and programmes:

 


	Objective and Scientific sampling procedures including, a complete household listing operation in every Primary Sampling Unit, and the random selection of sample households was adopted to avoid bias.


 


	Elaborative and comprehensive trainings was organised to ensure data quality.


 


	Digital and physical field monitoring was ensured for collectingon computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI).


 


	A Uniform procedure for the implementation of the survey and minimize non-sampling errors was adopted.

                According to National Family Health Survey (NFHS)–IV (2015-16), the prevalence of anemia among women aged 15 to 49 years is 53%. 

 

According to National Family Health Survey (NFHS)–IV (2015-16), the prevalence of anemia among adolescent girls aged 15-19 years is 54%. The disaggregate data of adolescent girls suffering from anemia in the country, urban and rural-wise is not available. 

 

Under the National Health Mission (NHM), the steps taken to tackle anaemia  are:


	AnaemiaMukt Bharat(AMB) has been launched in the year 2018 as part of Intensified National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI)Program for accelerating the annual rate of decline of anemia from one to three percentage points. The target groups for AMB are Children 6-59 months, 5-9 years, Adolescent Girls & Boys of 10-19 years, Women of Reproductive Age (15-49 years), pregnant Women and Lactating mothers. 


 


	Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS) Programme is being implemented to meet the challenge of high prevalence and incidence of anaemia amongst adolescent girls and boys. The intervention under WIFS include supervised weekly ingestion of Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablet (each IFA tablet contains 100mg elemental iron and 500µg folic acid) for 52 weeks in a year.To control worm infestation biannual de-worming with Albendazole 400mg is done, six months apart. 
	Health management information system & Mother Child tracking system is being implemented   for reporting and tracking the cases of anaemic and severely anaemic pregnant women.


 


	Universal screening of pregnant women for anemia is a part of ante-natal care and all pregnant women are provided iron and folic acid tablets during their ante-natal visits through the existing network of sub-centers and primary health centers and other health facilities as well as through outreach activities at Village Health & Nutrition Days (VHNDs).  These women are also counselled for dietary habits.


 


	Pradhan MantriSurakshitMatritvaAbhiyan (PMSMA) has been launched to focus on conducting special ANC check up on 9th of every month with the help of Medical officers/ OBGYN to detect and treat cases of anemia.


 


	Every pregnant woman is given iron and folic acid, after the first trimester, to be taken 1 tablet daily for 6 months during ante-natal and post-natal period each.  Pregnant women, who are found to be clinically anaemic, are given two tablets daily. 


 


	To address anaemia due to worm infestation, deworming of pregnant women is done after first trimester preferably in second trimester of pregnancy.


 


	Operationalization of   Blood Bank in District Hospitals and Blood Storage Unit in Sub district facilities such as Sub-Divisional Hospital/ Community health Centers is being taken to tackle complications due to severe anemia.


 


	To tackle the problem of anemia due to malaria particularly in pregnant women and children, Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs) and Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITBNs) are being distributed in endemic areas.


 


	Health and nutrition education through IEC & BCC to promote dietary diversification, inclusion of iron folate rich food as well as food items that promotes iron absorption. 


 


	MCP Card and Safe Motherhood Booklet is being distributed to the pregnant women for educating them on dietary diversification and promotion of consumption of IFA.


 


	Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material in the form of posters, hoardings, wall-writings and audio-visuals have been developed & disseminated to the States/UTs to promote prevention of anemia.

                In view of the situation arising due to the AES/JE cases in Muzaffarpur and other adjoining districts in Bihar, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare has instructed for deployment of eight advanced life support ambulances (ALS) in the affected districts. Accordingly, eight additional advanced life support ambulances (ALS) have been pressed into service for transportation of critical patients under National Health Mission (NHM). The central teams of 10 pediatricians and five para-medics sent yesterday, have been deployed in the field and have started working in coordination with the state government.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan further added that sixteen senior district officials and medical personnel have been sent to the vulnerable blocks for monitoring and early identification of cases and ensuring daily reporting. Their headquarters have also been shifted to these blocks also, he added

Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the District Collector (DC) has now got involved and is personally taking responsibility. He has deputed the Senior Deputy Collectors (SDC)/District level officers to lead various block teams. These teams will be assisted by a district level Medical Officer and Medical Officer in charge (MOIC) to do the overall work at block level. He further said that the State has been given instructions to switch to daily surveillance and monitoring for detecting early warning signs of the disease. “The State government has started a social audit along with active case finding campaign through house to house survey and moving the prospective patients to the nearest PHC for early intervention. Surprise checks are also being conducted at the PHCs by the Senior Deputy Collectors (SDC). Additionally, the early morning inspection of Anganwadi Centres is also being undertaken by SDCs and Child development Project Officers (CDPOs). They are also distributing of ORS to each house in the affected villages,” he stated. The ANMs and ASHAs have been directed to visit every house for raising awareness about AES/JE by distributing pamphlets and brochures. Awareness is also being created through other measures such as miking and inter-personal communication.

Also, an ICMR team of experts has been deployed at the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) hospital for making the virology lab operational at the earliest, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated. The Union Health Minister further stated that the multi-disciplinary team deployed earlier is reviewing all the case records of AES patients, admitted and treated in 2019. “The team is reviewing the case records of discharged and deceased AES patients at SKMCH using a standardized tool to know the reasons for mortality. We expect to complete the activity in next two to three days. A similar exercise will be undertaken in the Kejriwal Hospital,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said.

The multi-disciplinary team will systematically collect clinical, nutritional and epidemiological information from AES patients hospitalized since 18 May 2019. Blood, urine and CSF samples will be collected from these patients to rule out infectious aetiology. The team will also conduct case-control study (by taking household/village controls) to reconfirm the role of missing meals and litchi consumption (including the quantity). Orientation training of all pediatricians of SKMCH will also be conducted in batches over the next few days on clinical case management and treatment protocol of AES and brief the new team about case assessment, investigations and treatment protocols already in place and request them to continue the same.

Shri Manoj Jhalani, AS & MD (NHM) will visit Muzaffarpur tomorrow and review the overall ongoing operations.

                Subsequent to the high level review of AES/JE in Muzaffarpur (Bihar), Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare has been regularly reviewing the support being provided to the State for its management. He chaired a review meeting to take a stock of the ongoing public health measures for management of the cases, here today. In the meeting, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has directed for five teams of senior pediatricians and para-medics to be sent to Muzaffarpur immediately to further strengthen the state efforts and measures in the affected districts. Ten pediatricians (including five senior consultants) and five para-medics from RML Hospital, Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge Medical College will be part of the five teams. “The teams will strengthen the clinical care to the existing patients in the hospitals and also strengthen surveillance of cases from the peripheral areas,” Dr Harsh Vardhan stated. 

“A high level central team led by Sh. Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, MoHFW has been permanently stationed in the area to monitor the operations since the past three days. Teams have also been constituted for socio-economic survey in these areas to identify and pin point causes linked with the economic status”, the Union Health Minister stated. 

Furthermore, ten additional ambulances have been put into action in the most affected blocks of the districts for round the clock services. Also, 16 nodal officers (teams of senior doctors and an administrative officer) have been deployed at the PHCs in the affected blocks. To further strengthen the health infrastructure and facilitate the transportation of patients to the health facilities, the State Government has also made a provision to reimburse the ambulance charges if the patients are shifted privately by the family to the hospitals.

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare chaired a meeting of a multi-disciplinary group of experts here today. The multi-disciplinary groupdiscussed and deliberated onthe factors causing high child mortality in the reported AES/JE cases in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar, andfurther immediate measures to be taken up to prevent child mortality. In addition to senior officers from the Health Ministry, Ministry of Women and Child Development, experts from AIIMS, NCDC, ICMR, IAP, WHO and CDC were present at the meeting. 

Subsequent to the meeting, the Union Minister stated: “In order to gain deeper knowledge into the factors causing high child mortality in Muzaffarpur and neighboring districts of Bihar, where increased cases of AES/JE have been reported, the expert group met and deliberated at length today. We discussed the socio-economic profile of the households which have reported the reported cases, their nutrition profiles, issues such as the ongoing heatwave, reported high percentage of hypoglycemia in the children who have died, the prevailing health infrastructure in the district and other factors that could significantly be considered in these cases”. Measures to further strengthen the health infrastructure, need for an aggressive awareness campaign in the preceding months when these cases are reported in higher number in order to prevent these cases, need for strengthening the research base to provide sound knowledge on the causes of mortality, active collaboration between the State and Central governments with experts and researchers, were some of the issues taken up for detailed deliberation at the meeting.  

“In the spirit of collaborative and cooperative federalism, the Centre is actively supporting the Bihar Government in immediate measures to contain AES/JE and also to search for long term solutions through evidence generated by sound research. Two central multi-disciplinary teams are already stationed in Bihar and supporting the government presently. Senior officers of the Health Ministry are in regular communication with the state government and providing all needed technical and other support”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated. 

During the meeting, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has instructed for a permanentmulti-disciplinary group of experts to be constituted at the Centre which shall draw experts from NCDC, AIIMS, ICMR, WHO, CDC, IAP, Ministry of Science & Technology, Ministry of Women and Child Development and also include experts in the field of meteorology, nutrition, agricultural science. The group constituted at the national levelwill be anchored in the Health Ministry. “The group should meet regularly during the year to monitor the recommendations of the two central expert teams that are presently stationed in Muzaffarpur and deliberate upon their findings and also any suggestions received from other experts in the matter”, the Union Minister has instructed. “This group shall formulate recommendations for measures to be taken up in case of an outbreak and for immediate control, in addition to a long term understanding about its causes so as to prevent the cases”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan elaborated.

The team will undertake the necessary ground work for setting up state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary research centre at Muzaffarpur. Dr. Harsh Vardhan during his review visit yesterday has assured the State about establishing such a Centre at Muzaffarpur. 

“To establish the cause of the disease, there is urgent need for an inter disciplinary, high quality research team.  The research team shall work with the children suffering from AES/JE looking at various aspects including periodicity, cycle of disease, environmental factors and metrological data, besides other factors”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated.

The inter disciplinary team consists of experts from ICMR, Delhi; NIMHANS, Bangalore; National Institute of Malaria Research; National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad; National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune; National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) Chennai and AIIMS, Delhi. 

The members of the high level central team are:

	Dr Tandale, Scientist F, NIV, Pune
	Dr Arlappa , Scientist F, National Institute of Nutrition , Hyderabad


 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also said thatfive virological labs will be set up in different districts in the State.  The location of the district can be decided in consultation with the State Government and can be funded through NHM, he stated.

In one of the decisions taken during his visit, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has instructed to set up a 100-bedded paediatric ICU at SKMCH by the State Government.Also, in the adjoining districts, 10 bedded paediatric ICUs will be set up with support from the Centre, so that such cases can be given better and exclusive treatment and there is no unnecessary load on the facilities available at SKMCH. 

Emphasising the need for early detection and treatment of hypoglycemia cases,Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that a dedicated team of doctors should be placed in endemic PHCs with required facilities at least for 3 to 4 months before and during onset of disease and they may be incentivised under NHM appropriately. As for present, the concerned PHCs and CHCs should take prompt corrective measures for hypoglycaemia at the facility itself to utilize the golden hour, he added.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also said that Ministry of Earth Science will be requested to upgrade its IMD observatory facility for improved monitoring of climate related parameters such as temperature humidity, rainfall, heat waves, etc., and share it with the State Government and NCDC for better preparedness and management of AES.

                In view of the recent assault on doctors in West Bengal, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare today wrote a letter to the Chief Ministers of all States and UTs drawing their attention for strict action against any person who assaults doctors. 

Expressing deep concern over the recent act of violence against doctors, the Union Health Minister stated that incidents of assaults on doctors are reported from different parts of the country and this leads to sudden strike by doctors, gravely affecting the healthcare services. “Resident doctors in many parts of the country are agitating and not providing healthcare services. Agitations by doctors in West Bengal seem to be getting aggravated and taking shape of strike by both Government and Private sector doctors, all over the country”, he wrote. Representatives from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Delhi Medical Association (DMA) also called on Dr. Harsh Vardhan today.

Stressing further on the need for avoiding such incidents in future, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the law enforcement should prevail so that doctors and clinical establishments discharge their duties and professional pursuit without fear of any violence. “Strict action against any person who assaults them, must be ensured by the law enforcement agencies,” he emphasized. 

In his letter to the Chief Ministers, Dr. Harsh Vardhan cited a letter (dated 7th July, 2017) sent by the Union Health Ministry to all Chief Secretaries of States which contains the decision taken by an Inter-Ministerial Committee constituted under Ministry of Health to review the issues raised by IMA. The Committee, in its report, recommended that the Health Ministry shall suggest to all State governments which do not have specific legislation to protect doctors and health professionals to consider one to strictly enforce the provisions of special legislation wherever they exist or enforce the IPC/Cr.PC provisions with vigor. “The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has raised this concern many a time. Since ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects, Government of India, on many occasions has drawn attention of State Governments for an urgent need for a robust criminal justice system with emphasis on prevention and control of crime,” Dr Harsh Vardhan mentioned. A copy of the Draft Act i.e. “The Protection of Medical Service Persons and Medical Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss of Property) Act, 2017 provided by IMA was also circulated to the States vide the 2017 letter. The draft Act includes clauses on penalty and recovery in case of loss/damage to property.

Through his letter to the States, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has reminded the Chief Ministers and requested them to consider enacting specific legislation for protecting doctors and medical professionals, and has forwarded the Draft Act provided by IMA i.e. the Protection of Medical Service Persons and Medical Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss of Property) Act, 2017.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan further said that doctors form an important pillar of society and often work under stressful and difficult conditions. “Our doctors rank among the best in the world and work for long hours under stressful conditions, grappling with a huge load of patients. It is the duty of State to ensure safety and security of doctors who assure that the healthcare needs of the society are met,” he highlighted.

Yesterday, while reviewing the situation, Dr. Harsh Vardhan had met a delegation of Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, United Resident & Doctors Association of India (URDA) and Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA), who gave a representation to him on the violence against doctors in West Bengal. He had assured them his support and cooperation. The Union Health Minister has also written to Ms. Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal yesterday in this matter.

Expressing deep concern, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said, “I strongly condemn the unruly behavior and assault against doctors. I will discuss it with the Chief Minister of Bengal.”  In a letter written to Ms. Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of Bengal, Dr. Harsh Vardhan urged her to ensure an amicable end to the agitation and provide a secure working environment to the doctors. He stated that the ongoing strike is causing severe hardship to the patients across the country and has adversely impacted healthcare services. 

The Union Health Minister further stated that he will discuss the matter of providing safety to hospitals with the Home Ministry and also take up this matter with the Chief Ministers and Health Ministers of other States so that such incidents can be avoided in the future and doctors are provided a safe work environment. “The States should take all possible preventive and deterrent measures, as deemed required so that a peaceful environment prevails and doctors and clinical establishments discharge their duties and professional pursuit without fear or any violence and attacks on them. Together we shall ensure safe and cordial environment for doctors and patients,” he added.

While appealing to the doctors, particularly in the State of West Bengal, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated, “Doctors should resort to other simple and symbolic ways to protest. As medical professionals their duty is towards protecting the rights of their patients. Strike is certainly not the best way to protest. Patients should not be deprived of immediate and emergency healthcare facilities.”

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also urged all patients and their family members to support doctors in performing their duties and professional pursuits in a peaceful and dedicated manner and not to resort to violence. “Doctors are an integral pillar of the society and often work under stressful and difficult conditions. I appeal to all patients and their caregivers to observe restraint”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also appealed to the State governments that all such cases of violence need to be investigated promptly to ensure that criminals get prosecuted in a time bound manner.

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfaremet the Health Minister of Bihar Shri Mangal Pandey at Nirman Bhawan, here today.The two Ministers discussed the reported rise in cases of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) from Muzaffarpur and Japanese Encephalitis (JE) from Gaya in Bihar. Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MOS (HFW) and Ms. Preeti Sudan, Health Secretary were also present during the meeting.  

Dr Harsh Vardhan suggested that there is an urgent need for mounting extensive awareness campaigns, especially in the high case districts, so that the parents, care givers and the community, in general, are sensitized to the need for taking the children for timely treatment to the nearby PHC before the child gets critical.“Timely identification of the symptoms of hypoglycemia shall hugely contribute to timely and effective treatment.The children should be brought to the PHC as soon as thesesymptomsare noticed”, he advised.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also suggestedthat as the cases are from some defined areas in the high load districts, the State should also involve other stakeholders like IMA, NGOs, etc., for widespread awareness and education campaigns. He suggested to actively involve the district administration and to make every Dy. Collector in charge of one tehsil each to actively monitor and ensure that no child reaches a critical condition, and that they are taken to the nearest PHC.  He stressed upon the importance of sturdy mechanisms for monitoring and surveillance.

The Union Health Minister stated that he and senior officers of the Ministry are regularly reviewing the situation and assured all support and assistance to the Health Minister, Bihar in further strengthening the surveillance mechanisms. The multi-disciplinary team from the Centre is stationed there and has been supporting the state governmentinmanagement of these cases. He also suggested that the number of pediatricians in the SKMC hospital be augmented for effectivetreatment of these cases.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also stated thatfood distribution to all children through the ICDS Aganwadi centres and hot meals distribution through NGOs, etc., shall help in boosting the nutrition levels of children in these districts.

                In order to make the Dental Council of India more effective, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the introduction of a Bill to amend the Dentists Act, 1948 (16 of 1948). The decision also gives effect, with certain modifications, to the provisions of the Dentists Act, 1948 with regard to the membership of the Dental Council of India and membership of State and Joint State Dental Councils.

Impact: 

The amendment will help restructure the Dental Councils and the representation of Central Government members and elected members would no longer be made mandatory in the Dental Councils.

In the process it will reduce the redundancy.           

The Bill will be introduced in the upcoming session of Parliament

Details: 

To amend the following clauses of the Dentists Act, 1948:

(i)      Membership of the Dental Council of India under clause (f) of section 3 and

(ii)      Membership of State and Joint State Dental Councils under clause (b) of section 21 and clause (b) of section 23 of the said Act.

Background: 

The representation of dentists registered in Part B as Central Government nominees in the Dental Council of India and the election of four/ two members from Part B to the State / Joint State Dental Councils under the respective clauses in the Act have lost relevance. With a view to reducing the redundancy of the provisions of their representation, the Central Government has decided to delete these provisions so that their representation does not remain mandatory any more.

                Reforms in the field of Medical education so as to give a push to the goal of a quality health coverage to the citizens of India has been one of the major pillars of the NDA Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Keeping the spirit alive and to fulfil yet another promise of the Government, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved theIndian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2019 to replace the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 through an Act of Parliament.  The Bill will be introduced in the ensuing session of the Parliament.

The move will ensure transparency, accountability and quality in the governance of medical education in the country.

Impact:


	The New Bill provides for supersession of MCI for a period of two years w.e.f. 26.09.2018.
	During this period, the Board of Governors shall exercise the powers and functions of MCI as assigned under the IMC Act, 1956. 
	The number of members in the Board of Governors will be increased from existing 7 to 12.


 

Background:

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had come across certain arbitrary action by MCI in disregard to the provisions of the IMC Act, 1956 and regulations made thereunder. Further, the Oversight Committee constituted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to oversee the functioning of MCI had also cited instances of non-compliance of their instructions and subsequently, all members of the Oversight Committee tendered their resignation.

 

In view of these developments, and to put an alternative mechanism in place of MCI so as to bring transparency, accountability and quality in the governance of medical education in the country, it was decided to supersede the MCI through the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 promulgated on 26.09.2018 and entrust its affairs to a Board of Governors (BoG) consisting of eminent doctors. The BoG was constituted under the Chairmanship of Dr. V.K. Paul, Member NITI Aayog and comprising six other members.

 

Legislative Process:

Subsequently, a replacement Bill of the said Ordinance namely, the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2018 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on the 14th December, 2018 and passed on 31st December, 2018 by the House. However, despite all efforts, during the winter session 2018 of Parliament the Bill could not be taken up for consideration and passing in the Rajya Sabha and the House has been adjourned sine die on Wednesday, the 9th January, 2019. Accordingly, it was decided to promulgate a fresh Ordinance namely the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 to allow the BoG appointed in supersession of MCI to continue to exercise the powers of MCI and that of Central Government so that the work already done by the Board of Governors as per the provisions of earlier Ordinance is validated and may continue.

 

The replacement Bill of the Ordinance i.e. the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2018 as passed by the Lok Sabha could not be taken up for consideration and passing in Rajya Sabha during the Budget Session - 2019 of the Parliament, the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 was promulgated on 21.02.2019.

 

The replacement Bill i.e. the Indian. Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2018 pending in the Parliament has lapsed on dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha. Accordingly, the Cabinet has approved the proposal to bring forward a fresh Bill i.e. the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the ensuing session of the Parliament to replace the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2019 through an Act of Parliament.

                “We shall ensure that there are no preventable maternal deaths in the country”. Stressing on the need for safe motherhood, this was stated by Dr.Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare at the high level meeting to review the status of Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Children, Adolescent and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) interventions in the country. “Our Hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has a vision of a New India where children and pregnant women do not die of preventable causes and people are able to realize their full potential in making of a “Swashth Bharat, Sudridh Bharat (Healthy India, Strong India - स्वस्थभारत, सुदृढ़भारत)”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said. We have to work together for bringing all our energies in sync to realise this dream, he added. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhanfurther stated that women are strong pillars of our vibrant society. Together women and children constitute a large part of our population. Sustained development of the country can thus be achieved only if we take holistic care of our women and children. Through our policies and programs, we shall ensure to endpreventable maternal deaths in the country. It is time for all of us to start a mass movement, a ‘Jan Andolan’ to prevent such maternal deaths.“I call upon all the gynecologists and health activists in the country to join hands with the Health Ministry and to strengthen our efforts in this direction”, he said.

He suggested a convergence approach wherein all the resources converge for accelerated outcome supported by an aggressive awareness campaign. “Innovative strategies combined with sturdy monitoring and effective surveillance are needed to ensure that our interventions are effective in achieving the desired outcomes”, he said. Working in a spirit of collaboration, Dr. Harsh Vardhan directed the officials to brainstorm the proposed strategies with gynaecologists, nutritionists, management experts, paediatricians and engage various government departments, the private sector and civil societyincluding members of the community in monitoring progress and collectively addressing the prevailing gaps and challenges. He also suggested that young and upcoming doctors to be roped in for fresh ideas. 

“No child should ever die from Diarrhoea. The government will make immediate and sustained efforts to prevent this by 2022,” Dr. Harsh Vardhan also stated.He said that there is an urgent need to re-strategize our approach and make it more aggressive to achieve the target of zero diarrhoea deaths by 2022. “We have to devise innovative strategies and encourage new ideas and innovations so that we are able to reach the unreached,” he added.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that no child should suffer from vaccine preventable diseases in the country. While Mission Indradhanush and Intensified MI have strengthened the full immunisation coverage in the country, a further aggressive and spirited push is needed to ensure that the dream of the Hon. Prime Minister for full immunisation coverage is achieved, where no child is left without vaccine protection, he stated. “We need to shun the ‘routine approach’ to achieve the targets of full immunization in the stipulated time frame. We have to revamp our strategy and develop a fresh approach. That is the only way we can achieve what we have set ourselves for,” Dr. Harsh Vardhan said.

While reviewing the Anaemia Mukt Bharat, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the programme requires innovative approach and interventionsneed to factor in the regional specificities. “We have to set achievable target by strengthening our strategy along with monitoring mechanisms. We have to generate awareness among people and build partnerships and strengthen convergence between stakeholders to take this programme forward”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated.

                ""There have been no new cases of Nipah virus disease"". This was stated by the Union Minister of Health and Family, Dr Harsh Vardhan who has been regularly reviewing the status of Nipah virus disease in Kerala. He assured the State Health Minister of Kerala, Smt K. K. Shailaja when she called on him yesterday, that the Central Government will continue to extend all support to the Kerala Government for its prevention and management.

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, today expressed deep anguish at the reply of Shri Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Minister of Delhi which was released on social media asserting that Delhi Government shall not implement Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) in Delhi. In a letter written to the Chief Minister of Delhi today, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that the response shows that the Chief Minister is least interested in the welfare of the people of Delhi. He further said that the claim that the Delhi Government is implementing free health care and, therefore, need not implement Ayushman Bharat is baseless. “All your fancy schemes, including the much-touted Universal Coverage Health Scheme, announced more than a year ago, are still lying on the drawing boards awaiting implementation even after four and a half years. Your Mohalla Clinics are an utter flop and the drastic neglect of patient care in Delhi government hospitals is there for all to see,” the Union Health Minister elaborated in his reply.

The Union Health Minister again extended the invitation to the Chief Minister to work together for the larger good of the people of Delhi and the country. “Be part of the historical health sector revolution that has been visualised by our Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji. Ayushman Bharat is the world’s most ambitious and largest free government healthcare program. Let us join hands to celebrate each milestone in the journey towards New India,” Dr Harsh Vardhan has written.

Refuting the statements of the Chief Minister of Delhi further, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that while all States can claim to be providing free health care through government hospitals, in reality, citizens still have to spend a lot from their pocket to get the so-called “free treatment”.“PMJAY targets almost 30 lakh (15% of total population) persons in Delhi who are most poor and vulnerable. You have also mentioned that the income criterion of Rs. 10,000 per month is less than the minimum wages in Delhi but I want to correct you that this criterion of Rs. 10,000 per month was used on data collected in 2011 and therefore, such families which were earning less than Rs. 10,000 per month in 2011 are eligible under the scheme” Dr Harsh Vardhan added. He further said that the families were identified from SECC data based on specific criteria as per conditions existing in 2011 and therefore these families are most vulnerable and need special attention. “You should know that in 2011 minimum wages in Delhi stood at a mere Rs. 6,656 for unskilled workers and Rs. 8,112 for skilled. These eligible families are the most vulnerable ones and therefore, need maximum support”, he added. 

Disproving the claim of Chief Minister on unlimited cover being provided under the “free health scheme of Delhi Government”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that unlimited cover has no meaning if people still have to pay to get the treatment. “PMJAY insurance cover of Rs. 5 lakh per year is good. In 8 months of implementation of PMJAY, only 10 families out of almost 10.74 crore families have exhausted this cover,” the Union Health Minister asserted.

Dr Harsh Vardhan further said that proposed scheme of Delhi Government can be linked with PMJAY for enhanced cover for the poor and vulnerable population of Delhi as they will not only get ready access to private hospitals but will also be able to get benefits across the country. “Since you are anyway providing OPD cover through your proposed scheme, linking with PM-JAY for in-patient cover will be a boon for the poor and vulnerable population of Delhi as they will not only get ready access to private hospitals but will also be able to get benefits across the country. You can even expand PM-JAY to cover more beneficiaries as has been done by many other States”, he added.

Highlighting the salient features of PMJAY, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated “Tertiary care Government facilities are few and overcrowded. This is the reason that almost all the States across the country are implementing PM-JAY and/or in addition to their own health insurance schemes. Under PM-JAY, beneficiaries can directly visit any empanelled private hospital and need not get a referral from public hospital for this. This facility empowers them to choose a health care provider, whereas in the State Government scheme, beneficiaries can visit private hospitals only if they are referred by a public hospital”.

 “Another highlight of PMJAY is that it offers portability and therefore, beneficiaries of this scheme can get benefits across the country, in any of the more than 15,000 empanelled hospitals. Since people often move within the country for various reasons, portability of benefits is very critical. In the proposed State scheme, there is no portability of benefits, so the beneficiary under this scheme is quite vulnerable if he moves out of Delhi,” the Union Health Minister said. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that PMJAY uses state-of-the-art IT system and real-time data available from all public and private empanelled hospitals. The Government gets electronic data of the treatment provided to beneficiaries which is analyzed to ensure that correct treatment is being provided. “Due to availability of electronic data under PM-JAY, states are able to get the real time disease profile and since data comes in real time, early signs of epidemic can be seen from the data and these can be contained quickly. As far as I understand, in the proposed Delhi Government scheme, real time electronic data from both public and private hospitals is not available,” he mentioned.

                “I appeal to all the people of India to make ‘Eat Right’ movement a ‘Jan Andolan’ with ‘Jan Bhagidhari’ just as we all had come together and made India Polio-free. Food is everyone’s responsibility- let us pledge to not waste even one grain of food, and ensure that in our own personal capacities and in our institutions, contribute towards food security. This will help to eliminate poverty, hunger and malnutrition”. This was stated by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare at the first-ever World Food Safety Day being celebrated by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), here today. The theme for this day was ‘food safety, everyone’s business.’ Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare was also present at the event. 

“The New India vision of the Hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji includes health, social security and nutrition. He has acknowledged the ‘Eat Right Movement’ of FSSAI in his “Mann ki Baat” address”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated. Reiterating the importance of this, he said that health is not only absence of disease and infirmity but the presence of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellness. 

Dr.  Harsh Vardhan unveiled a statue of ‘Gandhiji on a Bicycle’ installed at the FSSAI complex. “As we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, the statue symbolizes his journey towards good health and shall constantly inspire people for emulating his good health practices”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated.  He further added that Bapu’s philosophy on food and health is relevant even today. He advocated a simple, whole-foods, plant-based diet, regular fasting and physical exercise for health benefits, which was the inspiration behind the Swasth Bharat Yatra of FSSAI.  

Dr. Harsh Vardhan further stated that people should adopt Gandhiji’s messages of eating less, eating safe and healthy food, and also reducing waste and sharing surplus food. “I request you all to take this pledge in your own local communities to take this message forward. It needs to be used optimally and turned into a Jan Andolan”, the Union Health Minister added.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, congratulated FSSAI and said, “Clean food will result in a clean body, mind and thoughts and deeds. For this people’s awareness about safe and healthy food and participation is critical to make an impact on society.”

At the function, the Union Health Minister felicitated seven leading States/UTs based on the ranking for the year 2018-2019 for their impressive performance. These were Chandigarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. In an effort to galvanize states to work towards ensuring safe food for citizens, FSSAI has developed the first State Food Safety Index (SFSI) to measure the performance of States on five parameters of food safety. The categories included Human Resources and Institutional Arrangements, Compliance, Food Testing- Infrastructure and Surveillance, Training and Capacity Building and Consumer Empowerment. States such as Bihar, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh followed close behind. 

Following the certification of several ‘Clean Street Food Hubs’ in several cities based on third-party audits and training of street food vendors, now Golden Temple Street, Amritsar has been also recognized as a ‘Clean Street Food Hub’.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan launched a new-age, hand-held battery operated device called ‘Raman 1.0’. This device performs rapid detection (in less than 1 minute) of economically driven adulteration in edible oils, fats and ghee. The equipment tests more than 250 samples per battery charge, collects and stores data on the cloud using a smart device. This is the first of 19 such equipment and methods that have been provisionally approved by FSSAI for strengthening the food testing infrastructure in the country.

An innovative solution to take food safety to schools, called the ‘Food Safety Magic Box’ was also launched by Dr. Harsh Vardhan. This do-it-yourself food testing kit comprises a manual and equipment to check for food adulterants, which schoolchildren can use in their classroom laboratories. This kit is also useful for frontline health workers. Twenty kits were distributed to Primary Health Centres and Government schools in Delhi with the support of the Delhi Food Safety Department.

The Health Minister also felicitated the campuses of IIT Gandhinagar, IIT Roorkie, LBSNAA, Mussourie, Unilever, Bengaluru, Wipro, Bengaluru, HCL Noida and Genpact, Gurugram for their exemplary standards. The felicitation was for recognizing the efforts at the community level to promote food safety, FSSAI has declared seven campuses such as those of universities, schools, colleges/institutes, workplaces, defence/paramilitary establishments, hospitals and jails as ‘Eat Right Campus’. 

FSSAI has instituted the ‘Eat Right Awards’ to recognize the contribution of food companies and individuals to empower citizens to choose safe and healthy food options, which would help improve their health and well-being. A commemorative volume to capture the journey and impact of this yatra was also released by the Union Minister of Health as a tribute to all the stakeholders who contributed to make this movement a huge success. 

A Web-resource online Library of FSSAI was also launched. This library hosts informative and interesting videos on topics such as food adulteration, eating a balanced diet, fortified foods etc. This can be accessed at www.fssai.gov.in/videolibrary.

Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), Ms. Rita Teotia, Chairperson (FSSAI), Shri Pawan Agarwal, CEO (FSSAI), Dr Venkatesh, DGHS along with Government food safety officials, Development Partners, and food business operators were also present at the event.

                “There needs to be seamless integration between the two pillars of Ayushman Bharat to ensure that the vision of the Hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji forSwastha Bharat, Samriddh Bharat is fulfilled”. This was stated by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, today as he reviewed the progress of the implementation of Ayushman Bharat including Health & Wellness Centres(HWCs) and Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (PMJAY), here today.“The Prime Minister has envisioned the scheme for the health and wellness of the poorest and most vulnerable of the country’s people”, he said. 

In the meeting, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that there will be zero tolerance for frauds and corruption in any form. “Strong checks and balances should be put in place to deter and mitigate fraud and abuse, and adopt a zero-tolerance policy against any leakages,” he said. He noted that several groups may have been left out of the scheme since the current target group is based on SECC 2011. “We need to work to include those eligible families who have been left out in the survey to make the scheme more inclusive”, he stated.Dr Harsh Vardhan further added that the NHA team should chart out the top priorities that would help further deepen the reach and use of the scheme. “It should be ensured that the scheme reaches every last eligible and needy person in the country,”Dr Harsh Vardhan added.

The Union Health Minister also applauded the progress of the scheme and appreciated the work done in a short period since its launch in September 23, 2019.As part of the review, Dr Harsh Vardhansuggested formation of a task force for discussing probable challenges and find solutions in a time bound manner. He further emphasised that a stronger focus should be given on providing information to all eligible beneficiaries about their eligibility, the benefits and how to seek the benefits. “In addition, efforts should be made to ensure quality of care in the empaneled hospitals. We should try to empanel all quality hospitals for the scheme. Efforts should be made to converge the scheme with the existing central and state schemes,” Dr. Harsh Vardhan elaborated. 

Dr. HarshVardhan also directed them to augment the number of empanelled hospitals under PMJAY, especially in the tier 2 and tier 3 cities along with ensuring that a minimum 2/3rd of top 200 hospitals empanel under PMJAY. 

Out of 36 States/ UTs, 32 have signed MoU with the National Health Authority for implementing PM-JAY and most of these States have started implementation of the scheme. Discussions are in progress with rest of the States - Delhi, Odisha, Telangana, and West Bengal - to bring them on board. In this regard, the Union Health Minister has written to the Chief Ministers of these four states to urge them to implement the scheme in their respective states and bring the benefits of the scheme to the people. Dr, Harsh Vardhanhas assured them of full support to facilitate the States to adopt one single scheme through convergence with the existing state scheme. 

While reviewing the HWCs, the Union Health Minister directed for country wide adoption and replication of best practices undertaken by various state governments. He suggested that there need to be “Jan andolan/social movement ambassadors” at the grassroots level, with good understanding of the system and a passion to work for the country who would then motivate the entire community and work towards integration of health systems at all levels. He emphasised for accelerating the progress on expanding the HWCs in the country, and stressed on maintaining the quality of healthcare services being provided at these Centers. 

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Ms.Preeti Sudan, Secretary(HFW) and Shri InduBhushan, CEO, National Health Authority (NHA) along with other senior officials from the Ministry and National Health Authority (NHA) were present at the review meeting.

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, upon assuming charge of the Health Ministry immediately, wrote a letter to the Chief Ministers of Delhi, Odisha, Telangana, and West Bengal urging them to join the Government of India’s flagship health protection scheme, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY). He then also spoke with Shri Arvind Kejriwal, Shri Naveen Patnaik and Ms. Mamata Banerjee, the respective Chief Ministers of Delhi, Odisha and West Bengal and will also speak to Shri K. Chandrashekar Rao, Chief Minister of Telangana. 

Taking stock of the situation that three States and one Union Territory (UT) are yet to join the Government of India in implementing AB-PMJAY, he said, “It is important that the benefits of the visionary scheme like Ayushman Bharat should reach all deprived and vulnerable people in the country.  I will make all efforts to convince the remaining states and UT to bring the benefits of the scheme to their people and ensure that no eligible person is deprived of these benefits, he stated 

In his letter, the Union Health Minister said that it is due to clear and transparent processes, ease of access and benefits to a large section of the poor population that 32 states and UTs have accepted the scheme. The scheme has been is running successfully providing financial protection to crores of people. Urging them to join the scheme, Dr Harsh Vardhan argued that the states would gain resources, national portability, state-of-the-art technological platforms, implementation systems and world-class analytics systems at no additional cost. They will also benefit from a well-proven fraud monitoring and control system and exchange of key learnings and best practices of other states towards equitable healthcare. The Union Health Minister made it clear that financial resources will be made available to the States with adequate flexibility in the spirit of cooperative federalism. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan pointed out that implementing AB-PMJAY would prove highly beneficial for not just the State but equally importantly to its people and all stakeholders. The ultimate beneficiary of this collaboration will be poor and vulnerable people. Due to the portability of services, the states will gain from the nationwide network of hospitals and will also help provide services in their own state to those from outside their states, he elaborated.

Dr Harsh Vardhan assured full support and cooperation to States in aligning their own schemes with Ayushman Bharat.

Till date 3,56,07,288 E-cards have been issued and 27,28,196 beneficiaries have been admitted in the hospitals under AB-PMJAY.

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare held a high level meeting to review the status of Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP), here today. Ms Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, AS (H), Shri Manoj Jhalani, AS & MD and other senior officers of the Health Ministry were present at the meeting.

Taking stock of the Tuberculosis Control Program, Dr Harsh Vardhan directed the officials for taking up elimination of TB on a ‘Mission Mode’, which would include all stakeholders to come together for an aggressive strategy for TB free India by 2025. “Hon. Prime Minister has given a clarion call to made India free of Tuberculosis by 2025, five years earlier than the global target. Let us develop a comprehensive and focussed high profile strategic action plan by bringing together synergies of all systems and available resources across the government and non-government sectors”, he stated in the meeting.

He further suggested that innovative approaches should be adopted to address TB and directed that eliminating TB should be made into a ‘Jan Andolan’. The Union Health Minister suggested roping in other Ministries, State Governments, MPs, MLAs, NGOs, civil society organisations and media so that sustained efforts are made in combating TB. He further directed the officials to take up new interventions and mount aggressive awareness campaigns so that the whole country is in sync with the ‘TB Harega Desh Jitega’ slogan.

                Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey took charge as the Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare at Nirman Bhawan, here today. He took the Delhi metro to reach the nearest metro station (Udyog Bhavan) from where he then walked down to the Health Ministry to take charge. Before taking charge, he also planted five trees in the Nirman Bhavan campus.

 

Thanking the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Shri Choubey stated that he will carry on with his efforts to implement the mandates of Ayushman Bharat and will now further push for the benefits of Ayushman Bharat to reach the very last mile people; those people who still are unable to access the services provisioned for them through this revolutionary program of the Government. 

 

Speaking on joining the office again, Shri Choubey said that ‘sarve santu niramaya’ i.e. health for all is the policy mandate of the Government and he will make all efforts towards realising the same. He added that Hon’ble Prime Minister has visualised a New India and thus it is our responsibility that we take a pledge to work towards realising this vision of New India, a Healthy India.  Shri Choubey further mentioned that the environment affects our health and hence we should make effort to keep it clean and green, like planting trees and plants, like he did today. He also emphasised that opting for walking and cycling over vehicles for short distances will not only benefit the environment but also keep us healthy. Shri Choubey appealed to everyone towards adopting a healthy habit of brisk walking or cycling for at-least 20-30 minutes each day to maintain good health.

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan took charge as the Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare at Nirman Bhawan, today. He cycled to Nirman Bhawan to take charge and ascribed the act to his ‘green good deed’ for the day.

Thanking the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that health of the people of this country is the top priority of the Modi government. He said that the Government will focus on strengthening promotive and preventive strategies so that people adopt positive and healthy lifestyles and remain healthy. 

Speaking on Ayushman Bharat, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that “we will consider expanding eligibility criteria to include those poor and vulnerable people who have been left out from the current list of PMJAY”. He stated that concerted efforts will be made for empanelling more private hospitals. Also, that the Government will resolve the bottlenecks in the implementation of Ayushman Bharat and make it more handy and easily accessible for the common man. “We will make Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY and Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) into a people’s movement. More than 18,000 HWCs have become functional. The Government will take up the programme to next level with expanded package of services, availability of drugs and point of care diagnostics and tele-medicine facility. The focus will be on consolidating both the streams of Ayushman Bharat, he added. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan emphasised to make health a ‘Jan Andolan’ through people’s involvement. He said that we can provide maximum possible help through this Ministry as there is instant benefit to the people. He further added that India has the potential and capacity for fulfilling the goal of ‘Health for All’.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also laid emphasis on elimination of TB from India by 2025 and said that the government will also take concerted and time-bound actions to eliminate Leprosy and Kala Azar. He added that the government will create a roadmap for essential devices list and a separate policy for medical devices focusing on their accessibility and affordability to masses. “We are committed to leveraging all resources efficiently to ensure that the out-of-pocket expenditure on health is reduced and all citizens can avail of necessary medical services,” Dr. Harsh Vardhan elaborated. 

The Health Minister stated that the government will strengthen the medical education reforms by taking up pending bills like re-organisation of MCI, etc. “The Government will use Mission Indradhanush approaches as part of UIP to ensure full immunization coverage and save all the children and pregnant women from vaccine preventable diseases by 2022, he said. Dr Harsh Vardhan also said that he will request for higher budgetary allocation for health. He further also directed the officials for holding state specific meetings for the States that are lagging behind in IMR and MMR for aggressive progress. He suggested for creating a common working group comprising Health Ministry and the Department of Science & Technology for research and innovation in the health sector by converging the resources and potential of both the Ministries. He said that there is an urgent need to revisit the policies which have been framed many years ago and need changes in tune with the present time. 

He was received by the senior officers of the Ministry. Dr. Harsh Vardhan also held a briefing meeting, in presence of Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, with the senior officers of the Ministry, ICMR, FSSAI, NHA, NCDC and DGHS to review the progress of the work done.

                As per information available in the Public Enterprises Survey 2017-18 that was laid on the Table of both the Houses of Parliament on 27.12.2018, there are 19 operating Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) which have Registered Offices in the State of Karnataka as on 31.3.2018. 

As per the information available with DPE, out of these 19 CPSEs, 3 CPSEs namely HMT Watches Ltd., STCL Ltd. and Tungabhadra Steel Products Ltd.,having Registered Office in the State of Karnataka, have been approved for closure by the Government.

DPE, being a nodal Ministry for all CPSEs, has issued guidelines on 14.6.2018 to all the administrative Ministries/ Departments of CPSEs on time bound closure of sick / loss making CPSEs and disposal of their movable and immovable assets. As per these guidelines, the administrative Ministry / Department / CPSE in consultation with Land Management Agency (LMA) identifies/ undertakes sale/ transfer of land of CPSE under closure. DPE does not centrally maintain data on disposal of land and other assets of CPSEs and amount realized thereof.

DPE coordinated a year-long broad based consultative exercise for redefining the role and functioning of CPSEs in the context of broad Vision of New India 2022 which culminated in the first ever CPSE Conclave held on 9th April, 2018 in New Delhi. The conclave came up with key challenges for the CPSEs to focus on, namely, (i) maximising geo-strategic reach of CPSEs, (ii) minimizing import bill of the country, (iii) Integration of Innovation and Research amongst CPSEs. The CPSEs have prepared their action plans accordingly.

Further, in order to bring in systematic improvement in the functioning of CPSEs, an advisory has been issued by DPE on 16.1.2019 on professionalization of below Board level management in CPSEs.

Director ICAT releasing B-VI certificate for two wheeler category  

International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) released India’s first Type Approval Certificate (TAC) for Bharat Stage - VI (BS – VI) norms for the two wheeler segment in New Delhi today.

The certificate was released and handed over by Director ICAT, Dinesh Tyagi to top officials of the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers).

Speaking on this occasion Dinesh Tyagi said that this is India’s first certification in the two wheeler segment for the BS – VI norms that are the latest emission norms as notified by the Government of India. He said that ICAT has taken many steps in providing assistance and support to the automotive industry for the development, optimization and calibration of engines and vehicles for complying with these upcoming emission norms.

Bharat Stage norms are the automotive emission norms which the automotive manufacturers have to comply to sell their vehicles in India. These norms are applicable to all two wheelers, three wheelers, fourwheelers and construction equipment vehicles.

To curb growing menace of air pollution through the vehicles emission, the Government of India has decided to leapfrog from the exiting BS – IV norms to the BS- VI, thereby skipping the BS – V norms, and to implement the BS – VI norms with effect from 1st April 2020.Only those vehicles will be sold and registered in India from 1st April 2020 onwards,which comply to these norms. The norms are stringent and at par with global standards.

Last year, ICAT issued the approval for BS –VI norms to M/s Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles for the Heavy Commercial Vehicle segment which was also the first in its segment in India.

ICAT is the premier testing and certification agency authorized by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for providing testing and certification services to the vehicle and component manufacturers in India and abroad. It has the latest equipment, facilities and capabilities to develop, validate, test and certify the engines and vehicles for the latest norms in the field of emission and many other facilities like crash lab, NVH lab, EMC lab and test tracks.

                Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister of India, Dr. P K Mishra addressed the closing session of the Annual Conference on Capacity Building of SDRFs, Civil Defence, Home Guard and Fire Services” organised  by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)  here today. Dr. P.K. Mishra, Additional Secretary to the PM of India was the chief guest on the valedictory session.

While addressing the closing session of the Conference, Dr. P K Mishra said that our response system should also stay abreast with the latest technological innovations. Artificial intelligence, sensor technologies, robotics etc. hold huge promise in making our disaster response system more efficient and effective, he added. He also underlined that we have shifted from relief centric approach to response centric approach. 

Following is the full text of the address given by the Additional Principal Secretary to PM, Dr. P K Mishra on the occasion:

Members of NDMA, Director General NDRF, experts from different parts of the country who contributed to the deliberations, officers from different government agencies involved in disaster management, ladies and gentlemen,

It is my privilege to deliver this valedictory address at this very timely and much needed Conference. Although we talk about a paradigm shift from response and relief centric approach to disaster risk reduction, it does not mean that we do not need to continuously improve our response system. Even in the most advanced countries, disaster response is an integral and large part of disaster management.

Having been associated with the conceptualisation of the NDRF, I am delighted to see that since its inception more than ten years ago, NDRF has established itself as a dependable, respected and trusted response force. It has set new benchmarks of timely and effective response. But we must realise that however strong NDRF becomes, it cannot be a substitute for local response capacities. NDRF can be a source of inspiration. It can also guide the capacity development of local response organisations. But it cannot replace them. Therefore, I welcome the focus of this conference on capacity building of SDRF, Civil Defence, Home Guard and Fire Services.

The Disaster Management Act lays down a three-tiered structure – at the national, state and district levels – as far as the disaster management authorities are concerned. But for disaster response, it provides only for the NDRF. However, seeing the need of NDRF like capacities at the state level, NDMA began to advocate setting up State Disaster Response Forces. Today 21 States have SDRF and some are in the process of setting up. The value of SDRF has already been proven in recent disasters such as in Cyclone FANI in Odisha. However, the task of professionalization of SDRF is yet to be accomplished in most of the states. Although each state should develop the SDRF according to its own requirements and available resources, there has to be some degree of standardisation in terms of minimum capacities, skills, tools and equipment in all the SDRFs.

Let me now turn to fire services. Local fire and emergency services are the mainstay of any country’s disaster response system. They respond to not only fires but multiple hazards. While national and disaster response forces are deployed in case of extreme events, the fire services are with the communities day in and day out.  They are an interface between the communities and the government. They save maximum number of lives. I applaud their courage and commitment. Yet they remain woefully understaffed and underequipped in most of our states. We have to upgrade and modernize our fire services, increase their coverage to also include rural areas, and improve their response time to serve communities everywhere. Modernisation has to be done on a continuous basis.  Fire Services have to keep pace with the emerging technologies and practices. 

From my experience in Gujarat I can say that it is indeed possible to modernise the fire services in a relatively short period of time. We trained many firemen and officers in Germany and Holland who in turn became trainers, and trained the other members of the fire service. State-of-the-art equipment were identified through experts and provided to the Municipal fire services free of cost. We provided equipment not only to the fire services in big cities but also to 150 small municipalities. Our resources will always be limited, but investment in fire services has to be an important priority.

The civil defence and home guardsare even closer to communities. But they are largely an underutilised resource for not just disaster response but also for prevention. We should professionalize their capabilities by imparting appropriate training and equipment. We also have to contend with the challenge of retaining and nurturing the spirit of volunteerism, while also discussing about adequate honorarium for the civil defence volunteers. Civil defence as an institution does not exist in all the districts and all the states of India. If we want to actively engage them, then we need to change the role and functions of the Civil Defence and increase their presence to cover all the districts. Civil Defence volunteers can be effectively used for disaster prevention and preparedness by informing, educating and communicating with the communities. They can be used for ushering in a culture of community-based disaster risk reduction. Civil defence volunteers should bethe messengers of long-term risk reduction.

Let me now turn to the issue of coordination. How do we ensure that all of these various response capacities come together in a coherent manner at the local level? In this context, district and state disaster management plans are the key instruments of coordination. These plans, especially at the district level, must define the roles and responsibilities as well as Standard Operating Procedures for all the actors. But this must not remain a paper exercise. We must practice this over and over again so that a multi-agency coordinated response becomes our second nature. That is what mock drills are for. NDMA has a scheme of providing a sum of rupees one lakh for each district every year for conducting mock-drills. All districts must make use of these resources to conduct mock drills and practice coordination. When we practice coordination in peace time, we stay coordinated in times of disasters.

Our response system should also stay abreast with the latest technological innovations. Artificial intelligence, sensor technologies, robotics etc. hold huge promise in making our disaster response system more efficient and effective. There is a need for at least a group of individuals to continuously scan the horizon, anticipate what is coming next on the technology front and ensure that we are future-ready!

Finally, I would like to congratulate all the agencies involved in this conference. The SDRFs, the home guards, the civil defence and the fire services have their distinct identities and comparative advantages. While attempting to build coherence, we must not lose sight of the uniqueness of each one of these arms of our response system. We must nurture their unique strengths.

I would like to especially congratulate NDRF for organising this event. I am sure, this event will be an important step towards strengthening the nation’s disaster response system.

Thank you.

                Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah today exhorted all those working in Disaster response and mitigation sectors to make India number one in this field. 

Addressing the “Annual Conference on Capacity Building of SDRFs, Civil Defence, Home Guard and Fire Services”organised by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) in New Delhi, Shri Amit Shah said the nation came a long way over the last two decades in its response to disasters and improved its capabilities in minimising loss of human lives and damage to economy. He cited the Orissa cyclone in 1999 in which more than 10,000 people had died in comparison to the recent cyclone “Foni” that claimed 64 lives, which reflected the huge capabilities built in Disaster Response mechanisms. But we should not rest till we make ourcountry number one in the world in mitigating and responding to natural disasters, he added.

The Home Minister assured that the Government would provide all necessary resources and equipment to realise this objective and suggested that the personnel in Disaster response forces should be trained to display compassion and commitment at the ground level during rescue and relief operations. 

While cautioning that India is prone to multiple disasters, Shri Amit Shah pointed out that frequent forest fires breaking out in hilly regions is a growing threat which needs to be responded to effectively. 

He directed NDRF, SDRF and other agencies concerned to conduct systematic analysis after each operation to identify possible weaknesses and measures to rectify them. 

The Home Minister exhorted NDRF to coordinate with agencies such as DRDO in order to get the disaster relief equipment manufacturedindigenously.

He urged NDRF to explore enlisting the assistance of PSUs and private enterprises in procuring disaster relief equipment which could be used in rescue and relief operations during disasters in that area. 

Recalling his experience in disaster rescue and relief work at the ground level, Shri Amit Shah asked the officials to lay down clear chain of command for quick and effective response during emergencies.  

Speaking at the event, Minister of State (Home) Shri Nityanand Rai praised the contribution of NDRF and compassion of its personnel displayed in rescue and relief operations during disasters. He recalled that during a flood in Bihar some time ago, a NDRF jawan had not only rescued a boy from a tree top but also saved a snake which took shelter on the tree. He said the Centre was committed to providing all necessary resources so that NDRF could live up to growing expectations.

In his welcome address, Shri S N Pradhan, Director General, NDRF said the Force has saved lives of more than 1,15,000 people in over 2,600 operations. With the addition of four more battalions, the strength of NDRF would go up to 16 by 2020. He said the NDRF is constantly upgrading its capabilities through training, and foundation for  a new training academy in Nagpur would be laid soon.

The event was attended among others by Shri Rajiv Jain, Director IB, Lt Gen (Retd) N.C. Marwah, member NDMA, Shri Kamal Kishore, Member NDMA, Shri Sanjeev Jindal, JS MHA, heads of CAPFs and SDRFs, Home Guards and Fire Services.

                National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) conducted a Multi-State Mock Exercise on earthquake in Delhi (all 11 districts) and the National Capital Region - Haryana (4 districts - Jhajjhar, Faridabad, Gurugram and  Sonipat) and Uttar Pradesh (3 districts - Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad and Meerut) today (June 28, 2019). The exercise was aimed to practise the preparedness and response mechanism of the State Governments to mitigate the impact of a high intensity earthquake. It was conducted in collaboration with the respective State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs). 

Shri Anil Baijal, Lt. Governor of Delhi and Shri Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Minister of Delhi were briefed at the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) of Divisional Commissioner, Delhi. Preparedness activities were reviewed through interaction with the Chief Secretary and senior officials; and a decision was taken to take up certain major initiatives in a time-bound manner. Shri Baijal and Shri Kejriwal requested NDMA to assist the State Government in this regard. Lt. Gen. N. C. Marwah (Retd.), Member, NDMA, assured them requisite support. Later, they all visited Bara Hindu Rao Hospital, one of the sites for the simulation exercise.

Shri Manohar Lal Khattar, Chief Minister of Haryana, reviewed activities at the EOC in Faridabad and witnessed National Disaster Response Force's (NDRF) action in rescue operation. 

The exercise simulated an earthquake measuring 7 on the Richter Scale with its epicentre in Sohna, Haryana. It started with sirens indicating the occurrence of tremors. Everybody ducked under the tables while covering their heads. Once the tremors stopped, evacuation drills were conducted. Soon afterwards, Emergency Operation Centres (EOCs) were activated at the State/ District levels, damage assessed, rescue teams formed under Incident Commanders and dispatched to their respective locations. 

Rescue drills were conducted in coordination with various agencies, such as the Army, Air Force, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs)/ Central Police Organisation (CPO), NDRF, Traffic Police, Fire Fighting department, and Civil Defence. 

""Better coordination among various agencies is of utmost importance and often the key to a successful post-disaster response,"" said Lt. Gen. N. C. Marwah (Retd.). He also emphasised on the need for regularly conducting such exercises in Delhi-NCR as the region falls in the high-risk seismic zone IV and III.

In the debriefing exercise carried out after the drill, participants brought out shortcomings and ways to address them. 

This Exercise is the first in a series of mock exercises on various disasters that will be conducted under the Centre's 100-day Action Plan on disaster preparedness. While an Exercise has been conducted ahead of the upcoming Amarnath ­Yatra, other exercises include a flood and an earthquake preparedness exercise in July in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, respectively. These exercises culminate into a Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) exercise in Tamil Nadu in August.

                During his first visit to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, the Union Home Minister, Shri Amit Shah, held a number of meetings with officials to assess the Security Scenario in the state, review preparations for Amarnath Yatra and provide good governance in the state.  The Union Home Minister, Shri Amit Shah also visited the home of the martyred Inspector of J&K Police, Arshad Khan and consoled his bereaved family today. He handed over an appointment letter to his wife for a job in the State Government. It was for the first time in three decades of terrorism in Kashmir, separatist groups in Jammu and Kashmir  refrained from giving calls for a shutdown on the maiden visit of the Union Home Minister to the Valley.

The Union Home Minister  also interacted with a representative group of Sarpanches from the state to gain an insight into the current state of functioning of Panchayats in the state during his visit.

The meetings in Srinagar were attended by the Governor, Union Home Secretary, all four Advisors, the Chief Secretary and Senior officials of the State and Central Governments, of Security Agencies and the Armed Forces.

The review of development programmes focused on improving the lives of the common man. The review covered a wide range of issues connected with improving the economic condition of the people of Jammu & Kashmir, providing them with employment and livelihood opportunities, providing them the benefit of social security schemes, and raising their incomes. The review included, among others, good governance, accelerating development, strengthening the Panchayat and Municipal system, fast tracking the implementation of the Prime Minister’s  Development Package, building first rate infrastructure, inclusive growth for all communities, balanced regional development with special emphasis on employment generation, and reaching out to the youth.

The Union Home Minister’s focus was primarily on ensuring that the benefits of growth and development reach the poorest of the poor. He asked the State Government to focus on better and more efficient implementation of development schemes so that corruption and leakages are plugged and the citizens to get the intended benefits.

While reviewing the preparations for Amarnath Yatra, the Union Home Minister’s focus was on a safe and smooth conduct of the Yatra. The review focused on the preparations made so far by security forces in this regard, the improvements made in the arrangements as compared to the previous years and any further requirements of security forces. The review also examined the administrative and other arrangements made for ensuring smooth conduct of the Yatra.

In the Security Review, the security agencies gave a detailed briefing on the security scenario in the state, the results of the last one year’s efforts in containing militancy and their future plans. While the improvements in the security scenario were noted and appreciated, there was a detailed discussion on what further improvements could be made for restoring peace normalcy in the state.

            The Home Minister gave directions on a number of issues:


	The State Government should ensure that old age, disability and widow pensions reach all those entitled to these, in a timely manner. There should be a quick scrutiny of all eligible people who are left out and ensuring that they are included. The Central Government will ensure additional funds.
	The dairy and animal husbandry sector has great potential in this state. The State should work towards signing an MOU with Amul or Mother Dairy and create a programme for ensuring that it becomes surplus in this sector. This is a sector whose benefits would flow to even small households.
	The Poultry sector too has great potential with the state importing large volumes of poultry products. The State should create schemes for improving the poultry sector as this sector improves the livelihoods of the poorest. The Central Government would support efforts in this direction.
	The Handloom and Handicraft Sector is one of the brightest spots on J&K’s economic landscape. The potential in this has not been fully captured. The state should take the help of the Khadi & Village Industries, MSME and Textiles departments of the Central Government to improve nearly 40 various spheres in this sector. The growth of this sector would increase employment and livelihoods of poor households.
	The state should ensure that the newly established Panchayati Raj and Urban Local Body systemtakes deep roots and establishes itself as the third tier of government. There should be a drive to ensure that Panchayats and ULBs spend the funds given to them. These funds run into thousands of crores of rupees and ensuring their proper utilization would benefit the people.
	There are many socially disadvantaged groups in the state such as Paharis, Gujars, Bakarwals and other Economically Weaker Sections. The reservation benefits extended to them should be implemented vigorously and no posts in these classes should go vacant.
	The State Government should take steps to ensure that the newly created Anti-Corruption Bureau focuses on cases of rampant corruption by the High and Mighty.
	Women being the key to any development process need to be at the centre of all programmes. The state should work in this direction so that women can get better employment opportunities and livelihoods.
	Similarly, the state should prepare a programme for reaching out to the youth who are highly skilled such as MBBS, Engineers, MBAs etc. and do not have gainful employment or livelihood.
	State Officers should be fully be sensitive towards balanced development of all the three regions, - Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.


During the review of the preparations for the Shri Amarnathji Yatra, the Union Home Minister directed all security agencies to be fully alert and take all preventive steps to ensure violence free Yatra. He directed that:


	There should be no laxity in the enforcement of the SOPs. Senior officers should personally supervise the arrangements at all levels.
	Forces should ensure best possible optimum use of latest technologies and the gadgets not only for the security of the Yatra but also to facilitate the movement of the devotees and the tourists. He specifically drew attention of the Forces towards anti-sabotage as well as anti-subversion drills and the access control procedures.


Appreciating the whole-hearted cooperation of the people of the State in successful conduct of the Yatra, the Union Home Minister reassured his commitment towards best possible arrangements.

After a detailed briefing on the prevailing Security Scenario in the state, the Union Home Minister, while appreciating the significant improvement in all the parameters relating to the security situation, directed that:


	There should be zero tolerance towards terrorism and terrorists.
	There should be continued strict action against terror funding.
	The Rule of Law should be enforced.


The Union Home Minister praised the work of JK Police in countering terrorism and militancy and directed that the State Government should commemorate the martyrdom of its policemen in their hometowns/ villages in an appropriate manner each year. Prominent public places should also be named after martyred policemen.

The Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah further added that he would review periodically the performance of the state on multiple fronts.

• There should be no laxity. Strict enforcement of the SOPs should be ensured. Senior officers should personally supervise the arrangements.

• Forces should ensure best possible optimum use of latest technologies and the gadgets not only for the security of the Yatra but also to facilitate the movement of the devotees and the tourists. He specifically drew attention of the Forces towards anti-sabotage as well as anti-subversion drills and the access control procedures.

• Home Minister underlined the importance of the Standard Operating Procedure for convoy movement and specifically harped on the points that :-

▷ After the cut-off timings barricades should be erected at suitable locations and no differentiation should be made between Yatris and Tourists.

▷ Barricades be used at all lateral entry points during convoy movement.

▷ All lateral points should be manned 24x7.

• Besides attending to medical emergency, preparedness must also be ensured to deal with any type of calamity or contingency. Specialized units and trained personnel should be in place with due focus on the prescribed drills for the purpose.

• Best possible facilities should be provided in the base camps.

• While laying emphasis on the essential facilities for those deputed on the arrangements of the Yatra, he underscored the need for all the duty personnel to ensure proper conduct all throughout.

• There should be no complacency on the part of security forces or duty staff at any point of time during the whole Yatra period.

• Whereas he advised all the security forces and various agencies to continue taking strict action against miscreants, Home Minister also reiterated the need to cover all the sensitive and vulnerable places including possible points of infiltration all throughout the State, in order to obviate any type of risk to the Yatra.

                National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with the State Governments will conduct a Mock Exercise on earthquake preparedness on Friday (June 28, 2019). The exercise aims to improve preparedness and response mechanisms of the local administration in the event of an earthquake. It will cover Delhi (all 11 districts), Haryana (4 districts - Jhajjhar, Faridabad, Gurugram and  Sonipat ) and Uttar Pradesh (3 districts - Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad and Meerut).  

In the run-up to this Mock Exercise, Coordination and Orientation Conferences have been conducted with the States of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana with participation of all stakeholders of States and concerned districts. Prior to the final exercise, a day-long Table Top Exercise is being conducted with all the participants to ensure the smooth facilitation of the exercise. Senior officials from all stakeholder departments such as police, health, education, firefighting, Civil Defense, Public Relations, transport attended these preparatory meetings besides representatives of Army, Air Force, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs)/ Central Police Organisation (CPO).

These exercises are dealing with simulated scenarios of earthquakes and consequent secondary disasters wherein the participants are being trained on key aspects of disaster management such as the formation of Incident Response Teams, activation of Emergency Operation Centres (EOCs), coordination among various participating agencies, rescue and evacuation besides medical preparedness.

The entire National Capital Region falls either in seismic Zone IV or Zone III and is, therefore, highly vulnerable.  This exercise will help in filling gaps, ensuring better communication and improving coordination among various stakeholder agencies. It will also generate awareness among the local population who need to be conscious of vulnerability of the NCR. 

Under the Centre's 100-day Action Plan, several Mock Exercises on different disasters have been planned across the country. This is the first exercise from that series, while an exercise is underway ahead of the upcoming Amarnath ­Yatra, other exercises include a flood and an earthquake preparedness exercise in July in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, respectively. These exercises culminate into a Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) exercise in Tamil Nadu in August.

                Incidents of misuse of social media to commit cyber crimes including online abuse and stalking of women are reported. “Police” and “Public Order” are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.  The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of citizens rests primarily with the respective State Government/ Union Territory. The State Governments/ Union Territories are competent to deal with cases of misuse of social media to commit cyber crimes.              

Ministry of Home Affairs is implementing a scheme namely Cyber Crime Prevention against Women and Children (CCPWC) under which an online cybercrime reporting portal, (www.cybercrime.gov.in) has been launched in September,  2018  to  enable  public  to  report  complaints  pertaining  to  Child 

Pornography/Child Sexual Abuse Material, rape/gang rape imageries or sexually explicit content. The Portal facilitates the States/UTs to view complaints of cyber crime online and take appropriate action. Since inception of the portal, more than 16000 complaints, including other cyber crimes, have been received through this Portal, till 15.06.2019 for action by the States/ UTs concerned.  Steps have also been taken to spread awareness, issue of alerts/advisories, training of law enforcement agencies, improving cyber forensics facilities, etc. These steps help to prevent such cases and speed up investigation. 

This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy in a written reply to question in the Rajya  Sabha today.

                Pursuant to the Government policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, the State Government has taken stringent action to deal with stone pelting, including identification and arrest of stone pelters and instigators of such acts under relevant laws. The number of incidents of stone pelting and miscreants arrested in the state of Jammu and Kashmir during the last three years is as under :-

 


	
		
			
			Year
			
			
			Stone pelting incidents
			
			
			Miscreants 
			
		
		
			
			Arrested
			
			
			Sent to Jail

			2018
			
			
			1,458
			
			
			3,797
			
			
			65
			
		
	


 

The Government has also constituted a Joint Monitoring Committee involving all concerned agencies at the central level and a Multi Disciplinary Terror Monitoring Group (TMG) at the State level for sustained action against terror funding.  This has, inter-alia, resulted in a significant decline in the incidents of stone pelting in 2019 so far, compared to the number of incidents during the corresponding period last year.

                NIA has mandate of investigation of terrorism related cases which are entrusted by Central Government.  In connection with 3 IS related cases, NIA had conducted raids in Kerala (April, 2019) and in Tamil Nadu (June, 2019) and arrested 4 accused. 

Pro-jihadi books, publications besides pamphlets, magazines and posters published by the proscribed organization SIMI and various incriminating documents/literature related to IS have been recovered from arrested persons.

A multi-pronged strategy has been adopted to check the Islamic State (IS) and to bring back the misguided youth on the right path. The measures include socio-economic development of vulnerable communities and focus on educational  empowerment.  As IS  uses  various  internet  based  social media

                Terrorist activities have reduced significantly in the Hinterland of the country.  Similarly, terrorist incidents have reduced in North Eastern States and also in Left Wing Extremism affected areas. In Jammu   &  Kashmir,   security  forces   are   proactively   engaging  with terrorists as per the Government policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism,  resulting in neutralization of large number of terrorists and causalities to Security Forces. The details of the terrorist/insurgent/extremist incidents that have taken place in the country during the last five years, along with number of security personnel / civilians killed are at Annexure.  

 

Close and effective coordination between intelligence and security agencies at the Centre and the State level is being maintained in order to avert terror incidents in the country.  The Multi Agency Centre (MAC) has been strengthened and re-organized to enable it to function on 24x7 basis for real time collation and sharing of intelligence with other Agencies and State Governments.  With a view to enhance the capacity of State forces, the Central Agencies have been organising training programmes for the States forces on intelligence sharing and investigation of terrorism cases.  Many States have raised special forces to deal with terrorism.  Central Armed Police Forces and National Security Guards have also been stationed at different locations to assist the States in dealing with such incidents. 

           

As far as Jammu & Kashmir is concerned, the Government regularly reviews the security situation.  In order to combat activities of terrorists, several steps have been taken including strengthening operational grid, enhancing coordination amongst security agencies, effective retaliation of terror acts, etc.  The Government has implemented a number of measures to mainstream the youth, including providing employment opportunities, sports and cultural activities and youth exchange programme.  Development activities are also being undertaken under Prime Minister Development Package, 2015.

 

As per available information, these two organisations have released a report on human rights violation in Kashmir.  The organisations are known to present a malicious and biased view, while ignoring facts and ground realities in the State.

                ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. State Governments are thus responsible for safety and security of the citizens including women and girls. 

 

However, safety and security of women and children in the country is utmost  priority  for  the  Government. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has been administering various special laws relating to women such as the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005; Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961; Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986; the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. The said Ministry is also administering the Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Act, 2015, the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

The Criminal Law (Amendments), Act 2013 was enacted for effective legal deterrence against sexual offences. Further, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 was enacted to prescribe even more stringent penal provisions including death penalty for rape of a girl below the age of 12 years. The Act also inter-alia mandates completion of investigation and trials within 2 months each. 

 

The Government has also taken a number of initiatives for safety of women and girls, which are given below:

While paying homage, he assured the families of Defence Forces and Central Armed Police Forces that the whole nation stands firmly with the Jawans and appreciates the hardships and sacrifices being made by them. He also thanked Hon’ble Prime Minister, who for the first time after Independence thought about the construction of a Memorial where we can commemorate the sacrifices of our soldiers.

                In keeping with its pro people initiatives and specially for those at the last mile of development, Union Cabinet under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has cleared the decks for approval of ""The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill, 2019"". The Bill will be introduced in both the Houses of Parliament in the forthcoming session of the Parliament.

The Cabinet decision is a reflection of Prime Minister Modi’s vision of a pro people Government committed to SabkaSaath, SabkaVikaas and Sabka Vishwas.

Benefits:

The move will go a long way in providing relief to the persons in Jammu and Kashmir living in areas adjoining international border.

They can now avail reservation in direct recruitment, promotion and admission in different professional courses.

Implications:

The Billwill replace “The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Ordinance,2019” by amendments in the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Act, 2004 and bringing persons residing in the areas adjoining International Border within the ambit of reservation at par with persons living in areas adjoining Actual Line of Control (ALoC).

Background:

The people living in Jammu and Kashmir areas adjoining international border were not included in the ambit of the Jammu and Kashmir reservation Act, 2004 and Rules, 2005. It provides for reservation in direct recruitment, promotions and admission in different professional courses to various categories including residents of Areas adjoining Actual Line of Control. Therefore, they were not getting these benefits for a long time.

Due to continuous cross border tensions, persons living alongside International Border suffer from socio-economic and educational backwardness. Shelling from across the border often compels these residents to move to safer places and is adversely impacting their education as Educational Institutions remain closed for long periods. 

Hence, it was felt justifiable to extend the reservation benefits to persons residing in the areas adjoining International Border on the similar lines of the persons living in areas adjoining Actual Line of Control (ALoC).

During the President's Rule the powers of the State Assembly vest with the Parliament and hence it has been decided to replace the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 with the Bill to be placed in both the Houses of Parliament.

Implications:

The State Assembly, initially kept in suspended animation was dissolved by the Governor on 21.11.2018.

The proclamation issued by the Governor on 20.6.2018 ceased on 19.12.2018 after six months. Under Section 92 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, there is no provision for further continuation of such Proclamation after six months. Hence, on the recommendation of Governor and having regard to the prevailing situation in the State, President issued a proclamation promulgating President's Rule in J&K under article 356 of the Constitution of India. Subsequently, a Resolution approving the subject Proclamation by President was passed in the Lok Sabha on 28.12.2018 and in the RajyaSabha on 3.1.2019.

In this meeting Chief Secretary of Gujarat and Advisor to Administrator of Diu were also connected through Video conferencing and they apprised about preparatory measures put in place for dealing with cyclonic Storm. Gujarat has already evacuated about 1.2 lakhs people from low lying areas to safer places and would complete the evacuation of 3 lakh people by 4 PM today. Similarly Diu has evacuated 8000 people and would complete the evacuation of over 10000 people by 4 PM.

Department of Telecom (DoT) has issued orders to telecom service providers to allow inter-circle roaming without any extra charge.

Ministry of Home Affairs is in continuous touch with the State Governments/UT and the Central Agencies concerned. NDRF has pre-positioned 52 teams equipped with boats, tree-cutters, telecom equipments etc.

Indian Coast Guard, the Navy, Army and Air Force units have also been put on standby and surveillance aircraft and helicopters are carrying out aerial surveillance.

Reviewing the preparedness of the State and Central Agencies, Union Home Secretary directed the concerned officials to take all precautionary measures with a view to ensure that no human life is lost and minimize damage to infrastructure. He also reviewed arrangements for making available essential food, drinking water and medicines in relief camps and to ensure maintenance of all essential services such as Power, Telecommunications, health etc. and that these are restored immediately in the event of damages caused to them.

                The Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964 was issued by the Central Government under Section 3 of The Foreigners Act, 1946. It is applicable to the whole country. Major amendments in the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964 were undertaken in 2013. The last amendment was issued in May, 2019. All these orders are applicable to the whole country and are not specific to any state. Therefore, there is nothing new in this regard in the latest amendment of May 2019.

The May 2019 amendment only lays down the modalities for the Tribunals to decide on appeals made by persons not satisfied with the outcome of claims and objections filed against the NRC.

Since NRC work is going on only in Assam, therefore, the aforementioned Order, issued on 30th May, 2019 is applicable only to Assam as on date for all practical purposes.

This Amendment Order also provides for reference by District Magistrate to the Tribunal for its opinion as to whether the Appellant is a “foreigner” or not within the meaning of the Foreigners Act, 1946.

Since the Foreigners Tribunals under this order have been established only in Assam and in no other state of the country, this amendment in effect is going to be relevant only to Assam at present.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting a basic training programme at the Deendayal  Port Trust in Kandla, Gujarat. The five-day training programme, aimed at increasing the awareness and enhancing the preparedness of Seaport Emergency Handlers (SEHs) to respond to CBRN emergencies at the seaports, started on June 10, 2019. 

This is the fourth in a series of such programmes that will be conducted at various seaports across the country to enable SEHs to respond suitably till the arrival of specialised response teams. Earlier this year, three batches of SEHs were trained at Mangalore, Kochi and Navi Mumbai.

CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) threats emanate at seaports due to arrival, storage and transportation of a large amount of chemical, petrochemical and other CBRN agents. 

The training programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Indian Ports Association (IPA), Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). This training programme will improve the CBRN safety at our seaports by enabling the SEHs to handle any CBRN emergency.

The programme consists of lectures as well as field training, including live demonstrations of detection and decontamination including use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and mock exercises. Besides equipping the SEHs to handle CBRN emergencies, the training programme will also enable them to provide medical first aid and initial psycho-social support. 

Experts from stakeholder departments such as Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will train the participants. 

Around 50 participants representing various agencies responsible for operation and maintenance of the seaport are being trained on various aspects of CBRN emergencies. Another 200 working level staff will be sensitized on the subject in a half-day programme.

                In a crackdown on the unauthorisedoccupants of residential accommodations in public premises, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given a go ahead to introduce ""The Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Amendment Bill, 2019"".

Impact:

The amendments will facilitate smooth and speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from Government residences, and those vacant residences will be available for allotment to eligible persons on maturity of their turn in the waiting list. 

This will decrease the waiting time for availing the facility of residential accommodation.

Implications:

The new bill comes in place of ""The Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Amendment Bill, 2017"".

It will be introduced in the ensuing Session of Parliament. 

Implementation:

The Bill seeks amendments in Section 2, Section 3 and Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971, by inserting clause (fa) before clause (fb) in Section 2, a new section 3B below section 3A of Section 3 and a new sub-section 3A below sub-Section (3) under Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971. 

The proposed amendments would enable the Estate officer to apply summary proceedings for evicting unauthorised occupants from residential accommodations and to levy damage charges for accommodation held during the period of litigation. 

This Bill result in speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from Government residences and increased availability of residential accommodations for eligible persons.

Background:

The Government of India has to evict unauthorized occupants from Government accommodations under the provisions of PPE Act, 1971. However, the eviction proceedings take unusually long time, thereby reducing the availability of Government accommodations to new incumbents.

Under the existing PPE Act,1971 as amended by PPE Amendment Bill, 2015, the eviction proceeding take around 5 to 7 weeks’ time. However, it takes much longer, even years, to evict unauthorized occupants. Under the proposed bill, the state officer will not have to follow elaborate proceedings like serving notice, show cause, inquiry, rather he or she can initiate summary eviction proceedings.

The decision is yet another reflection of the Government’s commitment for a transparent and hassle-free governance for the citizens of the country.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs has stated that in the Swachh Survekshan 2020(SS 2020) league, parameters pertaining to Wastewater treatment &reuse and fecal sludge management have been given special focus.  Launching the SS 2020 League here today , he  said that there will be  a quarterly cleanliness assessment of cities and towns in India.  This will be integrated with Swachh Survekshan 2020, the 5th edition of the annual cleanliness survey of urban India to be conducted from January – February 2020 by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs under the aegis of Swachh Bharat Mission- Urban (SBM-U). Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA, Shri V.K.Jindal, Joint Secretary & Mission Director of SBM(U) besides senior officers of the Ministry were also present at the launch function.  The launch was also attended by the Principal Secretaries, State Mission Directors and Municipal Commissioners of 106 cities with population of 5 lakhs and above who joined the event through+ a video conference. 

Speaking on the need for a quarterly evaluation mechanism, Shri Puri said, “Every year, the Swachh Survekshan is redesigned innovatively, to ensure that the process becomes more and more robust, with focus on sustaining the changed behaviours. However, one concern that was commonly voiced was that cities cleaned themselves up just before a survey and slipped down after that. This year, therefore, we are launching the ‘Continuous Survekshan’ – the SS 2020 League, where cleanliness assessments will happen throughout the year – similar to the continuous assessments that are followed in schools and colleges – and feed into the larger annual survey in January 2020”. SS League 2020 has been introduced with the objective of sustaining the onground performance of cities along with continuous monitoring of service level performance when it comes to cleanliness.

Elaborating on the process of conducting the exercise, Shri DurgaShanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA said, “SS League 2020 will be conducted in 3 quarters, i.e. April- June, July – September and October- December 2019 and will have a weightage of 2000 marks for each quarter to be evaluated on the basis of monthlyupdation of SBM-U online MIS by cities along with citizen’s validation on the 12 service level progress indicators through outbound calls. These two parameters will together determine the quarterly ranking of cities. Ranks will be assigned in two categories, namely, cities with population of one lakh and above and cities with population of less than 1 lakh. The performance of cities in SS League 2020 will be crucial to their ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2020 due to the 25% weightage of the quarterly assessments to be included in the annual survey in January 2020.” The exercise will cover all ULBs that have come into existence on or before 31 December 2018.

As a prelude to encouraging cities to improve urban sanitation, MoHUA had conducted ‘Swachh Survekshan-2016’ survey for the rating of 73 cities in January 2016, followed by ‘Swachh Survekshan-2017’ conducted in January-February 2017 ranking 434 cities. The third round of Swachh Survekshan in 2018 was a quantum leap of scale - conducted across 4,203 cities in 66 days, and became the largest ever Pan India Sanitation Survey in the world, impacting around 40 crore people. The 4th edition covered 4237 cities in a record time of 28 days and was a fully digitized paperless survey. While SS 2016 had seen Mysuru emerge as the cleanest city in India, Indore has retained the title of the Cleanest City in the last three years. Today, the Swachh Survekshan survey has evolved as a powerful and transparent Mission governance and implementation tool, while giving rise to a spirit of healthy competition among states and cities in their race towards becoming ‘Swachh’.

Informing about the achievements of SS 2019, the Minister stated that 84,000 informal waste pickers have been formally integrated into sustainable livelihoods, 4.6 lakh sanitary workers have been provided medical benefits and more than 1 crore citizens have participated in campaigns through Swachh Manch, 18,329 Garbage Vulnerable Points have been transformed and 345 landfill sites have been remediated.  More than 370 cities are practicing segregation at source in more than 80 % of their wards.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Hon’ble Minister of State (I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs will be launching Swachh Survekshan 2020 League at the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), New Delhi on 6 June, 2019. Swachh Survekshan League 2020 will be a quarterly cleanliness assessment of cities and towns in India and will be integrated with Swachh Survekshan 2020, the 5th edition of the annual cleanliness survey of urban India to be conducted between January - February 2020 by MoHUA under the aegis of Swachh Bharat Mission- Urban (SBM-U). 

The objective of the Swachh Survekshan (SS) survey, which is conducted by an independent third party, is to encourage large scale citizen participation, ensure sustainability of initiatives taken towards garbage free and open defecation free cities, provide credible outcomes validated by third party certification, institutionalize existing systems through online processes and create awareness amongst all sections of society about the importance of working together towards making towns and cities a better place to live in.   Additionally, the survey also intends to foster a spirit of healthy competition among towns and cities to improve their service delivery to citizens, towards creating cleaner cities. 

 

The first edition of the annual cleanliness survey, ‘Swachh Survekshan-2016’ survey for the rating of 73 cities was conducted in January 2016, followed by ‘Swachh Survekshan-2017’ conducted in January-February 2017 ranking 434 cities. The third round of Swachh Survekshan in 2018 was a quantum leap of scale - conducted across 4,203 cities in 66 days, and became the largest ever Pan India Sanitation Survey in the world, impacting around 40 crore people. The 4th edition, Swachh Survekshan 2019 covered 4237 cities in a record time of 28 days and was a fully digitized and paperless survey. While SS 2016 had seen Mysuru emerge as the cleanest city in India, Indore has retained the title of the Cleanest City in the last three years.

SS 2019 was not only significantly wider than the earlier editions in terms of scale but has also brought about substantial impact on the ground through a holistic citizen centric engagement. Some of the key highlights of SS 2019 are as follows:


	90,000 residential/ commercial areas inspected
	64 lakhs citizen feedback collected
	18,000 Garbage Vulnerable Points transformed
	84,000 waste pickers integrated into Urban Local Bodies 
	Social media outreach of 4.5 crores
	Participation of 1 crore citizens through Swachh Manch


            Swachh Survekshan League 2020 (SS League 2020) has been introduced with the objective of sustaining the on ground performance of cities along with continuous monitoring of service level performance when it comes to cleanliness.  SS League 2020 will be conducted in 3 quarters, i.e. April- June, July – September and October- December 2019 and will have a weightage of 2000 marks for each quarter to be evaluated on the basis of monthly updation of SBM-U online MIS by cities along with citizen’s validation on the 12 service level progress indicators through outbound calls.

                Pune residents listened to Prime Minister's Mann Ki Baat today, in the company of Union Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change and Information & Broadcasting, Shri Prakash Javadekar. This is the first episode of Mann Ki Baat during the second tenure of Shri Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. The DD News telecast of the programme was shown on a big screen.



While talking to the audience after the programme, the Union Minister emphasized the need for conservation of water, as mentioned by the Prime Minister in Mann Ki Baat.

Prime Minister said in Mann Ki Baat today that “Water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year. You will be surprised that only 8% of the water received from rains in the entire year is harvested in our country. Just and just 8%! Now the time has come to find a solution to this problem. I believe, like the other problems on hand, we can also solve this predicament by the participation of the people, Janbhagidari and their power, Janshakti we are bound to find a solution through the strength, cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore citizens.”



The programme was well-received.

                In a big boost to India-Bangladesh cooperation, the Government of India has decided to show BTV World, a channel owned by Bangladesh TV, on the Doordarshan Free Dish which will be available for the viewers of Doordarshan in our country. At the same time, DD India would be made available in Bangladesh for being viewed by the people in that country. This arrangement is as a result of an MoU signed between Prasar Bharati and Bangladesh TV(BTV) on 7th May, 2019. The channel – BTV World would be of special interest to the viewers of Eastern India. The decision marks an important watershed in the strengthening of ties between the two countries and follows with an earlier decision taken by the two Governments to co-produce a film on Banga Bandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which will be directed by the eminent film Director/Producer Shri Shyam Benegal.

The Government has also approved the proposal of Prasar Bharati for making available the KBS World, an English 24x7 channel of Government of Republic of South Korea on the DD Free Dish for the Indian viewers. Simultaneously, people of Korea would be able to view DD India in their country.

                I&B Ministry has noticed that several dance based reality TV shows portray young children performing dance moves originally done by adults in movies and other popular modes of entertainment. These moves are often suggestive and age-inappropriate. Such acts may also have distressing impact on children, impacting them at a young and impressionable age.

 

All private satellite TV Channels are expected to abide by the provisions contained in Programme & Advertising Codes prescribed under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and rules framed. As per the rules, no programme should be carried on TV which denigrates children, and further that programmes meant for children should not contain any bad language or explicit scenes of violence.

 

The Ministry has accordingly issued an Advisory to all private satellite TV channels to avoid showing children in indecent, suggestive and inappropriate manner in dance reality shows or other such programmes. The channels have been further advised to exercise maximum restraint, sensitivity and caution while showing such  reality shows and programmes.

This practise tends to deprive people versed with Hindi and Regional languages of the valuable information about casting of TV serials/programmes.

To promote #Indian languages we are asking TV channels to also give titles in their programmes in the Indian language in which they broadcast: Union Minister @PrakashJavdekar Read about this: https://t.co/K6Fu7MKTbK … pic.twitter.com/LlhRiZya4e— PIB India (@PIB_India) June 14, 2019

                Union Minister for Jal Shakti Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat today asserted that flow of raw sewage into the river Ganga will be completely stopped by 2022 and the government is working on a Mission Mode to achieve this target. Addressing a National Conference-cum-Exhibition & Awards- “Innovative Water Solutions” here, the Minister said that the States of Uttarakhand and Jharkhand have already achieved this feat and promised to make Ganga fit for holy rituals by this December. He said, everybody from common men to Corporates have to come on board to achieve this mission, as India can’t afford the duality of scarcity of safe drinking water on one hand and wastage of 25 odd litres of water in shower bath. Shri Shekhawat said that he is ready to sit with the Corporates to chalk out a viable strategy for industrial use of water and discharge of untreated industrial waste into the rivers. He also asked ASSOCHAM to find out what portion of CSR funds are being spent on water issues, which he pointed out that it is a meagre 3 percent.

 Shri Shekhwat said that though India is having 18 percent of the world population and an equal percentage of livestock, but our share of water is less than 4 percent and that too is mostly contaminated. He said that everyone should introspect that why India’s rank is 122nd in the World in terms of contamination.

Laying stress that providing piped safe drinking water to every household by 2024 is a stupendous task like cleaning of rivers, the Minister said that these tasks should not be viewed as governmental schemes, rather entire society should come forward in a responsible manner to achieve these goals through “daily audit of actions”.

In his address, President ASSOCHAM, Shri B.K.Goenka said that Water has become a national priority and suggested that the Centre, States and Industry should all work together in a holistic manner to find a scalable, solvable and affordable solution to tide over the problem of water scarcity in India. He said that ASSOCHAM wants to play an important role in this noble mission and can act as a bridge between the Government and the Industry to find out workable solutions.

The Minister also released a EY-ASSOCHAM report titled “Think-Blue” Effective Water Management: Integrating Innovation & Technology.

                Union Minister for Jal Shakti Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat today lamented that 22 kilometers of  Yamuna stretch in Delhi contains more than 90 percent of pollution load and we are sounding helpless to clean the same. Participating in a Cleanathon event of “Namami Gange” at the Kalindi Kunj Ghat near Okhla Barrage this morning, the Minister said that when Prime Minister took a broom in his hand, while launching the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2nd October, 2014, it became a mass movement and access to toilets became from 39 percent in 2014 to 99 percent in 2019. Similarly, under his leadership the cleaning of river Ganga and its tributaries would be taken up in a mission mode. Today, Cleanathon under Namami Gange was carried out at 8 Ghats in Delhi.

Shri Shekhaewat said that Government could only be a catalyst, but to realise the dream and vision of Prime Minister- “Aviral Dhara”, “Nirmal Dhara” and “Swachh Kinara”, the Cleanathon project should truly become a mass movement. He said that the Government is working on the project by adopting the Basin Approach, which is more sustainable.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Jal Shakti Shri Rattan Lal Kataria said that Government is well aware of its responsibilities towards cleaning of rivers and he is happy that slowly this is also taking the shape of a mass movement like the Swachh Bharat Mission. He said, apart from Ganga, Yamuna, Kali Bhagirathi, Alaknanda and Koshi will be brought under the Cleanathon Project.

Secretary, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri U.P. Singh said that a river is river which must flow, but sadly this is not true for Yamuna. He also said that community engagement is must for taking Yamuna to its past pristine glory. He also lamented that people of Delhi had so far not felt Yamuna as one of their own heritages, and hence the plight of the river.

Earlier, a committee found in a report that ""Although the Yamuna river flows only for 54 kilometres from Palla to Badarpur through Delhi, the 22-km stretch from Wazirabad to Okhla, which is less than 2 per cent of the river length of 1370 kilometres from Yamunotri to Prayagraj, accounts for about 76 per cent of the pollution level in the river"". This 2 per cent stretch from Wazirabad to Okhla sees maximum discharge of untreated industrial and domestic wastes.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Jal Shakti, Shri Rattan Lal Kataria said that in India states like Assam and North Bihar face floods every year, but with the arrival of new technology, CWC could be able to do flood forecasting 3 to 4 days in advance. He said, due to faulty planning, many of our cities face the problem of water-logging during Monsoon and appealed that local bodies should work in coordination with Central agencies to tide over this challenge.

                Minister of Jal Shakti, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, today stressed the need to launch a huge jan andolan for water conservation along lines of the Swachh Bharat Mission to address agricultural, industrial and domestic water issues.  

The Minister said, “Years before today, nobody would have believed that the sanitation coverage of India would reach the 100% mark by 2019. Today, in just 4 and a half years since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission, this figure has increased from 39% to 99%.  I express my gratitude to all of you who have contributed to this jan andolan and have made India a role model for the rest of the world.”

The Minister said that the challenge of providing water to 17% of the world’s population (which lives in India) with just 4% of water in the world available with us, is the next big challenge facing the country. He added that he was confident that, with the PM’s vision and the people’s support, this Mission too can be accomplished.

The Minister was speaking at the launch of the Swachh Mahotsav 2019 - a campaign to celebrate the successes of the Swachh Bharat Mission and honour the stakeholder who were instrumental in making it happen. Kickstarting the Mahotsav, winners of Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya were recognized by the Minister in the Capital today. The Mahotsav is being organized by the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti and will culminate on 2nd October 2019, the 150th birth year anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

The Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya contest was aimed at sustained usage of toilets by encouraging pride in the toilet by the household. From January 1 to 31, 2019, more than 1.34 crore toilets were painted, decorated and given a facelift by the people of India under the campaign. The best performing States, Districts and individuals were awarded for making the campaign successful today. 

Speaking at the event, the Secretary, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Shri Parameswaran Iyer,mentioned that over 20,000 awards would be given to acknowledge the contributions of people from different walks of life under the Swachh Mahotsav campaign. He added that the campaign would be marked by immense information, education and communication activities at district, state and the national level in order to celebrate Swachhata.

The event witnessed the launch of Swachh Mahotsav logo and a book by the Minister. A book, ‘Showcasing Swachh Bharat Mission:When print media told the Swachh Bharat Story’ was launched. The book is a compilation of media coverage of the major milestones of the Swachh Bharat Missionsince 2014. The event was attended by State Secretaries, Mission Directors, District Collectors, Sarpanches, Swachhagrahis and the winners of the Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya Contest.

                Union Minister for Jal Shakti Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat today said that India is one of the most vulnerable country in terms of water availability and population explosion has added more to the problem. Speaking at the Pre-Golden Jubilee Celebrations at ChhathGhat, ITO, New Delhi, he said that every drop of water should be saved and conserved and all should make a combined effort for judicious use of water on a continuous mode.

Shri Shekhawat said that India had achieved the distinction of a food exporting country from being a food deficient nation, but scarcity of water in near future can worsen the situation and hence there is need for revival of traditional water bodies and more vigorous effort should be made for water conservation.

Complimenting WAPCOS, Shri Shekhawat said that that the organization had not only taken path breaking developmental activities, but also came forward in a big way to take up challenging social issues. He said, from conceptualization to completion is the motto of WAPCOS.

Minister of State for Jal Shakti Shri Rattan Lal Kataria said that like Swachh Bharat Mission launched on 2nd October 2014, which became a people’s movement, piped water scheme will also achieve the same success as Prime Minister is fully committed to achieve this goal.

Speaking on the occasion, CMD, WAPCOS, Shri R.K.Gupta said that WAPOCOS is a leading technology driven consultancy and EPC organization with strong global presence in the fields of water, Power and Infrastructure Sectors. WAPCOS has successfully completed/on-going consultancy assignments in countries covering Asia, Africa, Middle East, South America and Pacific Island and is operating in more than 47 Countries, at present. 

Later on, the Union Ministers and Secretary, Shri U.P.Singh were joined by hundreds of volunteers, NGO members, common men and employees of WAPCOS in cleaning four Ghats-ChhathGhat,ShyamGhat, QudeisaGhat and YamneshwarGhat at Yamuna bed and plantation of trees to match the motto of WAPCOS- “Our River, Our Future” and “Plant Tree, save life”.

                Union Minister for Jal Shakti, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat reviewed the ongoing Namami Gange projects in Varanasi during his visit to the city today. He inspected the 140 Million Litres Day (MLD) Dinapur Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) from inlet upto outfall point into Varuna. He was accompanied by Director General, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra. 

Union Minister, Sh. Shekhawat instructed the officials of Dinapur STP to conduct periodic chemical checks to ensure that the sewage does not have any industrial or other toxic discharge. Under the Namami Gange program, 2 STPs at Dinapur and Goitha (120 MLD) have been recently completed at Varanasi, of which, the Dinapur STP was inaugurated late last year by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in November 2018.

Furthermore, the 50 MLD STP being constructed in Ramana will bolster the existing sewage treatment capacity of the city and take it to 412 MLD which is adequate to meet the sewage treatment demand till 2035 and stop untreated sewage from entering the Ganga in Varanasi.

Shri Shekhawat also inspected all the 84 iconic Ghats of Varanasi by boat with a particular focus on the 26 Ghats, where the projects of repair/ renovation have been taken up under the Namami Gange Program. He also reviewed the project for regular cleaning of the 84 Ghats as well as the river surface cleaning project, both of which have been put in place under the Namami Gange Program to ensure cleanliness in and around the river.

Apart from inspecting the Ghats, he also observed the Ghat pumping stations and tapping of drains. Out of 23 drains, 20 drains have already been tapped. The remaining 3, including Assi are being tapped through Ramana STP project, which is to be completed during this year. 

The Minister also visited ‘Ganga Tarini’, a floating museum on a house boat which showcases a film display on Ganga and its rich biodiversity. It is a first of its kind initiative to inform people about the various facets of the river including the social, cultural, historical and economical aspects. Ganga Tarini has been developed by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in collaboration with NMCG. 

Shri Shekhawat also visited ‘Jalaj’, a boat which moves along the Ghats of Varanasi and the nearby villages, displaying and selling products prepared by the Ganga Praharis and local villagers, as a boost to better livelihood opportunities for people living along the banks of the Ganga. The trained Ganga Praharis also educate the local people and tourists regarding Ganga river, biodiversity and cleanliness.

                The Union Minister for Jal Shakti, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, held a review meeting with all State Ministers and State Principal Secretaries for Water Resources, Drinking Water and Sanitation and PHED in New Delhi today. The focus of the meeting was to review the steps taken and action plans made by various States for the drinking water and sanitation sectors in the country, especially their preparedness to conserve rainwater over the forthcoming monsoon months. 24 State Water and Sanitation Ministers joined the meeting to represent the sectors in their respective States. 

Water conservation and rural drinking water

The Minister reviewed the initiatives taken by the States to address the current water situation in the country along with the implementation of action plans to conserve water during the upcoming monsoon season. He urged that Centre and States should work in the spirit of co-operative federalism as guided by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. Further, he added that the newly created Jal Shakti Ministry will take forward the management of demand and supply of water under a single umbrella. He stressed that rational water use and recycling of water should be made a Jan Andolan, much like the Swachh Bharat Mission did for sanitation. He also requested the States to plan water harvesting and conservation in convergence with other programmes. In this context, he referred to the letter recently written by the Prime Minister to all sarpanches of the country, calling upon them to take up water conservation activities. He emphasized the importance of creating awareness among the masses on the need to conserve water.

Secretary (Drinking Water and Sanitation), Shri Parameswaran Iyer, said that it was for the first time that an integrated approach to Water is being adopted at the Central level. He mentioned that many of the attending Ministers had personally appreciated the speed with which the new Minister had convened a meeting with State Water Ministers at such a large scale, so early into his tenure.

He added that the Ministry is working on a new water supply programme to provide drinking water connections to rural households, and that such a programme can only be successful if various water conservation efforts, like point recharge, de-silting of minor irrigation tanks, use of grey water for agriculture are integrated and sustainability of the sources is ensured.            

Secretary (Water Resources), Shri U P Singh, spoke about the overall water resources availability and the current issues faced due to water scarcity. He emphasized the need for demand management of water, specifically in agriculture by use of micro irrigation, and re-use of treated water. He urged all the State Governments to adopt an integrated approach to Water Resource Management by integrating efforts across different Departments involved in water at the State level.

Swachh Bharat Mission – Grameen (SBM-G)

With SBM-G in the last stage of implementation towards building an Open Defecation Free (ODF) India, the Minister set the agenda to achieve 100% sanitation coverage for all rural households at the earliest. He stressed that a Clean India is not a goal but a continuous process, adding that the Mission takes pride in having changed the sanitation behaviour of over 55 crore people. He also assured the States that there will continued support to sustain behaviour change. 

Secretary (Drinking Water and Sanitation), Shri Parameswaran Iyer, spoke about the importance of developing mechanisms to sustain the SBM-G outcomes and stressed on the need for solid and liquid waste management in rural areas, taking India from ODF to ODF-plus. He stressed on the continuity of aspects such as communication, both IPC and Mass media, strengthening institutions and capacity building. 

All State Ministers present at the meeting shared their State’s progress in sanitation and the future plans for post-ODF activities as well as water conservation and drinking water supply.

                Child Labour is an outcome of various social-economic problems such as poverty, economic backwardness and illiteracy.  Government is following a holistic and multi-pronged strategy for elimination of child labour completely. 

The Government has amended the Child Labour (Prohibition  & Regulation) Act, 1986 and enacted Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which inter-alia covers complete prohibition on employment or work of children below 14 years of age in all occupations and processes; linking the age of the prohibition of employment with the age for free and compulsory education under Right to Education Act, 2009; prohibition on employment of adolescents ( 14 to 18 years of age) in hazardous occupations or processes and making stricter punishment for the employers contravening the provisions of the Act.

Subsequent to the amendment in Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986, Government has framed Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2017.

The Government is also implementing the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme for rehabilitation of child labour. Under the NCLP Scheme, children in the age group of 9-14 years are rescued/withdrawn from work and enrolled in the NCLP Special Training Centres, where they are provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid day meal, stipend, health care, etc. before being mainstreamed into formal education system. Children in the age group of 5-8 years are directly linked to the formal education system through a close coordination with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).

As per the information received from State Governments the number of child labourers who were rescued/withdrawn from work, rehabilitated and mainstreamed under National Child Labour Project Scheme during the last three years, State-wise is given in the table below-

                The Government of India has taken a historic decision to reduce the rate ofcontribution under the ESI Act from 6.5% to 4%(employers’ contribution beingreduced from 4.75% to 3.25% and employees’ contribution beingreducedfrom 1.75% to 0.75%). Reduced rates will be effective from 01.07.2019.Thiswould benefit 3.6 crore employees and 12.85 lakhemployers.

The reduced rate of contribution will bring about a substantial relief to workers and it will facilitate further enrollment of workers under the ESI scheme and bring more and more workforce into the formal sector. Similarly, reduction in the share of contribution of employers will reduce the financial liability of the establishments leading to improved viability of these establishments. This shall also lead to enhanced Ease of Doing Business. It is also expected that reduction in rate of ESI contribution shall lead to improved compliance oflaw.

The Employees’ State Insurance Act 1948 (the ESI Act) provides for medical, cash, maternity, disability and dependent benefits to the Insured Persons under the Act. The ESI Act is administered by Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC). Benefits provided under the ESI Act are funded by the contributions made by the employers and the employees.

Under the ESI Act, employers and employees both contribute their shares respectively. The Government of India through Ministry of Labour and Employment decides the rate of contribution under the ESI Act. Presently, the rate of contribution is fixed at 6.5% of the wages with employers’ share being 4.75% and employees’ share being 1.75%. This rate is in vogue since01.01.1997.

The Government of India in its pursuit of expanding the Social Security Coverage to more and more people started a programme of special registration of employers and employees from December, 2016 to June, 2017 and also decided to extend the coverage of the scheme to all the districts in the country in a phased manner. The wage ceiling of coverage was also enhanced from Rs. 15,000/- per month to Rs. 21,000/- from01.01.2017.

These efforts resulted insubstantial increase in the number of registeredemployees i.e. Insured Persons and employersand also a quantum jump in therevenue income of the ESIC.The figures are as under: -

                On the day of World Day against Child Labour on June 12, 2019 the Ministry of Labour and Employment and V.V. Giri National Labour Institute in collaboration with the International Labour Organization, New Delhi organised a ‘Technical Consultation on Evolving Strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal, Target 8.7 and Elimination of Child Labour in India’. 

 

The Theme of World Day against Child Labour for the year 2019 is ‘Children shouldn’t Work in Fields, but on Dreams’ which focuses on the importance of ending child labour and calls for evolving strategies to end child labour. 

 

Shri Heeralal Samariya, Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, in his inaugural address said that government is adopting a multi prong strategy to combat the problem of Child Labour and emphasized on the importance of implementation of the various acts and rules to eliminate the child labour.  He said the ideal place for a child is school and not work. The secretary further said that government has enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force with effect from September 01, 2016. Now the employment of a Child below 14 years is completely prohibited in any occupation or processes. The Amendment prohibits the employment of adolescent (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations and processes. He further said that census 2011 shows decline in Child Labour which has come down to 1.01 crore as compared to 1.26 crore in 2001. 

 

The Song on the Elimination of Child Labour, developed by the ILO and the Video-clip on the Elimination of Child Labour developed by the Child Labour Division, Ministry of Labour and Employment were launched on this occasion, apart from quarterly newsletter ‘Child Hope’ of VVGNLI.

 

Dr. Dagmar Walter, Director of ILO, New Delhi appreciated the efforts taken by the Government of India in ratifying the ILO Conventions 182 and 138. ILO Convention No. 138 inter-alia prescribes that there should be a minimum age of entry to employment which should not be less than age of compulsory education or 15 years (relaxable to 14 years in the case of developing countries). ILO Convention 182 inter-alia, mentions the minimum age for working in hazardous occupations as 18 years. As on date, 167 countries across the world have ratified ILO Convention 138 and 179 countries have ratified ILO Convention 182.    

 

Ms. Kalpana Rajsinghot, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment discussed about the various policy initiatives and schemes introduced by the Government of India, towards elimination of child labour. She said that National Child Labour Project (NCLP) aims to eliminate all forms of child labour through identification and preparing children withdrawn from work for main stream education along with vocational training. An online portal, PENCIL, was launched on 26.09.2017 for better monitoring & reporting system to ensure effective implementation of the provisions of the amended Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 and National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme. All operational Project Societies of NCLP are registered on the portal for better implementation of NCLP scheme aimed at educational rehabilitation of child and adolescent labour.

 

Dr. H. Srinivas, Director General in his welcome address set the tone for the Technical Consultation by highlighting that though poverty has been one of the important factors of the cause of child labour, change in the mindset and attitude of the society towards this problem, could go a long way in ameliorating the problem. 

 

During the Technical Session, Shri Insaf Nizam, Child Specialist, ILO and Dr. Helen Sekar, Senior Fellow, V. V. Giri National Labour Institute shared various technicalities of the child labour problem.

                ‘SabkaSaath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’ has been the pivot of NDA government lead by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.  Fulfilling one of the promises to the people, the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 by replacing the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Second Ordinance, 2019 (Ord.4 of 2019).

Impact:

The Bill would ensure gender equality and  gender justice to Muslim women. The Bill would also help in protecting the rights of married Muslim women and prevent divorce by practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by their husbands.  The Bill will be introduced in the forthcoming session of the Parliament.

Implications:


	The Bill propose to declare the practice of triple talaq as void and illegal. 
	It also makes an offence punishable with imprisonment up to three years and fine.
	It also provides for payment of subsistence allowance to married Muslim women and dependent children.
	The Bill also proposes to make the offence cognizable, if information relating to the commission of an offence is given to an officer in charge of a police station by the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced or by any person related to her by blood or marriage.  
	The offence is made compoundable with the permission of the Magistrate at the instance of the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced.  
	The Bill further provides for hearing the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced, before the accused is released on bail by the Magistrate.


The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 is on similar lines of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Second Ordinance, 2019.

                Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)  and Road Transport & Highways,  inaugurated the MSME Day 2019 celebrations and the second International SME Convention in New Delhi today. Speaking on the occasion he said that  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's dream of making India a 5 Trillion Dollar economy can only be fulfilled by ensuring the growth of the MSME sector in the county. He said that in the coming years it will be his endeavour to raise the contribution of MSME sector to the country's GDP to 50 percent from the present 29 percent, and ensure that it gave employment to at least 15 Crore people against the 11.1 Crore at present.

Emphasizing the Government's  committment towards creating an enabling environment for the growth of the sector,  Shri Gadkari  said there is an urgent need to encourage  research and innovation in the sector, collaborate with global entities to bring in the latest  technology and best practices and also promote  marketing. For this he has proposed creating a new website where people can post new ideas, suggestions and innovations. This will help develop a bank of innovation and ideas where all stake holders can share their suggestions, technologies etc.  

Minister also said there are   plans to develop a portal for creating a market place like Alibaba where all stakeholders can find the demand and supply inputs.

Shri Gadkari lay emphasis on the need to diversify in new MSME potential sectors especially in the rural and agricultural sectors. He said  the International SME convention can play a crucial role as it is a great platform for discussing and sharing the best practices for enterprise development. 

Also speaking on the occasion Shri Pratap Chandra Sarangi, MoS MSME and Animal Husbandry, Dairy and Fisheries said that it is very heartening to note that  so many Indians are now involved in their own enterprises and are in positions to provide employment to people.

Speaking earlier Secretary MSME Shri Arun Kumar Panda said the MSME sector is the backbone of the country's economy. He said the sector is changing very fast . With the coming of  GST, many micro and small enterprises have come into the fold of the firmal economy, which is a very good sign.

                Union Minority Affairs Minister Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi inaugurated a two days ‘orientation-cum-training programme’ for Haj 2019 deputationists in New Delhi Today. He said that the Centre Government has ended “deceit of Haj subsidy” with decisive honesty and transparency and for the first time since Independence, a record number of 2 lakh Indian Muslims will go to Haj this year without any subsidy. 

 

While inaugurating a two-day orientation-cum-training programme for Haj 2019 deputationists in New Delhi today, Shri Naqvi said that this honest and transparent system has ensured that even after removal of Haj subsidy; there is no unnecessary financial burden on the Haj pilgrims. 

 

Union Minority Affairs Minister said that the Central Government has taken effective steps to ensure safety and better facilities of Haj pilgrims and emphasised that no negligence will be tolerated in this regard. 

 

Shri Naqvi added that a total of 620 Haj coordinators, Assistant Haj Officers, Haj Assistants, Doctors, Paramedics etc. have been deployed in Saudi Arabia to assist the Haj pilgrims. These deputationists include a large number of women.  

 

Minority Affairs Minister said that a record number of 2 lakh Indian Muslims will go to Haj this year, that too without any subsidy, through more than 500 flights from 21 embarkation points across the country. While 1 lakh 40 thousand Haj pilgrims will go through Haj Committee of India, 60 thousand Haj pilgrims will go through Haj Group Organisers (HGOs). All the HGOs will have to take 10 thousand Haj pilgrims on the rates decided by Haj Committee of India only.  

 

To ensure transparency and convenience to the Haj pilgrims, Shri Naqvi informed that this year a portal of HGOs- http://haj.nic.in/pto/ (Portal For Haj Group Organisers) has been developed containing all the details of HGOs, their packages  etc. A total of 725 HGOs will take Haj pilgrims this year.

 

He said that the number of women Haj pilgrims going without “Mehram” (male companion) this year is double in comparison to last year. 2,340 Muslim women from India will go for Haj without “Mehram” this year while 1180 women had performed Haj last year without “Mehram”. This year too, the Minority Affairs Ministry has made arrangement to send these women on Haj without lottery system. 2 lakh Indian Haj pilgrims include about 48 per cent women. 

 

Flights for Haj 2019 will start from 04th July 2019. On 04th July, flights will start from Delhi, Gaya, Guwahati and Srinagar. Besides, Haj pilgrims will go from Bengaluru (07th July), Calicut (07th July), Cochin (14th July), Goa (13th July), Mangalore (17th July), Mumbai (14th and 21st July), Srinagar (21st July). In the second phase, flights will go from Ahmedabad (20th July), Aurangabad (22nd July), Bhopal (21st July), Chennai (31st July), Hyderabad (26th July), Jaipur (20th July), Kolkata (25th July), Lucknow (20th July), Nagpur (25th July), Ranchi (21st July) and Varanasi (29th July). 

 

Shri Naqvi said that Saudi Arabia’s decision to increase India’s Haj quota to 2 lakh has ensured that for the first time since Independence, all the Haj applicants from all big states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar will go to Haj 2019 as their waiting lists have been cleared due to increase in Haj quota.

 

A total of 19 health centres (16 in Makkah and 3 in Madina) have been established. Besides, 3 hospitals in Makkah and 1 hospital in Madina have been established to ensure proper health facilities to Haj pilgrims. In the two-day training programme, Haj deputationists will be given all the information about Haj pilgrimage, accommodation in Makkah and Madina, transport, health facilities, safety measures etc.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today chaired meeting of Central Waqf Council in New Delhi. Shri Naqvi said that a programme on war footing has been launched for 100 per cent Geo tagging and digitalisation of Waqf properties across the country to ensure these properties can be utilised for welfare of the society. 

While chairing 80th meeting of Central Waqf Council (CWC), Union Minister said that Geo Tagging and Digitalisation will ensure transparency and safety of Waqf records. For the first time since Independence, Government has decided to provide 100 per cent funding to develop schools, colleges, ITIs, polytechnics, hospitals, multi-purpose community hall “Sadbhav Mandap” on Waqf land under Pradhanmantri Jan Vikas Karykram (PMJVK). 

Shri Naqvi said that the Centre has decided to start a programme on war footing to utilise Waqf properties across the country for educational empowerment and employment oriented skill development of the needy especially economically backward girls in those areas of the country which were deprived of these facilities since the Independence.

The Centre has been developing schools, colleges, ITIs, skill development centres, multi-purpose community centres “Sadbhav Mandap”, “Hunar Hub”, hospitals, business centres, common service centres etc. on large scale on Waqf properties across the country.

The Minister said that while only 90 districts of the country had been identified for Minority communities’ development during the earlier Central Government; present Government has expanded development programmes for Minorities in 308 districts of the country. There are around 5.77 lakh registered Waqf properties across the country. Geo Tagging and digitalisation will ensure transparency and safety of Waqf records. 

Shri Naqvi said that the report of a five-member committee, constituted to review Waqf properties lease rule, headed by Justice (Retd) Zakiullah Khan, has been submitted. The recommendations of the committee will ensure that Waqf rules are made easy and effective for better utilisation of Waqf properties and to free these properties, several of these entangled in disputes for several decades, from disputes.  The Central Government is taking necessary action on the recommendations of the committee. 

Union Ministersaid that Central Waqf Council is providing financial help to state Waqf boards for digitalisation of Waqf records so that state Waqf boards can complete digitalisation work within decided timeframe. 

GIS/GPS maping of the Waqf properties has been initiated with the help of IIT Roorki and Aligarh Muslim University. The Central Waqf Council has provided video conferencing facilities to 20 state Waqf boards and it would be provided in the remaining state Waqf boards by the end of this year.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi chaired meeting of officials of Minority Affairs Ministry at Antyodaya Bhawan in New Delhi today. Shri Naqvi emphasised that to accelerate the “vehicle of development” on the “highway of trust” will be our priority in the next five years to ensure “happiness in eyes and prosperity in life” of every needy.

Minister of Minority Affairs said that we have to remain alert and cautious to ensure that there is no “speed breaker” or any obstacle comes on this “highway of trust”.

Shri Naqvi said that our target is to provide “Pradhanmantri Scholarship” to 5 crore students in the next five years, which will include 50 per cent girl students. The entire process of “Pradhanmatri Scholarship” has been made easier and transparent through DBT mode.

Union Minister of State for Minority Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju was also present in the meeting.

Shri Naqvi added that ensuring socio-economic-educational empowerment of Minorities through “3E”- Education, Employment and Empowerment is our target and we will work hard to achieve this goal.

The Minister also said that “Padho-Badho” campaign will be launched across the country to encourage education of Minority girls. Educational infrastructure will be developed on war footing in those areas of the country where people don’t send their daughters to schools due to socio-economic reasons. 

 

He added that 100 “Hunar Haat” will be organised across the country to provide market and employment opportunities to master artisans. A system will also be developed to provide online platform to master artisans to sell their hand-made “Swadeshi” (indigenous) products.

Shri Naqvi further said that employment oriented skill development schemes such as “Seekho aur Kamao”, “Nai Manzil”, “Garib Nawaz Skill Development”, “Ustaad” will be made more effective to ensure skill development of 25 lakh youths in the next five years.

The Minister also stated that an awareness campaign will be launched across the country to make the people aware of various educational and skill development schemes of the Central Government through 100 vans. Cultural programmes, street play, short films will be part of this awareness campaign.

Union Minority Affairs Minister Shri Naqvi said that “Pragati Panchayat” will be organised across the country where he will be present with senior officials of the Minority Affairs Ministry and officials of the state government concerned. The Ministry of Minority Affairs has developed “people friendly” 100 per cent online system to ensure transparency in all the welfare schemes. This online system has eliminated the role of middlemen. 

The Minister said that soon zonal coordination meetings will be organised in Mumbai, Ranchi, Lucknow, Kerala where senior officials of the Minority Affairs Ministry and Ministers and senior officials of various state governments will take stock of the effective implementation of welfare schemes.

                In a major decision to facilitate the solar and wind energy projects, Shri RK Singh, Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship has approved a proposal to set up a Dispute Resolution Committee to consider the unforeseen disputes between solar/wind power developers and SECI/NTPC, beyond contractual agreement. 

Emphasising the importance of this step, Shri Singh said that the move will give further fillip to the smooth implementation of solar/wind energy projects in India. It fulfils a long pending demand of the industry to resolve expeditiously, unforeseen disputes that may arise beyond the scope of Contractual Agreements. 

 

The Solar and Wind Industry have been demanding setting up of Dispute Resolution Mechanism by MNRE for quite some time, to resolve expeditiously, unforeseen disputes that may arise beyond the scope of Contractual Agreements between solar power developers / wind power developers and SECI/ NTPC.

The issue was considered and it was felt that there is need to erect a transparent, unbiased Dispute Resolution Mechanism, consisting of an independent, transparent and unbiased Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC), for resolving the unforeseen disputes that may arise in implementation of contractual agreements and also for dealing with issues which are beyond the scope of Contractual Agreements between solar power developers/ wind power developers and SECI / NTPC.

The Government after careful examination of the issues involved, have decided as follows – 

(i) A three member Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) will be set up with the approval of Hon’ble Minister (NRE), consisting of eminent persons of impeccable integrity. The upper age for the DRC members shall be 70 years. The Committee members of DRC shall be chosen from the eminent persons located in NCR of Delhi so as to avoid expenditure on Air Travel & accommodation. The selection of DRC Members would be such that there is no conflict of interest involved.
 

 

(ii) The mechanism of Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) will be applicable for all solar/ wind Schemes/ Programmes/ Projects being implemented through/ by SECI/ NTPC.

 

(iii) The DRC will consider following kinds of cases:

 

(a) All cases of appeal against decisions given by SECI on Extension of Time requests based on terms of contract: All requests for extension of time due to recognized ‘Force Majeure’ events like flood, earthquake, delay in handing over of land by Solar Park Developers, delay in connectivity, etc. will be dealt strictly as per Contractual Agreements. In all such cases, the solar power developers / wind power developers shall make an application for grant of Extension of Time (EoT) within the time specified in the Contractual Agreement. If application is not made within the time limit prescribed in the Contractual Agreement, it shall be summarily rejected by SECI/ NTPC. If application is made within the time limit, the request will be examined and final decision given to solar power developer/ wind power developer within twenty-one (21) days from the date of application. No separate extension of time shall be granted for overlapping periods of effect by two or more causes. If the developer is not satisfied with the decision of SECI/ NTPC, then it may appeal to the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC), within 21 days of SECI/NTPC's order after paying a fee, to be decided by the DRC, which in any case shall not be less than 5% of the impact of SECI's/NTPC’s decision being challenged. This fee shall be deposited into the Payment Security Fund maintained by SECI/ NTPC for the project concerned. In case, the Government upholds the appeal in toto, after taking into consideration the recommendation of DRC, and strikes down the SECI order, then the fee so collected shall be refunded, provided the DRC makes a recommendation for the same and the Government passes a specific order to that effect. The Fee which may be received and is not required to be refunded, shall be credited to the appropriate Payment Security Fund being maintained by SECI/NTPC. 

(b) All requests of Extension of Time not covered under the terms of contract: All cases involving unforeseen issues/ circumstances not covered under Contractual Agreements like cases where the site is to be procured by the developer but there is delay in land allotment due to policy change or registration by the Government, delays in grant of proposed connectivity due to court stays, etc., will be placed before the DRC for consideration and make recommendations to M/o New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) for appropriate decision.

(iv) The ‘Dispute Resolution Committee’ (DRC) will examine all such cases referred to it, including the cases where the developer is not satisfied with the decision of SECI/NTPC and it decides to appeal after paying the required fee as laid down under Para (ii) (a) above, in a time bound manner and submit its recommendations to the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), not later than twenty-one (21) days from the date of reference.

(v) The recommendations of the ‘Dispute Resolution Committee’ (DRC) along with MNRE’s observations, will be placed before Hon’ble Minister (NRE) for final decision. The Ministry shall examine and put up such recommendations to Minister (NRE) with the comments of IFD within twenty one (21) days of receipt of recommendation from the DRC.

(vi) To arrive at any decision, Committee will be free to interact with the relevant parties of the case and shall record their views. For presenting the case before the DRC, no lawyers shall be permitted.

                Shri RK Singh, Union Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energyheld a meeting to review various issues pertaining to the Renewable Energy (RE) sector here today. The meeting was attended by various stakeholders including the Secretary, MNRE, senior officials from MNRE, Department of Economic Affairs, Dept. of Expenditure, Dept. of Financial Services, Dept. of Revenue andrepresentatives of Public/Privatebanks and Financial Institutions.

In the meeting, it was decided that MNRE would follow up with RBI for removal of the priority sector lending limit for RE sector. This will encourage the PSBs to lend more for RE projects and help RE developers access easy finance.

In the meeting Shri RK Singh also asked the Banks/Financial Institutes to categorize RE as separate sector different from power sector so that funds would flow to RE projects. He further said that current tariff rates discovered for various RE projects are viable as the maintenance/running cost of RE projects is very less in long run. He also added that with time, the cost of RE technology is coming down whereas the efficiency ofRE equipments is improving day by day. So the low tariffs are not an aberration. The Minister also requested banks to come forward to lend to RE sector.

On the issue of delays in land acquisition for RE projects, the Minister said that SECI will be tying up with State Governments for the land. As the land will be on lease, therefore there won’t be any upfront payment for the land. It will also tie up transmission while floating bids. Banks/Financial Institutions were asked to tie up with SECI for offeringpredeterminedloans to successful bidders.

Discussions were held about the GST issues on RE equipments/ components and Dept. of Revenue was requested to place appropriate proposal before the GST council. The issue of inverted duty structure also came up for discussion during the meeting. The Minister said that every measure need to be taken to promote manufacturing in RE sector in the country, including corrections of duty structure and approval of a scheme to provide capital subsidy.

Discussions were held on starting a pilot project to promote solar cooking in the households.

They observed that this impacts productivity and denies Members the opportunity to express their views on issues of the day. They emphasized that an atmosphere of discussion and dialogue must prevail in Parliament. Participants in the meeting also expressed the hope that approximately half of the members of the 17th Lok Sabha, are first time MPs, who would take this opportunity to carry forward the spirit of constructive dialogue in the House. 

On the issue of One Country, One Election, several Party Presidents supported the proposal for simultaneous conduct of elections. Several parties were also of the view that all aspects of this proposal need to be examined carefully. Shri Modi noted that this is not a single party’s agenda, but it is an issue of national importance and the views of all parties would be considered and given due importance. The Prime Minister announced that a committee will be formed to go examine the issue of ‘One Country, One Election’ threadbare, and come up with suggestions in a time-bound manner. 

Several parties strongly expressed the view that the new generation must be made aware of the ideals and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, and the 150thbirth anniversary of the Mahatma, is an apt occasion to do so. Parties were also of the view that we can take some firm resolves for the development of the country, on this occasion, and aim to accomplish these goals by 2022, the 75thanniversary of independence. 

On the issue of development of aspirational districts, all parties had a constructive view and gave a number of suggestions. Shri Modi said that all State Governments must work in coordination with the Centre to bring the most backward districts in their States at par with the best performing districts. This way the goal of a ‘New India’ would be achieved by 2022, he added.

The Prime Minister thanked the Party Presidents for their participation and constructive suggestions. He said that the next few years represent a historic opportunity, to take the country forward on the path of progress and prosperity.

Other Cabinet Ministers who attended the meeting included, Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah, Minister for Road Transport & Highways and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thawar Chand Gehlot, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines, Shri Pralhad Joshi, among others.

Addressing floor leaders of various parties in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha here today, ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament 2019 beginning tomorrow, Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi called on leaders of all political parties in Parliament to work cohesively with the government in running the House smoothly and to collectively address issues related to the welfare of people. 

 

The Prime Minister welcomed newly elected MPs and expressed hope that fresh zeal and energy would be infused in the functioning of the Parliament. Shri Modi urged all leaders to introspect whether members of Parliament are able to fulfill peoples’ aspirations as their representatives. He said, “We are for the people, we cannot win hearts by disrupting the functioning of the Parliament. All parties must keep political differences aside and commit themselves to tirelessly work in the direction of Nation's progress”. 

 

The Prime Minister exhorted all leaders to cooperate with the Government and strive in the direction of making a New India by 2022 and achieve the true meaning of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'. Shri Modi said that Government is always receptive to the issues raised by all Political Parties and is ready to discuss all issues of national importance on the floor of both Houses of Parliament.

 

A host of issues were brought up by the leaders of parties during the meeting. There was a consensus across party lines on ensuring smooth functioning of the Parliament without disruptions and deadlocks to be resolved through constructive discussions in both the Houses.

Shri Joshi said that, in order to build esprit de corps among members of all parties in Parliament, the Prime Minister has put forward two new initiatives with the beginning of 17th Lok Sabha. To begin the newly constituted Lok Sabha on a positive note, Shri Modi has invited Party Presidents of all political parties with representation in the Parliament, on 19th June, and MPs of both Houses, on 20th June, to freely interact and exchange views with the Government. This novel initiative would go a long way to build team spirit among all Parliamentarians and in turn would ensure smooth functioning of Parliament in future, Shri Joshi said. 

Giving details about the ensuing budget session, Shri Joshi informed that the first session of 17thLok Sabha is scheduled to commence on Monday, 17th June, 2019 and 249th session of Rajya Sabha on 20th June, 2019.  Subject to exigencies of Government Business, the Session may conclude on Friday, 26thJuly, 2019.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh inaugurated the Integrated Grievance Cell & Call Center for Pensioners set up by the Department of Pension and Pensioners Welfare, here today. The Center has been launched for Central Government pensioners at Janpath Bhawan, in New Delhi. The Secretary, DARPG and Department of Pension and Pensioners Welfare, Shri K. V. Eapen and senior officers of the Department were also present on the occasion. The Minister also interacted with the Pensioners Welfare Executives and understood the response received by them from the pensioners. 

Dr Jitendra Singh congratulated the Department for the initiative of creating a call centre for the pensioners. He said that this is one of the Department’s big announcements in the first 100 days of the Government with an objective to make life easy for our Pensioners. The Minister said that, in addition to resolving grievances of the pensioners, it will help in value addition to the whole process, as the pensioners will gradually provide inputs and suggestions in the form of feedback that will help the Department in the long run. This centre will also act as pressure on the departments to resolve the problems of the elderly pensioners, he added. 

The Minister said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Government has taken many initiatives for the welfare of pensioners in the last five years and the Department of Pensions has become more active and focused with various out of box initiatives to provide ease of living to the pensioners. The Minister spoke about initiatives to provide ease of governance such as Digital Life Certificates (DLCs), Anubahv and Bhavishya. He expressed his assurance that these centres will play a productive role in future. The Minister also mentioned about the All India Pension Adalat held on September 18, 2018, which was an attempt to devote one day in the year to Pensioners.  These Adalats were conducted across Ministries/Departments throughout the country including all the central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs). 

Keeping in view the great discomfort experienced by very senior and ailing Pensioners in queuing up outside Banks in the month of November to give their Life Certificate, the Department undertook a path breaking initiative: Involve Pensioners' Associations in 8 cities on a pilot basis and obtain ‘Digital Life certificate From Home’ of such Pensioners. This was a pilot program conducted in Noida/Delhi, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Mumbai, Mysore, Vadodara, Thiruvananthapuram & Bengaluru. Till December last year, 2,480 number of DLCs were obtained from home of aged Pensioners. This year, this facility would be extended from 8 to 20 cities (additional ones are Hyderabad, Ranchi, Bhuvneshwar, Jaipur, Thrissur, Kolkata, Cuttack, Chennai, Guwahati, Madurai, Balasore, Jalandhar, Ahmadabad, Allahabad and Pune). 

A major step towards Digitization was the ‘Bhavishya’ software, indigenously made by the Department of Pensions and meant to be a common platform for processing of pension cases on this platform by all civil Ministries and Departments of Government of India. This software brought on a common platform all the stakeholders who were till date decentralized on to a single platform.  As on date in 792 offices pension papers are moving electronically from retiree to Head of Office, Pay and Account Office and to CPAO. Till date, 6950 DDOs are on the board of Bhavishya and currently processing pension cases of approximately 35,000 retiring/retired employees/family pensioners.  This application has so far cumulatively processed cases in respect of about 1,00,000 employees till date.  After converting Ministries/Departments, Bhavishya has been expanded to cover Central Government employees working under UTs and Delhi Police Administration.  

The online CPENGRAM system along with the Mobile App and also registering of grievances received by post have been very effective in addressing the grievances in the past. The faith of the Pensioners has gone up in the system due to which yearly more and more Pensioners have taken resort to get their grievances sorted out through CPENGRAMS.  Although, this call centre facility has been created primarily for the retired officials of Central Government, the State Government retired officials are also calling on this number for their pension related grievances.  

This facility will further be expanded keeping in view the volume of call traffic received through the system. The objective is to promote Ease of registering grievance and resolution of the same as a measure of Good Governance.

                Shri Ajit Seth, former Cabinet Secretary and Shri V. Srinivas, Additional Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances addressed a 27-member delegation of Permanent Secretaries and Deputy Permanent Secretaries on “Transparency and Accountability in Governance” at the National Center for Good Governance, Mussoorie. The National Center for Good Governance is conducting a Special Training Program for Senior Civil Servants of Gambia under the  Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation program (ITEC). 

In the Chairman’s remarks, Shri Ajit Seth said that the Right to Information enabled improving governance in India by bringing transparency in decisions regarding major contracts, settlement of disputes and clarity in land matters. The large scale adoption of the Aadhar for subsidy disbursement has strengthened India’s fight against corruption. Reminscing his years as Cabinet Secretary, Shri Ajit Seth said that India’s democracy is based on strong institutions and clear separation of powers between the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. India’s civil servants recruited through one of the world’s most competitive examinations have strived to build strong institutions. The steel frame of India’s governance helped develop process-driven governance which is rule based, with adequate accountability. India’s civil service practices included a mapping of career paths and continuous performance assessment. 

As the lead speaker, Shri V.Srinivas, Additional Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances said that the bulwark of good governance policies are accountability, transparency, stakeholder participation, judicial framework and fight against corruption. He said that the challenges India’s IAS officers face in the 21st century are no different from those of the 20th century – “commitment to the larger public good against all odds.” He said that the motto “I am ethical, I am accountabe and I am the IAS” is reflective of India’s constitutional values deeply rooted in high moral tones with a universal dimension. Shri V. Srinivas deliberated on the constitutional provisions of Articles 309, 310 and 311 dealing with services and the 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission recommendation that Article 309 “Recruitment and Conditions of Service of Persons serving the Union and the State” should be further strengthened to protect bonafide actions by civil servants. He elaborated the All India Services (Conduct) Rules 1968 which placed highest emphasis on ‘maintaining integrity and absolute devotion to duty.’ 

Shri V. Srinivas said that India’s fight against corruption is based on enhanced use of technology, increased transparency, greater stakeholder engagement, severe penalties with timebound completion of disciplinary proceedings, credible deterrance with strong audit and accounting mechanisms. The Central Vigilance Commission has promoted Vigilance Awareness Weeks to “Eradicate Corruption and Build a New India.” He added that strong individuals build strong institutions.  The common traits of institution builders are an “Aim High attitude”, deep commitment to pro-poor policies, deep understanding of India’s institutions, courage, conviction and integrity to take decisions in critical challenging times, and the capacity to engage with the political leadership in coherent policy discussions. 

During discussions, the Permanent Secretaries of Gambia appreciated the progress made by India in the areas of transparency and accountability with independent constitutional bodies like the Central Information Commission, the Central Vigilance Commissoin and C&AG. They felt that it was a unique opportunity for Gambia’s senior officials to understand the best practices of India’s governance model.

                Article 279A (5) of the Constitution provides that Goods and Services Tax Council shall recommend the date on which goods and services tax shall be levied on petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel. Thus while, petroleum products are constitutionally included under GST, the date on which GST shall be levied on such goods, shall be as per the decision of the GST Council. As per the section 9(2) of the CGST Act, inclusion of all excluded petroleum products, including petrol and diesel in GST will require recommendation of the GST Council.

All the States and Union Territories (UT) with Legislature are represented in the GST Council by their Minister-in-charge of Finance or Taxation or any other Minister nominated by the State/UT. Any decision regarding levy of GST on petroleum products has to be decided as per recommendation of the GST Council.

                The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) authorizes entities to develop Natural Gas Distribution Network as per PNGRB Act, 2006 and the Regulations notified thereunder. PNGRB identifies the Geographical Areas (GAs) for the development of City Gas Distribution (CGD) network depending on the natural gas pipeline connectivity/natural gas availability and techno-commercial viability. Providing Piped Natural Gas (PNG) connection to the households in the GA is the part of development of CGD Network. With the completion of 10th CGD Bidding Round, CGD would be accessible in 228 GAs covering more than 400 districts spread over 27 States and Union Territories covering approximately 70 percent of India’s population and 53 percent of its geographical area.  

 

In order to promote the expansion of City gas networks and enhance the usage of natural gas in cities, the Government has taken following steps:


	Domestic gas, which is cheaper than imported gas, has been allocated to meet the entire requirement of Piped Natural Gas (Domestic) and Compressed Natural Gas (Transport) segments of CGD sector and it has been kept under no cut category.
	Public Utility Status granted to CGD Projects by Ministry of Labour and Employment. 
	Ministry of Defence has issued guidelines for use of PNG in its residential areas/unit lines
	Department of Public Enterprises has issued guidelines to Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) to have the provisions of PNG in their respective residential complexes.
	Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has issued advisory to State Governments  on following aspects:



	To standardize the Road Restoration/permission charges along with time bound permission in accordance with the local conditions.
	Earmarking of land plot for development of CNG Stations at the planning stage of town/city and same should be specified in the revised Master Plan.
	Relevant modification in building by-laws for providing gas pipeline infrastructure in residential & commercial buildings at architectural design stage.



	Further, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has directed to Central Public Works Department & National Building Construction Corporation to have the provisions of PNG in all Government Residential complexes.

                As on 20.06.2019, Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have released more than 7.23 crore LPG connections under Pradhan Mantri UjjwalaYojana (PMUY). 

OMCs have reported that till May 2019, 1.67 crore and 1.45 crore PMUY beneficiaries have purchased the refills 4 and 5 times respectively. OMCs have also reported that nearly 86% of PMUY beneficiaries who are atleast one year old have returned for the second refill.

OMCs have reported that surveys/studies have been conducted by some Agencies/Institutes/Organizations involving PMUY beneficiaries. The use of LPG by PMUY beneficiary household depends on several factors which include food habits, cooking habits, availability and accessibility to LPG, price of LPG, availability of free firewood, cow dung etc.

                The National Policy on Biofuels-2018 notified on 8.6.2018, inter-alia, allows production of ethanol from damaged food grains like wheat, broken rice etc. which are unfit for human consumption. The policy also allows conversion of surplus quantities of food grains to ethanol, based on the approval of National Biofuel Coordination Committee.  

Use of damaged foodgrains and surplus foodgrains for production of ethanol will increase its availability for Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme.  During the ethanol supply year 2017-18, 150.5 crore litres of ethanol was blended in Petrol which resulted in foreign exchange impact of about Rs. 5070 crore and carbon emission reduced to the extent of 29.94 lakh tonnes.            

The National Policy on Biofuels-2018 approved by the Government envisages an indicative target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol and 5% blending of bio-diesel in diesel by 2030. Under EBP programme, ethanol blending in petrol is being undertaken by the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) in whole country except island Union Territory (UT) of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep wherein, OMCs blend up to 10 % ethanol in petrol under the EBP Programme.          

Further, Government has approved Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana to provide Viability Gap Funding (VGF) to Second Generation bio-ethanol manufacturing projects to increase availability of ethanol for EBP programme. Ministry has also issued Gazette Notification dated 1.5.2019 on “Guidelines for sale of Biodiesel for blending with high speed diesel for transportation purposes-2019” dated 30.4.2019.

            Government has decided to leapfrog directly to  BS-VI quality w.e.f. 1st April, 2020 in the entire country. Considering the rise in environmental pollution in National Capital Region, Government has started supply of BS-VI auto fuel in National Capital Territory of Delhi from 1st April, 2018.  Further, in line with the directions issued by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, supply of BS-VI auto fuel has started in ten districts of National Capital Region and three other districts/cities outside of National Capital Region (Karauli, Dhaulpur and city of Agra) w.e.f. 1st April, 2019.

                Portability option for transfer of LPG connection was launched across the country in 2013.  Subsequently, the process of online transfer of connection within same market was made fully automatic for the transfers within the same Oil Marketing Company (OMC).

Through this initiative, the consumer is empowered to choose his/her destination distributor online from his registered login without the intervention of his parent distributor. In this process event the Transfer Subscription Voucher (TSV) is delivered at customer premises by the destination distributor and it does away for the consumer to physically approach both the distributors with a transfer request. The process of transfer of connection also entails email information to customer on each stage of transfer of connection.

In case of Inter Company Connection Transfer, both parent and destination distributor get advance intimation about consumer’s transfer request with tracking options for customers. However, the Customer needs to visit the parent distributorship for surrendering of LPG equipments as accounting of equipment and security deposit is involved.  

OMCs have reported that since the launch of Scheme till 18.6.2019, more than 4.2 lakh consumers have used this option for getting their connection transferred to their preferred/required distributor online under the portability scheme. OMCs have reported that the complaints pertaining to portability scheme are resolved immediately and there are Nil established cases of complaints on portability. OMCs have reported that they have received suggestions on Portability scheme and in March, 2016, the process of online transfer of connection within same market was made fully automatic for the transfers within the OMC thereby doing away with the physical requirement of approaching the distributor with a transfer request. The portability scheme is now available across the country.

                The policy initiatives taken by the Government to increase domestic production of oil and gas include:-

 


	Policy for Relaxations, Extensions and Clarifications under Production Sharing Contract (PSC) regime for early monetization of hydrocarbon discoveries
	Discovered Small Field Policy
	Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy
	Policy for Extension of Production Sharing Contracts
	Policy for early monetization of Coal Bed Methane
	Setting up of National Data Repository
	Appraisal of Unappraised areas in Sedimentary Basins.
	Re-assessment of Hydrocarbon Resources.
	Policy framework to streamline the working of Production Sharing Contracts in Pre-NELP and NELP Blocks
	Policy to Promote and Incentivize Enhanced Recovery Methods for Oil and Gas
	Policy framework for exploration and exploitation of Unconventional Hydrocarbons under existing Production Sharing Contracts, Coal Bed Methane contracts and Nomination fields


 

The Government in February, 2019 approved major reforms in exploration and licensing policy to enhance exploration activities, attract domestic and foreign investment in unexplored/unallocated areas of sedimentary basins and accelerate domestic production of oil and gas from existing fields. The policy reforms, inter alia, aims to  boost exploration activities with greater weightage to work programme, simplified fiscal and contractual terms, bidding of exploration blocks under Category II and III sedimentary basins without any production or revenue sharing to Government, early monetization of discoveries by extending fiscal incentives, incentivizing gas production including marketing and pricing freedom, induction of latest technology and capital, more functional freedom to National Oil Companies for collaboration and private sector participation for production enhancement methods in nomination fields, streamlining approval processes and promoting ease of doing business including electronic single window mechanism.

      Supply of Natural Gas in form of Piped Natural Gas (PNG) to households, commercial units and industries and supply of Natural Gas in form of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) to vehicles are part of development of City Gas Distribution (CGD) network and the same is carried out by the entities authorized by Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB). So far, PNGRB has authorized 228 Geographical Areas (GAs) for development of CGD network across country till 10th CGD Bidding Round. 298 districts have been covered under 9th and 10th CGD Bidding Round for supply of PNG and CNG.

OMCs have issued instructions to the distributors to provide portable weighing scales to all their delivery boys so that weight of the cylinder can be checked before delivery to the customers. In case any underweight cylinder is detected during delivery, the same is required to be replaced by the distributor.

          Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) has informed one established case of supply of partially used cylinders/pilfered cylinders in the State of Maharashtra during the last three years i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited(HPCL) have reported no established case of supply of partially used cylinders/pilfered cylinders.

          Measures are taken by the OMCs to ensure correct weight of cylinder at bottling plant, distributor’s end, en-route and at customer’s end. The important measures include visual checking for defective cylinder, segregation before filling, automatic filling, quality checks, pre-delivery checks, random checks at delivery points as well as en-route, inspection/raids by authorities, checking for weight and leakage before installation, investigation of complaints and timely action in case of malpractices etc. 

          This information was given by the Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production

 

 

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

 


	
	
		Crude oil production by ONGC during May, 2019 was 1759.58 TMT which is marginally lower by 0.25%than the monthly target and4.42%lower when compared with May,2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-May, 2019 was 3450.35 TMT which is 0.17%lower than target for the period andlowerby 4.64% thanproduction during corresponding period of last year. Major reasons for lower production is less off take by consumers in Tripura, Cauvery & Rajahmundry.
	
	


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by OIL during May, 2019 was273.95 TMT which is 3.84%lower than monthly target and 3.88% lower when compared with May, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-May, 2019 was 539.16 TMT which is 3.94% lower than target for the period and3.61%lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reasons for lower production isless than planned contribution from work over wells and drilling wells. 
	
	


 


	
	
		Crude oil production byPvt/JVs during May,2019 was 766.59 TMT which is 9.70%lower than the monthly target and 13.08%lowerthanMay, 2018.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-May, 2019 was 1529.10 TMT which is 4.96%lowerthan target for the period and 12.38% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
	
	


 

v RJ-ON-90/1 (CEIL): Deficit is from Mangla due to delay in 45 FM infills. 

v Lower work over (WO) and production enhancement activities due to one work over rig being taken offline for mandatory maintenance and HSE compliance. 

v Operational issues in Bhagyam, Aishwarya, ABHand RDG fields.

v CB-ONN-2005/9 (Mercator): Stoppage in from Jyoti-1 is stopped. Well closed for long term pressure build up study and could not be put back in production due to non-grant of EC for development campaign. 

v The other discovery well, Jyoti-2 is not yet activated and is under WO from 31.03.19.  


	The delay in drilling the new development well is primarily due to non-grant of EC for development campaign till date.

		CPSE Refineries’ production during May, 2019 was 11896.24TMT which is 3.63% lower than the target for the month and 7.01%lowerwhen compared with May, 2018.Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-May, 2019 was 23159.56 TMT which is 3.54% lower than the target for the period and5.19% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:
	
	


 


	HPCL, Mumbai: Lower due to planned shutdown of secondary units.
	HPCL, Visakh: Lower due to crude mix impact.
	CPCL, Manali: Lower due to non receipt of crude vessel at oil jetty BD-3 owing to repair work by Chennai Port. 
	NRL, Numaligarh: Lower due to lower crude receipt.
	MRPL, Mangalore: Lower due to restrictionsin supply of water to refinery.

                Shri RK Singh, Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship in a major decision has approved the proposal to make it mandatory for distribution licencees to open and maintain adequate Letter of Credit (LC) as Payment Security Mechanism under Power Purchase Agreements. Speaking about the decision, Shri Singh said that, “This will change the system and the sector will become viable.”

Accordingly, Ministry of Power has issued the following order today - 

 

1.0 Under the Electricity Act 2003, Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDC) and State Load Despatch Centres (SLDC) are cast with the statutory responsibility to ensure that that the supply of electricity is made in accordance with the contracts.

 

2.0 Section 28 (3) (a) of the Electricity Act 2003 provides that the Regional Load Despatch Centre shall be responsible for optimum scheduling and despatch of electricity within the region, in accordance with the contracts entered into with the licensees or the generating companies operating in the region.

 

3.0 Similarly as per provisions of Section 32 (2)(a) the State Load Despatch Centre shall be responsible for optimum scheduling and despatch of electricity within a State, in accordance with the contracts entered into with the licensees or the generating companies operating in that State.

 

4.0 The Power Purchase Agreements have the provision regarding maintenance of adequate Payment Security Mechanism mainly in the form of Letters of Credit by the Distribution Licensees/ Procurers of Power. A robust Payment Security System requires adequacy and validity of Letter of Credit to cover the payments due on account of drawal of power.

 

5.0 It has been seen that despite the above provisions, the Letters of Credit are not being given and there is huge outstanding on account of unpaid power bills. This makes it difficult for the Generators to pay for the fuel, which has to be pre-paid, to continue the generation. The Generators are also required to pay to the Railways in advance for the rakes. If this situation persists, the Generators will not be able to pay for fuel/transportation leading to shortfall in generation of electricity. There will thus be wide spread load shedding on account of lack of generation. It is essential therefore that all the provisions mentioned above are implemented strictly. NLDC & RLDC are therefore directed as follows: 


	In accordance with Section 28 (3) (a), the NLDC & RLDC shall despatch power only after it is intimated by the Generating Company and /Distribution Companies that a Letter of Credit for the desired quantum of power has been opened and copies made available to the concerned Generating Company. 
	The intimation to NLDC and RLDC shall specify the period of supply.


 


	RLDC shall dispatch electricity only up to the quantity equivalent of value of Letter of Credit.
	The dispatch shall stop once the quantum of electricity under LC is supplied. 
	The concerned generating company shall be entitled to encash the LC after expiry of grace period, i.e. 45 to 60 days as provided in the PPA.
	In the event power is not dispatched for any reason given above, the Distribution licensee shall continue to pay the Fixed Charge to the Generating Company. 


6.0 It shall also be ensured by the Load Despatch Centre that the regulated entity, during the period of regulation, has no access to procure power from the Power Exchanges and they shall not be granted Short Term Open Access (STOA).

7.0 In case scheduling and despatch of power produced by any generator is not done due to non-opening of Letter of Credit by the Distribution licensee, then the Distribution licensee would be liable to pay compensation to the generator as per the terms of Power Purchase Agreement or Power Sale Agreement, as the case may be, the distribution licensee has entered in with the generator.

8.0 NLDC/ RLDC/SLDC shall carry out such duty cast under Electricity Act, 2003 from 01.08.2019.

                A Review Meeting was taken by Shri RK Singh, Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship to discuss implementation issues regarding the mechanism issued by Ministry of Power for providing Flexibility in generation and scheduling of thermal power stations to reduce emissions. The meeting was attended by Secretary, Power Shri Ajay Kumar Bhalla, senior officials from Ministry of Power, MNRE, CEA, CERC, POSOCO and NTPC. 

The mechanism of allowing Flexibility in Generation and Scheduling of Thermal Power Stations was issued by the Ministry of Power. Under the mechanism a Generating Company may establish or procure renewable energy generating capacity anywhere in the country and utilize such renewable capacities for supplying the power against existing commitments. There were certain issues which required resolution for smooth implementation of the above mechanism. 

Power Minister has given appropriate directions to resolve such issues. He said that the focus of the Government is on growth of the Renewable Energy in the country. Highlighting India’s commitments at international fora, the Minister said that all necessary policy support should be provided for encouraging Renewable Energy capacity addition leading to energy security and environmental protection.

                As per Vision Document 2020, Government has planned to connect all State Capitals of North Eastern States by 2020 except Sikkim in which case, new line work has been sanctioned up to Rangpo in first phase. The capitals of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura States have been connected by Broad Gauge (BG) rail network. 

 

Great emphasis has been given by Central Government during last 5 years towards quick execution of infrastructure and safety projects and funding to the infrastructure projects has increased considerably. The average annual expenditure in New Line / Gauge Conversion / Doubling infrastructure projects during 2014-19 was ` 25,894 crore per year as against `11,527 crore per year during 2009-14 which is around 125% more than during 2009-14.  The average allotment per year for North Eastern States was ` 2,121 crore per year from 2009-14.  However, it increased 161% to `5,531 crore per year for this region during 2014-19.

 

In Arunachal Pradesh, a BG railway line was commissioned in February, 2015 upto Naharlagun (suburban city of Itanagar) and first Broad Gauge (BG) train was flagged by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 20.02.2015 from Naharlagun (Itanagar) to New Delhi. Long pending and delayed work of Bogibeel Bridge on Brahmaputra river was completed in 2018 leading to further reduction of travel distance from Dibrugarh to Naharlagun (Itanagar) by 705 km (via Guwahati).

 

First BG trial train to the State of Tripura (Agartala) was received by Hon’ble Minister of State of Railways on 13.01.2016 and first BG passenger train (long distance) was introduced to Delhi on 31.07.2016.

 

In some States, the progress of new line projects of Capital connectivity has been affected mainly due to delay in land acquisition and law & order issues. All these Capital connectivity projects being in hilly terrain of Himalayas involve large number of tunnels and major bridges including very tall bridges in a very challenging geological environment.

 

Works of new BG lines have been taken up by Railway by its own fund to connect the remaining Capitals of North Eastern States i.e. Meghalaya (Shillong), Manipur (Imphal), Nagaland (Kohima), Mizoram (Aizawl) and Sikkim (Gangtok). Details with present status of these projects are as under:

 

(1) Manipur:  The project of BG line connectivity from Jiribam to Imphal (110.62 km) in Manipur State was sanctioned in 2003-04. The latest anticipated cost of the project is ` 13,809 crore and expenditure of ` 6,969.49 crore has been incurred on the project upto 31.03.2019.

 

The section from Jiribam to Vangaichungpao (12 km) was commissioned in March, 2017 and works from Vangaichungpao-Tupul-Imphal (98.62 km) have been taken up throughout the length.  The work of land acquisition has been completed in 102.62 km length of the project and work of acquisition of balance land of 8 km length has been taken up. Target date for completion is 3 years after complete land is handed over to the Railways.

 

(2)  Mizoram:   The project of BG line connectivity from Bhairabi to Sairang (51.38 km) (suburban city of Aizawl, the Capital city of Mizoram) in Mizoram was sanctioned in 2008-09.  The latest anticipated cost of the project is ` 4,968 crore and the land could be made available in 2014-15 and work speeded up from 2015-16 & the expenditure of ` 1,958.09 crore has been incurred on the project upto 31.03.2019.

 

The construction work has been taken up throughout the length of project and 80% tunneling work has been completed and the work on 6 tall bridges has been taken up.  For complete commissioning of the project, the work of acquisition of balance 53.90 Hectare of land has been taken up.  Target date for completion for complete project is 2 years after complete land is handed over to Railways.

 

(3) Nagaland: The project of BG line connectivity from Dimapur (Dhansiri) -  Zubza (Kohima) (82.50 km) (suburban city of Kohima, the Capital city of Nagaland) in Nagaland was sanctioned in 2006-07.  The latest anticipated cost of the project is ` 3,000 crore and the work speeded up from September, 2018 and the expenditure of ` 626.67 crore has been incurred on the project upto 31.03.2019.

 

The construction work has been taken up throughout the length of project.  For complete commission of the project, the work of acquiring balance land in 6 km length has been taken up (ownership disputes).  Target date for completion for complete project is 3 years after complete land is handed over to Railways.

 

(4) Meghalaya:   Two projects of BG line have been taken up for Capital connectivity of Meghalaya. 

 


	New BG line from Tetelia – Byrnihat (21.50 km) in Meghalaya was sanctioned in 2006-07. The latest anticipated cost of the project is ` 1,532 crore and the work speeded up from 2014-15, 10 km length of the project falling in Assam State from Tetelia to Kamalajari got completed in October, 2018 and expenditure of ` 515.82 crore has been incurred upto 31.03.2019.  Some organizations are stating that a railway connectivity may lead to influx of outsiders and this has led to some local resistance to this project.  Now, the issue has been taken up for early resolution. Target date for completion not fixed, as the same would be decided, once the complete land is physically handed over to Railways.


 


	New BG line from Byrnihat to Shillong (108.40 km) was sanctioned in 2010-11.  The latest anticipated cost of the project is ` 6,000 crore and the expenditure of ` 252.68 crore has been incurred on the project upto 31.03.2019.  Target date for completion not fixed, as the same would be decided, once the land is physically handed over to Railways.


 

(5)  Sikkim:  The project of BG line connectivity from Sivok to Rangpo (44.39 km) was sanctioned in 2008-09.  The latest anticipated cost of the project is ` 4,085.69 crore and the expenditure of ` 554.46 crore has been incurred on the project upto 31.03.2019.

 

However, the project is suffering for a long time as the Government of West Bengal has not given encumbrance free land (77.78 Hectare forest land after cutting of trees) to Railway due to which, even the timely finalization of tenders is getting affected.  The issue is being consistently chased with Government of West Bengal.  Target date for completion for complete project is 3 years after complete physical possession of land given to Railways.

 

This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

                Railways have constituted an interdepartmental ‘Joint Committee’ comprising officers of Safety, Security, Signal & Engineering departments across all Zonal Railways to study the causes and suggest specific measures to minimise deaths due to untoward incidents including trespassing.  Accordingly, preventive and corrective measures are taken to improve and create infrastructure to minimise casualties.  

 

Besides, the following corrective measures are also being taken by the Railways to prevent deaths in untoward incidents on Railway track:-

 


	Railways has been constructing FOBs at places where passengers are required to cross tracks.
	Regular announcements are made through Passenger Address System at Railway stations urging passengers to use foot over bridges (FOBs) and to avoid crossing of railway tracks.   
	Various awareness campaigns are organized by Railways to sensitize passengers about the fatalities of crossing railway tracks, foot-board/ roof-top travelling, boarding/de-boarding running trains etc. 
	Regular drives are conducted against trespassing, travelling on foot-board, steps, roof top of trains, boarding/de-boarding running trains and the persons apprehended are prosecuted under the relevant provisions of the Railways Act, 1989.
	Railway Protection Force personnel are deployed on locations vulnerable for trespassing. 
	Erection of boundary wall/fencing at identified locations, vulnerable to trespass. 
	Warning sign boards are provided at conspicuous places for the awareness of passengers.
	Unauthorized trespassing on Railway premises including the Railway track is a punishable offence under section 147 of the Railways Act, 1989.  During the current year upto May, 2019, total 60740 persons have been prosecuted for trespassing.


 

Ministry of Railways has planned to construct boundary wall/fencing at vulnerable locations and approaches of major railway stations to guard tracks from cattle crossing and to prevent unauthorized trespassing. During the financial year 2018-19, Ministry of Railways has sanctioned works worth ` 3150 cr. for provision of boundary wall at identified vulnerable locations and their approaches to safeguard track, prevent encroachment and to improve safety of track over Indian Railways.

                During rush period like festivals, summer vacations, holidays etc. when demand exceeds availability, some instances of attempt to misuse reservation system do come to notice. However, in order to prevent the activities of unscrupulous elements including touts, several checks have been deployed by Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) including the following:


	Creation of only one IRCTC User ID on a given mobile number and email ID.
	Setting a limit of booking 6 Railway tickets by an individual user in a month. This limit has been revised to 12 Railway tickets in a month for those individual users who have linked their IRCTC user ID with their respective Aadhaar number and ensured that at least one of the passengers in the passenger list is verifiable through Aadhaar.
	Checking of User IDs on daily basis and deactivation of those IDs found using malpractices like fast booking of tickets. Around 1.26 lakh user IDs have been deactivated from 1st April 2018 to 31st May 2019.
	Checking of Tatkal tickets booked in first minute for frivolous users on daily basis and cancellation/release of such tickets on suspicion.
	Only one booking in one user login session except for return/ onward journey between 0800 and 1200 hours. 
	Checks applied on minimum time required to enter the passenger details and displayed CAPTCHA at the time of e-ticket booking by users. 
	Restriction on authorized agents of IRCTC for booking tickets during first fifteen minutes of opening of Advance Reservation Period (ARP) booking and Tatkal booking.


 

Regular checks are conducted in mass contact areas such as Passenger Reservation System (PRS) centres, booking offices, platforms, trains etc. to prevent unauthorized ticketing activities including the use of scripting software. Such checks are also intensified during peak period like festivals, holidays etc. The number of touts/brokers arrested by Railway Protection Force along with number of e-tickets seized from them is as under:-

                Indian Railways uses approximately 56 Million Units of Electrical Energy per day. Indian Railways is taking the following steps for giving a thrust for use of environmental friendly technologies:

 


	Railway Electrification of tracks - IR has decided to electrify 100% of its Broad Gauge Rail routes in mission mode; as a green mode of transport.
	Use of renewable energy - IR has planned to source about 1000 Mega Watt (MW) Solar Power and 200 MW of Wind Power.
	Various Energy efficiency measures taken to reduce carbon footprints, which include the following:



	Use of energy efficient 3-Phase technology with regenerative features for electric locomotives, Mainline Electrical Multiple Units (MEMUs), Electrical Multiple Units (EMU), trains sets for better energy efficiency.
	Introduction of Head On Generation (HOG) system in trains to reduce diesel fuel consumption in power cars.
	Provision of energy efficient Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting in all Railway installations including Railway stations, service buildings, Residential quarters & coaches for reduction in electricity consumption.
	Regular energy audits at consumption points - Energy Efficiency studies of six (6) Production Units (PUs) and four (4) Workshops were conducted and upto15% energy efficiency improvement achieved. This included activities like identification of significant energy saving opportunities, one day training program, identification of potential technology suppliers who can offer energy saving technologies to the units etc.
	Emphasis on use of 5 Star rated electrical equipments.
	Regular training of Loco pilots for use of coasting, regenerative braking features and switching off blowers of electric locos in case yard detention is more than 50 minutes. Similarly, diesel locos are also shut down if expected detention is more than 30 minutes and thereby resulting in reduction of Green House Gases (GHG) emissions.
	Trailing locomotive of multi units (MU) hauling empty freight trains are switched off to save energy.
	Energy consumption on electric locomotives is regularly monitored through microprocessor based energy meters provided in all the electric locomotives and benchmarking is done based on average energy consumption.
	Monitoring the fuel consumption with respect to trip ration of diesel locomotive drivers.
	Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) has been provided in 986 diesel locomotives to reduce fuel consumption when locomotive is idle.
	Monitoring of idling of diesel locomotives is being done through remote monitoring and management of Locomotives and trains (called as REMMLOT). 2606 locomotives at present are equipped with REMMLOT.
	Use of 5% bio-diesel in traction fuel- Blending of bio-diesel with HSD, to the extent of 5%, to save HSD.
	20% Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) substitution in DEMUs -CNG usageemits less GHG than liquid fuels. Indian Railways have the distinction of being the only railway in the world to be using CNG run power cars for passenger transportation. IR has also started conversion of DEMU Driving Power Car (DPC) into dual fuel mode DEMU/DPC with CNG. 25 number of DPCs have been converted and are under operation.

                Indian Railways have taken several key measures, as a result of which the number of consequential train accidents have decreased from 118 in 2013-14 to 104 in 2016-17, to 73 in 2017-18 and further to 59 in 2018-19. These are the lowest ever figures in the history of Indian Railways.

 

Safety is accorded the highest priority by Indian Railways and all possible steps are undertaken on a continual basis to prevent accidents and to enhance safety of passengers. Following steps/measures have been taken to prevent accidents:-

 


	Rashtriya  Rail  Sanraksha  Kosh  (RRSK)  has  been  introduced  in 2017-18 for replacement/renewal/upgradation of critical satety assets, with a corpus of ₹1 lakh crore for five years, having annual outlay of ₹ 20000 crore.


 


	Indian Railways has already adopted the technological upgradation in safety aspects of coaches and wagons by way of introducing Modified Centre Buffer Couplers, Bogie Mounted Air Brake System (BMBS), improved suspension design and provision of Automatic fire & smoke detection system in coaches. These modifications are being provided in newly manufactured coaches and wagons on a regular basis.


 


	Conventional ICF design coaches being replaced with LHB design coaches of Mail/Express trains in phased manner.


 


	A GPS based Fog Pass device is being provided to loco pilots in fog affected areas which enables loco pilots to know the exact distance of the approaching landmarks like signals, level crossing gates etc.


 


	In order to improve safety, modern track structure consisting of Prestressed Concrete Sleeper (PSC), 60 KG, 90 or higher Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) rails, fanshaped layout turnout on PSC sleepers, Steel Channel Sleepers on girder bridges is used while carrying out primary track renewals.


 


	Long rail panels of 260 M/130M length are being manufactured at the steel plant to minimize number of Alumino Thermit joints in the track.


 


	Provision of Thick Web Switches (TWS) is planned for all important routes of IR. To expedite provision of TWS, procurement of Thick Web Switches has been decentralized to zonal railways.
	Ultrasonic Flaw Detection (USFD) testing of rails to detect flaws and timely removal of defective rails.


 


	Mechanization of track maintenance is being carried out to reduce human errors and track management system has been introduced on Indian Railways for development of database and decision support system and to decide rationalize maintenance requirement and optimize inputs.


 


	Electrical/Electronic Interlocking System with centralized operation of points and signals are being provided to eliminate accident due to human failure and to replace old mechanical systems. Track Circuiting of stations to enhance safety for verification of track occupancy by electrical means instead of human element. Axle Counter for Automatic clearance of Block Section (BPAC) to ensure complete arrival of train without manual intervention before granting line clear to the next train and to reduce human element.


 


	Train Protection and Warning System: Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) based on European Technology ETCS Level-1, a proven Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System to avoid train accident /collision on account of human error of Signal Passing at Danger (SPAD) or over speeding, has been provided on


 

(i) Noapara – Kavi Subhash section of Kolkata Metro (28 RKMs) (ii) Chennai - Gumidipundi suburban section of Southern Railway (50 RKMs), Basin Bridge – Arrakkonam section of Southern Railway (67 RKMs) (iii) Hazrat Nizamuddin – Agra section of Northern/North Central Railway (200 RKMs).

 


	Auxiliary Warning System (AWS): An ATP called Auxiliary Warning


 

System (AWS) is presently functional on 413 RKMs in the Mumbai suburban section of Central Railway (289 RKMs) and Western Railway (124 RKMs).

 


	Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS): TCAS is an Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System being developed in association with 3 Indian manufacturers. The system has been installed on Lingampalli – Vikarabad – Wadi, Vikarabad - Bidar section (250 RKMs) on South Central Railway. Extensive field trials and safety validation of the system to Safety Integrity Level 4 (SIL-4) by Independent Safety Assessors (ISA) has been completed. Product of all the 3 firms has been approved by RDSO for developmental order for speeds up to 110 Kmph in Absolute Block Sections.


 

         Each and every consequential train accident on Indian Railways (IR) is inquired into either by the Commission of Railways Safety under the Ministry of Civil Aviation or by Departmental Enquiry Committee to analyze for the identification of the role of operational issues and other factors in train accidents. Every inquiry gives its findings about the cause of the accident, fixes responsibility and suggests measures to prevent accidents. Various corrective measures are taken by the Railways as per the findings of the inquiry reports so as to improve the safety aspect over the Indian Railways.

 

For post accident analysis, a Crew Voice & Video Recording System (similar to Black Box provided in airplanes) is developed for recording of crew communication/interaction in loco along with track side view. This system is provided on 05 locomotives for fields trials.

Receipt of proposals for electrification of Railway lines from various States is a continuous process. Ministry of Railways has planned to electrify balance Broad Gauge routes of Indian Railways encompassing all the States. Balance route electrification work have already been sanctioned.

 

No new infrastructure for production of Diesel Locomotives has been proposed by Railways after the decision of 100% electrification in September, 2018. Diesel locomotives that will be manufactured at Diesel Locomotive Factory Marhowra shall be required by Indian Railways for strategic, emergency and certain operational reasons.

                To clear extra rush of passengers during peak season, special events and festivals, Indian Railways, keeping in view the pattern of traffic, operational feasibility and availability of resources, operates special trains including those from Delhi area.   This is an ongoing process. During the period April & May, 2019 Indian Railways have operated 6544 trips of special trains. 

Except restriction in certain trains, elderly women above the age of 58 years are entitled for 50 % concession on basic fare in regular trains. Further, students are also entitled for concession ranging between 25 % to 100 %, on basic fare, in regular trains depending on the type of journey, category of students etc.

Cleanliness is a continuous process and every endeavor is made to keep the coaches in clean condition and to provide hygienic bed roll to the travelling passengers. Cleaning of coaches of trains is done at both ends including mechanized cleaning through professional agencies.  Watering is done at originating station and nominated stations enroute.  Limited mechanized cleaning attention is given to identified trains including cleaning of toilets during their scheduled stoppages enroute at nominated Clean Train Stations. Mechanised laundries have been set up at 61 locations on Indian Railways for improving the quality of washing of bed linen. Regular and random checks are carried out by railway officials for ensuring cleanliness of coaches and bed rolls. 

Provision of catering service (food & drinking water) in trains running as Summer Special is made through static catering units at stations en-route.  These include Catering Stalls, Food Plazas, Fast Food Units etc.  In addition, Water Vending Machines are also opened certain stations.  Passengers can also avail of e-catering services offered by Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). Regular and surprise inspections are conducted by railway officials to check quality of food over Indian Railways.

                Ministry of Railways through various agencies is undertaking techno-economic feasibility studies of Railway stations.  Based on the outcome of these feasibility studies, stations are planned to be taken up for redevelopment in phases, especially the stations located in major cities, pilgrimage centres and important tourist destinations.  The cost of station redevelopment project is to be met by leveraging commercial development of land and air space in and around the stations.  Presently, work of redevelopment is in progress at Gandhinagar(Gujarat) and Habibganj(Bhopal) stations. Contracts for redevelopment have been awarded for Gomtinagar, Charbagh(Lucknow) and Puducherry stations.

The facilities proposed in a redeveloped station include congestion free non-conflicting entry/exit to the station premises, segregation of arrival/departure of passengers, adequate concourse without overcrowding, integration of both sides of the city wherever feasible, integration with other modes of transport systems e.g. Bus, Metro, etc., user friendly international signage, well illuminated circulating area and sufficient provision for drop off, pick up & parking etc.

                Policing on Railways being a State subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains are the statutory responsibility of the State Governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. However, Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP to provide better protection and security of passenger area & passengers. Cases of Indian Penal Code (IPC) crime in Railways are registered and investigated by the concerned Government Railway Police. However, following measures are being taken by the Railways in coordination with Government Railway Police to ensure security of passengers including women passengers:-

 


	On vulnerable and identified routes/sections, 2500 trains (on an average) are escorted by Railway Protection Force daily in addition to 2200 trains escorted by Government Railway Police of different States daily.
	Security Help Line number 182 is made operational over Indian Railways for security related assistance to passengers in distress.
	Through various social media platforms viz. twitter, facebook etc., Railways are in regular touch with passengers including women to enhance security of passengers and to address their security concern.
	Drives are conducted against entry of male passengers into compartments reserved for women passengers and persons apprehended are prosecuted as per law.
	Ladies Special trains running in Metropolitan cities are being escorted by lady RPF personnel. In other trains, where escorts are provided, the train escorting parties have been briefed to keep extra vigil on the lady passengers travelling alone, ladies coaches en-route and at halting stations.
	Surveillance is kept through CCTV cameras, provided at about 453 stations over Indian Railways, to ensure safety and security of passengers. 
	An Integrated Security System (ISS) consisting of surveillance of vulnerable stations through Close Circuit Television Camera Network, Access Control etc. has been sanctioned to improve surveillance mechanism over 202 railway stations. 
	All Railway Stations and passenger carrying trains are planned to be progressively provided with CCTV based surveillance system. 
	Frequent announcements are made through Public Address System to educate passengers to take precautions against theft, snatching, drugging etc. 
	Regular coordination is made with the State Police/GRP authorities at all levels for prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains. 
	 In order to increase representation of women in RPF to the level of 10%, 4517 out of 9739 vacancies notified in the year 2018 were reserved for women. 


 

CCTV cameras have been fitted in around 1300 coaches of 100 Mainline passenger trains. Balance Mainline passenger trains are presently not fitted with CCTV cameras. For left over coaches of passenger trains, work for the existing running (58276 nos.) is sanctioned. In phase-I, 7020 coaches (4620 coaches of premium trains and 2400 coaches of EMUs in Suburban area of Mumbai area) are planned to be equipped with CCTV System. For this, Request For Proposal (RFP)  is floated and due for open on 22.07.2019 by RailTel, a PSU of Ministry of Railways.

However, Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP to provide better protection and security of passenger area & passengers. Cases of Indian Penal Code (IPC) crime in Railways are registered and investigated by the concerned Government Railway Police. However, following measures are being taken by the Railways in coordination with Government Railway Police to ensure security of passengers including women passengers:-

 


	On vulnerable and identified routes/sections, 2500 trains (on an average) are escorted by Railway Protection Force daily in addition to 2200 trains escorted by Government Railway Police of different States daily.
	Security Help Line number 182 is made operational over Indian Railways for security related assistance to passengers in distress.
	Through various social media platforms viz. twitter, facebook etc., Railways are in regular touch with passengers including women to enhance security of passengers and to address their security concern.
	Drives are conducted against entry of male passengers into compartments reserved for women passengers and persons apprehended are prosecuted as per law.
	Ladies Special trains running in Metropolitan cities are being escorted by lady RPF personnel. In other trains, where escorts are provided, the train escorting parties have been briefed to keep extra vigil on the lady passengers travelling alone, ladies coaches en-route and at halting stations.
	Surveillance is kept through CCTV cameras, provided at about 453 stations over Indian Railways, to ensure safety and security of passengers. 
	An Integrated Security System (ISS) consisting of surveillance of vulnerable stations through Close Circuit Television Camera Network, Access Control etc. has been sanctioned to improve surveillance mechanism over 202 railway stations. 
	All Railway Stations and passenger carrying trains are planned to be progressively provided with CCTV based surveillance system. 
	Frequent announcements are made through Public Address System to educate passengers to take precautions against theft, snatching, drugging etc. 
	Regular coordination is made with the State Police/GRP authorities at all levels for prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains. 
	 In order to increase representation of women in RPF to the level of 10%, 4517 out of 9739 vacancies notified in the year 2018 were reserved for women. 


 

CCTV cameras have been fitted in around 1300 coaches of 100 Mainline passenger trains. Balance Mainline passenger trains are presently not fitted with CCTV cameras.

                Modernisation/upgradation of  Railway station in Indian Railways is a continuous and on-going process. This has been undertaken from time to time under various modernization schemes such as Model Station Scheme, Modern Station Scheme and Adarsh Station Scheme.  The ‘Model Station Scheme’ (June, 1999 to November, 2008) and the ‘Modern Station Scheme’ (2006-07 and 2007-08) have since been discontinued.

At present, upgradation of stations is undertaken under Adarsh Station Scheme. Selection of Railway stations under Adarsh Station Scheme is based on the identified need for upgradation of amenities. 1253 stations have been identified for development under Adarsh station Scheme out of which 1103 railway stations have been developed so far and the remaining stations are planned to be developed by 2019-20.

Besides there are other policies initiatives by Indian Railways to provide improved facilities at all stations. 68 stations have been identified for soft upgradation and all 68 stations have been upgraded in the year 2018-19.

Recently, a separate policy has been made for development of stations under Station Redevelopment Programme through Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) on ‘as is where is’ basis. Government has approved Railways’ proposal for redevelopment of railway stations by IRSDC as Nodal Agency, through simplified procedures and for longer lease tenure. Accordingly, all the stations on Indian Railways have been entrusted to IRSDC and other Government agencies for undertaking the techno-economic feasibility studies. Based on the outcome of the feasibility studies, stations are planned to be taken up for redevelopment in phases especially the stations located in major cities, pilgrimage centres and important tourist destinations. Redevelopment of stations is planned though leveraging of commercial development of vacant land/air space in and around stations. Presently, work of redevelopment is in progress at Gandhinagar (Gujrat) and Habibganj (Madhya Pradesh) stations. Contracts for redevelopment have been awarded for Gomtinagar, Charbagh (Uttar Pradesh) and Puducherry (Union Territory of Puducherry ) stations.

Construction and Modernization of all the railway stations in the country is a need based ongoing process subject to commercial justification, operational requirement, technical feasibility and resource availability.

Under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, in the previous government, the thrust on Swachchta has been immense. The results of Swachchta Campaign are discernible. Railways have acted as a game changer as introduction of bio-toilets in the trains has made the length and breadth of the country stench free. Further also, Railways will continue to make efforts in promoting Cleanliness across its network. In promoting Green environment and renewable energy, Railways have taken steps like accelerating electrification at a fast pace and installing solar panels in Railway premises. Railways look forward to continue to collaborate with TERI in seeking environment friendly techniques.” Further, Shri Rajesh Agrawal, Member, Rolling Stock added that the movement “Shift to Rail” is the need of the hour as it will bring a significant drop in logistics transportation cost and it will also enable environment protection.     

On the occasion of Environment Day, “Environmental Sustainability Annual Report 2018-19” of achievements of Environment Management of Indian Railways was released. Best performing Production Unit in the field of environment was awarded to Rail Wheel Factory,Yelahanka. Test launch of Mobile App for On Board House Keeping Services on Important Trains was also held on this occasion.

Railways being a major consumer of energy, systematic programs have been launched towards improving energy efficiency and energy conservation including use of renewable sources of energy and alternative fuels in its energy mix. As part of its initiative for Green Buildings, 8 Production Units and 42 major Workshops are certified to ISO 14001 :  38 Diesel Sheds, 61 Coaching Depots, 21 Freight Depots and 8 Electric Loco Sheds 3 MEMU/ DEMU Car Sheds, 2 Engineering Workshops and 1 Stores Depot have been certified.  Sanitary Napkin Vending Machines and Incinerators are being installed at a number of stations. MOUs have been signed with States for planting of trees on vacant railway land to increase Carbon Sink. Use of plastics of less than 20 micron thickness in packaging is banned.166 Plastic bottle crushing machines have been set up at 128 stations. Apart from focus on Water Recycling Plants and Rain Water Harvesting, a number of old/dead water bodies have been revived. IRCTC has been mandated to install Water Vending Machines (WVM) on stations. 

Indian Railways is a lead signatory to India’s NDC by committing to reduce 20% of fresh water consumption by 2030 and to reduce carbon emission by 32% over the base year 2005 by improving rail traction energy & fuel efficiency. Indian Railway has planned various initiatives to meet its commitment on sustainability.

                 As per Gazette Notification G.S.R. 1361(E), dated 02.11.2017, all vehicles under category M & N, sold after 1st of December 2017 are required to be fitted with FASTag by the manufacturer of the vehicle or its authorized dealer. To make availability widespread and maximizing existing vehicles to affix FASTags, Government has made it mandatory to affix FASTag for issuance of National Permit (N/P). A wide number of banks (22 numbers) have been certified to issue FASTag across the country. Further, bank neutral FASTag “NHAI FASTag” have been launched for easy availability at petrol-pump and on e-commerce site Amazon. By adopting these measures, Government endeavours to increase penetration of FASTag substantially and moving towards 100% cashless.

                The Government vide, G.S.R 490(E) dated 24.05.2018 has notified mass emission standards for flex-fuel Methanol M15 or M100 and Methanol MD 95 vehicles. M-15 is a blend of 15 % methanol and 85 % Gasoline. Use of blended fuel M-15 in BS-IV cars can result in lowering down greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 5 to 10 percent thereby improving air quality. M-15 fuel blending is available as an option and there is no proposal to make such blending mandatory in the near future.

NHs are designed and constructed as per Indian Roads Congress Codes and the Ministry’s relevant Guidelines / Policies. Road Safety measures and provisions are part of the design and construction of NHs. Road Safety audits are also carried out as part of NH development projects on Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) / Build Operate Transfer (BOT) modes. Identification and rectification of road accident black spots, improvements on safety on NHs through Road Safety Annual Plan, taking up of Road Safety audits, installation of crash barriers at accident prone locations in Hilly terrain etc, are taken up to minimize accidents on NHs.

 

Safety of Road Construction Workers and Environmental Protection are also part of design and construction of NHs and these are implemented as per the relevant policies / guidelines and provisions of the Contract / Concession Agreements.

 

The Ministry has promulgated the Green Highways (Plantation, Transplantation, Beautification & Maintenance) Policy, 2015 with regard to planting of trees in place of trees cut due to widening of NHs as per the Statutory conditions by different agencies. Planting of trees in lieu of the cut trees is generally done after substantial completion of Civil construction works to avoid damage to the planted saplings. Like tree cutting, planting is done by different agencies, including the Forest Department, depending upon the requirements of individual project and contractual conditions.

                The total length of National Highways (NHs) across various States and Union Territories (UTs) is about 1,32,500 km at present. The Lane-wise distribution of NHs as on 31.03.2019 is as under:



	
		
			
			Sr. No.
			
			
			Lane configuration of NHs
			
			
			Approx. Length (km)
			
		
		
			
			1.
			
			
			Less than 2-Lane NH standards
			
			
			36,310
			
		
		
			
			2.
			
			
			2-Lane NH standards
			
			
			65,123
			
		
		
			
			3.
			
			
			4-Lane or more NH standards
			
			
			31,067
			
		
	



Development and maintenance of NHs is a continuous process. The works on NHs are accordingly taken up from time to time as per inter-se priority, traffic density and availability of funds to keep the NHs in traffic worthy conditions. 

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways took up development of NHs/ roads under various phases of National Highways Development Project (NHDP), Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for the North East Region (SARDP-NE) including Arunachal Pradesh Package of Roads, Special Programme for Development of Roads in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas, Externally Aided Projects (EAP), National Highways (Original) [NH (O)] scheme, etc. Various phases of NHDP envisaged development of NHs to 4/6 lane and 2 lane NH standards, development of expressways, etc. Development of most of the roads/ NHs under other schemes envisages their upgradation to 2 lane NH standards.

The Ministry had taken up detailed review of NHs network with a view to develop the road connectivity to Border areas, development of Coastal roads including road connectivity for Non-Major ports, improvement in the efficiency of National Corridors, development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes along with integration with Sagarmala, etc., under “Bharatmala Pariyojana”. Under this proposal, the Ministry identified stretches for development of about 26,200 km length of Economic Corridors, 8,000 km of Inter Corridors, 7,500 km of Feeder Routes, 5,300 km Border and International connectivity roads, 4,100 km Coastal and Port connectivity roads, 1,900 km Expressways, National Corridor Efficiency improvement by development of ring roads around 28 cities, decongestion of about 125 choke points and 66 congestion points, development of 35 nos. of Multimodal Logistics Parks. 

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the proposal for investment approval for Phase-I of “Bharatmala Pariyojana” during its meeting held on 24.10.2017. “Bharatmala Pariyojana” Phase–I includes development of about 9,000 km length of Economic corridors, about 6,000 km length of Inter-corridor and feeder roads, about 5,000 km length of National Corridors Efficiency improvements, about 2,000 km length of Border and International connectivity roads, about 2,000 km length of Coastal and port connectivity roads, about 800 km length of Expressways and balance length of about 10,000 km of roads under NHDP. 

The general principle for upgradation of roads under Phase-I of Bharatmala Pariyojana includes development of Economic corridors primarily to 4/6 lane NH standards, Inter-corridor and feeder roads primarily to 4 lane NH standards and Border, International connectivity roads, Coastal and port connectivity roads primarily to 2 lane NH standards.

The programme is targeted for completion in 2021-2022.

                In a move to benefit skilled persons from economically underprivileged sections of the society, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has decided to remove the requirement of minimum educational qualification for driving a transport vehicle. Under Rule 8 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, a transport vehicle driver needs to have passed class 8. However, there are large numbers of unemployed persons especially in rural areas of the country, who may not have a formal education, but are otherwise literate and skilled. In a recent meeting in the Transport Ministry, the Haryana government had requested for waiver of the educational qualification condition for drivers from the economically backward Mewat region where the population is dependent for livelihood on low-income earning pursuits including driving. The state government had submitted that many people in the region possess the required skill but not the required educational qualification, and were finding it difficult to obtain driving license.  Hence it was felt that driving being more a matter of skill than of educational competence, the condition of minimum educational qualification acts as a hindrance for the otherwise eligible unemployed youth. The removal of this requirement will open up employment opportunities for a large number of unemployed persons, especially the youth in the country. 

Not only this, the decision will also help meet the shortage ofnearly 22 lakh drivers in the transport and logistics sector, which is hindering its growth. 

However, while removing the requirement of a minimum educational qualification, the Ministry has strongly emphasized upon training and skill testing of drivers so that road safety is not compromised in any way. Anyone applying for a driving license will have to mandatorily pass a stringent skill test. The Ministry has emphasized that training imparted by a school or establishment as mentioned in the the Motor Vehicels Act 1988 should ensure that the driver can read signs and perform logistical duty such as maintenance of driver logs, inspection of trucks and trailers, submission of pre-trip and post-trip records, determination of discrepancies in paperwork, effective communication to report safety hazards.  Moreover schools and establishments which are providing vocational training and skilling facilities are subject to regulatory control by the states. Hence, the training imparted should be of high quality covering all aspects of driving a particular type of motor vehicle. 

The Ministry had already proposed the removal of requirement for educational qualification in the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill that got passed by the previous Lok Sabha. The subject was also deliberated upon by the Standing Committee and Select committee of the Parliament.  

In light of the above the Ministry of Road Transport & highways has initiated the process of amendment to the Rule 8 of Central Motor Vehicles 1989 and the draft notification in this regard will be issued soon.

The Union Minister of Rural Development, Panchayati Raj, Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar today inaugurated a one day workshop on experience sharing under Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) along with Minister of State for Rural Development Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, Member of Parliament, Robertganj Shri Pakaudi Lal Kol and Secretary, Rural Development Shri Amarjeet Sinha. SPMRM focuses on cluster based integrated development through Geo – spatial Planning for holistic development of the region while encouraging innovation and integrated and inclusive rural development.

Shri Narendra Singh Tomar addressing the gathering asserted that SPMRM would improve the living condition of rural areas. Shri Tomar insisted that SPMRM should draw inspiration from the life of Shyama Prasad Mukherji and bring in development based on his vision of reducing the rural – urban divide. The Minister pointed out that each mission requires funds, however, success of a mission is equally dependent on the mind-set of the community and their ownership. He advised that rural – urban migration would be reduced if we provide employment, education and basic amenities in these clusters. He laid emphasis on the skill development linked with market linkage and insisted on developing theme based clusters which would encourage entrepreneurial skill and buying power of the cluster.

Shri Tomar emphasised that cleanliness plays a pivotal role in providing a hygienic and healthy environment and this should be brought in with the help of community participation and by making it a mass movement. He applauded the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan started by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi as it has helped to improve sanitation in a great way. He informed that as per a study carried out by World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2018 three lakh children were saved from diarrhoea as cleanliness was improved vis-à-vis an earlier study done in 2015. He further insisted that Swachhata Award must be taken up in these clusters.

The Minister of State Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti stated that due to constant effort for ensuring community participation, the rural population is now aware of their rights and that the Sarpanchs act as a link between Government of India and rural population. She insisted that with the well planned development foreseen in the Rurban Cluster, employment would be created which will help reduce rural migration. She also proposed that clusters may be awarded based on their development so that they act as an inspiration for other clusters. She stressed on the need of employment generative skill development.

Member of Parliament Shri Pakodi Lal Kol, appreciated the work being done in their Kodai cluster. He informed that this has improved the basic infrastructure facilities and the cluster which was earlier in the dark has now got well-lit through this program.

The Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development, Shri Amarjeet Sinha appreciated that this workshop is being held where elected representative are sharing their experiences on the development taking place under Rurban Mission in their respective areas. Shri Sinha informed that studies have revealed that rural areas contribute to 50% of agriculture manufacturing goods and contribute one fifth to the service sector and these are mainly the clusters which have more than 75% population engaged in non-farming activities. He further informed that Rurban clusters would witness a well planned development through infused economic activities along with infrastructure development.

Elected representatives from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Mizoram, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Kerala, Nagaland, Karnataka, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh shared their experience. Apart from infrastructural development through the mission, the participants informed that it has also helped in increasing the income of the population through economic activity generation initiatives like Agro – processing, bakery industries, garments manufacturing, e-rickshaw services, agri-equipment bank. Further several states presented their experiences on successful implementation and impact of solid waste management activities. The meeting was attended by more than 275 participants which includes over 80 elected representatives from the States and Union Territories.

                Five Indian seafarers from the vessel ‘MT Apecus’ were kidnapped and taken ashore from the vessel in the outer anchorage off Bonny Island, Nigeria, at around 13.30 GMT (1900 IST) on 19.04.2019.

The Directorate General of Shipping was reported about this incident during early hours on 20.04.2019. Standard Operating Procedures as per the applicable contingency plan was initiated, and various agencies concerned were intimated of the said incident. 

An Inter-Ministerial Group of Officers (IMGO) has been set up by the Government of India, under the Ministry of Shipping, Government of India to deal with potential maritime security situations arising out of any hijacking at sea of merchant's vessels with Indian crew. The IMGO was, therefore, convened to deal with the situation. Ministry of Shipping through the Directorate General of Shipping continuously coordinated with various agencies to work towards the early release of seafarers. Ministry was also in touch with the family members to update them on the developments in a timely manner as well as give necessary support as required.

The High Commission of India, Abuja, Nigeria conveyed the details of the incident to the Nigerian Authorities due to which the Nigerian Navy boarded the vessel to secure the vessel as well as carry out an investigation of the incident.  Also, the Regional Maritime Rescue & Coordination Centre, Nigeria (RMRCC) continued to assist in the matter.   

The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), thereafter took the lead to coordinate Nigerian efforts for securing the release of kidnapped seafarers.   In coordination with the Nigerian Police and Nigerian Navy, NIMASA deployed a team in the area, to try and expedite the safe release of the Indian nationals.  

The Directorate General of Shipping also coordinated with owner of vessel MT Apecus as well as communicated to the Maritime Administration of Greece from where the owner operated its vessels, to coordinate the release of kidnapped seafarers. The Directorate General of Shipping also took up the issue of piracy in the region with the International Maritime Organization and other international fora towards coordinating the efforts for eradication of this menace.

Mandaviya stated that, “I am happy to share that due to the sustained efforts of various stakeholders, including the Ministry of Shipping, the Directorate General of Shipping and the High Commission of India, Abuja, Nigeria, the kidnapped Indian seafarers were successfully released and have reached the safe custody of the authorities on 27.06.2019.”

                Ministry of Shipping signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with IIT Kharagpur today for setting up the Centre for Inland and Coastal Maritime Technology (CICMT) at IIT Kharagpur. The MoA was signed in the presence of Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, Minister of State for Shipping(I/c) and Chemicals & Fertilizers.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Mandaviya said, “Indigenous technology is the need of the hour for the maritime sector, and we are determined to promote Make- In- India as per the vision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.”

Detailing about the state-of-the-art centre which is being set up the under the flagship Sagarmala Programme, Shri Mandaviya said that the project is of strategic long-term interest for the port and maritime sector of the country and will provide tremendous impetus to Inland water transportation and coastal shipping.

“First of its kind, this centre will be a hub for latest technology tools for maritime sector and reduce India’s dependence on foreign institutions. It will also reduce the cost of research drastically and result in cost and time savings for work in the port and maritime sector,” he added.

“Currently, there is no testing and experimentation facility available in the country for inland and coastal vessels for which the shipbuilders have to approach various European countries. The state-of-the-art Centre for Inland and Coastal Maritime Technology (CICMT) is being setup to address this long felt need and to provide impetus to development of inland waterways and coastal shipping in the country,” Shri Mandaviya further added.

On this occasion Director, CICMT, IIT Kharagpur said that with signing of this MoA and further setting up of this centre India will become a key player in ship modal testing facility as only four other countries in the world have this testing facility at present.

The project, costing Rs 69.20 crore, is being funded under the Sagarmala programme. The funding for CICMT is for 5 years after which revenues generated from the end users will make it sustainable.

CICMT at IIT Kharagpur will provide technological support, research, testing and experimentation facility to agencies involved in inland water transport, shipbuilding, ports. etc. The Centre will focus on ship design for coastal/inland waterways, shipbuilding technology and structural design, transport systems & logistics, cryogenic cargo handling, green/renewable energy harvesting from coastal and inland waters and automation and artificial intelligence (AI) for maritime operations.

Setting up of CICMT signifies a major leap in indigenous innovation and cutting edge technology support to the port and maritime sector directly contributing to the Sagarmala programme  and  is based on close collaboration amongst government, academic institutions and industry to make applied research relevant to day to day ground work in the port and maritime sector.

                The Minister of State (I/C) for Shipping Shri Mansukh Mandaviya inspected the Sonia Vihar site of the proposed Yamuna Water Taxi Project of Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) in New Delhi today. IWAI proposes to develop River Yamuna in Delhi for the purpose of tourism in a sustainable way. 

 

Speaking at the project site Shri Mandaviya said that the Yamuna Water Taxi Project will be a new means of urban transportation. It will not only give a boost to tourism but will also help reduce traffic congestion in the city.

The project covers a total length of 16 km and comprises five locations on the banks of River Yamuna in Delhi, including Fatepur Jat, Tronica City, Jagatpur, Sonia Vihar and Wazirabad. It is proposed to be developed in two phases – Pase I: Sonia Vihar to Tronica City and Phase II: Wazirabad to Sonia Vihar and Tronica City to Fatehpur Jat. 

 

The project also proposes to operate vessels on multi-fuel sources on the river, making it more environment friendly. 

 

During site inspection, Shri Mandaviya was accompanied by Chairman- IWAI, Member (Tech), Chief Engineer - IWAI, Chief Engineer - Delhi Tourism and officials of Irrigation Department of Delhi Government.

                Shipping sector witnesses  an unprecedented growth of 35 % in employment of Indian Seafarers

On the occasion of the International Day of the Seafarerstoday, the Union Minister of State (I/C) for Shipping Shri Mansukh Mandaviyareiterated the Government’s commitment towardsproviding an enabling environment for the growth of seafarers in India. In a message on the occasion the Minister said “Seafarers are unsung heroes of Shipping, the industry on which everyone, everywhere relies for the goods we all need and want.”The Minister also said , “The Government of India is committed to provide an enabling environment for growth of seafarers from India.”

“The shipping sector has witnessed an unprecedented growth of 35 per cent in the number of Indian seafarers employed on Indian or foreign flag vessels this year. The figure rose from 154349 in 2017 to 208799 in 2018. The number has doubled since 2013, when it was just 1,03,835”, he said

He further stated that this phenomenal growth in the number of Indian seafarers has been possible due to a series of measures taken by the Government during the last four years to improve the standards of maritime training, increase on-board training opportunities, improve the examination and certification system and facilitate ease of doing business.

“While India has created a large capacity in imparting class-room training for Merchant Navy, there was a major constraint in providing on-board ship training for the students enrolled for class room training. However, I am glad to state that the number of students placed for on-board training has increased from 14307 last year to 19545 this year, showing a jump of nearly 37 per cent”, he said. 

Shri Mandaviya informed that the training curriculum for the officers and the ratings were revised in 2016 not only to meet the global standards but also to meet the expectations of the foreign employers. 

To regulate the training institutes working in private sector, a system of ‘Comprehensive Inspection Programme’ (CIP) was designed to assess the quality of the institute on various parameters such as infrastructure, quality of students’ intake, quality of faculty, pedagogy, performance in examination, on-board training and placement of students.An e-learning module was prepared to standardize the course material of these institutes and provided free of cost to all Indian seafarers to allow them to upgrade their knowledge and skills before appearing for the examination. To ensure increase in the supply side, a 15-year-old ban on setting up of new training institutes or increasing the capacity of the existing training institutes was lifted with certain conditions. 

In addition to these, major regulatory relaxation was made in 2017 for obtaining Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC). CDC is an identity document for a seafarer. The CDC process has also been made online. DG shipping has issued more than 70,000 CDCs under new CDC rule in 2018.

                The V.O. Chidambaranar Port Trust, Tuticorin and Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding todayfor facilitating Direct Port Entry (DPE) of e-sealed factory stuffed export container tothe port under ‘Ease of Doing Business’.

With this MoU, Central Warehousing Corporation would make use of the 18,357 sqm area earmarked in the Truck Parking Terminal located opposite to Fisheries College, Tuticorin for operating and managing the DPE facility for 30 years on Annual Lease Rental basis. The Direct Port Entry (DPE) facility would enable direct movement of containers from factories without intermediate handling requirement at any Container Freight Station thus facilitating the shippers to gate-in their factory-stuffed goods directly to the Container Terminal on 24 x 7 basis.

At present, the factory stuffed (self-sealed) containers are taken to 15 Container Freight Stations (CFSs) and one ICD operated in Tuticorin. All the CFSs operate during the day time from 10 AM to 5 PM with extended time upto 8 PM on working days. Only one CFS operated by CONCOR has 24x7 service. Hence, with this DPE facility made available by the port at the Truck Parking Terminal, the export clearance of factory stuffed e-sealed containers will be faster and the time and cost incurred will get reduced.



MoU signed by Shri T.K. Ramachandran, Chairman, V.O. Chidambaranar Port Trust and 

Shri Arun Kumar Shrivastava,Managing Director, Central Warehousing

                The Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has notified a non-statutory regulatory body, the National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET), through a Government Notification dated 05.12.2018. The NCVET will merge the functions of National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT) and National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) and will regulate the functioning of entities engaged in vocational education and training, both long-term and short-term, and establish minimum standards for the functioning of such entities.

The primary functions of NCVET will include – recognition and regulation of awarding bodies, assessment bodies and skill related information providers; approval of qualifications developed by awarding bodies and Sector Skill Councils (SSCs); indirect regulation of vocational training institutes through awarding bodies and assessment agencies; research and information dissemination; grievance redressal.

This institutional reform will lead to improvement in quality and market relevance of skill development programs lending credibility to vocational education and training encouraging greater private investment and employer participation in the skills space. 

Being a regulator of India’s skill ecosystem, NCVET will have a positive impact on each individual who is a part of vocational education and training in the country. The idea of skill-based education will be seen in a more inspirational manner which would further encourage students to apply for skill-based educational courses. This is also expected to facilitate the ease of doing business by providing a steady supply of skilled workforce to the industry and services.

This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri. R. K. Singh in  the Rajya Sabha today.

                           Under the Skill India Mission, there are about 20 Central Ministries/Departments including Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) involved in the implementation of more than 40 schemes for various skill development programmes to enhance the employment opportunities of the youth.

As on 12.06.2019, 52.12 lakh (appx.) (31.08 lakh STT + 21.04 lakh RPL) candidates have been trained under the scheme in the country.

 

Under PMKVY 2016-20, focus on employment has been significantly enhanced and candidates have been placed in various sectors and industries. Training Centers (TCs)/ Training Providers (TPs) are required to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells for industry linkage and placement of candidates. TPs are mandated to organize Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) and to ensure the participation of local industry. Scheme also incentivizes TCs/TPs for facilitating placement of the trained candidates. Further, the reimbursement of last 20% of training payout to TCs is linked with the placement (wage employment or self employment) of the candidate. Additionally, post placement support of Rs. 1500 per month per trainee is applicable for special group (women candidates and persons with disability) and special areas (LWE, North East region and J&K) for 2 or 3 month post training depending on placement within or outside the district of the domicile of the candidate.

 

Due to the above mentioned initiatives, the reported placement under PMKVY 2016-20 is approximately 57%. Further, the third party impact evaluation of PMKVY 2016-20, conducted by independent body, has observed that 17% of the students enrolled under PMKVY 2016-20 prefer to go for higher studies than getting into employment. 

 

Ministry has also undertaken various measures to encourage greater participation of industry in skilling ecosystem to improve employment outcomes. Employer led skill development is also being promoted to further improve placements rates under PMKVY 2016-20. 

 

Under STT, the placement data is reported within 90 days of certification of trained candidate. As per data reported on SDMS (Skill Development Management System), as on 12.06.2019, 24.56 lakh candidates are certified under STT of PMKVY 2016-20. The number of candidates certified under STT of PMKVY 90 days prior i.e. 12.03.2019 is 21.97 lakh. Out of these candidates, as on 12.06.2019, 12.6 lakh candidates have been reported to be placed in various sectors across the country.

                The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment organized a national level function here today on the occasion of the “International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking” to generate public awareness about the ill-effects of drug abuse and launched a campaign to fight against the drug abuse.  Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, the Vice President of India was the Chief Guest and Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, the Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, presided over the function. Ministers of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, Shri Ram Das Athawale, Shri Rattan Lal Kataria, Secretary, M/o SJ&E Ms. Nilam Sawhney and many dignitaries were present.

The Vice President of India as Chief Guest in his speech said that drug abuse is global challenge even the developed nations find difficult to encounter. Since the abuse of drugs can afflict persons of any age group and the youngsters, especially teenagers and the neo-youth are particularly vulnerable to fall victims to the drug mafia, the Government and the civil society both have an onerous responsibility to ensure that they, the potential victims, are made aware of the perils of drug abuse and to make them immune to the temptation of drugs. The magnitude of the challenge posed by alcoholism and drug abuse is so huge that any effort of the Governmental agencies, however concerted it may be, will not alone suffice to contain the peril. The State Government, Non-Governmental Organizations and dedicated individuals also have a great responsibility at hand, to achieve the end of this menace.

He opined that the magnitude of the challenge posed by drug abuse is so huge that efforts of the Governmental agencies alone will not suffice. The NGOs and other dedicated individuals also have a great responsibility in eradicating this menace.

Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, in his speech, mentioned that the Ministry has also identified some high risk districts which require special attention in order to increase community participation and public cooperation in the reduction of demand for dependence-producing substances. These programmes include Community Based Peer Led Intervention for early Drug Use Prevention among Adolescents and Youth and Outreach and Drop in Centres. Through these programmes, youth would be trained as Peer Educators to lead peer led community intervention and implement early prevention education especially for vulnerable adolescents and youth in the community.

Shri Rattan Lal Kataria, Minister of State for Social Justice & Empowerment, in his welcome address, highlighted the importance of the Day and the efforts made by the Ministry in this regard.   He stated that Alcohol and drug abuse has emerged as a serious concern in India. Addiction to drugs and alcohol not only affects the individuals involved but also disrupts the family and society at large. The menace of drug abuse among the younger generation has been rising all over the world and India is no exception. With the support of like minded organizations such as Regional Rehabilitation Centre, Non- Governmental Organisations, State Governments, Media etc., we will be able to curb this social problem.

Ms. Nilam Sawhney, Secretary, in her address thanked the Vice President of India for his gracious presence on the occasion and said that his association with this cause will act as a great source of encouragement to the persons and Institutions working in the field of drug abuse and drug demand reduction. She also thanked the Union Minister of SJ&E under whose able leadership and unflinching commitment, the Ministry has taken several initiatives for drug demand reduction including holding this function. 

Ms. Rashmi Chowdhary, Joint Secretary, M/o SJ&E presented a Report on “The National Survey on Extent and Pattern of Substance Use” and “National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction (NAPDDR)”.  Both these initiatives of the Government of India have been taken in the backdrop of a substantial increase in the substance use amongst the younger population, with more people initiating substance user from an early age. Accurate knowledge on the extent and pattern of substance use in India is a significant first step to address this serious social health problem in India. 

Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment observes 26th June every year as “International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking”. It is the nodal Ministry for drug demand reduction. It coordinates and monitors all aspects of drug abuse prevention which include assessment of the extent of the problem, preventive action, treatment and rehabilitation of addicts, dissemination of information and public awareness. The Ministry provides community based services for the identification, treatment and rehabilitation of addicts through Voluntary Organizations. The Ministry provides financial assistance to NGOs across the country for running de-addiction centres. The Ministry has also set up a 24x7 National Toll Free drug de-addiction helpline number 1800110031 to help the victims of drug abuse, their family and society at large.

	To examine issues arising from the implementation of the OM dated 08.09.1993 and to revisit the criteria evolved by the Expert Committee (Prasad Committee) and thereafter to give recommendations for redefining, simplifying and streamlining the concept of creamy layer while keeping in view the observations of the Supreme Court in the Indra Sawhney case.

	III. To examine the issue of candidates of Civil Services Examination where cases have not been settled.


 


	IV. To examine and recommend whether the Certificates of Equivalence issued by State Governments in respect of posts and services under the instrumentalities controlled by the State Government should be accepted for applying the test of equivalence for comparability vis-a-vis State Governments posts while applying the exclusion criterion of creamy layer; if so, then recommend modalities for issuing such Equivalence Certificates with adequate safeguards and level of authorities of State Government for approving such Certificates.


 


	To examine the specific cases of candidates, who had submitted Equivalence Certificates from various authorities of States, which were not considered in absence of a policy in this regard in the Civil Services Examination 2017 and to make specific recommendation on each case, whether to accept the Equivalence Certificate, in consultation with the authorities of the concerned State Governments to satisfy about the veracity of such certificates.


 


	VI. Any other matter that is referred to the Committee by the Competent Authority.


 

The report of the Committee is likely to be received soon.

                The Registrar General of India (RGI), during Enumeration of Census 2011, for the first time provided three codes i.e. Male-1, Female –2 and others -3 for enumeration. This was at the discretion of the respondent. In case the respondent wished to record neither '1' nor '2', then enumerator was instructed to record sex as 'other' and give code '3'. It is important to note that the Census of India does not collect any data specifically on 'transgender'. Thus, the category of 'other' would not only include 'transgender' but also any person who desires to record sex under the category of 'other'. It is also possible that some transgenders would have returned themselves either male or female depending upon their choice. The population of 'other' as per Census 2011 is 4,87,803.

 

An Expert Committee was constituted in the Ministry to make an in-depth study of the problems being faced by the Transgender Community and suggest suitable measures to ameliorate their conditions. The Committee submitted its report on 27th January 2014.  The Committee in its report has observed that the transgender community is a highly marginalized and vulnerable one and is seriously lagging behind on human development indices mainly in the area of education and employment.       

 

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its Judgment dated 15.04.2014 in WP(C) 400/2012 (NLSA Vs. UOI) directed, inter-alia, the Centre and State Governments to take steps to treat Transgenders as socially and educationally backward classes of citizens and extend all kinds of reservation in cases of admission in educational institutions and for public appointments.

 

In order to provide for protection of rights of transgender persons and their welfare, the Ministry introduced a Bill titled ""The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016"" in the Lok Sabha on 2.8.2016, the Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 17.12.2018.

                The Registrar General of India (RGI), during Enumeration of Census 2011, for the first time provided three code i.e. Male-1, Female-2 and other-3 for enumeration. This was at the discretion of the respondent. In case the respondent wished to record neither ‘1’ nor ‘2’ then enumerator was instructed to record sex as ‘other’ and give code ‘3’. It is important to note that the Census of India does not collect any data specifically on ‘transgender’. Thus, the category of ‘other’ would not only include ‘transgender’ but also any person who desires to record sex under the category of ‘other’. It is also possible that some transgender would have returned themselves either male or female depending upon their choice. The population of ‘other’ as per Census 2011 is 4,87,803. 

The details of funds allocated during the last three years is as under:

                NDA Government led by the Prime Minister Modi is committed to all round development of the people from different walks of life. In keeping with this spirit and the need to have equitable distribution of benefit amongst the OBC Castes/Communities, a Commission was set up under article 340 of the Constitution to examine the issue of sub-categorization within Other Backward Classes in the Central list.

Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has accorded ex-post facto approval for the extension of the term of the Commission to examine the issue of Sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes, by two more months i.e. upto 31st July 2019.

          This is the sixth extension to the commission whose term would have expired on May 31, 2019.

Impact:

The extension of the tenure of the commission would enable it to evaluate the issue of Sub-categorization of OBC’s in the Central list based on wider consultations with various stakeholders. It will enable the commission to submit a comprehensive report on the issue. 

Background:

The Commission was constituted under article 340 of the Constitution with the approval of President on 2nd October, 2017. The Commission, headed by Justice (Retd.) Smt. G. Rohini commenced functioning in October, 2017 and has since interacted with all the Stats/UTs which have subcategorized OBCs, and the State Backward Classes Commissions. The Commission has come to the view that it would be appropriate to have a detailed consultation with the States/UTs in the light of the response received with respect to for the Consultation Papers issued by the ""Commission"" earlier. This is essential to ensure that no community is put in a grossly undeserving position and this process is likely to take a couple of months. 

In view of this fact, the Commission has sought extension of its term by two more months, i.e. upto 31st July 2019 which has been approved by the commission.

                This Ministry has launched a new regular employment-unemployment survey, namely, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) during April, 2017 with certain changes in survey methodology, data collection mechanism and sampling design vis-à-vis the earlier quinquennial (once in every five years) Employment and Unemployment surveys of NSSO. The PLFS has been launched with an objective of measuring quarterly changes of various labour market statistical indicators in urban areas as well as generating annual estimates of these indicators both for rural and urban areas, which can be used for policy making. 

 

The unemployment rates in usual status separately for males and females in rural and urban areas as per the Annual Report on PLFS (July, 2017- June, 2018) are as under: 



	
		
			
			All-India
			
		
		
			
			Sector
			
			
			Male
			
			
			Female
			
		
		
			
			Rural
			
			
			5.8
			
			
			3.8
			
		
		
			
			Urban
			
			
			7.1
			
			
			10.8
			
		
	



 

Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) run by Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) scheme run by Ministry of Rural Development and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) run by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. The Government has also recently constituted Cabinet Committee on Employment & Skill Development among others.

This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Planning, Shri Rao Inderjit Singh in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

Reports have appeared in a section of media citing Dr Arvind Subramanian as regards overestimation of India’s GDP growth, primarily based on an analysis of indicators, like electricity consumption, two-wheeler sales, commercial vehicle sales etc using an econometric model and associated assumptions. 

 

The  Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation has released details from time to time to explain the complexities involved in GDP compilation. The estimation of GDP in any economy is a complex exercise where several measures and metrics are evolved to better measure the performance of the economy. For the purpose of global standardization and comparability, countries follow the System of National Accounts evolved in the UN after elaborate consultation. The System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA) is the latest version of the international statistical standard for the national accounts, adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) in 2009 and is an update of the earlier 1993 SNA. The Inter-Secretariat Working Group on National Accounts (ISWGNA) was mandated to develop the 2008 SNA through intense discussions and consultation with member countries. India also participated in the deliberations of the Advisory Expert Group. In its adoption of the 2008 SNA the UNSC encouraged Member States, regional and sub-regional organizations to implement its recommendations and use it for the national and international reporting of national accounts statistics based on the available data sources.  

 

As with any international standard, the data requirements are immense and diverse economies like India take time to evolve the relevant data sources before they can be fully aligned with the SNA requirements. In absence of data, alternate proxy sources or statistical surveys are used to estimate the contribution of various sectors to the GDP/GVA. The SNA also prescribes that the base year of the estimates may be revised at periodic intervals so that changes in the economic environment, advances in methodological research and the needs of users are appropriately captured. 

 

With structural changes taking place in the economy, it is necessary to revise the base year of macroeconomic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Index of Industrial Production (IIP), Consumer Price Index (CPI) etc, periodically to ensure that indicators remain relevant and reflect the structural changes more realistically. Such revisions not only use latest data from censuses and surveys, they also incorporate information from administrative data that have become more robust over time.  In India, the Base Year of the GDP Series was revised from 2004-05 to 2011-12 and released on 30 January, 2015 after adaptation of the sources and methods in line with the SNA 2008. The methodology of compilation of macro aggregates has been discussed in detail by the Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS) comprising experts from academia, National Statistical Commission, Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Ministries of Finance, Corporate Affairs, Agriculture, NITI Aayog and selected State Governments. It may be noted that decisions taken by these Committees are unanimous and collective after taking into consideration the data availability and methodological aspects before recommending the most appropriate approach. 

 

In addition, India has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and an Advance Release Calendar is decided for release of estimates. The IMF had raised certain issues on the usage of double deflation in the Indian GDP series and India had informed IMF that the existing data availability does not permit its application in India at present.  In fact, some media reports, while citing the changes in GDP growth likely to result from adopting the double deflation, acknowledges the varying outcomes obtained by different authors under their own distinct assumptions. In view of these divergent views, the Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS) had not agreed to adoption of double deflation at this stage. Moreover, double deflation is used in only a few countries that have a Producers Price Index (PPI) to deflate the inputs. 

 

According to the World Bank, the accuracy of national accounts estimates and their comparability across countries depend on timely revisions to data on GDP and its components. The frequency of revisions to GDP data across countries varies between monthly, quarterly, annually or even less frequently. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), through its technical missions also reviews the implementation of recommendations of SNA and provides necessary technical support. Further, under Article IV of IMF, a Mission, interacts annually with officials of Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, Reserve Bank of India and Ministry of Finance on issues relating to economic development and policies. The detailed methodology for compilation of the GDP, including the Back Series is available on the website of the Ministry. It may also be noted that the National Accounts Division, which compiles these macro aggregates and other National Accounts Statistics is also ISO (International Organisation for Standards) 9001:2015 certified for its quality management of procedures and processes.

 

With any Base Revision, as new and more regular data sources become available, it is important to note that a comparison of the old and new series are not amenable to simplistic macro-econometric modelling. It may also be seen that the GDP growth projections brought out by various national and international agencies are broadly in line with the estimates released by MOSPI. The GDP estimates released by the Ministry are based on accepted procedures, methodologies and available data and objectively measure the contribution of various sectors in the economy.

	Reports have appeared in a section of media regarding the statistical reforms being undertaken in the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) and on the existing GDP series. 


 


	In so far as the statistical reforms are concerned, it is important to note that system reforms are an ongoing process and are necessary for ensuring responsiveness to the changing needs of society. Over a period of time, there have been increasing demands on the statistical system for production of relevant and quality statistics. The Ministry has been accommodating these demands by optimising the available resources and use of technology. As in any system, the advent of technology necessitates reforms in statistical processes and products with an aim to synergise the existing resources so that the system remains responsive. The recent step for the merger of CSO and NSSO was aimed at leveraging the strengths of the two organisations so that it can meet the increasing demands. 


 


	In 2018, the Cabinet had approved several new activities including the conduct of new surveys on the Annual Survey of Services Sector (for a more elaborate coverage of the services sector), Annual Survey of Unincorporated Enterprises (to get a better understanding of these enterprises, primarily in the informal sector), Time Use Survey (for assessing the time disposition of household members) and the Economic Census of all establishments. All these activities require significant financial and human resources which take time to become available. The immediate requirement of manpower can be addressed through a judicious mix of redeployment of existing manpower resources and outsourcing to professional manpower agencies. The outsourced field staff has also to be rigorously trained before deployment and thereafter effectively monitored. This model is being implemented in the Economic Census and other NSS Surveys. In the last Economic Census conducted in 2013, the State Governments were requested to arrange for staff to conduct the field work, which led to delays in finalising and releasing the results. In the ongoing Economic Census, 2019, MoSPI has partnered with the Common Service Centres (CSC) SPV to undertake the field work, and the officers of National Sample Survey (NSS), State Governments and line Ministries will be involved in close monitoring and supervision of the field work to ensure data quality and good coverage. This is the first time that the rigours of monitoring and supervision of field work exercised in NSS will be leveraged for the Economic Census so that results of better quality would be available for creation of a National Statistical Business Register. This process has been catalysed by the establishment of a unified National Statistical Office (NSO). 


 


	In the various media reports regarding the restructuring, what has been missed out, in particular, is the fact that MoSPI is giving an increased focus on Data Quality and Assurance by repositioning the existing data processing personnel. The traditional data processing activity required transformation in light of the adoption of Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) and e-schedule technology in NSS. The latter facilitates better and more reliable data capture with in-built validation checks. These changes require re-skilling of the existing data processing personnel so that they can perform the data quality assurance functions. An emphasis is also being given to more use of administrative data sets that have evolved or are evolving, after ensuring their quality and usability in the statistical system. 


 


	In so far as the credibility of data is concerned, the Government of India adopted the United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (FPOS) in May, 2016. The Government is thus committed to ensure and secure the autonomy and independence of the statistical system to produce appropriate and reliable data by adhering to internationally agreed professional and scientific standards. In the Indian context, there have been a series of expert committees constituted in the past, which made several recommendations for improving the functioning of the national statistical system. The reforms being undertaken in MoSPI are in consonance with these principles as also the various recommendations of the National Statistical Commission (NSC). In fact, the Ministry had drafted the National Policy on Official Statistics (NPOS) and placed the same in the public domain. Based on the comments received, this policy is being redrafted. 


 


	The order issued on 23rd May, 2019 aimed at a unified NSO, as prevailing in most other countries, that produces reliable and quality statistical products by leveraging the synergies available within MoSPI. It may also be mentioned that the Government had merged the post of Chief Statistician of India (CSI) and Secretary, MoSPI to head the NSO and order of 23 May, 2019 on restructuring has since been accordingly clarified.


 


	The Chairman and Members of the NSC are senior functionaries and are entrusted with the responsibility of improving the national statistical system,  and the Ministry duly takes into consideration their recommendations and inputs. The status, role and functions of NSC continue as earlier (Press Release of 31 May, 2019 refers). Efforts are also on to evolve a legislative framework under which the NSC may function with independence and give holistic guidance for improving the national statistical system encompassing MoSPI, the line Ministries and the State Governments. 


 


	In so far as the GDP series are concerned, the Ministry had issued several clarifications, which need to be duly considered for an informed and  balanced view to emerge. In fact, the detailed methodology and approach for the GDP series (new series and back series), are available in the public domain. The detailed Press Release of 30th May, 2019 explained the coverage of the MCA corporate data in the GDP estimates vis-à-vis the NSS (74th Round) Technical Report on services sector with a view to address issues raised in the media on the usage of MCA data. It was explained that the NSS had been conducted this survey to understand the challenges likely to emerge when the Annual Survey of Services Sector is undertaken. The findings were analysed at the macro level and it was noted that majority of the companies had filed their statutory on-line returns with MCA and were not missed out in the GDP estimation. The issue of misclassification was also explained in that the Corporate Identification Number (CIN) has the National Industrial Classification Code embedded which is usually not updated even if a company changes its activity declared at the time of its registration. Before MoSPI undertakes the Annual Survey on Services Sector, these limitations will be duly factored and incorporated in the survey design methodology. These findings will also be used when the GDP series is revised to a new base. 


 


	It needs to be appreciated that GDP estimation is a complex exercise and is undertaken in an ecosystem of incomplete data. This necessitates complex simulations and statistical assumptions before a methodological approach is finalised in consultation with subject experts. In fact, many of the critics of the current GDP series were involved in the various Committees that deliberated and finalised the 2011-12base revision methodology. It may be noted that the decisions of these Committees were unanimous and collective, and were arrived at after taking into consideration the data availability and methodological aspects before being recommended as the most appropriate approach. The Ministry has conventionally involved a wide range of professional experts in its deliberations and the national statistical system has immensely benefitted from their contributions. In addition, India has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and an Advance Release Calendar is decided for release of estimates. The IMF had raised certain issues on the usage of double deflation in the Indian GDP series and India has informed IMF that the existing data availability does not permit its application in India at present.  In fact, the media reports, while citing the changes in GDP growth likely to result from adopting the double deflation, realise the varying outcomes obtained by different authors from their own distinct assumptions. It was because of such views that the Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS) had not agreed to the use of the double deflation at present stage. Moreover, double deflation is used in only a few countries that have a Producers Price Index (PPI) to deflate the inputs. MoSPI is working closely with Ministry of Commerce and Industry to have the methodology for the PPI finalised. 


 


	Further, revision in GDP estimates occur when data coverage from administrative sources improves over time and these improvement get well documented. Consequently, the initial estimates of GDP tend to be conservative. To improve this, it would require concomitant changes in the sectoral data flows and associated regulatory framework in the data source agencies to facilitate use of more macro modelling techniques. The Ministry is also proposing to establish a National Data Warehouse on Official Statistics, where technology will be leveraged for using Big Data Analytical tools for further improving the quality of macro-economic aggregates. As all these reforms are an ongoing process, it is important that the readers and users understand and appreciate the limitations of data and the challenges in estimation. While undertaking these reforms, it is important to realise that newer data sets and survey results will invariably be used and it would be incorrect to comment that old processes were better than the new. The reforms being undertaken in MoSPI will lead to better data sets and better estimates in future, and will be duly deliberated on by the ACNAS during the Base Year revision.


 


	This is also to clarify on the apparent misconception that in the current GDP series the informal manufacturing sector grew at the same rate as the formal manufacturing sector measured by the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI). In fact, it is only the growth of appropriate type of enterprises in ASI (i.e. proprietary, partnership, HUF) that is used to move the bench mark estimates of the informal/unorganized manufacturing segment, and not the growth of the entire ASI. Moreover, while using the Paid-Up-Capital based scaling up of sample results, MOSPI now uses the much larger MCA database (about 7 lakh active corporates) whereas the results from a sample of only 2,500 corporates analysed by RBI were used in the earlier GDP series.


 


	The national statistical system works in an ecosystem of independence and autonomy in its statistical processes. Allusions to any external influence are altogether unwarranted. It has been the endeavour of the Ministry to continue educating users on the various statistical products and processes, which are essentially public goods. In this direction, the Ministry is now making available all primary data collected to the public free of cost. In so far as sharing the external secondary and administrative datasets are concerned, these are governed by various legislations and the researchers may approach the concerned custodian source agencies for more granular data.

                Preparations for 7th Economic Census are underway.  In the run up to the field work to be undertaken by the enumerators across the country, several activities have been planned by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation. Training of trainers at state level is an integral component of this massive exercise.   

Carrying the momentum forward, a Workshop for State Level Training of Trainers on 7th Economic Census for NCT of Delhi has been organized tomorrow on 6th June 2019 at Silver Oak Conference Room, India Habitat Centre in the national capital.. 

The training program for state level trainers in Karnataka, Kerala and Goa will be held on 7th June while for Madhya Pradesh it is scheduled on 10th June. The training workshop for Tamilnadu will be held on 11th June while for  Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep it  has been scheduled on  12 th June. 

In the National Workshop held on 14th May, 2019, the participants (Master Trainers) were trained on the key concepts and definitions, processes, digital platform and application to be used for the enumeration (data capture and supervision) in the field. This is being followed by State and District level detailed training.

About Economic Census

Economic Census is the complete count of all establishment located within the geographical boundary of India. The Economic Census provides disaggregated information on various operational and structural variables of all establishments of the country. Economic Census also provides valuable insight into geographical spread/clusters of economic activities, ownership pattern, persons engaged, etc. of all economic establishments in the country. The information collected during Economic Census are useful for socio-economic developmental planning at state and district levels. Economic Census provides an updated sampling frame for follow- up enterprise surveys undertaken for detailed and comprehensive analysis of all establishments in the country.

Economic Census-2019

The Seventh Economic Census (7th EC) is being conducted by Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) in 2019. In the current Economic Census, MoSPI has partnered with CSC e-Governance Services India Limited, a Special Purpose Vehicle under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology as the implementing agency for 7th EC. In the 7th EC, an IT based digital platform for data capture, validation, report generation and dissemination will be used. The fieldwork for the 7th EC is likely to commence by the end of June 2019 or next month. The results of the exercise will be made available after verification and validation of the field work.

Economic Census will cover all establishments including household enterprises, engaged in production or distribution of goods/services (other than for the sole purpose of own consumption) in non-farm agricultural and non-agricultural sector will be counted. The coverage is same as the one in 6th Economic Census, conducted in 2013.

Previous Economic Censuses

Six Economic Censuses, (EC) have been conducted by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation. till date. The first Economic Census was undertaken in 1977. The Second EC was carried out in 1980 followed by the Third EC in 1990. The fourth edition took place in 1998 while the fifth EC was held in 2005. The Sixth edition of Economic Census was conducted in 2013.

                Export incentive schemes of Ministry of Commerce & Industry are aimed at incentivising merchandise exports including steel. Over the last three years, steel imports from China have come down from 2.163 Million MT to 1.562 Million MT.  This is a result of imposition of Antidumping and Countervailing measures on Chinese steel imports.

Steel being a deregulated sector, specific decision on recruitment of employees in private steel sector is taken by individual steel companies/investors on the basis of their requirement. In the case of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), Steel PSUs, in the last three years and current year regular employment to about 4067 people have been provided.

This Information was given by the Union Minister for  Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.

Commerce & Industry and Railways Minister & Steel Minister Meeting Steel Manufacturers Association

Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways and Steel Minister discussed the challenges being faced by the steel sector and the import-export trends with steel producers in New Delhi today.

Both the Ministers assured the steel industry that Ministries of Commerce& Industry and Steel will make all efforts to ensure that engineering goods exports double in the next 5 years and reach USD 200 billion by 2030.

This will not only boost India’s exports but will also generate jobs in the manufacturing sector especially the MSME sector.

Although India is the second largest manufacturers of steel but India is also a net importer of steel. Representatives of the steel industry and the Engineering Export Councils discussed in detail with Commerce and Steel Ministers the protectionist measures being imposed by other countries and the under-utilised capacity in steel manufacturing in India.

Piyush Goyal and Dharmendra Pradhan discussed at length the measures that both Commerce and Industry and Steel Ministry may take, both tariff and non-tariff, to reduce unnecessary imports and boost exports. 

The MSME sector steel manufacturers urged steel producers to supply raw material at concessional prices so that the MSME sector can compete in international markets. 

The meeting was attended by Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, Faggansingh Kulaste, MoS Steel, Secretary Steel, Binoy Kumar, Secretary Commerce, Anup Wadhawan, DGFT, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi, senior officers of Department of Commerce and Steel Ministry, Chairman SAIL, all members of EEPCs, Indian Steel Association, steel makers and manufacturers and other associations of the steel sector.

                To encourage the domestic apparel sector to compete with multinational brands, Government announced key reforms under a Special Package that includes additional incentives under the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund (ATUFS), relaxation of Section 80JJAA of Income Tax Act and introduction of fixed term employment for the apparel sector. Under Pradhan MantriRojgarProtsahanYojana (PMRPY), Government is providing entire 12% of employer’s contribution towards Employee’s Provident Fund (EPF) and Employee’s Pension Scheme (EPS). Further, to make the apparel sector competitive, Government is providing rebate of State and Central taxes/ levies embedded in manufacturing.

India’s traditional textiles and synthetic materials cater to different domestic market segments. Traditional textiles and fabric are primarily cotton focused and cater to niche markets.In India, import of synthetic fabric is approximately 30% of domestic production of traditional textiles.

Share of imported apparelwith respect to domestic apparel market in Indiais nearly 1.4%.

                A workshop to flag the 100 days’ plan for implementation of the Van Dhan Scheme was organised by TRIFED of Ministry of Tribal Affiars in New Delhi yesterday. The workshop was inaugurated and chaired by Minister for Tribal Affairs, Shri Arjun Munda. Minister of State for Tribal Affairs, Smt Renuka Singh was also present on the occasion. The Van Dhan program workshop was organised for training of implementing teams of Van Dhan Yojana.

 

Shri Arjun Munda appreciated the efforts of TRIFED team for the successful launch and acknowledged that the team’s efforts have been channelized in the right direction and were contributing significantly to the cause of tribal livelihood and income enhancement. 

 

The Minister emphasised that the Tribal groups are the rightful owners of the Minor Forest Produce (MFP) and we are only helping them claim their rightful value for the forest produce. The tribal groups are the guardians of some of the most important natural resources, like forest, rivers, and minerals, he said. Despite such invaluable efforts by the tribal community, they are still amongst the most deprived communities and it is the government’s duty to support them in their efforts. He advised the team to work with utmost passion for making an impact on the ground through successful implementation of the scheme.  Shri Arjun Munda emphasized on the importance of networking and collaborating with stakeholders from public and private sectors to ensure maximum outreach for the scheme.  He advised the team to work on the implementation roadmap with utmost accountability and as per timelines.

 

Smt Renuka Singh emphasised on the importance of this scheme for income enhancement and employment generation for the tribal communities. This scheme would be instrumental in bringing about impact at the community level for tribal groups, she explained.

 

MD TRIFED, Shri Pravir Krishna thanked the dignitaries for guiding the team with valuable insights. He emphasized that Van Dhan Programme would be the priority and there would be selection of the best functioning collectives from LAMPs, Aajivika Missions, and JFMCs, for implementation of the scheme at ground level. He emphasized on the importance of a sustainable business plan & marketing strategy for successful business operations of Van Dhan Self Help Groups. 

 

As included in the 100 days’ program of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, the Van Dhan Karyakaram would establish 50,000 ‘Van Dhan Vikas Kendras’ in the tribal areas of the country to ensure livelihood generation, income enhancement and empowerment of tribals. The Scheme will have a coverage of 27 states and 307 predominant tribal districts across India. The Van Dhan Karyakaram will cover 50 non-nationalized MFP items with Minimum Support Price to provide fair and remunerative returns to the tribals. The scheme aims to set up and operationalize 3000 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras in FY 2019-20, of which 600 VDVKs will be established during the 100-Day Plan.

                The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (in short FRA, 2006) was notified for operation on 31.12.2007 to undo the historical injustice done to forest dwellers (both tribal and other forest dwelling communities) whose rights over the forest land were not recognized during colonial period well as independent India. This is an Act to recognize and vest the forest rights and occupation in forest land in forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers who have been residing in such forests for generations but whose right could not be recorded; to provide for a framework for recording the forest right so vested and the nature of evidence required for such recognition and vesting in respect of forest land. 

 

As per the provisions of Act and Rules framed there under, the State Government,/UTs are responsible for its implementation. As per  information received from State Governments/UTs up to 31.03.2019, under the FRA, 42,37,853 claims (40,89,035 individual and 1,48,818 community claims) have been filed and 19,64,048 titles (18,87,894 individual and 76,154 community claims) have been distributed to the extent of 1,29,38,762.14 acres of forest land.

 

As per information received from Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, there is no economic policy of forests per se. However National Forest Policy (NFP) 1988 provides a broad framework related to economic aspects of forests. Meeting basic requirements of fuelwood, fodder, minor forest produce and small timber of the rural and tribal population is one of the basic objectives of the policy. This is incorporated in essential of forest management. 

For achieving this, NFP envisages a massive needs-based and time bound programme of afforestation and tree planting, with particular emphasis on fuelwood and fodder development, on all degraded and denuded lands in the country, whether forest or non-forest land. Village and community lands, including those on foreshores and environs of tanks, not required for other productive uses, should be taken up for the development of tree crops and fodder resources: Village and community lands, including those on foreshores and environs of tanks, not required for other productive uses, should be taken up for the development of tree crops and fodder resources. Technical assistance and other inputs necessary for initiating such programmes should be provided by the Government. The revenues generated through such programmes should belong to the panchayats where the lands are vested in them; in all other cases, such revenues should be shared with the local communities in order to provide an incentive to them. 

The rights and concessions enjoyed by them should be fully protected. Their domestic requirements of fuelwood, fodder, minor forest produce and construction timber should be first made available through conveniently located depots at reasonable prices. NFP provides broad governing principles for forest based industries also. 

The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change constituted an expert committee for restructuring the Course Curriculum for training of Indian Forest Service (IFS) officers in Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA), Dehradun vide OM dated 19.02.2019. The committee in its recommendations submitted to the Ministry, has suggested to give more emphasis on the welfare of Tribal Communities by incorporating a module titled “Tribals and Forest Dependent Communities” in the IFS probationers professional training curriculum.

During the year 2017-18, no fund was released, however, the fund released in the previous year was revalidated for utilisation during the year 2017-18. Further, during 2018-19, Rs.308.32 lakh was released to the districts of Bihar by the Government of India. These funds have been released to the districts of Bihar for running of the OSCs by setting them up in pre-existing buildings as well as for construction of new buildings for OSCs as per the provisions of the OSC Scheme. Since the OSC Scheme is an ongoing scheme, all unutilised funds are available with the State Government/ District Authorities for its implementation.  Directions have been issued from time to time for speedy implementation of the OSC scheme and proper utilisation of its funds.  Presently 38 OSCs are operational in all the districts of Bihar is given below:

All 35 districts (as per census 2011) of State of Maharashtra are covered under implementation of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme (BBBP).  Out of these, 31 districts are covered under multi - sectorial intervention, Media & Advocacy component and remaining 4 districts are covered under alert Media & Advocacy outreach component of the Scheme.

 

The overall target and objective of the Scheme is to improve declining Child Sex Ratio in the country and create an enabling environment for the education of girl child and this requires long-term attitudinal change. The key indicator to achieve this target is to improve the Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) by 2 points in a year.  The latest reports of Health Management Information System (HMIS) of Ministry of Health & Family welfare (MoHFW) reveal that SRB is showing improving trends and has increased from 923 to 931 at National level for the time period between F.Y. 2015-16 & 2018-19. 

 

At the State/UT level, SRB in 21 States/UTs is showing improving trends whereas 3 States/UT are stable in comparison of previous F.Y. 2017-18.  The State of Maharashtra has improved the SRB by 6 points from 924 (2015-16) to 930 (2018-19).

The beneficiaries under the Anganwadi Services Scheme are identified on the basis of Aadhaar which is used as identity document for delivery of services or benefits which brings in transparency and efficiency and enables beneficiaries to get their entitlements. 

 

The beneficiaries not possessing Aadhar card are assisted by the field functionaries to obtain the Aadhar card. Till such time they get the Adhaar card, they are provided the Anganwadi Services on the basis of alternative identification document. This is an important tool to eliminate fake beneficiaries, if any, and it is an ongoing exercise. It is applicable to all the States/UTs including Kerala.

Further, malnutrition is a complex and multi-dimensional issue, affected mainly by a number of generic factors including poverty, inadequate food consumption due to access and availability issues, inequitable food distribution, improper maternal infant and child feeding and care practices, inequity and gender imbalances, poor sanitary and environmental conditions; and restricted access to quality health, education and social care services.

As per National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4 in 2015-16), the State-wise number of districts with the prevalence of Stunting among children under 5 years and underweight in women (15-49 years) higher than the national average are as follows:

The status of malnutrition in the country is reflected in the data captured by the National Family Health Surveys conducted periodically by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Consultations and discussions with WHO, UNICEF and other stakeholders to reduce the level of malnutrition amongst children and women is a continuous process.

 

The Government has accorded high priority to the issue of malnutrition and is implementing several schemes/programmes of different Ministries/Departments through States/UTs to address various aspects related to nutrition. This Ministry is implementing POSHAN Abhiyaan, Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana, Anganwadi Services and Scheme for Adolescent Girls under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) as direct targeted interventions to address the problem of malnutrition in the country. The details of funds allocated/released and utilized during the last three years and the current year under these schemes is at Annexure I, II, III and IV.

All these schemes address one or other aspects related to nutrition and have the potential to improve nutritional outcomes in the country. As a result of the concerted efforts, the level of malnutrition has reduced in the country as is evident from the report of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) – 4 conducted in 2015-16. Further, Government has set up POSHAN Abhiyaan in December, 2017, with an aim to reduce malnutrition in the country in a phased manner, through the lifecycle, by adopting a synergized and result oriented approach. The major works undertaken under this Abhiyaan are ensuring convergence with various other programme, Information Technology enabled Common Application Software for strengthening service delivery and interventions, Community Mobilization and Awareness advocacy leading to Jan Andolan - to educate the people on nutritional aspects, Capacity Building of Frontline Functionaries and incentivizing States/ UTs for achieving goals.

                As per the report of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) – 4 conducted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2015-16, 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted.

 

As per the information from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, although malnourished children are more vulnerable than normal children to any infection including bone infection due to lower immunity, there is no data to substantiate increase in bone infection among malnourished children due to which children are becoming victims of disability.

 

The Government has accorded high priority to the issue of malnutrition and is implementing several schemes/programmes of different Ministries/Departments through States/UTs to address various aspects related to nutrition. This Ministry is implementing POSHAN Abhiyaan, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, Anganwadi Services and Scheme for Adolescent Girls under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme as direct targeted interventions to address the problem of malnutrition in the country. The details of amount spent during the last three years under these schemes are given below:

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed web  portals “TrackChild” and “Khoya-Paya” to track the missing and found children. The TrackChild Portal is implemented in association with various stakeholders including Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Ministry of Railways, State Governments/UT Administrations, Child Welfare Committees, Juvenile Justice Boards and National Legal Services Authority. The “Khoya-Paya” has been integrated as a citizen corner on TrackChild portal. 

 

In addition, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has been prepared for tracing the missing children, and has been circulated to all States and UTs for further dissemination to all other stake holders such as Police and Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) Juvenile Justice Baoards (JJBs). This SOP lays down the uniform guidelines for expediting the search and rehabilitation of a missing child all over the country. The drive to rescue missing children at major Railway Stations is available through a dedicated toll free number, 1098 which is a 24X7 Child Helpline called Childline. It can be accessed by children in crisis or by adults on their behalf from any place in the geographical location of India. 

 

Further Ministry is also collobarating with Ministry of Railways to rescue and rehabilitate children in difficult circumstances who come in contact with Railways by setting up child help desks at Railway platforms. These Child help Desks are being manned by Childline partners at the Railway Stations. 

 

Currently, Child Help Desk (CHD) has been set up at 97 major Railway Stations. The details regarding children in contact with Railways in major railway stations who have been provided services during the last three years is given below:

                State Governments and UT Administrations are responsible for implementation of The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005. The Central Government issues advisories and provides financial assistance and other support of spreading awareness about this law.  

 

As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data which is available up to 2016, a total number of 426 cases in 2014, 461 cases in 2015 and 437 cases in 2016 were registered under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.  The number of cases filed under the Act shows that women are taking recourse to this law to get reliefs from domestic violence. Further there was a drop in the number of registered cases from 2015 to 2016 as per NCRB data. 

 

Awareness generation among men and women in the society is undertaken through media campaign.  Further, a letter from the Ministry of Women & Child Development was issued on 12th July, 2018 requesting the Chief Ministers of State Governments to appoint sufficient number of Protection Officers having independent charge of the PWDVA, who should be approachable and should also cover the spread of population, and to allocate separate budget for smooth functioning of Protection Officers, providing support to survivors, training and capacity building of police, judiciary, medical officers, service providers and for creating mass awareness around the Act.  

 

In addition, it has also requested that the information regarding Protection Officers and service providers should be published and made available in public domain at panchayat offices, police stations and through wall writings. 

 

For prevention and early intervention, States and UTs have been requested to undertake mass awareness generation programs and gender sensitization trainings at all levels. They have also been requested that the Form IV under Rule 8(1)(ii) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules, 2006, which provides information on rights of aggrieved persons under the PWDVA, should be made available in local languages so that aggrieved women are able to understand their rights in a simplified manner. 

 

For effectively creating mass awareness about this law, innovative approaches such as spreading of social/ informative messages through LPG gas bills in regional languages, television and radio spots, use of creatives for IRCTC and displays at airport, in metro and on access cards have been undertaken as part of the media campaign by this Ministry.

                The Nutrient requirements and recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for all age groups of the population including children are set and revised periodically by the National Institute of Nutrition - Indian Council of Medical Research.

 

The requirement of nutrients in children varies with the age, gender and nutritional status of the children. The RDAs for Indian population are finalized by National Institute of Nutrition – Indian Council of Medical Research (NIN-ICMR) based on the recommendations of the Expert Group, based on individual variability and nutrient bioavailability from the habitual diet.

 

As per the information received from Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Department of Food & Public Distribution has approved the ""Centrally Sponsored Pilot Scheme on Fortification of Rice & its distribution through Public Distribution System"". Financial Assistance up to 90% in case of North-Eastern, Hilly and Island States and up to 75% in case of rest of the States has been extended. Further, Government of India has also advised all States/UTs especially those States/UTs that are distributing wheat flour through Public Distribution System (PDS), to distribute fortified wheat flour through PDS. The details of the States/UTs disbursing fortified ration through PDS is given below:

                 As per the report of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) – 4 conducted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2015-16, 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight, 38.4% are stunted and 58.5% are anemic. Further, 22.9% women (15-49 years of age) have chronic energy deficiency (BMI less than 18.5) and 53% are anemic.

 

The Government has accorded high priority to the issue of malnutrition and is implementing several schemes/programmes of different Ministries/Departments through States/UTs to address various aspects related to nutrition. This Ministry is implementing POSHAN Abhiyaan, Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana, Anganwadi Services and Scheme for Adolescent Girlsunder the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme as direct targeted interventions to address the problem of malnutrition in the country. 

 

UN agencies provide technical support to the Government to prevent and reduce malnutrition among women and children. No financial assistance has been received from United Nations or UNESCO.  

 

The monitoring systems in-built in the schemes are as under:

 


	
	NITI Aayog undertakes periodic monitoring and evaluation of POSHAN Abhiyaan through their ‘Technical Unit’ for assessing the impact of the programme. In order to ensure regular monitoring and review of all sectoral programmes under POSHAN Abhiyaan, a National Nutrition Resource Centre – Central Project Monitoring Unit (NNRC–CPMU) has been constituted.
	


 


	
	The Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana is implemented through web based Management and Information (MIS) Software, viz., Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana-Common Application Software (PMMVY-CAS) which is used as an effective tool for regular monitoring. 
	


 


	
	The Anganwadi Services Scheme has an in-built monitoring system since its inception to track the physical progress of the scheme in respect of various input process, output and impact indicators through a standardized Management Information System (MIS).Further, in order to strengthen the performance of Anganwadi Services, Government has introduced monitoring and review mechanism at different levels (National/ State/ District/ Block and Anganwadi level). 
	


 

Under the Scheme for Adolescent Girls, monitoring committees have been set up at all levels (National, State, District, Block and Village level) to take stock of the progress of the scheme as also to strengthen the coordination and convergence between concerned departments. 

 

The details of amount released during the last three years and current year under these schemes is at Annexure I, II, III and IV.

                The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme aims to address the critical issue of declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR). The specific objectives of the scheme are:


	prevent gender biased sex selective elimination 
	ensure survival and protection of the girl child
	ensure education and participation of the girl child through coordinated and convergent efforts. 


 

Out of 640 districts (as per Census 2011), 405 districts are selected under Multi-sectoral intervention and advocacy & media campaign, while remaining 235 districts are covered under advocacy & media campaign only.  

 

BBBP scheme has provision for awards and recognitions but no provision for direct individual cash transfer for any strata of society including daughters of poor women. It is not a DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) scheme. Under the scheme, combined data of urban and rural areas are considered for the Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB). 

 

The latest reports of Health Management Information System (HMIS) of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) for the time period between F.Y. 2015-16 and F.Y. 2018-19, reveal that SRB is showing improving trends from 923 to 931, which include urban areas as well as rural areas of the country.

 

This information was given by the Minister of Women and Child Development, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.

                India, as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), has committed itself to ensure that all children enjoy their right to survival, development, protection and participation. In pursuance of this, the Ministry of Women and Child Development has adopted the National Policy for Children (NPC), 2013 on 26th April, 2013 which affirms the Government's commitment to realization of the rights of all children in the country. It recognizes every person below the age of eighteen years as a child and that childhood is an integral part of life with a value of its own, and a long term, sustainable, multi-spectral, integrated and inclusive approach is necessary for the harmonious development and protection of children. 

 

The Policy has identified survival, health, nutrition, education, development, protection and participation as the undeniable rights of every child, and has also declared these as key priority areas. Further, the Ministry has also launched the National Plan of Action for Children, 2016 on 24.01.2017 in pursuance of the NPC, 2013.

 

The Government has enacted the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), to provide care and protection to vulnerable children, which mandates that no waiver of any of the right of the child is permissible or valid (Section 3(ix) of the JJ Act, 2015). 

 

This information was given by the Minister of Women and Child Development, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.

                Food fortification is a complementary strategy to address micronutrient deficiencies in addition to dietary diversification and micronutrient supplementation. Therefore, in order to reduce the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, emphasis is given on all the three strategies through the schemes/programmes implemented by the various departments/ministries. These include iron and folic acid supplementation, calcium supplementation, Vitamin-A supplementation and mandatory use of iodized salt. 

 

Also, nutrition education to promote the use of healthy balanced diets through dietary diversification is an important component of different Government programmes such as POSHAN Abhiyaan and Anganwadi Services. Ministry has advised all the States/UTs to ensure use of relevant fortified food articles (wherever supplied) in the administration of the Supplementary Nutrition Programme.

 

The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme is a Centrally sponsored Scheme implemented by States/UTs. The Scheme provides for a package of six services including Supplementary Nutrition (SNP) for children in the age group of 0-6 years and pregnant and lactating mothers.

 

The Supreme Court vide their order dated 07.10.2004, in a Public Interest Litigation – W.P. No.196 of 2001, had directed that the contractors shall not be used for supply of nutrition in Anganwadis and preferably ICDS funds shall be spent by making use of village communities, self-help groups and Mahila Mandals for buying of grains and preparation of meals. These directions were reiterated by the Supreme Court on 13.12.2006 and 22.04.2009. Accordingly, all the States/UTs were addressed on 17.12.2004 for compliance of Supreme Court order dated 07.10.2004. Later on, in Civil Appeal No.7104 of 2011 –Shagun Mahila Udyogik Sahakari Sanstha Maradit versus State of Maharashtra & others the Supreme Court gave judgment dated 19th August, 2011. All the States/UTs were requested on 9thMay, 2012 to comply with the directions of the Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgment.

 

In order to eradicate the corruption and strengthen the performance of Anganwadi Services Scheme, Government has introduced 5-tier monitoring and review mechanism at different levels (National, State, District, Block and Anganwadi level) for monitoring the status of implementation of the scheme. Government has issued guidelines on 31.03.2011 for constitution of Monitoring and Review Committees at different levels to review progress in implementation of the Scheme.

 

The complaints received in respect of irregularities/corruption in implementation of ICDS Scheme (now renamed as Anganwadi Services) are forwarded to concerned States/UTs for taking appropriate action. Reports on complaints which are serious in nature are sought from State Governments/UT Administrations. The States/UTs are responsible for their administrative control. Action for any misconduct or for involvement of any employee in any corrupt practices is taken by the respective State Governments/UT Administrations as per their service rules.

 

During the last 5 years, 39 complaints have been received regarding improper implementation of the Scheme.  The complaints received pertain to State Governments/UT Administrations are as under:

                There is an increase of Rs. 26.00 crore in the budgetary allocation for incentives to sportspersons. In the Interim budget this year, the allocation is Rs. 87.00 crore as compared to Rs. 61.00 crore in the previous year.  

All eligible sportspersons are being provided cash awards, meritorious pension as per existing policy and guidelines.  In view of inadequate provisions last year money for distributing cash awards to medal winners was borrowed from the National Sports Development Fund and the same would be reimbursed out of allocation of the current year.

 While augmentation of sports infrastructure / sports facilities for high performance at international arena is a continuing process , the extant infrastructure, facilities and incentives being provided by the Central Government have been motivating sportspersons to excel in international sports competitions.

                Shri Kiren Rijiju, Minister of state (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports met the Indian women’s hockey team here today and congratulated them for their victory at the FIH Series Finals that were held in Hiroshima, Japan from
June 15-23. With this win, India has moved one step closer towards qualifying for next year’s Tokyo Olympics, as they will now participate in the 14-team FIH Olympic Qualifiers to be held later this year. The qualifiers will be a bilateral two-match series, from where the winners of each of the seven matches will qualify for the Olympics.



India remained unbeaten throughout their campaign, scoring 29 goals and conceding just four. The women’s team recorded convincing victories over Chile, beating them 4-2 in the semi-final, and hosts and Asian Games champions Japan 3-1 in the final. Penalty corner specialist Gurjit Kaur was India’s leading goal scorer in the tournament with 11 goals. Captain Rani Rampal added one more accolade to her growing profile, as she was adjudged the Player of the Tournament. There was also a special performance from 19-year-old Lalremsiami who played the semi-final and final, despite receiving news that her father had expired the day before the
semi-final encounter.



The Indian women’s hockey team has played the Summer Olympics on two previous occasions, in 1980, where they finished fourth, and in 2016. With their improving fortunes on the global stage, having reached the semi-finals of the 2018 Commonwealth Games and earning a silver at the Asian Games, India will look to seal a berth in Tokyo later this year.

Speaking about the achievement of the team, Shri Rijiju said, “The Indian women’s hockey team has played very well, and made us proud. I congratulate the team for its excellent performance. The ministry will extend all support to the players, both individually and as a team. I will visit their training center in Bengaluru to meet their coaches and discuss the requirements of the team. India has a good chance of qualifying for the Olympics and winning a medal in hockey.”

                 Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports, Shri Kiren Rijiju today felicitated the Indian archery contingent for their superlative performance at the World Archery Championships held in Hertogenbosh, Netherlands last week. Meeting the archers at the Sports Authority of India headquarters here today the Minister congratulated them for winning an Olympic quota for Tokyo 2020 and bagging three medals in the Championship.

India won one silver and two bronze medals at the event, making it the best-ever medal haul in an Archery World Championship. India had won two silver medals in the same event in 2015, which is the country’s second best performance at the Championship. The Indian men’s recurve team comprising Atanu Das, Tarundeep Rai and Pravin Jadhav won a silver medal at the Championships.



Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said that government is going to extend all assistance to these players, and also to those who have performed well in other sports and have the potential to win an Olympic medal. He further said that government will provide all the support the athletes ask for – be it in coaching or technical facilities. Shri Rijiju said, “I am very happy that the men’s team has already won an Olympic quota, and even the women archers are very confident. India has traditionally been very strong in archery and if we can win an Olympic gold in the sport then we will be able to prove that.”

Archer Atanu Das made his international debut in 2008 and his current world ranking is 22.Tarun Deep Rai, who started his career as an archer in 2003, at the age of 19, was also a part of the last Indian men’s recurve team that won a silver medal in the World Archery Championship in 2005.

Pravin Jadhav started his career in athletics and took up professional archery a year into his training in athletics, and has excelled in it. The son of a daily wage labourer, he says though the equipment for archery is expensive, he was able to pursue the sport because of the support he received through Government schemes.

With this year’s silver, the men’s team earned a quota for next year’s Tokyo Olympics, which also assured the Indian men three full athlete quotas for the individual recurve event at the Olympics.

In the women’s category, Jyothi Surekha Vennam won India’s first individual medal in women’s compound archery as she clinched a bronze medal following a shoot-off win over Turkey’s Yesim Bostan. Vennam is also a trained swimmer and entered Limca Book of Records at the age of 4 for crossing the Kaveri river three times.

This was also Vennam’s second world championship team medal, as she was a part of the Indian team that won silver at the 2017 World Championships. Vennam had won five mixed team medals at World Cup events in 2018 including the World Cup final. The Indian women’s compound team has had a stellar run since the beginning of 2018, when they won the silver medal at the Asian Games as well as the silver at the Berlin and Antalya World Cups. Vennam and Muskan Kirar were a part of all these victories. Kirar’s first international win was in 2017, but her big win before the World Championship was the gold medal in the women's compound final event at the Archery Asia Cup, stage-1 competition in Bangkok in March 2018.

Besides extending all training support, Sports Authority of India is also making arrangements for a mental trainer for the team to help them improve their focus and skills, in preparation for the Olympics.

                NITI Aayog released the Second Edition of “Healthy States, Progressive India” today. The report ranks states and Union territories innovatively on their year-on-year incremental change in health outcomes, as well as, their overall performance. The Round II report focuses on measuring and highlighting the overall performance and incremental improvement over a two year period (2016-17 and 2017-18) in the States and UTs

The report was released jointly by Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog, Dr. Rajiv Kumar , Member NITI Aayog Dr. VKPaul, CEO, NITI Aayog; Amitabh Kant and the Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare; Preeti Sudan The report has been developed by NITI Aayog, with technical assistance from the World Bank, and in consultation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).

 

The report is an annual systematic performance tool to measure the performance of the States and UTs. It ranks states and union territories on their year on year incremental change in health outcomes, as well as, their overall performance with respect to each other. The ranking is categorized as Larger States, Smaller States and Union Territories (UTs), to ensure comparison among similar entities. The Health Index is a weighted composite Index based on 23 indicators grouped into the domains of Health Outcomes, Governance and Information, and Key Inputs/Processes.  . Each domain has been assigned weights based on its importance and has been equally distributed among indicators.

Among the Larger States, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh & Maharashtra ranked on top in terms of overall performance, while Haryana, Rajasthan and Jharkhand are the top three ranking States in terms of annual incremental performance. Haryana, Rajasthan and Jharkhand showed the maximum gains in improvement of health outcomes from base to reference year in indicators such as Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR), Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR), Proportion Low Birth Weight among New-borns, Proportion of districts with functional Cardiac Care Units (CCUs), Proportion of ANCs registered within first trimester, Proportion of CHCs/PHCs with Quality Accreditation Certificates, full immunization coverage, institutional deliveries, Proportion of Specialist positions vacant at District Hospitals and Proportion of total staff (regular and contractual) with e-pay slip generated in the IT enabled Human Resources Management Information System.

 

The States are categorized on the basis of reference year Index score range: Front-runners: top one-third), Achievers: middle one-third, Aspirants: lowest one-third. The States are categorized into four groups based on incremental performance:  not improved (<=0 incremental change); least improved (0.01 to 2 points increase); moderately improved (2.01 to 4 points), and most improved (>4 points increase).

                NITI Aayog will release the second edition of “Healthy States, Progressive India” in the capital tomorrow on 25.6.2019. The Report will be released by VC NITI Aayog Dr. Rajiv Kumar in presence of Member NITI AayogDr. V K Paul, CEO NITI Aayog Amitabh Kant, Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan and representatives from World Bank.  

The Round-II report focuses on measuring and highlighting the overall performance and incremental improvement over a two-year period (2016-17 and 2017-18) in the States and UTs. It takes a comprehensive look at health in terms of Health Outcomes, Governance and Processes and impact of policy interventions. The report has been prepared in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and with technical assistance from the World Bank. 

First round of the Health Index:

In February 2018, the first round of the Health Index (referred to as 2017 Health Index) was released, which measured the annual and incremental performance of the States and UTs over the period of 2014-15 (base year) to 2015-16 (reference year). 

Among the Larger States, Kerala, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu ranked on top in terms of overall performance, while Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh were the top three ranking States in terms of annual incremental performance. Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh showed the maximum gains in improvement of health outcomes from base to reference year in indicators such as Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR), Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR), full immunization coverage, institutional deliveries, and People Living with HIV (PLHIV) on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART).

Among Smaller States, Mizoram ranked first followed by Manipur on overall performance, while Manipur followed by Goa were the top ranked States in terms of annual incremental performance. Manipur registered maximum incremental progress on indicators such as PLHIV on ART, first trimester antenatal care (ANC) registration, grading quality parameters of Community Health Centres (CHCs), average occupancy of key State-level officers and good reporting on the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP).

Among UTs, Lakshadweep showed both the best overall performance as well as the highest annual incremental performance. Lakshadweep showed the highest improvement in indicators such as institutional deliveries, tuberculosis (TB) treatment success rate, and transfer of National Health Mission (NHM) funds from State Treasury to implementation agency.

                The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister today released a detailed notetitled ‘GDP estimation in India- Perspectives and Facts’. The note can be accessed at http://eacpm.gov.in/reports-papers/eac-reports-papers/.

The note provides a clear rationale for India’s switch to an improved GDP estimation methodology in January 2015. The new methodology that uses 2011-12 as the base year includes two major improvements, a) Incorporation of MCA21 database, and b) Incorporation of the Recommendations of System of National Accounts (SNA), 2008. This change was in line with other countries that have changed their methodologies in line with SNA 2008 and revised their respective GDP figures. On an average, real GDP estimates saw an increase of 0.7% among OECD countries.  

As mentioned in EAC-PM’s press release dated 12 June 2019, the note also provides a point-to-point rebuttal to a recently published paper titled ‘India’s GDP Mis-estimation: Likelihood, Magnitudes, Mechanisms, and Implications’ by Dr.Arvind Subramanian. The primary contributors to the note, namely BibekDebroy, Rathin Roy, Surjit Bhalla, Charan Singh and Arvind Virmani reject Dr. Subramanian’smethodology, arguments and conclusions on the basis of academic merit and grasp of Indian realities. The note provides detailed evidence that indicates that Dr. Subramanian has cherry-picked a few indicators and performed a rather unconvincing regression analysis to prove his hypothesis that India’s GDP was over-estimated post 2011-12. For instance, the note highlights the absurdity in Dr. Subramanian’s paper that selectively ignores tax data based on the argument that the period post 2011-12 witnessed “major changes in direct and indirect taxes”. Interestingly, Mr. Subramanian’s analysis ends on 31st March 2017, while the only major tax change (GST) was introduced on 1st July 2017. In totality, the note highlights eight clear points with supportive facts and arguments that debunk Dr. Subramanian’s paper in entirety. 

The note concludes with the point that India’s GDP estimation methodology is by no means a perfect exercise and the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation is working on multiple aspects to improve the accuracy of economic data. However, the direction and pace of improvement is commendable and as of today India’s GDP estimation methodology is at par with its global standing as a responsible, transparent and well-managed economy. If anything, the weakness of Dr.Subramaniam’s attempt to suggest that the growth numbers are over-estimated confirms that the estimation process is robust to spurious criticism. Going forward, Indian National Income Accounting is bound to change for good and an important step in accomplishing that will involve criticism from experts and academics.But the country’s interests are not served by imparting sensationalism through negativity that questions the credibility of the system.

                The fifth meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog was held under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi at Rashtrapati Bhawan today. It was attended by the Governor of Jammu & Kashmir, 26 Chief Ministers and the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, apart from Union Ministers, who are ex-officio members and special invitees. Vice Chairman, Members, CEO and senior officers of NITI Aayog also attended the  meeting .

Setting the tone of the meeting, the Prime Minister emphasized that this is the meeting of Team India. The PM said that States should recognise their core competence, and work towards raising GDP targets right from the district level.

The Prime Minister highlighted the importance of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog as a platform to inspire cooperative federalism, stressing the need to collectively combat poverty, unemployment, drought, pollution, pockets of under-development and all such factors that constrain India’s progress. He emphasized that the goal is to realize the potential of this great country, to create a New India by 2022 and a USD five trillion economy by 2024.

The Prime Minister emphasized the need for every State to focus on increasing its share in the country’s GDP by evaluating the export potential of the State and determining the steps necessary for increasing exports and boosting employment.

Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog urged all States to offer their suggestions on the policy recommendations contained in NITI Aayog’s ‘Strategy for New India @ 75’ so that they can be tweaked to suit the ground realities in individual States.

 

Welcoming the constructive discussion and suggestions made by various Chief Ministers, the Prime Minister assured the Council that these suggestions would be seriously considered in the course of decision-making. On the Agenda before the Fifth Council Meeting were the following items:


	Rain-Water Harvesting
	Drought Situation and Relief Measures
	Aspirational Districts Programme – Achievements And Challenges 
	Transforming Agriculture: Need For Structural Reforms With Special Emphasis On:
	
		Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act
		Essential Commodities Act (ECA)  
	
	
	Security Related Issues with Specific Focus On LWE Districts


The Prime Minister appreciated the efforts of the States towards water conservation and urged all States to streamline and implement innovative water management measures. The creation of the Ministry of ‘Jal Shakti’ is a key step by the Union Government to develop an integrated and holistic perspective on water as a developmental resource.

There was broad consensus on reducing water wastage, promoting efficient water conservation practices across States, with rain-water harvesting to be undertaken at the household and community level with proactive policy and investment support. Various Chief Ministers presented best practices from their respective states which can serve as templates for replication across the country.

Many States such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana, Gujarat and Karnataka have adopted good practices in water conservation and rainwater harvesting. Some innovative steps include the Jalyukt Shivarin Maharashtra which made 11,000 villages drought free, Mukhya Mantri Jal Swavalamban Abhiyaan which resulted in five feet rise in groundwater in 21 districts, and Mission Kakatiya in Telangana which irrigates 19 Lakh Acres. Similarly, Sujalam Sufalam in Gujarat and artificial recharge scheme in Karnataka show that determined action produces good results. The spirit of the meeting was to build on the strength of every State so that each State can learn from the innovation and best practices of other States.

The Council also deliberated upon a closely related and deeply important issue of drought management and associate relief measures. The need to safeguard Indian agriculture and protect farmers from the vagaries of unpredictable monsoons was highlighted in the meeting, with various Chief Ministers suggesting possible short-term and long-term solutions for making India a ‘drought-free’ nation. These included reviewing their district agriculture contingency plans, streamlining provision of inputs such as seeds and making contingency plans for irrigation etc. It has been proposed that the Union Government consider developing a comprehensive drought management plan that can be applicable across States.

The Prime Minister also called upon the Fifth Governing Council Meeting to undertake foundational reforms in the agri-economy, leading to a complete transformation of the agriculture sector in India. The core agenda items included the need to review the implementation of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act and possible reform in the form of the Model APMC Act as well as exploring changes in the Essential Commodities Act, to ensure fair remuneration for the farmers, streamlining of supply, driving more investment into the sector and predictability of policy at national and regional levels. The Prime Minister emphasized the need for undertaking structural reforms in agriculture including encouraging corporate investment, strengthening logistics and focusing on food processing.

The Governing Council also reviewed the implementation of the Aspirational Districts Programme, which has emerged as a major policy innovation in driving inclusive growth. Rapid progress has been achieved across all Aspirational Districts that have participated in this programme in 49 key performance indicators of human and social development. Various Chief Ministers noted the success of the programme in their respective States, and discussed possible schemes for extension of the programme to rapidly develop blocks in remote and difficult areas so that the spirit of inclusive development is effectively enforced. The Prime Minister commended the district administration teams on implementing several ‘out-of-the-box’ ideas in the Aspirational Districts resulting in significant transformation in many districts.

The Prime Minister also reaffirmed the commitment of the Government to combat Left Wing Extremism (LWE), noting that many of the aspirational districts are affected by Naxal violence. He assured the Council that the Ministry of Home Affairs will coordinate with all affected States to decisively end LWE violence and drive the agenda of development in these regions.

The Union Home Minister highlighted the initiatives taken by the Central Government over the last five years for ensuring development and security in LWE affected areas, with achievement of significant success through the steadfast implementation of National Policy & Action Plan of 2015. Essential steps such as deployment of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) have helped carry out sustainable operations against Maoists.

He also informed the Council that there has also been an equally strong focus on developing road and telecom infrastructure in these areas. About 11,000 km of roads are being constructed at the cost of Rs 18,000 crore of which 5,500 km of road has already been completed. In order to improve telecom connectivity, 2335 mobile towers have also been installed and in next phase, 4072 towers costing Rs 11,000 Crore will be installed.

The Union Finance Minister appreciated the positive engagement and cooperation between the Centre and the States in the GST Council. She also highlighted the unprecedented devolution of a large share of funds from the Centre to the States over the last four years, noting that there has been massive increase in funds transfers under tax devolution, Finance Commission Grants and through other transfers such as under Centrally Sponsored Schemes. She stated that total transfers under various headings between 2011-12 and 2014-15 amounted to about Rs 20 lakh crore, but in the last four years this has increased to nearly Rs 41 lakh crore.

On the health sector, the Prime Minister said that several targets are to kept in mind, to be achieved by 2022. He also mentioned the target of eliminating TB by 2025. The Prime Minister urged those States who have not implemented PMJAY under Ayushman Bharat so far, to come onboard this scheme at the earliest. He said health and wellness should be the focal point of every decision.

Elaborating on the Union Government's guiding principle of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwaas, the Prime Minister said the schemes of the Union Government are no longer limited to certain people, or to certain regions, and are reaching everyone without discrimination, in a balanced way.

The Prime Minister announced the creation of a high-powered committee on structural reforms in agriculture. He further said that global circumstances currently offer a unique opportunity to India. He said India is establishing itself on global benchmarks such as Ease of Doing Business. To achieve the goal of becoming a five trillion dollar economy by 2024, the Prime Minister urged States to aim to increase their economy by 2 to 2.5 times, which would also increase the common man’s purchasing power. He called upon Chief Ministers to study their State's export potential and work on export promotion.

The Prime Minister said that the mining sector can provide significant employment opportunities. He said that bottlenecks in operationalization of mines continue to exist in several States. He said the NITI Aayog is working on these issues.

The Prime Minister thanked the Chief Ministers for their suggestions and reiterated that that the Union Government is keen to partner with the States, and work together for India's development.

                The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister set up a Beekeeping Development Committee under the Chairmanship of Professor Bibek Debroy. The Beekeeping Development Committee (BDC) has released its report today. BDC was constituted with the objective of identifying ways of advancing beekeeping in India, thatcan help in improving agricultural productivity, enhancing employment generation, augmenting nutritional security and sustaining biodiversity. Further, beekeeping can be an important contributor in achieving the 2022 target of doubling farmer incomes. 

As per Food and Agricultural Organization database, in 2017-18, India ranked eighth in the world in terms of honey production (64.9 thousand tonnes) while China stood first with a production level of 551 thousand tonnes. The report mentions that beekeeping cannot be restricted to honey and wax only, products such as pollen, propolis, royal jelly and bee venom are also marketable and can greatly help Indian farmers. Based on the area under cultivation in India and bee forage crops, India has a potential of about 200 million bee colonies as against 3.4 million bee colonies today. Increasing the number of bee colonies will not only increase the production of bee-related products but will boost overall agricultural and horticultural productivity. 

India’s recent efforts to improve the state of beekeeping have helped increase the volume of honey exports from 29.6 to 51.5 thousand tonnes between 2014-15 and 2017-18 (as per data from National Bee Board and Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare). However, challenges persist and a lot more can be done to enhance the scope and scale of beekeeping. Some of the recommendations in the report include, 


	Recognizing honeybees as inputs to agriculture and considering landless Beekeepers as farmers.
	Plantation of bee friendly flora at appropriate places and engaging women self-help groups in managing such plantations.
	Institutionalizing the National Bee Board and rechristening it as the Honey and Pollinators Board of India under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. Such a body would engage in advancing beekeeping through multiple mechanisms such as setting up of new Integrated Bee Development Centres, strengthening the existing ones, creating a honey price stabilization fund and collection of data on important aspects of apiculture.
	Recognition of apiculture as a subject for advanced research under the aegis of Indian Council for Agricultural Research. 
	Training and development of beekeepers by state governments. 
	Development of national and regional infrastructure for storage, processing and marketing of honey and other bee products. 
	Simplifying procedures and specifying clear standards for ease of exporting honey and other bee products. 


The BDC’s report has been submitted to the Prime Minister and has also been placed in the public domain.

                The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister today released a detailed notetitled ‘GDP estimation in India- Perspectives and Facts’. The note can be accessed at http://eacpm.gov.in/reports-papers/eac-reports-papers/.

The note provides a clear rationale for India’s switch to an improved GDP estimation methodology in January 2015. The new methodology that uses 2011-12 as the base year includes two major improvements, a) Incorporation of MCA21 database, and b) Incorporation of the Recommendations of System of National Accounts (SNA), 2008. This change was in line with other countries that have changed their methodologies in line with SNA 2008 and revised their respective GDP figures. On an average, real GDP estimates saw an increase of 0.7% among OECD countries. 

As mentioned in EAC-PM’s press release dated 12 June 2019, the note also provides a point-to-point rebuttal to a recently published paper titled ‘India’s GDP Mis-estimation: Likelihood, Magnitudes, Mechanisms, and Implications’ by Dr.Arvind Subramanian. The primary contributors to the note, namely BibekDebroy, Rathin Roy, Surjit Bhalla, Charan Singh and Arvind Virmani reject Dr. Subramanian’smethodology, arguments and conclusions on the basis of academic merit and grasp of Indian realities. The note provides detailed evidence that indicates that Dr. Subramanian has cherry-picked a few indicators and performed a rather unconvincing regression analysis to prove his hypothesis that India’s GDP was over-estimated post 2011-12. For instance, the note highlights the absurdity in Dr. Subramanian’s paper that selectively ignores tax data based on the argument that the period post 2011-12 witnessed “major changes in direct and indirect taxes”. Interestingly, Mr. Subramanian’s analysis ends on 31st March 2017, while the only major tax change (GST) was introduced on 1st July 2017. In totality, the note highlights eight clear points with supportive facts and arguments that debunk Dr. Subramanian’s paper in entirety.

The note concludes with the point that India’s GDP estimation methodology is by no means a perfect exercise and the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation is working on multiple aspects to improve the accuracy of economic data. However, the direction and pace of improvement is commendable and as of today India’s GDP estimation methodology is at par with its global standing as a responsible, transparent and well-managed economy. If anything, the weakness of Dr.Subramaniam’s attempt to suggest that the growth numbers are over-estimated confirms that the estimation process is robust to spurious criticism. Going forward, Indian National Income Accounting is bound to change for good and an important step in accomplishing that will involve criticism from experts and academics.But the country’s interests are not served by imparting sensationalism through negativity that questions the credibility of the system.

                The former Chief Economic Adviser (CEA), Dr. Arvind Subramanian, has published a paper “India’s GDP Mis-estimation: Likelihood, Magnitudes, Mechanisms, and Implications” in June, 2019, on the basis of which he has also published an article in Indian media, making strong claims about India’s real GDP figures between 2011-12 and 2016-17. It is worth noting that the Base Year of India’s income calculations shifted to 2011-12 on the basis of recommendations of several committees with experts in National Income Accounting. It was on the basis of these recommendations, started in 2008, that the Government implemented the change from January, 2015. Therefore, it is wrong to suggest that the views of experts have not been taken into account while changing the Base Year or weights or switching from Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) to Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) 21. In his paper, Dr. Subramanian has used cross-country regressions to estimate what India’s GDP should be. Using cross-country regressions to estimate GDP is a most unusual exercise, as is the suggestion that any country’s GDP that is off the regression line must be questioned. The proxy indicators that he used can also be questioned. Nor does this exercise allow for GDP increases on the basis of productivity gains. A country’s GDP is in nominal terms and any exercise should be on the basis of nominal figures, not real growth rates. The Economic Advisory Council will examine in detail the estimates made in Dr. Arvind Subramanian’s paper and come out with a point-to-point rebuttal in due course. At the moment, it is felt that any attempt to sensationalize what should be a proper academic debate is not desirable from the point of view of preserving the independence and quality of India’s statistical systems, all of which the former CEA is familiar with. These are certainly issues that Dr. Subramanian must certainly have raised while he was working as CEA, though by his own admission, he has taken time to understand India’s growth numbers and is still unsure.

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is conducting a Market Study on E-commerce in India (‘Study’). In view of the rapid growth of electronic commerce (‘e-commerce’) and the rising importance of online trade in a large number of goods and services in India, the study will allow the CCI to develop a better understanding of the functioning of e-commerce in the country and its implications for markets and competition.

The preliminary findings of the study will be presented at a Workshop to be held in the end of August 2019. All relevant stakeholders will be invited to share their views and deliberate on identified issues at this workshop. The final study report is expected to be published in the third quarter of 2019-20.

The e-commerce study is 20th in the series of market studies that have been conducted by the CCI till date. Market studies contribute significantly to the capacity of competition authorities in appreciating competitive dynamics in markets and can also form a useful basis for competition advocacy. The e-commerce study does not form part of any investigation and/or inquiry in any of the proceedings pending before the CCI. The study of e-commerce is necessary given the novel issues and challenges that digital markets bring forth for competition regulation.

The objectives of the study on e-commerce in India are:


	to study market trends with a particular focus on emerging distribution methods and strategies in response to ecommerce
	to understand business practices and contractual provisions in ecommerce, their underlying rationale and implications for competition.
	to identify impediments to competition, if any, relating to ecommerce.
	to ascertain enforcement and advocacy priorities for the CCI in e-commerce


 

The study is a combination of desk research, market survey and stakeholder consultation. Qualitative and quantitative information is being collected from secondary and primary sources. Designed by a market study team at the CCI, it is being implemented by an external agency that has been engaged for the purpose. The study team is holding consultation meetings with enterprises and industry associations followed by a questionnaire survey amongst a range of stakeholders throughout the country.

The enterprises concerned include e-commerce platforms, manufacturers, wholesalers/ retailers, hotels, restaurants and payment systems. The study intends to cover such products where the growth of online commerce has been the most significant, including both goods (such as electronics, mobiles, lifestyle etc.) and services (travel & hospitality, food delivery). The focus areas of the study include the emerging trends in business models and distribution mechanisms, market structure and business practices including contractual provisions and vertical restraints.

                The Competition Commission of India (Commission) has published the order approving the acquisition of electrical and automation (EA) business of Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) by Schneider Electric India Private Limited (Schneider) and MacRitchie Investments Pte. Ltd. (MacRitchie). 

The approval is subject to modifications that are aimed at eliminating the likely anti-competitive effects of the proposed acquisition. The above order was a result of an in-depth inquiry undertaken pursuant to the notice given by Schneider and MacRitchie under sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) on 16th July, 2018. The Commission found that Schneider and L&T are the first and second leading players in terms of sales and distribution reach in the low voltage (LV) switchgear industry in India. Their consolidation would inter alia lock a large part of the LV switchgear distributors and other downstream players with the combined entity, thereby making it difficult for new players to enter the market. Thus, the Commission was of the view that the acquisition of EA business of L&T would reduce competition and confer the combined entity, the ability to increase price.

In order to eliminate the competition concerns, the Commission has ordered the Acquirers to reserve a part of L&T’s installed capacity to offer white labelling services to third party competitors. This facility would be available in respect of five high market share LV switchgears, which are generally used together in LV panels. Under the white labelling services, the third party competitors can take L&T products on a reasonable price for selling under their own brand, for a period of five years. Subsequently, these competitors can get access to the technology of white-labelled products to manufacture them, for the next five years. To open up their distribution network to competitors, Schneider would revise its commercial policies and remove de facto exclusivity in distribution agreements. Further, Schneider would not discontinue L&T products and not increase their average selling price, for a period of five years.

The remedies ordered by the Commission are expected to allow business expansion of competitors in the five white-labelled products thereby leverage their brand position in the overall LV switchgear business. The competitors could avail this opportunity to strengthen their portfolio of products, increase the viability of their own brand in a sustainable manner and become credible competitors.

                The Competition Commission of India (‘Commission’) has found Madhya Pradesh Chemists and Druggist Association (‘MPCDA’), Indore Chemists Association (‘ICA’), Himalaya Drug Company (‘HDC’) and Intas Pharmaceuticals Limited (‘IPL’) along with some of their office bearers/officials to be in contravention of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 (‘Act’).

The Commission imposed a monetary penalty on the associations i.e. Rs. 4,18,404/- on MPCDA and Rs. 39,142/- on ICA, in addition to cease and desist directions, issued under Section 27 of the Act. Further taking into account the role played by certain office bearers of the said associations, penalties were imposed on such office bearers. The Commission after taking into account the mitigating factors demonstrated by Himalaya Drug Company and Intas Pharmaceutical Limited, imposed on said companies amounting to Rs. 18,59,58,000/- and Rs. 55,59,68,000/- respectively. Penalty was also imposed on certain officials of these companies.  The Commission, however, did not find any evidence of contravention on the part of certain other associations and pharmaceutical companies.

In addition to this, the Commission also directed MPCDA to organise at least five competition awareness and compliance programmes over a period of six months in the State of Madhya Pradesh for its members and directed ICA to organise one competition awareness programme in the district of Indore. The Commission further directed HDC and IPL to bring into place a Competition Compliance Programme and file compliance report with the Commission.

Action was initiated after information was filed with the Commission by M/s Madhya Pradesh Chemists and Distributors Federation alleging contravention of the provisions of Section 3 of the Act by MPCDA and others including certain pharmaceutical companies. The allegations were that the above named associations, through their practices of mandating ‘No Objection Certificate’ (‘NOC’)/ Letter of Consent (LOC’) prior to appointment of stockists were stifling competition in the market by limiting access of consumers to various pharmaceutical products and controlling supply of drugs in the market. The Commission after forming a prima-facie opinion directed the office of Director General (‘DG’) to conduct investigation into the matter.

An investigation carried out by the DG established contravention on the part of said associations and certain pharmaceutical companies, who were found to be facilitating such anti-competitive practices. DG also identified certain individuals’/ officer bearers/ officials of the associations and pharmaceutical companies to be liable under Section 48 of the Act.

The Commission after appreciation of the detailed submission of the concerned parties and based on the evidence on record, found the conduct of the aforementioned associations and pharmaceutical companies to be in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(3)(a) and 3(3)(b) read with Section 3(1) of the Act. 

The Commission made the order on 03.06.2019. The detailed order is available at the Commission’s website www.cci.gov.in
