“On the joyous occasion of Janmashtami, I convey my warm greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens in India and abroad.

Yogeshwar Krishna embodied righteousness against evil and devotion to truthfulness. He taught us to focus on ‘Nishkam Karma’ i.e. responsibility rather than reward. Janmashtami is a day to commit ourselves to the life and teachings of Shree Krishna.

Let us resolve to imbibe these timeless and universal values and follow them for the betterment of our lives and the world”.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the first World Youth Conference on Kindness in New Delhi today (August 23, 2019).

Addressing the gathering, the President said that Mahatma Gandhi was not just a great leader and visionary, he was one who personified certain timeless ideals and values. We could place Gandhiji in a time machine and transport him to any period of human existence and we would find him to be relevant. This is also true of the times we live in. Gandhiji remains extremely relevant to our present day concerns such as need for peace and tolerance, terrorism and climate change.

The President said that the strife and violence that we see in the world today is often based in deep-rooted prejudices. These make us see the world through the binary of “us versus them”. Following Gandhiji’s footsteps, we must let ourselves and our children interact and engage with those whom we tend to define as ‘them’. Greater interaction is the best way to develop a sensitive understanding, which can help us overcome our prejudices.

The President said that education too can play an important role in overcoming our prejudices. We need to evaluate and evolve the premise, goals and structure of our education system. Education needs to go beyond mere literacy. Education must facilitate and challenge the young to search deep within themselves and build their inner strength to sympathize or relate to the suffering of others. We need to educate young people such that they can defy and transcend boundaries of class and race. We need them to be educated and creative to find solutions to entrenched structural injustices and inequities. We need an education that can touch our emotions and our spirits.

The President noted that this Conference has brought together youth leaders from around the world. He said that these youth leaders and millions of young men and women like them have the biggest stake in making our world kind, compassionate and peaceful. He expressed confidence that what the youth leaders learn and experience in this Conference will inspire each one of them to be the ambassadors of kindness for rest of their lives. 

The first World Youth Conference on Kindness is being organised by the UNESCO Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development, Ministry of Human Resource Development with the aim to impart critical competencies (i.e. empathy, compassion, mindfulness and critical inquiry) in global youth to inspire, empower and enable them to transform themselves and build long-lasting peace in their communities. Youth leaders, representing over 27 countries, are participating in this Conference.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received  Mr Edgar Chagwa Lungu, the President of the Republic of Zambia, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (August 21, 2019). The President also hosted a banquet in his honour.

Welcoming the Zambian President on his first state visit to India, the President said that development cooperation is a key pillar of India-Zambia partnership. India is committed to cooperate with Zambia within the framework of South-South Cooperation. We are happy to extend capacity building, skill development and financing assistance to support Zambia’s growth and development.

The President said that the bilateral trade and investment partnership between India and Zambia is impressive. But the two countries can do a lot more together. Indian investments in Zambia have contributed to Zambian growth and development. Indian companies are keen to further invest in Zambia. They are looking at new investment opportunities in the mining, health, infrastructure and energy sectors.

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that our people and our youth have similar aspirations. They wish to lead the world on innovation, smart solutions, next-generation technologies, green growth and more. We must exchange knowledge and skills to fulfil their aspirations. Smart Zambia and Digital India could not be better partners for each other. He expressed hope that India’s tele-education and tele-medicine expertise would create new opportunities for the youth in Zambia.

	It is an honour Mr. President to host you on your first State Visit to India. Last year, I had a memorable visit to your beautiful country. Your exceptional warmth and hospitality made it even more special. We wish to lace your stay in India with as much warmth and affection. 


Mr. President,


	Zambia-India ties are deep and historical. We have walked together, hand-in-hand, in our onward march as democratic nations. Our leaders have inspired each other in our struggle for freedom. Mahatma Gandhi won independence for us, but he was equally concerned about the freedom of the Zambian people. We feel truly privileged that his teachings continue to resonate among your people and your leaders. Your first President Dr. Kenneth Kaunda, a living legend, is a true Gandhian. I had the privilege to call on him during my State Visit to Zambia. As we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary this year, we pay our deepest gratitude to the Zambian people for the love and respect they have shown to the Father of our Nation.   


Mr. President,


	Our ties are described as “all weather and time-tested friendship”. Nations do enjoy such warm sentiments, but rarely. And when that happens, relationship grows in abundance and partnership gallops with pace. Today, Zambia and India share a multifaceted relationship. Our economic ties are on the upswing. We find a perfect match between India’s growth and Zambia’s capacity. Our trade and investment ties have brought prosperity to our two peoples. For decades, Indian companies have had a home in Zambia.  Many more wish to partner you in your progress. I am confident that you will continue to support them as they work to contribute to Zambia’s growth and development.  


Mr. President, 


	Our people and our youth have similar aspirations. They wish to lead the world on innovation, smart solutions, next-generation technologies, green growth and more. We must exchange knowledge and skills to fulfil their aspirations.  Smart Zambia and Digital India could not be better partners for each other. Today, we have made a new beginning in our digital collaboration. I hope our tele-education and tele-medicine expertise would create new opportunities for the youth in Zambia. 


Mr. President, 


	Our political relations are deep. Our economic ties are growing. Our defence and security ties must also keep pace. I am happy that today we have expanded our defence cooperation. And along with it, we have yet again renewed our mutual commitment to securing ourselves, and the world, from the scourge of terrorism.
	Mr. President, no word on Zambia-India friendship is complete without our people. They have been the real champions of our relationship. Be it the Indian community in Chipata or the Zambian students in Chennai, the cultural understanding that they have developed with people around them is truly remarkable. They savour pap with spinach and relish biryani with masala with equal delight! We surely could not have asked for more.   
	As two ancient societies, our people show deep reverence for nature. On my visit to Zambia, I was most delighted to visit the world famous Victoria Falls.  May the energy of Victoria Falls, what you affectionately call Mosi-Oa-Tunya, and the embrace of the Himalayas continue to inspire us as we forge new bonds of friendship!   



	With these words, Mr President, I wish you and your people peace, progress and prosperity. And I wish our two countries everlasting friendship. 


 

Thank you.

                Dear Fellow Citizens


	I offer you my greetings on the eve of our 73rd Independence Day. This is a happy and emotional day for all children of Mother India, whether living at home or abroad. Weremember with gratitude the countless freedom fighters and revolutionaries who struggled, strived and made heroic sacrifices to win us our freedom from colonial rule.


 


	We complete 72 years as a free nation at a very special juncture. In a few weeks from now, on October 2nd, we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of ourNation, Mahatma Gandhi, the guiding light of our successful effort to liberate our nation and of our continuing effort to reform our society of all inequities.


 


	Contemporary India is very different from the India in which Mahatma Gandhi lived and worked. Even so, Gandhiji remains extremely relevant. In his advocacy of sustainability, ecological sensitivity and living in harmony with nature, he anticipated pressing challenges of our times. When we design and deliver welfare programmes for our disadvantaged fellow citizens and families, when we seek to harness the power of the sun as renewable energy, we put Gandhian philosophy into action.


 


	This year also marks the 550th birth anniversary of one of the greatest, wisest and most influential Indians of all time – Guru Nanak Devji. He was the founder of Sikhism, but the reverence and respect he commands go far beyond just our Sikh brothers and sisters. They extend to millions of others in India and across the world. My best wishes to them on this pious occasion.


 

Fellow Citizens


	The illustrious generation that led us to freedom did not perceive independence only in terms of transfer of political power. They considered it a stepping stone in a longer and larger process of nation building and national welding. Their objective was to improve the life of each individual, each family and of society as a whole.


 


	In this backdrop, I am confident that the recent changes made in Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh would be of immense benefit to those regions. They will enable the people to access and enjoy the same rights, same privileges and same facilities as their fellow citizens in the rest of the country. These include progressive, egalitarian laws and provisions related to the Right to Education; accessing public information through the Right to Information; reservations in education and employment and other facilities for traditionally deprived communities; and justice for our daughters by abolishing unequal practices such as instant triple talaq.


 


	Earlier this summer, the people of India participated in the 17th general election, the largest democratic exercise in human history. For this I must congratulate our voters. They turned up at polling stations in large numbers and with much enthusiasm. They gave expression to their electoral right as well as their electoral responsibility.


 


	Every election marks a new beginning. Every election is the renewal of India’s collective hope and optimism – a hope and optimism that can be compared, I would say, to what we experienced on August 15, 1947. Now it is for all of us, everybody in India, to work together and take our cherished nation to new heights.


 


	In this regard, I am happy to note that the recently concluded session of Parliament saw lengthy and productive sittings of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Many important Bills were passed, in a spirit of cross-party cooperation and constructive debate. I am confident this is only an indicator of what the coming five years have in store. I also urge that this culture percolates to all our legislative assemblies.


 


	Why is this important? It is important not merely because the elected must be equal to the trust placed in them by their electors. It is also important because nation building –a continuous process, of which Independence was a key milestone – requires every institution and every stakeholder to work in tandem, to work in harmony and to work in togetherness. Nation building, at the end of the day, is about creating that optimal partnership between voters and their representatives, between citizens and their government, and between civil society and state.


 


	The state and the government have an important role here, as a facilitator and an enabler. As such, it is critical for our key institutions and the policy makers to study and appreciate the message being sent by citizens and to be responsive to the thoughts and wishes of our people. As the President of India, it is my privilege to travel all over our country, to our diverse states and regions, and meet fellow Indians from all walks of life. Indians can be very different in their tastes and habits, but Indians share the same dreams. Before 1947, the dreams were for a free India. Today, the dreams are for accelerated development; for effective and transparent governance; and yet for a smaller footprint of government in our everyday lives.


 


	Fulfilling these dreams is essential. Any reading of the mandate of the people would make their aspirations clear. And while the government inevitably has its part to play, I would argue that the greater opportunity and ability lies in the skill, talent, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship of 1.3 billion Indians. These attributes are not new. They have kept India going and have nurtured our civilisation for thousands of years. There have been times in our long history when our people encountered hardships and challenges. Even on such occasions, our society proved to be resilient; common families showed uncommon courage; and so many determined individuals found the strength to survive and to thrive. Today, given a facilitative and enabling environment by the government, we can only imagine what our people can achieve.


 


	The government can build financial infrastructure in the form of a transparent, inclusive banking system, an online-friendly tax system and easier access to capital for legitimate entrepreneurs. The government can build physical infrastructure in the formof housing for the poorest of the poor, and availability of energy, toilets and water in every home. The government can build institutional infrastructure to address the paradox of floods and calamities in some parts of the country, and water scarcity in other parts. The government can build connectivity infrastructure in the form of wider, better highways and safer, faster trains; airports in the interiors of our country, and ports that dot our coasts. And near universal data access that allows common citizens to benefit from Digital India.


 


	The government can build social infrastructure in the form of a comprehensive healthcare programme, and facilities and provisions for the mainstreaming of our Divyang fellow citizens. The government can build legal infrastructure by enacting laws that advance gender equality, as well as by removing obsolete laws to make life easier for our people.


 


	However, what is more crucial is for society and for citizens to use and nurture this infrastructure – for the benefit of themselves and their families, and for the benefit of society and us all.


 


	For example, rural roads and better connectivity have meaning only if farmers use them to reach bigger markets and get better prices for their produce. Fiscal reforms and easier regulations for business have meaning only if our entrepreneurs, whether small start-ups or big industrialists, use these to build honest and imaginative enterprises and create sustainable jobs. Universal availability of toilets and household water have meaning only if they empower the women of India, enhance their dignity and become a catalyst for them to go out into the world and achieve their ambitions. They can achieve their ambitions as they choose: as mothers and homemakers – and as professionals and individuals with their own destiny.


 


	To cherish and safeguard such infrastructure – infrastructure that belongs to each one of us, the people of India – is to secure another aspect of our hard-won freedom. Civic-minded Indians respect and take ownership of such facilities and such infrastructure. And when they do so, they display the same spirit and resolve as the valiant men and women who serve in our Armed Forces and paramilitary and police forces. Whether you guard our nation at the frontiers or check that hand before it throws a stone at a passing train or any other public property – just like that, for the sake of it; or perhapsin anger – in some measure you protect a shared treasure. This is not just a matter of obeying laws; it is of answering to an inner conscience.    


 

Fellow Citizens


	I have spoken so far of how state and society, government and citizen, must see each other and must cooperate with each other. I would like to turn to how we Indiansshould see one another – how we should have the same expectations from and regard for fellow citizens as we would expect them to have from and for us. Through the millennia and through the centuries, India has rarely been a judgemental society. Rather, it has had an easy-going, live-and-let-live organising principle. We respect each other’s identity – whether born of region, language or faith; or even the absence of faith. India’s history and destiny, India’s legacy and future, are a function of coexistence and conciliation, of reform and reconciliation – of expanding our hearts and embracing the ideas of others.


 


	This spirit of cooperation is what we bring to our diplomatic endeavours as well, as we gladly share our experiences and our strengths with partner countries in every continent. At home and abroad, in domestic discourse and in foreign policy, let us always be conscious of the magic and uniqueness of India.


 


	We are a young country, a society increasingly defined and shaped by our youth. The energies of our young are being channelized in so many directions – in a quest for excellence from sport to science, from scholarship to soft skills. This is heart-warming. Nevertheless, the greatest gift we can give our young and our coming generations is to encourage and institutionalise a culture of curiosity – especially in the classroom. Let us listen to our children – for through them the future whispers to us.


 


	I say this with the confidence and belief that India will never lose its capacity to listen to the feeblest voice; that it will never lose sight of its ancient ideals; that it will forget neither its sense of fairness nor its sense of adventure. We Indians are a people who dare to explore the moon and Mars. We are also a people who persevere to create a loving habitat for three of every four wild tigers on our planet, because it is characteristic of Indianness to empathise with nature and with all living beings


 


	Over a hundred years ago, the inspirational poet Subramania Bharati gave voice to our freedom movement and its expansive goals in the following lines in Tamil: [I QUOTE]


 

 मंदरम् कर्पोम्, विनय तंदरम् कर्पोम् 

वानय अलप्पोम्, कडल मीनय अलप्पोम्

चंदिरअ मण्डलत्तु, इयल कण्डु तेलिवोम्

संदि, तेरुपेरुक्कुम् सात्तिरम् कर्पोम्

 

This can be interpreted as: [I QUOTE]

 

We will learn both scripture and science

We will explore both heavens and oceans

We will unravel the mysteries of the moon

And we will sweep our streets clean too [UNQUOTE]

 

Fellow Citizens,


	May those ideals and may that urge to learn and to listen and to become better, may that curiosity and may that fraternalism, always be with us. May it always bless us, and always bless India.


 


	With that, I once more wish you and your families all the very best on the eve of Independence Day.


 

Thank You

Jai Hind!

He said that in whatever capacity they may be in this country, each one of them has earned respect and a name for themselves and for India. 

The President said that we see our Diaspora as an integral part of our transformative journey. Through their ideas, enterprise and on-ground presence in Guinea, they can foster growth and development in India. He assured them that we stand by them, firmly and strongly, when they need us.

The President dedicated this honour to the people of India, to their respect and regard for the Guinean people and to Guinea-India friendship.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the National Assembly of The Gambia yesterday (July 31, 2019) in Banjul. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India and Africa share the same development challenges and are both driven by similar imperatives. Africa’s economic projection and India’s growth can complement each other. Our trade and investment relations are growing. Our bilateral trade stood at over US$ 62 billion for 2017-18. India has become the fifth largest investor in Africa with cumulative investments at over US$ 54 billion. The African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement launched this month will make Africa the largest free trade area in the world. India views this development as yet another opportunity to boost economic ties with Africa. 

The President said that our development cooperation, based on African priorities and sustainable partnerships, is a key feature of our engagement with the continent. After South Asia, the African continent is the largest recipient of Indian overseas assistance. 181 Lines of Credit have been extended to 41 countries for a total amount of US$ 11 billion. Our projects have made a great difference to the quality of life of the African people, all over the African continent.

The President said that India cherishes its privileged development partnership with The Gambia.  India has, in keeping with The Gambian priorities, extended support for its social and economic progress - from capacity building, financial assistance to implementing infrastructure projects.  India has provided concessional lines of credit worth US$ 78.5 million to support programs of rural development, agriculture, drinking water, healthcare and setting up physical infrastructure of The Gambia. Another line of credit of US$ 92 million has been extended. Each year, we receive young Gambians in India for education, for skilling and for navigating the digital world. We remain committed to strengthening The Gambian capacity to build institutions and help democracy deliver. 

Later in the evening (July 31, 2019), the President addressed the Indian community at a Reception hosted by Shri Rajeev Kumar, Ambassador of India to Senegal and Gambia.  

Addressing the gathering, the President said that in our quest for development and growth, the overseas Indian community is an invaluable partner. We are keen to connect with them deeper and stronger. To support our Diaspora abroad, we have a special focus to make public service delivery smooth, hassle-free and efficient.  We have undertaken several measures to make it easier to obtain passport, consular documents and OCI cards. To reach those in need, we have employed social media, apps and digital platforms for quicker and targeted service. 

The President noted that the Indian community has always risen to the occasion whenever called for help by the local government. During the Ebola crisis in this region, the community contributed handsomely to The Gambian government efforts for emergency assistance. Whenever the National Hospital in The Gambia has had a shortage of medicines or consumables, the community has got together and provided the same. 

Today (August 1, 2019), the President will leave for the Republic of Guinea – the last leg of his three nations visit to Benin, The Gambia and Guinea. Before leaving for Guinea, the President will inaugurate an exhibition on Mahatma Gandhi and Khadi in Banjul.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has visited India’s longest electrified tunnel between Cherlopalli and Rapuru railway stations in Andhra Pradesh today.

Calling it a feather in the glory of Indian Railways, the Vice President said that the 6.7- km long tunnel provides viable rail connectivity between Krishnapatnam Port and its hinterland for goods train services and facilitates seamless freight transport.

Describing the structure as an engineering marvel, Shri Naidu lauded Indian Railways for completing the longest electrified tunnel in a record time. Built at an estimated cost Of Rs 437 Cr, the tunnel has 44 Trolley Refuges and 14 Cross Passages.

Saying that he was overwhelmed with happiness after traveling in the newly commissioned Obulavaripalli-Krishnapatnam line, the Vice President turned emotional to have witnessed his long-cherished childhood dream come to fruition.

“I am emotional because it passes through my native and ancestral villages where I had spent my childhood. At that time nobody had even imagined that a train would be passing through these hillocks one day. When I was minister this line was envisaged, planned, surveyed and sanctioned. It is finally completed when I am the vice president now,” he added.

The Vice President was accompanied by his spouse Smt. Usha Naidu.

Shri Naidu recalled that in view of the importance of Krishnapatnam port-Obulavaripalle line for the development of the region, he had mooted the idea when Shri Nitish Kumar was the Railways Minister in Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s cabinet. He said that he had been pursuing it since then. When I was a Minister in Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s Cabinet this line was envisaged, he added.

This newly commissioned line of 112 km reduces the travel time to five hours as compared to the 10 hrs earlier for a goods train from Krishnapatnam Port to Obulavaripalli. It also reduces the distance by 72 kms for the trains coming from Guntakal Division to Krishnapatnam and reduces traffic density in Obulavaripalle - Renigunta - Gudur section.

It will facilitate operating freight trains on Obulavaripalli-Venkatachalam-Krishnapatnam Port while providing the shortest path between Chennai-Howrah and Chennai-Mumbai rail routes.

The new line will ease congestion of both passenger, and freight carrying trains in Vijayawada - Gudur - Renigunta - Guntakal sections. Significant growth in freight traffic is expected and it helps these hinterland areas in socio-economic growth.

The Vice President said that the launch of passenger services between Venkatachalam and Rapur would fulfill the long-cherished wish of the people.

Shri Naidu complimented the Railway Minister, Shri Piyush Goyal and the Railway Board for accepting his suggestion to start the passenger services between Venkatachalam and Rapuru.

The Minister of State for Railways, Shri Suresh Angadi, Smt. Usha Naidu and other senior Officials of Railway were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" I am delighted to visit the country’s longest electrified tunnel between Cherlopalli and Rapuru railway stations constructed in a horseshoe design.

This 6.7- km long tunnel constructed at a cost of Rs 437 Cr and has 44 Trolley Refuges and 14 Cross Passages has been rightly described as an engineering marvel. The tunnel opens viable rail connectivity between Krishnapatnam Port and its hinterland for goods train services and facilitates seamless freight transport

I am overwhelmed with emotion as I have travelled on this newly commissioned Obulavaripalli-Krishnapatnam line fulfilling my long-cherished childhood dream. The completion of the longest electrified tunnel in a record time has further enhanced my happiness.  

I am emotional because it passes through my native village and ancestral where I had spent my childhood. At that time nobody had even imagined that a train would be passing these hillocks one day. When I was minister this line was envisaged, planned , surveyed and sanctioned  and finally completed when I am the vice president now.

The new line covering a total length of 112 km has been completed at a cost of around Rs.1993 crore with nine stations along the route, 146 bridges, 60 road under bridges and two tunnels ( 1 km and 6.7 km). A salient feature is that it has no level crossings. 

I am overwhelmed with emotion as I have travelled on this newly commissioned Obulavaripalli-Krishnapatnam line fulfilling my long-cherished childhood dream. The dedication of the longest electrified tunnel in a record time has further enhanced my happiness.  

This newly commissioned line of 112 km reduces the travel time to five hours as compared to the 10 hrs earlier for a goods train from Krishnapatnam Port to Obulavaripalli. 

It also reduces distance by 72 kms for the trains coming from Guntakal Division to Krishnapatnam and reduces traffic density in Obulavaripalle - Renigunta - Gudur section. 

It will facilitate operating freight trains on Obulavaripalli-Venkatachalam-Krishnapatnam Port while providing shortest path between Chennai-Howrah and Chennai-Mumbai rail routes. 

The new line will ease congestion of both passenger carrying and freight carrying trains in Vijayawada - Gudur - Renigunta - Guntakal sections. 

Significant growth in the freight traffic is expected and helps these hinterland areas in socio-economic growth. 

Passenger Amenities at all Railway stations from Krishnapatnam to Rapuru:

At present, Krishnapatnam – Venkatachalam railway line is catering to the needs of the freight customers. In addition to serving the freight customer needs, upon my suggestion  the minister has agreed for operating passenger services also o­n this route, to give an added advantage to the general public of this region and to provide additional traveling facility for the people. Provision of various passenger amenities at all the Railway stations from Krishnapatnam to Rapuru are in progress.

O­nce passenger services start in this new line, it will provide safe and economic mode of transport for the people of this area.

I congratulate the Ministry of Railways, especially the South Central Railway (SCR) for executing this project through a special purpose vehicle  viz., Krishnapatnam Railway Company Limited (KRCL) consisting of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, Krishnapatnam Port, Government of Andhra Pradesh, Sagar Mala Development Corporation, and NMDC.

I appreciate all the officers, engineers, electricians and workers for completing this mammoth project in a record time of 43 months.

In view of the importance of Krishnapatnam port-Obulavaripalle line for the development of the region, I had first taken up the proposal when Nitish Kumar was Railways Minister in Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s cabinet and had been pursuing it since then.

The launch of passenger services between Venkatachalam and Rapur would fulfill the long-pending demand of passengers of seven stations. I thank the Railway Minister, Shri Piyush Goyal and the Railway Board for accepting my suggestion to start the passenger services between Venkatachalam and Rapuru.

 

Jaihind. Thank you!

Hailing the hard work, dedication, and commitment of the 24 year old Badminton star, he said that she was a great inspiration to all the countrymen.

Complimenting Sindhu for following strict diet and undertaking rigorous and disciplined practice to achieve her goals, Shri Naidu said that the Fit India call given by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi should become a national movement. ‘Fit India is apt, timely and most needed’, he added.

The Vice President said that India has a great demographic dividend with 65% of its population below 35 years of age and observed that it was necessary to have a healthy, active and productive young work force to take the country to greater heights.

The Vice President said efforts such as Fit India are extremely relevant at a time when non-communicable diseases are on the rise due to modern lifestyles and dietary habits.

He pointed out that fitness of the body and mind would not only keep individuals alert and smart but would also give them strength to achieve their goals and become true assets to the society.

He stressed that only a healthy nation can become a wealthy nation.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for bringing about the much-needed reforms in international political, financial and business institutions to make them more representative of the ground realities.

Addressing the inaugural session of ‘Deccan Dialogue II - Economic Diplomacy in the Age of Disruptions’ at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, he said that India supports a rules-based multilateral order to tackle many common challenges such as climate change, technology divide, trade disputes, terrorism, connectivity and maritime threats.

Observing that India and other developing countries when faced with issues of unilateralism and protectionism had made a clarion call to reform the multilateral system so that developing countries have a greater say in global governance, he said “what we need is reformed multilateralism to face the headwinds of protectionist tendencies”. 

Pointing out that India represented 1/6th of the global population, the Vice President also called for enlarging and democratizing the UN Security Council.

Stating that the 21st century was being hailed as the Asian century and India has a key role to play in promoting peace, security and development in Asia and beyond, the Vice President said enhanced regional connectivity, both physical and digital, can boost trade and play a pivotal role in bringing prosperity and development.

However, such initiatives to be successful and sustainable should be transparent, inclusive and respect the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.

In this context, he said that India believed in peaceful co-existence and was not a war monger. “We don’t want anybody to interfere in our internal affairs”, he asserted and added that India would give a befitting reply if anybody tried to interfere in its internal affairs.

Shri Naidu said that embracing new technologies was a must for developing countries to leap-frog into the 4th industrial revolution and to positively transform the lives of people. “For this to happen, we need to look at appropriate frameworks for international cooperation at the global and regional levels that can avoid the digital divide and ensure that the 4th industrial revolution is an inclusive one”, he stressed.

The Vice President also asserted that India stands for an open, secure, stable, accessible and non-discriminatory environment for ICT and digital technologies. India upholds the centrality of the United Nations in discussions on ICT-related security issues, he added.

Pointing out that the world was more connected than ever before in this era of globalization, Shri Naidu said “the Global Village we have grown accustomed to is rapidly changing in unprecedented ways. This swiftly changing global geo-political and geo-economic landscape requires individual countries to come up with carefully strategized, dynamic and calibrated responses”.

Observing that the older patterns of trade and commerce were undergoing paradigm shift and that the rules-based, anti-discriminatory and the all-inclusive multilateral trading system was facing an uncertain future, he cautioned that such a situation would benefit no country. “But it is the developing countries which are feeling left out from the processes of economic cooperation and have to suffer the maximum consequences from the fallout”, he added.

In the face of the ongoing transformations, the Vice President said it becomes all the more important that we support the efforts towards making global governance more representative by ensuring greater participation of emerging markets and developing countries in global decision-making.

He said that India was the world’s sixth largest economy, contributing over 15% to the global economic growth, and was poised to contribute to the global economic strength for the next many decades.

The Vice President said that India was placing special focus on improving connectivity infrastructure with neighboring countries both at the bilateral level and through regional forums like BIMSTEC and Indian Ocean Region (IOR) for expanding intra-regional trade.

Asserting that India would support all efforts to keep oceans open, secure and free for the benefit of all, he said that India’s vision of Indo-Pacific was also rooted in advocacy of SAGAR- Security and Growth for All in the Region.

The Vice President said that during his official visits to Africa, Asia and Latin America, he had personally witnessed the tremendous potential for stronger economic and investment ties with countries of the South. “There are many complementarities, which can be harnessed for mutual benefit”, he added.

The Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri V. Muraleedharan, the Minister for Agriculture, Marketing and Civil Supplies, Telangana, Shri Niranjan Reddy, the Minister for Industries, Commerce and Information Technology, Andhra Pradesh, Shri M. Gautam Reddy, the Additional Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, Shri P. Harish and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It is my great pleasure to be here today at the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad to inaugurate the second edition of Deccan Dialogue. 

I wish to congratulate both – the Ministry of External Affairs and the ISB for bringing together such a diverse and distinguished gathering on a common platform to deliberate on the important and topical challenges confronting all nations in the economic sphere.  

It is heartening to see the great interest and response this Dialogue has generated. Strengthening economic diplomacy as a means of driving growth within our own economy and promoting growth and development across countries is a key pillar of India’s foreign policy, and we have been making earnest efforts to strengthen it. 

We are living through an era of globalization wherein the world is more connected than ever before. It is also true, however, that the “Global Village” we have grown accustomed to is rapidly changing in unprecedented ways. This swiftly changing global geo-political and geo-economic landscape requires individual countries to come up with carefully strategized, dynamic and calibrated responses. 

 

Sisters and Brothers,

The older patterns of trade and commerce are in the process of an ongoing paradigm shift--the rules-based, anti-discriminatory and the all-inclusive multilateral trading system, centered around the UN, the WTO and the international law, is facing an uncertain future. 

This situation benefits no country, but it is the developing countries which are feeling left out from the processes of economic cooperation and have to suffer the maximum consequences from the fallout. 

In the face of the ongoing transformations, it becomes all the more important that we support the efforts towards making global governance more representative by ensuring greater participation of emerging markets and developing countries in global decision-making.

Irrespective of its failings and drawbacks, we must acknowledge that the processes of globalization opened up a world of possibilities. 

For a young, dynamic and developing country like India, globalization put the markets of the world within a reaching distance and combined with the process of economic liberalization undertaken by India, the job market that young Indians face today is fundamentally different from what it used to be a couple of decades ago. This became possible because we embraced the process of globalization and have striven to make it work for us. 

India is the world’s sixth largest economy, contributing over 15% to the global economic growth, and is poised to contribute to the global economic strength for the next many decades. 

As we all are aware, the 21st century is being hailed as the Asian century and India has a key role to play in promoting peace, security and development in Asia and beyond.  

India supports a rules-based multilateral order to tackle many common challenges such as climate change, technology divide, trade disputes, terrorism, connectivity and maritime threats. But when we are faced with issues of unilateralism and protectionism, we need to be conscious of the fact that it was India and other developing countries which had earlier made a clarion call to reform the multilateral system as it exists so that developing countries have a greater voice in global governance.  Consequently, it is not our case to go back to the status quo on multilateralism.  

What we need is reformed multilateralism to face the headwinds of protectionist tendencies.  We need to bring about the much-needed reforms in international political, financial and business institutions so that they are more representative of the ground realities and adept to respond to new challenges. 

Enhanced regional connectivity, both physical and digital, can boost trade and play a pivotal role in bringing prosperity and development. However, for such initiatives to be successful and sustainable they should be transparent, inclusive and respect the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. 

India on its part is placing special focus on improving connectivity infrastructure with neighboring countries both at the bilateral level and through regional forums like BIMSTEC and Indian Ocean Region (IOR) for expanding intra-regional trade. India’s vision of Indo-Pacific is also rooted in advocacy of SAGAR- Security and Growth for All in the Region. India will support all efforts to keep oceans open, secure and free for the benefit of all. 

During my official visits to Africa, Asia and Latin America, I have personally witnessed the tremendous potential for stronger economic and investment ties with countries of the South. There are many complementarities, which can be harnessed for mutual benefit. 

Effective economic diplomacy with a development approach is key to materialize this potential. India has always emphasized that economic engagement should not push countries into debt traps or restrict the space for their development.  Development partnerships should be based on sustainable models, on terms that are reasonable and appropriate, and are guided by local priorities and capacities. 

The support offered by India under our Development Partnership program to countries in Africa and Latin America is also increasingly covering critical areas of education, energy and skill development and disruptive technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, issues of cyber security etc.  

Thus, we have brought in e-ITEC programme, Tele-medicine and Tele Education and the Pan-Africa e-network project.  These are the areas which have been overlooked by traditional development partners of Africa. But India is now focused on working on improving these very critical dimensions of our development partnership. 

 

Sisters and Brothers,

Technology played a key role in shaping the current economic and trade system. The rapid global economic integration witnessed in the last 2-3 decades was essentially fuelled by the IT revolution. New digital technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things can provide the much-needed stimulus for reviving global economic activity. At the same time, we must be aware that they may exacerbate the technology/digital divide and lead to compartmentalization of global trade due to legitimate concerns relating to security and control over these technologies. 

India believes that embracing new technologies is a necessity for developing countries to leap-frog into the 4th industrial revolution era and also to positively transform the lives of people. For this to happen, we need to look at appropriate frameworks for international cooperation at the global and regional levels that can avoid the digital divide and ensure that the 4th industrial revolution is an inclusive one. 

In this context, it would be pertinent to reiterate that India stands for an open, secure, stable, accessible and non-discriminatory environment for ICT and digital technologies and upholds the centrality of the United Nations in discussions on ICT-related security issues. 

India welcomes the establishment of a UN open-ended working group on this matter, as well as the launch of a new edition of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE). 

Technology partnerships should also promote innovation and indigenization so that the benefits are sustainable. This is directly related to capacity building and appropriate skilling of human resources. Cooperation in higher education and technical training become crucial in this context. I am glad to note that you will deliberate on both these topics during the course of today's Dialogue. 

I am sure you would have noted the relevance of holding this dialogue in the city of Hyderabad. Hyderabad has been the center of disruptions which are driving innovations in the country, and striving to fulfill the varied promises of the digital age. T-Hub, one-of-its-kind, largest incubator for start-ups is headquartered in the city and has been pivotal in providing our companies with an innovation-driven ecosystem. 

Hyderabad is one of the first cities in India to witness the growth of the IT/ITeS sector and contributes more than 11% to the country’s IT exports. Additionally, Hyderabad is also witnessing a rapid growth in the pharma, biotechnology and medical technology sectors, with the Genome Valley near Hyderabad as one of Asia’s premium biotechnology and research and development hubs. Today, Hyderabad has emerged as the choice of destination for life sciences companies of all sizes given its talent pool, vibrant life sciences and technology ecosystem, presence of premier research institutes, availability of ready-to-occupy laboratory space and proactive government support.

To conclude, I would like to say that despite the challenging times, I remain optimistic that we can collectively overcome the new and emerging barriers to global trade and economic engagement, and workout innovative and sustainable solutions that are acceptable to all. I hope your deliberations today will contribute to this exercise. 

I wish all success to the Dialogue. And also, I wish that you get an opportunity to explore the Deccan part of the Deccan Dialogue after the Dialogue itself, and explore the many treats that the city of Hyderabad has to offer. 

 

Thank you!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that environmentally friendly aquaculture can serve as a vehicle for rural development, food and nutritional security for the rural masses, considering the substantial contribution aquaculture makes towards socio-economic development in terms of income and employment.

 

Shri Naidu was inaugurating the 5th AQUA AQUARIA INDIA 2019, India’s International Aquaculture Show, organized by the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), in Hyderabad today.

 

Endorsing the call given by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for Fit India, the Vice President said that it is the need of the hour and has to become a national movement. Intake of food rich in proteins, such as fish, is crucial for good health, he added.

 

Referring to the slogan given by the former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee, 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and Jai Vigyan', Shri Naidu said that we must salute the Soldiers for guarding our borders, we must salute the farmer for producing food for us and we must salute the Scientists for making India scientifically advanced.

 

Highlighting the government’s resolve to double farmers’ income by 2022, the Vice President underscored the necessity of ensuring that the economic benefits from fisheries reach the primary producers, the fishermen and fish farmers. ‘We must reduce the role of middlemen, provide crop insurances, enhance access to credit, develop cold chains and good upcountry market linkages, provide infrastructure for post-harvest storage, handling and value addition’, he added.

 

Cautioning that reckless exploitation of limited resources, especially endangered marine species must be strictly prevented, the Vice President stressed that the promotion, regulation and monitoring of responsible fishing practices, through robust fisheries management and governance frameworks are essential for the sustainability of fisheries resources in both coastal areas and high seas.

 

The Vice President said that the burning concerns of marine and fresh water pollution caused by discarded plastics and harmful chemicals must be addressed on priority basis. Referring to the looming threats of global warming and climate change, he called for a coordinated response to tackle these issues. ‘Sustainability and conservation must be the twin pillars on which we build our fisheries sector’, he exhorted.

 

Speaking of India’s enormous potential in the fisheries sector, the Vice President stated that India is the second largest fish producer in the world with a production of 13.70 Million Metric Tons of fish during 2018-19. 

 

Reasoning that the rising world population is putting further pressure on the available food resources, the Vice President said that there was an urgent need to boost fish production to ensure food security to our billion-strong population.

 

Shri Naidu said that with a long coastline of over 8000 Kms and exploitable fisheries resources of 3.9 million Metric Tons, India is blessed with vast aquatic resources with a rich diversity of fish fauna for sustainable utilization. He added that India’s vast and diverse aquatic resources offered an excellent opportunity for expansion of aquaculture.

 

The Vice President also pointed out that globally, aquaculture is being looked upon as the best alternative to boost fish production, as the production from the traditional and marine fisheries have been stagnating.

 

Expressing concern that India exploits only a fraction of the aquaculture potential that is available to it, he said that there is room for both horizontal and vertical expansion in the fisheries sector. He also spoke about the immense potential India has in the field of mariculture.

 

Referring to the need for diversifying aquaculture, Shri Naidu said that cage culture in floating or fixed cages and pen culture would help us meet this objective. The Vice President suggested that our future outlook must focus not on increasing our fishing efforts in the seas, but on judicious use of the declining fishery resources by reducing losses and focusing on value addition.

 

Stating that fisheries and aquaculture are multidisciplinary subjects where scientists and technologists have to work as teams, Shri. Naidu said that initiatives like Aqua Aquaria must not only serve as platforms for sharing knowledge and information on new technologies but also strive to take this knowledge to the common people, fish farmers and primary producers.

 

Referring to the role played by modern technology in enhancing production and productivity, the Vice President said that greater R&D support with strong linkages between research and development agencies was the need of the hour.

 

He congratulated MPEDA for organizing the 3-day exposition and expressed hope that such events would help giving a renewed impetus to the sector by infusing new ideas and advanced technology.

 

The Vice President inaugurated the MPEDA-RGCA Exhibition and the Business to Business Exhibition and went around the same.

 

The Minister for Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Marketing, Andhra Pradesh, Shri Mopidevi Venkata Ramana Rao, the Minister for Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, Telangana, Shri T. Srinivasa Yadav, the Chairman, MPEDA, Shri K.S. Srinivas and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am delighted to inaugurate the 5th AQUA AQUARIA INDIA, India’s International Aquaculture Show, organized by the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA).

Fisheries is close to my heart. A great part of my public life has been entwined with activities related to the welfare of the coastal people in my home state, Andhra Pradesh.

As you know, Asia is the largest fish producer in the world and in 2016, 85 % of the global population engaged in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors was in Asia.

In India, only after independence in 1947,was fisheries recognized as a sector with great potential for growth. Mechanization commenced in the 1950s, which has revolutionized harvest and post-harvest activities.

Today, India is the second largest fish producer in the world with a production of 13.70 Million Metric Tons of fish during 2018-19.    

 

Fish constituted about 10 % of total exports from India and almost 20% of agriculture exports in 2017-18.  With export earnings of US $ 7 Billion, India is the 4th largest exporter of fish in the world. 

 

Apart from exporting marine products worth more than Rs.47,600 crore, the sector also provides employment opportunities to more than 14.5 million people, residing in remote villages of the Indian coast. 

 

Contribution of fisheries to the GDP is about 1% and about 5.37 % to the Agricultural GDP. 

 

The world fish production through capture and culture fisheries in the marine as well as freshwater regimes, was estimated to be about 178.8 million Metric Tons.  Out of this, the food fish production was estimated at 157.9 million Metric Tons.   

 

The world population is ever increasing and the rising food demand is putting further pressure on the available food resources.  

 

Hence, the need to boost fish production is felt now, more than ever to ensure food security to our billion-strong population.

 

Since over 16% of animal protein supplies originate from the fisheries sector, the sector is identified as a major factor contributing to food security.  

 

The Global Per Capita Food Fish consumption is estimated at 20.7 kg/per annum.  Out of this 11.4 Kg (55%) is contributed by Aquaculture and rest by capture fishery.  

 

India is blessed with vast aquatic resources with a rich diversity of fish fauna for sustainable utilization.

 

Our country harbors about 2,200 species of fish, which accounts for about 11% of all the fish species reported globally.  

With a long coastline of over 8000 Kms, 2.02 Million Sq. Km. of Exclusive Economic Zone, 0.5 Million Sq. Km of continental shelf area, India is estimated to have exploitable fisheries resources of 3.9 million Metric Tons of which only about 3.0 million Metric Tons are presently exploited.  

Further, about 1.2 million hectares of potential brackish water area suitable for aquaculture and 5.4 Million hectares of area are available for Freshwater aquaculture in the country.   

India’s vast and diverse aquatic resources offer excellent opportunity for expansion of aquaculture foodfish production.

My dear sisters and brothers,

It is a fact that globally aquaculture is being looked upon as the best alternative to boost fish production, as the production from the traditional sector has been stagnating.  

It is a matter of great concern that India exploits only a fraction of the aquaculture potential that is available to it.

India utilizes only about 40 percent of the available 2.36 million hectares of ponds and tanks for freshwater aquaculture and about 15 percent of a total potential brackish water resource of 1.2 million hectares. 

In  other words there is room for both horizontal and vertical expansion of these sectors. 

With over 8 000 km of coastline there is immense potential for the development of mariculture which has taken roots only in recent years with culture of mussels and oysters. 

Considering the substantial contribution aquaculture makes towards socio-economic development in terms of income and employment through the use of unutilized and underutilized resources in several regions of the country, environmentally friendly aquaculture has been accepted as a vehicle for rural development, food and nutritional security for the rural masses. 

The systems of culture presently being adopted by Indian freshwater aqua culturists give yields varying from 1.5 to 4.5 Tons/ hectare/year.  

This productivity is much less in comparison to 10 to 15 Tons/hectare/ year in countries like China and Israel.

In our country, intensive fish culture with a production of 10-15 Tons has been carried out is only on experimental basis and its commercial adoption is a dream yet. 

Cage culture in floating or fixed cages is another option for diversifying. 

Diversity of our aquaculture environmental system offers suitable sites for pen culture also. 

Species like Tilapia, which has great demand in international markets can be cultured in freshwater environment by adopting diverse culture systems such as semi-intensive or intensive pond culture system, raceway system, cage culture systems etc. 

Currently, Shrimp is the major species cultured in the coastal aquaculture systems and constituted the export-oriented aquaculture sector in the country.  Commercial shrimp culture, which commenced in the early 1990s reached a peak in the year 2017-18 with the production of 7,00,000 MT of shrimp and scampi put together.  

The stupendous growth of shrimp culture was possible because Government of India permitted regulated introduction of Pacific White shrimpwith the objective of utilizing the potential of the species to cater to the global markets.  

My dear Sisters and brothers,

Most Asian countries are focusing on increasing fish production through advanced technological interventions, as there is a general understanding that production from marine capture fisheries does not promise much future in terms of quantity.

Studies have shown that catches from wild capture fisheries have actually been declining since peak global catches in the mid-1990s.

It is estimated that Primary production of the global ocean is expected to decline further by 6 % by 2100 and by 11 % in tropical zones.

Our future outlook must focus not on increasing our fishing efforts in the seas, but on judicious use of the declining fishery resources.

We need to focus on reducing losses and value addition and supplementing the ever-increasing need for fish through modern aquaculture technologies and diversification of the products.

On the one hand, we must focus on ensuring the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF). The promotion, regulation and monitoring of responsible fishing practices, through robust fisheries management and governance frameworks, are essential for the sustainability of fisheries resources in both coastal areas and high seas.

Reckless exploitation of limited resources, especially endangered marine species must be strictly prevented. 

We must also address burning concerns of pollution of marine and fresh water pollution. Discarded plastics and other residential waste, discharge from pesticides and industrial chemicals eventually find their way into our water bodies with devastating consequences for aquatic life and the habitats they depend on.

The looming threats of global warming and climate change would certainly have adverse effects on marine and aquatic habitats and life forms.

There is a need to respond to climate change in a coordinated manner across all food systems, to ensure opportunities are maximized and negative impacts reduced, and to secure food and livelihood provision.

Sustainability and conservation must be the twin pillars on which we build our fisheries sector.

My dear sisters and brothers,

It isalso necessary to ensure that much of the economic benefits from both capture fisheries and aquaculture reach the primary producers, i.e. the fishers and fish farmers.

We need to place special emphasis on initiatives which will improve the economic condition of farmers.

A number of interventions are needed.

We must, for example, reduce the role of middlemen, provide crop insurances, enhance access to credit, develop cold chains and good upcountry market linkages, provide infrastructure for post-harvest storage, handling and value addition.

I am aware that all essential technological support is being provided by the eight Fisheries Research Institutes under Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), several other mandated organizations like the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) and numerous NGOs such as the Asian Fisheries Society Indian Branch (AFSIB). However, much more needs to be done to spread awareness and provide services to the farmers.

Fisheries and Aquaculture are multidisciplinary subjects where scientists and technologists have to work as teams. Gatherings such as this one should focus not only serve as platforms for sharing knowledge and information on new technologies but alsostrive to take this knowledge to the common people, fish farmers and primary producers.

Greater R&D support with strong linkages between research and development agencies, increased investment in fish and shrimp hatcheries, diversified aquaculture species, establishment of aquaculture estates, feed mills and ancillary industries have all been identified as important areas for maintaining the pace of growth of the sector.

 

Policy decisions on the utilization of the off shore region for sea farming also is to be taken into account. 

 

Aquaculture should be streamlined through a set of regulations, codes of practices for various sub-sectors with suitable penal provisions for violation.  

 

Activities and responsibilities of different institutes working for development of aquaculture with different plans and allocations also to be defined to avoid ambiguity and duplication. 

 

The government of India is in the vanguard of transforming the economy andhas envisioned to double farmers’ incomes by 2022 through efforts to reduce costs and improve production, productivity and quality.

 

In order to achieve enhanced production and productivity and assure a decent farm gate price to the fishers and fish farmers and simultaneously provide the requisite impetus to the fisheries sector leading to a paradigm shift, there is imminent need for formulating and adopting multi-pronged strategies and interventions

 

I earnestly hope that all the discussions during the technical sessions will be directed towards sustainable development of aquaculture for optimal utilization of our resource potential. 

 

I congratulate MPEDA for organizing the 3 day exposition of this magnitude covering exposition and Technical sessions. Such events will help giving a renewed impetus to the sector by infusing new ideas and advanced technology.  I earnestly hope that all the discussions during the technical sessions will be directed towards sustainable development of aquaculture for optimal utilization of our resource potential.  I am glad to declare this event inaugurated and I wish the exposition all success.

 

Thank You!

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has stressed the need to create and nurture the culture of innovation in every organization to tap the individual and collective potential of employees.

Inaugurating the 33rd Convention of Quality Circle Forum of India, in Hyderabad today, he said it was the responsibility of the top level management or officers to promote team spirit, encourage new ideas and empower employs to express their opinions freely. He observed that organizations must create an enabling environment to bring out the innate potential of every person to solve problems and not accept the status quo.

Pointing out that there was an urgent need to ensure work-life balance in people’s lives, the Vice President expressed concern that the fast-paced, modern day lifestyle was causing an enormous stress and affecting people’s health and personal life.

Shri Naidu said that ensuring a healthy work life to employees must become the key focus of organizations along with achieving their profits. “While one cannot tolerate negligence, indiscipline or irresponsibility at work place, it is also the responsibility of an organization to ensure that the atmosphere does not jeopardize the personal life of employees,” he added.  

Stating that a healthy lifestyle, including proper dietary habits, was a must for a happy life, the Vice President advised people to find adequate time to spend with the family. Also, it is important to make yoga and meditation a part of one’s daily schedule. He also said that fitness improves quality of work and life as well.

Shri Naidu opined that it was important to engage our young and dynamic workforce in social service activities.

‘One must realize that country cannot make progress unless and until each and every section of the society is made a partner in India’s growth story,’ he added.    

The Vice President also called upon manufacturers of various products to ensure that most rigorous quality control, quality assurance and quality management practices are adopted to maintain the highest quality of products. “Á product can withstand competition only if it maintains good quality”, he added.

Shri Naidu said that to make quality a way of life, courses in quality control and other aspects related to it should be introduced in schools and colleges. He said that he would suggest this to the Union Minister for HRD.

The Vice President said that an education in quality concepts can help foster lateral thinking and prepare students for the work place of future. By inculcating lateral thinking, the students acquire ability to come up with need-based solutions to a given problem by thinking out of box, he added.

The Vice President also stressed the need for ensuring quality in selection and election of public representatives for better administration, discourse and debates in legislatures, decisions in governance and ultimately for the overall development of nation.

In this connection, he called upon all political parties to evolve a code of conduct for their public representatives at all levels from Panchayats to Parliament and said that there was a need to raise the quality of public discourse in the country.

Shri Naidu emphasized that election of leaders should be based on  4 Cs - Character, Caliber, Capacity and Conduct and  should not be based on the other 4Cs Cash, Caste, Community and Criminality.

Over 800 participants attending this convention and over 200 improvement projects are being presented in the convention.

The Chairman, Quality Circle Forum of India, Shri Ch. Balakrishna Rao and Shri P.S. Ram Mohan Rao, Former Governor and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Following is the text of the Vice President's address:


""I am delighted to be present here in Hyderabad today to inaugurate the 33rd convention of Quality Circle Forum of India. I was told that QCFI was formed as a non-profit body and registered under the Society Act, for the purpose of educating and training grass-root level employees for self and mutual development.

I was told that over 1000 participants are attending this convention and over 200 improvement projects are being presented in the convention here. My congratulations to all the participants and I wish them all a very fruitful and mutually beneficial event.

I am glad to know that Hyderabad Chapter is one of the oldest chapters of QCFI and was inaugurated by Late Shri N.T.Rama Rao, the former Chief minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1986.  Shri P.S. Rama Mohan Rao, former Governor of Tamil Nadu, is the founder Chairman of QCFI Hyderabad Chapter.

I am told that the primary thrust area of QCFI is to train grass root level employees to identify the chronic problems encountered in their work areas, analyse and find solutions by applying simple statistical problem-solving tools.

The underlying idea is that every individual has an intelligence of his own and when properly channelized, this can be used for creative and productive purposes. The quintessence of QCFI is to harness the unused potential hidden in every individual. 

I was told that QC philosophy helps to respect humanity and build a happy workplace. It also helps in improving productivity and communication between employees and the management. 

I am delighted that the QC teams present here are showcasing their improvement projects, which had enormously benefited their organizations. We need to create a culture of innovation and give a huge thrust to programmes like ‘Make in India’.

For creating a culture of innovation, it is important to tap the collective potential of multi-disciplinary teams, encourage those around you to build on the ideas of others and lead in a way that multiplies the capabilities of everyone in your organization. Those at the top should provide this kind of leadership.

Problems can be solved individually and also by working together. Perhaps working together can provide better results. Organizations must create an enabling environment to bring out the innate potential of every person to solve problems and not accept the status quo.

Promoting team spirit, encouraging new ideas, empowering employs to express their opinions freely would help everybody.

An organization can make important value additions to a product or service by giving importance to the feedback given by the customers.

Dear sisters and brothers,

An important aspect of the fast-paced, modern day lifestyle is the need to ensure work-life balance. Stress has become all pervasive and is affecting people’s health and personal life. Not having adequate time for oneself is not the ideal thing. One should find adequate time to spend with the family. Also, it is important to make  yoga and meditation a part of one’s daily schedule.

A healthy lifestyle, including proper dietary habits, is a must for a happy life. 

While one cannot tolerate negligence, indiscipline or irresponsibility at work place, it is also the responsibility of an organization to ensure that the atmosphere does not jeopardize the personal life of employees. Ensuring a healthy work life to employees must become the key focus of organizations along with achieving their own profits.

It is also important to engage our young and dynamic workforce in social service activities. In fact, I feel that a code of Professional Social Responsibility on the lines of Corporate Social Responsibility should be adopted by various professions, including doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants and others to take up specially focused activities to help the marginalized and downtrodden sections.

One must realize that country cannot make progress unless and until each and every section of the society is made partner in India’s growth story.

The 5S Concept of Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize and Sustain is aimed at improving overall efficiency at work place. This concept if implemented in true spirit in the industries, schools, hospitals, banks, colonies and house can pave the way for “Swatch Bharath”.

To make Quality a way of life, it should be introduced in schools and colleges.

An education in quality concepts can help foster lateral thinking and prepare students for the work place of future.

By inculcating lateral thinking, the students acquire ability to come up with need-based solutions to a given problem by thinking out of box.

The “Performance Stress” among student to acquire higher ranks will be greatly reduced by participating in group activities. To be successful in workplace, students should focus on team building and communication skills.

I urge the State Government and QCFI Hyderabad Chapter to take this work on a very large scale in Schools and Colleges for the benefit of our future generation. I am sure that it would also help in accelerating “Make in India”. It is extremely important for the products manufactured in India to meet the highest quality standards.

I am happy that QCFI has empowered and trained the professionals of our industry at all levels and helped in creating an effective work force that is helping the nation make rapid strides and helping the economy to grow.

Finally, before concluding, I would like to call upon all political parties to evolve a code of conduct for their public representatives at all levels from panchayats to Parliament. There is also a need to raise the quality of public discourse in the country.

My best wishes for all the future endeavours of the QCFI.

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India must always be wary of threats to national security as the country makes giant strides towards development with a booming economy.

Observing that a safe and secure environment was a necessary precondition for growth and development, he said “We must keep our defence preparedness at its peak always”.

Speaking at the Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering and Research (SAMEER) after visiting it’s Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) and EMI facilities, in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh today, the Vice President referred to the potential of EMP to disrupt, degrade and damage technology and critical infrastructure systems.

Shri Naidu “Human-made or naturally occurring EMPs can affect large geographic areas, disrupting elements critical to the nation’s security and economic prosperity and could adversely affect global commerce and stability”. Shri Naidu stressed that it was crucial that the country develops futuristic defence mechanisms and create EMP- resistant infrastructure to avert threats such as an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) attack.

Shri Naidu said that SAMEER with its vast experience in the areas of EMI, EMC and EMP could put the expertise to the benefit of Defence services, academic institutions, public and private industries.

The Vice President appreciated SAMEER for its frontline research in the areas of Radio Frequency/Microwave, Electromagnetic Interference, Compatibility and Pulse (EMI/EMC/EMP), millimetre wave technology, communications other areas.

Shri Naidu said that advancement in Science and Technology and a culture of innovation were of paramount importance for a nation to surge forward with greater momentum on the path to inclusive and sustainable development.

Referring to Official Telugu Language Day of Andhra Pradesh, the Vice President called upon the people to protect, preserve and promote their mother tongues or native languages. He suggested that the medium of education should be in local language up to primary level and also advised State Governments to issue all orders and communications in the languages.

Referring to the abrogation of Article 370, he said the decision was only an internal administrative arrangement.

Observing that India was a peace-loving country and not a warmonger, he said: “We don’t anybody to interfere in our internal affairs” and added that India would give a befitting reply if anybody tried to intervene in its affairs.

The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Youth Advancement of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Muttamsetti Srinivas Rao, Dr. Sulbha Ranade, Director-General SAMEER, Dr. B. Subba Rao, Program Director and officers of Indian Navy were present at the venue.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to be at the Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering and Research (SAMEER), Visakhapatnam, today.

It is a matter of great pleasure and pride for me to recall today, that I had laid the foundation stone for this facility in 2016 when I was the Minister for Urban Development. SAMEER, Vizag was set up with a mandate to achieve excellence in application -oriented research in the areas of Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3).

Today, I am extremely pleased to note than the construction and operationalization of this facility was completed in such a short span of time. I express my sincere appreciation to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for their diligent and dedicated work.

I am glad to know that SAMEER carries out frontline research in the areas of Radio Frequency/Microwave, Electromagnetic Interference, Compatibility and Pulse (EMI/EMC/EMP), millimetre wave technology, communications etc.

I am sure that this visit of mine and the interaction I had with you, will give me a better insight into this field of research and a clear understanding of the activities being carried out here and its outcomes.

I strongly believe that advancement in Science and Technology and a culture of innovation are of paramount importance if we are to surge forward with greater momentum on the path to inclusive and sustainable development.

In a quest to promote science and technology and innovation, I have been undertaking extensive visits to universities and research centres. In the last 2 years in office, I had visited nearly 100 such institutions and interacted with scientists, doctors, students, professors and young researchers.

Today, I visited EMP facilities and took stock of the ongoing work and the activities identified for the future. I have been apprised about the technological developments that have taken place and the knowledge we have gained in the broad domain of EMI/EMC and EMP.

I am glad to know that this Centre specializes in a variety of capabilities to cater to the increasing requirement from the strategic sectors. I am truly impressed with its capabilities.

I am happy to note that SAMEER, with its vast experience in the areas of EMI,EMC and EMP can put the expertise to the benefit of Defence services, academic Institutions, public and private industries.

An Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) has the potential to disrupt, degrade, and damage technology and critical infrastructure systems. Human-made or naturally occurring EMPs can affect large geographic areas, disrupting elements critical to the nation’s security and economic prosperity and could adversely affect global commerce and stability.

In a world ridden with conflicts, phenomena as powerful as electromagnetism can be misused and weaponised.

An EMP attack could affect car and truck engines, aircraft ignition systems, hospital equipment, pacemakers, commu­nications systems and electrical appliances. Road and rail signalling, industrial control applications and other electronic systems are all susceptible to EMP. Our smart cities which are run on Information and Communication Technologies are also extremely vulnerable to such threats.

Beyond critical infrastructure, the potentially devastating effects of an EMP could also directly or indirectly permeate the national security establishment, including the military and intelligence community, undermining their ability to respond to the national command authority and provide for the country’s security.

As India takes giant strides towards development with a booming economy that is seeing consistent and rapid progress across sectors, we must always be wary of such threats to our national security. We must keep our defence preparedness at its peak always. A safe and secure environment is a necessary precondition for growth and development.

It is therefore crucial that we develop futuristic defence mechanisms to this futuristic technology. The threat of an EMP attack necessitates the creation of infrastructure that is EMP- resistant.

I am happy that SAMEER has been working towards this objective, focusing on identifying critical functions and infrastructure at risk, improving the understanding of EMP effects, evaluating approaches to mitigating EMP effects, strengthening existing infrastructure to withstand EMPs and improving the response to EMPs.

Your research plays a critical role in fortifying national security.

I have also learnt that SAMEER has indigenously developed Linear Accelerator for Cancer therapy and established Stratosphere Troposphere (ST) Radar at the Guwahati University Campus.

In the present day world, capacity building and outreach are equally important.

I am pleased that SAMEER is giving prominence to the development of pool of skilled manpower in the area of EMI/EMC through regular workshops, seminars and other educational and academic events.

Dear sisters and brothers,

India has been a country where learning was given a central place in the society and knowledge has been handed down through the generations.

One of the oldest civilizations in the world, India has a strong tradition of science and technology. Ancient India was a land of sages and seers as well as a land of scholars and scientists.

From making the best steel in the world to teaching the world to count, India has been actively contributing to the field of science and technology centuries before modern laboratories were set up.

Many theories and techniques discovered by the ancient Indians have created and strengthened the fundamentals of modern science and technology.

Our Ayurveda system of medicine can be traced back to 5000 BC, Indus Valley Civilization had irrigation and sewerage systems as far back as 2500 BC. By 200 BC, South India was making high quality wrought iron and, of course, the invention of ‘zero’ and contributions to astronomy are well known.

Let us look at some of the invaluable contributions made by our ancestors. Aryabhatta’s ‘Aryabhattiyam’ is considered a seminal work; equally pioneering work is Panchasidhhantika of Varahamihira. Of course, Charaka and Sushruta are known as Fathers of Surgery. Rishi Kanad first spoke of “anu’’ (atom) as an indestructible particle of matter in Kanada Sutra, while Patanjali is considered as Father of Yoga. There are innumerable legendary scientists of ancient India who have enriched the world’s scientific treasure.

Unfortunately, today, we seem to be lagging behind advanced nations in technology and research indicators. While both are improving with time, we need to make greater progress.

I am sure that advancements in science and technology will spur economic growth, which in turn will lead to alleviation of poverty and the amelioration of other challenges from climate change to poverty faced by mankind. 

The Government of India has envisioned several initiatives to promote the growth of Science and Technology and Innovation in the Country.

From the National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI), an umbrella programme for nurturing ideas and innovations into successful start-ups to the women scientists scheme that promotes women in Science to the Atal Innovation Mission that seeks to transform the innovation landscape of the country, a number of path-breaking initiatives now fortify our science, technology and innovation ecosystems. 

We are also striving to turn our schools and universities into hubs of technology and innovation. Nearly 8800 schools have been provided with Atal Tinkering labs under the Atal Innovation Mission in order to hone scientific temperament and kindle curiosity among children.

We have crossed a number of frontiers when it comes to technology, especially in the case of Space technology. In addition to launching 104 satellites in one go in February, we also recently launched the Chandrayaan 2. Gaganyaan, India’s first human space mission is to be realized by the 75th anniversary of independence by 2022. The Solar Mission, Aditya L1 is also set to be launched in 2022.

India has also taken great strides in renewable energy technology with an installed capacity of 78 GW in 2019.

As a major producer and exporter of software technology, India has announced the National Policy on Software Products 2019 that seeks to nurture 10,000 technology start-ups and generate employment for 3.5 million people by 2025.

India has also gone digital with over 413 Crore digital transactions happening via BHIM UPI since 2016.

To keep up the pace of these transformations, in addition to an enabling policy environment and investment, our educational institutions must serve as centres for excellence in basic sciences as well as cutting edge technology. They must be at the forefront of our research initiatives so that they can propel technology adaptation rapidly.

To meet this objective, the research projects that are undertaken by our universities must live up to international standards and benchmarks.

Let me also remind you that technology is meaningless unless and until it reaches the common man in the form of benefits and makes his life easier.

I hope that the research being carried out here at SAMEER will open new horizons for the use of electromagnetic technology, both for defence and development so that the fruits of technology can reach the last man in the queue.

I congratulate the scientists of SAMEER and the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology for having established and nurtured such a world-class laboratory for EMI/EMC and EMP.

I see that it is a young institution filled with young and enthusiastic people.

I wish you all a future filled with paradigm-altering discoveries that will earn India the laurel of being a technology leader among the nations of the world.

Jaihind.

Thank You!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that the only matter to be discussed with Pakistan is the handing over the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) to India and asserted that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. 

 

Speaking at the golden Jubilee Celebrations of Naval Science and Technological Laboratory at Visakhapattanam, Andhra Pradesh today, the Vice President said that the government had only made administrative changes with regard to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. “We will not tolerate anybody’s interference in our internal affairs,” he added.  

 

Urging all Indians to speak in one voice on matters of security and national integrity, Shri Naidu said that India was a peace loving country but would give a befitting reply if anybody tried to attack India.  Shri Naidu accused a neigbouring country of aiding, abetting and funding terrorism from across the border. 

 

Shri Naidu lauded NSTL for carrying out Research & Development in core areas related to torpedoes, underwater mines, decoys and stealth and for their research on emerging and futuristic technologies. He said that world class facilities set up by NSTL laboratory for hydrodynamic evaluation of marine platforms would help the nation in achieving self-reliance in marine platform design.

 

Calling for efforts to make India a strong and self-reliant nation, especially in terms of defence technologies the Vice President said that a special focus was needed to develop advanced systems for our armed forces through indigenous technologies. He opined that a nation’s strength lies in the strength of its academic, economic, scientific and technological prowess.

 

The Vice President complimented the outstanding achievements of scientists, especially missile and space technologies and said that it reflects India’s inherent S&T strengths. 

 

‘The success of Geo-Synchronous Launch Vehicles, Agni Series of Missiles, nuclear submarine INS Arihant, fighter aircraft and the Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan missions have propelled us into an elite club of nations possessing ‘niche’ technologies,’ he added.

 

The Vice President urged DRDO, R&D institutes, academia and industry to work hand-in-hand and provide quality products and services. He also wanted them to make good use of programmes such as ‘Make in India’, to design, develop and produce state-of-the-art systems within India. He also asked the private sector to step up investments in R&D in specified areas and produce the sub-systems and systems  

 

The Vice President also went around the exhibition displaying the work carried out by NSTL in the design and development of various weapons and associated systems. He appreciated the contributions of NSTL and DRDO in meeting the requirements of the Indian Navy. He complimented NSTL for the success story of VARUNASTRA, a heavyweight torpedo.

 

On the occasion, the Vice President launched a postal cover on NSTL and laid foundation stone for construction of Sports, Swimming Pool and residential accommodation for married officers. He also inaugurated a technical exhibition displaying the products of DRDO and NSTL developed in collaboration with the Public and Private Sector companies. 

 

The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Youth Advancement, Andhra Pradesh, Shri Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao, Dr G. Satheesh Reddy, Secretary Deparment of Defence R& D and Chairman DRDO, Vice Admiral A K. Jain, AVSM, VSM, Dr. Samir Venkatapati Kamat, Director General, Naval Systems and Minerals DRDO and others were present at the event attended by Sr Scientists, Scientists and researchers of NSTL and DRDO.  

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am delighted to be here with you all at this golden jubilee celebrations of Naval Science & Technological Laboratory, a prestigious institution of the Defence Research and Development Organization. This indeed is a moment to cherish and rejoice for the entire NSTL fraternity. 

Completion of five decades marks an important milestone in the journey of any organization. My heartiest congratulations to the NSTL employees and their families on this momentous occasion!

As you recollect your successes and achievements over the past five decades, you must also reflect and introspect over the shortcomings and chalk out plans that will effectively meet the future challenges.

The success of any institution lies in the success of its working force. I am sure, that under the aegis of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the Scientists, Officers and Staff of NSTL have had great success, both, on  personal as well as professional fronts.

Before I entered this auditorium, I witnessed the excellent work carried out by you in the design and development of various weapons and associated systems. It was heartening to note that a number of systems developed by the Lab have been handed over to the user, Indian Navy. The success story of VARUNASTRA heavyweight torpedo is commendable, and I congratulate Team NSTL for this excellent effort. 

I am also glad to note that world class facilities have been set up by this laboratory for hydrodynamic evaluation of marine platforms, which will help the nation to achieve self-reliance in marine platform design.

With your contributions to R&D in core areas related to torpedoes, underwater mines, decoys and stealth, I am sure that NSTL will leave its mark in research on emerging and futuristic technologies.

Dear Sisters and brothers,

A nation’s strength lies in the strength of its academic, economic, scientific and technological prowess. All of us need to put in our best efforts to make our nation strong and self-reliant.

The Science and Technology landscape has seen great changes with rapid developments in electronics, computer science and information technology. Never in the past has mankind been empowered in such a powerful manner. And never in the past have technologies evolved at such a rapid pace. Therefore, the scientists working in crucial sectors must not only keep abreast of the evolving technologies but must also plan to meet futuristic requirements.

Technologies involving robotics and artificial intelligence, stem cell research, renewable energy generation and storage, augmented reality, space travel, space tourism and space mining, nanotechnology, anti-matter, to name a few, are beginning to play a greater role in our lives. 

Speaking of Defence technology, the nation is focusing hard on the development of advanced systems for our armed forces. Lot of innovative research is being carried out across the country for indigenization of technologies. The outstanding achievements of our nation in missile and space technologies reflect our inherent S&T strengths. The recent success of DRDO’s ASAT mission has made the entire nation proud.

The success of Geo-Synchronous Launch Vehicles, Agni Series of Missiles, nuclear submarine INS Arihant, fighter aircraft and the Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan missions have propelled us into an elite club of nations possessing ‘niche’ technologies. 

Since 1958 Defence R&D has grown to be capable of delivering strategic missile systems, Electronic Warfare, Electronicsl and complex platforms such as the Light Combat Aircraft.

I am happy to note that India is today one of the five nations with ICBM capability, one of the four countries to have a multi-level strategic deterrence capability, one of the five countries to have its own BMD program and underwater missile launch capability, one of the seven countries to have developed its own Main Battle Tank & an indigenous  4th generation Combat aircraft, one of the six countries to have developed a nuclear powered submarine and one of the few countries to have its own Electronic warfare  & multi Range radar program.

Defence R&D led to the development of Bullet proof jackets, breathing systems, farming in high altitude areas, Dengue & Chikungunya control technologies,  multi insect repellent, food poison detection kit which have been put to use. In the field of Nuclear Biological and Chemical technologies, a large number of DRDO systems including Reconnaissance vehicles, dosimeters are in use. Bio-digester for human waste management primarily developed for glaciers has found its potential in the civilian sectors and has become a significant part of Swachch Bharat movement. 

Sisters and brothers,

The Government of India has embarked on a very important programme ‘Make in India’, which encourages design, development and production of state-of-the-art systems within India, thereby encouraging in-house capability, and reducing dependence on external sources. 

This programme would also boost the country’s exports and thereby help the economy grow. Make in India programme requires R&D institutes, academia and industry to work hand-in-hand and provide quality products and services. I am sure that DRDO will contribute its best to this programme.

Focus is to be made on futuristic technologies to become a world leader. From nurturing and working on denied technologies, we need to leapfrog in capability and lead in relevant hi-tech areas. Establishing focused research centres in the specific technologies at R&D centres and academic institutes with state-of-the-art infrastructure is the first step in that direction. 

Innovations by Small and Medium Scale industries should be encouraged and supported. The country needs to have innovative manufacturing institutes with public and private partnership. Also, these technologies must be devised for exports to earn valuable foreign exchange for the country. Bio-sensors, Photonics, NEMS (Nano-electromechanical systems), MEMS (Micro-electromechanical systems), high energy materials, futuristic power supplies, stealth technologies, advanced materials and high power computing are few such priority areas.

To encourage and support research in advanced materials, the Government is formulating a National Material Policy.  This policy provides a blueprint on harnessing the strengths of the knowledge capital in relevant areas of material science and make India one of the 21st century leaders in technology. 

There exists an immediate need to synergize the capabilities of all stakeholders to foster innovation that would result in the overall development of the nation. R&D institutes should focus more on basic and translational research and the public sector units need to play a vital role as lead integrators for development and subsequent production.

The private sector also needs to invest in R&D in specified areas and produce the sub-systems and systems. This will enable such industries to transform their capabilities to the level of lead integrators.  

The new policies of the Government of India are enabling many overseas enterprises to start operations and set up manufacturing units in India with large investments. This is a major driver for development and potential creator of employment. The response to ‘Make in India’ call is overwhelming.

DRDO has a significant role to play in fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. Collaboration and teamwork is important for innovation and creativity. Focus must be laid on setting up incubation, innovation and research centres. Proper mentoring by experts must also be provided. 

Youngsters can be groomed to take up interesting, innovative projects under the Startup India programme. Providing required facilities and guidance will surely help them achieve breakthrough solutions.

Let us all work together to build a strong Bharat. Let us leave a legacy that will make the future generations of this land, proud citizens of New and Inclusive India.

My best wishes to all present here today at the Golden Jubilee of NSTL. May NSTL and DRDO achieve greater success in the years ahead!

Jai Hind!!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for equipping youth with skills and knowledge required to successfully face the 21st-century job market. He stressed that the skilled labour force was vital for the country to make rapid economic progress.

Speaking after inaugurating an exhibition put up by Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) in the campus of the Swarna Bharat Trust, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh today, Shri Naidu observed that it was the time that India reaps the benefits of its demographic dividend by skilling its youth.

Pointing out that there was inherent talent in various sections of the society Shri Naidu said that the youth need to be trained and imparted skills in tune with the fast-changing technological scenario.

With India inching towards becoming the third-largest economy in the coming years, he said that the government and various industry bodies such as CII FICCI, ASOCHAM have to create infrastructure for skilling existing and new entrants to the labor force.

The Vice President also called for measures to reduce the urban-rural divide in terms of ensuring equitable growth and creating opportunities for youth and students to acquire skills. 

Opining that it was important to nurture the talent of the youth to disrupt the status quo and lead to radical innovations, Shri Naidu called for creating an enabling environment for innovation to thrive. He also suggested steps to treat skill development as a National Mission and train the youth, women, and students to support innovation.

The Vice President wanted higher educational institutions to promote skilling and entrepreneurship among the youth. He also wanted the academia and the industry to join hands to make students familiar with the skills required for the 21st-century jobs.

The Vice President went around the exhibition and visited stalls displaying various programs offered by the government of Andhra Pradesh for students to update their skill sets. Students from various Engineering colleges and trainees of Swarna Bharat Trust were made aware of the schemes.

The Governor of Andhra Pradesh Shri Biswa Bhusan Harichandan who participated in the event also accompanied the Vice President during his visit to APSSDC exhibition and later was shown around various training centers at Swarna Bharat Trust.

Shri Challa Madhusudhan Reddy, the Chairman of APSSDC, Shri Kamineni Srinivas, Chairman of Swarna Bharat Trust and other dignitaries were among those present at the event.

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

""I am delighted to be present here and go around the exhibition put up by Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) displaying information about the courses and different programs run by the state for the benefit of students and youth.

I am happy that students from various Engineering Colleges and the trainees of Swarna Bharat trust are getting a good exposure through this fair.

I was informed that Andhra Pradesh Government has formed 7 different Missions to achieve double-digit growth for the state and to make AP among the most developed state in the country. Among these, the Knowledge and Skills Mission has been formed to provide trained and skilled manpower to all other Missions. 

I appreciate the efforts of the government to touch 20 million people in AP in next 15 years and provide them skilling and entrepreneurship to meet skilled human power demands of all Missions and shape AP as the hub for skilled-workforce and knowledge.

As we look forward to make India a global economic superpower and an epicenter of knowledge, we must ensure that we create an enabling environment for innovation to thrive. Innovation must be complemented by creating a skilled manpower by tapping the huge demographic potential in the country.

It is widely acknowledged that India has the advantage of Demographic dividend. The demographic dividend is the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population’s age structure, mainly when the share of the working-age population is larger than the non-working age share of the population.

India is a young, aspirational country. 65% of our population is below 35 years of age. 62% of our population is in the working-age group of 15-59 years. We have a workforce of 48 crores and more than a crore join the workforce every year.

It is the right time that we reap the benefits of our demographic dividend by providing skills. Skills and knowledge are driving forces of economic growth and social development for any country.

As we aim to become a developed country with a $5 trillion economy, it is important to have skilled manpower with the needed skill sets in various sectors to spur growth. It is also important to reduce urban- rural divide in terms of ensuring equitable growth and creating opportunities.

We also need to equip our students with effective communication skills. Mere degrees and diplomas will not make a person employable. For instance, a NASSCOM Survey (2011) found that only 25 percent of the graduates working in the IT sector have the required skills.

Therefore, your degree and diploma need to be supplemented by appropriate skills to take full advantage of the innumerable opportunities in the globalized and liberalized economic environment.

It is important to nurture the talent of our youth to disrupt the status quo and lead to radical innovations. Aligned with our growing economic profile, we have promoted skill development as a National Mission.

Universities should not only be the knowledge hubs but also need to emerge as the hotspots of research, incubation, and innovation. There is a great need to build a strong research ecosystem by collaborative, inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary research initiatives.

Expenditure on Research and Development is a key indicator of private and public sectors effort to foster competitive advantage of Science and Technology. But in India, public expenditure on Research and Development is rather low.

Empowering the youth by skill-building is a powerful tool in current times. It will enhance the efficacy and quality of the work for improved productivity and growth in the future.

I am happy to learn that more than a crore youth are being imparted skill training annually under various programmes of the Government. 56 lakh youth have been trained under flagship Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna, since its inception.

I am happy that government at the Centre and several state governments have been focusing on providing training courses and modules based on Industry requirements. 

Our country is poised for a big transition. Youth are the agents of this transformation. I call upon each one of you to use the available programmes and expanded opportunities.

India is transforming and reinventing itself rapidly, inspired by PM Modi’s call to you “Reform, Perform and Transform”.

I urge each one of you to keep learning and improve your skills. Be lifelong learners.

Universities, higher education institutions must work with corporate firms and other industries to make students familiar with the skills required for the 21st-century technology-dependent job market.

We must build the required infrastructure for skilling existing and new entrants to the labor force. Here I would urge the Industry and Industry bodies such as FICCI, ASOCHAM, and others to play a more pro-active role in creating skilled manpower for various sectors.

I would also call upon every institution providing higher education to have a dedicated department to promote skills and entrepreneurship. Such a department must empower students to seek opportunities in entrepreneurship as well.

Thank you, Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asserted that abrogation of Article 370 is a national issue and not a political one and called upon people to speak in one voice. He cautioned that a neighbouring country could misuse fragmented opinions at international fora. 

 

Speaking at a ‘Meet and Greet’ organized by the Vice President’s friends and well-wishers on the completion of two years in office at Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh today, Shri Naidu said that abrogation of Article 370 was long overdue as it concerned the unity and integrity of the country. 

 

Asserting that Article 370 was only a temporary and transitory provision in the constitution, the Vice President said that its dilution would lead to industrialization of Jammu and Kashmir, create employment and promote tourism.

 

Pointing out that the Bill on reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir was passed by 2/3rds majority in the Rajya Sabha and 4/5ths in the Lok Sabha, the Vice President recalled the debate which took place in 1964 on a private member’s bill when members cutting across the party lines called for its abrogation.

 

The Vice President quoted a news report published by a national daily in 1964 and said that the non official resolution moved by Shri Prakash Vir Shastri in Lok Sabha was supported by several members of Congress including Bhagavat Jha Azad, Sarjoo Pandey (CPI), K Hamunathaiah, H V Kamath ( Socialist) and also members from Jammu & Kashmir state.

 

The Vice President also said that former Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru had pointed to the transitory and temporary nature of the provision in the Constitution during a debate in Parliament in 1963.

 

Observing that India as the largest Parliamentary democracy, should also become an ideal and vibrant Parliamentary democracy, Shri Naidu stressed the need to bring in reforms in legislature, executive and Judiciary for improving efficiency in delivery of public services and to ensure that the fruits of development reach every section of the society. 

 

At the same time, the Vice President called upon all the political parties to evolve a code of conduct for their public representatives at various levels including in Parliament and state Assemblies. He also wanted parties to improve the standards of public discourse and avoid cheap personal tirades and treat each other as rivals and not as enemies.

 

Shri Naidu advocated the constitution of special judicial tribunals for quick and time-bound disposal of criminal cases against politicians, election petitions and political defections. He said cases in all these categories must be disposed within a reasonable time frame of six months to one year. 

 

The Vice President also called for plugging the loopholes in the 10th Schedule of the Constitution that deals with defections. He stressed the need for the presiding officers to take action on defection cases in a stipulated time of three months.

 

Shri Naidu also advocated setting up of Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court Benches in various parts of the country for speedy disposal of various cases.

 

Backing the call given by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to end usage of single use plastic by October 2nd this year, the Vice President said that other programs such as Swachh Bharat, Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao and Per Drop - More Crop should be converted into mass national movements with the active participation of people.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon the citizens to do away with single-use plastics and clean local communities of littered plastics.

Speaking at the 150th Birth Anniversary of Shri Dharmamurthi Rao Bahadur Calavala Cunnan Chetty at the Centenary Auditorium, University of Madras in Chennai today, he referred to the call given by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to end single-use plastics and said “I think it is a very welcome appeal”.

Urging the citizens to support it, he said “It will be our humble tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. It will be in consonance with the ideals espoused by Shri Calavala Cunnan Chetti Garu,” he added. 

Paying glowing tributes to Dharmamurthi Rao Bahadur Calavala Cunnan Chetty for the philanthropic work undertaken by him during the pre-Independence time, Shri Naidu complimented the Trustees for earnestly carrying forward his legacy and noble vision for the welfare of the society.

The Vice President said that Shri Calavala Cunnan Chetty singularly took up the mission of social upliftment of society when the country was under colonial rule and there were hardly any social welfare schemes run by the Government.

He opined that it was necessary to recognize the contribution of wealth creators and wealth distributors like Chetty guru who not only provide revenue to the Government and create jobs, but also contribute to social good.

The Vice President said that all business enterprises have a social context and referred to earmarking of 2 per cent of their profitis for CSR activities by bigger companies.

Lauding the commendable support given by certain corporate bodies to the Swachch Bharat mission and for promotion of socially relevant programmes, Shri Naidu said that much more needs to be done. The CSR projects must be result oriented and community-driven so that it becomes a sustainable movement. 

Pointing out that world over the phenomenon of socially relevant business was growing, he said global corporations have set up Foundations to carry forward philanthropic work. 

Stressing the need to imbibe the values of charity, empathy, compassion, and voluntarism in students from an early age, he said that schools and educational institutions must empower students to grow into ideal citizens of the society who would be responsive and responsible towards larger community. 

Observing that schools must become resource centers for the local community, Shri Naidu said that they should do voluntary community work and must focus on issues like social and gender justice, family health, cleanliness, child labour, environmental protection and preservation of natural resources.

Opining that language was the medium of expression of our thoughts and emotions and that the literature in each language was rich and varied, Shri Naidu wanted people to learn as many languages as possible without neglecting their own mother tongue.

“Our languages can bring us together. They will help us increase our own knowledge and lead to wider appreciation of diverse ideas,” he added.

Observing that it was essential to make the medium of instruction, at least upto Class 5 in the local language or mother tongue to make education inclusive and universal, Shri Naidu said that such a step would help young minds to grasp concepts easily.

He called for steps to encourage the use of Indian languages in education by providing quality books and recruiting Indian language teachers wherever feasible.

He also released a postal stamp to commemorate the centenary year.

The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit, the Minister for Fisheries and Personnel & Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri Jayakumar, the Chief Postmaster General, Shri M. Sampath, the President of Darmamurthi Rao Bahadur Calavala Cunnan Chetty Charities, Shri M. Venkatesaperumal and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It is an honour to associate with this momentous occasion and preside over the 150th Birth Anniversary Celebrations of the celebrated philanthropist, Dharmamurthi Rao Bahadur Calavala Cunnan Chetty Garu. This  milestone of the Centenary of the Charity, also coincides with the Golden Jubilee of the aided institutions Dharmamurthi Rao Bahadur Calavala Cunnan Chetty’s Hindu College and the Seetha Kingston House Matriculation Higher Secondary School.

Dharmamurthi Rao Bahadur Calavala Cunnan Chetty Garu lived by the celebrated dictum of Thiruvalluvar “Puththezh ulagaththum indum Peralaride, Oppuravin nalla pira” – Nothing is better than the joy of benevolence and charity either in this world or Heaven.”

I congratulate the Trustees who have earnestly and conscientiously been carrying forward his legacy, his noble vision for the welfare of the society. I also extend my appreciation to each and every one who is associated with their efforts to realize the founder’s noble vision. 

Sri Cunnan Chetty Garu set an inspiring example for the future generations of entrepreneurs and business leaders. He lived by the Indian tradition of “Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah, Sarve Santu Niramaya, Sarve Bhadrani Pashanyu, Ma Kashchid Dukh-bhagbhavet” encapsulating the Indian ethical philosophy of  ‘Share and Care’ which prays for welfare and well being of all. 

Impressed with his commitment towards society, his contemporary, the great poet Subramanya Bharathi  praised Sri Chetty Garu for establishing  “Dharma” and spirit of equality among religions in his educational institutions.   His another illustrious contemporary Dr Annie Besant, posthumously conferred the title of ’Dharmamurthi’ on him. 

Dear Sisters and brothers,

Shri Chetty was a multi-faceted person. A firm believer and ardent supporter of indigenous medicine, he established an Ayurvedic hospital besides arranging for free distribution of milk to needy children, monthly financial assistance to widows and destitutes, nutritious food every-day for hundreds of hungry students, educational scholarships and medical aid to deserving patients. He generously supported restoration of temples and places of worship. Most importantly, he established educational institutions to  provide quality education to thousands of aspiring students.

Sri Cunnan Chetty Garu’s vision was to transform the lives of innumerable youth, empowering them and enlightening them with knowledge and education. In our tradition, it is said about knowledge “Daane naiv kshayam yaati vidya ratnam maha-danam” i.e.  Knowledge is the supreme wealth which is not reduced even if you gift it. Knowledge only expands with sharing. 

Shri Cunnan Chetti Garu proved that by establishing charity educational schools, he only multiplied the wealth of knowledge. 

Our society has had many philanthropists but certainly, we need more Charities and Trusts to come forward and establish institutions delivering social services like education and health. 

The Government is currently in the process of finalizing the New Education Policy. Its vision is to provide “an India-centred education system that contributes directly to transforming our nation into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society, by providing high quality education to all…” 

The draft Policy encourages philanthropic institutions in the field of school education. It says “Private philanthropic schools must be encouraged and freed of regulatory overload”. It is a commendable objective that must be pursued by all the stakeholders in education with all earnestness.  

To make education really inclusive and universal, it is proposed in the draft policy that the medium of instruction, at least upto Class 5, would be local language or mother tongue. This will help young minds to grasp concepts easily and help them to express themselves. The draft policy proposes to encourage use of Indian Languages in education, by providing quality books in Indian languages and by recruiting Indian language teachers wherever feasible. 

 Language is the medium of expression of our thoughts and emotions. Every Indian language is venerable. The literature in each language is rich and varied. We should learn as many languages as possible without neglecting our own mother tongue. Our languages can bring us together. They will help us increase our own knowledge and wider appreciation of diverse ideas. 

I am glad that the students who study in these educational institutions imbibe the values of charity, empathy, compassion and voluntarism. I am sure that they will grow into ideal citizens of the society who will be responsive and responsible towards larger community.  Schools should be resource centers for the local community. They should do voluntary community work and provide solutions to issues like social and gender justice, family health and cleanliness, child labour and environment protection or preservation of natural resources like water and soil etc.

Recently, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address, has given a call to clean our surroundings and do away with the use of single use plastic. I think it is a very welcome appeal. As citizens, we must support it and clean our local communities of littered plastics.  It will be our humble tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. It will be in consonance with the ideals espoused by Shri Calavala Cunnan Chetti Garu.        

Today, Dharmamurthi Rao Bahadur Calavala Cunnan Chetty’s Charities completes a hundred years. I am pleased to learn that the Trustees have religiously followed Sri Cunnan Chetty Garu’s lofty ideals, nurturing his vision and spearheading his many magnanimous initiatives. As Adi Shankara in his Prashnottara Ratnamalika explains “Ka Preyasi Vidheya? Karuna Deeneshu Sajjane maîtri” – What should be our favourite endeavour? Compassion for poor and friendship of good people”.  This Charity has its origins in this approach.   

Sisters and brothers, 

In every tradition, charity is the most exalted of social virtues. In Bhagwat Gita it is said that “ Giving Charity without expectation, at right place and time and to deserving person, is known as Satvik Dana.” Let me once again refer to the eternal wisdom of Thirukkural. It says : Thalarrith Thanda Porulellam Thakkarkku, Velanmai Seydar Poruttu”- i.e. All wealth earned by hard work and honesty is meant for meeting the needs of deserving.   

Friends, 

As we gather on this occasion to honour the legacy of Chetty garu’s social service, we must also realize when Shri Calavala Cunnan Chetty Garu almost singularly took up the mission of social upliftment of society, our country was under colonial rule and there were hardly any social welfare schemes run by the Government. It was a society that was constricted by its own superstitions and obscurantist beliefs. It is indeed commendable that in such difficult times, he created a chain of charitable institutions. 

It is necessary that we recognize the contribution of wealth creators and wealth distributors like Chetty garu. They not only provide revenue to the Government and jobs to our educated youth, but they also contribute to social good. 

Dear Sisters and brothers, 

Mahatma Gandhi recognized the role of the philanthropists in nation building. He saw them as Trustees of public good. He asked them to shun the ownership of their wealth and instead, hold it in public trust for the welfare of country and community. Their wealth was not meant for the leisure of their family alone. It was for the welfare of larger family of mankind- an ideal inspired by our age old vision of Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam. Adi Shankra defines the Ultimate Truth   as “Bhootam hitam”- “Welfare of all the living beings”.  Sri Cunnan Chetty Garu actually realized this Ultimate Truth and dedicated his entire life to charitable activities intended to provide welfare to and promote well being of fellow human beings. 

We must realize that all business enterprises essentially have a social context. Bigger companies are now earmarking 2% of their profit for projects under Corporate Social Responsibility. I recognize the commendable support given by certain Corporate bodies to the Swachch Bharat mission. I am glad that many Corporate bodies are also making significant contribution to promotion of socially relevant programmes. However, much more needs to be done. The CSR projects must be result oriented and community-driven so that it becomes a sustainable movement. 

We all know that world over, the phenomenon of socially relevant business is growing. Global corporations have set up Foundations to carry forward philanthropic work. 

Recently I visited an educational institution at Indore which is run by an old Trust formed by the local association of cloth merchants and traders of Indore. Even small businesses at local level can come together to take up philanthropic work for local community.  One can do charity projects associated with one’s own trade, they can train young students in the trade, this will give a huge boost to skilling our young students. 

Sisters and brothers, 

I am extremely happy to be a part of this function today morning.  It gives me the optimism that the spirit of philanthropy will continue to grow and we will have more individuals and institutions like Shri Chetty garu in the coming years.  

I compliment the Trustees of the charities for their devotion and dedication, to many of the illustrious old students who continue to be associated with the school and countless well wishers who are continuing Chetty garu’s noble mission. 

I am happy that the Postal department has brought out a postal stamp to commemorate the centenary year. 

I wish the Trust all the very best in its future activities. 

Jai Hind !""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has condoled the passing away of the former Union Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley. In a message, he said that Shri Jaitley was an outstanding Parliamentarian, legal luminary, towering intellectual, an able administrator and a man of impeccable integrity. Shri Jaitley strove hard and burnt the midnight oil to bring about a consensus across the political spectrum in ushering the revolutionary GST regime in the country, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s message:

“I am deeply shocked to learn about the demise of Shri Arun Jaitley, a long time dear friend and one of my closest associates. His death is an irreparable loss to the nation and a personal loss to me. I have no words to express my grief. 

Outstanding Parliamentarian, legal luminary, towering intellectual, an able administrator and a man of impeccable integrity, Shri Jaitley distinguished himself by effectively handling important portfolios as Union Minister in the cabinets of Shri A.B. Vajpayee and Shri Narendra Modi .

He was also a recipient of the Best Parliamentarian Award.

Shri Jaitley strove hard and burnt the midnight oil to bring about a consensus across the political spectrum in ushering the revolutionary GST regime in the country. He made immense contribution to public discourse on various issues from time to time.

He was also a communicator par excellence and used to articulate the most complex issues in a simple manner.”

                The Vice President today decried attempts to spread misinformation and internationalize the re-structuring of the Jammu & Kashmir state which was purely an administrative matter and within the purview of the Indian government. 

Addressing the heads of Estonian diplomatic missions on the last day of his tri-nation tour to the Baltic Region,Shri. Naidu said that India would not accept interference or mediation in the internal affairs of the country and asserted that the restructuring of Jammu Kashmir state was aimed at improving governance and fostering inclusive and equitable growth. “This decision was taken by the Indian parliament with an overwhelming majority cutting across party lines”, he added.

The Vice Presidents said that attempts by our neighbouring country to spread misinformation was totally unwarranted and that this kind of meddling with other nation’s internal administration doesn’t bode well for world peace. “Misinformation, disinformation and malicious, hateful rhetoric exacerbate tensions.  In a world that has committed to achieve an ambitious, transformative agenda of sustainable development by 2030, these irritants can retard the progress substantially”, he added. 

The Vice President also outlined a few perspectives that have been guiding India’s engagement with the world, Samvad, Samruddhi,Suraksha, Sanskriti, and Samman  (Dialogue, mutual prosperity, mutual security, strengthening cultural ties and mutual respect). “We believe that we must have an inclusive, open and free system that treats all nations equally and fairly and aims to create mutually- beneficial platforms for cooperation. We wish to see a world order that ensures security and growth for all”, he said.

Pointing out that India has been facing the menace of cross-border terrorism for long, Shri. Naidu told the Estonian leaders that more needs to be done by the international community to counter activities of terrorist groups and individuals. 

He stressed that there was a need to bring greater accountability and transparency to the work of UN Security Council’s Sanctions Committee dealing with listing of terrorists. 

The Vice President urged all members of the UN to demonstrate a collective political will for early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism which was proposed by India in 1996.

Naidu said that we recognized the importance of building a global order based on respect for international law and national sovereignty.

Appreciating Estonia’s e-residency scheme, which facilitated about 2200 Indians to become e-residents of Estonia, he said it would enable Indian companies and entrepreneurs to use Estonia as a launch pad for entering the Baltic, Nordic and European markets.

                The Vice President today made it clear that the recent measures taken by the Indian Government in regard to the status of Jammu and Kashmir are purely internal administrative matters. “India would not allow any outside interference in its internal affairs”, he said. 

 

On the fourth day of his tri-nation tour to Baltic nations on Tuesday (August 20, 2019), the Vice President held wide ranging discussions with the President and Prime Minister of the Republic of Latvia, Mr. Egils Levits and Mr. Krišjānis Kariņš respectively in Riga, the capital of Latvia.

During the talks with the Acting Speaker, the two leaders discussed the need to increase parliamentary exchanges between the two nations and a proposal to establish a joint parliamentary friendship group.

The Vice President also unveiled the bust of the Father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi at the National Library of Latvia. Shri. Naidu expressed hope that the bust of Mahatma Gandhi would be an inspiration to the visitors of the National Library in Riga and said that Gandhi ji’s message of non-violence and peaceful co-existence was universal, eternal and highly relevant for today’s conflict prone world. 

 

He also presented 51 books to the national library called ‘Bharat ek Parichay’ which reflect the heritage and traditions of India. 

Earlier the Vice President and the President of Latvia witnessed the signing of an MoU on cultural exchange for 2019-21.

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called upon the Indian community in Lithuania to serve as a bridge in strengthening economic and cultural relations between the two countries. 

Addressing the Indian community at Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania on the second day of his three nation tour to the Baltic region, he said the bilateral trade between the countries was below potential and added that Lithuania could be an important technology partner for India, especially in areas such as lasers, renewable energy, agro-food processing and life sciences.

Observing that India has become one of the fastest growing large economies in the world, he said the business sentiment following the numerous initiatives implemented by the Government of India was positive and upbeat. “The New India’s mantra is “Reform, Perform and Transform”, he added.

Shri Naidu also stressed that India was one of the most open economies of the world and is placed now at 77th rank among 190 countries in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index.

The Vice President said that the “Make in India” campaign was establishing India as the hub of manufacturing and investment. He said that “Smart Cities”, “Digital India” and “Skill India” Missions were not only transforming our nation but also providing immense opportunities to collaborate and work together. “Our youth are driving the digital revolution, powering the start-up ecosystem and pioneering artificial intelligence. The Start-up India flagship initiative is intended to build a strong Eco-system for nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship in the country”, he added.

Shri. Naidu said that India was making rapid strides in the development journey and has an ambitious plan to build next-generation infrastructure including 100 Smart Cities, 10 green-field airports, 7 high-speed train corridors, 5 major ports, highways and nation-wide broadband connectivity linking our villages and urban areas.

The Vice President praised the Indian diaspora for acting as a bridge to integrate the cultures of India and Lithuania. He told them to be conscious of the rich culture of their motherland and strive to spread India's message of peace and goodwill, symbolized by the universal and timeless philosophy of Vasudaiva Kutumbam. 

Appreciating the keen interest showed by Lithuania in Indian culture, philosophy, arts and spirituality, the Vice President described the members of the diaspora as India’s cultural ambassadors. 

Mentioning the technological progress made by India, Shri. Naidu referred to the successful launch of ‘Chadrayaan 2’, India’s second mission to moon, which had been fully fabricated in India, last month. ‘The mission is really a glowing testimony to the rapid advances the country has been making in Science and Technology in the last few years’, he added.

Applauding the Vilnius University for being at the forefront in promoting Indology studies, including Hindi, the Vice President said that interest in Indian philosophy, films and cuisine had risen phenomenally. 

Shri. Naidu expressed his happiness that Lithuanian Universities had become a destination of choice for Indian students whose numbers increased significantly in recent years. He appealed to the young Indian students to be sensitive to local culture and sensitivities.

Referring to the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Vice President said that Lithuania held a special place of importance because Gandhi ji’s closest friend and soul mate, Hermann Kallenbach was from Lithuania. 

He thanked the Government of Lithuania for commemorating their friendship by installing a sculpture of Gandhi and Kallenbach in Rusne. 

Earlier, the Vice President visited the city of Kaunas and met with the Mayor, Mr. Visvaldas Matijosaitis, who hosted a lunch to Shri Naidu and the Indian delegation. The Mayor also presented the ‘Key to the City’ and ‘The Coat of Arms of Lithuania’, also known as Vytis, to the Vice President.   

The Vice President also invited the Mayor to visit India with business delegation to explore business opportunities between our two countries.

The Vice President also visited the laboratory area of the Institute of Material Sciences and the Ultra Sound Research Institute at the Santaka Valley of the Kaunas University of Technology in Kaunas. He also witnessed a presentation on the Krunois Hydro Power Plant at the University. 

The former President of the Republic of Lithuania, Mr.Vytautas Landsbergis called on the Vice President and discussed the bilateral ties between the two countries.

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu, who began a three-nation tour to the Baltic region today, briefed the Lithuanian President, Gitanas Nauseda on the recent decision of the Indian Government to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution that conferred Special Status upon Jammu and Kashmir. He said that was taken to ensure all-round development and extend  benefits to the people of the newly-created Union Territories. 

During a tête-à-têtewith Mr. Nauseda in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania on the first leg of his tour, the Vice President asserted that the re-organization of Jammu &Kashmir was aimed at reducing regional disparity and improving administrative efficiency.

He also informed the Lithuanian President that more than 100 progressive legislations have now become applicable to the two Union Territories. They include reservation of seats for women in Panchayats (Local Self Governments), implementing child protection programs, ensuring right to education for children and protecting women from domestic violence.

He informed the Lithuanian President that Article 370 had enabled vested interests to create a climate of separatism and establish linkages with terrorist groups. This atmosphere encouraged the practice of cross-border terrorism. He also told him that although large resources were given to the state by the Union Government, there was no commensurate development.

Shri Naidu explained that the reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir was completely within the purview of the Government of India. “We expect understanding from our international partners that this decision concerns our national progress and prosperity. It has equity and inclusion as the main objective”.

Observing that terrorism was one of the major challenges confronting the world today, he urged all the nations to intensify their collective efforts and strive to eliminate the menace of terrorism and also isolate nations which aid and abet terrorism.

The Vice President thanked the Government of Lithuania for extending its support and solidarity in condemning the Pulwama terrorist attack.

Both the dignitaries had extensive discussions on important aspects of bilateral relationship as well as global and regional issues of common interest. They renewed their commitment to further build on the long-standing friendly ties between the two countries.

They also agreed on the need for the UN to demonstrate a collective political will for early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, which was proposed by India many years ago.

They discussed the need for an early and comprehensive reform of the United Nation’s Security Council to make it more representative to reflect the realities of today and address current global challenges. They agreed to strengthen the existing cooperation between the two countries at the United Nations and other multilateral fora.

Both the dignitaries also discussed the huge scope for expansion of commercial and economic ties. Shri Naidu said that India was now among the fastest growing major economies in the world and wanted Lithuanian businesses to take advantage of the opportunities available in India. He praised Lithuania’s many achievements since achieving independence almost 30 years back. 

Expressing his happiness over the warm welcome and hospitality accorded to him and the Indian delegation by the people of Lithuania, Shri Naidu said that both the countries have civilizational links that go back centuries. “Lithuanian is the oldest Indo-European language and it has strong links with Sanskrit”, he added.

The Vice President was presented a copy of the ‘History of Lithuania’ in Hindi. He expressed his appreciation for the publication- Comparative Dictionary of 108 Common Lithuanian and Sanskrit words. He said ‘We may now endeavour to compile and publish the comprehensive dictionary of 10,000 common words in our languages’.

The Lithuanian President and the Vice President witnessed the signing of two agreements on Agriculture and Allied sectors and Cultural Exchange Program from 2019-21.

The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu paid glowing tributes to former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his first death anniversary today.

Unveiling the portrait of the former Prime Minister at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre in Kolkata today, the Vice President said that Vajpayee Ji taught everybody to serve the country selflessly and to remain steadfastly committed to the principles of humanism and tolerance.

Describing Shri Vajpayee as a statesman and a visionary, the Vice President said that he was not only one of the tallest leaders of the country but was also one of the most loved leaders.

“It is a solemn day today. His humble life, love of country and its people and ability to dream big for the country is an inspiration to all,” he said.

The Vice President spoke extensively of his long association of the Shri Vajpayee and said that he had the opportunity to work with him in the party and later as a minister in his cabinet to give shape to rural connectivity revolution by way of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.

Observing that Atal Ji demonstrated how democracy can be strengthened through good governance, the Vice President said that the former Prime Minister ushered in a ‘connectivity’ revolution in the country.

“He gave an unprecedented fillip to the building of national highways, rural roads, air travel infrastructure and massive expansion of the telecom sector. For him, connectivity was the key enabler of economic development and national growth,” he added.

Talking about Shri Vajpayee’s active role in shaping India’s post-Independence domestic and foreign policy, the Vice President said that the former Prime Minister strongly believed in a forward-looking, forward moving India, a strong and prosperous nation confident of its rightful place on the international fora. 

He said Vajpayee Ji firmly believed that India has a legitimate right to becoming a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.

Shri Naidu said that Atal Ji had an uncanny ability to connect with people from all walks of life and with political parties of different ideological moorings. “Atal Ji had virtually no enemies and was rightly called as Ajatshatru,” he added.

The Governor of West Bengal, Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar, The Minister for Science & Technology and Biotechnology and Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, Shri Bratya Basu, Member of Parliament & President of Indian Council for Cultural Relations, Dr. Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and the Director-General, Indian Council for Cultural Relations, Shri Akhilesh Mishra were present.

The following is the full text of the speech: 

 

Today we are gathered to pay tribute to our beloved former Prime Minister late, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji on his first death anniversary.

He was not only one of the tallest leaders of the country but also one of the most loved leaders. We lost a great leader and visionary in Vajpayee ji on this day last year. It is a solemn day today. His humble life, love of country and its people and ability to dream big for the country is an inspiration to all.

He was a great administrator, highly popular politician, orator par excellence, an outstanding Parliamentarian and a great role model to all.

Known for his liberal worldview and commitment to democratic ideals, a multifaceted personality, respected by all, Vajpayee ji was a man of the masses and a guiding light for the political class. During one of his speeches in the Rajya Sabha, former Prime Minister Shri Manmohan Singh referred to Vajpayee ji as the Bhishma Pitamah of Indian politics. Such was the stature of Vajpayee ji that commanded respect from all.

Atal ji had an uncanny ability to connect with people from all walks of life and with political parties of different ideological moorings. Atal Ji had virtually no enemies and was rightly called as Ajatshatru.

Of the leaders who stood steadfast as a bridge between the times when the country was struggling for freedom and when it was a free country striving to be an emerging power, Vajpayee ji was one of the strong pillars of that stable bridge reminding us always:

जोपायाउसमेंखोनजाएं,
जोखोयाउसकाध्यानकरें॥ 

A veteran Parliamentarian, Vajpayee ji’s career and contributions stretched over five decades. He was elected to the Lok Sabha 10 times and to the Rajya Sabha twice, which is a record by itself. In 1994, he was conferred with India’s ‘Best Parliamentarian’ award, the citation of which summarized Vajpayee ji’s life and persona so succinctly. It read : “True to his name, Atalji is an eminent national leader, an erudite politician, a selfless social worker, forceful orator, poet and litterateur, journalist and indeed a multi-faceted personality…Atalji articulates the aspirations of the masses… his works ever echo total commitment to nationalism.”

A statesman and a visionary, Vajpayee ji led the country to new heights as India’s Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairperson of various important Standing Committees of Parliament and Leader of the Opposition.

He was very active in shaping India’s post-Independence domestic and foreign policy. He believed in a forward-looking, forward moving India, a strong and prosperous nation confident of its rightful place on the international fora. He firmly believed that, “India has a legitimate right to becoming a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.” During his second term as Prime Minister , the 1998 Pokhran-II Nuclear tests and the victory in 1999 Kargil war changed India’s image internationally as that of an assertive country.

Yet, he was conscious when he said, “We are unnecessarily wasting our precious resources in wars... if we must wage war, we have to do it on unemployment, disease, poverty, and backwardness.” His understanding of the social issues that gripped the country was deep. He would say, “Poverty is multidimensional. It extends beyond money incomes to education, health care, political participation and advancement of one's own culture and social organization...’’. He always worked towards addressing these issues.

An ardent champion of women’s empowerment and social equality, Vajpayee ji’s government introduced several economic and infrastructural reforms which included encouraging private sector and foreign investments, reducing wasteful governmental expenditure, promoting research and development.

Atal ji demonstrated how democracy can be strengthened through good governance.

The former Prime Minister ushered in a ‘connectivity’ revolution in the country. He gave an unprecedented fillip to building of national highways, rural roads, air travel infrastructure and massive expansion of the telecom sector. For him, connectivity was the key enabler of economic development and national growth.

The National Highways Development Project connecting the states and major cities; Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana connecting every village and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aimed at improving education at primary and secondary levels in the country are some of the well-known projects initiated by Vajpayee ji which transformed the country. Today, these are the success stories. In 2014, Vajpayee ji’s Birthday – 25th December – was declared “the Good Governance Day”. He was conferred Padma Vibhushan in 1992 and India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna by the President of India in 2015 in recognition of his selfless dedication to the country and service to society and the nation.

Tribute paid to Vajpayee ji will be incomplete if I fail to mention about his passion for writing. Vajpayee ji was as much a prolific writer as he was an impactful orator. His personality is revealed in totality in his works, both in prose and poetry. He would say, “My poet's heart gives me strength to face political problems, particularly those which have a bearing on my conscience.” His writings were honest and sensitive, fearless and powerful.

Even though he is no more with us today, his life and works, his ideals and memories will always be with us.Vajpayee ji will continue to live in our hearts. Vajpayee Ji taught us all to serve the country selflessly and to remain steadfastly committed to the principles of humanism and tolerance. I would like to end my tribute to Vajpayee ji by quoting a few lines from his poem:

बाधाएंआतीहैंआए,
घिरेंप्रलयकीघोरघटाएं,
पावोंकेनीचेअंगारे,
सिरपरबरसेंयदिज्वालाएं,
निज हाथोंमेंहंसते-हंसते,
आगलगाकरजलनाहोगा।
कदममिलाकरचलनाहोगा। 

Jai Hind

                The Vice President of India, Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu has called on the government and the civil society organizations to get together and take up the task of preserving our tangible and intangible cultural heritage.

He emphasized that both the government and civil society groups must also work to generate awareness among the larger public about the need to preserve the architectural marvels of India. ‘General public must desist from defacing and misusing these precious buildings and must make every effort to prevent the further degeneration of these jewels’, he said.

Shri. Naidu was addressing the gathering after inaugurating and dedicating to the nation ‘Shyamoli’, the heritage house of Rabindranath Tagore.

Shyamoli is an experimental mud-house built at Santiniketan in 1935. The house has been recently renovated by the Archaeological Survey of India as a deposit work and is a property of Visva-Bharati at present.

The Vice President said that to Bengal, Tagore has been, and still remains to this day, an altogether exceptional literary figure, towering over all others.

‘For India, especially for Bengal, he is a great institution and for the world, he was the voice, the representative of India’s spiritual heritage. He is indeed India’s pride and glory’, he added.

Shri Naidu said that Santiniketan embodied Rabindranath Tagore’s vision of a place of learning that is unencumbered by religious and regional barriers. He added that Santiniketan was affectionately moulded by Tagore on the principles of humanism, internationalism and a sustainable development.

The Vice President also applauded Tagore’s effort to expand the school’s relationship with the neighbouring villages of the Santhal tribal community in an attempt to help with rural reconstruction and to sensitize the students about the challenges of rural life.

Quoting Mahatma Gandhi who said that “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any”, Shri Naidu said that Santiniketan had successfully adapted to the changing times yet managed to preserve its essence.

The Vice President said that India was home to a treasure trove of cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible. ‘Our heritage is our identity; it is what makes us unique and exceptional. India always held an enviable position in the world because of its rich and extremely diverse cultural heritage’ he added.

Shri. Naidu cautioned that we simply could not let our architectural gems lie buried under the weight of neglect and inertia. Citing that Tagore was an ardent believer in the value of protecting, nurturing and propagating our rich cultural heritage, Shri. Naidu said that it is our duty and responsibility to protect every single monument and every single art form and pass it on to posterity so that they grow up in complete comprehension of India’s glorious history.

Speaking of India’s rich vernacular architecture, the Vice president said that these architectural marvels would serve as models of sustainable housing to be emulated, for future architects and builders and therefore must be zealously restored where necessary and preserved. He applauded the Archaeological Survey of India for the great restoration work of Shyamali carried out by them.

He opined that the dedication of this heritage house to the nation and making its rich history available to everyone is the best tribute that can be paid to India’s immortal bard who always believed in the democratization of knowledge and wisdom. He expressed hope that ‘Shyamali’ would prove to be an abode for students and other knowledge seekers alike.

The Governor of West Bengal, Shri Jagdeep Dhankar, the Minister for Fisheries Department, West Bengal, Shri Bratya Basu, the Vice Chancellor, Vishwa Bharati, Prof. Bidyut Chakrabarty and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am very happy to be with all of you today to inaugurate and dedicate to the nation Shyamali, the heritage house of Shri. Rabindranath Tagore. 

Shyamali is an experimental mud-house built at Santiniketan in 1935. I am glad to know that the house has been recently renovated by the Archaeological Survey of India as a deposit work. I am told that the historical house is a property of Visva-Bharati at present.

Rabindranath Tagore visited Santiniketan for the first time at the age of twelve and stayed at the house built by his father Maharshi Devendranath Tagore known as Santiniketan Griha. Santiniketan gets its name from this house which stands even today as an example of the splendor of colonial architecture. 

Rabindranath, out of a traumatic and claustrophobic childhood-experience of his own education at school within the boundaries of four walls, set up a school for children at Santiniketan in 1901. He then built 5 new houses at the Northern corner of the Santiniketan ashram which is now know Uttarayana and named them  Konark, Udayan, Shyamali, Punascha and Udichi. 

History says that Shri. Rabindranath Tagore stayed in these houses at various points of time and took special interest in the planning of the houses according to his requirements. 

I am told that Shri. Rabindranath Tagore, was dissatisfied with concrete structures and desired to have a new house made of mud as his last abode and as a result, Shyamali was built and that the roof of Shyamali is also made of mud. 

He hoped that Shyamali would encourage poverty-stricken families of rural Bengal to have earthen roofs instead of thatched roofs prone to be destroyed in fire. Large and empty earthen vessels were intentionally placed inside the thick mud walls and roof of one of the rooms of Shyamali for the purpose of introducing a natural cooling system. 

Rabindranath immortalised this house by publishing a book of Poems entitled ‘Shyamali’ in 1936. 

I am happy to learn that the house was designed by Surendranath Kar, built by Santal artisans under the supervision of Gour Mondal and subsequently decorated by Nandalal Bose and Ramkinkar Baiz in association with the students of Kala-Bhavana of Visva-Bharati.

It is a matter of great pride that Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi stayed at this house in 1940 during their visit to Santiniketan and also preferred to stay at this house after the death of the Poet. 

My dear sisters and brothers,

Shri. Rabindranath Tagore was the first Asian to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913. He was a native of Calcutta, who wrote in Bengali and often translated his own work into English. 

He wrote poetry, fiction, drama, essays, and songs; promoted reforms in education, aesthetics and religion; and in his late 60s he even turned to the visual arts, producing nearly 2,500 paintings and drawings before his death.

To Bengal, Tagore has been, and remains, an altogether exceptional literary figure, towering over all others.

Tagore’s poetry, which often takes the form of melodious songs, called Rabindrasangeet, has transformed popular Bengali music with its particular combination of reflective language and compatible tunes.

With his translations of some of his poems he became rapidly known in the West. His fame attained a luminous height, taking him across continents on lecture tours and tours of friendship. 

For India, especially for Bengal, he is a great living institution and for the world, he became the voice, the representative of India’s spiritual heritage. 

He is indeed India’s pride and glory.

Santiniketan embodies Rabindranath Tagore’s vision of a place of learning that is unencumbered by religious and regional barriers. Santiniketan was established in 1863 with the aim of helping education go beyond the confines of the classroom.

By 1921, Santiniketan slowly grew into one of the most revered Universities of India, the Visva Bharati University. It remains the abode to some of the most creative minds in the country. 

Santiniketan was affectionately moulded by Tagore on the principles of humanism, internationalism and a sustainable environment.

He developed a unique curriculum that was an optimum blend of art, human values and cultural interchange. Even today, one can still feel his presence, his passion, his dedication and his pride in the institution in the portals of Santiniketan.

The poet who sincerely believed that “The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence”, envisioned the creation of a thriving centre of education where nature walks and excursions were a part of the curriculum and special attention was paid to natural phenomena. 

Tagore also sought to expand the school’s relationship with the neighbouring villages of the Santhal tribal community in an attempt to help with rural reconstruction and to sensitize the students about the challenges of rural life. I am glad to note that, thanks to his efforts, Santiniketan has today become the largest centre for educated Santhals in West-Bengal. 

As our Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi said “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any”, Over the years, Santiniketan has adapted to the changing times yet preserved its essence in the way what Tagore wanted it to be. 

My dear sisters and brothers,

Tagore was an ardent believer in the value of protecting, nurturing and propagating our rich cultural heritage. He once said “Without music and the fine arts, a nation lacks its highest means of national self-expression and the people remain inarticulate.”

India is home to a treasure trove of cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible. Our heritage is our identity; it is what makes us unique and exceptional. India always held an enviable position in the world because of its rich and extremely diverse cultural heritage.

It is our duty and responsibility to protect every single monument and every single art form and pass it on to posterity so that they grow up in complete comprehension of India’s glorious history. Our cultural heritage is our collective legacy. We have to preserve it so that the generations to come may enjoy the educational, cultural and aesthetic benefits of our great cultural heritage.

Since time immemorial, India has been known for its architectural genius, especially vernacular architecture. Indian vernacular architecture includes informal, functional structures, often in rural areas of India, built of local materials and designed to meet the needs of the local people. 

The builders of these structures were often unschooled in formal architectural design and their work reflects the rich diversity of India's climate. They were built using locally available building materials and symbolized the intricate variations in local social customs and craftsmanship. 

Indian vernacular architecture is an epitome of sustainability.  These structures serve as models of sustainable housing to be emulated, for future architects and builders and therefore must be zealously restored where necessary and preserved. 

I understand quite well the arduous nature of restoration work. 

It is not an easy project. 

But we simply cannot let our architectural gems lie buried under the weight of neglect and inertia. As the famous Sanskrit dramatist Bhasa had said, “it is much more difficult to preserve treasure than to acquire it.”

I applaud ASI for the great restoration work of Shyamali carried out by them. 

The government and the civil society organizations must get together and take up the task of preservation of our tangible and intangible cultural heritage. 

Both the government and civil society groups must also work to generate awareness among the larger public about the value of these buildings and for the duty of preserving these architectural marvels also falls on each and every citizen of this country. 

General public must desist from defacing and misusing these precious buildings and must make every effort to prevent the further degeneration of these jewels. 

I am happy to see that a beginning has been made in the recent years to build public-private partnerships to preserve and protect monuments and propagate cultural traditions and art forms. Many more such endeavours should be envisioned. 

The dedication of this heritage house to the nation and making its rich history available to everyone is the best tribute that can be paid to India’s immortal bard who always believed in the democratization of knowledge and wisdom.

I hope that this structure will prove to be an abode for students and knowledge seekers alike. Let me pay my tribute to Tagore by quoting what are perhaps the most powerful lines penned down by him.

“Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
By narrow domestic walls
Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake”.

May these verses forever serve as your compass in your journey forward. 

Thank You!

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has advised the Ministry of HRD to expedite the preparation of detailed project report on the proposed setting up of NCERT Regional Institute of Education at Nellore in Andhra Pradesh.

He also told the Union Minister for HRD, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal, who called on the Vice President at his residence today, to further strengthen the Center of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu located at Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysuru and shift the Center to a suitable location in either of the Telugu states (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana).

Shri Naidu also wanted the HRD Ministry to expedite the setting up of various educational institutions sanctioned under AP Reorganization Act.

The HRD Minister expressed his willingness to act on Vice President’s suggestions.

The foundation-stone for the Regional Institute of Education- NCERT was laid jointly by the Vice President of India on December 27 2016 when he was the Union Minister for Urban Development and Shri Prakash Javadekar, who was the Minister for HRD at that time.

The opening of the RIE fulfills the long-standing demand of the region. The new institution at Nellore shall offer teacher education programmes like B.Sc/BA B.Ed, M.Ed and Ph.D, apart from conducting research on education, it would help in capacity building of Teachers and Teacher Educators and strengthen implementation of Government of India Schemes like SSA, RMSA and ICT in schools. The State Government had allotted 50 acres of land free of cost on the National Highway at Kanupuru Bit-II, near NH-16 Venkatachalm Mandal, Nellore in Andhra Pradesh.

The Secretary Education, Shri R Subrahmanyam and Shri Hrushikesh Senapaty, Director NCERT and other senior officials were present at the meeting.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that empowering women, educating the girl child and making them equal partners in nation-building must be the focus of everyone. ‘Let us rededicate ourselves to upholding the dignity and respect of women in our country,’ he said.

Speaking to over 100 children from various Schools in Delhi who came to his residence to tie Rakhi on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, he said that the auspicious festival upholds the high place traditionally accorded to women in our society. He said that programmes such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao and Beti Badaao into people’s movements.

Describing Raksha Bandhan as a celebration of solidarity, unity, and humanism, the Vice President said that the festival was an ancient Indian tradition and it was a celebration of human bonding between sisters and brothers.

Saying that Raksha Bandhan was a symbol of care and protection and it upholds the values of Share and Care which is the core philosophy of India’s age-old traditions & customs, Shri Naidu opined that the festival has a larger significance for contemporary times and probably for all times.

The Vice President called upon people to take a pledge to usher in a New & Inclusive India where there would be no discrimination on the basis of gender, caste or community. He also wanted them to strive to promote the bonds of love, affection, brotherhood & harmonious co-existence by people of religions & regions.

The spouse of the Vice President, Smt. Usha Naidu was also present on the occasion and exchanged warm greetings with the children and tied Rakhi’s on the wrists of the ITBP and Delhi Police personnel who are deployed on security duties at the residence of the Vice President.

In a message, he said that as we celebrate the tremendous progress that our country has made in the last seven decades, let us not forget how hard-won our freedom is. Let us take a moment to salute those valiant freedom fighters whose courage and sacrifice freed our motherland from the shackles of colonial rule, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President's message: 

""I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of country on the joyous occasion of Independence Day.

Today, as we celebrate the tremendous progress that our country has made in the last seven decades, let us not forget how hard-won our freedom is. Let us take a moment to salute those valiant freedom fighters whose courage and sacrifice freed our motherland from the shackles of colonial rule. 

Today, India is a country that is brimming with potential, surging ahead on the path to all-round development. Our democracy is more vibrant than ever before and our commitment to good governance and transparency is stronger than ever before.

We must take steps to convert the Swaraj that the nation has achieved into Suraj and see that India of 21st Century is free of Hunger, Corruption, Discrimination, Illiteracy, Poverty, Caste Barriers and Urban-Rural Divide.

Peoples’ participation is essential and crucial to the nation’s progress.  Democracy thrives when the Government, Civil Society and citizens of the country work in unison to eliminate social evils and take collective & collaborative steps to take the nation forward.

On this important day, I urge upon everyone to treat programs like Swachh Bharat, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, More Crop - Per Drop, Environment & Water Conservation as people’s movements and participate in large numbers.

On this auspicious day, let us renew our pledge to uphold the country’s civilizational ideals and constitutional values and re dedicate ourselves to building an inclusive, peaceful, harmonious and progressive India.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asserted that dilution of Article 370 would strengthen the security, safety and integrity of India and should not be viewed through any other narrow prism. He was delivering the 1st Balramji Dass Tandon Memorial Lecture, at Panjab University in Chandigarh today. 

Stating that the state of Jammu and Kashmir has always been an integral part of our country and it would remain so.

The Vice President bemoaned that a section of the western media was indulging in false propaganda on the situation in Kashmir post dilution of Article 370.

In this context, Shri Naidu referred to a news article published by a national daily in 1964, the Vice President said that MPs cutting across party lines including those from ruling party almost unanimously supported a non official resolution seeking abrogation of Article 370.

Reading out details of the news item, Shri Naidu said that the non official resolution moved by Shri Prakash Vir Shastri in Lok Sabha was supported by leaders like Shri Ram Manohar Lohia. Of the 12 members who favoured abrogation of Article 370, seven belonged to the Congress including Inder J Malhotra, Sham Lal Saraf (from J&K) and K Hanumanthaiya, senior Congress leader from Karnataka

He also quoted a report published by another national daily in 1963 in which, the then Prime Minister Shri Jawahar Lal Nehru told the Lok Sabha that the process of gradual erosion of Article 370 was going on and fresh steps were being taken in that direction.

Speaking at the Balram Das Tandon Memorial Lecture in Chandigarh, he said the Parliament took the decision that this transitory provision needs to go and Jammu & Kashmir must be fully integrated with the rest of India.  “It is expected that this will pave the way for faster development of this State in the years to come. People across the country are rejoicing over the abrogation of Article 370,” he added.

Calling for a need to tone up administration, speed up judicial reforms and promoting healthy, constructive and meaningful debates in legislatures and Parliament, he said “Discuss, debate and decide…. decentralize and deliver” should become the agenda and the way forward for public representatives.

He also called upon political parties to adopt a code of conduct for people’s representatives including MPs and MLAs for effective functioning of Parliament and Legislatures. He also wanted the parties to incorporate the code of conduct in their election manifestoes.

Shri Naidu said that the legislature, the executive and the judicial processes must become more people-friendly.  He stressed the need for taking immediate steps to reduce heavy pendency at courts.

In order to streamline and make justice delivery more effective, the Vice President suggested time bound decisions on election petitions and criminal cases against sitting MPs and MLAs, including disqualification under the anti-defection law.

Shri Naidu also suggested revisiting the 10th Schedule of the Constitution, containing anti-defection provisions, to ensure a time bound disposal of such cases and make it more effective by plugging loopholes. 

Shri Naidu said that expanding the Supreme Court bench and having separate benches in different regions on trial basis as suggested by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice would help address the problem of pendency in judiciary and would save huge amount of money and energy of litigants who travel miles to reach Delhi.

The Governor of Punjab, Shri V.P. Singh Badnore, the Minister of State for Commerce & Industry, Shri Som Parkash, the Minister for School Education and Public Works, Punjab, Shri Vijay Inder Singla, the Vice Chancellor of Panjab University, Prof. Raj Kumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

Following is the text of Vice President's lecture in Hindi:

""स्वर्गीय बलराम दास टंडन जी की प्रथम पुण्य तिथि पर दिवंगत पुण्यात्मा को विनम्र श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित करता हूँ। और इस अवसर पर मुझे अपने विचार व्यक्त करने का अवसर देने के लिये आयोजनकर्त्ताओं का आभार व्यक्त करता हूँ।

अपने यशस्वी सार्वजनिक जीवन के अंतिम उत्तरदायित्व, छत्तीसगढ़ के राज्यपाल बनने से पहले तक, प्राय: पंजाब तथा निकटवर्ती क्षेत्र ही टंडन जी का कार्यक्षेत्र रहा। इस क्षेत्र में अपने सार्वजनिक जीवन में टंडन जी ने यश और प्रतिष्ठा अर्जित की, जिसे आज भी लोग आदर के साथ स्मरण करते हैं।

मित्रों,

टंडन जी के सामाजिक संस्कार तो युवावस्था में ही पड़ गये थे। आप उस पीढ़ी के प्रतिनिधि थे जिसने स्वाधीनता से पहले और बाद की राजनीति को निकट से देखा और उसमें रचनात्मक भाग भी लिया। 

वह दौर था जब राष्ट्रीय मुद्‌दों पर दलीय मतभेद न थे। सामाजिक, राजनैतिक कार्यकर्त्ता एक से अधिक राजनैतिक संगठन में सक्रिय रहते। देश का विभाजन, पंजाब पर विशेषकर भारी पड़ा था। इस प्रदेश को सबसे अधिक मानव त्रासदी, झेलनी पड़ी। ऐसे में, कई स्वयंसेवी युवा संगठन इस क्षेत्र में सक्रिय थे जो विभाजन से आयी आपदा में, शरणार्थियों, उनके जानमाल, सम्मान की रक्षा के लिये तत्पर थे। 

टंडन जी ने इस कठिन समय में राष्ट्रीय स्वयं सेवक संघ के प्रचारक के रूप में पंजाब और आसपास के क्षेत्रों-डलहौजी, चंबा में अथक परिश्रम किया। विभाजन से आये शरणार्थियों के लिये शिविर आयोजित किये। उन्हें मूलभूत सुविधाएं उपलब्ध कराने का प्रयास किया। 

वर्तमान पीढ़ी शायद ही जानती हो कि 1927 में अमृतसर में जन्में टंडन जी का सार्वजनिक जीवन 1953 में ही अमृतसर नगर निगम के सदस्य के रूप में प्रारंभ हुआ। 1957-77 तक आप 5 बार पंजाब विधान सभा के सदस्य रहे। इसके बाद आप 1997-2002 तक पुन: पंजाब विधान सभा के सदस्य बने। अपने विधायी जीवन में आपने तीन बार आपने पंजाब सरकार में मंत्री पद के दायित्व का निर्वाह भी किया।

अपने लंबे सार्वजनिक जीवन में, टंडन जी ने नि:स्वार्थ राष्ट्र सेवा, निष्ठापूर्ण समाज सेवा के प्रमाणिक मानदंड स्थापित किये जो जनप्रतिनिधियों और सामाजिक, राजनैतिक कार्यकर्त्ताओं की वर्तमान पीढ़ी के लिये आज भी उतने ही अनुकरणीय हैं।

1962 और 1965 युद्धों के दौरान आपने राष्ट्रीय उद्देश्यों के लिये जनसहयोग और जनभागीदारी को संगठित किया। साधारण नागरिक हर प्रकार से देश की सेनाओं को सहायता करने को तत्पर थे। जनता ने उदारतापूर्वक अपने स्वर्ण भूषण दान भी किये। आवश्यकता थी तो स्थानीय स्तर पर एक राष्ट्रनिष्ठ प्रमाणिक नेतृत्व की जो इन जन-प्रयासों को संगठित कर सके। उन्हें अभीष्ट लक्ष्य तक पहुँचा सके। लोगों को टंडन जी कार्यक्षमता, राष्ट्रनिष्ठा, और प्रमाणिकता पर पूरा विश्वास था। उनके नेतृत्व में सर्वदलीय कमेटी बनी तथा स्थानीय नागरिकों ने मनोयोग से अपना धन, देश की रक्षा के लिये दान कर दिया। 

इसी प्रकार 1965 के युद्ध में आपने सीमा पर तैनात सैनिकों के लिये अमृतसर जैसे सीमावर्ती जिले में कैंटीन सुविधा आयोजित कीं।

पंजाब में आतंकवाद के दिनों में टंडन जी सांप्रदायिक सौहार्द और शांति के लिये प्रयासरत रहे। इस दौरान आपके घर पर आतंकवादी हमले भी हुये। फिर भी अपनी और अपने परिजनों की सुरक्षा की चिंता किये बगैर, आप आतंकी घटनाओं से प्रभावित लोगों की सेवा करते रहे। उनके पुर्नवास के लिये समिति बनाई। गरीब परिवारों के लिये चिकित्सा और स्वास्थ्य सुविधाएं उपलब्ध कराई।

अपने सार्वजनिक जीवन में टंडन जी अनेक समाजसेवी संस्थाओं से सक्रिय रूप से जुड़े रहे और स्थानीय समुदाय की सेवा करते रहे जैसे  रक्तदान, नि:शुल्क शिक्षा, चिकित्सा, गरीब बेसहारा विधवाओं को नि:शुल्क राशन, वस्त्र उपलब्ध कराना। 

आज के जनप्रतिनिधियों को उनके कृतित्व से प्रेरणा लेनी चाहिये। आज हम बढ़ती आकांक्षाओं और रोज बदलती संभावनाओं के युग में रह रहे हैं। जनप्रतिनिधियों से जनअपेक्षाएं भी बढ़ी है। जनता हमसे अपेक्षा करती है कि हम उन मानदंडों का अनुसरण करें जो टंडन जी जैसे विभूतियों ने सार्वजनिक जीवन में स्थापित किये।

पारदर्शिता और निष्ठा के प्रति उनके आग्रह के बारें में मुझे उनके जीवन की कुछ घटनाएं बतायी गयी है। किस प्रकार आपातकाल के दौरान, माता की मृत्यु के बाद भी पैरोल बढ़ाने से इंकार कर दिया, मंत्री  रहते भी अपने कोटे का कोयला भी लेने से मना कर दिया कि अपेक्षित शासकीय शुचिता पर आंच न आये या फिर परिजनों को उनके मंत्री रहते सरकारी टेंडरों में आवेदन करने से मना कर दिया। ये सभी घटनाएं सार्वजनिक जीवन में शुचिता, पारदर्शिता के ऊंचे प्रतिमान स्थापित करती है। तभी जनता का लोकतांत्रिक संस्थाओं और जनप्रतिनिधियों में विश्वास बढ़ता है।

हमारे लोकतंत्र के लिये यह आवश्यक है कि जनप्रतिनिधि लोकतांत्रिक आदर्शों और संस्थाओं में जनता की आस्था को बनाये रखें। दलीय राजनीति, लोकतंत्र  में स्वाभाविक है। विभिन्न दल राजनैतिक विकल्प उपलब्ध कराते हैं। परंतु राष्ट्रहित और समाज के आदर्शों का कोई विकल्प नहीं होता। 

हाल के वर्षो में हमारे लोकतांत्रिक संस्थाओं से जनआकांक्षाएं बढ़ी है। लेकिन क्या हम उन आकांक्षाओं के साथ न्याय कर पा रहे हैं ?  हमारे विधायी संस्थान विचार-विमर्श और सहमति का माध्यम हैं, व्यवधान का नहीं। ऐसे समय में टंडन जी द्वारा स्थापित राष्ट्रनिष्ठा के मानदंडों का सदैव स्मरण रहना चाहिये। हर नागरिक को समाज हित और देश हित में अपने सूक्ष्म व्रतों को पूरा करने का संकल्प लेना चाहिये।

जनप्रतिनिधियों का विशेष दायित्व है कि ये लांकतांत्रिक मर्यादाओं और आस्थाओं को और दृढ़ करें। लोकनीति में आचरण विचारधारा से अधिक महत्वपूर्ण है। 

मेरा हमेशा मानना रहा है कि चुनाव भविष्य के विकास के एजेंडें पर लड़े  जाने चाहिये। उम्मीदवार की विचारधारा, आचरण, क्षमता, निष्ठा के आधार पर चुनाव होना चाहिये, न कि जाति, धर्म, क्षेत्र, धनबल, बाहुवल आदि के आधार पर। ये प्रवृत्तियां तो हमारे लोकतांत्रिक और सामाजिक संस्कारों को क्षीण करेंगे। मेरा आग्रह रहा है कि राजनैतिक दल अपने सदस्यों और विधायकों के लिये आचार संहिता बनायें जिससे राष्ट्रीय जीवन में हम वह आदर्श पुन: स्थापित कर सकें जिसे टंडन जी जैसे समाजसेवी नेताओं ने स्थापित किया।

मुझे यह भी बताया गया कि किस प्रकार टंडन जी ने राज्यपाल के रूप में, सरकार द्वारा बढ़ाये गये वेतन को लेने से इंकार कर दिया। वे वर्षों तक 18 संस्थाओं/व्यक्तियों को प्रतिमाह डोनेशन देते रहे। जीवन के अंतिम वर्ष में भी सभी लाभार्थियों को एकमुश्त डोनेशन दिया जिससे उनके देहांत के बाद भी लाभार्थियों की आवश्यकताएं पूर्ण हो सकें। भारतीय आश्रम परंपरा में, आदर्श वानप्रस्थी अनासक्त सेवा का यह उत्कृष्टतम उदाहरण है। टंडन जी जीवन पर्यन्त ही नहीं बल्कि देहावसान के बाद भी समाज का कल्याण सुनिश्चित कर गये। 

आपका कार्य शरीर, आपके द्वारा प्रतिष्ठित आदर्श, शाश्वत और अनुकरणीय हैं।  मैं पुण्यात्मा की पावन स्मृति को पुन: सादर वंदन करता हूँ। टंडन जी जैसे आदर्श व्यक्तित्व के विषय में अपने विचार साझा करने हेतु अवसर प्रदान करने के लिये आप सभी का आभार प्रकट करता हूँ।

जय हिंद ।

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for introducing structural reforms in the agricultural sector along with financial assistance schemes like Direct Benefit Transfer to make agriculture profitable and sustainable. 

He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Mukhya Mantri Krishi Ashirwad Yojna of the Jharkhand Government, in Ranchi, Jharkhand today. Lauding the Jharkhand government for coming up with the scheme, he expressed hope that it would go a long way in addressing agricultural distress in the state. 

Under the scheme, all the small and marginal farmers of the state, who have arable land up to a maximum of 5 acres, will be given a grant-in-aid at the rate of Rs. 5000 / - per acre per year, which will also reduce their dependence on loans. This amount would be given in two installments through Direct Benefit Transfer to the beneficiary’s bank account. This is in addition to PM Kisan Nidhi Yojana under which each small & marginal farmer’s family having combined landholding/ ownership of up to two hectares is paid Rs. 6, 000 per year, said the Vice President.

Shri. Naidu opined that Direct Benefit Transfer would eliminate middlemen and ensure that every penny of the financial assistance given by the government reaches the beneficiaries.

The Vice President said that the Government of India had taken a firm resolve to double the income of farmers by 2022. He added that the government was continuously increasing the minimum support price of food grains to achieve this objective. 

He asserted that our development would be meaningless until the benefits of progress reached the rural areas and made the lives of our farmers better. 

The Vice President also stressed the need for water conservation and said that “Conservation of natural resources like water is essential. For this, a massive campaign of rainwater conservation should be carried out, which will replenish our ground water”. 

He cautioned that groundwater levels are continuously falling due to uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater. Due to which the cost of irrigation is increasing. The Vice President also urged the farmers to adopt traditional techniques to support groundwater conservation.

The Governor of Jharkhand, Smt. Draupadi Murmu, the Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Shri Raghuvar Das, the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Shri Harivansh Narayan Singh, the Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Co-operative Department, Government of Jharkhand, Shri Randhir Kumar Singh and others were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address in Hindi:

""प्रिय भाईयो एवं बहनो सभी को नमस्कार एवं समस्त झारखंडवासियों को जोहार

प्रदेश के किसान भाइयों के लाभ के लिए मुख्यमंत्री कृषि आर्शीवाद योजना के शुभारंभ के अवसर पर, सावन के इस पवित्र माह में वैद्यनाथ धाम की इस पवित्र भूमि पर, आप सभी के बीच शामिल होकर अत्यंत प्रसन्नता का अनुभव कर रहा हूं। वर्षा ऋतु प्रकृति के नवसर्जन का समय है। जीवनदायी जल से तृप्त हो कर धरती हमे धनधान्य का आर्शीवाद देती है। इस अवसर पर आप सभी धरा-सेवी किसान भाइयों के बीच आकर धन्य महसूस कर रहा हूं।

मित्रों,

झारखंड कृषि प्रधान राज्य है। मुझे यह जानकर खुशी है कि झारखंड सरकार द्वारा किसानों के कल्याण एवं कृषि को बढ़ावा देने की दिशा में गंभीर प्रयास किये जा रहे हैं। मुझे बताया गया कि राज्य सरकार द्वारा कृषि को बढ़ावा देने हेतु जल संग्रहण एवं जल संचयन की योजना चलायी जा रही है, तालाब का जीर्णोद्धार, डीप बोरिंग एवं परकोलेशन टैंक का निर्माण किया रहा है, जिससे बढ़े क्षेत्रफल में अतिरिक्त सिंचाई सृजित हो सकेगी। 

मित्रों, मैं आग्रह करूंगा कि जल जैसे प्राकृतिक संसाधन का संचयन, संरक्षण आवश्यक है। इसके लिए वर्षा जल संरक्षण का व्यापक अभियान चलाया जाना चाहिए, जिससे धरती का जल स्तर बढ़े। यह चिंता का विषय है कि भूजल के अनियंत्रित दोहन से भूजल का स्तर लगातार नीचे गिर रहा है। जिससे सिंचाई की लागत बढ़ रही है। प्रधानमंत्री ने per drop, more crop का संदेश दिया है। मैं अपेक्षा करूंगा कि हमारे कृषक भाई अपने पारंपरिक तकनीक अपना कर भूजल संरक्षण में सहयोग देंगे। 

मुझे जानकर हर्ष है कि कृषि के यांत्रिकीकरण का कार्य भी हो रहा है। उन्नत बीज उपलब्ध कराने हेतु सरकार द्वारा बीज ग्राम का गठन सराहनीय पहल है। मुझे यह जानकर संतोष है कि कृषकों को योजनाओं का लाभ आसानी से मिल सके इसके लिए सिंगल विंडो सेंटर की व्यवस्था की गयी है। कृषि अनिश्चितताओं से भरा क्षेत्र है। अत: विपरीत परिस्थितियों में फसल की क्षति की भरपाई हेतु फसल बीमा योजना भी चलाई जा रही है। साथ ही किसानों की लागत कम करने के लिए किसान क्रेडिट कार्ड के माध्यम से किसानों को दिये जा रहे अल्पकालीन कृषि ऋण पर अतिरिक्त 3 प्रतिशत ब्याज माफ करने हेतु इंट्रेस्ट सबवेंशन की योजना भी चलाई जा रही है। राज्य सरकार की ये योजनाऐं स्वागत योग्य हैं।

आप जानते ही हैं कि भारत सरकार द्वारा किसानों की आय को 2022 तक दोगुना करने का संकल्प लिया गया है। इसी क्रम में सरकार 23 अनाजो के न्यूनतम समर्थन मूल्य को लगातार बढ़ा रही है। हमारे वनवासी भाइयों के लिये वन उत्पादों पर भी न्यूनतम समर्थन मूल्य तय किया जा रहा है। 

मुझे खुशी है कि किसानों की आमदनी बढ़ाने के संकल्प को पूरा करने के लिए राज्य सरकार द्वारा मुख्यमंत्री कृषि आर्शीवाद योजना का आज शुभारंभ किया जा रहा है। 

इस योजना में राज्य के सभी लघु एवं सीमांत किसान जिनके पास अधिकतम 5 एकड़ तक कृषि योग्य जमीन होगी उन्हें 5000/- रूपये प्रति एकड़ प्रति वर्ष की दर से सहायता अनुदान दिया जायेगा। जिन किसानों के पास कुल कृषि योग्य भूमि 0-1 एकड़ तक होगी, उन्हें 5000/- रूपये आर्थिक सहायता के रूप में दिये जायेंगे। मुझे विश्वास है कि इस राशि का उपयोग किसानों द्वारा कृषि कार्य हेतु किया जायेगा, जिससे उनके ऋण पर निर्भरता में भी कमी आयेगी। मुझे यह भी बताया गया है कि यह राशि दो किस्तों में दी जायेगी। इस योजना से सभी योग्य किसानों को प्रति वर्ष कम से कम 5000/- रूपये तथा अधिकतम 25000/- रूपये मिलेंगे और यह राशि किसानों को DBT के माध्यम से सीधा उनके बैंक खाते में भेजी जायेगी।

मित्रों,

विगत दशकों में देश में कृषि योग्य भू क्षेत्र में तो वृद्धि हुई है लेकिन यह चिंता का विषय है कि Holdings का आकार कम हो रहा है। एक अनुमान के अनुसार आगामी कुछ वर्षों में लगभग 90% Holdings 1 हैक्टेयर से कम क्षेत्रफल की होगी। आज कृषि पर आधारित लगभग 6.25 करोड़ परिवार 1 हैक्टेयर से कम की Holdings पर जिदंगी बसर कर रहे हैं। Holdings के आकार के साथ, ऐसे परिवारों की आमदनी भी कम होती है। लेकिन छोटी Holdings से ही अधिकतम पैदावार प्राप्त करने के लिए, किसानों द्वारा प्रयोग किये गये बीजों, खाद और रसायनों से लागत बढ़ती जाती है। इसी कारण अन्य देशों के मुकाबले हमारे देश में प्रति हैक्टेयर उत्पादकता भी कम है। ऐसे में सरकार द्वारा दी गयी यह सहायता सर्वथा स्वागत योग्य है।

मुझे हर्ष है कि राज्य सरकार द्वारा इस वर्ष राज्य के लगभग 35 लाख किसानों को लाभ पहुंचाने का लक्ष्य रखा गया है। जिसके प्रथम चरण में आज लगभग 10 लाख किसानों के बीच प्रथम किस्त के रूप में राशि 380.00 करोड़ रूपये का वितरण किया जा रहा है। मुझे विश्वास है कि यह योजना किसानों की आय दोगुनी करने के लक्ष्य में सहायक साबित होगी। 

मैं पुन: राज्य सरकार को इस योजना की शुरुआत करने के लिए बधाई देता हूं तथा सभी किसानों को शुभकामना देता हूं। इस अवसर पर मैं किसान बंधुओं से आग्रह करूंगा कि कृषि आधारित सूक्ष्म उद्यम या शिल्प या अन्य ग्रामीण उद्योगों को भी लगाएं, इससे न केवल आमदनी बढ़ेगी और ग्रामीण उद्यमिता बढ़ेगी बल्कि कृषि उत्पादकता भी बढ़ेगी। आपके विकास से ही राज्य का विकास संभव है। 

मैं पुन: इस योजना को शुरु करने हेतु राज्य सरकार को बधाई देता हूं।

जय हिंद।""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venakaih Naidu has said that abrogation of article 370 was welcomed by people cutting across all political lines in the country. 

Participating in the 35th Foundation Day celebrations of Prabhat Khabar, a Hindi daily, in Ranchi, Jharkhand today, the Vice President said the need of the hour was to protect India’s unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country. “As regards to the country’s unity and integrity, we all should speak in one voice,” he added.

Shri Naidu expressed happiness that both the houses of Parliament passed the resolution after a thorough discussion. While it was passed with – 2/3rd majority in Rajya Sabha, it secured the support of - 4/5th members of Lok Sabha. ‘’It speaks about the wishes of the people of the country and that is the mood of the country’ he added.

The Vice President said that there was a need for the younger generation of the country to know about Article 370 and its constitutional history. 

Pointing out that Article 370 was a temporary and transient provision, the Vice President mentioned that way back in 1964, MPs cutting across party lines including those from ruling party almost unanimously supported a non official resolution seeking its abrogation. 

Reading out details of the news item published by a National English daily at that time, the Vice President said that the non official resolution moved by Shri Prakash Vir Shastri in Lok Sabha was supported by leaders like Shri Ram Manohar Lohia, Shri H.V. Kamat, Shri K. Hanumantaiya and others. 

Quoting from the same news report, he said that the members from Kashmir argued that the state had suffered by not being treated on par with the rest of the country. 

Referring to the positive and constructive role of the Fourth Estate, the Vice President advised the media to present only facts and unadulterated news and leave the judgment to people. “Do not mix news and views,” he added.

Shri Naidu said that journalism was once considered as a mission to transform the society and the country he observed that a section of the media today was not adhering to the principles and was giving remission to truth. 

The Vice President cautioned the media to guard against fake and paid news and follow a strict verification mechanism before publishing or broadcasting news developments. He suggested that electronic media should also have its own regulation mechanism on the lines of the Press Council of India. 

The Governor of Jharkhand, Smt Draupadi Murmu, the Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Shri Raghubar Das, the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Shri Harivansh and other eminent personalities from media were present at the event.

Following is the text of Vice President's address in Hindi:

""झारखंड प्रदेश के प्रतिष्ठित समाचार पत्र प्रभात खबर के 35 में वार्षिक समारोह में आप सभी सम्मानित महानुभावों के साथ सम्मिलित होकर अत्यंत हर्ष का अनुभव कर रहा हूं। 

80 के दशक में मात्र 500 की सरकुलेशन से आरंभ कर आज आप 8 लाख से अधिक सरकुलेशन तक पहुंच गए हैं। आपके लगभग 1.5 करोड़ पाठक हैं। बिहार, बंगाल और झारखंड में आपके 10 संस्करण प्रकाशित होते हैं। यह उपलब्धि आपकी निर्भीक पत्रकारिता के प्रति निष्ठा और उसमें जनता के विश्वास को दर्शाती है। आपकी उपलब्धि न केवल अभिनंदनीय है, बल्कि भारतीय पत्रकारिता के लिए एक शुभ संकेत भी है।

पिछले 35 वर्षों में आपकी यात्रा अखबार से आंदोलन बनने वाली यात्रा रही है और आंदोलन तभी बनते हैं जब उनको जनसमर्थन प्राप्त हो और जनता का विश्वास हो। गत तीन दशकों में आपने जनता का विश्वास अर्जित किया है यह आपकी निर्भीक और निष्पक्ष पत्रकारिता का परिणाम है। 

प्रभात खबर से मेरा विशेष नाता रहा है। मेरे सहयोगी राज्य सभा के उपसभापति श्री हरिवंश जी इस पत्र से कई वर्षों तक करीब से जुड़े रहे। मैंने भी समय-समय पर इस पत्र में सामयिक विषयों पर तथा देश की महान विभूतियों के कृतित्व पर अपने आलेखों के माध्यम से पाठकों से संवाद किया है। मुझे यह जानकर अत्यंत हर्ष है कि अब यह आंदोलन अखबार से आगे बढ़कर रेडियो तथा ऑनलाइन मीडिया से भी जुड़ गया है। 

मित्रों, मीडिया स्वस्थ लोकतंत्र का न केवल एक अंग है बल्कि एक अपरिहार्य शर्त भी है। मीडिया को लोकतांत्रिक व्यवस्था का चौथा स्तंभ माना गया है। गांधी जी ने तो कहा भी था कि आज लोग पवित्र ग्रंथों से अधिक प्रेस पर विश्वास करते है। यह बात अतिश्योक्ति लग सकती परंतु इसमें वर्तमान समाज की सच्चाई भी है। यद्यपि हमारे संविधान में प्रेस की आजादी को खुले तौर पर मूल अधिकार नहीं माना गया है – तथापि संविधान सभा की बहस से ज्ञात होता है कि मीडिया की स्वतंत्रता को अभिव्यक्ति की मौलिक स्वतंत्रता का ही विस्तार मानने पर सर्वसहमति थी। उसके बाद उच्चतम न्यायालय के अनेक निर्णयों ने इस मान्यता को वैधानिकता भी प्रदान की। महात्मा गांधी ने कहा था कि प्रेस की स्वतंत्रता बेशकीमती है-जिसे कोई भी देश नहीं खोना चाहेगा।

आपातकाल के कड़वे अनुभव के बाद, हमारी संसद में मीडिया की स्वतंत्रता के प्रति सर्वसम्मति रही है। जहां बाकी तीन स्तंभों के लिए संविधान में प्रावधान है, मीडिया को जन विश्वास प्राप्त है। आपको ज्ञात होगा कि हमारे स्वाधीनता आंदोलन में तब के पत्रों, विशेषकर भारतीय भाषाई पत्रों ने महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई थी। देश का बौद्धिक वर्ग इन्हीं पत्रों के माध्यम से स्वाधीनता आंदोलन का समर्थन कर रहा था। हमारे नेताओं ने अपने पत्र प्रकाशित किये और जनसमर्थन को जोड़ा।

मित्रों, इलेक्ट्रॉनिक और डिजिटल मीडिया के इस दौर में भी प्रिंट मीडिया का महत्व बरकरार है। शब्दों का सौंदर्य, विचारों का विस्तार, पत्रकारिता की गंभीरता, अभिव्यक्ति की मर्यादा-अखबार के पन्नों में ही दिखते हैं। टेक्नोलॉजी के इस युग में मीडिया के नए माध्यम तो आएंगे ही लेकिन लिखे हुए शब्दों की मर्यादा सदैव बरकरार रहेगी। मनुष्य ने सदियों के प्रयासों के बाद अपने विचारों को लिपिबद्ध करना सीखा है। अत: लिखे हुए शब्दों की विश्वसनीयता, उसकी गंभीरता आज भी सभी स्वीकारते हैं। 

अखबारों के ऑनलाइन संस्करण आने से न केवल अखबारों की लोकप्रियता में वृद्धि हुई बल्कि अब अखबारों के किसी भी संस्करण को और यहां तक कि पुराने अखबारों को कहीं पर भी, किसी समय भी, अपने स्मार्टफोन और पढ़ा जा सकता है। टेक्नोलॉजी ने वस्तुत: अखबारों की लोकप्रियता को बढ़ाया ही है। 

मित्रों, 

यदि मीडिया लोकतंत्र का चौथा स्तंभ है तो लोकतांत्रिक व्यवस्था में इसकी भूमिका और महत्वपूर्ण हो जाती है। मीडिया की विश्वसनीयता जनता के सरोकारों और जन विश्वास पर ही टिके होते हैं। मीडिया राष्ट्रीय संसाधन है। जिसे पत्रकार बंधु जन विश्वास या ट्रस्ट में प्रयोग करते हैं। इसलिए आवश्यक है कि मीडिया जनसरोकारों के प्रति सत्यनिष्ठ रहें। महात्मा गांधी ने कहा था कि पत्रकार का कर्तव्य है कि वह देश के जनमानस का पढ़ें और निर्भीक हो कर उसे मुखर अभिव्यक्ति दें। उन्होंने कहा था कि पत्रकारिता का उद्देश्य मात्र समाज सेवा ही होना चाहिए। महात्मा गांधी के ये वचन, आज भी पत्रकारिता के लिए मूलमंत्र के समान हैं। 

मित्रों,

संसद और मीडिया एक दूसरे के सहयोगी हैं। दोनों ही संस्थान जनभावनाओं को अभिव्यक्ति देते हैं। आज जब हम बढ़ती और बदलती जनअपेक्षाओं के युग में रह रहे हैं तब आवश्यक है कि हम भी अपने स्थापित पूर्वाग्रहों को त्यागें और जन अपेक्षाओं को स्वर दें। मीडिया को भी विकासवादी सकारात्मक राजनीति का वाहक बनना होगा। मीडिया सरकारों और राजनैतिक दलों की जवाबदेही अवश्य तय करे परंतु उसके केन्द्र में जनसरोकार हों न कि सत्ता संस्थान। मीडिया यथा स्थितिवादी राजनीति में बदलाव का कारक बने। मीडिया को दलीय राजनीति से ऊपर उठकर जनकेन्द्रित मुद्दे उठाने चाहिए। 

हाल के चुनावों में, प्रचार के दौरान मीडिया में कुछ नयी खेदजनक प्रवृत्तियां दिखी है। पेड न्यूज, फेक न्यूज, सोशल मीडिया का अनियंत्रित प्रयोग इन सब विषयों पर मीडिया को सम्मिलित रूप से चिंता करनी चाहिए और व्यावहारिक निदान सुझाने चाहिए। 

चुनाव लोकतंत्र का पवित्र यज्ञ है जिसमें सभी मतदाता भाग लेते हैं। अफवाहों, मिथ्यारोपों से बचाकर इस प्रक्रिया की शुचिता बनाये रखना हमारे स्वस्थ लोकतंत्र के लिए आवश्यक है। 

चुनाव भविष्य के विकास के ऐजेंडे पर लड़े जाने चाहिए। उम्मीदवार के आचरण, विचारधारा, क्षमता और निष्ठा के आधार पर चुनाव होना चाहिए, न कि जाति, धर्म, बाहुबल, धन बल या आपराधिक पृष्ठभूमि के आधार पर। 

चुनाव हमारे नागरिकों विशेषकर युवाओं की अपेक्षाओं की अभिव्यक्ति है। मैं मीडिया से आग्रह करूंगा कि वे जाति, धर्म के संकीर्ण सीमाओं से ऊपर उठकर युवाओं, महिलाओं, किसानों, उद्यमियों की अपेक्षाओं को स्वर दें।

मित्रों,

कुछ समय बाद राज्य में फिर चुनाव होंगे - एक बार पुन: मीडिया को अवसर मिलेगा कि वे जनसरोकारों, जन भागीदारी को चुनाव के केन्द्र में रखें। प्राय: देखा गया है कि चुनावों के दौरान मीडिया में मतदान और मतदाताओं के जातीय विश्लेषण किये जाते हैं। इससे समाज में जातीय और सांप्रदायिक विभाजन और गहरे होते हैं, जो स्वस्थ राजनीति के उद्देश्य को ही विफल कर देते हैं। मैं आग्रह करूंगा कि देश में लोकतंत्र के नये संस्कारों को विकसित करें।

मित्रों,

यदि मीडिया में लोकतांत्रिक संस्कारों को दृढ़ करना है तो पत्रकारिता के केन्द्र में जनसरोकारों को रखना होगा। यहां पर स्थानीय समाचार पत्रों की महती भूमिका रहती है। आप न केवल स्थानीय अपेक्षाओं को प्रतिबिंबित करते है बल्कि भारतीय भाषाओं में प्रकाशित होने के कारण आप जनाकांक्षाओं के अधिक निकट हैं। आप स्थानीय विशेषज्ञों और विद्वानों को मीडिया में अपना मत प्रकट करने का अवसर देते हैं।

मेरा आग्रह होगा कि प्रेस का ध्यान सत्ता संस्थानों के अतिरिक्त जन सहयोग, जनसरोकारों पर भी होना चाहिए। आखिर झारखंड में पहाड़ की तलहटी में बसे दो गावों-आरा और केरम के निवासियों द्वारा किये जल संरक्षण के प्रयासों को देश के अन्य भागों तक क्यों नहीं पहुंचाया जाना चाहिए। सरकार द्वारा घोषित वन उत्पादों के समर्थन मूल्य जैसी कल्याणकारी योजनाओं की जानकारी हमारे वनवासी भाइयों को होनी ही चाहिए, झारखंड में खुले में शौच से मुक्त करने हेतु जन अभियान की सफलता से देश को परिचित कराया जाना चाहिए। जन सरोकार के इन विषयों पर जन शिक्षण करना आज पत्रकारिता का तकाज़ा है।

स्वच्छता अभियान को जनआंदोलन बनाने में मीडिया की भूमिका अभिनंदनीय रही है। स्थानीय समुदाय में नागरिकों द्वारा किये जा रहे – सकारात्मक प्रयासों, परिवर्तनों से वृहत्तर देश को अवगत कराऐं। सामुदायिक स्तर पर जल संरक्षण, पर्यावरण संरक्षण, नवउद्यम जैसे सकारात्मक प्रयासों को पत्रकारिता में स्थान दें। आपके प्रयासों से जनता का विश्वास बढ़ेगा, सामुदायिक चेतना बढ़ेगी।

गत 35 वर्षों की आपकी यात्रा यशस्वी रही। मुझे विश्वास है कि भविष्य में संचार क्रांति के दौर में भी प्रभात खबर समाज में सकारात्मक हस्तक्षेप करता रहेगा। आप सभी को मेरी शुभकामनाऐं।

जय हिंद।""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that people of the country must be active participants in governance to fast-track the process of development. He said that merely enacting legislations would not create solutions to problems and stressed that laws must be backed by political skill and administrative will.

 

The Vice President was addressing the gathering at the 117th Birth Anniversary celebrations of Shri Gujar Mal Modi, after presenting the Gujar Mal Modi Innovative Science and Technology Awards 2019 to Prof. S.K. Satheesh and Dr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan (Padma Bhushan) at Vigyan Bhawan, here today. Shri. Naidu lauded the Gujar Mal Modi Science Foundation for their initiative of encouraging scientists and innovators and said that we must preserve the age old Indian tradition of honouring excellence, to motivate the younger generations to do well.

 

Shri Naidu called for innovative and out-of-box solutions to formidable challenges like poverty, pollution, climate change, diseases, not-so-profitable agriculture and low-efficiency industrial processes.

 

Calling for a culture of innovation, the Vice President said that innovation was imperative to address these challenges and take India forward on the path to inclusive and sustainable development at a faster pace.

 

The Vice President called for a reorientation of the education system to promote creativity. Asserting that foundations for the culture of innovation must be laid in our schools and colleges, he observed that a ‘new model of education’ was needed.

 

“We must build on the ‘best practices’ we have developed over centuries as learners, and create ‘next practices’ that would suit our vision for our future,” he added.

 

Saying that research in basic sciences forms the bedrock of all technological advancement, Shri Naidu said that it was crucial to create an environment where the government, universities, corporate houses, and others come together to propel the entire science eco-system forward with special emphasis on sustainability.

 

Expressing his desire to develop Indian universities into centers of excellence in basic sciences as well as cutting edge technology, Shri Naidu said that our universities must become the power houses of research and development.

 

Observing that innovation and entrepreneurship must hand in hand, the Vice President said that universities must serve as safe spaces for entrepreneurship to flourish.

 

The Vice President presented Gujar Mal Modi Innovative Science and Technology Awards to Prof. S.K. Satheesh and Dr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan (Padma Bhushan). The President of the Gujar Mal Modi Science Foundation, Shri. Satish Kumar Modi, trustees of the foundation, Shri. Krishan Kumar Modi, Shri. Umesh Kumar Modi and others were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am delighted to be with the Modi family and all of you to participate in the 117th  Birth Anniversary celebrations of late Shri Gujar Mal Modi, and to felicitate Prof. S.K. Satheesh and Dr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan (Padma Bhushan) with the ‘Gujar Mal Modi Award-2019’.

On this occasion, I pay tribute to Shri Gujar Mal Modi, the founder of the Modi Group of Industries, who was a great humanitarian. He was one of the prominent architects of modern industrial India

I am told that Bahadur Gujar Mal Modi undertook several welfare initiatives for his employees and their families. He built schools, educational institutions, hospitals, temples and residential complexes for them. He believed in taking peoples’ wealth back to people and made conscious efforts to plough back a large part of the profit made by his business undertakings for social good. 

Shri Gujar Mal Modi was presented the prestigious Padma Bhushan by the Government of India, in recognition of his achievements as an enterprising industrialist and for his immense philanthropic work. 

Today, the Modi Family is celebrating the 117th birth anniversary of this great philanthrope.

I am glad to know that, since 1988, the Foundation has already recognized thirty three personalities of the country who have excelled in their respective fields. The list includes Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Dr. Anil Kakodkar, Prof. M.G.K. Menon and Dr. Kasturirangan.

I am happy to know that the Jury, under the chairmanship of Dr. K. Kasturirangan, former Member, Planning Commission, has decided to honour Prof. S.K. Satheesh and Dr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan this year. 

Prof. S.K. Satheesh, the Chairman of Divecha Centre for Climate Change and Professor of Centre for Atmosperic and Oceanic Sciences at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has made outstanding contributions to understanding the significant impact of light – absorbing atmospheric aerosol particles on the radiation balance of the Earth-atmosphere system and regional climate. 

Prof. Satheesh’s efforts in the assessment of the radiative impact of aerosols, which is widely used in climate models to study monsoon, are indeed praiseworthy. I extend my hearty congratulations to him for the honour that he received today. 


	Bhushan Dr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan from Kashmir, is currently the Chair of the Health Systems Transformation Platform, established by the Tata Trusts and of the Technical Advisory Group of the National Biopharma Mission. 


I am glad to note that his pioneering research lead to development of a Rotavirus vaccine from a novel virus strain he isolated at AIIMS, New Delhi. The vaccine developed through a decade long effort is now delivered through the country’s immunization program and used in other developing countries. Over 100 million of this vaccine doses given to children in last few years has saved countless lives. His efforts have inspired translational biomedical science and innovation by Indian academia and industry.

He is globally recognized as an innovation leader in medical research and technology development. I congratulate Dr. Bhan on his outstanding achievements. 

It is common knowledge that research in basic sciences form the bedrock of all technological advancement. It is crucial to create an environment where the government, universities, corporate houses and others come together to propel the entire science eco-system forward with special emphasis on sustainability. 

One way to motivate and encourage talented youngsters is by recognizing and applauding the accomplishments of our researchers and scientists, a step taken by the G.M. Modi Foundation years ago. My congratulations to this Foundation for encouraging scientists in the way you have been doing for the past 31years.

My dear brothers and sisters,      

I am sure that all of you are aware of the tremendous progress that our country is making on several fronts. We have a stable democracy and a vibrant economy. We have huge potential in our demography with 65% of the population being below 35 years of age. 

I strongly believe that for India to move ahead on the path of inclusive and sustainable development, at a faster pace, innovation is an imperative. Today, we face a number of formidable challenges like poverty, pollution, climate change, diseases, not-so-profitable agriculture, and low-efficiency industrial processes. 

We have to find solutions to these problems using the limited resources that are available to us. 

Innovation and out-of-box solutions are the only way forward.

Innovation is a culture, a mindset. 

Once you have an innovation culture, even those who are not scientists or engineers would also embrace innovation and scientific literacy. Thus innovation would get embedded as one of the core values of a society, promoting economic growth and development. 

This culture of constant innovation is what India needs today, it is what will make India a global leader. 

Investing in innovation is investing in a bright future. 

The foundation for this culture of innovation must be laid in our schools and colleges. 

Children are born with a natural curiosity about the world around us. This curiosity is the foundation of all invention. We must encourage our children to ask questions, to critique and to reject the irrational. 

Our education system must be overhauled to inspire creativity and curiosity. It must seek to turn this native curiosity among children into knowledge that gives us the power to invent, to find solutions to problems.

We must build a new model of education together, a model that does not resist change but remains forever open and adaptable. We must build on the ‘best practices’ we have developed over centuries as learners, and create ‘next practices’ that would suit our vision for our future.

A start has been made through initiatives like ‘Atal Tinkering labs’ set up in more than 5500 schools in India, under the Atal Innovation Mission, to foster curiosity, creativity, and imagination in young minds and inculcate skills such as design mindset, computational thinking, adaptive learning, physical computing etc.. Many more such initiatives which serve as platforms for innovation, should come up. 

Our universities must serve as centres for excellence in basic sciences as well as cutting edge technology. They must be power houses of research and development. 

To meet this objective, the research projects that are undertaken by our universities must live up to international standards and benchmarks. It has very often been said that a major weakness of Indian education and research is the relatively very small part played by the universities in the sum total of Indian research. 

At the institutional level, there is a need to link teaching with research. The government needs to invest in faculty development, provide incentives for research, promote collaborative efforts between institutions in research.

Our universities must move beyond adopting technology to embracing it.

Initiatives such as outcome based research financing, setting up of Incubation Centers for innovative research and setting up Research Parks in central educational institutions can go a long way in making our universities thriving knowledge-creation centres. 

Unlike in the past, tight boundaries between various disciplines have almost disappeared. Today’s researchers cannot confine themselves to compartmentalized silos and must have a basic understanding of other related disciplines. The issues are also no longer discipline-specific and cut across several disciplines. A holistic research approach needs to be adopted in an inter-disciplinary manner.

For example, health, education and environment are of immense concern to all and cannot be confined to particular disciplines.

The canvas of new research both in science and social science is vast and will definitely help young researchers to get a wider perspective on various phenomena. The emerging areas in bio-technology, genetic engineering, biodiversity, new materials, micro-machines, bio-medical simulations and equipment, new dominions in space research and technology including permanent human habitat in space, and similar new frontiers in oceans, are some of the examples.

I urge our educational institutions to come together for creating new knowledge at the intersections of existing disciplines.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Much is being said about promoting entrepreneurship. The priority accorded by the government to innovation is clearly reflected in missions such as ‘start-up India’ and Stand-up India’. 

I strongly believe that innovation and entrepreneurship go hand in hand. Our universities must serve as safe spaces for entrepreneurship to flourish. We must encourage our brilliant youngsters to collaborate and work together in teams to come up with business ideas that are feasible, sustainable and most importantly, socially relevant.

The ultimate aim of all innovation is the betterment of the human condition, the alleviation of suffering and the promotion of stability, peace and harmony. 

I urge all of you, especially young innovators to have a big vision and then take small steps to realize your vision. Sometimes, innovation is not about cutting edge technology, it is about simple solutions to complex problems. India is a country that is well known for its frugal innovations. We must keep this competitive advantage of ours alive and use it to the best possible extent to defeat challenges. 

Let me also caution you that every single cutting edge technology brings with it its own disruptive interventions. We as a society must be mature and prudent enough to manage these disruptions which are very often paradigm altering. 

Let me impress upon you that Science is a moving target, forever advancing and progressing. We need to keep ourselves updated and be ready to work hard.

I once again congratulate Prof. S.K. Satheesh and Dr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan. I hope that the legacy of philanthropic activities left behind by Bahadur Gujar Mal Modi will be carried forward by his family in the times to come. I wish all of you all the very best in your future endeavours. 

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India and the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon all political parties to incorporate a code of conduct for people’s representatives, including MPs and MLAs, in their election manifestos.

The code of conduct should include stipulations that the members would not enter the well of the house, nor resort to sloganeering and disruptions or any other unruly behavior such as tearing papers and throwing them in the House.

Shri Naidu, who hosted a lunch to senior officials of Rajya Sabha and media persons at Upa Rashtrapati Bhawan, here today, expressed his happiness over the productive session of the just concluded session of Parliament. He said that Rajya Sabha achieved a history of sorts in the number of questions raised and answered, special mentions and zero hour mentions during the session.

“With 32 bills passed during the 35 sittings of the recently concluded Rajya Sabha session, this has been the best in the last 17 years in terms of legislative output,” he added.

The Vice President said that he was sure that the leadership and MPs of all political parties would appreciate the significance of functional Parliament and would maintain the positive momentum of the just concluded session.

The Rajya Sabha Chairman said that he has always been emphasizing the need for members to discuss, debate and decide and not resort to disruptions and obstructions in Parliament and Legislatures as people were becoming restless over such behaviour.

Shri Naidu also expressed concern over the tendency of the opposition parties to boycott the legislature in some states, while in certain other instances the opposition was sent out. In some states, the assembly was meeting for very few days, while there was continuous disruption in some others. 

The Vice President appealed to all political parties to see that Parliament and Legislatures function effectively and also to ensure that the quality of debates was raised.  He said “there is a feeling among the people that the level of public discourse is going down.”

Pointing out that political parties were only rivals and not enemies, he was of the firm opinion that the ruling and the opposition parties should interact more frequently to ensure smooth conduct of both Parliament and legislatures.  

Observing that Parliamentary democracy was all about ensuring governance through accountability to the people, Shri Naidu described as “Legislative, Deliberative and Accountability” the three important functions of legislatures. “We are supposed to make necessary legislations for the betterment of the country and the people, take up and deliberate on issues of public importance and ensure the accountability of the government of the day”.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the twin objectives of people should to be to get rid of various social evils like – corruption and caste discrimination and to fulfill their social responsibilities towards building a New India. 

Speaking briefly after planting a sapling in the premises of the Parliament, here today, the Vice President paid tributes to the heroes of the freedom struggle on the occasion of Quit India Movement Day. He said the need of the hour was to quit and get rid of social evils including poverty and inequalities.   

Besides taking up tree plantation, the Vice President called upon people to promote rainwater harvesting and water conservation in a big way and make them people's movements on the lines of Swachh Bharat. “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle should be the mantra for conserving water,” he added.

Observing that tree plantation must be undertaken by every individual to make the planet greener and cleaner, the Vice President said trees help in maintaining the balance of ecosystems and protecting biodiversity. He asked children and the youth to actively participate in such constructive programs.

“Everyone must love and live with nature. Protect Nature and Preserve Culture for a Better Future,” the Vice President added.

The Secretary General of Rajya Sabha, Shri Desh Deepak Verma and other senior officials were present on the occasion.

                The Vice President, Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu, today said that religious harmony and unity in diversity are cherished values of our civilization and asked every citizen of the nation to strive to preserve our values of national integration.

He was addressing the Second Convocation ceremony of Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya in Indore, Madhya Pradesh today.

The Vice President commended the efforts of 135-year-old Shri Vaishnav Committee and the Group of Trusts, Indore in establishing Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya (SVVV) to impart quality education.

Stating that there was a need for rejuvenation and renaissance in our education system to make it world class, Shri. Naidu said that educational institutions must focus on academic excellence, physical fitness, mental alertness, moral uprightness and social conscience.

He urged universities to strive to overcome challenges of quality, equity and access in education through the creation of knowledge networks, research and innovation centres, skill development programs and support for faculty development.

The Vice President said that, with technology making deep inroads in our day-to-day lives, there is a greater need today to align academic curriculum in accordance with changing technological developments and to stay ahead of the curve for the country to reach greater heights. 

He spoke of the need for India to upscale research facilities to produce world class publications in reputed international journals. ‘Research is an area where we are lagging behind and serious efforts are needed to bolster the culture of research and innovation in the country’, he said. 

Highlighting the importance of preserving our rich culture, especially our languages, the Vice President also opined that mother tongue should be the primary medium of instruction in schools till the high school level. 

Shri. Naidu also called for enhanced collaboration between academia and industry and urged the industry to earmark CSR funds for promoting collaboration with the academia and research activities.

Referring to India’s impending demographic dividend, Shri. Naidu said that India had the potential to become the human resource centre of the world. He said that quality education, skills, knowledge and creative thinking are essential to realize the demographic dividend and to make India a 21st century innovation hub. 

The Vice President said that we must turn our educational institutions into centres of excellence with global standards. ‘’Our universities and educational institutional institutions must attain great heights and figure in top-ranking global academic institutions’, he added.

Observing that the majority of students who win awards for merit and excellence in universities are women, the Vice President said that women’s education and empowerment must become people’s movements.

Shri. Naidu emphasized that there is a need for inculcating the qualities of sharing and caring among youngsters. ‘They need to have empathy for others, particularly for the vulnerable and marginalized sections of the society’, he said.

He urged the students to continuously update themselves with the latest technologies, innovations and the changes in the world. He advised them to think of the nation first and to work hard with determination to realize their dreams and the aspirations of more than a billion people.

He advised students to firmly adhere to the path of righteousness and remain committed to upholding ethics and morals at all times.

The Governor of Madhya Pradesh, Shri. Lal Ji Tandon, the Minister of Public Health and Family Welfare, Government of Madhya Pradesh, Shri. Tulsiram Silawat, the Minister of Higher Education, Government of Madhya Pradesh, Shri. Jitu Patwari, former Speaker, Lok Sabha, Smt. Sumitra Mahajan and others were present at the occasion.

 

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am indeed delighted to address all of you on the occasion of Second Convocation of Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya.

At the outset, let me congratulate all the degree and medal recipients. I also convey my greetings to all the parents on this memorable occasion.

The efforts of 135-year-old Shri Vaishnav Committee and the Group of Trusts, Indore in establishing Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya (SVVV) to impart quality education are worthy of appreciation.

Over the years, the role of the private sector in Indian higher education has increased significantly and many outstanding private institutions across the country have contributed towards providing quality education to people. 

However, higher education in the country continues to face many fundamental challenges of access, equity, affordability and quality. Although India’s higher education system is the third largest in the world in terms of enrollment, next only to China and the United States, its Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) at 25.4% significantly lags behind other countries like China, which, currently, has an enrollment ratio of 43.39% and USA, which has 85.8%.

Also, there is a wide disparity in GERs across states, urban and rural areas and gender. We need to address this issue on a war footing. Quality of faculty and infrastructure need to be further enhanced.

I am confident that the private universities and institutions will play an instrumental role in overcoming these challenges through the creation of knowledge networks, research and innovation centres, skill development programs and support for faculty development.

With technology making deep inroads in our day-to-day lives, there is a greater need today than ever before to align academic curriculum in accordance with changing technological developments. As a matter-of-fact, we not only need to keep abreast of the latest technological trends, but strive to stay ahead of the curve for the country to reach greater heights. 

To this effect, I would like to impress upon all academic establishments and the UGC, AICTE to completely revamp the curricula and teaching methods, utilize latest IT tools and promote the culture of research in a big way. We need to upscale the research facilities to produce world class publications in reputed international journals. Research is an area where we are lagging behind and serious efforts are needed to bolster the culture of research and innovation in the country. 

Another area that needs a huge boost is the collaboration between academia and industry. In fact, the industry must earmark CSR funds for promoting collaboration with the academia and research activities. The students coming out of our institutions should be innovative and creative to meet the requirements of the technology-driven world. In essence, a stronger collaboration between academic institutions and industry must evolve.

India is very soon going to have the largest population of youth in the world. This is India’s demographic dividend. India can become the human resource centre of the world. We cannot any longer continue with status quo. We must turn our educational institutions into centres of excellence with global standards.

As we all are aware, India was once known as ‘Vishwaguru’ and was home to the world’s best universities. Our universities and educational institutional institutions must again attain such heights and figure in top-ranking global academic institutions. For that to happen, all stakeholders in the educational field must make relentless and dedicated efforts.

The potential of demographic dividend can be realized if every segment contributes in its capacity to the fullest. In order to benefit from the capabilities of our youth, educational institutions must also involve them in community development activities. There is a need for inculcating the qualities of sharing and caring among youngsters. They need to have empathy for others, particularly for the vulnerable and marginalized sections of the society.

My dear students, your hard work of years has today culminated into an academic degree. Don’t look at this degree as an end to your education. Rather, it should serve as a catalyst for further pursuits of knowledge. Education is the most powerful weapon to change the world. Change is the only constant.

And to keep up with this change, learning should not be seen as an end but as a means to achieve greater heights in life. You should continuously update yourself with the latest technologies, innovations and the changes in the world. Belief is one of the most powerful tools behind the success of a person—be it personal or professional.

Dear students,

My advice to all of you is to think of the nation first. No doubt, you must all be dreaming of building a great career ahead. Work hard with determination to realize your dreams and strive dedicatedly to build a New India. Let us collectively fulfill the aspirations of more than a billion people.

India today stands at the cusp of a tremendous demographic opportunity. 65% of India’s population is under 35 years of age. For this demographic dividend to be effectively realized, quality education with necessary skills, knowledge and creative thinking is essential to build India into a 21st century innovation hub. 

Education is not just the accumulation of knowledge from textbooks. Albert Einstein once said that education is not the learning of facts but the training of the mind to think something that cannot be learned from text books. Sometimes, asking the right questions is more important than having the right answers.

Dear students, you must not deviate from the righteous path and remain committed to upholding ethics and morals at all times. As you step out of the portals of this institution, many of you might look for employment and many others might decide to pursue further studies. Irrespective of what you intend to do, one thing is clear---opportunities are aplenty and make yourself capable of utilizing these opportunities to the fullest possible extent.

At the same time, I must remind you that the society expects a lot from today’s young generation. The scope and opportunities are unlimited. You would find a very different sense of accomplishment and contentment, when you make a difference in someone else’s life, especially if that person is not as fortunate as you. Above all, the interest of the nation must remain uppermost in your minds.

With these words, I once again congratulate the graduates who have received medals and degrees and call upon them to serve the humanity to the best of their capabilities and strive for the growth of our nation and welfare of our countrymen.

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkiah Naidu called for strengthening library movement from universities to villages and said it should become a jan andolan on the lines of Swachh Bharat and Beti Bachao, Beti Padao programmes.

Inaugurating the Centenary celebrations of Patna University Library at Patna, Bihar today, he said that libraries were temples of knowledge. For centuries India was once known as Vishwaguru and our ancient Universities were treasure houses of knowledge.

People from across the globe used to come to India to learn and enrich their knowledge.

Shri Naidu said that books were greatest sources of transmission of culture. “Books are our intellectual and cultural capital. They are parts of our intangible heritage”, he added.

The Vice President said that the habit of reading should be inculcated among students from a young age. 

Shri Naidu also advised the students to shun sedentary lifestyle and junk food. He also emphasized that one should never forget one’s mother, native place, mother tongue, motherland and the Guru, who provided knowledge and wisdom.

Shri Naidu said that libraries must become vibrant places of learning and become forums for promotion of knowledge and literary issues.

In order to retain the relevance of library in the age of Google, Shri Naidu said that it was essential to undertake digitization of libraries for easy access to students, researchers and others.

Saying that students require holistic education and skills that equip them to face the challenges of the 21st century, the Vice President urged Universities and educational institutions to change their teaching methods and curricula.

Calling upon Indian educational institutions to match international standards, the Vice President said that famous universities of ancient India such as the Magadh University have made India the ‘Vishwaguru’.

Saying that India generously shared its wisdom for the betterment of the humanity all over the world, he stressed that India never considered its knowledge as ‘Intellectual property, and shared it with larger world.”

The Vice President called upon universities and higher education institutions to strive for achieving highest standards and recapture the past glory to make India the Vishwaguru again.

Earlier, he visited the Manuscripts Section of Patna University Library and saw some of the rare and oldest manuscripts preserved there.

The Governor of Bihar, Shri Fagu Chauhan, the Chief Minister of Bihar, Shri Nitish Kumar, the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, Shri Sushil Kumar Modi, the Vice Chancellor of Patna University, Shri Rash Bihari Prasad Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for ushering a nutrition revolution in the county by creating women nutrition-warriors or change leaders at the hamlet level.

Addressing the gathering after presenting the Outlook Poshan Awards 2019 under the “Outlook Speak out-Poshan” program on nutrition, organised by Outlook India, here today, the Vice President said the change leaders must create awareness and provide counseling by visiting every home in villages and hamlets in rural areas.

Shri Naidu also called for a national movement on the lines of Swachh Bharat, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Abhiyaan and other similar schemes to eliminate the scourge of malnutrition and other nutrition-related problems.

The Vice President stressed the need for a special focus on pregnant and lactating mothers to build future potential and see a new generation of citizens endowed with maximum physical and mental potentiality.

Shri Naidu also urged media and cinema, the powerful communication tools of modern society, to create awareness on the importance of nutrition. Besides the government, the society at large also has responsibility in addressing the problem of malnutrition. “We need to change the mindset and outlook of the people”, he added.

Describing India as a young nation with 65 per cent of the people under the age of 35 years, the Vice President said that their health and wellbeing was crucial for India to fast-track progress and achieves its rightful place in the comity of nations.  He said that nutrition was essential for a healthy immune system and higher-order cognitive ability.

The Vice President said that problems such as micronutrients deficiency could be addressed by promoting naturally bio-fortified crops like minor millets, amla and drumstick. “Micronutrients deficiency results in low productivity, poor cognitive and physical development. We need to address this through supplementation, food fortification and dietary diversity,” he added.

Expressing his expressed concern that 38.4 percent of children below the age of five years were stunted in India, Shri Naidu said that empowerment of the present and future generations should be the top priority for the country.

Pointing out that hunger and obesity were the double burden of malnutrition, the Vice President called upon all stakeholders and policymakers in the health sector to immediately focus combating the problem.

Calling for building on the best practices and models to eradicate malnutrition, he said the government and development partners must come together on a common platform to work for this national cause.

The Vice President urged the corporate sector to allocate more funds under CSR for nutrition-related interventions. He also wanted Parliamentarians to utilize MPLAD funds for similar activities and suggested that MNREGA scheme could also focus on nutrition-related activities like nutri-gardens/kitchen gardens on community lands.

The Vice President observed that Indian food and diet system, with their diversity, promote good nutrition and wanted the people, particularly the youngsters to shun eating junk food. “Instant food means constant disease”, he cautioned.

Shri Naidu, while stressing the need for immunization to prevent children from falling prey to various dangerous diseases, lauded the Government’s “Mission Indradhanush"" program to improve immunization coverage.

The Editor-in-Chief, Outlook, Shri Ruben Banerjee, the CEO, Outlook, Shri Indranil Roy and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to be here at the “Outlook Speak out-Poshan” program on nutrition being organised by “Outlook India”.

India is a country built on the hopes of 1.35 billion people. In my long political career, I have had the opportunity to see the country and my fellow countrymen very closely. I can, thus, say with utmost certainty that we are a nation of the indomitable spirit and unmatchable potential to show excellence in every field.

The latest Chandrayaan-2 mission speaks volumes of our scientific fervour and technological advancements.  However, to keep India striding fast on its development trajectory, we need the people of the country -- its human capital -- to be stronger and healthier. And of course, nutrition is a key determinant in making the human capital healthier.

India is a young nation with 65 per cent of the people under the age of 35 years. No other country is blessed with such a huge demographic advantage. For India to fast-track progress and achieve its rightful place in the comity of nations, we must ensure that our people, particularly the youngsters are well nourished.   

However, it is a matter of concern that 38.4 percent of children below the age of five years are stunted in India, according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4).

Data also shows that there has been an increase in childhood wasting in the last 10 years (NFHS-3 and 4) from 19.8% to 21%. Rising Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) remain critical concerns. Besides under-nutrition, there is also the problem of over nutrition or obesity. At least 20.7% of Indian women and 18.6% of men are obese and overweight (NFHS-4). Hunger and obesity are the double burden of malnutrition.

Water scarcity, unprecedented drought, floods and climate vulnerability are affecting India’s food production posing a threat to our present and future generations.

As we all are aware, nutrition is essential for a healthy immune system and higher-order cognitive ability. Therefore, empowerment of the present and future generations should be the top priority for the country.  It is extremely crucial for inclusive and sustainable development.

Indian food and diet system, with their diversity, promote good nutrition. People, at large, believe that the Indian way is self-sustained, and it can very well support the present and future generations. These traditional Indian diets promote better nutrition, and therefore, we must promote our traditional food and feeding practices.

It has also been observed that many Indian states have done exemplary work in the field of nutrition. Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Chhattisgarh, Punjab  Mizoram, Gujarat, Odisha, Delhi and Assam have shown reduction in stunting.

Meghalaya, Mizoram, Bihar, Jharkhand and Kerala have shown success in reduction of wasting. Sikkim, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar and Jharkhand have shown success in reduction of anaemia. We need to celebrate our success and be proud to scale up this evidence and learning. These achievements can inspire others to replicate and take forward the initiatives.

Our programs and policies should be evidence-based. I would urge research and academic institutions like ICMR, CFTRI, ICAR, NIN, IITs and AIIMS to carry out more research in the area of nutrition.

It should also be noted that adolescent girls act as the second window of opportunity in the case of addressing malnutrition, while  the first 1000 days of life being the first window. Preventing early marriage of girls, addressing girl-dropout from schools, delaying first pregnancy and adequate spacing between births would greatly contribute to better nutrition.

We also need to involve Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Health and Family Welfare and Food and Civil Supplies Ministries in Nutrition planning. Ideally, we should overlay Nutrition maps with agricultural maps on what produce should be able to achieve optimal nutrition and recommend seed kits. Promoting dry land agriculture will be a game changer on the nutrition front.

Initiation of breastfeeding within an hour of birth is extremely important and prevents neonatal morbidity/mortality. It helps build continued immunity after placental separation. Exclusive breastfeeding needs to be ensured up to six months. In India, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding is only 55% (NFHS–4) and only 41% are able to start breastfeeding within an hour of giving birth to a newborn. Breastfeeding needs to continue up to 2 years. It is pertinent to mention that we are observing “World Breastfeeding Week” from August 1 to 7th.  We need to actively promote the breastfeeding to ensure optimal nutrition and reduce disease risk among infants.

Dear sisters and brothers, the reach of ICDS cannot be matched by any other system. We need to ensure that ICDS serves right complementary food for children below 2 years and supplementary food for Pregnant and Lactating Women.

It is also equally important to address micronutrient malnutrition in the country through supplementation, food fortification, bio-fortification and conventional plant breeding. Dietary diversification needs to be ensured with increased consumption of green leafy vegetables, fruits, lentils and other protein rich food items.

Immunization is essential to prevent children from falling prey to various dangerous diseases. I am glad that the government has launched ""Mission Indradhanush"" to vastly improve immunization coverage.

By continuing our efforts to ensure safe motherhood through schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Matritva Suraksha Abhiyaan and Ayushman Bharat, we also need to focus on ensuring good quality, easily accessible and affordable maternal healthcare services for all women.

Since nutrition is closely linked with agricultural sector, we need to promote nutrition-sensitive agriculture, dry land agriculture and naturally bio-fortified crops like minor millets, amla and drumstick.

It is about time India focused on Precision Agriculture using Artificial Intelligence for food, nutrition and water security.

Micronutrient deficiencies, which are commonly known as deficiencies of vitamins and minerals, i.e. below healthy thresholds, are a major public-health problem in India today. They affect all the income groups across all states.

Micronutrients deficiency results in low productivity, poor cognitive and physical development. We need to address this through supplementation, food fortification and dietary diversity.

I also feel that State Food Commissions should be designated as State Food and Nutrition Commissions and empowered to review, monitor and ensure access to nutritious food.

Apart from establishing a system to generate and review nutrition data and the status of interventions in multiple sectors, there is a need to focus on effective implementation of proven interventions. Anganwadi centers should be the points of convergence for nutrition, health and food security services.

I feel that there is also a need to leverage the human capital potential -- 5.5 million Self-Help Groups, with 60 million women members, 76,000 village-level dairy co-operatives, 2,50,000 panchayats across 640,867, Villages, 13.63 lakh Aanganwadi centres, 1.4 million Workers and 1.4 million Helpers. Also, ASHA workers and ANMs should work together for the success of the mission to make India malnutrition-free.

These grass-root level workers must be imparted training and empowered with adequate budget.

The Pradhan Mantri POSHAN Abhiyaan – the scheme for holistic nourishment-- can be the guiding light for all the nutrition-related interventions in the country. It aims to benefit 100 million people in three phases from 2017-18 to 2019-20.It targets the reduction of stunting, under-nutrition, anaemia and low birth weight.

I feel that POSHAN Abhiyaan needs to be implemented in a campaign mode with greater involvement of panchayats, civil society organizations and people’s networks.

In fact, there should be a national movement on the lines of Swachh Bharat, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Abhiyaan and other similar schemes to eliminate the scourge of malnutrition and other nutrition-related problems.

I also feel that there is a need to bring about a nutrition revolution in the county by creating women nutrition-warriors or change leaders at the hamlet level. These change leaders need to create awareness and provide counselling by visiting every home.

Dear sisters and brothers, India is definitely ready for the nutrition revolution to address malnutrition and it has to be led by women.

All stakeholders and policy makers in the health sector need to immediately focus on the problem of rising obesity. Let us address India’s double burden on malnutrition.

Finally in my concluding remarks, I would like to stress that every child has a right to receive good nutrition. It is necessary to address malnutrition in all forms and in a life-cycle approach with a focus on first 1000 days of life.

We need to build on the numerous best practices, evidence and models to eradicate malnutrition. Special focus should be on pregnant and lactating mothers to build future potential and see a new generation of citizens endowed with maximum physical and mental potentiality.

The government and development partners need to come together on a common platform and work for this national cause. Greater allocation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds must go for nutrition-related interventions.

Parliamentarians should also utilize their MPLAD funds towards nutrition. MGNREGA scheme could also possibly focus on nutrition-related activities by promoting nutri-gardens/kitchen gardens on community lands.

I must compliment Outlook Group and PCI for coming together to bring people’s attention to this pertinent national issue. Good nutrition is not a choice anymore; it is a prerequisite for New India’s brighter future!

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said the enactment of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was one of the success stories of Indian economic reforms and that it played a critical role in reshaping the behaviour of borrowers.

Speaking after inaugurating the Insolvency Research Foundation (IRF), here today, the Vice President said that Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has helped set the stage for superior renegotiation between the lenders and borrowers.

Quoting a report by Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), the Vice President said that “Since 1 December 2016, nearly 1500 Corporate Debts have been brought before CIRP and 142 have already been closed, while 63 have been withdrawn. As many as 302 cases have ended in liquidation, while the resolution plans have been approved in 72 cases.

Asserting that an efficient insolvency law was vital to stability in financial systems and fundamental to economic growth and wealth creation, the Vice President said that a sound insolvency and bankruptcy process would enable rapid resolutions for problems or risks posed by entrepreneurship.

“Without a bankruptcy law, if an organization defaults on a loan, each claimant races to grab its share of the organization's assets. This battle among the claimants can push the organization into liquidation regardless of whether it has a generally stable business model,” he said.

Saying that the essence of the insolvency process was to aid against such challenges and encourage entrepreneurship, business, and more risk-taking, the Vice President said that it was, therefore, crucial to continue to invest in the development of the law by studying its impact, and investigate its strengths and weaknesses on a regular basis.

Shri Naidu said that academics play a very important role in supporting policy development, industry research and finding innovative solutions in advanced countries and called for a similar and a more robust collaboration between academia and industry in improving the culture of research in India, especially in matters relating to insolvency and bankruptcy.

The Vice President appreciated the government for initiating a series of economic reforms to improve the investment climate in diverse areas and make India an attractive destination. The reforms have added a new dimension to the development story of India.

The Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri Anurag Thakur, the former Judge, Supreme Court of India and Chairperson, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, Shri S.J. Mukhopadyay, the Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Shri Injeti Srinivas, the Chairperson, IBBI, Dr. M.S. Sahoo, the DG CEO, IICA, Dr. Sameer Sharma and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to inaugurate the Insolvency Research Foundation (IRF). I would like to thank the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) and Society for Insolvency Practitioners of India (SIPI) for having invited me.

Before sharing my thoughts on the need for such a foundation in India’s insolvency chapter, I would also like to compliment Dr. Sameer Sharma for building a culture of research at IICA.

As you all are aware, an efficient insolvency law is vital to stability in financial systems and fundamental to economic growth and wealth creation. Entrepreneurship, by nature, involves risk taking. Some business ideas will inevitably turn out badly. This may be due to several reasons. A sound insolvency and bankruptcy process enable rapid resolutions of such problems.

Without a bankruptcy law, if an organization defaults on a loan, each claimant races to grab its share of the organization's assets. This battle among the claimants can push the organization into liquidation regardless of whether it has a generally stable business model.

The essence of the insolvency process is to aid against such challenges and encourage entrepreneurship, business and more risk-taking. It is, therefore, crucial to continue to invest in the development of the law by studying its impact, and investigate its strengths and weaknesses on a regular basis.

In advanced countries, academics play a very important role in supporting policy development, industry research and finding innovative solutions. I would like to see a similar and a more robust collaboration between academia and industry in improving the culture of research in India, especially in matters relating insolvency and bankruptcy

Dear Sisters and Brothers, the government has initiated a series of economic reforms to improve the investment climate in diverse areas and make India an attractive destination. As you all are aware, India has jumped by several ranks in the ease of doing business and stands at 77th position.

Of course, we need to further improve the ranking and make India one of the prime global destinations for investors.  

Since the establishment of a robust insolvency framework with the enactment of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in 2016, we have made rapid strides in a short time. Undoubtedly, it is one of the success stories of the recent Indian economic reforms.

It has been more than two years since the provisions relating to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) came into force on 1 December, 2016. According to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) report, nearly 1500 Corporate Debts have been brought before CIRP as of December, 2018. Of these, 142 have been closed, while 63 have been withdrawn. As many as 302 cases have ended in liquidation, while the resolution plans have been approved in 72 cases.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is also playing a critical role in reshaping the incentives and behaviour of borrowers. The IBC has helped set the stage for superior renegotiation between the lenders and the borrowers. 

Firms that are undergoing financial distress are not likely to increase labour or capital. The exit of such firms will rather free labour and capital. In other words, the bankruptcy procedures will ultimately aid in recycling resources for healthy firms and a healthier economy.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is providing invaluable gains which are not visible to the public eye. Therefore, the gains for India that are attributable to reforms are understated. An example of this is the idea of subordinate legislation.

An efficient procedure of utilizing information to improve the working of the insolvency and bankruptcy regime is essential. A research driven regulation making process requires a statistical framework and I believe IRF can be the building block for a more robust regime.

I am told that so far 1,322 cases have been admitted by the National Company Law Tribunal and 4,452 cases have been disposed at the pre-admission stage, while 66 have been resolved after adjudication and another 260 cases have been ordered for liquidation.

I have also been informed that the realization by creditors has been around Rs. 80,000 crores from 66 resolution cases. In regard to 4452 cases disposed at the pre-admission stage, the amount settled was close to Rs 2.02 lakh crores. I am also aware that some big cases are in advanced stages of resolution and the realization from these is expected to be around Rs 70,000 crores.

Also the decline in new accounts coming under NPA category shows a definite improvement in the lending and borrowing behaviour. This is a clear evidence of the positive impact of IBC on the financial market. I am glad to note that through the commitment of the current government, a vast industry of Insolvency Professionals has developed in India.

Dear sisters and brothers, Insolvency is a dynamic law and needs constant evolution. Rapid changes are required in the law to keep pace with market developments.

I am happy to note that the Insolvency Research Foundation (IRF) has been established by the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) in partnership with SIPI, an insolvency think tank, as an independent research center to serve the public good and help in robust policy-making.

I am sure that its activities will lead to the emergence of a cadre of scholars and a robust network of academics, scholars, and jurists in the area of insolvency.

I am aware that the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) has supported the initiatives of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in key matters relating to Corporate Affairs and governance. It is promoting research, building capacities and advocating policies in the area of Corporate Governance, Competition Law, Investor education, Insolvency & Bankruptcy and Corporate Social Responsibility, among others.

 It is a delight to learn that it is the sole Institution in the country authorized by Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) to run its flagship Graduate Insolvency Programme (GIP). IICA has gathered the best minds in India and from abroad to deliver this programme.

Society of Insolvency Practitioners of India, in short SIPI is the first independent think tank dedicated to the cause of insolvency and development of soft infrastructure of insolvency industry.

The efforts of the government in bringing the much-needed legal reforms is re-defining India’s growth story. Thus, to conclude, the insolvency and bankruptcy reforms have yielded valuable gains in the conduct of borrowers, both towards operational and financial creditors. The way forward lies in building data sets and high-quality policy teams, which will carry this work program forward on various fronts.

I would like IRF to provide support by emulating global best practices and adapting them to make relevant in the Indian context. I also call upon the industry to support research as part of their corporate social responsibility. 

My best wishes to IRF. I hope to see it emerge as India’s flagship research center and make a mark as  a centre of global  excellence.

I once again take this opportunity to congratulate IRF, IICA and SIPI and convey my best wishes for their future endeavours.

Thank you.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has expressed concern over the rising levels of irritation, intolerance and impatience in the world and called for more soothing voices that inspire tranquility, inner peace and joy.

He was addressing the gathering at ‘Samvaad with Sadhguru’, a discourse by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, at the Uparashtrapati Bhawan, here today.

The Vice President opined that mechanical lifestyle and high pressure work routines are making our lives stressful. He also expressed concern that anger and hatred are discolouring discourses across the world today. ‘This does not bode well for our progress’, he said.

Shri Naidu spoke of the need for inner peace, tranquil minds and joyful hearts and called on all spiritual leaders to interact more frequently with people and give them spiritual advice and guidance for improving the quality of lives.

The Vice President said that Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev had the rare ability to explain complex concepts easily. ‘He is a guru who reaches out to the people with the message of hope, of peace and positive thinking’, he added. 

Shri Naidu said that for most of us who are only used to ‘vaad’ and ‘vivaad’, a ‘samvaad’ would be a refreshing change. He expressed hope that the ‘samvaad’ would lead us a little closer to the ‘sadasad viveka’ or the ability and the wisdom to separate ‘sad’ from ‘asad’, the ‘good’ from the ‘not good’.

The Vice President appreciated Sadhguru’s discourse on happiness, positivity and wellbeing and applauded his ‘Rally for Rivers’ initiative for water conservation.

The Speaker of Lok Sabha, Shri Om Birla, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy, the Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri V. Muraleedharan, the Deputy Chairman, Rajya Sabha, Shri Harivansh, Justice N.V. Ramana, Judge, Supreme Court, Justice L. Nageswara Rao, Judge, Supreme Court, Justice R. Subhash, Judge, Supreme Court, Shri A. Surya Prakash, Chairman Prasar Bharathi several secretaries to the government and prominent educationist, Shri J.S. Rajput and others were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“Let me welcome you to this morning’s Samvad with Sadguru.  Today’s world is a troubled world.  The mechanical lifestyles with high pressure work routines are making most of our lives quite stressful.  The levels of irritation, intolerance and impatience are rising.  Anger and hatred are discolouring our discourses. This does not bode well for humanity’s progress.  We need to calm down and start adding ‘life’ to our years.  It is not enough if we merely add years to our life.  We need inner peace, tranquil minds and joyful hearts. We need solace, we need a soothing voice that refreshes and rejuvenates us. One such voice is the voice of Sadguru. We are fortunate to have him with us today morning.

He is one of those remarkable modern day sages who connects us with our spiritual heritage. He has the rare ability to explain complex concepts easily. He has the gift of connecting effortlessly with the audiences across the world. He is a guru who reaches out to the people with the message of hope, of peace and positive thinking.  In fact, I feel that all the spiritual leaders, pitadhipathies and mathadhipathies should move more actively among people, mingle with them and give practical spiritual advice and guidance to them in order to improve the quality of their lives. We need gurus who reach out to common people and communicate with them in a language easily understood by all and guide them. Sadguru has been taking this up as his mission over many years now. 

Today we are privileged to have him amidst us and hear him speak with all of us. For most of us who are only used to vaad and vivaad, we thought having a samvaad would be a refreshing change. We are grateful to Sadguru for agreeing to lead this short Samvadtoday. This samvaadwith Sadguru promises to be a dialogue which, I am sure, will lead us a little closer to the “Sadasad Viveka” or the ability and the wisdom to separate  ‘Sad’ from ‘Asad’, or identifying what is ‘good’ and what is not good.

I now request Sadguruji to kindly address us.

Thak you, Jaihind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon Forest Officers across the country to equip themselves with the knowledge and skills to deal with challenges thrown up by climate change and loss of biodiversity. He said the traditional role of foresters was changing radically and they are now entrusted not only with the sustainable management of forests but also educate people, who were dependent on forests.

Interacting with the Officer Trainees of the 2018 Batch of Indian Forest Service at Upa Rashtrapati Bhawan, here today, the Vice President said that India must become a world leader in addressing climate change and biodiversity loss and create a model for other nations to follow.

Shri Naidu stressed the need to educate and encourage people on forest conservation and protection. “There is very little scope to expand forest cover given the growing population, it is time that we conserve, preserve and protect them,” he added.

Describing the Forest officers as the custodians of forests, Shri Naidu said that it was their mandate to implement the National Forest Policy and ensure the ecological stability of the country through the protection and participatory, sustainable management of natural resources.

Urging foresters to play a vital role in striking a fine balance between development and environmental conservation, he said “this balance is necessary for the inclusive and sustainable development of a fast-growing nation like India.”

Pointing out that a number of species of flora and fauna were now facing the threat of extinction due to habitat loss and fragmentation and reckless exploitation, the Vice President cautioned that loss of biodiversity might trigger large and unpredictable changes in the ecosystem that could adversely impact all life on earth.

The Vice President also asked them to place special emphasis on preserving the forests of the North-Eastern region of India which has been consistently losing tree cover over the last 18 years.

The Director, IGNFA, Shri Omkar Singh, the Director General of Forests, Shri Siddhanta Das and other dignitaries are also seen.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It is indeed a matter of great pleasure for me to be amongst the officer Trainees of the 2018 batch of Indian Forest Service. I am also extremely happy that we have two young Officer Trainees from Bhutan here with us today. 

I welcome you all to Upa Rashtrapati Bhawan! 

Forestry has always held a very special place in Indian ethos and culture. For us, forests are not merely resources. They represent much more. They are the cultural, spiritual and intellectual heritage of the country.

The task of protecting our natural forests falls upon the Indian Forest Service, one of the three All India Services constituted under the All India Service Act, 1951.

You have been given with the mandate of implementing the National Forest Policy, in order to ensure the ecological stability of the country, through the protection and participatory, sustainable management of natural resources. 

It is a noble task, it is a prestigious task and above all it is an onerous task.

 I take this occasion, to congratulate each and every one of you for choosing this profession. 

Today, the traditional role of forester has changed radically. He/she is entrusted not only with the sustainable management of forests but also empowerment of the people, who depend on forests. 

As the custodians of our national treasure, you have a vital role to play in striking a fine balance between development and environmental conservation. This balance is necessary for the inclusive and sustainable development of a fast growing nation like India.

My dear young officers,

You have the mandate of protecting and nurturing the biodiversity of one of the 17 mega-biodiverse countries of the world.

India accounts for 7-8 percent of the world’s recorded species. The way we manage our natural resources plays a decisive role, not only in protecting our biodiversity but also global biodiversity.

Each region, each ecological area throws a different challenge and as young forestry officers, you should equip yourselves with the knowledge and skills to deal with these challenges.

The National Forest Policy aims to our tree cover from 23% to 33%. In order to achieve the target, we will have to give a huge thrust to the afforestation programmes in our country. 

I also ask you to place special emphasis on preserving the forests of the North Eastern region of India which has been consistently losing tree cover over the last 18 years.

My dear young friends,

A number of species of flora and fauna are now facing the threat of extinction due to habitat loss and fragmentation and reckless exploitation. Loss of biodiversity may trigger large, unpredictable and disastrous changes in the ecosystem that will adversely impact all life on earth.

At least 10 per cent of India's recorded wild flora and some of its wild fauna are on the list of threatened species. We cannot let this continue. Biodiversity is a vital resource that needs to be assiduously conserved as it holds the key to life itself. 

The fragile eco-systems such as coastal areas, hills and mountains, wetlands, deserts, shifting cultivation areas need to be conserved in order to sustain the livelihood of a large number of people, apart from ecological benefits they bring.

Over the last few decades, the world has woken up to the threats to the very survival of mankind due to environmental degradation, depletion in forest cover and climate change.

Forests, being one of the most effective carbon sinks, may be the most potent way to reduce the rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the consequent threat of global warming.

India is a key player in the world in addressing climate change and biodiversity loss and it is one of the big countries in the world in terms of population and economy. 

So, India must become a world leader in addressing climate change and biodiversity loss and create a model for other nations to follow. 

We have already made significant progress towards conservation goals. The results of the tiger census released recently, which estimated that the number of tigers in India has increased from 1411 in 2006 to 2,976 in 2018, are indeed heartening. 

This accomplishment is an eloquent testimony to the skill, commitment, capability and dedication of our foresters.  

Being a Forester, your task is not easy one. The challenges before you are complex and the expectations from you will always be very high.

Mahatma Gandhi said, “What we are doing to the Forests of the World is but the mirror reflection of what we are doing to ourselves and one another”.

Let this talisman of the Father of the Nation guide your words and deeds as you advance in your career.

I wish you all the very best in your future endeavours. 

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

                Expressing concern over India's slide from the heights of Nalanda and Takshasila to not being among the world's top 100 educational institutions now, the Vice President of India and Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the New Educational Policy will make India a global educational hub. He urged the public to give their views and suggestions on the draft NEP by the stipulated time of 15th of this month.

Shri Naidu further called for a holistic and value-based education that will lay strong foundations for the vibrant economy that India is emerging as. He spoke on the challenges to Indian education after releasing a book 'The Dynamics of Indian Education' authored by Prof. J.S. Rajput at the Vice President's residence, here today.

The Vice President said; ""These are the critical times for the country and there is a need for having a fresh look at the education system. I have been consistently advocating the need for revamping the education system to not only make our universities world-class, but to make India the knowledge hub. I am glad that the draft of the New Education Policy makes several out of the box suggestions that have the potential to turn India into a global education hub.""

Shri Naidu stressed that primary education shall be in the mother tongue which enables learning other languages effectively at later stages. Highlighting the knowledge traditions of India, he referred to several German Universities promoting Sanskrit to decipher ancient palm leaves and scriptures for clues for scientific innovation.

Former Union Minister Shri Arif Mohammad Khan who spoke on the occasion said that the land of India for ages is marked by the tradition of knowledge and wisdom. He referred to Prophet Mohammad as having said; ""Sitting in Mecca, I am feeling the cool breeze of Knowledge from India. I am an Arab without Arabness; I am not an Indian but feel the Indianness.""

Prof. Rajput, former Secretary-General of Lok Sabha, Shri Subhash Kashyap and Chairman of Prasar Bharti, Shri A. Surya Prakash spoke on various aspects of Indian Education. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

“I am immensely pleased to release the book “The Dynamics of Indian Education” written by well-known educationist, Prof Rajput.  

The book covers a whole gamut of issues relating to Indian education system and I must compliment the author for this timely work on a topic that is very close to my heart.

As we all are aware, India has a rich history, tradition and culture of education system from Vedic times. The Gurukul system of imparting knowledge and skills used to focus on holistic development of individuals. Education of women was also accorded huge importance during ancient times and there were well-known women scholars during the Vedic period.

In fact, India was once known as Vishwaguru because of its world class centres of learning like Takshashila, Pushpagiri, Nalanda and others. It was stated that around 10,000 students, including many from foreign shores used to study diverse subjects at Takshashila.

India contributed not only in philosophy and spirituality, but in sciences, mathematics, astronomy and other areas. The objective was “welfare of one and all – Sarva Bhut Hite Ratah”

Subsequently, following foreign invasions and the colonial rule, India lost its pre-eminent position. Today, one finds that not a single Indian university figures in the top-ranking global educational institutions.

These are the critical times for the country and there is a need for having a fresh look at the education system. I have been consistently advocating the need for revamping the education system to not only make our universities world class, but to make India the knowledge and innovation hub.

We need to recapture the past glory. Our education system must remain deeply rooted to culture, while simultaneously steadfastly pursuing new frontiers of knowledge.

Undoubtedly, our post-Independence achievements in education are praiseworthy. We have near total enrolment in schools in spite of over-threefold increase in population!

The recent launch of Chandrayaan -2 and other remarkable achievements in space sciences have unveiled before the world the Indian tradition for the quest of knowledge. It inspires and motivates young Indians and our scientists deserve all the praise for making us proud. Elsewhere, Indians working at NASA and Silicon Valley have made the country proud with their contributions.

I feel that the need of the hour is to provide quality education at all levels to all people. I am glad that the draft of the New Education Policy makes several out-of-box suggestions that have the potential to turn India into a Global education Hub. With the draft report placed for another round of receiving inputs, I hope that many more suggestions would come forth to make Indian universities achieve their rightful place in the global rankings.

I must however, mention that in our march towards a knowledge society, we need to strengthen our school education on priority basis. In particular, special attention has to be bestowed to improve government schools.

We must reform the education system to do away with rote learning. We need to promote concept learning, critical thinking, creativity, problem solving skills as also multilingualism and digital literacy to enable the students to confidently face challenges and successfully pursue their careers.

I need not once again enumerate the importance of teaching in mother tongue from a young age. In fact, I have consistently been advocating the need to make it mandatory for mother tongue to be the medium of instruction up to primary level. 

I am told that some of the top universities in Germany teach Sanskrit to enable the scholars of the subject decipher ancient palm leafs and scriptures and find clues for scientific innovation. We should not neglect Sanskrit. I feel that no language should be imposed, nor any language opposed.

Teachers are the pivot of national educational endeavors. We need best of the minds in teaching profession. Once in the profession they need to internalize “yavadjeevait adhiyate viprah” – the wise continue to gain knowledge throughout life. 

Teachers should be torchbearers of the society. I am told that there are around 1 crore teachers and 30 crore students from KG to PG level in the country. Filling up all the vacant positions of teachers is equally important to make our education effective.

Teachers play the most crucial role in shaping the character of a child after his or her parents. Therefore, teachers should have societal concerns. We must develop a model of education that reflects Indian culture and ethos. We need to inculcate cultural, moral, ethical and spiritual values among children. 

I hope the new educational policy will address various concerns on reforming the system and fulfill the need for India-centric education architecture. The draft policy should be studied with an open mind. People should give constructive suggestions rather than criticize it for the sake of criticism.

We need education for progress and development. Probably more than that, we need Education for Character Development. Value based education that prepares the young for an India that abounds in ‘social cohesion and religious amity’ is our goal.

The book practically covers all the aspects mentioned by me. Prof. Rajput strongly pleads for value education, character formation and celebration of unity in diversity. I wish him well in his efforts.

 

Thank you, Jaihind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has hailed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, passed in the Rajya Sabha the other day, and said that it was aimed at securing gender rights and justice to women.

The Vice President said that the passing of the Bill was a great moment in India’s legislative history. “It is a major social reform bill that will go a long way in ensuring justice to Muslim women”, he added.

Speaking at the Diamond Jubilee Celebrations of Janki Devi Memorial College in New Delhi, Shri Naidu said this was long overdue for a country that has taken great pride in its deep-rooted principles of democracy, secularism and equality.

The Vice President stressed that investing in women’s capabilities and empowering them were important for propelling economic growth and overall development.  He observed that women’s education has been found to have a more significant effect on lowering poverty and promotion of sustainable development.

Pointing out that women’s literacy was more than just about economic opportunities, the Vice President said that increasing knowledge and awareness among women would have a huge, positive impact on the society.

Shri Naidu said that a country like India could not neglect the importance of education and the empowerment of the women, especially when it was aspiring to be a 5 trillion-dollar economy and striving to acquire a position of leadership in the world.

Quoting the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report, Shri Naidu said that raising women's labour force participation to that of men could boost GDP by as much as 27 percent in India.  “If 50% of skilled women could join the workforce, India can scale its growth by 1.5 percentage points to 9% a year. India needs its women to contribute to the workforce,” he added.

Opining that empowerment of women would enable them to respond to the challenges, improve their status within the family and participate in the decision making, the Vice President said that a happy family and a healthy and robust society could not be sustained without the active participation of women.

Observing that education was the foundation, on which the progress of a nation depends, the Vice President stressed the need to provide good quality and affordable education to our young people. He said education would help India convert its demographic dividend to achieve all-round and inclusive development of the nation.

Shri Naidu called upon the universities and schools to strive to become the centres of excellence where knowledge was imparted, skills were honed, character was built, curiosity was inspired and morals were fortified.

To achieve this, the Vice President said that there was an urgent need to reorient the education system. He said that India ‘simply cannot harbour an obsolete an educational system that promotes mediocrity, rote learning, stifles creativity and pulls us backwards instead of propelling us forward into the future.’

Shri Naidu wanted educational institutions to shun the status quo and embrace change in accordance with the changing times and constantly and objectively evaluate the curricula, teaching methodologies and upgrade research facilities.

Opining that education does not, by itself could make a person employable, the Vice President asserted that educational institutions must impart essential skills to students, including crucial life skills required for the knowledge-driven, interconnected world of the 21st century.

Shri Naidu appreciated the institute’s initiatives such as the rainwater harvesting system and Equal Opportunities Cell to support economically challenged students.

The Vice Chancellor of Delhi University, Prof, Yogesh Tyagi, the Chairman of the Governing Body, Janki Devi Memorial College, Prof. Brajesh Choudhary, Principal, Janki Devi Memorial College, Dr. Swati Pal, faculty members and students of the college were present.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“जानकी देवी स्मृति कॉलेज के संस्थापक दिवस के इस अविस्मरणीय अवसर पर आप सभी विद्यार्थियों, शिक्षकों, कॉलेज प्रशासन तथा गणमान्य अतिथियों के साथ सम्मिलित हो कर, इस कॉलेज के हीरक जयंती समारोह का उद्घाटन करते हुए, अत्यंत हर्ष का अनुभव कर रहा हूं।

मुझे यह जान कर प्रसन्नता है कि जानकी देवी स्मृति कॉलेज का उद्देश्य ही बालिकाओं को अच्छी शिक्षा प्रदान कर,उन्हें आर्थिक रूप से स्वावलंबी बनाना है जिससे वे समाज और वृहत्तर विश्व के उत्थान में सार्थक योगदान कर सकें।

इस महाविद्यालय के संस्थापक श्री बृज कृष्ण चंदीवाला जी, जिन्हें स्नेहपूर्वक भाई जी भी कहते थे, एक दूरदृष्टा थे।गांधीवादी विचारधारा से प्रभावित, यह उन्हीं की दृष्टि थी कि बेटियों को विशेषकर दुर्बल वर्ग की बेटियों को अच्छी शिक्षा प्रदान की जाए।

It gives me immense pleasure to participate in the Founder’s Day event and inaugurate the Diamond Jubilee Celebrations of Janki Devi Memorial College. It is a momentous occasion for the college, its students, faculty, management and all others involved in the running of this institution.

I am glad to learn that Janki Devi Memorial College aspires to provide quality education to young women, to empower them to be economically self-reliant and contribute meaningfully to progress of the society and the world at large.

The founder of the College, Shri Brij Krishan Chandiwala or Bhaiji, as he was fondly called, was a profound visionary. His vision to empower girls, especially from the marginalized sections of society, through quality education, reveals not just his deep commitment to Gandhian principles but also his foresight.

He chose the trading area close to Karol Bagh to set up a college for women because he felt that women from the trading class lacked access to quality education. He was convinced that education for the elite was easily accessible and the more daunting challenge was to provide quality, affordable education to the underprivileged and economically backward classes.

I am glad to know that, today, JDMC is one of the most prominent colleges of Delhi University. I am happy to learn that JDMC has excellent facilities that provide a holistic environment for its students to pursue academic and extra-curricular interests.

The students of this college, many of whom, I believe, come from humble backgrounds, have gone on to make their mark in various fields and contributed meaningfully to the nation.

The institution has, thus, succeeded in its mission of providing quality education to students for six decades.

मुझे विशेष प्रसन्नता है कि इस महाविद्यालय का महिला विकास केन्द्र, एनसीसी, एनएसएस, तथा गांधी स्टडी सर्किल सामाजिक, सामुदायिक मुद्दों जैसे कानूनी शिक्षा,महिला स्वास्थ्य और सशक्तिकरण, प्रौढ़ शिक्षा आदि पर छात्राओं को प्रशिक्षित करते हैं जिससे उनमें सामाजिक जागृति का विकास हो।

मुझे यह भी बताया गया है कि आर्थिक रूप से दुर्बल छात्रों की हर प्रकार से मदद करने के लिए महाविद्यालय में equal opportunity cell स्थापित किया गया है, जिसके तहत निःशुल्क भोजन भी उपलब्ध कराया जाता है। दिव्यांग छात्राओं की विशेष आवश्यकताओं को पूरा करने के लिए भी अनुकूल परिवेश उपलब्ध कराने

के लिए मैं जानकी देवी मेमोरियल कॉलेज की सराहना करता हूं। सर्वसमावेशी शिक्षा प्रदान करने की दिशा में आपके निष्ठा पूर्ण प्रयास अभिनंदनीय और अनुकरणीय हैं।

 

पर्यावरण संरक्षण के लिए विशेष कार्यक्रम के माध्यम से पर्यावरण के प्रति जागरूकता पैदा की जा रही है। महाविद्यालय में स्थित जल संरक्षण प्रणाली की गणना सेंटर फॉर साइंस एंड एन्वायरमेंट द्वारा, दिल्ली के बेहतरीन उदाहरणों में की गई है। यह जरूरी है कि ऐसे प्रयासों के माध्यम से युवा विद्यार्थियों मैं पर्यावरण के प्रति जागरूकता बढ़ाई जाए।

I am glad to note that the Women's Development Centre, National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) and the Gandhi Study Circle of the college provide an opportunity for students to engage with social issues like legal literacy, women's health and empowerment and adult education.

I am told that the college has an Equal Opportunities Cell to support economically challenged students through several measures, including free meals. I also commend JDMC for creating a built environment that caters to the specific needs of the differently-abled students. I applaud your commitment towards inclusive education.

I also compliment the college for its culture of promoting eco-friendly initiatives through an active environment programme.

It is indeed noteworthy that the rain water harvesting system of the college has been rated as one of the best in Delhi by the Centre for Science and Environment. It is crucial that we instill an environmental consciousness in young people through such initiatives.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Education is a cause that is very close to my heart. In the two years that I have been in office, I have toured all over the nation meeting and interacting with students and educators.

According to Swami Vivekananda, “Education means that process by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, and intellect is sharpened, as a result of which one can stand on one’s own feet”

Education is the foundation on which the progress of a nation depends. Today, India stands at the brink of a demographic dividend as 65% of its population is below 35 years. This is an unprecedented opportunity for the country to fast track development.

The only way to convert this dividend for achieving all-round and inclusive development of the nation is to provide good quality and affordable education to our young people.

Our schools and universities must be centres of excellence where knowledge is imparted, skills are honed, character is built, curiosity is inspired and morals are fortified. However, the need of the hour is to reorient our education system.

We simply cannot harbour an obsolete educational system that promotes mediocrity, rote learning, stifles creativity and pulls us backwards instead of propelling us forward into the future.

Our educational institutions must shun status quo and embrace change in accordance with the changing times. We have to constantly and objectively evaluate our curricula, teaching methodologies and research facilities. We need to keep updating and upgrading.

We must also realize that education does not, by itself make a person employable. Educational institutions must impart essential skills to students, including crucial life skills required for the knowledge-driven, interconnected world of the 21st century.

Schools and colleges must ensure that the children and youth of our country acquire the knowledge and skills that will enable them to become active contributors to building a new India and a new world.

They must ensure that the foundations are strong. What we need is the ability to observe and absorb, to assimilate and articulate, to ask questions and seek answers, to decipher and discover. It is also of paramount importance that our children must be equipped with a ‘moral compass’ to ensure that they never deviate from the righteous path.

The Kothari Commission observes that “the greatness of a country does not depend on the extent of its territory, the length of its communication or the amount of its wealth, but on the love for higher values of life. All must develop thought for the poor and suffering, regard and respect for women, faith in brotherhood regardless of race, colour, religion etc”.

Our educational institutions must promote equality and social justice and reduce social and cultural differences through the spread of knowledge.

We must also realize that in this age of scientific knowledge and technological advancement, there is no room for superstition and blind faith. Inculcating a scientific temper among children from a young age is of vital importance to spawn a culture of research and innovation in the country.

My dear young friends,

I have also been a strong of advocate of women’s empowerment and the need to educate the girl child.

I strongly believe that investing in women’s capabilities and empowering them are important for propelling economic growth and overall development.  ‘Education for All’ has been a priority policy of successive governments. We have made significant strides in education in the seven decades since independence.

Our literacy rate which was 12% in 1947 grew to 74.04% in 2011.

Unfortunately, the gap between male and female literacy rate is considerable. According to the 2011 census, literacy rate for men was 82.14 % whereas for women it was 65.46 %.

Though this gap is narrowing, with more women becoming literate than men since 2011, we still have a long way to go.

As India aspires to be a 5 trillion-dollar economy and dreams of acquiring a position of leadership in the world, it simply cannot neglect the importance of education and the empowerment of the women.

Women constitute about 50 % of India’s human resource. The International Monitory Fund (IMF) recently estimated that raising women's labour force participation to that of men can boost GDP by as much as 27 per cent in India.  If 50% of skilled women could join the work force, India can scale its growth by 1.5 percentage points to 9 % a year. India needs its women to contribute to the work force.

Empowerment of women enables them to respond to the challenges, improve their status within the family and participate in the decision making. Today a happy family and a healthy and robust society cannot be sustained without the active participation of women.

The Government of the day too accords great priority to women empowerment. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, passed in the Parliament the other day is aimed at securing gender rights and justice to women.

The passing of the bill is indeed a great moment in India’s legislative history. It is a major social reform bill that will go a long way in ensuring justice to Muslim women. I compliment all MPs for passing this crucial bill.

This was long overdue for a country that has taken great pride in its deep-rooted principles of democracy, secularism and equality.

Women’s literacy is more than just about economic opportunities. Increasing knowledge and awareness among women has a huge positive impact on the society. For example, literacy is directly related to health and infant mortality. Kerala has the highest female literacy rate and the lowest infant mortality whereas states like Bihar and UP with low female literacy have high infant mortality rates.

ये देखा गया है कि महिला शिक्षा का गरीबी उन्मूलन और स्थायी विकास पर अधिक गहरा और सकारात्मक प्रभाव पड़ता है।

मैं आशा करता हूं कि जानकी देवी मेमोरियल कॉलेज की तरह और भी संस्थान आगे आएं और हमारी बेटियां को गुणवत्तापूर्ण शिक्षा के अधिकाधिक अवसर उपलब्ध कराएं।

मैं एक बार पुनः जानकी देवी मेमोरियल कॉलेज को इस महत्वपूर्ण उपलब्धि के लिए बधाई देता हूं और आपके भावी प्रयासों की सफलता के लिए शुभकामनाएं देता हूं।

Women’s education has been found to have a more significant effect on lowering the poverty line and promotion of sustainable development.

Many more institutions such as the JDMC should come up and create avenues of education for our girl children.

I once again congratulate JDMC for achieving this coveted milestone. I wish each and every one of you the very best in your future endeavours.

Thank You!

Jai Hind!

                My cabinet colleague Mr. Shripad Yesso Naik on the stage, all the awardees, Professionals, Officers, Ladies and Gentlemen associated with AYUSH sector!

Coming to a program related to AYUSH and Yoga on the very next day of the launch of Fit India movement in the country, is a wonderful coincidence. AYUSH and Yoga are very important partners of the Fit India Movement.

Today there are three events. Two are associated with the awards and honors for our tradition and heritage and the third one is associated with the healthcare infrastructure. Today, 10 AYUSH Health and Wellness Centers have been launched in Haryana. I congratulate the people of Haryana for the same.

I have also got the opportunity to present awards to the practitioners of yoga, those who serve yoga, and to the friends and organizations who are promoting yoga worldwide. We have partners also from Italy and Japan who have been involved in the promotion of yoga for decades. Antonietta Rozzi has been promoting yoga through Sarva Yoga International across Europe for the past 4 decades. Similarly, Japan Yoga Niketan has thousands of yoga centers all over Japan. This institution is also doing a great job of keeping Japan free from diseases with the help of yoga for the last 4 decades. I congratulate all the awardees and wish them all success.

A short while ago, a postage stamp has also been released in the honor of 12 personalities who have enriched the AYUSH system. They are the ones who have devoted their entire lives to the treatment of people.

Some have made Yoga a medium while others have made Ayurveda the medium. Some people have served with Unani while some have freed the people from diseases using Homeopathy.

I would also congratulate the Department of Posts because issuing 12 stamps in a single set in India is a rare thing. I am sure that these Postal Stamps will help in developing new thinking in the countrymen towards AYUSH.

One of the postage stamps issued today honours Dinshaw Mehta. Dinshaw Mehta was also a physicist of Gandhiji and a dedicated worker of Naturopathy.

Gandhiji used to say - ""Naturopathy is the way of living, not a method of treatment"". He followed this practice and made the natural healing method the basis of his life.

What Gandhi learned was behind the rich heritage associated with Preventive and Curative Healthcare of India. We have thousands of years old Literature; the Vedas discuss about the treatment related to serious diseases. But unfortunately we have not been able to dovetail our ancient research and this treasure of knowledge with modernity.

We have tried to change this situation for the last 5 years. Under this, emphasis is being laid on making AYUSH an important part of India's healthcare system.

I have been told that the Sowa Rigpa system is included in the AYUSH system. Sowa Rigpa has become the sixth member of the AYUSH family after Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. Heartiest congratulations to you for the same.

If India's healthcare system has to be transformed and if we want to build a healthy society, then we must work with a holistic thinking. The shared strength of traditional and modern treatment will have to be strengthened. If AYUSH and Modern Healthcare are equally developed together, only then we will be able to create better healthcare solutions.

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is the result of this idea. Under this, health and wellness centers are being set up keeping in mind Preventive Healthcare on one hand while on the other hand PM Jan Arogya Yojana is being run for the free treatment of serious illnesses.

This is a unique and unprecedented model of Health and Wellness Center, as well as Preventive and Affordable Healthcare. In these centers, there are measures for Prevention as well as cure.

While we are opening one and a half lakh health and wellness centers in the country, we have not forgotten about AYUSH. We have also set a target to build 12 thousand five hundred AYUSH centers across the country, out of which 10 AYUSH Health and Wellness Centers have been inaugurated today. We are trying to ensure that 4000 AYUSH centers are ready by this year.

As far as Affordability is concerned, Ayushman Bharat has given the assurance of better health to the poorest of the poor. Had all the patients who have received free treatment till now under the Ayushman Bharat scheme been not under its purview, they would have had to spend more than Rs.12 thousand crores. In a way, the savings of millions of poor families of the country has been Rs 12,000 crore.

You can imagine how difficult it was for the poor to get treatment when there was no scheme like that of Ayushman Bharat. The cost of treatment had made them poorer.

Besides Prevention and Affordability, work is progressing rapidly on the necessary infrastructure in the country. Two days ago, the government has also decided to set up 75 new Medical Colleges across the country. This is another big step towards the goal of establishing a Medical College in every district of the country.

This will not only increase the facilities for the treatment of serious diseases, but will also increase the number of seats for MBBS by about 16 thousand seats. The recently enacted National Medical Commission Act is also going to play an effective role in boosting the medical education and related infrastructure in the country.

Besides modern medicine, necessary reforms are being made in the AYUSH education system to ensure that more and better professionals enter the AYUSH sector . The kind of technology being used in particular will help in preparing AYUSH for the future. The idea of a ​​AYUSH Grid is also appreciated. This will help in removing the silos mentality associated with the AYUSH sector.

The benefits of this modern infrastructure of AYUSH and medicine, are also widespread. Besides healthcare, these are proving to be huge means of employment generation in India.

There is a possibility of getting medical and Para Medical education near home especially in small villages, towns, Tier 2 and Tier - 3 cities,

With the creation of new hospitals, a whole medical ecosystem is developing there. Consequently, young friends from less educated background to degree, diploma holders are also getting new employment opportunities.

Today, as we are moving ahead with the target of $ 5 trillion economy, AYUSH is going to play a major role in it. In the coming few years, the Preventive Healthcare market in India is also going to expand a lot. This is a big opportunity.

We have to develop our Preventive Healthcare System as an attractive brand for the whole world. We have entered into agreements with 17 countries of the world; and right now we need to speed it up.

Yoga has become an important part of life all over the world today. In the last 5 years, the enthusiasm shown for Yoga on the International Day of Yoga is unprecedented in the world. Today Yoga is becoming a great medium to connect not only wellness but also the world with India.

Now, apart from yoga, we have to make efforts to deliver other genres of AYUSH all over the world.

We also have to change our habit of forgetting our old traditions and then learning it afresh when someone else tells us about it.

Let me give you an example.

Today we see that the world has started adopting the food that we gave up. Barley, jowar, ragi, kodo, sama, millet, sawa, many such cereals were once part of our food. But gradually it disappeared from our plates. This food was tagged with poverty.

Now we can see that this nutritious diet is in demand all over the world.  Now a days when we go to online shopping portals, we are often surprised. The grain, which was not ready to be taken for free, is being sold at the rate of hundreds of rupees per kg.

Now the time has come to replenish this treasure of Nutrition. The country will have to work hard on the Millet Revolution. Farmers should grow Millets and our industries related to food processing should create such attractive products from them, which will be liked by every generation and will also become a part of their diet.

The important aspect is that millets can grow in all types of soil and also take less water. That is, India has a huge advantage. We can produce millets for the whole world.

This will help India to become the brand of Preventive Healthcare; it will help serve humanity and will help increase the income of the farmers.

There is another aspect of AYUSH on which we need to work more seriously. Medical tourism in India is growing continuously. But it still has a lot of scope. All the necessary infrastructure for medical and meditation, it is being developed with the help of state governments.

I will make a special request to the Ministry of AYUSH to keep contacting different ministries and departments in this regard. We have to take medical tourism to every part of the country, especially to the North East.

When we make all these efforts collectively, our traditional medical practices will not only develop good health but also prosperity for the 21st century India, New India. Finally, once again I congratulate all the award winners.

You should keep doing the same work to keep the country and the world fit. With this expectation, I offer my gratitude to you all. 

Thank you !

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the Malayala Manorama News Conclave 2019 in Kochi via video conferencing today. 

 

Prime Minister lauded Malaya Manorama for its contribution in making the citizens of Kerala more aware and for its role in supporting India's freedom movement. 

 

Collective Aspirations are the Core of New India:

 

Speaking on the theme of Conclave - “New India”, the Prime Minister said the individual aspirations, collective endeavors and a spirit of ownership for national progress are at the core of New India.  He emphasized that New India is about participative democracy, a citizen-centric government and pro-active citizenry. He added that New India is the era of Responsive people and responsive government.

The Prime Minister said, spirit of New India is now visible in various areas, be it sports or start-up eco-system. He noted that courageous youngsters from small towns and villages are converting their aspiration into excellence and making India proud. In this context, Prime Minister said, “This for me is the New India Spirit. This is an India where the surnames of the youth do not matter. What matters is their ability to make their own name. This is an India where corruption is never an option, whoever the person is. Only competence is the norm.” He stressed that New India is about the voice of each and every of the 130 crore Indians, and asserted that it is vital for media platforms to hear this voice of the people.

Speaking about the work done by the Government, he enumerated several efforts undertaken-  'Ease of Living', keeping prices under control, building 1.25 crore homes in five years, electrifying all villages, providing water to every household, improving health as well as education infrastructure. He also mentioned that 36 crore bank accounts have been opened, 20 crore loans given to small enterprise, over 8 crore gas connections ensured smoke free kitchens, pace of road construction has doubled.

 

From “Will We” to “We Will”

The Prime Minister said, “How the spirit has changed in India can be summed up using just two words. Five years ago, people would ask- will we? Will we ever be free from dirt? Will we ever remove policy paralysis? Will we ever eliminate corruption? Today people say- we will! We will be a Swachh Bharat. We will be a nation free from corruption. We will make good governance a mass movement. The word ‘will', which earlier denoted a pessimistic question now reflects the optimistic spirit of a youthful nation.”

Prime Minister said Government is working holistically to create a New India. In this context, he spoke about Government’s approach in building 1.5 crore homes for the poor. Prime Minister stated that they followed a holistic approach - deliver more facilities, deliver more value, deliver in less time and deliver at no extra cost. He added that needs of the people were heard, local artisans involved, and technology was made an important component of this process.

The Prime Minister said, our vision for New India includes not only caring for those living in the nation but also outside. Our diaspora is our pride, contributing to India's economic growth.  

Speaking about his recent visit to Bahrain, he said that he is honoured to be the first ever-Indian Prime Minister to visit there. He also mentioned that one of the highlights of the visit was the compassionate decision of the Royal Family to pardon 250 Indians serving sentences there. Prime Minister also mentioned about the launch of RuPay card in UAE and said it will benefit the lakhs of people working in the Gulf who also send remittances back home.

Prime Minister Modi highlighted the positive role played by the media in various movements such as Swachh Bharat, eliminating single use plastic, water conservation, Fit India and others.

 

Language has the Power to Unite:

Highlighting language’s power to unite India, Prime Minister asked media if it could play the role of a bridge to bring people speaking different languages closer. He suggested that Media can publish one word in 10-12 different languages. He said that, in this way, in a year, a person can learn over 300 new words in different languages. Once a person learns another Indian language, he will come to know the common threads and truly appreciate the oneness in Indian culture. 

The Prime Minister said, it is our duty to fulfil the dreams of our founding fathers and build the India that would make them proud.

                Mr. Memon Mathew, Mr. Jacob Mathew, Mr. Jayant Jacob Mathew, Mr. Prakash Javdekar and Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Dear guests, Namaskaram, 

I am extremely happy to be addressing the Malayala Manorama New Conclave 2019. I salute the holy soil of Kerala and its unique culture.  It is the land of spiritual and social enlightenment, giving India great sons and daughters like Adi Shankara, Mahatma Ayyankali, Sree Narayana Guru, Chattambi Swamigal  Pandit Karuppan, Saint Kuriakose Elias Chavara, Saint Alphonso and other greats. Kerala is also special for me, personally. I have had numerous opportunities to visit Kerala. One of the first things I did after the people blessed me yet again with a big responsibility is visiting the Guruvayur Sri Krishna Temple.

 

Friends,

 

My addressing the Malayala Manorama New conclave has generated great curiosity. Usually, it is believed that public figures prefer to be on forums whose thought process matches with the person's own world view. Because there is a lot of comfort in being among such people. Of course, I also cherish being among such surroundings but at the same time, I believe there must be a constant and continuous dialogue between individuals and organisations irrespective of one's thought process. 

We need not have to agree on everything but there must be enough civility in public life for differing streams to be able to hear each other's point of view. Here I am, at a forum where perhaps I do not have many whose thought process is similar to mine but there are enough thinking people whose constructive criticism is something I greatly look forward to.

 

Friends, 

 

I am aware that Malayala Manorama has been a part of the Malayali mind space for over a century now. It has made the citizens of Kerala more aware, through its reportage. It has also played a part in supporting India's freedom movement. Many youngsters, especially those appearing for competitive examinations would have read your yearbook!  Thus, you are also well-known across generations. I salute all the editors, reporters and staff who have been a part of this great journey.

 

Friends, 

 

The organisers of this conclave have picked a very interesting theme- New India. Critics will ask you- are you also speaking the language of Modi Ji now?  I hope you have your answers ready for that! But, since you have picked a theme so close to my heart, let me take this opportunity to share with you what I think is the spirit of New India. 

 

Friends,

 

I have always said - we may move or not, we may be open to change or not India is changing fast and this change is happening for the good. At the core of the New India spirit are individual aspirations, collective endeavors. and a spirit of ownership for national progress. New India is about participative democracy, a citizen-centric government and pro-active citizenry. New India is the era of Responsive people and responsive government.

Distinguished guests, for many years, a culture was perpetrated in which aspiration became a bad word. Doors opened depending on your contacts. Success depended on whether or not you belonged to an Old Boy's club. Big cities, select big institutions and big families - this is all that mattered. The economic culture of License Raj and Permit Raj struck at the heart of individual ambitions. But, today things are changing for the better. We see a spirit of New India in the vibrant start-up eco-system. Thousands of talented youngsters are creating fantastic platforms, show-casing their spirit of enterprise. We also see this spirit on the sports field. 

India is now excelling in new arenas where we were hardly present earlier. Be it start-ups or sports, who is powering this vibrancy? It is courageous youngsters from small towns and villages most people would not even have heard of. They do not belong to established families or have big bank balances. What they have in plenty is dedication and aspiration. They are converting that aspiration into excellence and making India proud. This for me is the New India Spirit. This is an India where the surnames of the youth do not matter. What matters is their ability to make their own name. This is an India where corruption is never an option, whoever the person is. Only competence is the norm. 

 

Friends, 

 

New India is not about the voice of a select few.  It is about the voice of each and every of the 130 crore Indians. And, for media platforms, it is vital to hear this voice of the people. Today we are seeing that every citizen wants to do something or the other for the nation.  Every citizen either wants to contribute or give up something for the nation. Take for example the most recent step to reduce single use plastic. This is not only Narendra Modi's idea or effort. The people of India have taken it upon themselves to make India free of single use plastic at a time when we mark Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary. These are extra-ordinary times and we should not leave any opportunity that enables us to transform our nation.

 

Friends,

 

As a Government, we have done everything possible to further individual ambitions and collective efforts for India's betterment. Steps to improve 'Ease of Living', be it keeping prices under control, building 1.25 crore homes in five years, electrifying all villages, providing water to every household, improving health as well as education infrastructure are aimed towards creating the right enabling environment for our youth. The scale and extent to which this government has worked is mind boggling. We have reached the very last mile, at phenomenal speed and with unparalleled scale. 36 crore bank accounts have been opened, 20 crore loans given to small enterprise, over 8 crore gas connections ensured smoke free kitchens, pace of road construction has doubled. 

These are just some examples. However, what makes me happiest, and which according to me is the essence of New India, is how the people of India have risen above self interest and looked at societal interest.  Why else would the poorest of the poor deposit over Rupees One Lakh Crore

in Jan Dhan accounts despite these being zero balance accounts? Why else would our middle class give up their own gas subsidy? Why else would the elderly give up their railway concession on just one request? 

Maybe this is a manifestation of what was spoken a century ago by Gandhi Ji in the form of the doctrine of trusteeship. Today, there is a sincere desire not only to be a spectator of India's transformation but also to play their own part in it. No wonder even the number of tax-payers have risen. The people have decided that they want to take India ahead! 

 

Friends, 

 

You would be seeing changes that were earlier deemed as totally impossible. In a state like Haryana, it was not thinkable that recruitment for government jobs could be done transparently. But, go to any village of Haryana and people are talking about the transparent manner in which recruitments took place. Now, it is common to see people using Wi-Fi facilities in railway stations.  

Who would have ever thought this would be a reality. Earlier, platforms were associated with goods and passengers. But now, in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, students go to stations after school or college, use the free Wi-Fi and excel. The system is the same, the people are the same yet, massive changes have taken place on the ground.

 

Friends, 

 

How the spirit has changed in India can be summed up using just two words. Five years ago, people would ask- will we? Will we ever be free from dirt? Will we ever remove policy paralysis? Will we ever eliminate corruption? Today people say- we will! We will be a Swachh Bharat. We will be a nation free from corruption. We will make good governance a mass movement. The word ‘will', which earlier denoted a pessimistic question now reflects the optimistic spirit of a youthful nation.

 

Friends, 

 

I want to share with you an example of how our Government is working holistically to create a New India. You all know that our government has created over 1.5 crore homes for the poor at a rapid pace. This is a huge improvement over the previous government. A lot of people ask me that schemes and funds did exist previously also, then what did you do differently? They have the right to ask the question. 

First of all, we were conscious of the fact that we were not creating houses, but were building homes. Thus we needed to move away from the concept of merely constructing four walls. Our approach was deliver more facilities, deliver more value, deliver in less time and deliver at no extra cost.

The homes that our government built did not take a rigid architecture approach. We built homes according to local requirements and wishes of the people. To deliver all basic facilities, we achieved convergence of various government schemes. So the homes would have electricity, gas connection, toilet and all such necessities. 

To deliver more value, we heard the needs of the people and not only increased the area of the homes but also increased the construction amount. We also involved local artisans and labour in this process, including women. To deliver in less time and at no extra cost, we made technology an important component of this process. Photos of construction at various stages would get uploaded online giving a clear picture to the administration. Direct transfer of the money resulted in no leakage and complete satisfaction. Now if you think back, this could not have been successful with any one of these interventions. Neither technology alone would have solved the problems nor convergence of schemes alone would have solved problems. Solutions at scale are possible when all interventions come together to deliver holistic results. This has been the hallmark of our government.

 

Friends, 

 

Our vision for New India includes not only caring for those living in the nation but also outside. Our diaspora is our pride, contributing to India's economic growth. Whenever any Indian overseas has faced a problem, we have been at the forefront of solving it. When Indian nurses were captured in different parts of West Asia, no stone was left unturned to bring them back home. Most of these nurses belonged to South India. The same spirit was seen when Father Tom, another son of Kerala, was captured. Many people came back from Yemen. 

I have been to several West Asian nations and high on my agenda is spending time with the Indians. I just came back from a visit to Bahrain. This is a nation that is a valued friend, home to so many Indians, but never has an Indian Prime Minister visited there. This honour was left for me! One of the highlights was the compassionate decision of the Royal Family to pardon 250 Indians serving sentences there. Similar pardons have been granted by Oman and Saudi Arabia. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia increased India's Haj quota. 

Friends, in my recent visit to UAE, the RuPay card was launched there and Bahrain will also have the RuPay card soon. Apart from the push to digital transactions, this will benefit the lakhs of people working in the Gulf who also send remittances back home. Today I am proud when I hear that India's relations with the Gulf are better than ever before. Needless to say, it is common citizens who will gain the most thanks to this.

Friends, we are seeing a spirit of the New India in the media Today, India has the most diverse and growing media. The number of newspapers, magazines, TV channels, websites are constantly rising. At this point, may I also highlight the positive role played by the media in various movements be it Swachh Bharat, eliminating single use plastic, water conservation, Fit India and more. They have made these movements their own, and mobilised people to achieve remarkable causes. 

Friends, for ages, language has always been a very powerful vehicle for the most popular ideas traveling across time and distance. India is perhaps the only country in the world with so many languages. In a way it is a force multiplier. But language also been exploited by selfish interests to create artificial walls in the country to divide. Today, I have a humble suggestion. Can we not use the power of language to unite India? 

Can media play the role of a bridge to and bring people speaking different languages closer. This is not as difficult as it seems. We can simply start with publishing one word in 10-12 different languages spoken across the country. In a year, a person can learn over 300 new words in different languages. Once a person learns another Indian language, he will come to know the common threads and truly appreciate the oneness in Indian culture. This can also give rise to groups of people interested to learn different languages. Imagine a group in Haryana learning Malayalam and a group in Karnataka learning Bengali! All big distances were covered only after taking the first step, can we take the first step?

 

Friends, 

 

The great sages who walked on this land, our founding fathers, those who took part in the freedom struggle had great dreams. In the 21st century, it is our duty to fulfil them and build the India that would make them proud. 

 

I am confident that we can achieve this, and a lot more together in the times to come.

 

Once again, my best wishes to the Malayala Manorama group and I thank you all for inviting me.

 

Thank you. Thank you very much.

                My Cabinet colleague Shri Narendra Singh ji Tomar, Dr. Harsh Vardhan ji, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank ji and the leadership of this entire campaign, Shri Kiren Rijiju ji, all the senior dignitaries present here, all the stars of the sports world and my dear student brothers And sisters!

Some people might think that they do not go to school or to college, then why did Modi ji just address them as 'students'. You guys have come here, whatever is your age, but I believe your inner student is still alive.


Happy National Sports Day to all of you. On this day itself, we had received a great sports person in the form of Major Dhyan Chand. He mesmerized the world with his fitness, stamina and hockey stick. Today I pay my respects to Major Dhyanchand ji.


Today, I congratulate the Ministry of Sports, Youth Department for the important step towards a Healthy India and for launching such an initiative, Fit India Movement, which is an important step towards this concept.


There were messages of fitness every moment in this presentation delivered today. The presentation also talked about how we can keep ourselves fit by reminding us of traditions in the best way. And these things have been presented so well that I feel no need of deliver my speech. If we make all the things or even a couple of these things mentioned here in the presentation a part of life; I do not believe that I will need to preach anything for fitness.


I congratulate everyone for this excellent work, for this best kind of presentation, and also those who have conceptualized it, have added new looks to it and have painstakingly presented it. I would like a good professional video being created out of it in the future, and be shown in all schools and colleges so that a mass movement is created.

Friends, this day is also to congratulate our young players, who are constantly giving new heights to the glory of the tri-color on the world stage. Be it Badminton, Tennis, Athletics, Boxing, Wrestling or other sports, our players are giving new wings to our expectations and aspirations. The medals won, is not only the result of their tenacity and penance, but also a measure of new enthusiasm and new confidence of New India. I am glad that the efforts made to create a better environment for India's sports in the last five years are visible to us today.


Sports is directly related to fitness. But the Fit India Movement that has started today has expanded beyond sports. Fitness is not a word but a necessary condition of a healthy and prosperous life. In our culture there has always been a lot of emphasis on fitness. We have given priority to measures for better health, refraining after a disease. Fitness has been a comfortable part of our lives. And here, our ancestors, and companions have repeatedly said -

 

व्यायामात् लभते स्वास्थ्यं दीर्घायुष्यं बलं सुखं।

आरोग्यं परमं भाग्यं स्वास्थ्यं सर्वार्थसाधनम्॥

 

That is, one gets health, long life, strength and happiness by exercising. Being healthy is the ultimate destiny, and all other tasks get accomplished by health. But definitions have changed over time - earlier we were taught, we used to hear that all tasks are accomplished by health, now we get to hear that all works are accomplished by selfishness. And so it is necessary to make a collective effort to turn this selfishness back to health.

 

I know that some people must be thinking that fitness is important, we also know that, and then what is the need of such a sudden movement? Friends, there is a need and perhaps the need is even more dire today. Fitness has been an integral part of our way of life, but it is also true that over time, there has been apathy in our society regarding fitness.


I give you an example of how times have changed. Till a few decades ago, a normal person would walk 8-10 kilometres in a day, or ride a cycle for a few hours, or would sometimes run to catch a bus. That is, physical activity used to be easy in life. Then gradually technology changed, modern means arrived on the scene and the person's walking was reduced. Physical activity decreased considerably. And what is the situation now? Technology has led us to such a condition that we are moving less and the same technology tells us the number of steps that you walked today, 5000 steps have not been completed yet, 2000 steps have not been completed, and we keep watching mobile phones. How many of you present here do that - keeping a check on 5000 or 10000 steps? There would be many people who must have worn this type of a watch or have downloaded these apps on the mobile phone and check their steps on mobile every day.

Many of you are alert and cautious, but there are also a large number of people in the country who are so busy in their daily lives that they cannot focus on their fitness. And some of them are even more special. You might have seen some things become fashion statements. And so there are friends who sit at the dining table, eat heavy meals, often double the required amount and talk about dieting very comfortably. At least ten days in a month you will feel that you are sitting at the dining table, overeating and giving long lectures on dieting. That is, these people also talk excitedly and keep buying gadgets related to it and they feel that if they have such new gadgets, probably they will become fit. And you must have seen that there will be a huge gym in their houses, everything related to fitness will be there but servants have to be kept for cleaning the equipment because they never enter that gym and after a few days put those things in the farthest room of the house. People are also expert in downloading fitness apps on mobiles, but after a few days, they never even see that app.

 

I was born in Gujarat. We had a very good comedy writer here in Gujarat named Jyotindra bhai Dave. He used to write interesting satires. And mostly he used to write satires on himself. Well, he used to describe his body and say - whenever I stand somewhere, or stand near the wall, people thought that some clothes were hanging on a hanger. Because, he was so thin that it seemed like clothes are hung on a hangar and so no one was ready to believe that it was a human being standing there. Then he used to write - if I step out of the house, I walk with stones in my pocket. He wore coats, and all of the pockets were filled with stones. So people thought, maybe he would throw stones and hit people. So people used to ask him - why do you carry so many stones? So he said - I am afraid that the wind might blow him away. He used to write such funny things. Once someone told him that instead of walking around with stones, you should do a little exercise and go to the gym. So he asked the gentleman how much exercise should be done. He said, just get a little sweated to at least start it first. Go to the gym and sweat it out. So he said - Okay, will go tomorrow. So the other day he said - I reached the gymnasium and those wrestlers started their wrestling in the arena. So he said - After going there, as he started looking at those wrestlers, he started sweating so I thought I completed my exercise. That is, it is definitely a joke but it is also telling us about maintaining good health. However, some concerns are even bigger.


Today, many lifestyle diseases like diabetes and hypertension are increasing in India. Sometimes we hear that a child of 12-15 years in the family has become a diabetic patient. Look around you, you will find many people suffering from these diseases. Earlier we used to hear that the risk of heart attack increases after the age of 50-60, but today sometimes we hear that a 30 year, 35 years, or a 40 years old son and daughter are dying of heart attacks. This situation is indeed very worrisome, but there is also a ray of hope. Now you will wonder how am I talking about the ray of hope even in the midst of these diseases. I am a very positive person by nature. So I find some good things out of that too.

 

Lifestyle diseases are occurring due to lifestyle disorder. Now we can change Lifestyle disorder by changing the lifestyle. There are many diseases that we can avoid, by making small changes in our daily routine, and by changing our lifestyle, we can keep them away. Fit India Movement is basically a movement for motivating people to make these changes. And this is not a government movement. The government will pursue this subject as a catalytic agent, but in every way the agenda of every family should be concerning this. It should become the topic of discussion of every family. If the businessman calculates how much he earns every month, or the family concerned about education discusses the marks of the son; in the same way, physical labour, physical exercise and physical fitness, should also become a matter of discussion in everyday life within the family.

And friends, this is not particularly something that is needed only in India. And this change is coming not only in India. The need for such campaigns is being felt all over the world today. Many countries are running big campaigns to increase awareness about fitness. In our neighbourhood, i.e. in China - Healthy China 2030 is being implemented on mission mode. That is, by 2030, every citizen of China should be fit. And for this, they have prepared a complete time table. Similarly, to increase the physical activity of Australians and to change the inactive and lazy nature of its citizens, they have set the goal that by 2030, 15 per cent of the citizens will be taken out of laziness and made fit. The campaign is going on vigorously in the UK as per which by 2020, 5 lakh new people should join daily exercise routine. By 2021, America is working to connect one thousand cities with free fitness campaign. In Germany too, a major campaign named 'fit instead of fat' is going on.

 

I have named only a few countries. Many countries have already started working on it. People in all these countries understand the need for fitness, yet they have started special campaigns there. Think - why? Because not only some people will be fit, but the country will benefit only by staying fit. Every citizen of New India should be fit, and should use his/her energy not in the treatment of diseases but in advancing oneself and the family, and taking the country forward. We have to move forward in this direction.


When you set a goal in life, then our life starts to mould according to that goal. Life changes, our habits become like that, our routines become like that. We have a habit of getting up at eight o'clock in the morning, but if you have to catch a flight at 6 o'clock in the morning, or a train at 6 o'clock, then we get up, get ready and leave. If a student aims at a score for 10th or 12th board, then you must have seen that he starts making major changes in himself. To achieve his goal, his laziness ceases, his sitting capacity increases, his concentration capacity increases. He reduces his time spent with friends gradually, changes his eating habits a little. He stops watching TV, that is, he starts moulding his life because of the goal in his mind.

Similarly, if someone makes wealth creation the goal of his life, then his life also changes. He spends twenty-four hours achieving his goal. Similarly, when one becomes fitness conscious and health conscious, if the mind decides once - I will not get tired at all, I will walk, I will run, I will climb and will not stop. You see, gradually your life routine also starts becoming the same. And then the person stays away from such things that harm the body because a consciousness comes inside it, he becomes aware. So, he will never be under the grip of drugs. Drugs will never be cool or a style statement for him.

 

Swami Vivekananda also used to say that if there is purpose in life, and if you work towards it with full passion then good health, happiness and prosperity will find way in your life as its by-product. To achieve the purpose of our life, it is equally important to have a passion, and a will. When we work with passion, with a purpose, we move forward. Then success is certainly ours. And you must have also heard that saying on success - There is no elevator to success, you have to take the stairs. That is, even in this saying you have been asked to climb the steps of the ladder. You will be able to climb steps only when you are fit, otherwise if the lift is not working, you will think - man, I will not go today, who will climb stairs up to the fourth floor?


The relationship between success and fitness is complementary to each other. Take any field today, look at your icons, see their success stories, whether they are in sports, films, business, most of them are fit. This is not just a coincidence. If you read about their lifestyle, you will find that one thing is common among them. The common character of successful people is their focus on fitness and their faith in fitness. You must have seen many popular doctors as well who perform operations on many patients for 10-12 hours a day. Many entrepreneurs hold one meeting in one city in the morning, and the other meetings in another city, but there is no sign of stress on their faces. They work with equal alertness. In any profession, if you want to bring efficiency in your work, then mental and physical fitness are very important. Whether it is Boardroom or Bolly wood, whoever is fit touches the sky. If the body is fit, then mind is hit!


Friends,

When we pay attention to fitness, and try to keep ourselves healthy by focusing on fitness, then it gives us a chance to understand our body as well. It is surprising, but we know very little about our body, our strengths, and weaknesses. So when we embark upon our journey towards fitness, we begin to understand our body better. And I have seen many people who have known and recognized the power of their body. This has also boosted their confidence, which has helped them in building a better personality.


Even though the government has started the Fit India campaign, it is for all of you to lead it. The people of the country will carry forward this campaign and will reach great heights of success. I can say from my personal experience that it needs zero Investment, but the returns are unlimited.

 

The Human Resource Development Minister and the Rural Development Minister are also present here. I have a special request to them - this campaign should reach every village and every Panchayat of the country, as well as every school in the country. This campaign is not just of a ministry or just of the government, whether it is the central or the state government, the municipality, the Panchayat, any party, or any ideology. There should not be a problem for anyone when it comes to fitness. The whole country, every family should emphasize upon this. We have just seen in this programme, that besides fitness, valour has also being given immense importance, but unfortunately due to limited and narrow thinking; we have derailed such a vehicle from our traditions. For example, the when the people who are 60-70 or 80 years of age, used to study in school, they were taught 'S' for sword. Later some intelligent people raised a controversy, a result of narrow thinking, and said if you teach 'sword' to children it can lead to a violent attitude in them. So what to do, then the word sword, was taken out and was replaced by something else. That is, how we have hurt our great traditions, as well as physical strength and fitness too deeply psychologically. 


And so I would like fitness to be considered as the standard of success for a family and must consider fitness as a festival, and as a part of life. Fitness should also be a standard in the successes of a person's life. We must move ahead with this spirit and I would like to urge the state governments to come forward to expand the Fit India Movement more and more and to take it to the far-flung areas of the country, to our schools, offices, by raising awareness of fitness among the people of your state, and by mobilizing the necessary resources for them. We have to motivate more and more people to give some time daily to fitness. Healthy people, healthy families and healthy society, this is the way to make the New India the best India. Just like you have made Swachh Bharat Abhiyan a part of your life, similarly Fit India Movement has to be a part of your life.


Come, take this resolution today, take this pledge that you will remain fit, and also encourage your family, friends, neighbours, and everyone you know to be fit. If I am fit then India too will be fit.


With this one request, I once again convey my best wishes to the countrymen for this campaign and I urge the people who lead in every section of the society to come forward, strengthen this movement, and be a partner in making the society healthy. With this one expectation and best wishes, I thank you very much.

“Their medals are a not only the result of their hard work but reflection of a new zeal and new confidence of a New India”, the PM said.

The Prime Minister said that ‘Fit India Movement’ should become a national goal and its aspiration. In an effort to inspire the nation, the Prime Minister said that Fit India Movement may have been started by the government but it is the people who have to lead it and make it a success.

“Success is related to fitness, success stories of all of our icons from any field of life have a common thread- most of them are fit, have a focus on fitness and are fond of fitness”, the PM added.

Prime Minister said, “Technology has reduced our physical ability and has robbed us of our daily fitness routines and today we are unaware of our traditional practises and lifestyle which could keep us fit. With time, fitness has been relegated a lower priority in our society. Earlier a person used to walk or cycle for kilometers, today mobile apps have to tell us how many steps we walked”.

“Today lifestyle diseases are on a rise in India affecting even the young. Cases of diabetes and hypertension is on the rise and even common among children in India. But small lifestyle changes can prevent these lifestyle diseases. ‘Fit India Movement’ is an effort to bring these small lifestyle changes”, the PM said.

The Prime Minister said that people in any profession can make themselves efficient in their profession if they are mentally and physical fit. If body is fit, then you would be mentally fit. Sports has a direct relation to fitness but ‘Fit India Movement’ aims to go beyond fitness. Fitness is not just a word but an essential pillar to a healthy and prosperous life. When we prepare our bodies for battle, we make the country strong as iron. Fitness is part of our historic legacy. Games and sports are played in every nook and corner of India. While working on the body they also train the mind, increasing focus and coordination of body parts. A healthy Individual, a healthy family and a healthy society are the essentials to make New India a Fit India.

“Swasth vyakti, swasth parivar aur swasth samaj, yahi naye Bharat ko shresth Bharat banane ka raasta hai. Today, on National Sports Day we pledge to strengthen the Fit India Movement”, the Prime Minister said.

                My dear countrymen, Namaskar. On the one hand, these days, our country is enjoying the feast of rains; on the other, every corner of the country is celebrating festivals and fairs. And this will go on till Diwali. Perhaps our ancestors intricately wove the annual seasonal cycle, the economy cycle and social & life systems in a way that ensured, that under no circumstances, dullness crept into society. We celebrated quite a few festivals in the days gone by. Yesterday, Krishna- Janma Mahotsav, the festival of the birth of Lord Krishna was celebrated throughout India. Can anyone even imagine the greatness of his personality, that, even after thousands of years, the festival comes along with renewed novelty, a new inspiration with fresh energy. And the noble being that he was; although millennia ago, yet it is relevant in providing solutions to problems as well as inspiration even today. Everyone can find solutions to present day problems from Shri Krishna’s life. Despite the tremendous might that he possessed, there were times when he would immerse himself in performing the RAAS; at other times he would be in the midst of cows and cowherds; sometimes indulging in sports & games; often playing the flute. A personality brimming with diverse talents and immense capability, yet devoted to empowering society and people, a persona that embodied pioneering accomplishments, a repository, a savior of people. What qualities should the virtue of friendship possess? Who can forget the incident of Sudama? And on the battlefield? Despite his myriad facets of greatness, assuming the role of a charioteer! Or running errands such as lifting a hillock, or at other times picking up leftover leaf plates! One feels a sense of newness in whatever he does. And that’s why today, as I converse with you, my attention is drawn towards two Mohans. One is the Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan and the other is the Charkha bearing Mohan. The Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan left the banks of the Yamuna for the sea beach of Gujarat, establishing himself in the city of Dwarika, while the Mohan born on the sea beach reached the banks of the Yamuna, breathing his last in Delhi. Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan, thousands of years ago, had amply used his wisdom, his sense of duty, his might, his worldview to avert war, to prevent conflict, a sign of the times then. And spinning-wheel bearing Mohan too chose a similar path, for the sake of Freedom, for preserving human values, for strengthening the basic elements of personality & character- for this he lent a certain hue to the Freedom struggle, a turn, that left the whole world awe struck, which it still remains today. The importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge, or be it marching ahead smilingly, amidst the trials and tribulations of life, we can learn all these from Lord Krishna’s life’s message. And that is why Shri Krishna is known as Jagatguru – teacher to the world… ‘Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum’.

Today, as we discuss festivities, preparations are under way for a mega festival in India. Not just in India, it is a part of the discourse in the whole world. My dear countrymen, I’m referring to the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. On the 2nd of October, 1869, at the beach of Porbandar, in Kirti Mandir as it is known today,… in that tiny abode, not just a person; an era was born, that charted the course of human history on an altogether new path, with trail blazing accomplishments on the way. One attribute has always been part & parcel of Mahatma Gandhi’s being – and that was his sense of service and the sense of duty towards it. If you view his life in entirety, you will note that he served communities in South Africa that were bearing the brunt of apartheid – in those times, it was, by no means a small feat. He served farmers in Champaran who were being discriminated against. He served millworkers who were being underpaid. He served the poor, the destitute, the weak and the hungry… he took it as life’s prime duty. There were many myths associated with leprosy then. In order to dispel them, he closely served people suffering from leprosy. He presented shining examples through the medium of service in his own life. He set examples of the sense of service for others to learn- not through words, but through deeds. Gandhiji shared an unbreakable bond with truth; he shared a similar unique bond with the spirit of service. Whoever, needed him, and wherever, Gandhiji was present to serve. He emphasized not only on the spirit of service, but also on the inner happiness it led to. Service as a virtue is meaningful when it is performed with a sense of joy-‘Seva Parmo Dharmah’. But simultaneously, deep inner joy, the essence of ‘Swantah Sukhaayah’ is inbuilt in the spirit of service. We can understand this from Bapu’s life. Mahatma Gandhi, of course, became the voice of innumerable Indians, in the larger backdrop of upholding human values & human dignity; in a way, he had become the voice of the world. For Mahatma Gandhi, the individual and society, human beings & humanity was everything. Whether it was the Phoenix Farm or the Tolstoy Farm in Africa, the Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he laid special emphasis on community mobilization in his own distinct way. I have been extremely fortunate to have been blessed with the opportunity to visit a number of significant places associated with revered Mahatma Gandhi and pay my homage. I can say that Gandhi emphasized on the spirit of collectiveness through a sense of service. Community service and community mobilization are virtues which we have to imbibe into our real lives. This would be the real way of paying true tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, the Karyanjali, the offering of deeds. Opportunities like these come often & we get associated with them. But should Gandhi 150 just come & go; will it be acceptable to us? No dear countrymen. All of us should introspect, dwell upon it, discuss it, bring it into collective discourse. Joining hands with more people of the society, from all strata, from all age groups; people from villages, cities, men, women, we should ask ourselves. As an individual, what can I add to the effort? What value addition could be there from my side? And being collective acquires its own strength. In all the programmes of Gandhi 150, let there be a sense of collectiveness, let there be a spirit of service. Why don’t we join hands and let the entire neighbourhood move together? If there is a football team, then the entire team. Of course we’ll play football, but along with it, we’ll pick up a deed to perform in conformity with one of Gandhi’s ideals of service. There could be a Ladies’ club! Routine tasks of a modern day Ladies’ club shall be taken up, but besides that, let all members of the Ladies’ club come together & perform an activity of service! We can do a lot. Collect old books, distribute them amongst the poor, spread the glow of knowledge. And I do believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen are endowed with 130 crore ideas & there could be 130 crore endeavours. There is no limit- whatever that comes to your mind- but only with a genuine wish, a noble intention, within the realms of harmony, and with complete dedication… that too for the sake of enjoying that rare inner bliss, the core of ‘Swaantah Sukhaayah’.

My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I was in Dandi. In our Freedom struggle, the salt satyagrah at Dandi was an important turning point. There I’d inaugurated a state of the art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi. I sincerely urge you to visit at least one place associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the days to come. It could be any site… such as Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaran, the Ashram at Wardha or spots in Delhi related to Mahatma Gandhi. When you visit them, do share your photographs on social media so that others may be inspired. And do pen a couple of sentences or couplets to express your feelings. Emotions that emanate from the core of your heart will be more compelling than any great literary composition. And it is possible that in present times, from your viewpoint, the pen-picture of Gandhi sketched by you, may perhaps appear more relevant. In the times to come, many programmes, competitions & exhibitions have been planned. In this context I feel like sharing with you something very interesting. There is a famous art show called the Venice Biennale’, where people from the world over congregate. This time, in the India Pavilion at the Venice Biennale’, a very interesting exhibition based on memories of Gandhiji was organized. Of special interest were the Haripura Panels. You may remember that in the Haripura Congress Session in Gujarat, Subhash Chandra Bose being elected as President is recorded in history. These Art Panels have a beautiful past. Before the Haripura Session, in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal of Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan, Nandlal Bose. It was Gandhiji’s wish that the lifestyle of the people of India be depicted through the medium of art and this artwork may be exhibited during the session. This is the same Nandlal Bose whose artwork adorns our Constitution; lends to the Constitution a new, unique identity. The very commitment & reverence of Nandlal Bose have made him, along with the Constitution, immortal. Nandlal Bose toured villages around Haripura, concluding with a few works of art canvas, depicting glimpses of life in rural India. This invaluable artwork was a high point of discourse at Venice. Once again, along with greetings on Gandhiji’s 150th birth anniversary, I express my expectations from every Indian, of one resolve or the other. One should do something for the sake of the country, society or just for someone else. This will be a good, true & genuine Karyanjali to Bapu, a tribute through a good deed.

O glorious children of Mother India, you may remember that for the last few years, we have been running a countrywide campaign ‘Swachchata Hi Sewa’, ‘the quest for cleanliness is service’, around a couple of weeks before the 2nd of October. This time around it will commence on the 11th of September. During this period, all of us will move out of home, donating toil & sweat through ‘Shramdaan’, as a ‘Karyanjali’ to Mahatma Gandhi. Home or the neighbourhood lane, street circles, crossings, or drains, schools and colleges … we have to involve ourselves in a Mega campaign of ensuring cleanliness at public places. This time our emphasis must be on plastic. On 15th August, I had urged you from the Red Fort…the way one hundred & twenty five crore countrymen ran a campaign for cleanliness with utmost enthusiasm and energy, and toiled tirelessly towards freedom from open defecation; in a similar manner, we have to join hands in curbing ‘single use plastic’. This campaign has enthused people from all strata of society. Many of my merchant brothers & sisters have put up a placard at their establishments, boldly mentioning that customers ought to carry shopping bags with them. This will result in monetary savings, as well as one would be able to contribute towards protection of the environment. This year, on the 2nd of October, when we celebrate Bapu’s 150th birth anniversary, we shall not only dedicate to him an India that is Open Defecation Free, but also shall lay the foundation of a new revolution against plastic, by people themselves, throughout the country. I appeal to all strata of society, residents of every village, town & city, take it as a prayer with folded hands; let us celebrate Gandhi Jayanti this year as a mark of our plastic free Mother India. Let us celebrate 2nd October as a special day. Let us celebrate Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary as a special ‘Shramdaan’ Festival, where everyone will donate one’s own labour. I urge all municipalities, municipal corporations, District Administration, Gram Panchayats, Government & non Governmental bodies, organizations; in fact each & every citizen to work towards ensuring adequate arrangement for collection & storage of plastic waste. I also appeal to the corporate sector to come out with ways & means proactively for appropriate disposal of all accumulated plastic. It can be recycled; it can be transformed into fuel. This way we can accomplish our task of ensuring safe disposal of plastic waste before this Diwali. All that is needed is a resolve. And for inspiration, there’s no need to look hither- tither; what can be a greater inspiration than Gandhi?

My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit, epigrammatic verses are, in a way, gems of wisdom. We can derive from them whatever we need in life. These days I’m not in regular touch with the form… earlier it was frequent. Today I want to touch upon a very important point from a Sanskrit Subhashit. These lines were written centuries ago, but even today, carry great relevance. There is an excellent Subhashit that mentions – 

“ पृथिव्यां त्रीणि रत्नानि जलमन्नं सुभाषितम् |

मूढैःपाषाणखण्डेषु रत्नसंज्ञा प्रदीयते” ||

That is, water, grain and subhashit are the three gems found on earth. Imprudent people call stones as gems. In our culture much glory has been ascribed to food. We have even converted the knowledge about food into a science. Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, more so for women and the new-born, since these two categories are the foundation of the future of our society. Under the ‘Poshan Abhiyaan’ campaign, nutrition made available with the help of modern scientific methods is being converted into a mass movement all over the country. People are fighting a battle against malnutrition in innovative and interesting ways. 

Once, an interesting fact was brought to my notice. The ‘Mutthi Bhar Dhaanya’ initiative has turned into a big movement in Nashik. In this novel scheme, during the harvest period, Anganwadi workers collect a handful of rice grain from the people. This grain is used to make piping hot food for children and women. In this way, the person contributing the handful of grain transmutes into a conscientious civil social worker. In the process, he gets himself dedicated to this cause and becomes a soldier of that movement. All of us have heard about the ‘Ann Praashan Sanskar’, the first solid morsel ritual for toddlers in families all across India. This ritual is performed when the toddler starts feeding on solid food for the first time; solid and not liquid food!

In 2010, Gujarat embarked upon planning to provide kids complimentary food on the occasion of 'Ann Praashan Sanskar' so that this initiative spreads awareness among the masses. This is a great initiative that can be adopted anywhere. In many states, people run meal campaigns on certain dates. If the family celebrates a birthday, certain auspicious day or observe an in- memoriam day, then the family members with self-prepared nutritious and delicious food, go to the Anganwadis and also to the schools and these family members themselves serve the children and feed them. They not only share their happiness but in the process receive happiness magnified manifold! There is a wonderful confluence of a sense of service and satisfaction. 

My Friends, there are many little things that can be employed in our country’s effective fight against malnutrition. Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and affluent families are affected by malnutrition. The month of September will be celebrated as ‘Poshan Abhiyaan’ across the country. You must get connected with it, get information about this initiative, add some new facet to ‘Poshan Abhiyaan’ by contributing to it. If you manage to save a few people from malnutrition, it would mean that we can bring the country out of the circle of malnutrition.

Srishti Ji thank you for your phone call and just like you KK Pandey ji from Sohna, Haryana, and Aishwarya Sharma from Surat and many other people have expressed a desire to know more about the 'Man vs. Wild’ television episode aired on Discovery Channel. This time when I was thinking about 'Mann ki Baat', I was sure that a lot of questions would crop up about this subject and that’s what exactly happened. In the last few weeks wherever I went and met people, 'Man vs. Wild' gets a mention! With this one episode, I have not only formed a connect with the youth around the world but I had never thought that I would find a certain place in young hearts in this way. I had never thought that the youth of our country and the world pay attention to diverse things. 

I had never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of young people around the world. And look what happens? Just last week I went to Bhutan. I have seen that whenever I have had the opportunity to go as Prime Minister, and of course credit also goes to International Yoga Day, the situation now is that wherever I go in the world or interact with someone, people invariably spend close to 5-7 minutes asking questions on yoga. 

There must hardly be a major world leader who has not discussed yoga with me and this has been my experience all over the world. But these days I’m experiencing something new. Whoever I meet or wherever there is a chance to talk, the focus is on Wildlife, discussions about the environment, the Tiger, the Asiatic Lion, evolution etc. and I am amazed how interested people are in nature. 

The Discovery Channel plans to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their respective languages. Today, when there is a global churning of thought on environment, Global Warming, and Climate Change, I do hope that in such circumstances, this episode of Discovery Channel will help greatly in familiarizing the world with the message from India, the traditions of India and the empathy for nature in India's trail of glorious traditions. 

It is my firm belief that people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in India. But there is another interesting thing, some people ask me one thing albeit with some hesitation -Modi ji, you were speaking in Hindi and Bear Grylls does not know Hindi, so how did you carry on such a fast conversation between the two of you? Was this episode edited later? How many times did the shooting happen for this episode and how it happened? They ask with great curiosity.

Now, there is no secret in this. Many people have this question in their minds, so I will unravel this secret. Well, in a way it is no secret at all! The reality is that technology was used extensively in my conversation with Bear Grylls. Whenever I spoke immediately there was a simultaneous translation into English or simultaneous interpretation and Bear Grylls had a small cordless instrument in his ear. So I used to speak in Hindi but he heard it in English and because of that the communication became very easy and this is an amazing aspect about technology. 

After the broadcast of this show, a large number of people have been discussing about Jim Corbett National Park. You must also visit sites associated with nature and wild life and animals. As I have said before, and I emphasize, that you must visit the north-east in your lifetime. What a glorious abundance of nature exists there. You will be left wonderstruck! Your horizon will expand. On 15th August, I urged all of you from the ramparts of the Red Fort to visit at least 15 places within a span of the next 3 years, 15 places within India and for 100% tourism, visit these 15 sites! Witness and observe. Do take the family and spend some time there.

Our country is full of diversity and this wide range of diversity will also inculcate variations within you as a teacher. Your life will be enriched. Your thinking will expand. And trust me, there are places within India from where you will come back with renewed energy, enthusiasm, zeal and inspiration, and maybe you will feel like returning to certain places again and again; your family too would feel the same.

My dear countrymen, the concern and care for the environment in India seems natural. Last month I had the privilege of releasing the tiger census in the country. Do you know how many tigers there are in India? The tiger population in India is 2967, two thousand nine hundred sixty seven.

A few years ago, we were with great difficulty at a figure half of what we have at present. The Tiger summit took place in 2010 at St. Petersburg, Russia. At this summit, a resolution was taken expressing concern about the dwindling tiger population in the world. It was resolved to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022. But this is New India, where we accomplish goals in the quickest time possible. We doubled our tiger numbers in 2019 itself. Not only the tiger population in India was doubled, but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased.

At the time I was releasing the data on tigers, I also remembered the Asiatic lion of the Gir in Gujarat. I had the charge of the Chief Minister of Gujrat at a period of time when the habitat of lions in the forests of Gir was shrinking. Their number was decreasing. We took several innovative steps, one after the other in the Gir. In 2007, it was decided to deploy female guards. There were improvements in the infrastructure to increase tourism. Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about conservation. But, we now have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion. Our scriptures have provided great guidance with respect to this subject. Our scriptures have said centuries ago: -

निर्वनो बध्यते व्याघ्रो, निर्व्याघ्रं छिद्यते वनम |  

तस्माद् व्याघ्रो वनं रक्षेत्, वनं व्याघ्रं न पालयेत् ||

That is, if there are no forests, tigers are forced to venture into the human habitat and are killed, and if there are no tigers in the forest, then man cuts the forest and destroys it, so in fact the tiger protects the forest and not that the forest protects the tiger - our forefathers explained this great truth in a befitting manner. Therefore, we need to not only conserve our forests, flora and fauna, but also create an environment wherein they can flourish properly.

My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda delivered on September 11, 1893. This young monk of India, who shook the conscience of the human race of the entire world, imparted onto this world a glorious identity of India. The enslaved India which was gazed at by the world in a much distorted manner was forced to change its way of looking at India due to the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893. Come, let us look anew at India which Swami Vivekananda had seen and let us put in practice the inherent strength of India realized by Swami Vivekananda. We possess everything within us, let us proceed with confidence.

My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that the 29th of August is celebrated as 'National Sports Day'. On this occasion, we are going to launch the 'Fit India Movement' across the country. We have to keep ourselves fit and the nation has to be made fit. It will be a very interesting campaign for everyone - children, the elderly, the young and women and it will be your own movement. But today I am not going to reveal its specifics; you must wait for 29thAugust!  I will tell you about 'Fit India Movement' in detail on 29thAugust and I am not going to forget connecting you with the movement because I want to see you fit! I want to make you aware about fitness and for a fit India, we should unite to set some goals for the country.

My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for your participation on 29th August in 'Fit India Movement', in ‘Poshan Abhiyaan’ during the month of September and especially in the 'Swachhata Abhiyan'  beginning from the 11th of September to the 2nd of October. And 2nd October as a day has been totally dedicated to riddance from plastic. All of us with all our might must try to get rid of plastics from our home and everywhere outside our houses. And I know that all these campaigns will make a big splash on social media. Come, let us proceed with a new zeal, new resolve and renewed strength.

My dear countrymen, this is all that this episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in store for you today. I shall be meeting you later. I will wait for your say and your suggestions. Come, let us all march together to make the India which was dreamt of by our freedom fighters and realize Gandhi's dreams - 'Swantah: Sukhayah'. Let us proceed, enjoying our inner bliss, expressing our spirit of service.

Many many Thanks.

Namaskar

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Indian community in Bahrain.

The PM said “My visit to Bahrain may be as the head of the government, as the Prime Minister, but my aim is  to meet the Indians settled here and communicate with millions of Bahraini friends. Today is the holy festival of Janmashtami. I have been told that there is still the tradition of narrating Krishna Katha on Janmashtami in the Gulf region. Tomorrow I will visit Shrinathji's temple and pray for the prosperity and peace of all of you and your host country”.

“I know how you and the devotees from India celebrated this occasion with reverence and gaiety. It is also a matter of happiness that tomorrow the redevelopment work of this temple will also be formally started”, PM added.

The PM said that there is immense goodwill  at Bahrain for Indians  for their  honesty, loyalty, ability and their contribution to the socio-economic life of Bahrain.  “You have made a place for yourself here with your hard work. We have to strengthen this Goodwill. Whenever I hear the praise of the Indian colleagues of the government here, the business people here, the people who settled here, the colleagues working here, my heart is filled with happiness”, the PM added.

PM said that today almost every family in India is connected to banking services. Mobile phones, Internet are within reach of normal family of India. The cheapest internet data in the world is in India. Efforts are being done so that most of the services in India could be digitally delivered.

PM added that every Indian has come to believe that India's dreams can be fulfilled, hopes and aspirations can be fulfilled. “Our goals are high, but when you have the arms of 130 crore people, you get encouragement. India is moving forward today, not only with the efforts of the government, but with the participation of crores of Indians. Government is at the steering only, it is the people of the country who are pressing the accelerator”, the PM said. 

He said that the facilities like BHIM app, UPI and Jan Dhan account have made banking in India accessible to the common citizens. Our Rupay card is now becoming a preferred medium of transaction all over the world. Now our Rupay cards are accepted by banks and sellers all over the world.

“I am glad that you will be able to transact in Bahrain soon with RuPay card. Today there is a MoU signed for use of RuPay card. Our intention is to provide you the facility to send money to your home in India through RuPay Card. Now you will be able to say that Bahrain - Pay with RuPay”, he added.

He said that in the last 5 years, it has been our endeavor that the head of crores of Indians living abroad, along with 130 crore Indians in the country, always remain high. Today, if India sees the world with respect, then the  big reason behind it are lakhs of companions like you.

Talking about developments in India, he said that India is moving towards ‘one nation one card’ for seamless mobility. Entire India is connected by ‘one nation one grid’ and ‘one nation one tax’ in the form of GST. India has put in place all the measures for Ease of Living and Ease of Business. All solutions are deviced in India,  by the youth of India. Indian youth is working with utmost sincerety to find ‘local solutions with global applications’. Indian talent is being recognised globally. It is working wonders in global projects and institutions. Indian scientists are being appreciated world over for achieving feat like Chandrayaan in such small budget. Such a quality is not only our advantage but our identity as well, that we don’t focus on budgets but willpower to achieve our goals.

The PM said, in 2022, India will complete 75 years of independence. I will  urge you to take some new resolutions at your level. You decide that every person, every year, will motivate some of their Bahraini friends for tour to India, to see beautiful hill stations to rich spiritual and cultural heritage of India. We have also taken a pledge to free India of single use plastic by 2022.

PM said “Let India and Bahrain work together towards our shared values and interests. India and Bahrain are modern nations with ancient civilisation. Both have immense potential. I have full confidence that my fellow Indians at Bahrain will strengthen this bond of relationship and possibilities to take India- Bahrain to new heights”.

The way you welcomed me made me feel like I am within India. I am overwhelmed with your love and affection and I bow down in front of you all.

I express my heartfelt gratitude to His Highness King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, to His Highness Prime Minister, to the Government of Bahrain, and to the people of this place for giving so much love and respect.

I realize that the Prime Ministers of India took too long to visit Bahrain. But I am fortunate to be the first Indian Prime Minister to come to Bahrain and receive your blessings. It seems that God has left a lot of work to be done by me.

Friends, 

While coming here on the stage, I could see the spectacular presentation of the cultural heritage of India; be it Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, every language of India was adorned with magnificent colours of unity, and unity in diversity. This diversity of India and these colours of Indianness are our strength. This iridescent image of India amazes and attracts the whole world.

Friends,

Although I have come here as the head of the government or as the Prime Minister, but my aim is to meet the Indians settled here and to communicate with lakhs of Bahraini friends. And I am trying to give freshness and modernity of 21st century to the five thousand year old relationships.

I want those relations that Sumer and Dilmun had with the Indus Valley should reach new heights in 21st century between India and Bahrain, and I am here before you as a partner for the same. I have come to invite lakhs of Bahraini friends towards new opportunities and new horizons in the New India of 130 crore dreams.

Sisters and brothers, 

Our relations with Bahrain have been about trade and business, but more than anything else, it has been about humanity, sentiments, culture and values. This connection of thousands of years has left its mark on both the countries.

I have had a very fruitful conversation with His Highness Prime Minister. Apart from further strengthening this strong cooperation between us, we have decided to improve our relationship in new areas such as space.

I am very excited to meet His Majesty, the King. I am very grateful to him for sending me the invitation. The societies of both countries have long received a lot from each other, especially our family values. The societies of both countries have given a lot of priority to it. We have considered a strong and a robust family system as the basis for empowerment of the society.

Friends, 

This day marks the auspicious festival of Janmashtami. My best wishes to you and to the Indian community spread across the world on Shri Krishna Janmotsav. I have been told that there is still the tradition of narrating Krishna Katha on Janmashtami in the Gulf region. Indians, especially Gujarat and Gujaratis have a special love and reverence for Lord Krishna.

Even today, the tradition of Rasleela commemorating Sri Krishna is followed in the villages of Gujarat. Bahrain has an old connection with Gujarat. So it is quite natural that Lord Krishna’s flute will echo in your heart and there is affection towards the king of Dwarka, Lord Krishna.

It is my privilege that tomorrow I will go to the temple of Srinath ji and pray for you and your host country's prosperity and peace. It is the oldest temple in this entire region. Recently, this temple f Srinathji has turned two hundred years old.

I know how you and the devotees from India have celebrated this occasion with reverence and joy. It is also a matter of great pleasure that the redevelopment work of this temple will formally start from tomorrow. This temple is a living reflection of the faith in you and is also a symbol of Bahrain's outstanding tradition of harmonizing diversity.

I have had conversations with many people there. And based on what I have seen and heard, I can say that Bahrain's society has kept the tradition of Indian faith very comfortable.

Friends, 

This has been possible because our relationship has not only been with the governments but also with the culture and the society. You have a major role in Bahrain's growth story. The soil here has given you, your dreams and the dreams of your loved ones a new flight, new wings and new opportunities.

Whenever I hear praises for the Indian friends, the business associates here, the people settled here and the friends who work here from the government here, my heart fills with joy.

Even today when His Highness, the Prime Minister of Bahrain was praising you so much about your efforts, your culture and behaviour, my heart swelled with pride.

There is a positive feedback regarding honesty, loyalty, workability of Indians and your contribution to the socio-economic life of this place. You have curved a niche for yourself here with your hard work. And the biggest thing is that you have created a place in the hearts of the people here. We have to strengthen this goodwill.

Friends, 

Now your contribution to the development of India is also commendable. Your hard work is also proving to be useful for your loved ones living in India; it is being used to raise the standard of living of your family.

Friends, 

Today, ease of living is our priority in India. In New India, no one should be deprived of his basic needs. Thus, many diverse steps are being taken for the same. Today when you talk to your family and relatives living in India, you can feel the change. I just want to ask you one thing. May I ask? Do you feel this change? Do you see the changing attitude of India? Sure?

Has the self confidence of India and Indians not increased? Are you living with your heads high or not? Are you able to talk eyeball to eyeball or not? This is happening because in the last five years, the emphasis has been laid on making the lives of ordinary citizens easier.

We have taken the initiative to provide electricity, gas connection and every such basic facility for crores of poor families of the country. Today almost every family in India is connected with banking. Mobile phone, internet is accessible to the common family of India. India provides the cheapest internet data in the world. Today, efforts are being made to make the delivery of most of the services in India digitally. Social security is also being provided to the families.

Be it insurance or pension – these are being made available to the poorest of the poor at a very nominal premium. Moreover, arrangement has been made to provide free treatment up to five lakh rupees to about 50 crore Indians. 

Friends, 

This is the change due to which 130 crore Indians have given us an opportunity to serve you once again by electing this government with a greater mandate than before. Every Indian has believed that India's dreams, hopes and aspirations can be fulfilled and resolutions can be achieved. This servant of India, on the basis of the same belief, is busy accomplishing the new resolutions. Our goals are high, but when you have the support of 130 crore people, then you get more encouragement.

India is moving forward today, not only with the efforts of the government but with the participation of crores of Indians. And friends, I am not hesitant to say this. And I want to bow my head and say that the government is just on the steering, while the enthusiasm and courage of the people of the country are the accelerators.

Friends, 

India has now decided that in the coming five years, she will try to double the size of the economy and turn it into a five trillion dollar economy. Today we have placed a target in front of us. For us, five trillion dollar economy is not just a figure but a means of empowering the common Indian. If the economy doubles, the income of every Indian household will also increase. The purchasing power of the most ordinary citizen will also increase.

Brothers and sisters, 

We have the potential and a plan to reach this target of five trillion dollars and we are fully prepared to sweat it out. We have not yet started the work to achieve this goal but have built a strong foundation in the last five years. Today India is making extensive improvements in every Global Ranking. India has also improved the ranking of the World Intellectual Property Organization's Global Innovation Index, the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economy Forum, and India has also improved its ranking among the Ten FDI Destinations listed by UNCTAD.

In Ease of doing business, we also aim to be in the top 50 countries. As a result of this, Foreign Direct Investment is flowing into India at a record level today. I am sure our friends from Bahrain will also be keener to take advantage of this unprecedented investment environment in India.

Friends, 

Today, unprecedented work is being done in the field of physical and digital infrastructure in India. Roadways, Highways, Railways, Airways, Waterways, I-ways are being laid. A target of investing Rs 100 lakh crore has been set in the country's infrastructure sector in the coming five years.

Talking about digital infrastructure, today India is one of the most digitally connected countries in the world with the provision of mobile phones and Aadhaar. Now work is being done to provide broadband connectivity in every gram panchayat of the country at a rapid pace. Work is also being done at different levels for 5G connectivity in the country. We have a huge and extensive treasure trove of data.

The Indian model of digital transaction is now being discussed all over the world. All of you have also been one of the greatest beneficiaries of the digital revolution in India. You all must have experienced how difficult it was to talk to your family, your relatives and to send money there till five years ago. Now you can do all these things very easily.

Facilities like Bhim App, UPI and Jan-Dhan accounts have made banking in India accessible to the common man. Our RuPAY card is now becoming a preferred mode of transaction all over the world. Banks and sellers across the world are now accepting our RuPAY card.

I am glad that you will be able to transact in Bahrain soon with the RuPAY card. Today MoU has been signed for the use of RuPAY card here and this will give you the facility of cashless transaction, but we further intend to ensure that you can send money to your home in India through RuPay card so that the cost of sending money is reduced and the transaction is also secured. Now you can also ask your friends from Bahrain to make payments with RuPAY card.

Friends, 

Till some time ago rupee was used here. Rupee was in circulation here. Now a few days later the RuPAY card will start circulating here.

Brothers and sisters, 

RuPay Card is one of the systems in India that is providing seamless connectivity to the entire country. Today, India is moving towards one nation one card for seamless mobility. Today there is one nation one grid for power supply across India and One nation one tax in the form of GST for entire India.

There are many arrangements that are being made to make life and business in India easier. The important thing is that all these solutions are being provided in India itself by the Indian youth. Today, India is working seriously on this concept of 'local solution for global application'.

Friends, 

India has shown its power to the world. Today India's talent is becoming a global identity of India. It is doing such wonders for India as well as the world that everyone is surprised. In big projects of the world, in the research of future related technologies, and in major institutions of the world Indians are showcasing their talent.

At the same time, new dimensions of success are being created one after another in India. You all know that India's Chandrayaan is going to land on the lunar surface on September 7th. The entire world is discussing India's space missions today. The capabilities of our ISRO scientists and our engineers are being praised all over the world.

The world is surprised as to how we are able to achieve such results only on the basis of our skill, efficiency and discipline with such a limited budget. Actually this is our strength and this is our advantage. We rely on unmatched will, not just budget. This unmatched will helps us to achieve big goals.

Brothers and sisters, 

The nation is made up of proudly held heads, not just borders. In the last five years, we have tried to ensure that the 130 crore Indians within the country and crores of Indians living abroad, will always keep their heads high. Lakhs of Indians like you are a strong link between India's relations with the world. Today, lakhs of friends like you are one of the greatest reasons that the world looks up to India with respect. I assure you that the way the Government of India has stood by you in your good and bad times; it is ready to serve you with full strength in the future too.

Friends, 

Our independent India will become 75 years old by the year 2022. Every Indian has taken several resolutions for this important occasion. I will urge you also to take some new resolutions at your level. For example, you can decide that every person, every year will motivate some of his/her Bahrain friends for India tour. You will show them everything from the beautiful hill stations of India to its rich spiritual and cultural heritage. Also discuss with your Bahraini friends about India's quality medical and meditation tourism.

This year is very important anyway. This year Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated. Although this festival will be celebrated all over the world including Bahrain, but what could be a better place than India to connect with Gandhiji in the true sense?

Friends, 

We will be able to fulfill our responsibilities towards India properly only when we are connected whole heartedly with the resolutions of Bahrain. I was told that His Highness and the young citizens here have started a campaign to clean their seas. I appeal to all of you to participate actively in this campaign.

In India too, we have launched a successful and comprehensive campaign on cleanliness. Now India has decided that by the year 2022, she will be liberated from single use plastic.

Moreover, a massive mission has been started to save water and to bring water to every house. You can also participate actively in this campaign. You can take the initiative to revive and adopt the wells, step-wells, ponds and lakes of your ancestral village with which you and your parents' childhood memories are associated.

Friends, 

If we work for the common interests and common values ​​of Bahrain and India, then our historical relations will definitely touch new heights in the 21st century. Both India and Bahrain are ancient civilizations but modern nations with full of potential. I am sure that lakhs of Indian ambassadors like you will give more strength to this strong thread of relationship.

Friends, 

I am a duty bound person. On one hand, Bahrain is full of excitement and enthusiasm. The country is celebrating Janmashtami, the birth of Lord Krishna. But at the same time, I am amidst you in a deep mourning and pain. Since the time we were students, the friend with whom I have spent my public life and have moved step by step in the political journey together, with whom I was connected to every moment, fighting together, dreaming together and fulfilling those dreams, that friend with whom we have made such a long journey together, that friend, Arun Jaitley, the former Defence Minister, Finance Minister of India, has passed away today. I cannot believe that I am so far away and one of my friends is gone.

I am in a lot of agony, pain and sorrow. A few days ago our former External Affairs Minister Sister Sushma has left us in the same month, and today my friend Arun is no more. This is a very tough time for me. On the one hand I am bound by duty, on the other hand, my heart cries for my loving friends; I am overwhelmed with emotions. I pay my respectful tribute to brother Arun from the land of Bahrain today and bow down to him. God bless his family in this moment of grief. I pray for him. Once again, I thank my dear brothers and sisters of Bahrain for giving me the opportunity to come here and interact with you. I express my heartfelt gratitude to you.

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Thanks a lot!

Namaskar to all!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of former finance minister and BJP stalwart Shri Arun Jaitley.

“Arun Jaitley Ji was a political giant, towering intellectual and legal luminary. He was an articulate leader who made a lasting contribution to India. His passing away is very saddening. Spoke to his wife Sangeeta Ji as well as son Rohan, and expressed condolences. Om Shanti.

 Full of life, blessed with wit, a great sense of humour and charisma, Arun Jaitley Ji was admired by people across all sections of society. He was multi-faceted, having impeccable knowledge about India’s Constitution, history, public policy, governance and administration.

During his long political career, Arun Jaitley Ji held multiple ministerial responsibilities, which enabled him to contribute towards India’s economic growth, strengthening our defence capabilities, creating people friendly laws and enhancing trade with other nations.

BJP and Arun Jaitley Ji had an unbreakable bond. As a fiery student leader, he was at forefront of protecting our democracy during the Emergency. He became a much liked face of our Party, who could articulate the Party programmes and ideology to a wide spectrum of society.

With the demise of Arun Jaitley Ji, I have lost a valued friend, whom I have had the honour of knowing for decades. His insight on issues and nuanced understanding of matters had very few parallels. He lived well, leaving us all with innumerable happy memories. We will miss him!”, the Prime Minister said.

                Distinguished citizens of France,

And my friends here who have enhanced the pride of India
and France, greetings to all of you!
Bon Jour, 

Brothers and sisters,

Friendship of India and France is absolutely unbreakable and this friendship is not new, it is centuries old. There is no such occasion or global forum where our countries have not supported each other and have not worked together. So today, this day is dedicated to this friendship. 

Friends, 

A good friendship means that we support each other in happiness and sorrow, whatever the situation may be. When there is any good achievement in India or France, we are happy for each other. I think that the number of supporters of the French football team in India will probably be more than those in France. When France won the Football World Cup, it was celebrated in India as well with great gusto. 

Friends, 

Similarly, we stand with each other in the moments of sorrow also. An example of this is also this memorial of two Air India plane accidents in France. Many Indian passengers died in these accidents. One of the greatest scientists of India, Dr. Homi Jahangir Bhabha was one of them. I pay my respects to that great son of India and other Indians who lost their lives in this accident. 

Friends, 

Every stone in this Memorial is a symbol of our citizens' sensitivity to each other. We salute the guides of Saint-Gervais who helped in the discovery of the plane wreck after the accident. I had the opportunity to contact the families of those guides. I am grateful to those guides and their family members. I thank the Mayor of Saint-Gervais who played a very important role in the construction of this memorial. I express my gratitude to the Government of France, President Macron and the people of France for inviting me and I also thank you for giving me the opportunity to meet you all. 

Friends, 

When I came to France 4 years ago, I got the opportunity to communicate with thousands of Indians here. I remember that I had made a promise to you then. I had said that India is about to embark on a new journey of hopes and aspirations. Today, when I am here among you, I can say that we not only embarked on that journey, rather with the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians, India is moving forward on the path of development at a great pace. This is the reason that once again the countrymen have supported our government by giving a more powerful mandate than before. This mandate is not just for running a government, but for building a new India. A new India whose rich civilization and culture is pride of the whole world, and which leads the modernism of the 21st century as well. A new India that focuses on Ease of Doing Business and which also ensures Ease of Living. 

Friends, 

There have been many positive changes in the last five years in India. India's youth power, villages, poor, farmers, and feminine power have been at the center of these changes. I have come to football loving country, and I am here in the midst of football lovers, then I want to say something in the language of football. You guys know very well what the importance of a goal is. In the last five years, we have scored some goals which were previously considered as impossible. But with the team spirit, we have been able to secure and realize those goals. 

Friends, 

If the maximum number of bank accounts are opened in a country in a given time all over the world, then it is in India. If the biggest health insurance scheme of the whole world is running in any country today, then it is in India. The number of people covered in this scheme is so huge that if you add the entire population of America, Canada and Mexico, even that number will be less in its comparison. 

Friends,

Whole world has set a target to eradicate TB by 2030. You will be proud that with the speed at which we are working on it, India will achieve this target by the year 2025. Similarly, the targets for climate change which were set in COP-21 to be achieved in 2030, India will achieve most of them in the next one and a half years. 

Friends, 

Today many studies are coming in which it is being said that India is eradicating its poverty at a fast pace. This was also one of our goals, which we are pursuing fast. India is full of new energy today and it is signified in the fact that India is also very ahead in the world of start-ups. Talented youth of small towns are making great innovations one after another. 

Friends,

It is also true that in the last five years we have also given red cards to many evils from our country. Today, the way things like corruption, nepotism, the loot of public money, and terrorism are being controlled in the new India that has never happened. 

Friends, 

There is no question of being tired or stopping in the new India. It has been only 75 days after the formation of the new government, but many big decisions have been taken inspired by the mantra of clear policy and right direction. As soon as the new government was formed, a new ministry was created for hydro power, which will holistically look at all the topics related to water. It was also decided to provide pension facilities to poor farmers and traders. The inhuman practice of triple divorce has been abolished. How can one accept such injustice with our Muslim sisters and daughters? Similarly the government has also taken important decisions in the area of Child Protection and Health. Today a lot of discussion is there also that this time the session of our Parliament was the most productive one in the last six decades. You all know that our Chandrayaan is going to land on the moon on 7th September. After this achievement, India will become the fourth country in the world to land on the moon. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Amid this progress happening in India, our centuries-old relations with France have strengthened day by day. Attention to each other's needs, sensitivity towards each other, we have moved forward with confidence in each other. India and France, they have fought for each other and have lived for each other also. Both the countries have fought the shoulder to shoulder with the enemies. This is the land where 9,000 Indian soldiers, with the French soldiers, sacrificed their lives fighting for humanity in the First World War. 

Friends, 

We have fought Imperialism, Fascism and Extremism not only in India but also on the soil of France. Our friendship is built on solid ideals. The character of both countries is built on the shared values of 'Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.' Today, if India and France are closely cooperating in fighting the great threats of the world, then the reason for this is our shared values only. Whether it is terrorism or climate change, we have accepted our collective responsibility to protect the values of democracy from these threats. Another feature of Indo-French relations is that we face challenges with concrete action. There is a lot of talk of climate change in the world, but little action is seen about them. With France we started the initiative of the International Solar Alliance. Today, around 75 countries have joined this and the ISA is bringing real change on the ground against climate change. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Nowadays we talk about the infra (INFRA) of 21st century. IN plus FRA i.e. synergy and alliance of INDIA and FRANCE: From Solar Infra to Social Infra, From Technical Infra to Space Infra, From Digital Infra to Defence Infra. The Alliance of India and France is moving ahead very strongly. Both countries are also benefiting from the construction of smart urban systems and participation in the intelligent transportation in India. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Indian Scientists in France, and French Technology in India is highly respected. Many of you are representing India's scientific talent in France, and are linked to the signature projects of both countries in atomic energy, aero-space technologies and other high tech areas. Indian talent is also a partner in the project to build the world's only fusion reactor in France. It is a very important scientific project of this century. When this technology will provide immense energy for generations to come, then your contribution will also be there in that. Imagine, how proud every Indian will be! 

Friends, 

Your relationship with India is that of soil, while with France it is of hard work. Your successes are not only a matter of pride for France, but it also makes India proud. People of Indian origin have also performed well in French public life. Many are members of the French Parliament. When Indian talents receive honors from France, we are also filled with pride. I am also happy that you have retained your distinct 'Indianness' while successfully adopting the French customs and laws. I am told that the Ganpati Festival has become the main feature of the Parisian cultural calendar. On this day, Paris transforms into mini India. Which means, a few days from now, the echo of ‘Ganpati Bappa Morya’ will also be heard here. My best wishes are with you. Tomorrow, it is also the holy festival of Janmashtami. I also greet all of you for this occasion. 

Friends, 

This year we are also going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. I hope that some of you must have participated in the Gandhi Quiz also. 

Brothers and sisters,

Your contribution for the development of the country is a great power for India. It is not the governments only at the root of the strong India-France relations, rather partners like you. Only you are the representatives and the voice of India in France. I am sure that you will continue to elevate this voice of India. Once again thank you very much! 

Long live Mother India!!!
Jai Hind!!!

                1. The Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi, visited France for an official visit at the invitation of the President of the French Republic, Mr Emmanuel Macron, for a Bilateral Summit on 22nd and 23rd August 2019 in Paris and to participate in the G7 Summit, on 25th and 26th August 2019, in Biarritz, under the French presidency of the G7.

2. India and France became strategic partners in 1998 and this traditional relationship is enduring, trustworthy, like-minded, and all-encompassing. India- France relations are marked by mutual trust between two strategic partners who have always stood by each other. This relationship developed into a structured partnership, both at bilateral level as well as in international bodies. France and India have decided to give a new ambition to this partnership by opening it to new areas of cooperation.

3. Both Sides noted that there has been positive progress in the development of bilateral trade and economic relations between their countries. They reaffirmed that the India-France Administrative Economic and Trade Committee (AETC) provides an appropriate framework to assess and find ways to further promote the bilateral trade and investment as well as to speed up the resolution of market access issues to the benefit of economic operators. In this regard, it was decided to further jointly strengthen work on solving trade and investment issues of concern for the French and Indian companies, including by additional ways and mechanisms. Leaders jointly agreed that the high-level France-India economic and financial dialogue should be reactivated as quickly as possible.

4. Directly in line with the Joint Vision adopted during the State Visit to India of President Macron in March 2018, France and India desire to deepen their space cooperation so as to meet new challenges together, whether it concerns planetary exploration or human spaceflight. France and India thus welcome the decision to train medical support personnel for Indian astronauts, who will be part of India’s manned space mission by 2022. The training will be carried out in France and in India. The leaders welcomed signing of an Implementing Arrangement for establishment of a framework for the realization of joint maritime domain awareness mission. They also hailed the launch of a Space Climate Observatory that further enhances Indo-French cooperation on combating climate change, besides TRISHNA joint mission and accommodating Argos in Oceansat 3. In an increasingly threatened environment, they have also resolved to act together at the international level to promote norms and best practices necessary for guaranteeing the safety of space missions.

5. In the digital space, the two countries support economic and social development through an open, secure and peaceful cyberspace, in which the international law applies. To this end, the two leaders have adopted a cybersecurity and digital technology road map aimed at expanding Indo-French bilateral cooperation, particularly in the strategic sectors of high performance computing and Artificial Intelligence, with the target of bringing our start-up ecosystems closer to each other.They further welcomed the signing of the Cooperation Agreement between the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing and Atos aiming at developing the cooperation in the fields of quantum computing, Artificial Intelligence and exascale supercomputing.

6. The two leaders expressed satisfaction at the progress in negotiations between NPCIL and EDF since the conclusion of the Industrial Way Forward Agreement between the two parties in 2018 for the construction of six nuclear power reactors in India in Jaitapur, Maharashtra. They also noted that discussions are underway on the Techno Commercial Offer and the financing of the project as well as on how to increase localization through manufacturing in India and enhance common understanding on the CLND Act between the two Sides. Both parties reaffirmed that they were resolved to actively pursue discussions for their early conclusion. They also welcomed the extension of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) concerning cooperation with the Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP) in January 2019 for another five years, the signing of the Implementing Agreement between the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and the CEA on the safety of Light Water Reactors (LWR) in September 2018. They also commended the joint partnership in International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactors (ITER) and European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) projects.

7. The bilateral cooperation is notably forged on an ambitious partnership in the defence sector. Hailing the success of the 2019 editions of the Varuna naval and the Garuda air exercises, as well as the preparations for the Shakti exercise, which will be held in autumn in India, France and India are determined to further strengthen the cooperation between their armed forces and in this connection are working towards increased interoperability as well as pursuing deliberations to develop joint forces cooperation. The signing of Agreement regarding the Provision of Reciprocal Logistics Support is a manifestation of this endeavour.

8. Defence industrial cooperation is one of the mainstays of the strategic partnership between India and France. The Prime Minister of India and the President of the French Republic noted with satisfaction the progress made in the implementation of agreements signed, particularly the delivery of the first Rafale combat aircraft from this year. They reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen cooperation in defence industry field and extended their support to existing and upcoming partnerships between the defence companies of the two countries in the spirit of ""Make in India” and for the mutual benefit of both countries. Both sides noted with satisfaction that Indian MSMEs are increasingly becoming part of global supply chains of French Defence and Aerospace OEMs and reaffirmed to give further impetus to this trend. They welcomed the ongoing collaboration between aerospace and defence industrial associations of both countries, SIDM for India and GIFAS for France.

9. France and India agreed to significantly enhance people-to-people contacts and cultural exchanges. It was agreed to set up a regular dialogue on consular matters, which will facilitate exchange and mobility. Welcoming Indian tourists in each other’s countries is a particular priority - 700 000 Indian tourists visited France in 2018, i.e. 17 % more than in 2017 and more than 250,000 French tourists visited India.

10. Education is an important area of cooperation. Both Sides expressed satisfaction on the status of student mobility between the two countries, which has been aided by the teaching of French in India and the creation of the network of schools for Excellence in French. The student exchange target of 10,000 set in 2018 will be fulfilled this year itself and therefore both sides decided to enhance the target to 20,000 students by 2025.

11. They welcomed the holding of the Second Knowledge Summit in Lyon, France, in October 2019. This summit helps structure academic and scientific partnerships with corporate entities on crucial issues, such as aerospace, renewable energy, green chemistry, smart cities, agriculture, marine sciences, and Artificial Intelligence. To enhance their cooperation on Skill Development, France and India signed a Memorandum of Understanding.

12. The leaders appreciated the strong potential of Indo-French cooperation in the field of culture which will be realised through participation in each other’s major cultural events. It was decided that India will be the Country of Honour for the 2020 edition of Livre Paris, the Paris international book fair; the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi will hold the first exhibition in India of French artist Gérard Garouste in January 2020; and the Musée national d’art moderne (Centre Georges Pompidou) will hold a dedicated exhibition of the works of Indian artist Sayed Haider Raza in 2021. India will organise Namasté France, in 2021-2022. The two countries will adopt a Plan of Action by the end of 2019 aimed at enhancing co-produced projects, distribution, and training in the fields of cinema, video games and virtual reality. France and India agreed to cooperate shooting of films in both countries.

13. Under the framework of their partnership for the planet, France and India reaffirmed their shared commitment to effectively combat climate change and loss of biodiversity.

14. Acknowledging the need for multi-level action – local, national, regional and global – France and India urged all stakeholders to contribute to the success of the Climate Action Summit convened by the United Nations Secretary General on 23rd September 2019 and to encourage the global efforts towards combating climate change. They reaffirmed their commitment to update their nationally determined contributions in a manner representing a progression beyond the current one and reflecting their highest possible ambition in line with principles of United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement including equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC).

15. India and France reaffirmed the importance of fulfilling the commitments under UNFCCC and the Paris Agreementand also urged all developed countries to scale up their contributions to Green Climate Fund in its first replenishment cycle in line with their commitments. Taking into consideration the goals of Paris Agreement and the recent findings of Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the impact of global warming at 1.5 degree Celsius with reference to pre-industrial levels as well as the IPCC Special Report on climate change and land, India and France, under European Union, will develop by 2020 their long-term strategies for low-GHG emission development, taking into account their Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities, in light of different national circumstances, and reflecting the highest possible level of national ambition, in line with Paris Agreement.

16. Under the framework of the G7 Summit in Biarritz and the United Nations Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit on 23rd September 2019, France and India will also support new initiatives aimed towards low-GHG development resilient to climate change notably through financial flows alignment with the Paris Agreement objectives and supporting transition towards lower emissions of high emitting industries. The two countries thus commit to working together to encourage the ratification and implementation of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on the reduction of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and promote improved energy efficiency standards in the refrigeration sector, supporting notably the ""Biarritz Pledge for Fast Action on Efficient Cooling” as would be adopted. France and India reiterate their commitment made during the G20 Summit to medium term rationalisation and phasing out of Inefficient Fossil Fuel Subsidies, while providing targeted support for the most vulnerable, and together participate in a peer review.

17. The two countries reaffirmed their joint commitment to accelerate development and deployment of renewable energy. They noted with satisfaction the progress made by the International Solar Alliance so far in capacity building and sharing of best practices to harness solar energy among the member nations. Both countries appreciated the implementation of Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and welcomed the progress achieved by the World Bank and the French Development Agency in Solar Risk Mitigation Initiative (SRMI) projects for enhancing investors’ confidence. While welcoming signing of Agreement between NISE and CEA in the field of hydrogen energy, they decided to further deepen their technological cooperation in the field of renewable energy. In line with this decision, India and France, which are contributing to the process of sustainable development of Africa, desired to cooperate to implement joint projects in the continent. Discussions are ongoing for the tripartite projects, particularly on the issues of solar irrigation and rural development in African countries and on developing skills through vocational training to sustain the development of the solar photovoltaic sector in Chad.

18. In the face of biodiversity erosion, and in line with the Charter on Biodiversity that will be endorsed in the Biarritz G7 Summit, France and India will actively work towards giving an impetus to new international, regional, national and local commitments in view of the major international events of 2020, notably the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Marseille and the COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Recalling that the successful implementation of the future Global Biodiversity Strategy, contributing to achievement of the three objectives of the Convention, is dependent on resource mobilisation, they desired financial resources commensurate with the challenges, along the lines of the 2012 Hyderabad Target for increasing the flow of international financial resources allocated for biodiversity in developing countries.

19. India and France agreed that oceans play an important role in combating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and development, and, acknowledging the link between environment and security, decided to enlarge the scope of their maritime cooperation to address these issues. For a sustainable use of marine resources, the Sides will work towards ocean governance, including through coordination in relevant international bodies. Blue Economy and coastal resilience are a common priority for India and France. In this regard, both Sides agreed to explore the potential for collaboration in marine science research for a better understanding of oceans, including the Indian Ocean.

20. In the run-up to the 14th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which will be held from 2nd to 13th September 2019 in New Delhi, and the 25th anniversary of the Convention signed in Paris in June 1994, France and India recalled the urgent necessity of sustainably transforming the use of Mother Earth. They desired to contribute to land restoration measures so as to fight poverty, inequalities and food insecurity on the one hand, and prevent and attenuate climate change and preserve or restore biodiversity. These measures could be based on the recommendations of IPBES special report on land degradation and restoration and its global assessment on biodiversity, as well as the IPCC special report on climate change and land adopted in Geneva in August 2019.

21. In this spirit, India and France intended to promote the initiative set up by the G7 Environment Ministers in Metz for the development of sustainable networks for supplying agricultural products to combat deforestation, notably from the environmental viewpoint through recognised certifications.

22. The two leaders reiterated their strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including cross-border terrorism and terror-related incidents in France and India. Both leadersreaffirmed that terrorism cannot be justified on any grounds whatsoever and it should not be associated with any religion, creed, nationality and ethnicity.

23. Recalling the joint statement on terrorism adopted by the two countries in January 2016, the two leaders reaffirmed their strong determination to eliminate terrorism wherever it is to be found and urged the international community to strengthen the efforts to counter and prevent terrorist financing. They called upon all UN member countries to implement the UNSC Resolution 2462 on Fighting Terrorist Financing adopted last March 28 and welcomed the organization in Melbourne on November 7-8 of a new ""No Money for Terror” International Conference on Fighting Terrorist Financing, which will build on the April 2018 Conference organized in Paris by the French Government and the Paris Agenda. Both the leaders agreed to work for early convening of the Global Conference, proposed by India, to tackle the threat of terrorism around the world.

24. They also called upon all countries to work together for rooting out terrorist safe havens and infrastructure, disrupting terrorist networks and their financing channels, and halting cross-border movement of terrorists belonging to Al Qaeda, Daesh/ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Tayabba, and their affiliates as well as terrorist groups threatening peace and security in South Asia and the Sahel region.

25. The two leaders, in addition to pursuing the excellent cooperation between the nodal agencies and the investigation agencies of the two countries, agreed to enhance their operational cooperation and launch fresh efforts to prevent and fight radicalization, especially Online Radicalization.

26. The two leaders reaffirmed their support for the implementation of the Christchurch Call to Action to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist online content adopted in Paris last May 15. Theyagreed to strengthen counter-terrorism efforts in Multilateral Fora such as UN, GCTF, FATF, G20 etc. They called upon all UN member countries to implement the UNSC Resolution 1267 and other relevant resolutions designating terrorist entities. The leaders also agreed to work together on early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) in the UN.

27. Based on a shared commitment to maintaining the freedom of navigation, particularly in the Indo-Pacific zone, maritime security cooperation between France and India is a domain of excellence in their strategic partnership. In this regard, France and India welcomed the swift implementation of the conclusions of the Joint Strategic Vision of India-France Cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region, adopted during the State Visit to India of President Macron in March 2018.

28. For the implementation of the White Shipping agreement, India and France welcome the appointment of a French liaison officer at the Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) in Gurugram.

29. France and India intend to coordinate their action at the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and undertake, along with interested States, a joint project for reinforcing assets for combatting piracy and all kinds of maritime trafficking in the Southern Indian Ocean. France also intends to work concertedly with India at the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), over which it will preside from 2020 to 2022.

30. France and India are democratic societies committed to upholding multilateralism. They believe more than ever before in a reformed, more efficient international system adapted to meet the challenges of the 21stcentury. Hence, France wished to associate India to the G7 Summit so as to better respond to the challenges of digital transformation, the climate emergency and the erosion of biodiversity. France and India call for reform of the United Nations Security Council that would enable India to gain a permanent seat on it. They also reaffirmed their commitment to working expeditiously and constructively, together and with others, towards the modernisation of the World Trade Organization, including in the lead-up to the 12th Ministerial Conference in June 2020. They agreed that updating the rules and improving the functions of the Organisation, with a particular focus on the dispute settlement system, is necessary to bolster the open, fair, transparent and rules-based multilateral trading system which has long been a significant engine of growth and development. They supported the implementation of the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment. Further, they cooperate under the Paris Club, the main international forum for restructuring official bilateral debts.

31. Aware that the European Union brings added value to this bilateral relationship, France and India reaffirmed their determination to deepen the relations between the EU and India on strategic and multilateral issues as well as in trade, investment and innovation.

32. France and India cooperate actively for international peace and security, including in the regional crises threatening them. They support an inclusive peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan which is Afghan led, Afghan owned and Afghan controlled, leading to a lasting political solution based on the preservation of the gains, including the constitutional order, human rights, particularly women’s rights and the liberties gained over the past eighteen years. They call for timely holding of Presidential elections; cessation of terrorist violence; and end to terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries for enduring and sustainable peace, security and stability in Afghanistan.

33. France and India agreed that full compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian Nuclear Programme and the UN Security Council Resolution 2231 was needed to ensure regional and international peace and security and that current issues need to be resolved peacefully through dialogue, including through efforts towards de-escalation of ongoing tensions.

34. Expressing satisfaction at the level of the existing engagement, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen their partnership with the objective of arriving at an even more robust, close and complementary relationship including synergising of their approaches towards issues of regional and global importance.

                Your Excellency, President Emmanuel Macron,
Respected delegations from India and France,
Friends,
Bon Jour,
Namaskar,

First of all, I express my heartfelt thanks to my close friend President Macron. He welcomed me and my delegation to this historic heritage site with a very grand and very affectionate welcome. This is a memorable moment for me. President Macron's invitation to the G7 Summit is an example of the strategic partnership between India and France and his friendly gesture towards me. Today we had very detailed discussions and the agenda of the G7 Summit, which is headed by France, should be a complete success and it is India’s resolve to extend the cooperation that is expected from India in this regard. Be it biodiversity, climate change, or the issues of cooling and gas, for centuries India has been advocating to live in a cultured way with traditions and in harmony with the nature. Destruction of nature can never be beneficial for human welfare and when it is the theme of this G7 Summit then it is a moment of even more happiness for India.

Friends,

India and France have centuries old relations. Our friendship is not based on any selfish reasons but on the solid ideals of 'Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.’ This is the reason why India and France have shoulder to shoulder protected freedom and democracy and combated fascism and extremism. The sacrifice of thousands of Indian soldiers during the First World War is still remembered in France. Today France and India stand firmly together to face the challenges of terrorism, climate change, environment and inclusive development of technology. Both our countries have not only spoken about good things, but we have also taken concrete steps. International Solar Alliance is one such successful initiative of India and France.

Friends,

For two decades, we have been on the path of strategic partnership. Today France and India are each other's trusted partners. During our difficulties, we have understood and supported each other's views. Friends,

Today, President Macron and I discussed all the aspects of our relationship in detail. It will be 75 years of India's independence in the year 2022, till then we have set many goals for the New India. Our main objective is to make India a $ 5 trillion economy. India's requirements for development present a golden opportunity for the French enterprises. We look forward to new initiatives in skill development, civil aviation, IT, space and many other areas to enhance our economic cooperation. Defense Cooperation is a strong pillar of our relationship. I am happy that we are making good progress on various projects. The first of the 36 Rafael aircrafts will be delivered to India next month. We will increase cooperation in technology and co-production. France is the first country with which we have signed the New Generation Civil Nuclear Agreement. We have urged our companies to rapidly move forward on the Jaitapur project and also keep in mind the price of electricity. It is also a matter of great pleasure that tourism is increasing from both sides. About 2.5 lakh French tourists and 7 lakh Indian tourists visit each other's country every year. The exchange of students in the field of higher education should be particularly increased. The next edition of the Indian cultural festival ""Namaste France"" will be held throughout France during 2021-2022. I hope that this festival will further deepen the interest of the people of France in the diverse culture of India. I know that Yoga is very popular in France. I hope that many more of my friends in France adopt it as a way of healthy lifestyle.

Friends,

I had pointed out the importance of cooperation between India and France for Global Challenges. Both our countries have to constantly face terrorism and radicalization. We have received valuable French support and cooperation in combating cross-border terrorism. We thank President Macron for this. We have intended to broaden cooperation on security and counter-terrorism. We have also decided to further strengthen our growing cooperation in maritime and cyber security. I am pleased that we have agreed on a new roadmap on cyber security and digital technology. Our operational cooperation in the Indian Ocean region is growing rapidly. This cooperation will be important in ensuring security and progress for all in the region.

Friends,

I wish my intimate friend President Macron, a successful leadership of G-7 and France with a new vision, enthusiasm and skill in these challenging times.

Excellency,

Complete cooperation and support of 1.3 billion Indians is with you in this endeavor. We both countries together can pave the way for a safe and prosperous world. I look forward to attending the G7 Summit in Biarritz and wish you and entire France many-many good wishes for the success of this summit. I once again express my gratitude for your affectionate invitation.

 

Thank you.
Merci beaucoup,
Au revoir.

                I will be visiting France, UAE and Bahrain during 22-26 August 2019.  

 

My visit to France reflects the strong strategic partnership, which our two countries deeply value, and share. On 22-23 August 2019, I would have bilateral meetings in France, including a summit interaction with President Macron and a meeting with Prime Minister Philippe. I would also interact with the Indian community and dedicate a memorial to the Indian victims of the two Air India crashes in France in the 1950s & 1960s.

 

Later, on 25-26 August, I will participate in the G7 Summit meetings as Biarritz Partner at the invitation of President Macron in the Sessions on Environment, Climate, Oceans and on Digital Transformation. 

 

India and France have excellent bilateral ties, which are reinforced by a shared vision to cooperate for further enhancing peace and prosperity for our two countries and the world at large. Our strong strategic and economic partnership is complemented by a shared perspective on major global concerns such as terrorism, climate change, etc.  I am confident that this visit will further promote our long-standing and valued friendship with France for mutual prosperity, peace and progress.

 

During the visit to the United Arab Emirates on 23-24 August, I look forward to discuss with His Highness the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, entire gamut of bilateral relations and regional and international issues of mutual interest.

 

I also look forward to jointly release the stamp to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi along with His Highness the Crown Prince. It will be an honour to receive the ‘Order of Zayed’, the highest civilian decoration conferred by the UAE government, during this visit. I will also formally launch RuPay card to expand the network of cashless transactions abroad.

 

Frequent high-level interactions between India and UAE testify to our vibrant relations. UAE is our third-largest trade partner and fourth-largest exporter of crude oil for India. The qualitative enhancement of these ties is among one of our foremost foreign policy achievements. The visit would further strengthen our multifaceted bilateral ties with UAE.

 

I will also be visiting the Kingdom of Bahrain from 24-25, August 2019.  This would be the first ever Prime Ministerial visit from India to the Kingdom. I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister His Royal Highness Prince Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the ways to further boost our bilateral  relations and share views on regional and international issues of mutual interest. I would also be meeting His Majesty the King of Bahrain Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and other leaders.

 

I would also take the opportunity to interact with the Indian diaspora. I will be blessed to be present at the formal beginning of the re-development of  the temple of Shreenathji- the oldest in the Gulf region – in the wake of the auspicious festival of Janmashtami. I am confident that this visit would further deepen our relationship across the sectors.

                The honourable Speaker of Lok Sabha, Shri Om Birla ji, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Shri Harivansh ji, my Cabinet Colleague Shri Prahlada Joshi ji, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri ji, Chairman of House Committee, Bhai C.R. Patil ji, Shri Om Mathur ji, all the MPs present here, all my Cabinet colleagues and all other dignitaries.

It is generally felt that when a new session begins, the MPs face a lot of inconvenience in terms of accommodation arrangements. Hotels have to be booked for a long time. And as soon as the houses are vacated, then those are repaired and renovated; and this cycle goes on. A thoughtful attempt has to be made to come out of it and to find out a way of developing systems permanently and to adapt to the changing times. MPs do not need more than one room for themselves, but the biggest part of their work involves people coming to them from their area in large numbers. People who come from far and wide places are concerned about their night stay here and people in public life know very well that whether there is a place available or not, we cannot turn them away.

Now it is very difficult for the outsiders to understand this problem and the MPs know the seriousness of the challenges. And so well thought out efforts have been made since the previous session. Another issue is that some buildings have become very old and these require some repairing every day. And as a result, it is inconvenient both for those who are making arrangements as well as for those who are staying there. Efforts are being made to find permanent solution to this issue. In the coming days, more buildings should be constructed quickly. If the government works through its own department in such a good way, then outsiders will be surprised that even the in-house work is done in such a brilliant way! So, I congratulate all the people of the department who did this work. Usually people associate government work with delays; people always ask about the delay or by when would it be completed or how much more time is needed? But it was completed before the stipulated time. Usually budget keeps on increasing in a Government work but it was done at a lower cost than the budget and quality was not compromised. Thus, time was saved, money was saved and care was taken for all the facilities there. I congratulate all the friends who have contributed to the construction of the building, and the government officials who have worked towards it.

This time we have seen that the Parliament has performed very well and the credit goes to all political parties, all the MPs and the Speaker. But a unanimous voice came from both the Houses. Both the Speaker and the Vice-President suggested that as the year 2022 that will mark 75 years of Indian independence is approaching, a few changes should also be made in our Parliament.

It is true and I have been hearing this from the MPs for the last five years. Even friends from media world keep saying that things have become too outdated now, some changes should be made. Modern facilities should be put in place and as the demand has come from the House itself, the government has taken it seriously. Officials are brainstorming on the issue as to how modern facilities can be put in place in the Parliament or if required possibility of constructing a new building. And I have requested them to be as quick as possible so that it can be finished by the 75th year of independence. Although very little time is left, but we should still try. Once again, I congratulate all the MPs for this new facility and wish them all the best.

Both leaders agreed that the tradition of regular high-level contacts between Bhutan and India is an important hallmark of the special and privileged relationship.

7. During the talks, both Prime Ministers comprehensively reviewed all aspects of the bilateral relationship, as well as other important regional and international developments. Both leaders expressed satisfaction at the excellent state of bilateral ties, which is based on mutual trust and respect, and underpinned by shared historical, cultural, economic, developmental and people-to-people linkages. In this context, both sides appreciated the role played by the visionary Monarchs of Bhutan and the successive leadership of India and Bhutan in nurturing the relationship as an outstanding example of friendship and co-operation between close neighbours.

Prime Minister Shri Modi congratulated the Government and the people of Bhutan for the Kingdom’s imminent graduation to the category of a Middle-Income country.

The two Prime Ministers formally inaugurated the recently completed 720 MW Mangdechhu Hydroelectric Plant. They appreciated the timely completion of this project, and congratulated the Project Authority and Management for their dedication and competence. Both sides noted that with the coming on stream of this Project, the jointly created generation capacity in Bhutan has crossed 2000 MW. The two leaders expressed their satisfaction on achieving this important milestone, and resolved to continue working together to expedite the completion of other ongoing projects such as Punatsangchhu-1, Punatsangchhu-2 and Kholongchhu.

The two Prime Ministers jointly released Bhutanese stamps commemorating five decades of mutually beneficial Indo-Bhutan cooperation in hydro-power sector.

12. The two Prime Ministers formally launched the facility of use of Indian-issued RuPay cards in Bhutan, which would greatly facilitate Indian travellers to Bhutan by reducing the need to carry cash, while at the same time boosting the Bhutanese economy and further integrating the economies of both countries. Both sides resolved to expeditiously work on the next phase of the project, i.e. issuance of RuPay cards by Bhutanese banks, which would benefit Bhutanese travellers to India and thus allow full inter-operability of RuPay cards in both countries. Along with the launch of RuPay, a feasibility study for use of India’s Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app in Bhutan was also agreed, to promote cashless payments between the two countries.

14. Recognizing the positive impact that the SAS would have on the socio-economic development of Bhutan, Prime Minister Shri Modi offered increased bandwidth on an additional transponder as per Bhutan’s requirements, as a gift to the people of Bhutan.

Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) reiterated its appreciation for the transitional Trade Support Facility of INR 4 billion offered by Government of India during Prime Minister Dr.Tshering’s visit to India in December 2018, to strengthen bilateral trade and economic linkages and thanked GoI for release of the first tranche of INR 800 million.

23. Prime Minister Shri Modi offered prayers at the historic SemtokhaDzong in Thimphu, which houses a statue of the revered ZhabdrungNgawangNamgyal, the founder of the Bhutanese state, which has been loaned to Bhutan by India.

                Your Excellency Dr. Lotay Tshering Prime Minister of Bhutan, Honourable Members of the National Assembly and the National Council of Bhutan, Distinguished Vice Chancellor and Faculty Members of the Royal University of Bhutan,

 

My young friends,

 

Kuzo Zangpo La. Namaskar. It is a wonderful feeling to be with you all here this morning. I am sure you are thinking- today is Sunday and you have to attend a lecture.  But, I will keep it brief and on topics that you would relate with.

 

Friends,

Anyone visiting Bhutan is struck as much by its natural beauty as by the warmth, compassion and simplicity of its people. Yesterday, I was at Semtokha Dzong, the fore-most example of the richness of Bhutan's past and the greatness of its spiritual heritage. During this visit, I have had the opportunity to interact closely with the present leadership of Bhutan. I once again received their guidance for the India-Bhutan relationship, which has always benefitted from their close and personal attention.

 

Now, today, I am here, with the future of Bhutan. I can see the dynamism, and feel the energy. I am confident that these will shape the future of this great nation and its citizens. Whether I look at Bhutan's past, present or future, the common and constant threads are - deep spirituality, and youthful vigour. These are also the strengths of our bilateral relationship.

 

Friends,

It is natural that the people of Bhutan and India experience great attachment to each other.  After all, we are close not just due to our geography. Our history, culture and spiritual traditions have created unique and deep bonds between our peoples and nations. India is fortunate to be the land where Prince Siddhartha became Gautam Buddha. And from where the light of his spiritual message, the light of Buddhism, spread all over the world. Generations of monks, spiritual leaders, scholars and seekers have burnt that flame bright in Bhutan. They have also nurtured the special bond between India and Bhutan.

 

As a result, our shared values have shaped a common world-view. This is visible in Varanasi and Bodh Gaya. And also in Dzong and Chorten. And as people, we are fortunate to be the living vehicle of this great legacy. No other two countries in the world understand each other so well or share so much. And no two countries are such natural partners in bringing prosperity to their peoples.

 

Friends,

Today, India is witnessing historic transformations in a wide range of sectors.

India is eliminating poverty faster than ever before. The pace of infrastructure construction has doubled in the last five years. We have just pledged about 15 billion dollars for next-generation infrastructure. India is home to the world's largest health-care programme, Ayushman Bharat that offers health assurance to 500 million Indians.

India has among the cheapest data connectivity in the world, which is directly and indirectly empowering millions. India is also home to among the biggest start-up eco-systems in the world. This is indeed a great time to innovate in India!  These, and many other transformations have the dreams and aspirations of the youth of India at their core.

 

Friends,

Today, I stand here among the best and brightest youth of Bhutan. His Majesty told me yesterday that he interacts with you regularly and had addressed the last convocation.  It is from you all that Bhutan's future leaders, innovators, business persons, sports persons, artists and scientists will emerge.

 

A few days back, my good friend, Prime Minister Doctor Tshering wrote a Facebook post that touched my heart. In that post he mentioned about Exam Warriors, and just now also a student mentioned about that book. Exam Warriors, a book I wrote about how to face exams without stress. Everyone faces exams in schools and colleges and also in the larger class-room of life. Can I tell you something? Much of what I wrote in Exam Warriors is influenced by the teachings of Lord Buddha. Particularly, the importance of positivity, over-coming fear and living in oneness, be it with the present moment or with Mother Nature. You are born in this great land.

 

Therefore, these traits come naturally to you and shape your personality. When I was young, the search of these traits took me all the way to the Himalayas! As children of this blessed soil, I am confident that you will contribute to finding solutions to the problems of our world.

Yes, we have challenges. But for every challenge, we have young minds to find innovative solutions to over-come them. Let no limitation constrain you.

I want to tell you all- there is no better time to be young than now! The world today offers more opportunities than ever before. You have the power and potential to do extra-ordinary things, which will impact generations to come. Find your real calling and pursue it with full passion.

 

Friends,

India-Bhutan cooperation in hydro-power and energy is exemplary. But the real source of power and energy of this relationship are our people. So, it is people first, and people will always be at the centre of this relationship. This spirit is clearly seen in the outcomes of this visit. Going beyond the traditional sectors of cooperation, we are seeking to cooperate extensively in new frontiers, from schools to space, digital payments to disaster management. Our cooperation in all these sectors will have a direct impact on young friends like you. Let me give some examples. In this day and age, it is crucial to connect scholars and academics beyond borders, so that creativity and talent of our students bring them at par with the best in the world. Cooperation between India’s National Knowledge Network and Bhutan’s DrukREN, which became a reality yesterday, will serve this purpose.

 

It will provide secure and fast connectivity between our universities, research institutions, libraries, health-care and agricultural institutions. I urge you all to make full use of this facility.

 

Friends, Another example is the frontiers of space. At this very moment, India’s second Moon mission, Chandrayaan-2 is on the way to the moon. By 2022 we intend to place an Indian in space, on an Indian space-craft. All these are the results of India’s own achievements. For us, the space programme is not just a matter of national pride. It is a vital instrument of national development and global cooperation.

 

Friends,

Yesterday, Prime Minister Tshering and I also inaugurated the Thimphu Ground Station of the South Asia Satellite and expanded our space cooperation. Through satellites, benefits of tele-medicine, distance education, resource mapping, weather fore-cast and even warning of natural disasters will reach even remote areas. It is even a matter of great happiness that young Bhutanese scientists will travel to India to work on designing and launching Bhutan’s own small satellite. I hope that someday soon, many of you will be scientists, engineers and innovators.

 

Friends,

For centuries, education and learning have been central to the ties between India and Bhutan. In ancient times, Buddhist teachers and scholars formed the bridge of learning between our peoples. This is a price-less heritage, which we wish to preserve and promote. Therefore, we welcome more students of Buddhism from Bhutan in institutions such as Nalanda University – a historical global seat of learning and Buddhist traditions, which is revived at the very place where it existed fifteen hundred years ago. The bond of learning between us is as modern as it is ancient. In the 20th century, many Indians came to Bhutan as teachers. Most Bhutanese citizens of older generations would have had at least one Indian teacher during their education. Some of them were honoured by His Majesty last year. And we are grateful for this generous and kind gesture.

 

Friends,

At any point, over four thousand students from Bhutan are engaged in studies in India. This number can and should grow. As we march forward to develop our countries, we also need to keep pace with ever-changing technological landscape. It is, therefore, Important that we collaborate in all areas of emerging technologies and education.

 

I am happy that yesterday we have begun new chapters of engagement between India’s premier IITs and this prestigious University. We hope that these will lead to more collaborative learning and research.

 

Friends,

In any part of the world, if we ask the question what do you associate with Bhutan, the answer will be the concept of Gross National Happiness. I am not surprised. Bhutan has understood the essence of happiness. Bhutan has understood the spirit of harmony, togetherness and compassion. This very spirit radiates from the adorable children who lined the streets to welcome me yesterday. I will always remember their smiles.

 

Friends,

 

Swami Vivekananda had said, “Every nation has a message to deliver, a mission to fulfill, a destiny to reach”. Bhutan's message to humanity is happiness. Happiness which springs from harmony. The world can do with a lot more happiness.  Happiness, which shall prevail over mindless hate. If people are happy, there will be harmony, where there is harmony, there will be peace. And it is peace that will help societies achieve progress through sustainable development. In a time where development is often seen in conflict with traditions and the environment, the world has much to learn from Bhutan.  Here, development, environment and culture are not at loggerheads but are in synergy. With the creativity, energy and commitment of our youth, our nations can achieve all that is required for a sustainable future –   whether it is water conservation or sustainable agriculture or making our societies free of single-use plastic.

 

Friends,

During my last visit to Bhutan, I had the privilege to visit the temple of democracy, the Parliament of Bhutan. Today, I have the honour to visit this temple of learning. Today, we also have in the audience Honourable Members of the Parliament of Bhutan. I especially thank them for their distinguished presence. Democracy and education both aim to set us free. Neither can be complete without the other. And both help us to achieve our fullest potential, and be the best we can. This seat of learning will once again set free our spirit of enquiry and will also keep the student within us alive.

 

As Bhutan soars high in these endeavours, your 1.3 billion Indian friends will not only just look on and cheer you with pride and happiness. But also they will partner you, share with you and learn from you. With these words, I would like to thank the chancellor of the Royal University of Bhutan His Majesty the King, the Vice Chancellor and the Faculty of the University, and all of you – my young friends.

 

You all have honoured me with your invitation and given me so much time, attention, and even more affection.  I go back with a lot of happiness and positive energy from you all.

 

Thank you very much.

 

Tashi Delek!

                His Excellency, Prime Minister of Bhutan,
And my friend Dr. Tshering,

Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Greetings,

I am very happy to be present among all of you here in Bhutan, an integral and special friend of India. Prime Minister, I sincerely thank you and the Royal Government of Bhutan for the very warm welcome accorded to me and my delegation.

Excellency,

My heartfelt gratitude also for your generous thoughts about this unique friendship of India-Bhutan. Bhutan holds a special place in the hearts of 130 crore Indians. During my last tenure, the selection of Bhutan was natural for my first visit as the Prime Minister. This time also, I am very happy to visit Bhutan at the beginning of my second term. The relations between India and Bhutan are based on the common interests of progress, prosperity and security of the people of both countries. And so they have full support of the people in both countries.

Excellency,

It is my privilege that the decisive mandate of the people of India has once again given me the opportunity to work with you, the King of Bhutan, to further strengthen these relations. Today I had the opportunity to discuss our partnership with His Majesty, the King of Bhutan. And after some time I will also meet His Majesty, The Fourth King of Bhutan. The intelligence and foresight of the Kings of Bhutan has guided our bilateral relations for a long time. Not only this, their vision has presented Bhutan, to the whole world, as a unique example where development is measured not by figures but by happiness. Where economic development moves along with tradition and environment. Who wouldn't want such a friend and neighbor.

Friends,

It is a privilege of India that we are a major partner in the development of Bhutan. India's cooperation in Bhutan's five-year plans will continue even further depending on their wishes and priorities.

Friends,

Hydro-power is an important area of ​​cooperation between our two countries. The two countries have together transformed the power of the rivers of Bhutan into not only electricity but mutual prosperity also. Today we have achieved another historic milestone of this journey with the inauguration of the Mangdechhu project. With the cooperation of both countries, hydro-power generation capacity in Bhutan has crossed 2000 MW. I am confident that we will also take other projects forward very fast.

Excellency,

To meet the growing needs of the common people of Bhutan, the supply of LPG from India is being increased from 700 to 1000 MT per month. This will help in bringing clean fuel to the villages.

Friends,

In our first meeting Dr. Tshering told me that his main motivation for joining politics has been to provide good health services to the common man. I was very impressed with his vision. India will extend all possible help in realizing his dream of multi-disciplinary super-specialty hospital in Bhutan.

Excellency,

Under the SAARC Currency Swap Framework, we are positive to increase the limit of currency swaps for Bhutan. Meanwhile, an additional $ 100 million will be available to Bhutan under the standby swap arrangement to meet the foreign exchange requirement.

Friends,

India is committed to accelerate the development of Bhutan using space technology. We have inaugurated the earth station of South Asia Satellite today. This will increase coverage of communication, public broad-casting and disaster management in Bhutan. For these purposes extra bandwidth and transponders will also be made available as per Bhutan's requirement. Both countries will also cooperate in the construction of small satellites and the use of space technology. Connection with the National Knowledge Network of India will connect Bhutan's students and researchers to the new resources of Indian universities. This is an important step for the establishment of a Common Knowledge Society between the two countries, which will particularly benefit our youth. The collaboration and relationship between Royal Bhutan University and IITs of India and some other top educational institutions are in line with today's requirements for education and technology. I am eagerly looking forward to meeting the talented youth of this country at the Royal Bhutan University tomorrow.

Friends,

I am very happy that today we have launched the RuPay card in Bhutan. This will further enhance our relationship in digital payments, and trade and tourism. Our shared spiritual heritage and strong people-to-people relationship is the heart of our relations. Keeping this in mind, post-graduate scholarships for Bhutan at Nalanda University are being increased from two to five. I have received the blessings of Zhabdrung here today. I am happy to announce that India has agreed to extend the presence of this unique statue in Bhutan for another five years.

Excellency,

The history of India-Bhutan relations is as glorious as its promising future. I believe that India and Bhutan will remain a unique model of relations between two countries in the world.

To give an opportunity to visit again this beautiful Druk Yul,

Once again many-many thanks for your welcome and your love.
Tashi Delak!

                Following is the text of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's departure statement prior to his visit to Bhutan.

“I will be on a State Visit to Bhutan on 17-18 August 2019.   

My visit to Bhutan in the beginning of the current term reflects the high importance that the Government attaches to India’s relations with Bhutan, our trusted friend and neighbour. 

India and Bhutan enjoy excellent bilateral ties exemplified by our extensive development partnership, mutually beneficial hydro-power co-operation, and strong trade and economic linkages.  These are, reinforced by a shared spiritual heritage and robust people-to-people ties. 

Both countries jointly celebrated the Golden Jubilee of the establishment of formal diplomatic relations last year.

India-Bhutan partnership today is of a special character and substance and forms an important pillar of Government of India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy. 

I look forward to having fruitful discussions with H.M. the King, H.M. the Fourth Druk Gyalpo and the Prime Minister of Bhutan on the entire gamut of our bilateral relations. I also look forward to addressing young Bhutanese students at the prestigious Royal University of Bhutan. 

I am confident that my visit will promote our time-tested and valued friendship with Bhutan and consolidate it further for the prosperous future and progress of the people of both our countries.”

                My dear countrymen,  

On this solemn day of Independence, many greetings to all countrymen.

Today is also the festival of Raksha Bandhan. This centuries-old tradition expresses the love of brother and sister. I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen and all the brothers and sisters on this auspicious festival of Raksha Bandhan. May this festival filled with affection fulfil the hopes, aspirations and dreams of all our brothers and sisters, and bring affection in their lives.

Today, while the country is celebrating the festival of independence, people in several parts of the country are facing difficulties due to floods and heavy rainfall. Many have lost their dear ones. I express my condolences to them. The State Governments, the Central Government and other organizations like NDRF are striving day and night to ease the hardships and bring the situation under control.

Today, when we are celebrating this auspicious day of Independence, I pay my respects to all those who gave up their lives, who spent their youth in prisons, who embraced the gallows, who instilled the spirit of non-violence through Satyagraha for the freedom of the country. The country gained independence under the leadership of Bapu. Similarly, in the years since independence numerous people have contributed for the peace, prosperity and security of the country. Today, I also salute the people who have contributed to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the people, for the development, peace and prosperity of Independent India.

After the formation of the new government, I am humbled once again with the opportunity to interact with you. It has not even been 10 weeks since the formation of this new Government. But even in a short ten-week period, efforts have been made in all fields and in every direction, new dimensions have been added. People have entrusted us to serve them so that they can achieve their hopes, expectations and aspirations. We are dedicated to your service with complete devotion, without wasting even a single moment.

To revoke Article 370 and 35A within 10 weeks is a significant step towards fulfilling the dream of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.

In just ten weeks, we made big ticket decisions like bringing about a law against Triple Talaq to protect the rights of our Muslim women, making major amendments in laws to counter terrorism and to make it more stringent and powerful; transfer of approximately 90,000 crores of rupees to the bank accounts of farmers who are beneficiaries of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana.

Our brothers and sisters from the farming community, our small entrepreneurs could never believe that they will ever be able to avail of pension schemes and live a dignified life even after they attain 60 Years, when they are physically weak and need some support. We have implemented a Pension Scheme to meet these needs.

Water crisis is a big concern these days. It is being predicted that an impending water crisis is staring us in the face. Anticipating such a situation, we have announced the formation of a new dedicated Ministry of Jal Shakti where the Centre and States will together develop schemes and policies to address issues of water crisis. 

Our country needs doctors in huge numbers along with robust health facilities. To fulfil this requirement we need new laws, upgraded infrastructure, new thinking and create new opportunities to motivate the youth to take up the medical profession. In view of this, we have formulated laws and taken important steps to bring transparency in Medical Education.

Now a days we come across incidents of child rights violation all over the world and India will not leave her children vulnerable. A much warranted stringent law to protect child rights was needed and has been enacted.

Brothers and sisters, you gave me an opportunity to serve you all for five years from 2014-2019. We took cognizance of the struggles faced by the common man to avail the basic facilities. Over the past five years, our government has been striving to provide the facilities to meet the daily needs of the common man. Special efforts have been made to facilitate those living in villages, and those who are poor, marginalized, victimized, exploited, deprived and tribals. We are working relentlessly in this direction to bring the nation back on track towards development. But times change. While 2014-2019 was a period of fulfilling your basic needs, the years from 2019 and beyond will see your aspirations and dreams getting fulfilled.

What should 21st Century India look like?How fast should it move? How extensively, should it work, what heights should it strive for- we are taking steps one after the other by preparing a roadmap for the next five years, keeping all these things in mind.In 2014, It was a new beginning for me. Prior to the election in 2013-2014, I travelled across the country and tried to understand the feelings of our countrymen. But everyone had disappointment written on their face, everyone had apprehensions.  People used to wonder if the country could change at all.  Can the country change with the change of Government? A sense of hopelessness had percolated into the minds of the common man. This was the result of their experience over a long period- hopes did not last long, they sank into the depths of despair very fast.But when in 2019, after five years of hard work, with only dedication to the common people, only my country in my heart, only my millions of countrymen in my heart - with this feeling we kept on moving, dedicated every moment for that. When we ran for the office again in 2019,  I was surprised. The Mood of the country changed. Despair had changed into hope, dreams got linked to resolutions, accomplishment was visible and the common man had only one determination that he can change his country. Yes it was the feeling that We too can change our country and that we cannot stay behind.

This feeling of the 130 crore citizens, this echoing of emotions gives us new the strength, new faith.

We had started with the mantra Sabka Saath- Sabka Vikas , but within five years, the countrymen have painted the entire mood of the nation with the color of Sabka Vishwas.  The Trust and confidence that everyone reposed in us over the last five years will inspire us to serve the nation with more vigour.

I have seen in the recent elections and I had felt then that this is an election in which no politician was contesting, no political party was contesting, neither Modi was contesting nor were friends of Modi contesting the election. It was the people of India who were contesting the election, 130 Crore countrymen were contesting the election. They were contesting for their own dreams. The real nature of Democracy could be seen in this election.

My dear countrymen, the solution to the problems - along with the period of dreams, determination and accomplishment - we have to walk together now. It is evident that sense of self-reliance develops when problems get solved. Solution to problems encourages speed of self-reliance. When self-reliance occurs, self-esteem develops  automatically and self-esteem has very strong potential. The power of self-respect is greater than anything and when there is a solution, resolution, capability, self-respect, then nothing can come in the way of success.

And today, with that self-respect we are determined to move forward to touch new heights of success. When we are trying to solve problems we should not think in isolation. There will be difficulties. Half-hearted efforts made with the aim of earning applause will not help in fulfilling the dreams of the country. We have to strive to remove problems from their roots.

You would have seen how our Muslim daughters and sisters used to live in fear with the sword of Triple Talaq dangling over their heads. Even if they were not victims of Triple Talaq, they were constantly haunted by the fear that they could be subjected to it anytime. Many Islamic countries abolished this evil practice long time back. But for some reason we were hesitant to give our Muslim mothers and sisters their due rights. If, we can abolish Sati Pratha, if we can enact laws to end female foeticide, if we can raise our voice against child marriage, if we can take strong steps against dowry system in this country, then why can’t we raise our voice against Triple Talaq? We have taken this important decision in the spirit of India’s democracy and constitution, to respect the thinking of Baba Saheb Ambedkar so that our Muslim sisters get equal rights; so that new confidence is generated in them; so that they also become active participants in the India’s development journey. Such decisions are not for political gains. They guarantee a lasting protection to our mothers and sisters.

Similarly, I will give another example. What was the reason behind revocation of Article 370 and 35A? This is the hallmark of this government. We do not avoid problems, nor do we let them fester. There is no time to delay or neglect problems. The work that was not done in the last 70 years has been accomplished within 70 days after this new government came to power. The abrogation of Article 370 and 35A has been carried out in both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha by two-thirds majority. This means that everyone wanted this decision, but perhaps they were waiting for somebody to initiate the same and carry it forward. I have come to accomplish the task assigned to me by my countrymen. I work selflessly. 

We are moving forward with re-organization of Jammu and Kashmir. For 70 years every government made efforts to do something.

But the desired results were not achieved, and when desired results are not achieved, there is a need to think afresh and take new steps. It is our responsibility to see that the aspirations of the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh get fulfilled.  It is our collective responsibility to give new wings to their dreams. This responsibility has to be shouldered by all 130 crore of my countrymen.  To meet this commitment we have made endeavours to remove whatever hurdles were there in the way.  

The system that prevailed over the past seventy years had aggravated separatism and given birth to terrorism.   It had encouraged dynastic rule and in a way strengthened the foundations of corruption and discrimination.  We have to make efforts so that the women of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh get their rights.  We have to make efforts so that my dalit brothers and sisters living there, get the rights which they have been deprived of so far.   The rights enjoyed by the tribal people of India must also be available to my tribal brothers and sisters of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.  There are several such communities, like Gujjars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, Sippies or Balties- all such communities must be empowered with political rights.  It is surprising that in Jammu & Kashmir there were legal restrictions on Safai Karamchari brothers and sisters. Their dreams were trampled upon.  Now, we have freed them from such shackles.  

When India was partitioned, crores of people had to leave behind their ancestral homes for no fault of theirs.  Those who settled down in Jammu & Kashmir got neither human rights, nor citizenship rights.  There are people from hill regions living in Jammu &Kashmir. We intend to take steps for their welfare as well.

My dear countrymen, peace and prosperity of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh can be an inspiration for India.  They can greatly contribute to India’s development.  We need to make efforts to bring back their glorious past.  The new system that has come into being after the recent step will create facilities that will directly benefit the people of the State.  Now, anybody in Jammu and Kashmir, like the rest of Indians, can reach out to the Government in Delhi. There will be no hurdles in between.  We have put in place such a system.  Our recent action to strike down Article 370 and 35 A has been welcomed by the entire country and also by people from all political parties of the country, without exception. Some have openly supported us while others give their tacit support.  But some in the corridors of power, in a bid to take mileage from vote-bank politics, have been talking in favour of Article 370.  The country demands an answer from those speaking in favour of Article 370, that if Article 370 and 35-A were so important.

If Article 370 was so crucial then why did ruling parties not make it permanent in the last 70 years despite having a majority? Why was it kept temporary? If there was so much of conviction, you should have moved ahead and made it permanent. This means that you knew all along that the decision taken was not right. But you did not have the courage and the will to amend it. Concerns about political future kept coming up. For me, the country’s future is everything, political future has no meaning.

Our constitution makers and great  personalities like Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel took these bold and important decisions even during those difficult times, keeping the goals of  national integration and political unification in mind. The exercise towards national integration was a successful one, but some difficulties have been faced because of Article 370 and 35A.

Today, as I address the nation from the Red Fort, I can proudly say that every Indian today can speak of One Nation, One Constitution and we are trying to fulfil Sardar Sahibs dream of Ék Bharat Shreshtha Bharat. So we must develop such systems which strengthen the country’s unity and serve as a cementing force, and this process must go on continuously. It should not be merely an interim measure but a continuous process.

Through GST we have fulfilled the dream of One Nation One Tax. Similarly, we successfully achieved the dream of One Nation, One Grid in the energy sector recently.

Likewise, we have developed the system of One Nation, One Mobility card and currently there is a nationwide debate about holding simultaneous elections in the country.  This discussion should be taken up in a democratic manner.  We will have to add many such new ideas to realize our dreams of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.

My dear countrymen, the country has to achieve newer heights, the country has to make its mark globally. For this we have to change the attitude towards poverty alleviation in the country. It should not be treated as a favour, but as oura dutiful contribution towards building a bright future for the country because we have to free ourselves from the clutches of poverty at any cost. A number of successful efforts have been made during the last 5 years to reduce poverty. We have achieved more success than before and at a faster pace. A little respect and support to the poor can boost their self-esteem and pull them out from the grips of poverty without any government help.

He will be able to defeat poverty with his own strength. It is my poor brethren who have the might to fight against any adversity. He fights against extreme cold with his clenched fists. We need to bow before his innate strength to face adversities and help in eliminating the challenges of his daily life.

Why should poor people not have  toilets, no electricity in the house, no house to live in, no water supply and no bank account. Why should they be compelled to go to the moneylender to take loans through mortgage? Come, let us make efforts to boost the self-respect, self-confidence and self-esteem of the poor.

Brothers and sisters, it is over 70 years since Independence. All governments have done a lot of work in their own way. Every government, irrespective of the party, be it the central or the state, has tried in its own way. But still it is a fact that today almost half of the houses in India do not have drinking water. People have to struggle to get drinking water. Mothers and sisters have to travel 2, 3, 5 km carrying the load of water on their heads. A large part of their lives is spent in struggling for water. Therefore, this government has decided to emphasize upon a special task and that is - how to ensure availability of water in every house. How does every house get water, pure drinking water?  And so I declare from the Red Fort today that in the days to come, we will take forward the 'Jal-Jeevan' Mission. The central and the state governments will jointly work on this 'Jal-Jeevan' Mission. We have promised to spend more than Rs. 3.5 lakh crores on this mission in the coming years.  Work should be done on water conservation, irrigation, rain-water harvesting, seawater or waste water treatment, and 'Per Drop, More Crop Micro Irrigation for the farmers. Water conservation campaigns should be launched, creating awareness in the common citizens about water, arousing their sensitivity so that they understand the importance of water; even the children should be taught about water conservation as part of their curriculum in their childhood. We must move forward with the belief that in the next five years we have to do more than four times the work that has been done in the last 70 years for water conservation and to revive the sources of water. We cannot wait any longer. The great Saint Thiruvalluvar ji had professed hundreds of years ago when perhaps no one would have thought of the water crisis and the importance of water.

And then Saint Thiruvalluvar ji had said NeerIndri Amiyadhu Ulganein  नीरिंडरी अमियदु  उलगनें  meaning that if water starts disappearing, then  nature’s processes get disrupted and eventually come to an end. This initiates the process of total destruction. 

I was born in Gujarat.  In North Gujarat, there is a jain pilgrim city called Mahudi. Approximately 100 years ago there lived a Jain saint who was born in a farmer’s family. He used to work in the fields but under the influence of Jainism. He became a Jain saint called Budhi Sagar ji Maharaj. He left behind some scriptures 100 years ago in which he shared a premonition that there will be a time when water will be sold in grocery shops. Can you imagine that the words of the saint written hundred years ago have actually become a reality now. What was predicted a century ago is now a ground reality, and today, we all are actually buying water from grocery shops. 

 Dear countrymen, we are not to get tired in our efforts, nor shall we halt or hesitate in moving ahead. 

This campaign on Water conservation should not just remain a government initiative. It should become a people’s movement like our Swacchh Bharat Abhiyan. We have to carry forward this movement with the help the common man’s ideals, aspirations and efforts.

Dear Countrymen, our nation has reached a phase when we should be transparent about everything.

Time has now come that we should take challenges head-on. Sometimes decisions are taken keeping in mind political advantage but they come at the cost of  growth of future generation of our country. I would like to highlight the issue of population explosion in one Country from the aegis of the Red Fort today.

This rapidly increasing population poses various new challenges for us and our future generations.

In our society, there is a section which is very well aware of the consequences of the uncontrolled population growth. They all deserve accolades and respect. This is also their expression for their love for the nation.  Before having a baby, they take a well considered decision whether they will be able to take care of the child’s needs and fulfill his/her dreams by playing the role of a responsible parent.

Keeping these parameters in mind, this small sections of responsible citizens is self motivated to keep their family small. Not only do they contribute to the welfare of their family but also to the good of the nation.

They express patriotism. I would like all the people of our society to watch their lives closely and see how much they have served their families by limiting increase in family size. It is about how the family has moved forward in just a generation or two,  how the children have got education, how the family is free from disease, how well the family fulfils their primary needs.

We should learn from them. Before a child arrives into our family we should think  - have I prepared myself to fulfil the  needs of the child ? Or will I leave it dependent on the society? Will I leave the child un-nurtured? No parents can continue to give birth to children who are forced to live this type of life and therefore a social awareness is needed.

The people who have played this huge role need to be honoured, and by setting them as examples we need to inspire the segment of the society who are still not thinking on these lines. We need to worry about population explosion.

Governments also have to come forward through different schemes. Be it the State Government or the Central Government - everyone has to walk together to shoulder this responsibility. We cannot think of an unhealthy society, we cannot think of an uneducated society. In 21st century India, the ability to fulfill dreams starts with a person, starts with a family. If the population is not educated, not healthy, then neither the home nor the country can be happy.  If the population is educated, empowered, and skilled and has adequate means available to achieve the right ambience to fulfill their wishes and needs, then I think the country can fulfill these things.

My dear countrymen, you are well aware that corruption and nepotism have damaged our country beyond imagination and entered into our lives like termites. We are continuously trying to weed them out.  There have been successes also, but the disease is so deeply entrenched, the disease is so wide spread that we will have to keep putting in more efforts and that too at every level, not just at the government level, and we need to keep doing it continuously.

All work cannot be done at one go, bad habits are like chronic disease. Sometimes it gets cured, but sometimes it relapses. This too is a disease for which we have taken many steps, eliminating it by continuous use of technology. Every effort has been made to strengthen honesty and transparency at all levels.

You must have seen that immediately after formation of the Government, and also in the last five years the Government has removed many top officials. All such people creating obstacles were told that the country does not need their services anymore and they have been removed.

I believe that there should be change in the system, but at the same time there should be a change in the social fabric. Along with the change in the social fabric, a change in the mindset and beliefs of the people running the systems is also very essential. Then only the desired results can be achieved.

Brothers and sisters, the country has, in a way, matured after so many years of independence.

We are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Independence. This Freedom is as precious to us as our ethical values, attitudes and sensitivities. Whenever I hold meetings with officials I’d always mention, I do not talk about it publicly but today I feel like speaking out, I repeatedly exhort the officials that after so many years of Independence can we not do something about cutting down red tape and reduce the involvement of the Government in the daily life of the common man.

The meaning of an Independent India for me is to create an ecosystem that gradually reduces the involvement of govt. in the lives of its peoples. This will give people the choice to decide about their own destiny and embark upon whichever direction they wish in the national interest, for betterment of their families and in the pursuit of their dreams.

Citizens should not feel pressure of the government but at the same time during a crisis the government must not be found wanting. The government should neither be exerting nor wanting, but let us all move forward with our dreams. The government should be always standing by us, as a companion. In case the need arises, the people should be assured that Govt. is always there to back them up. Can we create such a system?

We have done away with several unnecessary laws and rules which had been rendered redundant. In the last five years I have abolished, practically, one redundant law every day. Perhaps the common man is not aware of it, - abolishing one obsolete law each day means almost 1,450 laws have been done away with an aim to reduce the burden from the common man’s life. The (new) government has only completed ten weeks into office, and already (another) 60 laws have been repealed with an aim to bring about ‘Ease of Living’. ‘Ease of Living’ is imperative for an Independent India and we are committed to focus on ‘Ease of Living’ and want to take it ahead.

Today, we have made much progress towards ‘Ease of doing business.’ We aim to reach the Top Five in the global ranking and for this there will be a need for several reforms; anybody wanting to set up a small business or industry, faces several small and big issues, - such as filling up several forms, going  from pillar to post, he has to make visits to scores of offices, but he still  doesn’t get the requisite sanction. In attempts to unshackle this intricate web, bringing reforms after reform, taking the Centre and States together, taking along the city and metropolitan municipalities, we have been able to achieve a fair degree of success towards ‘Ease of doing business.’

Across the globe there is a growing realization that such a large country as India, a developing nation, can dream big and make such a big leap. ‘Ease of doing business’ seems just a milestone; my ultimate objective is to achieve is ‘Ease of living’, - where a common man does not have to exercise himself to get Govt./Officials clearances, he gets his due rights easily and thus there is a need for us to proceed in that direction.

My dear countrymen, our nation must march forward, but the country cannot now wait much longer for incremental progress, we will have to take a big leap, we will have to change our thinking. To make India reach the Global Standards we need to build modern infrastructure.

Notwithstanding despondent attitudes, ordinary people always dream of a good system. They like good things; they have developed a taste for it. So we have decided to invest 100 lakh crore rupees for modern infrastructure in this time period. This will generate employment; will develop new systems and various aspirations will be met. Be it Sagarmala Project or Bharat Mala Project, modern railway stations, bus stations or airports, be it modern hospitals or world class educational institutions, we want to develop the entire infrastructure. Now the country also requires seaports. The ordinary people have changed and we have to understand that.

Earlier, if a decision was taken on paper that a railway station was going to be constructed in a particular area, there used to be a positive feeling for years together that a new railway station would be available somewhere nearby. Times have changed now. The ordinary citizens are no longer satisfied with just a railway station. They will immediately ask, “When will Vande Bharat Express come to our area?” Their thinking has changed. If we construct a very good bus station or five star Railway station, the people will not say “well done”. They will forthwith ask, “When will the airport be ready”? That means their thinking has changed. The people who were happy with just getting a railway stoppage are now asking, “It is ok, but when is the airport going to open here?”

Earlier people used to ask, “When will a metaled road be constructed in our area?” Now people ask, “Will the road be of 4-lane or 6-lane one?” They are not satisfied to metaled roads any longer. I think this is a very significant change for aspiring India.

Earlier, even on seeing the electricity poles lying on the ground people used to be happy, thinking that the electricity had reached them even if the pole had not been erected. But now even after the installation of transmission wires and electric meters, people ask “When will we get 24-hour electric supply?” They are no longer happy with just poles and wires.

Earlier, when mobile phones were just in vogue, people were content that mobile phone had finally arrived. But now they discuss about data speed. We have to understand this transformation of psychology and changing times. We have to move forward in many fields, with the Global Benchmark like modern infrastructure, clean energy, gas based economy, gas grid, e-mobility etc.

My dear Countrymen, generally the governments of our country are identified with what they have done in a particular area or for a particular community or group. Generally, the government and the people went by the yardstick as to how much a government has given or to whom it has been given. This was considered as good enough. May be it was the need of the hour and a compulsion.

But despite whatever, however, whenever or whoever may have received in the past, we now need to unitedly think  about what dreams we want to achieve as a nation. Time demands that we live fight and move ahead in unison to fulfil these dreams. Keeping this in mind we have set a dream target of building a five trillion dollar economy.  130 crore countrymen can move together even with small contributions. The target of 5 trillion dollar economy may appear difficult to some people.  They may not be wrong but if we don’t accomplish difficult tasks, how will the country moved ahead? If we don’t take up difficult challenges how will we develop a mind set to move forward? Psychologically also we must always aim high and that is what we have done. This is not just in the air. We had reached a 2 trillion dollar economy after 70 years of independence, after 70 years’ journey on the path of development we could achieve just a 2 trillion dollar economy. But within five years from 2014 to 2019 we reached a 3 trillion dollar economy i.e we added one trillion dollars. If we succeeded in taking such a big jump in just 5 years, then we can become a 5 trillion dollar economy in the next five years. This must be a dream of every Indian.

When the economy grows, it brings better standard of living for the people. Opportunities get created to fulfil the dreams of even of those at bottom. In order to create these opportunities we have to develop this mind set about the economic sector of the country.

When we dream to double the income of our farmers, when we dream that after 75 years of independence each family, including the poorest of the poor, should own a house, when we dream that on completing 75 years of independence each family must get electricity in their house, when we dream that on completing 75 years of independence each village of India must have optical fibre network, broad band connectivity and long distance education, these should no longer be seem to be dreams.

We must focus upon developing our maritime resources and blue economy. We should empower our fishermen community. Our farmers, who provide us food, may become energy givers. Why should they not become exporters as well, why should the produce of our farmers not dominate the international market? We want to move ahead with these dreams. Our country will have to boost its export. Let us make every effort to reach the global market.

Each district of our country has a potential equal to that of one country, each of our districts has the capacity equal to a small country in the world. We need to understand this power and channelize this potential. And why should each district not think of becoming an export hub?  Each district has its own handicraft and each district has its unique specialities. If some district is known for its perfumes then some other district may have saris as its distinct identity whereas some other district is known for utensils and the other district is famous for its sweets. Each of our districts has a diverse identity and potential for global market.  

We are trying to see how can we use zero defect zero effect in manufacturing for global markets. If we focus on exports by making the world aware of this diversity, and work towards capturing the world market, then the youth of the country will get employment. This will give great strength to our small scale and micro level industries. We have to increase that strength.

Our country can be a fascinating tourist destination for the world, but for some reason, we have not been able to do it as fast as we need to. Come, let all of us, the countrymen, take the decision to boost tourism in the country. As tourism grows, capital investment provides more employment opportunities. The country's economy also gets a boost.  People all over the world are ready to see India in a new way today. Let us think how we can attract tourists to our country from the world over, how we can strengthen the tourism sector and what arrangements should be made at tourist destinations. We should also talk about increasing the income of ordinary citizens, better education for them, new employment opportunities. There should be launching pads for the middle class people so that they can realize their dreams. Our scientists should have the best facilities and resources, our forces should have the best weapons and equipment that too indigenously made. I believe that there are many areas which can give India a new strength to become a five trillion dollar economy.

My dear brothers and sisters, today the country has a very favourable environment for achieving economic success. When there is a stable government, the policies are predictable and systems are stable, then the world also starts having confidence in you. The people of the country have shown this. The world is also watching India's political stability with great pride and respect. We should not let this opportunity go. Today the world is keen to do business with us. It wants to connect with us. Today, it is a matter of great pride for us that while controlling inflation, we are moving forward with an important equation to increase the growth rate. Sometimes the growth rate may increase, but inflation is not under control. Sometimes when the inflation is under control, the growth rate gets affected. But our government has not only controlled inflation but has also increased the growth rate.

The fundamentals of our economy are very strong. And this strength gives us confidence to move ahead. In the same way, by developing a system like GST, and bringing reforms like Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, we want to develop an environment of confidence. There should be increased production in our country, increased processing of our natural wealth, value addition, export of the value added products to the world. Why can’t we have a dream wherein every country in the world imports some or the other Indian product, wherein every district of India exports some product? If we take these two things into consideration, then we can also increase the income. Our companies and entrepreneurs also dream of getting access to the world market. By getting access to the world market, our investors will be able to enhance the status of India; our investors will be able to earn more; our investors will be able to invest more; our investors will be able to generate more employment. We are completely ready to encourage our investors to come forward for generating employment.

In our country, certain wrong beliefs have come into existence. We have to come out of those mindset. Those who create wealth for the country, those who contribute in the nation’s wealth creation are all serving the country. We should not doubt our wealth creators.

The need of the hour is to recognise and encourage the wealth creators of our nation. They should receive more honour. If wealth is not created, wealth cannot be distributed. Further, if wealth is not distributed we cannot uplift the poor sector of our society. Such is the importance of wealth creation for our country which we need to facilitate further.

Those who are making efforts to create wealth, according to me they themselves are an asset to the nation and must be empowered.

My dear Countrymen, today we are emphasising on peace and security along with development. Globally, countries are gripped with several insecurities. Death seems hovering in some or the other part of the world.

India has to play a vital role in reinstating world peace. We cannot remain silent spectators in the global environment. We are putting up a tough fight against terrorist organisations. In any part of the world, an act of terrorism should be regarded as an attack on humanity. Therefore, I urge all forces to unite against those who promote and give shelter to terrorist outfits. India should contribute in exposing these anti-humanitarian activities and is resolute to unite all world forces to end terrorism.

We want that India should play a crucial role in the war against terrorism. India should unite all forces to expose those who give shelter to terrorists, those who encourage terrorism and those who export terrorism.

Some terrorist organisations have not only targeted India, but are also damaging our neighbouring countries. Bangladesh and Afghanistan are also grappling with terrorist activities. In Sri Lanka, sadly, innocent people have been killed en-masse inside a church. This is such a heart wrenching event. Hence, we all have to unite and act proactively to bring security, peace and harmony in this sub-continent. 

Our friendly neighbour Afghanistan is also going to celebrate its 100th year of independence, four days from now.  I would like to extend my heartiest greetings to them on this auspicious occasion.

It is our clear policy that those who are spreading fear and fostering violence must be razed to the ground. We have made this clear through our policies and strategies to curb all such malafide intentions. We have no inhibitions. Our army, border security forces and security agencies have done a commendable job. They always stand tall in their uniforms and guard us from all adversities. They have martyred their lives to ensure a bright future for us. I salute and I pay my homage to them. It is important that we take timely steps towards reforms.

You must have noticed that deliberations are on since a long time to bring reforms in military infrastructure, armed forces and military resources. Previous governments have also discussed the same. Several commissions have been formed and all the reports have brought to light the same issues. 

There is hardly any difference, but this has been stated repeatedly.  There indeed is coordination between our Navy, Army and Air Force. We can be proud of the arrangement of our armed forces.  Any Hindustani can be proud of Indian Military. They also strive for modernity in their own way.

But the world is changing today, the scope of war is changing, the nature of war is changing. It is becoming technology driven; in the circumstances India too should not have a fragmented approach. Our entire military power will have to work in unison and move forward. Things cannot move smoothly if anyone from the Navy, Army and Air Force is a step ahead from the other two forces, while the other two are lagging behind. All the three should move simultaneously at the same pace. There should be good coordination and it should be relevant with the hope and aspirations of our people.  It should be in line with the changing war and security environment in the world and today I want to announce an important decision from Red Fort. The subject experts on the issue have been demanding this for a long time. Today we have decided that we will now have a Chief of Defence Staff- CDS and after formation of this post all the three forces will get effective leadership at the top level. The CDS System is a very important and compelling task in our dream to reform the strategic pace of Hindustan in the world.

My dear countrymen, we are lucky that we are born in such a period, we are living in such a period, when we have the ability to do something.  Sometimes it comes to my mind that when we were fighting for freedom, great men like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru were competing for their sacrifice. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, freedom fighters were going door-to-door, to awaken the country to realize their dreams of independence. We were not born at that time. We did not get a chance to sacrifice for the country, but we have definitely got a chance to live for the country now. And it is a privilege that this period is like this, this year is very important for us. This is the festival of 150th birth anniversary of Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.

We feel blessed to have such opportunity. 75 years of our Independence and the remembrance of those who sacrificed for the country, inspires us to do something. We should capitalise on this opportunity. We, 130 crore of countrymen, have to move further, to achieve the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, the dreams of freedom fighters of the country.  We should make the 75 years of independence and 150 years of Gandhi into a festival. This is a great opportunity for our inspiration.

I had spoken about Swachhata in 2014 from this Red Fort. I am confident that within next few weeks of 2019 itself India will declare itself Open Defecation Free. States, Villages, Municipalities, Media, everyone has started Mass-Movement regarding ODF. The government was nowhere to be seen, people participated in the mass movement and the results are quite evident.

My dear countrymen, I would like to put forward a small request to you. On this 2 October can we make India free from single- use plastic? Let us move around, form teams and move out from home, school, college.

Remembering revered Bapu, we should move out of home collecting single-use plastic from homes, streets, chowks, and drains. Municipalities, Municipal corporations, Gram Panchayat should make arrangements to collect single-use plastic. Can we take first big step on 2nd October, towards making India free from single-use plastic?

Come my countrymen, let us take this forward.

I will request start-up organizations, technicians and entrepreneurs to see what we can do to recycle this plastic? Plastic is being used in making highways. Many such remedies can be there. But to get rid of such problems we have to initiate mass movement but at the same time we have to think of the alternate systems. I will request all shopkeepers along with many sign boards in your shop please also put another one exhorting customers not to use plastic bags; that they should instead bring their own cloth bags or buy cloth bags for carrying their goods. Let us create an environment. We generally give gifts to people on Diwali. Why not pack those gifts in cloth bags this year and every time? If people go to market with cloth bags, that will be an advertisement for your company too. If you give a diary or calendar nothing will happen. But if you give a bag, that will be a medium of your advertisement. It should be a jute bag. It will help farmers. The cloth bag will help famers. These are all small things. It will help poor widows who are into sewing. Our small steps can change the lives of ordinary people and we have to work towards that.

My dear countrymen, whether it is a five trillion economy dream or the dream of a self-reliant India, we are following the principles of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals are relevant even today. So we have to take forward our ‘Make in India’ mission. Shouldn’t made in India products be our priority? Let us decide whatever is produced and available in our country should be our priority. We have to give stress on local products for lucky tomorrow; we have to go for local for bright future. Whatever is produced in the village should be given priority. If it is not available in the village we have to go beyond that- to Tehsil, to the district and then to the state level. I don’t think that one has to go outside the state to meet one’s requirements. Our rural economy will get a boost; our small entrepreneurs will get a boost; our traditional things will get a fillip.

Brothers and sisters we like mobile phones, we like to send whatsapp messages, we like to be on Facebook-twitter. But we can help country’s economy through these means. Technology is useful for the people who know its usefulness. Technology is helpful for the development of a modern India. Why shouldn’t we move towards Digital payment? Today we are proud that our RuPay card is accepted in Singapore. In the near future RuPay card will be accepted in more countries. Our digital platform is spreading steadily. Shouldn’t we stress on digital payment in villages, small shops and small shopping malls? For the sake of honesty, transparency and to make our country’s economy strong let us move towards digital payment. If you go to villages you will generally see boards put up by traders saying “only cash, no credit please”. I will urge the businessmen to display another board: “say yes to digital payment and no to cash”. We should create an atmosphere like this. I will urge the banking sector and the people from the business world to give emphasis on these things. 

In our country the bulk of middle class and higher middle class are increasing. This is a good thing. People go to various countries as a tourist with their family once or twice in a year. It is good that our children get exposure.  But today I want to urge all such families to think over whether they will want their children to know their country as well, when it celebrates the 75th Year of its Independence, which could be achieved after many great men and women had sacrificed their lives?  Are there any parents who do not want their children to be emotionally connected with the country’s soil, its history, its air and water?   Do they not want their children to gather new energy from all these?  We have to move ahead in right earnest.  No matter how advanced we become, if we get cut off from our roots, we can never survive.  Today from the ramparts of Red Fort, I am asking you one thing. This is to generate employment of the youth, to build an image of India in the world and to tell the world what India is capable of.   It is time you decide that before 2022, when India will be celebrating the 75th Year of its Independence, we take our families to at least 15 tourist destinations in the country.  We may face some difficulties in those places but still, you should go.  There may not be good hotels. But, sometimes such difficulties also bring opportunities along.  Our children will learn what their country is, when they visit such tourist destinations.  The people who can build facilities will also reach there and that will generate employment.  Why don’t we develop 100 good tourist destinations, why shouldn’t there be target of developing 2, 5 or 7 top class tourist destinations in every state?  North-East of India has huge natural resources but how many universities make that part of the country as their tourist destination?  You do not have to spend much, neither do have you need to spend a lot of time; in 7 to 10 days you can visit within the country.

 A new world will come into being in the places you visit.  You will get bliss in the life once we Indians visit the tourist spots of North-East, foreigners will also follow suit.  But, think over when we go out of the country and the people there ask, whether you have seen that temple in Tamil Nadu and we say ‘’No’’; then how does it feel.  They would be surprised and say that they being foreigners, have visited that temple but you being an Indian have not seen it so far.   So, before we go abroad we must know our country well. 

Now, I want to ask something from my farmer brothers. For farmers, for my countrymen this country is their motherland.  As we chant ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai” our hearts are filled with new energy.

The word “Vande Mataram’’ enthuses our hearts with a wish to sacrifice for the country.  A long history beckons us. But have we ever cared to think about our motherland’s health?  The way we are using chemical fertilizers and pesticides, it is damaging the health of its soil.  As a farmer, as a child of this soil, I have no right to damage its health.  I have no right to make my mother India sad nor do have I right to make her sick.

We would soon complete 75 years since our Independence.

Revered Bapu showed us the way. Should we not cut down the use of chemical fertilizer in our fields by 10% or 20% or 25% and if possible should we not launch a Muktikar Abhiyan (campaign)?. This would be a great service to the nation. This would be a great step in saving our Mother Earth. Your endeavour in saving our mother earth will also get blessings of those who dedicated their lives chanting Vande Mataram in order to fulfil the dream of achieving freedom for our motherland. Therefore I appeal to you as I am fully confident that my countrymen will definitely be able to achieve this.  My farmers will fulfil this request of mine because I have full trust in them.

My dear brothers and sisters, professionals of our country are at a commanding position globally. Their potential is very well recognised. People respect them. Be it space, be it technology, we have achieved new heights. It’s a matter of happiness of us that our Chandrayaan is moving speedily towards that part of the moon where no one has ever reached. Such is the mastery of our scientists.

Similarly, our presence was much less in the field of sports. Today young sons and daughters of my country in the age group of 18 to 22 are making India’s tricolor fly in various sports stadia. How proud that feels! Our sportspersons are earning laurels for the country.

Dear countrymen, we have to take our country forward. We have to transform our country. We have to make our country reach newer heights and we have to do this collectively. The government and the people have to achieve this collectively and jointly.  Our 130 crore countrymen have to do this.  Prime Minister of the country is also a child of this country like you and he also is a citizen of the country. We all have to work unitedly for this.

In the coming days about 1.5 lakh wellness centres and health centres will have to be set up in rural areas. Setting up one medical college for every three Lok Sabha constituencies will make us realize the dream of our youth becoming doctors. Houses for more than 2 crore poor people have to be built. We have to supply potable drinking water to 15 crore houses in rural areas, construct 1.25 km roads in rural areas. Each village has to be provided with Broad Band connectivity and connected with optical fibre network, also a network of more than 50000 new start-ups has to be raised. We need to move forward with so many dreams.

And, therefore, brothers and sisters, we the countrymen have to collectively take our country forward with these dreams in mind and for this 75 years of independence is a very big motivation.

130 crore countrymen have their dreams, their challenges. Each dream and each challenge has its own importance. It is not that some is more important and the other is less important. It may not be possible for me to delve at all the topics during this speech. So, whatever I could speak today and whatever I could not speak are equally important. If we move forward, we should keep in mind that we have to take our country forward.

75 years of Independence, 150 years of Gandhi and 70 years of India’s Constitution has been completed for realising the dream of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. We are also celebrating 550th  Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji this year. Let us move ahead following the teachings of Baba Saheb Ambedker and Guru Nanak Dev ji as we have to build a better society and a better country as per the expectations of the whole world.

My dear brothers and sisters, we know that our targets are as high as the Himalayas, our dreams are even more than the innumerable stars. But we also know that even skies cannot check the flight of our courage.

This is our resolve, our potential is beyond measure just like the Indian Ocean. Our efforts are holy like the flowing Ganges and are ever continuing. Above all these things our values draw inspiration from our ancient culture and the penance of our sages and saints. The sacrifice and hard work of our countrymen is our motivation.

Come on, let us move ahead to build a new India keeping these ideals and resolves in mind. Fulfilling our responsibilities with a new confidence and a new resolve to build a new India should be our mantra. Let us together take our country forward with this single expectation, I once again bow to everyone who lived, fought, died for the country.

Jai Hind.

Jai Hind.

Bharat Mata ki Jai.

Bharat Mata ki Jai.

Vande Mataram

Vande Mataram

Thank you very very much.

	I extend warm greetings and best wishes on the 73rd Independence Day and on the auspicious festival of Raksha Bandhan to all the countrymen, brothers and sisters.
	As the country is celebrating the festival of Independence, people in several parts of the country are facing difficulties due to floods.  Centre, States and other organizations are striving hard to bring the situation back to normal.  
	To revoke Article 370 and 35A within 10 weeks of the formation of the new Government is a significant step towards fulfilling the dream of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. The task that was not done in the last 70 years has been accomplished within 70 days. The abrogation of Article 370 and 35A was passed in both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha by two-thirds majority.
	If we can abolish Sati system, make stringent laws against female foeticide and take action against child marriage and dowry, we can also raise our voice against Triple Talaq.


          Similarly, we have enacted law against Triple Talaq to protect the rights of our Muslim women.


	Radical amendments were made in laws relating to terrorism and were made more stringent and powerful. 
	In a significant step, transfer of about Rs. 90,000 crores to farmers’ bank accounts is in progress to those who are beneficiaries of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana.
	Pension scheme to farmers and small entrepreneurs has been put in place which was  never imagined earlier. 
	To address challenges of water crisis, a new dedicated Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created. 
	In coming days, Centre and States will together take forward the Jal-Jeevan Mission and an amount of more than Rs. 3.5 lakh crores has been earmarked for this. 
	There is a pressing need for doctors, health facilities and systems in the country.  In order to make Medial Education transparent, important laws have been enacted. 
	The country has enacted strong laws for protection of children.   
	While 2014-2019 was an era of fulfillment of needs, the period beyond 2019 is that of fulfillment of aspirations and dreams.
	It is our responsibility that the aspirations of the citizens of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are fulfilled and dalits living there should get equal rights as enjoyed by the rest of the dalits in the country. Similarly, communities like Gujjars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, Sippies or Balties should get political rights.  After partition, lakhs of people got displaced and settled in Jammu & Kashmir were devoid of basic human rights and citizenship rights.
	J&K and Ladakh can become role models of peace and prosperity and contribute significantly towards India’s development.  The state can greatly contribute to India’s development.  Today every Indian  can proudly say ‘One Nation, One Constitution’. 
	 GST achieved the dream of ‘One Nation, One tax’.  We successfully attained ‘One Nation, One Grid’ in the power sector.  We also developed ‘One Nation, One Mobility Card’ system and today there is a discussion in the country for ‘One Nation, One Poll’ and it should happen in a democratic  manner.
	Population explosion can create new problems specially for the future generations.  But there is also an enlightened section of society which is aware of this challenge.  We have to ponder on this issue taking along all the sections of the society. 
	Corruption and nepotism have harmed the country beyond imagination.  We have taken several steps driven by technology to fight this menace. 
	Ease of living is the necessity of independent India. We should build an eco-system in which there should be less Government interference in daily life.   
	The country can no longer wait for incremental progress but should strive for giant strides. 
	For development of modern infrastructure, an amount of Rs. 100 lakh crore has been earmarked for this period which will create new job opportunities besides improving the living standards.  
	India dreams of a 5 Trillion Dollar Economy.  In the 70 years of independence, the country became a 2 Trillion Dollar Economy but in the last 5 years, we have made it a 3 Trillion Dollar Economy and at this pace, we can become a 5 Trillion Dollar Economy. 
	By 75th year of independence, farmers’ income should double, every poor should get a pucca house, every family should get electricity connection and every village should have optical fibre network and broadband connectivity besides facility of long distance education. 
	We have to lay stress on Blue Economy (Ocean resources).  Our farmers should become exporters and every district of the country should be an export hub.  Value added goods from every district should reach global markets.
	As a Tourist Destination, India can become a wonder in the world. All Indians should promote tourism, because tourism sector provides more jobs with less investments and also strengthens economy.
	A stable government provides for policy predictability and a stable system creates international trust.  The world is looking at India with admiration for its political stability.
	It is a matter of pride for India that we are progressing at a high growth rate with price rise under control. 
	The fundamentals of our economy are very strong and reforms like GST & IBC have created a new faith in the system. Our investors should invest more, earn more and generate more jobs. We should stop viewing our Wealth Creators with suspicion: they deserve greater respect. Greater wealth creation will lead to greater distribution and help in the welfare of poor people.
	India is strongly fighting against the forces spreading terrorism. India in league with other nations of the world will expose those harbouring, promoting and exporting terrorism. To abolish the menace of terrorism, our security forces and security agencies have played an exemplary role and I salute them.
	India’s neighbours - Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka are suffering from terrorism.  Our good friend in the neighborhood – Afghanistan is going to celebrate its 100th independence day in four days to come.  From the ramparts of the Red Fort, I give my greetings to the people of Afghanistan who are marking 100 years of freedom.
	I had flagged the issue of Swachhata from the ramparts of Red Fort in 2014 and a few weeks from now on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, India will become an open defecation free nation.
	Our country has been debating for long about reforms in Armed Forces and many commissions and their reports underline the same. To further sharpen coordination between the forces, India will have Chief of Defence Staff, CDS which will make the forces even more effective.
	I wish the countrymen to pledge to make India free from single use plastic by 2nd October.   For this every citizen, municipalities and gram panchayats should come together.
	Our priority should be a 'Made in India' product. For a better tomorrow, can we think of consuming local products and also help improve rural economy and the MSME sector.
	Our digital payment platforms are evolving strong.  We should lay stress on digital payments for our village shops, small outlets and smaller city malls.
	We are spoiling health of soil by use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. When Gandhiji has already shown us the path, can’t we reduce by 10%, 20% or  25% use of chemical fertilizers.    I am sure our farmers will oblige my wish.
	Indian professional are recognized globally. Our scientists have proved their mettle in Chandrayaan which is reaching the uncharted territory of the moon.
	In the coming days, 1.5 lakh wellness centers will be created at villages. One medical college in the midst of three Lok Sabha constituencies,  housing for two crore poor people, drinking water supply in 15 crore rural households and 1.25 lakh km roads in rural areas, besides connecting every village with broadband and optical fiber network are some of the targets to be achieved.  More than  50,000 new start ups are also being planned.
	Indian constitution is completing 70 years, the dream of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and this year is also important for the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.  Let us move forward by imbibing the teachings of Baba Saheb and Guru Nanak Dev for a better society and a better country.

                मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, 

स्‍वतंत्रता के इस पवित्र दिवस पर, सभी देशवासियों को अनेक-अनेक शुभकामनाएं। 

आज रक्षा-बंधन का भी पर्व है। सदियों से चली आई यह परंपरा भाई-बहन के प्‍यार को अभिव्‍यक्‍त करती है। मैं सभी देशवासियों को, सभी भाइयों-बहनों को इस रक्षा-बंधन के पावन पर्व पर अनेक-अनेक शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। स्‍नेह से भरा यह पर्व हमारे सभी भाइयों-बहनों के जीवन में आशा-आकांक्षाओं को पूर्ण करने वाला हो, सपनों को साकार करने वाला होऔर स्‍नेह की सरिता को बढ़ाने वाला हो। 

आज जब देश आजादी का पर्व मना रहा है, उसी समय देश के अनेक भागों में अति वर्षा के कारण, बाढ़ के कारण लोग कठिनाइयों से जूझ रहे हैं। कइयों ने अपने स्‍वजन खोए हैं। मैं उनके प्रति अपनी संवेदनाएं प्रकट करता हूं और राज्‍य सरकार, केंद्र सरकार, एनडीआरएफ सभी संगठन, नागरिकों का कष्‍ट कम कैसे हो, सामान्‍य परिस्थिति जल्‍दी कैसे लौटे, उसके लिए दिन-रात प्रयास कर रहे हैं।  

आज जब हम आजादी के इस पवित्र दिवस को मना रहे हैं, तब देश की आजादी के लिए जिन्‍होंने अपना जीवन दे दिया, जिन्‍होंने अपनी जवानी दे दी, जिन्‍होंने जवानी जेलों में काट दी, जिन्‍होंने फांसी के फंदे को चूम लिया, जिन्‍होंने सत्‍याग्रह के माध्‍यम से आजादी के बिगुल में अहिंसा के स्‍वर भर दिए। पूज्य बापू के नेतृत्‍व में देश ने आजादी पाई।मैं आज देश के आजादी के उन सभी बलिदानियों को, त्‍यागी-तपस्वियों को आदरपूर्वक नमन करता हूं। 

उसी प्रकार से देश आजाद होने के बाद इतने वर्षों में देश की शांति के लिए, सुरक्षा के लिए, समृद्धि के लिए लक्षावधी लोगों ने अपना योगदान दिया है। मैं आज आजाद भारत के विकास के लिए, शांति के लिए, समृद्धि के लिए जनसामान्‍य की आशाओं-आकांक्षाओं को पूर्ण करने के लिए जिन-जिन लोगों ने योगदान किया है, आज मैं उनको भी नमन करता हूं। 

नई सरकार बनने के बाद लालकिले से मुझे आज फिर से एक बार आप सबका गौरव करने का अवसर मिला है। अभी इस नई सरकार को दस हफ्ते भी नहीं हुए हैं, लेकिन दस हफ्ते के छोटे से कार्यकाल में भी सभी क्षेत्रों में, सभी दिशाओं मेंहर प्रकार के प्रयासों को बल दिया गया है, नये आयाम दिए गए हैं और सामान्‍य जनता ने जिन आशा, अपेक्षा, आकांक्षाओं के साथ हमें सेवा करने का मौका दिया है, उसको पूर्ण करने में एक पल का भी विलंब किये बिना,हम पूरे सामर्थ्य के साथ, पूरे समर्पण भाव के साथ, आपकी सेवा में मग्‍न हैं। 

दस हफ्ते के भीतर-भीतर ही अनुच्‍छेद 370 का हटना, 35A का हटना सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल के सपनों को साकार करने की दिशा में एक अहम कदम है।दस हफ्ते के भीतर-भीतर हमारे मुस्लिम माताओं और बहनों को उनका अधिकार दिलाने के लिए तीन तलाक के खिलाफ कानून बनाना, आतंक से जुड़े कानूनों में आमूल-चूल परिवर्तन करके उसको एक नई ताकत देने का, आतंकवाद के खिलाफ लड़ने के संकल्‍प को और मजबूत करने का काम,  हमारे किसान भाइयों-बहनों को प्रधानमंत्री सम्‍मान निधि के तहत 90 हजार करोड़ रुपया किसानों के खाते में transferकरने का एक महत्‍वपूर्ण काम आगे बढ़ा है। 

हमारे किसान भाई-बहन, हमारे छोटे व्‍यापारी भाई-बहन, उनकोकभी कल्‍पना नहीं थी कि कभी उनके जीवन में भी पेंशन की व्‍यवस्‍था हो सकती है। साठ साल की आयु के बाद वे भी सम्‍मान के साथ जी सकते हैं। शरीर जब ज्‍यादा काम करने के लिए मदद न करता हो, उस समय कोई सहारा मिल जाए, वैसी पेंशन योजना को भी लागू करने का काम कर दिया है। 

जल संकट की चर्चा बहुत होती है, भविष्‍य जल संकट से गुजरेगा, यह भी चर्चा होती है, उन चीजों को पहले से ही सोच करके, केंद्र और राज्‍य मिलकर के योजनाएं बनाएं इसके लिए एक अलग जल-शक्ति मंत्रालय का भी निर्माण किया गया है। 

हमारे देश में बहुत बड़ी तादाद में डॉक्‍टरों की जरूरत है, आरोग्‍य की सुविधाएं और व्‍यवस्‍थाओं की आवश्यकता है। उसको पूर्ण करने के लिए नए कानूनों की जरूरत है, नई व्‍यवस्‍थाओं की जरूरत है, नई सोच की जरूरत है, देश के नौजवानों को डॉक्‍टर बनने के लिए अवसर देने की जरूरत है। उन चीजों को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए Medical Education को पारदर्शी बनाने के लिए अनेक महत्‍वपूर्ण कानून हमने बनाए हैं, महत्‍वपूर्ण निर्णय लिए हैं। 

आज पूरे विश्‍व में बच्‍चों के साथ अत्‍याचार की घटनाएं सुनते हैं। भारत भी हमारे छोटे-छोटे बालकों को असहाय नहीं छोड़ सकता है। उन बालकों की सुरक्षा के लिए कठोर कानून प्रबंधन आवश्‍यक था। हमने इस काम को भी पूर्ण कर लिया है। 

भाइयो-बहनो, 2014 से 2019, पांच साल मुझे सेवा करने का आपने मौका दिया। अनेक चीजें ऐसी थीं... सामान्‍य मानव अपनी निजी आवश्‍यकताओं के लिए जूझता था। हमनें पांच साल लगातार प्रयास किया कि हमारे नागरिकों की जो रोजमर्रा की जिदंगी की आवश्‍यकताएं हैं, खासतौर पर गांव की, गरीब की, किसान की, दलित की, पीड़ित की, शोषित की, वंचित की, आदिवासी की,उन पर बल देने का हमने प्रयास किया है और गाड़ी को हम ट्रैक पर लाए और उस दिशा में आज बहुत तेजी से काम चल रहा है। लेकिन वक्‍त बदलता है। अगर 2014 से 2019 आवश्‍यकताओं की पूर्ति का दौर था, तो 2019 के बाद का कालखंड देशवासियों की आकांक्षाओं की पूर्ति का कालखंड है, उनके सपनों को साकार करने का कालखंड है और इसलिए 21वीं सदी का भारतकैसा हो, कितनी तेज गति से चलता हो, कितनी व्‍यापकता से काम करता हो, कितनी ऊंचाई से सोचता हो,इन सभी बातों को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए, आने वाले पांच साल के कार्यकाल को आगे बढ़ाने का एक खाका हम तैयार करके एक के बाद एक कदम उठा रहे हैं। 

2014 में, मैं देश के लिए नया था। 2013-14 में चुनाव के पूर्व, भारत-भ्रमण करके मैं देशवासियों की भावनाओं को समझने का प्रयास कर रहा था।लेकिन हर किसी के चेहरे पर एक निराशा थी, एक आशंका थी।लोग सोचते थे क्‍या यह देश बदल सकता है? क्‍या सरकारें बदलने से देश बदल जाएगा? एक निराशा जन-सामान्‍य के मन में घर कर गई थी। लम्‍बे कालखंड के अनुभव का यह परिणाम था- आशाएं लम्‍बी टिकती नहीं थीं, पल-दो पल में आशा, निराशा के गर्त में डूब जाती थी। लेकिन जब 2019 में, पांच साल के कठोर परिश्रम के बाद जन-सामान्‍य के लिए एकमात्र समर्पण भाव के साथ, दिल-दिमाग में सिर्फ और सिर्फ मेरा देश, दिल-दिमाग में सिर्फ और सिर्फ मेरे देश के करोड़ों देशवासी इस भावना को लेकर चलते रहे, पल-पल उसी के लिए खपाते रहेऔर जब 2019 में गए, मैं हैरान था। देशवासियों का मिजाज बदल चुका था।  निराशा, आशा में बदल चुकी थी, सपने, संकल्‍पों से जुड़ चुके थे, सिद्धि सामने नजर आ रही थी और सामान्‍य मानव का एक ही स्‍वर था- हां, मेरा देश बदल सकता है। सामान्‍य मानव की एक ही गूंज थी- हां, हम भी देश बदल सकते हैं, हम पीछे नहीं रह सकते।

130 करोड़ नागरिकों के चेहरे के ये भाव, भावनाओं की यह गूंज हमें नई ताकत, नया विश्‍वास देती है।

सबका साथ-सबका विकास का मंत्र ले करके चले थे, लेकिन पांच साल के भीतर-भीतर ही देशवासियों ने सबके विश्‍वास के रंग से पूरे माहौल को रंग दिया। ये सबका विश्‍वास ही पांच सालों में पैदा हुआ जो हमें आने वाले दिनों में और अधिक सामर्थ्‍य के साथ देशवासियों की सेवा करने के लिए प्रेरित करता रहेगा।

इस चुनाव में मैंने देखा थाऔर मैंने उस समय भी कहा था- न कोई राजनेता चुनाव लड़ रहा था, न कोई राजनीतिक दल चुनाव लड़ रहा था, न मोदी चुनाव लड़ रहा था, न मोदी के साथी चुनाव लड़ रहे थे, देश का आम आदमी, जनता-जनार्दन चुनाव लड़ रही थी, 130 करोड़ देशवासी चुनाव लड़ रहे थे, अपने सपनों के लिए लड़ रहे थे। लोकतंत्र का सही स्‍वरूप इस चुनाव में नजर आ रहा था।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, समस्‍याओं का समाधान- इसके साथ-साथ सपनों, संकल्‍प और सिद्धि का कालखंड- हमें अब साथ-साथ चलना है। यह साफ बात है कि समस्याओं का जब समाधान होता है, तो स्वावलंबन का भाव पैदा होता है। समाधान से स्वावलंबन की ओर गतिबढ़ती है। जब स्वावलंबन होता है, तो अपने-आप स्‍वाभिमान उजागर होता है और स्‍वाभिमान का सामर्थ्‍य बहुत होता है। आत्‍म-सम्‍मान का सामर्थ्‍य किसी से भी ज्‍यादा होता है और जब समाधान हो, संकल्‍प हो, सामर्थ्‍य हो, स्‍वाभिमान हो,तब सफलता के आड़े कुछ नहीं आ सकता है और आज देश उस स्‍वाभिमान के साथ सफलता की नई ऊंचाइयों को पार करने के लिये, आगे बढ़ने के लिये कृत-निश्चय है। जब हम समस्याओं का समाधान देखते हैं, तो टुकड़ों में नहीं सोचना चाहिए। तकलीफें आयेंगी, एक साथ वाह-वाही के लिये हाथ लगाकर छोड़ देना, यह तरीका देश के सपनों को साकार करने के काम नहीं आयेगा। हमें समस्याओं को जड़ों से मिटाने की कोशिश करनी होगी। आपने देखा होगा हमारी मुस्लिम बेटियां, हमारी बहनें, उनके सिर पर तीन तलाक की तलवार लटकती थी, वे डरी हुई जिंदगी जीती थीं। तीन तलाक की शिकार शायद नहीं हुई हों, लेकिन कभी भी तीन तलाक की शिकार हो सकती हैं, यह भय उनको जीने नहीं देता था, उनको मजबूर कर देता था। दुनिया के कई देश, इस्लामिक देश, उन्होंने भी इस कुप्रथा को हमसे बहुत पहले खत्म कर दिया, लेकिन किसी न किसी कारण से हमारी इन मुस्लिम माताओं-बहनों को हक देने में हम हिचकिचाते थे। अगर इस देश में, हम सती प्रथा को खत्म कर सकते हैं, हम भ्रूण हत्या को खत्म करने के कानून बना सकते हैं, अगर हम बाल-विवाह के खिलाफ आवाज उठा सकते हैं, हम दहेज में लेन-देन की प्रथा के खिलाफ कठोर कदम उठा सकते हैं, तो क्यों न हम तीन तलाक के खिलाफ भी आवाज उठाएं और इसलिए भारत के लोकतंत्र की spirit को पकड़ते हुये, भारत के संविधान की भावना का, बाबा साहेब अंबेडकर की भावना का आदर करते हुये, हमारी मुस्लिम बहनों को समान अधिकार मिले, उनके अंदर भी एक नया विश्वास पैदा हो, भारत की विकास यात्रा में वे भी सक्रिय भागीदार बनें, इसलिये हमने यह महत्वपूर्ण निर्णय लिया। ये निर्णय राजनीति के तराजू से तौलने के निर्णय नहीं होते हैं, सदियों तक माताओं-बहनों के जीवन की रक्षा की गारंटी देते हैं। 

उसी प्रकार से मैं एक दूसरा उदाहरण देना चाहता हूं - अनुच्छेद 370, 35A।  क्या कारण था? इस सरकार की पहचान है - हम समस्याओं को टालते भी नहीं हैं और न ही हम समस्याओं को पालते हैं। अब समस्याओं को टालने का भी वक्त नहीं है,  अब समस्याओं का पालने का भी वक्त नहीं है। जो काम पिछले 70 साल में नहीं हुआ, नई सरकार बनने के बाद, 70 दिन के भीतर-भीतर अनुच्‍छेद 370 और 35A को हटाने का काम भारत के दोनों सदनों ने, राज्यसभा और लोकसभा ने, दो-तिहाई बहुमत से पारित कर दिया। इसका मतलब यह हुआ कि हर किसी के दिल में यह बात थी, लेकिन प्रारंभ कौन करे, आगे कौन आये, शायद उसी का इंतजार था और देशवासियों ने मुझे यह काम दिया और जो काम आपने मुझे दिया मैं वही करने के लिए आया हूं। मेरा अपना कुछ नहीं है।

हम जम्मू-कश्मीर reorganisation की दिशा में भी आगे बढ़े। 70 साल हर किसी ने कुछ-न-कुछ प्रयास किया, हर सरकार ने कोई-न-कोई प्रयास किया लेकिन इच्छित परिणाम नहीं मिले और जब इच्छित परिणाम नहीं मिले हैं, तो नये सिरे से सोचने की, नये सिरे से कदम बढ़ाने की आवश्‍यकता होती है। और जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर और लद्दाख के नागरिकों की आशा-आकांक्षा पूरी हो, यह हम सब का दायित्‍व है। उनके सपनों को नये पंख मिले, यह हम सब की जिम्‍मेदारी है। और उसके लिए 130 करोड़ देशवासियों को इस जिम्‍मेदारी को उठाना है और इस जिम्मेदारी को पूरा करने के लिए, जो भी रुकावटें सामने आई हैं, उनको दूर करने का हमने प्रयास किया है। 

पिछले 70 साल में इन व्‍यवस्‍थाओं ने अलगाववाद को बल दिया है, आतंकवाद को जन्‍म दिया है, परिवारवाद को पोसा है और एक प्रकार से भ्रष्‍टाचार और भेदभाव की नींव को मजबूती देने का ही काम किया है। और इसलिएवहां की महिलाओं को अधिकार मिलें। वहां के मेरे दलित भाइयो-बहनो को, देश के दलितों को जो अधिकार मिलता था, वो उन्हें नहीं मिलता था। हमारे देश के जनजातीय समूहों को, tribalsको जो अधिकार मिलते हैं, वो उनको भी मिलने चाहिए। वहां हमारे कई ऐसे समाज और व्‍यवस्‍था के लोग चाहे वह गुर्जर हों, बकरवाल हों, गद्दी हों, सिप्‍पी हों, बाल्‍टी हों - ऐसी अनेक जनजातियां, उनको राजनीतिक अधिकार भी मिलने चाहिए। उसे देने की दिशा में, हम हैरान हो जाएंगे, वहां के हमारे सफाई कर्मचारी भाइयों और बहनों पर कानूनी रोक लगा दी गई थीं। उनके सपनों को कुचल दिया गया था। आज हमने उनको यह आजादी देने का काम किया है।

भारत विभाजन हुआ, लाखों-करोड़ों लोग विस्‍थापित होकर आये उनका कोई गुनाह नहीं था लेकिन जो जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर मेंआकर बसे, उनको मानवीय अधिकार भी नहीं मिले, नागरिक के अधिकार भी नहीं मिले। जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर के अन्‍दर मेरे पहाड़ी भाई-बहन भी हैं। उनकी भी चिंता करने की दिशा में हम कदम उठाना चाहते हैं। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर और लद्दाख सुख-समृद्धि और शांति के लिए भारत के लिए प्रेरक बन सकता है। भारत की विकास यात्रा में बहुत बड़ा योगदान दे सकता है। उसके पुराने उन महान दिवसों को लौटाने का हम सब प्रयास करें। उन प्रयासों को लेकर यह जो नई व्‍यवस्‍था बनी है वह सीधे-सीधे नागरिकों के हितों के लिए काम करने के लिए सुविधा पैदा करेगी। अब देश का, जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर का सामान्‍य नागरिक भी दिल्‍ली सरकार को पूछ सकता है। उसको बीच में कोई रुकावटें नहीं आएंगी। यह सीधी-सीधी व्‍यवस्‍था आज हम कर पाए हैं। लेकिन जब पूरा देश, सभी राजनीतिक दलों के भीतर भी, एक भी राजनीतिक दल अपवाद नहीं हैं, अनुच्‍छेद 370,35Aको हटाने के लिए कोई प्रखर रूप से तो कोई मूक रूप से समर्थन देता रहा है। लेकिन राजनीति के गलियारों में चुनाव के तराजू से तोलने वाले कुछ लोग 370 के पक्ष में कुछ न कुछ कहते रहते हैं। जो लोग 370 के पक्ष में वकालत करते हैं, उनको देश पूछ रहा है, अगर ये अनुच्‍छेद 370, यह 35Aइतना महत्‍वपूर्ण था,इतना अनिवार्य था, उसी से भाग्य बदलने वाला थातो 70 साल तक इतना भारी बहुमत होने के बावजूद आप लोगों ने उसको permanent क्‍यों नहीं किया? Temporary क्‍यों बनाए रखा? अगर इतना conviction था, तो आगे आते और permanent कर देते। लेकिन इसका मतलब यह है, आप भी जानते थेजो तय हुआ है, वह सही नहीं हुआ है, लेकिन सुधार करने की आप में हिम्‍मत नहीं थी, इरादा नहीं था। राजनीतिक भविष्‍य पर सवालिया निशान लगते थे। मेरे लिए देश का भविष्‍य ही सब कुछ है, राजनीतिक भविष्‍य कुछ नहीं होता है।

हमारे संविधान निर्माताओं ने, सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल जैसे महापुरुषों ने, देश की एकता के लिए, राजकीय एकीकरण के लिए उस कठिन समय में भी महत्‍वपूर्ण फैसले लिए, हिम्‍मत के साथ फैसले लिए। देश के एकीकरण का सफल प्रयास किया। लेकिन Article 370 के कारण, 35A के कारण कुछ रुकावटें भी आई हैं।

आज लाल किले सेमैं जब देश को संबोधित कर रहा हूं, मैं यह गर्व के साथ कहता हूं कि आज हर हिन्‍दुस्तानी कह सकता है- One Nation, One Constitution और हम सरदार साहब का एक भारत-श्रेष्‍ठ भारत, इसी सपने को चरितार्थ करने में लगे हुए हैं। तब ये साफ-साफ बनता है कि हम ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को विकसित करेंजो देश की एकता को बल दें, देश को जोड़ने के लिए cementing force के रूप में उभर करके आएं और यह प्रक्रिया निरंतर चलनी चाहिए। वह एक समय के लिए नहीं होती है, अविरल होनी चाहिए।

GST के माध्‍यम सेहमने One Nation, One Tax, उस सपने को साकार किया है। उसी प्रकार सेपिछले दिनों ऊर्जा के क्षेत्र में One Nation, One Grid इस काम को भी हमने सफलतापूर्वक पार किया।

उसी प्रकार से One Nation, One Mobility Card - इस व्‍यवस्‍था को भी हमने विकसित किया है। और आज देश में व्‍यापक रूप से चर्चा चल रही है, “एक देश, एक साथ चुनाव’’। यह चर्चा होनी चाहिए, लोकतांत्रिक तरीके से होनी चाहिए और कभी न कभी “एक भारत-श्रेष्‍ठ भारत’’ के सपनों को साकार करने के लिए और भी ऐसी नई चीजों को हमें जोड़ना होगा।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, देश को नई ऊंचाइयों को पार करना है, देश को विश्‍व के अंदर अपना स्‍थान प्रस्‍थापित करना है। तो हमें अपने घर में भी गरीबी से मुक्ति के भान को बल देना ही होगा। यह किसी के लिए उपकार नहीं है। भारत के उज्‍ज्‍वल भविष्‍य के लिए, हमें गरीबी से मुक्‍त होना ही होगा। गत पांच वर्ष में गरीबी कम करने की दिशा में, लोग गरीबी से बाहर आएं, बहुत सफल प्रयास हुए हैं। पहले की तुलना में ज्‍यादा तेज गति से और ज्‍यादा व्‍यापकता से इस दिशा में सफलता प्राप्‍त हुई है।लेकिन फिर भी गरीब व्‍यक्ति, सम्‍मान अगर उसको प्राप्‍त हो जाता है, उसका स्‍वाभिमान जग जाता है तो वह गरीबी से लड़ने के लिए सरकार का इंतजार नहीं करेगा।वो अपने सामर्थ्‍य से गरीबी को परास्‍त करने के लिए आएगा। हम में से किसी से भी ज्‍यादा विपरीत परिस्थितियों से जूझने की ताकत अगर किसी में है, तो मेरे गरीब भाइयों-बहनों में है। कितनी ही ठंड क्‍यों न हो, वो मुठ्ठी बंद करके गुजारा कर सकता है। उसके भीतर यह सामर्थ्‍य है। आइये उस सामर्थ्‍य के हम पुजारी बनें और इसलिए उसकी रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी की कठिनाइयों को हम दूर करें।

क्‍या कारण है कि मेरे गरीब के पास शौचालय न हो, घर में बिजली न हो, रहने के लिए घर न हो, पानी की सुविधा न हो, बैंक में खाता न हो, कर्ज लेने के लिए साहूकारों के घर जा करके एक प्रकार से सब कुछ गिरवी रखना पड़ता हो। आइये, गरीबों के आत्‍म-सम्‍मान, आत्‍म-विश्‍वास को, उनके स्‍वाभिमान को ही आगे बढ़ाने के लिए, सामर्थ्‍य देने के लिए हम प्रयास करें। 

भाइयो-बहनो, आजादी के 70 साल हो गए। बहुत सारे काम सब सरकारों ने अपने-अपने तरीके से किए हैं। सरकार किसी भी दल की क्‍यों न हो, केंद्र की हो, राज्‍य की हो, हर किसी ने अपने-अपने तरीके से प्रयास किए हैं। लेकिन यह भी सच्‍चाई है कि आज हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में करीब-करीब आधे घर ऐसे हैं, जिन घरों में पीने का पानी उपलब्ध नहीं है। उनको पीने का पानी प्राप्‍त करने के लिए मशक्‍कत करनी पड़ती है। माताओं-बहनों कोसिर पर बोझ उठा करके, मटके लेकरदो-दो, तीन-तीन, पांच-पांचकिलोमीटर जाना पड़ता है। जीवन का बहुत सारा हिस्‍सा सिर्फ पानी में खप जाता हैऔर इसलिएइस सरकार ने एक विशेष काम की तरफ बल देने का निर्णय लिया है और वह है - हमारे हर घर में जल कैसे पहुंचे? हर घर को जल कैसे मिले? पीने का शुद्ध पानी कैसे मिले? और इसलिए आज मैं लाल किले से घोषणा करता हूं कि हम आने वाले दिनों में जल-जीवन मिशन को आगे ले करके बढ़ेंगे। यह जल-जीवन मिशन, इसके लिए केंद्र और राज्‍य सरकार साथ मिलकर काम करेंगे और आने वाले वर्षों में साढ़े तीन लाख करोड़ रुपये से भी ज्‍यादा रकम इस जल-जीवन मिशनके लिए खर्च करने का हमने संकल्‍प लिया है। जल संचय हो, जल सिंचन हो, वर्षा की बूंद-बूंद पानी को रोकने का काम हो, समुद्री पानी को या Waste Water को Treatment करने का विषय हो, किसानों के लिए ‘Per Drop, More Crop’, Micro Irrigation का काम हो, पानी बचाने का अभियान हो, पानी के प्रति सामान्‍य से सामान्‍य नागरिक सजग बने, संवेदनशील बने, पानी का महत्व समझें, हमारे शिक्षा कर्मों में भीबच्‍चों को भी बचपन से ही पानी के महत्व की शिक्षा दी जाए। पानी संग्रह के लिए, पानी के स्रोतों को पुनर्जीवित करने के लिए हम लगातार प्रयास करें और हम इस विश्‍वास के साथ आगे बढ़ें कि पानी के क्षेत्र में पिछले 70 साल में जो काम हुआ है, हमें 5 साल में चार गुना से भी ज्‍यादा उस काम को करना होगा। अब हम ज्‍यादा इंतजार नहीं कर सकते और इस देश के महान संत, सैकड़ों साल पहले,संत तिरुवल्लुवर जी ने उस समय एक महत्‍वपूर्ण बात कही थी, सैकड़ों साल पहले, तब तो शायद किसी ने पानी के संकट के बारे में सोचा भी नहीं होगा, पानी के महत्वके बारे में भी नहीं सोचा होगा, और तब संत तिरुवल्लुवर जी ने कहा था“नीर इन्ड़्री अमियादू, उल्ग:, नीर इन्ड़्री अमियादू, उल्ग:,” यानि जब पानी समाप्‍त हो जाता है, तो प्रकृति का कार्य थम जाता है, रूक जाता है। एक प्रकार से विनाश प्रारंभ हो जाता है।

मेरा जन्‍म गुजरात में हुआ, गुजरात में तीर्थ क्षेत्र है महुडी, जो उत्‍तरी गुजरात में है। जैन समुदाय के लोग वहां आते-जाते रहते हैं। आज से करीब 100 साल पहले वहां एक जैन मुनि हुए, वह किसान के घर में पैदा हुए थे, किसान थे, खेत में काम करते थे लेकिन जैन परंपरा के साथ जुड़ करके वह दीक्षित हुए और जैन-मुनि बने। 

करीब 100 साल पहले वह लिखकर गए हैं। बुद्धि सागर जी महाराज ने लिखा है कि एक दिन ऐसा आएगा, जब पानी किराने की दुकान में बिकेगा। आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं 100 साल पहले एक संत लिख कर गए कि पानी किराने की दुकान में बिकेगा और आज हम पीने का पानी किराने की दुकान से लेते हैं। हम कहां से कहां पहुंच गए।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, न हमें थकना है, न हमें थमना है, न हमें रूकना है और न हमें आगे बढ़ने से हिचकिचाना है। यह अभियान सरकारी नहीं बनना चाहिए। जल संचय का यह अभियान, जैसे स्‍वच्‍छता का अभियान चला था, जन सामान्‍य का अभियान बनना चाहिए। जन सामान्‍य के आदर्शों को लेकर, जन सामान्‍य की अपेक्षाओं को लेकर, जन सामान्‍य के सामर्थ्‍य को लेकर हमें आगे बढ़ना है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, अब हमारा देश उस दौर में पहुंचा है जिसमें बहुत-सी बातों से अब हमें अपने आपको छुपाए रखने की जरूरत नहीं है। चुनौतियों को सामने से स्‍वीकार करने का वक्‍त आ चुका है। कभी राजनीतिक नफा-नुकसान के इरादे से हम निर्णय करते हैं लेकिन इससे देश की भावी पीढ़ी का बहुत नुकसान होता है। 

वैसा ही एक विषय है जिसको मैं आज लाल किले से स्‍पष्‍ट करना चाहता हूं। और वह विषय है, हमारे यहां हो रहा बेतहाशा जनसंख्‍या विस्‍फोट।यह जनसंख्‍या विस्‍फोट हमारे लिए, हमारी आने वाली पीढ़ी के लिए अनेक नए संकट पैदा करता है लेकिन यह बात माननी होगी कि हमारे देश में एक जागरूक वर्ग है, जो इस बात को भली-भांति समझता है। वे अपने घर में शिशु को जन्‍म देने से पहले भली-भांति सोचता है कि मैं कहीं उसके साथ अन्‍याय तो नहीं कर दूंगा। उसकी जो मानवीय आवश्‍यकताएं हैं उनकी पूर्ति मैं कर पाऊंगा कि नहीं कर पाऊंगा, उसके जो सपने हैं, वो सपने पूरा करने के लिए मैं अपनी भूमिका अदा कर पाऊंगा कि नहीं कर पाऊंगा। इन सारे parameters से अपने परिवार का लेखा-जोखा लेकर हमारे देश में आज भी स्वः प्रेरणा से एक छोटा वर्ग परिवार को सीमित करके, अपने परिवार का भी भला करता है और देश का भला करने में बहुत बड़ा योगदान देता है। ये सभी सम्‍मान के अधिकारी हैं, ये आदर के अधिकारी हैं। छोटा परिवार रखकर भी वह देश भक्ति को ही प्रकट करते हैं। वो देशभक्ति को अभिव्‍यक्‍त करते हैं। मैं चाहूंगा कि हम सभी समाज के लोग इनके जीवन को बारीकी से देखें कि उन्‍होंने अपने परिवार में जनसंख्‍या वृद्धि से अपने-आपको बचा करके परिवार की कितनी सेवा की है। देखते ही देखते एक दो पीढ़ी नहीं, परिवार कैसे आगे बढ़ता चला गया है, बच्‍चों ने कैसे शिक्षा पाई है, वह परिवार बीमारी से मुक्‍त कैसे है, वह परिवार अपनी प्राथमिक आवश्‍यकताओं को कैसे बढ़िया ढंग से पूरा करता है।हम भी उनसे सीखें और हमारे घर में किसी भी शिशु के आने से पहले हम सोचें कि जो शिशु मेरे घर में आएगा, क्‍या उसकी आवश्‍यकताओं की पूर्ति के लिए मैंने अपने-आपको तैयार कर लिया है? क्‍या मैं उसको समाज के भरोसे ही छोड़ दूंगा? मैं उसको उसके नसीब पर ही छोड़ दूंगा? कोई मां-बाप ऐसा नहीं हो सकता है, जो अपने बच्‍चों को जन्म देकर इस प्रकार की जिंदगी जीने के लिए मजबूर होने दें और इसलिए एक सामाजिक जागरूकता की आवश्‍यकता है।

जिन लोगों ने यह बहुत बड़ी भूमिका अदा की है, उनके सम्‍मान की आवश्‍यकता है, और उन्‍हीं के प्रयासों के उदाहरण लेकर समाज के बाकी वर्ग, जो अभी भी इससे बाहर हैं, उनको जोड़कर जनसंख्‍या विस्‍फोट- इसकी हमें चिंता करनी ही होगी।

सरकारों को भी भिन्‍न-भिन्‍न योजनाओं के तहत आगे आना होगा। चाहे राज्‍य सरकार हो, केंद्र सरकार हो- हर किसी को इस दायित्‍व को निभाने के लिए कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर चलना होगा। हम अस्‍वस्‍थ समाज नहीं सोच सकते, हम अशिक्षित समाज नहीं सोच सकते। 21वीं सदी के भारत मेंसपनों को पूरा करने का सामर्थ्‍य व्‍यक्ति से शुरू होता है, परिवार से शुरू होता है लेकिन अगर आबादी शिक्षित नहीं है, तंदुरूस्‍त नहीं है, तो न ही वह घर सुखी होता है, न ही वह देश सुखी होता है।

जन आबादी शिक्षित हो, सामर्थ्‍यवान हो, Skilled हो और अपनी इच्‍छा और आवश्‍यकताओं की पूर्ति करने के लिए, उपयुक्‍त माहौल प्राप्‍त करने के लिए संसाधन उपलब्‍ध हों, तो मैं समझता हूं कि देश इन बातों को पूर्ण कर सकता है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, आप भलीभांति जानते हैं कि भ्रष्‍टाचार, भाई-भतीजावाद ने हमारे देश का कल्‍पना से परे नुकसान किया है और दीमक की तरह हमारे जीवन में घुस गया है। उसको बाहर निकालने के लिए हम लगातार प्रयास कर रहे हैं। सफलताएं भी मिली हैं, लेकिन बीमारी इतनी गहरी है, बीमारी इतनी फैली हुई है कि हमें और अधिक प्रयास, और वह भी सिर्फ सरकारी स्‍तर पर नहीं, हर स्‍तर पर करते ही रहना पड़ेगा, और ऐसा निरंतर करते रहना पड़ेगा।एक बार में सारा काम नहीं होता, बुरी आदतें - पुरानी बीमारी जैसी होती हैं, कभी ठीक हो जाती हैं, लेकिन मौका मिलते ही फिर से बीमारी आ जाती हैं। वैसे ही यह एक ऐसी बीमारी है, जिसको हमने निरंतर Technology का उपयोग करते हुए इसको निरस्‍त करने की दिशा में कई कदम उठाए हैं। हर स्‍तर पर ईमानदारी और पारदर्शिता को बल मिले, इसके लिए भी भरसक प्रयास किए गए हैं।

आपने देखा होगा पिछले पांच साल में भी, इस बार आते ही सरकार में बैठे हुए अच्‍छे-अच्‍छे लोगों की छुट्टी कर दी गई। हमारे इस अभियान में जो रुकावट बनते थे, उनसे कहा गया कि आप अपना कारोबार कर लीजिए, अब देश को आपकी सेवाओं की जरूरत नहीं है।

मैं स्‍पष्‍ट मानता हूं, व्‍यवस्‍थाओं में बदलाव होना चाहिए, लेकिन साथ-साथ सामाजिक जीवन में भी बदलाव होना चाहिए। सामाजिक जीवन में बदलाव होना चाहिए, उसके साथ-साथ व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को चलाने वाले लोगों के दिल-दिमाग में भी बदलाव बहुत अनिवार्य होता है। तभी जाकर हम इच्छित परिणामों को प्राप्‍त कर सकते हैं।

भाइयो और बहनो, देश आजादी के इतने साल बाद एक प्रकार से परिपक्‍व हुआ है। हम आजादी के 75 साल मनाने जा रहे हैं। तब यह आजादी सहज संस्कार, सहज स्वभाव, सहज अनुभूति, यह भी आवश्यक होती है। मैं अपने अफसरों के साथ जब बैठता हूं तो एक बात करता हूं, सार्वजनिक रूप से तो बोलता नहीं था लेकिन आज मन कर रहा है तो बोल ही दूं। मैं अपने अफसरों के बीच बार-बार कहता हूं कि क्या आजादी के इतने सालों के बाद रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी में, सरकारों का जो दखल है सामान्य नागरिक के जीवन में, क्या हम उस दखल को कम नहीं कर सकते?खत्म नहीं कर सकते हैं? आजाद भारत का मतलब मेरे लिए यह है कि धीरे-धीरे सरकारेंलोगों की जिंदगी से बाहर आएं, लोग अपनी जिंदगी के निर्णय करने के लिये आगे बढ़ने के लिये, सारे रास्ते उनके लिये खुले होने चाहिए, मन-मर्जी पड़े उस दिशा में, देश के हित में और परिवार की भलाई के लिये स्वयं के सपनों के लियेआगे बढ़ें, ऐसा Eco-systemहमको बनाना ही होगा। और इसलिये सरकार का दवाब नहीं होना चाहिए लेकिन साथ-साथ जहां मुसीबत के पल हों, तो सरकार का अभाव भी नहीं होना चाहिए। न सरकार का दवाब हो, न सरकार का अभाव हो, लेकिन हम सपनों को लेकर आगे बढ़ें। सरकार हमारे एक साथी के रूप मेंहर पल मौजूद हो। जरूरत पड़े तो लगना चाहिए कि हां कोई है, चिंता का विषय नहीं है।क्या उस प्रकार की व्यवस्थाएं हम विकसित कर सकते हैं?

हमने गैर-जरूरी कई कानूनों को खत्म किया है। गत 5 वर्ष में एक प्रकार से मैंने प्रतिदिन एक गैर-जरूरी कानून खत्म किया था। देश के लोगों तक शायद यह बात पहुंची नहीं होगी। हर दिन एक कानून खत्म किया था, करीब-करीब 1450 कानून खत्म किये थे। सामान्य मानव के जीवन से बोझ कम हो। अभी सरकार को 10 हफ्ते हुए, अभी तो इन 10 हफ्तों में 60 ऐसे कानूनों को खत्म कर दिया है। 

Ease of living यह आजाद भारत की आवश्यकता है और इसलिये हम Ease of living पर बल देना चाहते हैं, उसी को आगे ले जाना चाहते हैं।आज Ease of doing business में हम काफी प्रगति कर रहे हैं। पहले 50 में पहुंचने का सपना है, उसके लिये कई reform करने की जरूरत होगी, कई छोटी-मोटी रुकावटें हैं। कोई व्यक्ति छोटा सा उद्योग करना चाहता है या कोई छोटा-सा काम करना चाहता है, तो यहां form भरो, उधर form भरो, इधर जाओ, उस office जाओ, सैंकड़ों ऑफिसों में चक्कर लगाने जैसी परेशानियों में उलझा रहता है, उसका मेल ही नहीं बैठता है। इनको खत्म करते-करते, reform करते-करते, केंद्र और राज्यों को भी साथ लेते-लेते, नगरपालिका-महानगरपालिकाओं को भी साथ लेते-लेते, हम Ease of doing business के काम में बहुत कुछ करने में सफल हुये हैं। और दुनिया में भी विश्वास पैदा हुआ है कि भारत जैसा इतना बड़ा Developing देश इतना बड़ा सपना देख सकता है और इतनी बड़ी jump लगा सकता है। Ease of doing business तो एक पड़ाव है, मेरी मंजिल तो है Ease of living - सामान्य मानव के जीवन में उसको सरकारी काम में कोई मशक्कत न करनी पड़े, उसके हक उसको सहज रूप से मिले और इसलिए हमें आगे बढ़ने की जरूरत है, हम उस दिशा में काम करना चाहते हैं।

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, हमारा देश आगे बढ़े, लेकिन incremental progress, उसके लिये देश अब ज्यादा इंतजार नहीं कर सकता है, हमें high jump लगानी पड़ेंगी, हमें छलांग लगानी पड़ेगी, हमें हमारी सोच को भी बदलना पड़ेगा। भारत को Global benchmark के बराबर लाने के लिये हमारे आधुनिक infrastructure,उसकी ओर भी जाना पड़ेगा और कोई कुछ भी कहे कोई कुछ भी लिखे, लेकिन सामान्‍य मानव का सपना अच्‍छी व्‍यवस्‍थाओं का होता है। अच्‍छी चीज उसे अच्‍छी लगती हैं, उसकी उसमें रूचि बनती है। और इसलिए हमने तय किया है कि इन कालखंड में 100 लाख करोड़ रुपया आधुनिक Infrastructure के लिए लगाए जाएंगे, जिससे रोजगार भी मिलेगा, जीवन में भी नई व्‍यवस्‍था विकसित होंगी जो आवश्‍यकताओं की पूर्ति भी करेगी। चाहे सागरमाला प्रोजक्‍ट हो, चाहे भारतमाला प्रोजेक्‍ट हो, चाहे आधुनिक रेलवे स्‍टेशन बनाने हों या बस स्‍टेशन बनाने हों या एयरपोर्ट बनाने हों, चाहे आधुनिक अस्‍पताल बनाने हों, चाहे विश्‍व स्‍तर के educational institutions का निर्माण करना हो, infrastructure की दृष्टि से भी इन सभी चीजों को हम आगे बढ़ाना चाहते हैं। अब देश में seaport की भी आवश्‍यकता है। सामान्य जीवन का भी मन बदला है। हमें इसे समझना होगा।

पहले एक जमाना था कि अगर कागज पर सिर्फ निर्णय हो जाए कि एक रेलवे स्‍टेशन फलाना इलाके में बनने वाला है, तो महीनों तक, सालों तक एक सकारात्‍मक गूंज बनी रहती थी कि चलो हमारे यहां नजदीक में अब नया रेलवे स्‍टेशन आ रहा है। आज वक्‍त बदल चुका है। आज सामान्‍य नागरिक रेलवे स्‍टेशन मिलने से संतुष्‍ट नहीं है, वो तुरंत पूछता है, वंदे भारत एक्सप्रेस हमारे इलाके में कब आएगी? उसकी सोच बदल गई है। अगर हम एक बढ़िया से बढ़िया बस स्‍टेशन बना दें, FIVE STAR रेलवे स्‍टेशन बना दें तो वहां का नागरिक ये नहीं कहता है साहब आज बहुत बढ़िया काम किया है। वो तुरंत कहता है- साहब हवाई अड्डा कब आएगा? यानी अब उसकी सोच बदल चुकी है। कभी रेलवे के stoppage से संतुष्‍ट होने वाला मेरा देश का नागरि‍क बढ़िया से बढ़िया रेलवे स्‍टेशन मिलने के बाद तुरंत कहता है- साहब बाकी तो ठीक है, हवाई अड्डा कब आएगा?

पहले किसी भी नागरिक को मिलें तो कहता था- साहब, पक्‍की सड़क कब आएगी? हमारे यहां पक्‍की सड़क कब बनेगी? आज कोई मिलता है तो तुरंत कहता है- साहब, 4 lane वाला रोड बनेगा कि 6 lane वाला? सिर्फ पक्‍की सड़क तक वो सीमित रहना नहीं चाहता और मैं मानता हूं आकांक्षी भारत के लिए ये बहुत बड़ी बात होती है।

पहले गांव के बाहर बिजली का खंभा ऐसे ही नीचे लाकर सुला दिया हो तो लोग कहते हैं कि चलो भाई बिजली आई, अभी तो खंभा नीचे पड़ा हुआ है, गाड़ा भी नहीं है। आज बिजली के तार भी लग जाएं, घर में मीटर भी लग जाएं तो वो पूछता है- साहब, 24 घंटे बिजली कब आएगी? अब वो खंभे, तार और मीटर से संतुष्‍ट नहीं है।

पहले जब मोबाइल आया, तो उनको लगता था मोबाइल फोन आ गया। वो एक संतोष का अनुभव करता था। लेकिन आज वो तुरंत चर्चा करने लगता है कि data की speed क्‍या है?

ये बदलते हुए मिजाज को, बदलते हुए वक्‍त को हमें समझना होगा और उसी प्रकार से Global Benchmark के साथ हमें अपने देश को आधुनिक infrastructure के साथ - clean energy हो, gas based economy हो, gas grid हो, e-mobility हो, ऐसे अनेक क्षेत्रों में हमें आगे बढ़ना है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, आमतौर पर हमारे देश में सरकारों की पहचान ये बनती रही कि सरकार ने फलाने इलाके के लिए क्‍या किया, फलाने वर्ग के लिए क्‍या किया, फलाने समूह के लिए क्‍या किया? आमतौर पर क्‍या दिया, कितना दिया, किसको दिया, किसको मिला, उसी के आसपास सरकार और जनमानस चलते रहे और उसको अच्‍छा भी माना गया। मैं भी, शायद उस समय की मांग रही होगी, आवश्यकता रही होगी लेकिन अब किस को क्‍या मिला, कैसे मिला, कब मिला, कितना मिला। इन सबके रहते हुए भी हम सब मिल करके देश को कहां ले जाएंगे, हम सब मिल करके देश को कहां पहुंचाएगे, हम सब मिल करके देश के लिए क्‍या achieve करेंगे, इन सपनों को ले करके जीना, जूझना और चल पड़ना ये समय की मांग है। और इसलिए 5 Trillion Dollar Economy का सपना संजोया है। 130 करोड़ देशवासी अगर छोटी-छोटी चीजों को लेकर चल पड़े तो 5 Trillion Dollar Economy, कई लोंगो को मुश्किल लगता है, वो गलत नहीं हो सकते, लेकिन अगर मुश्किल काम नहीं करेंगे तो देश आगे कैसे बढेगा? मुश्किल चुनौतियों को नहीं उठाएंगे तो चलने का मिजाज़ कहां से बनेगा? मनोवैज्ञानिक दृष्टि से भी हमें हमेशा ऊंचे निशान रखने चाहिए और हमने रखा है। लेकिन वो हवा में नहीं है। आजादी के 70 साल बाद हम दो Trillion Dollar Economy पर पहुंचे थे, 70 साल की विकास यात्रा ने हमें दो Trillion Dollar Economy पर पहुंचाया था। लेकिन 2014 से 2019, पांच साल के भीतर-भीतर हम लोग दो Trillion से तीन Trillion पहुंच गए, एक Trillion Dollar हमने जोड़ दिया। अगर पांच साल में, 70 साल में जो हुआ उसमें इतना बड़ा jump लगाया तो आने वाले पांच साल में हम 5 Trillion Dollar Economy बन सकते है, और ये सपना हर हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी का होना चाहिए। जब Economy बढ़ती है तो जीवन भी बेहतर बनाने की सुविधा बनती है। छोटे-से-छोटे व्‍यक्ति के सपनों को साकार करने के लिए अवसर पैदा होते हैं। और ये अवसर पैदा करने के लिए देश के आर्थिक क्षेत्र में हमें इस बात को आगे ले जाना है।

जब हम सपना देखते हैं कि देश के किसान की आय दो गुनी होनी चाहिए, जब हम सपना देखते है कि आजादी के 75 साल में हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में कोई परिवार, गरीब से गरीब भी, उसका पक्‍का घर होना चाहिए। जब हम सपना देखते हैं कि आजादी के 75 साल हों तब देश के हर परिवार के पास बिजली होनी चाहिए, जब हम सपना देखते है कि आजादी के 75 साल हो, तब हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर गांव में Optical Fiber Network हो, Broadband की Connectivity हो, Long Distance Education की सुविधा हो। 

हमारी समुद्री संपत्ति, Blue Economy इस क्षेत्र को हम बल दें। हमारे मछुआरे भाइयों-बहनों को हम ताकत दें। हमारे किसान अन्‍नदाता है, ऊर्जादाता बनें। हमारे किसान, ये भी Exporter क्‍यों न बनें। दुनिया के अंदर हमारे किसानों के द्वारा पैदा की हुई चीजों का डंका क्यों न बजे। इन सपनों को ले करके हम चलना चाहते हैं। हमारे देश को Export बढ़ाना ही होगा, हम सिर्फ दुनिया, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान को बाजार बना करके देखे, हम भी दुनिया के बाजार में पहुंचने के लिए भरसक प्रयास करें।

हमारे हर District में दुनिया के एक-एक देश की जो ताकत होती है, छोटे-छोटे देशों की, वो ताकत हमारे एक-एक District में होती है। हमें इस सामर्थ्‍य को समझना है, इस सामर्थ्‍य को हमें Channelize करना है और हमारे हर जिले Export Hub बनने की दिशा में क्‍यों न सोचें, हर जिले का अपना Handicraft है, हर जिले के अंदर अपनी-अपनी विशेषताएं हैं। अगर किसी जिले के पास इत्र की पहचान है, तो किसी जिले के पास साड़ियों की पहचान है, किसी जिले के बर्तन मशहूर है, तो किसी जिले में मिठाई मशहूर है। हर एक के पास विविधता है, सामर्थ्‍य है, हमने Global Market के लिएzero defect, zero effect से उसका manufacturing कैसे हो और इस विविधता से दुनिया को परिचित कराते हुए अगर हम उसके export पर बल देंगे, दुनिया के मार्केट को capture करने की दिशा में हम काम करेंगे, तो देश के नौजवानों को रोजगार मिलेगा। हमारे small scale industries को, micro level industries को इसके कारण एक बहुत बड़ी ताकत मिलेगी और हमें उस ताकत को बढ़ाना है।

हमारा देश Tourist Destination के लिए दुनिया के लिए अजूबा हो सकता है, लेकिन किसी न किसी कारण से जितनी तेजी से हमें वह काम करना चाहिए, वो हम नहीं कर पाए हैं। आइये, हम सभी देशवासी तय करें कि हमें देश के tourism पर बल देना है। जब tourism बढ़ता है, कम से कम पूंजी‍निवेश में ज्‍यादा से ज्‍यादा रोजगार मिलता है। देश की economy को बल मिलता है और दुनियाभर के लोग आज भारत को नये सिरे से देखने के लिए तैयार हैं। हम सोचें कि दुनिया हमारे देश में कैसे आए, हमारे tourism के क्षेत्र को कैसे बल मिले और इसके लिए Tourist Destination की व्‍यवस्‍था हो, सामान्‍य मानव की आमदनी बढ़ाने की बात हो, बेहतर शिक्षा, नये रोजगार के अवसर प्राप्‍त हों, मध्‍यम वर्ग के लोगों के बेहतर सपनों को साकार करने के लिए, ऊंची उड़ान के लिए सारे launching pad उनके लिए available होने चाहिए। हमारे वैज्ञानिकों के पास बेहतर संसाधनों की पूरी सुविधा हो, हमारी सेना के पास बेहतर इंतजाम हो, वो भी देश में बना हुआ हो, तो मैं मानता हूं ऐसे अनेक क्षेत्र हैं जो 5 trillion dollar economy के लिए भारत को एक नई शक्ति दे सकते हैं।

मेरे प्‍यारे भाइयो-बहनो, आज देश में आर्थिक सिद्धि प्राप्‍त करने के लिए बहुत ही अनुकूल वातावरण है।जब Government stable होती है, policy predictable होती है, व्‍यवस्‍थाएं stable होती है तो दुनिया का भी एक भरोसा बनता है। देश की जनता ने यह काम करके दिखाया है। विश्‍व भी भारत की political stability को बड़े गर्व और आदर के साथ देख रहा है। हमें इस अवसर को जाने नहीं देना चाहिए। आज विश्‍व हमारे साथ व्यापार करने को उत्‍सुक है। वह हमारे साथ जुड़ना चाहता है। आज हमारे लिए गर्व का विषय है कि महंगाई को control करते हुए हम विकास दर को बढ़ाने वाले एक महत्‍वपूर्ण समीकरण को ले करके चले हैं। कभी विकास दर तो बढ़ जाती है, लेकिन महंगाई control में नहीं रहती है। कभी महंगाई बढ़ जाती है तो विकास दर का ठिकाना नहीं होता है। लेकिन यह ऐसी सरकार है जिसने महंगाई को control भी किया और विकास दर को आगे भी बढ़ाया।

हमारे अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था के fundamentals बहुत मजबूत हैं। यह मजबूती हमें आगे ले जाने के लिए भरोसा देती है। उसी प्रकार से जीएसटी जैसी व्‍यवस्‍था विकसित करके, IBC जैसे reform लाना अपने आप में एक नया विश्‍वास पैदा करना चाहते हैं। हमारे देश में उत्‍पादन बढ़े, हमारी प्राकृतिक संपदा की processing बढ़ें, value addition हो, value addition वाली चीजें दुनिया के अंदर export हों और दुनिया के अनेक देशों तक export हों। हम क्‍यों न सपना देखें कि दुनिया का कोई देश ऐसा नही होगा, जहां कोई न कोई चीज भारत से न जाती हों, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का कोई जिला ऐसा नहीं होगा जहां से कुछ न कुछ export न होता हो। अगर इन दोनों चीजों को लेकर हम चले, तो हम आमदनी भी बढ़ा सकते हैं। हमारी कंपनियां, हमारे उद्यमी वे भी दुनिया के बाजार में जाने के सपने देखते हैं। दुनिया के बाजार में जाकर भारत के रुतबे को वहां आवाज देने की ताकत दें, हमारे निवेशक ज्‍यादा कमाएं, हमारे निवेशक ज्‍यादा निवेश करें, हमारे निवेशक ज्‍यादा रोजगार पैदा करें -  इसको प्रोत्‍साहन देने के लिए हम पूरी तरह से आगे आने को तैयार हैं।

हमारे देश में कुछ ऐसी गलत मान्‍यताओं ने घर कर लिया है। उन मान्‍यताओं से बाहर निकलना पड़ेगा। जो देश की wealth को create करता है, जो देश की wealth creation में contribute करता है, वे सब देश की सेवा कर रहे हैं। हम wealth creator को आशंका की नजरों से न देखें,उनके प्रति हीन भाव से न देखें। आवश्‍यकता है देश में wealth create करने वालों का भी उतना ही मान-सम्‍मान और प्रोत्‍साहन होना चाहिए। उनका गौरव बढ़ना चाहिए और wealth create नहीं होगी तो wealth distribute भी नहीं होगी। अगर wealth distribute नहीं होगी तो देश के गरीब आदमी की भलाई नहीं होगी। और इसलिए तो wealth creation, यह भी हमारे जैसे देश के लिए एक महत्‍वपूर्ण अहमियत रखता है और उसको भी हमें आगे ले जाना है। जो लोग wealth create करने में लगे हैं, मेरे लिए वह भी हमारे देश की wealth हैं। उनका सम्‍मान और उनका गौरव इस कदम को नई ताकत देगा। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, आज शांति और सुरक्षा विकास के अनिवार्य पहलू हैं। दुनिया आज असुरक्षा से घिरी हुई है। दुनिया के किसी न किसी भाग में, किसी न किसी रूप में मौत का साया मंडरा रहा है। विश्‍व शांति की समृद्धि के लिए भारत को अपनी भूमिका अदा करनी होगी। वैश्विक परिवेश में भारत मूकदर्शक बनकर नहीं रह सकता है और भारत आतंक फैलाने वालों के खिलाफ मजबूती के साथ लड़ रहा है। विश्‍व के किसी भी कोने में आतंक की घटना मानवतावाद के खिलाफ छेड़ा हुआ युद्ध है। इसलिए यह आह्वान है कि विश्वभर की मानवतावादी शक्तियां एक हों। आतंकवाद को पनाह देने वाले, आतंकवाद को प्रोत्‍साहन देने वाले, आतंकवाद को export करने वाले, ऐसी सारी ताकतों को दुनिया के सामने उनके सही स्‍वरूप में प्रस्‍तुत करते हुए दुनिया की ताकत को जोड़कर आतंकवाद को नष्‍ट करने के प्रयासों में भारत अपनी भूमिका अदा करें, हम यही चाहते हैं।

कुछ लोगों ने सिर्फ भारत को ही नहीं हमारे पड़ोस के देशों को भी आतंकवाद से तबाह करके रखा हुआ है। बांग्लादेश भी आतंकवाद से जूझ रहा है, अफगानिस्‍तान भी आतंकवाद से जूझ रहा है। श्रीलंका के अंदर चर्च में बैठे हुए निर्दोष लोगों को मौत के घाट उतार दिया गया। कितनी बड़ी दर्दनाक बाते हैं और इसलिए आतंकवाद के खिलाफ जब हम लड़ाई लड़ते हैं तब हम इस पूरे भू-भाग की शांति और सुरक्षा के लिए भी हमारी भूमिका अदा करने के लिए भी सक्रिय काम कर रहे हैं। 

हमारा पड़ोसी, हमारा एक अच्‍छा मित्र अफगानिस्‍तान चार दिन के बाद अपनी आजादी का जश्‍न मनाएगा और यह उनकी आजादी का 100वां साल है।मैं आज लाल किले से अफगानिस्‍तान के मेरे मित्रों को, जो चार दिन के बाद 100वीं आजादी का उत्‍सव मनाने जा रहें हैं, अनेक-अनेक शुभकानाएं देता हूं।

आतंक और हिंसा का माहौल बनाने वालों को, उनको फैलाने वालों को, भय का वातारवरण पैदा करने वालों को नेस्तानाबूत करना सरकार की नीति, सरकार की रणनीति और उसमें हमारी स्‍पष्‍टता साफ है। हमें कोई हिचकिचाहट नहीं है। हमारे सैनिकों ने, हमारे सुरक्षा बलों ने, सुरक्षा एजेंसियों ने बहुत प्रशंसनीय काम किया है। संकट की घड़ी में भी देश को शांति देने के लिए यूनिफार्म में खड़े हुए सब लोगों ने आज अपने जीवन की आहूति देकर हमारे कल को रोशन करने के लिए जीवन खपाया है। मैं उन सबको salute करता हूं। मैं उनको नमन करता हूं। लेकिन समय रहते Reform की भी बहुत आवश्‍यकता होती है।

आपने देखा होगा हमारे देश में सैन्‍य व्‍यवस्‍था, सैन्‍य शक्ति, सैन्‍य संसाधन - उसके Reform पर लंबे अरसे से चर्चा चल रही है। अनेक सरकारों ने इसकी चर्चा की है। अनेक commission बैठे हैं, अनेक रिपोर्ट आई हैं और सारे रिपोर्ट करीब-करीब एक ही स्‍वर को उजागर करते रहे हैं।19- 20 का फर्क है, ज्‍यादा फर्क नहीं है, लेकिन इन बातों को लगातार कहा गया है। हमारी तीनों सेना - जल, थल, नभ, उनके बीच coordination तो है, हम गर्व कर सकें, ऐसी हमारी सेना की व्‍यवस्‍था है। किसी भी हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी को गर्व हो, ऐसा हो। वे अपने-अपने तरीके से आधुनिकता के लिए भी प्रयास करते हैं।लेकिन आज जैसे दुनिया बदल रही है, आज युद्ध के दायरे बदल रहे हैं, रूप-रंग बदल रहे हैं। आज जिस प्रकार से Technology Driven व्‍यवस्‍थाएं बन रही हैं, तब भारत को भी टुकड़ों में भी सोचने से नहीं चलेगा। हमारी पूरी सैन्‍यशक्ति को एकमुश्‍त होकर एक साथ आगे बढ़ने की दिशा में काम करना होगा। जल, थल, नभ में से एक आगे रहे दूसरा दो कदम पीछे रहे, तीसरा तीन कदम पीछे रहे, तो नहीं चल सकता। तीनों एक साथ एक ही ऊंचाई पर आगे बढ़ें। coordination अच्‍छा हो, सामान्‍य मानव की आशा-आकांक्षाओं के अनुरूप हों, विश्‍व में बदलते हुए युद्ध के और सुरक्षा के माहौल के अनुरूप हो, इन बातों को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए आज मैं लाल किले से एक महत्‍वपूर्ण निर्णय की घोषणा करना चाहता हूं। इस विषय के जो जानकार हैं, वह बहुत लम्‍बे अर्से से इसकी मांग करते रहे हैं।

आज हमने निर्णय किया है कि अब हम Chief of defense - CDS की व्‍यवस्‍था करेंगे और इस पद के गठन के बाद तीनों सेनाओं को शीर्ष स्‍तर पर प्रभावी नेतृत्‍व मिलेगा। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की सामरिक दुनिया की गति में ये CDS एक बहुत अहम और reform करने का जो हमारा सपना है, उसके लिए बल देने वाला काम है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, हम लोग भाग्‍यवान हैं कि हम एक ऐसे कालखंड में जन्‍मे हैं, हम एक ऐसे कालखंड में जी रहे हैं, हम एक ऐसे कालखंड में हैं जब हम कुछ न कुछ करने का सामर्थ्‍य रखते हैं। कभी-कभी मन में हमेशा रहता है कि जब आजादी की जंग चल रही थी, भगतसिंह, सुखदेव, राजगुरू जैसे महापुरुष अपने बलिदान के लिए स्‍पर्धा कर रहे थे। महात्‍मा गांधी के नेतृत्‍व में आजादी के दीवाने घर-घर, गली-गली जा करके आजादी के सपनों का साकार करने के लिए देश को जगा रहे थे। हम उस समय नहीं थे, हम पैदा नहीं हुए थे, देश के लिए हमें मरने का मौका नहीं मिला,लेकिन देश के लिए जीने का मौका जरूर मिला है। और ये सौभाग्‍य है कि ये कालखंड ऐसा है, ये वर्ष हमारे लिए बहुत महत्‍वपूर्ण है। पूज्‍य बापू महात्‍मा गांधी, इनकी 150वीं जन्‍म-जयंती का ये पर्व है। ऐसे अवसर हमें अपने कालखंड में मिले, ये अपने-आप में हमारा सौभाग्‍य है। और दूसरा हमारी आजादी के 75 साल, देश की आजादी के लिए मर-मिटने वालों का स्‍मरण हमें कुछ करने की प्रेरणा देता है। इस अवसर को हमें खोने नहीं देना है। 130 करोड़ देशवासियों के हृदय में महात्‍मा गांधी के सपनों के अनुरूप, देश की आजादी के दीवानों के सपनों के अनुरूप आजादी के 75 साल और गांधी के 150 साल, इस पर्व को हमारी प्रेरणा का महान अवसर बना करके हमें आगे बढ़ना है।

मैंने इसी लाल किले से 2014 में स्‍वच्‍छता के लिए बात कही थी। 2019 में कुछ ही सप्‍ताह के बाद, मुझे विश्‍वास है, भारत अपने-आपको open defecation free घोषित कर पाएगा। राज्‍यों ने, गांवों ने, नगर पालिकाओं ने- सबने, मीडिया ने जन-आंदोलन खड़ा कर दिया। सरकार कहीं नजर नहीं आई, लोगों ने उठा लिया और परिणाम सामने हैं।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, मैं एक छोटी-सी अपेक्षा आज आपके सामने रखना चाहता हूं। इस 02 अक्‍तूबर को हम भारत को single use plastic, क्‍या इससे देश को मुक्ति दिला सकते हैं। हम निकल पड़ें, टोलियां बना करके निकल पड़े school, college हम सब पूज्‍य बापू को याद करते हुए और घर में प्‍लास्टिक हो - single use plastic या बाहर चौहराएं पर पड़ा हो, गंदी नाली में पड़ा हो, वह सब इकट्ठा करें, नगरपालिकाएं, महानगर-पालिकाएं, ग्राम पंचायत सब इसको जमा करने की व्‍यवस्‍था करें। हम प्‍लास्टिक को विदाई देने की दिशा में 2 अक्‍टूबर को पहला मजबूत कदम उठा सकते हैं क्‍या?

आइए मेरे देशवासियो, हम इसको आगे बढ़ाएं।और फिर मैं Start-up वालों को, Technician को, उद्यमियों को आग्रह करता हूं कि हम इन प्लास्टिक के Recycle के लिये क्या करें? जैसे highways बनाने के लिये प्लास्टिक का उपयोग हो रहा है। ऐसी बहुत-सी विधाएं हो सकती हैं, लेकिन जिसके कारण अनेक समस्याएं पैदा हो रही हैं, उससे मुक्ति के लिये हमें ही अभियान छेड़ना होगा। लेकिन साथ-साथ हमें alternate व्यवस्थाएं भी देनी पड़ेंगी। मैं तो सभी दुकानदानों से आग्रह करूंगा, आप अपने दुकान पर हमेशा Board लगाते हैं, एक Board यह भी लगा दीजिये, कृपा करके हमसे प्लास्टिक की थैली की अपेक्षा न करें। आप अपने घर से कपड़े का थैला लेकर आइए या तो हम कपड़े का थैला भी बेचेंगे, ले जाइये। हम एक वातावरण बनायें। दीवाली पर जहां हम लोगों को भांति-भांति के गिफ्ट देते हैं, क्यों न इस बार और हर बार कपड़े के थैले लोगों को गिफ्ट करें, ताकि कोई कपड़े का थैला लेकर मार्किट जायेगा, तो आपकी company की advertisement भी होगी। आप सिर्फ डायरी देते हैं, तो शायद कुछ नहीं होता है, Calendar देते हैं तो कुछ नहीं होता है, थैला देंगे, तो जहां जायेगा तो थैला आपकी advertise भी करता रहेगा। जूट के थैले हों, मेरे किसानों को मदद करेगा, कपड़े के थैले हों, मेरे किसान को मदद मिलेगी। छोटे-छोटे काम हैं। गरीब-विधवा मां जो सिलाई करती होगी, उसको मदद करेगा यानी हमारा छोटा सा निर्णय भी सामान्य मानव के जीवन में किस प्रकार से बदलाव ला सकता है, हम उस दिशा में काम करें।

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो Five trillion Dollar economy का सपना हो, स्वावलंबी भारत का सपना हो, महात्मा गांधी के आदर्शों को जीना आज भी प्रस्तुत है। महात्मा गांधी के विचार आज भी स्तुत्य हैं और इसलिये Make in India का जो मिशन हमने लिया है, उसे हमें आगे बढ़ाना है। Made in India Product, हमारी प्राथमिकता क्यों न होनी चाहिए? हम तय करें अपने जीवन में मेरे देश में जो बनता है, मिलता है, वो मेरी प्राथमिकता होगी और हमें तो lucky कल के लिये.... lucky कल के लिये local product पर बल देना है। lucky कल के लिये local, सुहानी कल के लिये local, उज्ज्वल कल के लिये local, जो गांव में बनता है पहले उसके लिये प्राथमिकता होनी चाहिये। वहां नहीं तो तहसील में, तहसील से बाहर जाना पड़े तो, जिले में, जिले के बाहर जाना पड़े तो, राज्य में और मैं नहीं मानता हूं कि उसके बाद अपनी आवश्यकताओं के लिये कहीं जाना पड़ेगा। कितना बड़ा बल मिलेगा? हमारी ग्रामीण अर्थव्यवस्था को कितना बल मिलेगा?, लघु उद्यमियों को कितना बल मिलेगा?, हमारी परंपरागत चीजों को कितना बल मिलेगा? भाइयों-बहनों हमें Mobile phone अच्छा लगता है, हमें whatsapp भेजना अच्छा लगता है, हमें facebook-twitter पर रहना अच्छा लगता है, लेकिन देश की Economy में भी इसके कारण हम मदद कर सकते हैं। जानकारियों के लिये technology का जितना उपयोग है, आधुनिक भारत के निर्माण के लिये भी technologyका उतना ही उपयोग है और हम सामान्य नागरिक Digital payment के लिये क्यूं न चलें? आज हमें गर्व है कि हमारा Rupay card सिंगापुर में चल रहा है, हमारे Rupay card आने वाले दिनों में और देशों में भी चलने वाला है। हमारा एकdigital platform बड़ी मजबूती के साथ उभर रहा है, लेकिन हमारे गांव में, छोटी-छोटी दुकानों में भी, हमारे शहर के छोटे-छोटे मॉल में भी हम क्यूं न Digital payment पर बल दें? आइए ईमानदारी के लिये, Transparency के लिये और देश की Economy को ताकत देने के लिये हम Digital payment को अपनाएं। और मैं तो व्यापारियों को कहूंगा, आप board लगाते हैं ज्यादातर गांव में जाओगे व्यापारियों के board होते हैं - आज नकद-कल उधार। मैं चाहता हूं कि अब तो हमें board लगाया जाना चाहिए Digital payment को हां नकद को ना, यह एक माहौल बनाना चाहिए। मैं Banking क्षेत्र से आग्रह करता हूं, मैं व्यापार जगत के लोगों से आग्रह करता हूं कि आइये हम इन चीजों पर बल दें।

हमारे देश में Middle class, Higher Middle class का bulk बढ़ता जा रहा है, अच्छी बात है। साल में एक-दो बार परिवार के साथ, बच्चों के साथ दुनिया के अलग-अलग देशों में tourist के रूप में भी जाते हैं,बच्‍चों को exposure मिलता है। अच्‍छी बात है। लेकिन मैं आज ऐसे सभी परिवारों से आग्रह करता हूं, देश के लिए जब देश आजादी का 75 साल मना रहा है, देश के लिए इतने महापुरुषों ने बलिदान दिए हैं तब, जिंदगी खपा दी है तब क्‍या आप नहीं चाहते हैं कि आपकी संतान भी हमारे देश की बारीकियों को समझे। कौन मां-बाप नहीं चाहेगा कि हमारी-आपकी आने वाली पीढ़ी भावनात्मक रूप से इस मिट्टी से जुड़े, इसके इतिहास से जुड़े, इसकी हवाओं से, इसके पानी से नई ऊर्जा प्राप्‍त करें। ये हमें प्रयत्‍न पूर्वक करना चाहिए। हम कितने ही आगे बढ़े लेकिन जड़ों से कटना हमें कभी भी बचा नहीं सकता है, बढ़ा नहीं सकता है। और इसलिए जो दुनिया में Tourist  के रूप में भले ही जाते हों, क्‍या मैं आपसे एक चीज मांग सकता हूं, लालकिले से देश के नौजवानों के रोजगार के लिए, विश्‍व में भारत की पहचान बनाने के लिए, भारत का सामर्थ्‍य उजागर करने के लिए मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो आज मैं आपसे एक छोटी- सी मांग कर रहा हूं - क्या आप तय कर सकते हैं कि 2022 आजादी के 75 साल के पहले हम अपने परिवार के साथ भारत के कम से कम 15 tourist destinations पर जाएंगे। वहां कठिनाईयां होंगी तो भी जाएंगे। वहां अच्छे होटल नहीं होंगे तो भी जाएंगे। कभी-कभी कठिनाईयां भी जिदंगी जीने के लिए काम आती हैं। हम बच्‍चों में आदत डालें यही हमारा देश है। एक बार जाना शुरू करेंगे तो वहां व्‍यवस्‍थाएं विकसित करने वाले लोग भी आने लग जाएंगे। क्‍यों न हमारे देश में 100 ऐसे बढि़या tourist destination develop न करें, क्‍यों न हर राज्‍य में 2 या 5 या 7 top class tourist destination तैयार करें target करके तैयार करें। हम तय करें- हमारे North-east में इतनी प्राकृतिक संपदा है लेकिन कितनी यूनिवसिर्टीज होंगी जो अपना tourist destination north-east को बनाती हैं? ज्‍यादा contribute नहीं करना पड़ता है। आपको 7 दिन, 10 दिन निकालने हैं लेकिन देश के भीतर ही निकालिए। 

आप देखिए आप जहां जाकर आएंगे, वहां नई दुनिया खड़ी करके आएंगे, बीज रोपित करके आ जाएंगे और जीवन में आपको भी संतोष मिलेगा। हिंदुस्‍तान के लोग जाना शुरू करें तो दुनिया के लोग भी आना शुरू करेंगे। हम दुनिया में जाएंगे और कहेंगे कि आपने वो देखा है? कोई tourist हमसे पूछेगा कि आप हिन्‍दुस्‍तान से आ रहे है, आपने तमिलनाडू का वो temple देखा है? और हम कहेंगे कि मैं नहीं गया तो वो हमें कहेगा कि भाई कमाल है मैं तो तुम्‍हारे देश में तमिलनाडू के मंदिर देखने चला गया था और तुम यहां देखने आए हो। हम दुनिया में जाएं अपने देश को जानने के बाद जाएं। हम इतना काम कर सकते हैं।

मैं, मेरे किसान भाईयों से आज आग्रह करना चाहता हूं। आपसे मैं कुछ मांगना चाहता हूं। मेरे किसान के लिए, मेरे देशवासियों के लिए, ये धरती हमारी मां हैं। भारत माता की जय बोलते ही हमारे भीतर ऊर्जा का संचार होता है।वंदे मातरम बोलते ही इस धरती मां के लिए खप जाने की प्रेरणा मिलती है। एक दीर्घकालिक इतिहास हमारे सामने आता है लेकिन क्‍या कभी हमने इस धरती मां के स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य की चिंता की है। हम जिस प्रकार से chemical का उपयोग कर रहे हैं chemical fertilizer का उपयोग कर रहे हैं pesticides का उपयोग कर रहे हैं। हम हमारी इस धरती मां को तबाह कर रहे हैं। इस मां के संतान के रूप में, एक किसान के रूप में मुझे मेरी धरती मां को तबाह करने का हक नहीं है। मेरी धरती मां को दुखी करने का हक नहीं है, मेरी धरती मां को बीमार बना देने का हक नहीं है। 

आइए, आजादी के 75 साल होने जा रहे हैं।पूज्‍य बापू ने हमें रास्‍ता दिखाया है क्‍या हम 10 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent अपने खेत में यह chemical fertilizer को कम करेंगे, हो सके तो मुक्तिकर अभियान चलाएंगे। आप देखिए देश की कितनी बड़ी सेवा होगी। हमारी धरती मां को बचाने में, आपका कितना बड़ा योगदान होगा। वन्‍दे मातरम् कहकरजो फांसी के तख्‍त पर चढ़ गया था, उसके सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए, यह धरती मां को बचाने का आपका काम, उसका भी आशीर्वाद प्राप्‍त करेगा, जो कभी फांसी के तख्‍त पर चढ़ करके वंदे मातरम् कहा करता था। इसलिए मैं आपसे आग्रह करता हूं और मुझे विश्‍वास है कि मेरे देशवासी यह करके रहेंगे। मेरे किसान मेरी इस मांग को पूरा करेंगे यह मुझे पूरा विश्‍वास है।

मेरे प्‍यारे भाइयो-बहनो, हमारे देश के professionals उनकी आज पूरी दुनिया में गूंज है। उनके सामर्थ्‍य की चर्चा है। लोग उनका लोहा मानते हैं। Space हो, technology हो, हमने नये मुकाम प्राप्‍त किए हैं। हमारे लिए खुशी की बात है कि हमारा चंद्रयान तेजी से चांद के उस छोर की ओर आगे बढ़ रहा है, जहां अब तक कोई नहीं गया है। हमारे वैज्ञानिकों की सिद्धि है।

उसी प्रकार से खेल के मैदानों में हम बहुत कम नजर आते थे। आज दुनिया के खेल के मैदानों में मेरे देश के 18-20 साल, 22 साल के बेटे-बेटियां हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का तिरंगा झंडा फहरा रही हैं। कितना गर्व होता है। देश के खिलाड़ी देश का नाम रोशन कर रहे हैं।

मेरे देशवासियो, हमें हमारे देश को आगे बढ़ाना है। हमें हमारे देश में बदलाव लाना है। हमें देश में नई ऊंचाइयों को पार करना है और मिल-जुलकर करना है। सरकार और जनता को मिलकर करना है। 130 करोड़ देशवासियो ने करना है। देश का प्रधानमंत्री भी आपकी की तरह इस देश का एक बालक है, इस देश का एक नागरिक है। हम सबको मिलकर करना है।

चाहे आने वाले दिनों में गांव में डेढ़ लाख wellness center बनाने होंगे, health center बनाने होंगे, हर तीन लोकसभा के बीच एक medical college हमारे नौजवानों को डॉक्‍टर बनने का सपना पूरा कराना है। दो करोड़ से अधिक गरीब लोगों के लिए घर बनाने हैं। हमें 15 करोड़ ग्रामीण घरों में पीने का पानी पहुंचाना है। सवा लाख किलोमीटर गांव की सड़के बनानी हैं। हर गांव को Broadband connectivity, optical fiber network से जोड़ना है। 50 हजार से ज्‍यादा नये start up का जाल बिछाना है। अनेक सपनों को ले करके आगे बढ़ना है।इसलिए भाइयो-बहनो, हमें देशवासियों ने मिल करके, सपनों को ले करके देश को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए चलना है और आजादी के 75 साल इसके लिए बहुत बड़ी प्रेरणा है।

मैं जानता हूं कि लाल किले की प्राचीर पर समय की भी एक सीमा है। 130 करोड़ देशवासी उनके सपने भी हैं, 130 करोड़ देशवासियों की अपनी चुनौतियां भी है। हर सपने का, हर चुनौती का अपना महत्‍व भी है। कोई अधिक महत्‍वपूर्ण है कोई कम महत्‍पूर्ण है ऐसा नहीं है। लेकिन बारिश का मौसम है, लंबा बोलते-बोलते speech पूरे होने की संभावना नहीं है और इसलिए हर issue का अपना महत्व होने के बावजूद जितनी चीजें आज कह पाया हूं और जो नहीं कह पाया हूं वो भी महत्‍वपूर्ण हैं। उन बातों को लेकर हम आगे बढ़ें, देश को हमें आगे बढ़ाना है।

आजादी के 75 साल, गांधी के 150 साल और भारत के संविधान के 70 साल हो गए हैं। बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडकर के सपने और यह वर्ष महत्‍वपूर्ण है, गुरू नानक देव जी का 550वां पर्व भी है। आइये, बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडकर, गुरू नानक देव जी की शिक्षा को ले करके हम आगे बढ़ें और एक उत्‍तम समाज का निर्माण, उत्‍तम देश का निर्माण, विश्‍व की आशाओं-अपेक्षाओं के अनुरूप भारत का निर्माण हमें करना है।

मेरे प्‍यारे भाइयो-बहनो हम जानते हैं कि हमारे लक्ष्‍य हिमालय जितने ही ऊंचे हैं, हमारे सपने अनगिनत असंख्‍य तारों से भी ज्‍यादा हैं लेकिन हम ये भी जानते हैं कि हमारे हौसलों के उड़ान के आगे आसमान भी कुछ नहीं है।यह संकल्‍प हैं, हमारा सामर्थ्‍य हिन्‍द महासागर जितना अथाह है, हमारी कोशिशें गंगा की धारा जितनी पव‍ित्र हैं, निरंतर हैं और सबसे बड़ी बात हमारे मूल्‍यों के पीछे हजारों साल की पुरानी संस्‍कृति, ऋषियों की मुनियों की तपस्‍या, देशवासियों का त्‍याग, कठोर परिश्रम - यह हमारी प्रेरणा है।

आइये, हम इन्‍हीं विचारों के साथ, इन्‍हीं आदर्शों के साथ, इन्‍हीं संकल्‍पों के साथ सिद्धि प्राप्‍त करने के लक्ष्‍य को ले करके हम चल पड़ें नया भारत निर्माण करने के लिए, अपनी जिम्‍मेदारियों को निभाते हुए, नया आत्‍मविश्‍वास, नया संकल्‍प, नया भारत बनाने की जड़ी-बूटी है। आइये, हम मिल करके देश को आगे बढ़ाएं। इसी एक अपेक्षा के साथ, मैं फिर एक बार देश के लिए जीने वाले, देश के लिए जूझने वाले, देश के लिए मरने वाले, देश के लिए कुछ कर-गुजरने वाले हर किसी को नमन करते हुए मेरे साथ बोलिये –

‘जय हिन्‍द’।

‘जय हिन्‍द’।

भारत माता की जय,

भारत माता की जय,

वन्‍दे मातरम।

वन्‍दे मातरम।

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

The Haryanvi touch

Highlighting one of the lesser known aspects of Smt. Sushma Swaraj Ji, the PM spoke about her Haryanvi accent.

Smt. Sushma Swaraj Ji could even tell the PM what to do

Recalling an incident when he was about to deliver his first address to the United Nations General Assembly, the PM mentioned how Smt. Sushma Swaraj Ji had guided him what to do. He recollected the incident how Smt. Sushma Swaraj Ji had helped him prepare his speech for the United Nations overnight.

                नमस्‍कार.. आज हम सभी भारतीयों के लिए एक विशेष अवसर है। जब हम डॉक्‍टर विक्रम साराभाई की 100वीं जन्‍म जंयती मना रहे हैं, शताब्‍दी मना रहे हैं। ये अवसर एक ऐसे समय पर आया है जब भारत चंद्रमा पर उतरने जा रहा है। अगले महीने जब विक्रम लैंडर चंद्रमा की सतह पर उतरेगा तो ये 130 करोड़ देशवासियों की तरफ से डॉक्‍टर साराभाई को एक विशेष श्रद्धांजलि होगी।  

साथियों, मुझे खुशी है कि भारत सरकार के दो विभाग Space department और दूसरा Nuclear Energy Department  ये दोनों मिलकर के इस जन्‍मशती का आयोजन कर रहे हैं। मैं इसके लिए दोनों विभागों को बधाई देता हूं। इस साल जनवरी में ही मुझे अहमदाबाद में उनकी प्रतिमा का अनावरण करने का अवसर मिला था।

साथियों, अहमदाबाद जन्‍मभूमि के साथ-साथ उनकी कर्मभूमि भी रहा है। अहमदाबाद में Physical Research Laboratory, Space Application Centre, Textile Industry Research Association, Indian Institute of Management उस कालखंड में  जो कुछ भी निर्माण हुआ, उसमें उनकी भी भूमिका रही। 

साथियों, डॉक्‍टर साराभाई को वैज्ञानिक समुदाय भलीभांति जानता है। ये भी आवश्‍यक है कि आज की पीढ़ी के लिए उनकी प्रेरणादायी जीवन के बारे में जानना बहुत उपयोगी होगी। डॉक्‍टर विक्रम साराभाई को बचपन में ही विज्ञान की बारीकियां और मशीन की दुनिया ने आकर्षित किया। ठीक उसी प्रकार हमारे आस-पास अनेक ऐसी प्रतिभाएं हैं जो उनसे और ऐसे महापुरुषों से सीख सकती हैं। डॉक्‍टर सी.वी. रमन के मार्गदर्शन में बचपन में ही विज्ञान के प्रति डॉक्‍टर साराभाई का आकर्षण बढ़ा है और यही आकर्षण भारत के वैज्ञानिक भविष्‍य का मिशन बन गया। उसी तरह आज की पीढ़ी को भी अपने लक्ष्‍य तय करने में अनेक महापुरुषों से प्रेरणा मिल सकती है। 

साथियों, डॉक्‍टर साराभाई पूरी तरह से आश्‍वस्‍त थे कि भारत के विकास का रास्‍ता विज्ञान और टेक्‍नोलॉजी के जरिए ही निर्मित होगा। वे कहते थे कि अगर देश और दुनिया में हमें अपनी सार्थक भूमिका निभानी है तो जनता की, समाज की हर समस्‍या के समाधान के लिए आधुनिक टेक्‍नोलॉजी के उपयोग में हम किसी से पीछे न रहें। उनके इसी विजन ने आज भारत को science और technology के क्षेत्र में बड़ी ताकत बनाने में अहम भूमिका निभाई है। Space Technology हो या फिर Nuclear Technology  आज इन दोनों का उपयोग हम भारत के सामान्‍य जन की सुविधा और सुरक्षा के लिए कर पा रहे हैं।    

साथियों, Science और Technology को जन सरोकार से उन्‍होंने कैसे जोड़ा इसका बेहतरीन उदाहरण है site program,  SITE,  सैटेलाइट और टेलीविजन को शिक्षा से जोड़ने का पहला सफल प्रयास डॉक्‍टर साराभाई ने ही किया। इसी से प्रेरित होकर गुजरात के खेड़ा से communication project चला और देखते ही देखते भारत में सैटेलाइट से शिक्षा का माध्‍यम विकसित होता चला गया।   

साथियों, आज हर भारतवासी अपनी वैज्ञानिक क्षमताओं पर गर्व करता है। लेकिन कल्‍पना कीजिए कि डॉक्‍टर होमी भाभा के निधन से देश के विज्ञान जगत में जो खालीपन आ गया था उसको भरना कितना मुश्किल रहा होगा। डॉक्‍टर साराभाई ने उस void को भरा ही अपनी कुशलता से, अपनी नेतृत्‍व क्षमता से। हमारे परमाणु और अंतरिक्ष कार्यक्रमों को नया आयाम दिया है। यही कारण है कि जिस रॉकेट को उन्‍होंने थुंबा से छोड़ा था वो आज अलग-अलग स्‍वरूप लेता हुआ हमें चांद और मंगल तक पहुंचा रहा है। आज स्‍पेस में भारत की हर उपलब्धि को पूरी दुनिया चकित होकर के देख रही है, प्रशंसा से भरी हुई है।     

साथियों, डॉक्‍टर साराभाई एक महान वैज्ञानिक तो थे ही, एक बेहतरीन इंसान और अंतर्मन से वे शिक्षक भी थे। वे कितने भी व्‍यस्‍त रहें लेकिन विद्यार्थियों के लिए हमेशा समय निकालते थे। उनका ये दृढ़ विश्‍वास था कि नए भारत का निर्माण कुशल और सक्षम वैज्ञानिकों की नई पीढ़ी ही करेगी। आज जब आप सभी को, देश के हर वैज्ञानिक को देश देखता है तो महसूस होता है कि डॉक्‍टर विक्रम साराभाई कितने दूरदर्शी थे। वो विज्ञान के लिए समर्पित सिपाही तो थे ही, उन्‍होंने भारतीय संस्‍कृति और संस्‍कृ‍त भाषा को भी प्रोत्‍साहित किया। भारतीय दर्शन की उन्‍हें गहरी समझ थी। वे कहते थे कि कर्मण्‍येवाधिकारस्‍ते का सिद्धांत, objectivity और detachment का आधार है जो वैज्ञानिकों के लिए बहुत जरूरी है।     

साथियों, डॉक्‍टर साराभाई के जीवन की सीख बिल्‍कुल स्‍पष्‍ट है, हमारे पास जो क्षमता है, कौशल है वो तब तक अधूरा है जब तक उससे समाज का, देश का हित न हो। यही कारण है कि विज्ञान और टेक्‍नोलॉजी के हर विद्यार्थी से मेरी अपेक्षा रहती है कि वो समाज की समस्‍याओं को समझे और उसके समाधान के लिए Innovation करे, आविष्‍कार करे। डॉक्‍टर साराभाई एक बहुत बड़ी विरासत छोड़कर के गए हैं, ये हम सभी का दायित्‍व है कि इस विरासत को जन-जन तक पहुंचाए ताकि युवा पीढ़ी प्रेरित हो सके और अपने ज्ञान से, कर्म से, देश का ही नहीं बल्कि पूरी मानवता का भविष्‍य संवार सके। 

मैं आज देशभर के सभी लोगों से खासकर विद्यार्थियों से, स्‍कूल-कॉलेज में पढ़ने वाले सभी छात्र-छात्राओं से आग्रह करता हूं कि इसरो के Online Space Quiz, उसमें जरूर हिस्‍सा लें। 10 अगस्‍त से ये Quiz शुरू हो चुकी है और 20 अगस्‍त तक चलेगी। इस competition में प्रत्‍येक राज्‍य से दो विजेताओं को 7 सितंबर को हरिकोटा आमंत्रित किया जाएगा। वो उस ऐतिहासिक पल के साक्षी बनेगें जब चंद्रयान-2, चंद्रमा पर उतरेगा। 

इस अवसर पर डॉक्‍टर विक्रम साराभाई की स्‍मृति में सिक्‍कों, फोटो एलबम और अंतरिक्ष में भारत की उपलब्धियों पर संग्रहणीय पुस्‍तक के प्रकाशन के लिए भी मैं अंतरिक्ष और परमाणु ऊर्जा विभाग को बधाई देता हूं। 

एक बार फिर डॉक्‍टर विक्रम साराभाई को मैं आदरपूर्वक श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित करता हूं। 

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद आप सबका।

                My fellow countrymen,

As a country and as a family, you and us, together we took a historic decision. A system which denied due rights to our brothers and sisters of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh; a system which was huge hurdle in their development has now been eradicated. A dream which Sardar Vallabh bhai Patel had, a dream which Babasaheb Ambedkar had, the dream shared by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Atalji and crores of citizens, has now been fulfilled.

A new age has begun in Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh. Now the rights and accountabilities of all the citizens of the country are similar. I congratulate the people Jammu-Kashmir, Ladakh and each and every citizen of the country. 

Friends, 

Sometimes certain things of the social life get so entangled with time that they are considered to be permanent. A sentiment of complacency develops and it is thought that nothing is ever going to change. A similar sentiment prevailed for Article 370. Because of this there was no debate or talk about the damage done to our brothers and sisters, our children in Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh. Astonishingly, nobody was able to list the benefits that Article 370 delivered to the people of Jammu-Kashmir. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Article 370 and 35A have given nothing but secessionism, terrorism, nepotism and widespread corruption on a large scale to Jammu-Kashmir. Both these articles were used as a weapon by Pakistan to flare up the emotions of some people. Due to this about 42,000 people lost their lives in the last three decades. The development in Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh could not be done on levels which the region deserved. After the removal of this flaw from the system, the people of Jammu-Kashmir will not only have a better present but also a bright future ahead. 

Friends, 

Whichever government comes to power, it works for the betterment of the country by enacting laws in the Parliament. No matter which party or coalition is in power, this work never stops. There is a lot of debate both inside and outside the Parliament when laws are enacted and made, a lot of debate and brainstorming occurs and serious arguments are put up over its importance and effect. The laws that are enacted after undergoing this process are beneficial for the people of the nation. However, it’s unfathomable that so many laws are enacted in the Parliament but are not implemented in a particular region of the country. Even previous governments who were hailed after enacting a law couldn’t claim that the same law would be implemented in the Jammu & Kashmir region.

More than 1.5 crore people of Jammu & Kashmir were deprived of the benefits of laws that were enacted for the benefit of the people of India. Imagine children in rest of the country have a right to education while children in Jammu & Kashmir were deprived of this right. The daughters of Jammu & Kashmir were deprived of the right that our daughters had in rest of the states. In all the other states, Safai Karamchari Act was enacted for hygiene workers but the workers of Jammu & Kashmir were deprived of this. In other states, strict laws were enacted to stop atrocities on Dalits but no such laws could be implemented in Jammu & Kashmir. To protect the rights of blue-collar workforce, Minimum Wages Act was enacted and implemented in all the other states while such a law is only found on papers in the state of Jammu & Kashmir. In all other states, (our) brothers and sisters from Scheduled Tribes got reservation while contesting elections, but such a thing is unheard of in the state of Jammu & Kashmir.

Friends, I am fully confident that, following abrogation of Article 370 and 35-A, Jammu and Kashmir would soon come out of its negative effects.

Brothers and sisters, in the new system, the priority of the central government would be to keep state government employees and Jammu and Kashmir police personnel at par with the state government employees and police personnel of other states in terms of facilities.  In Union Territories, the government provides many such financial facilities like LTC, House Rent Allowance, Education Allowance for children, Health Schemes etc., most of which are not provided to the employees of Jammu and Kashmir government. Such facilities would soon be provided to the employees of Jammu and Kashmir government and state police personnel following a review.

Friends, very soon the process to fill in the vacancies of central and state government will be initiated in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.This would provide adequate employment opportunities to the local youth. Besides, public sector units of the central government and big private sector companies would also be encouraged to provide new employment opportunities. Apart from the above, Army and para military forces would organize rallies to recruit local youths. The government would also expand Prime Minister’s Scholarship Scheme so that more and more students can get its benefit. Jammu and Kashmir also suffers huge revenue loss. The central government will ensure to minimize its impact.

Brothers and sisters, after abrogation of Article 370, the central government has decided to keep the state of Jammu and Kashmir under its administration after putting in a lot of thought process it. It is essential for you to understand the reasons behind the decision. Ever since the state has been under governor’s rule, the administration of Jammu and Kashmir is directly under the central government. As a result the positive effect of Good Governance and Development have been observed on the ground. The schemes which earlier remained only in files, have been implemented on ground. Projects pending from decades have been speeded up. We have tried to bring transparency and a new work culture in the Jammu and Kashmir administration. As a result, be it IIT, IIM, AIIMS, various irrigation projects or power projects or the Anti-Corruption Bureau, we have been able to expedite the work on these projects. Besides, be it the projects of connectivity, roads or new rail lines, modernization of the airport, everything is being accelerated.  

Friends, 

The democracy in our country is very strong; but you will be surprised to know that there have been thousands of brother and sisters living for decades in Jammu and Kashmir who had the right to cast their vote in Lok Sabha polls but were not allowed to cast vote in assembly and local body elections. They are the ones who had come to India following partition in 1947. Should we have allowed the injustice to continue in the same way?

Friends,

I would also like to clarify another important point to my brothers and sisters of Jammu and Kashmir. Your political representative will be elected by you, He will be one of you. The MLAs would be elected just as they used to be elected earlier. The forthcoming cabinet would just be as it used to be earlier. The chief ministers would just be as they were before.

Friends, I am fully confident that, under the new system, we would collectively be able to keep the state of Jammu and Kashmir free from terrorism and secessionism. When our Jammu and Kashmir- the paradise on earth, after achieving new heights of development, attract the whole world, and when there will be greater Ease of Living in the lives of citizens; when they would ceaselessly get their rights, when all the tools of governance would speed up the work in favor of the masses, then I don’t think there would be any need to continue with the system under the union government, yes it would continue in Ladakh though. 

Brothers and sisters,

we all want assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, that a new government is formed, that a new chief minister is elected. I assure the people of Jammu and Kashmir that you would get the opportunity to elect your representative in a fully honest and transparent atmosphere. Just as Panchayat polls were held transparently recently, assembly polls would also be held in Jammu and Kashmir. I would urge the Governor of the state that the setting up of Block Development Council, which has been pending for past two-three decades, be constituted as early as possible.

Friends, 

I have personally experienced that those who got elected in Panchayat polls in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh four-five months back, have been working nicely. Few months back when I visited Srinagar, I had a long meeting with them. When they came to Delhi I interacted with them for long at my home. It is because of these friends in Panchayats that the work has been done promptly at village level in Jammu and Kashmir. Be it the task of electrification in every home or making the state Open Defecation Free, the representatives in Panchayats have played a crucial role. I am fully confident that following abbrogation of Artcle 370, once these Panchayat members get a chance to work in the new system, they would do wonders.

I firmly believe that the people of Jammu and Kashmir would conquer secessionism and move forward with new hope. I firmly believe that the people of Jammu and Kashmir would achieve their objectives with renewed fervor in an ecosystem of Good Governance and Transparency. Friends, Family rule has not given any opportunity of leadership to any young citizen of Jammu and Kashmir in the State.

Now, my these young people will take leadership of the development of Jammu and Kashmir and take it to a new height. I appeal to the youth, sisters and daughters of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to take over command of development of their area in their own hands.

Friends, 

There is every possibility of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh becoming one of the greatest tourist destinations. The kind of environment required for this and the change in administration that is needed, is being taken care of. But for this I need the support of all the countrymen. There was a time when Kashmir was the favourite place for shooting Bollywood films. During that time perhaps there was no film for which shooting was not done in Kashmir. Now, situations in Jammu and Kashmir will normalize. Now not only from India, people from all over the world will come for shooting there. Every Film will bring with it new opportunity of employment for the people of Kashmir. I appeal to the Hindi, Telugu and Tamil Film Industry and people associated with it to definitely think over for investment, shooting of films and establishment of theatres and other resources in Jammu and Kashmir.

I appeal to those who are associated with the technology world, administration or private sector to give priority in their policies and their decisions as to how to disseminate technology in Jammu and Kashmir. When digital communication will be strengthened there and BPO Centres, Common Service Centres will increase in numbers, there will be enhanced opportunity of earning livelihood and the life of our brothers and sisters of Jammu and Kashmir will become easier. 

Friends,

The decision taken by the Govt. will benefit youth of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and those who aspire to progress in the world of sports. New sport academies, new sports stadium, training in scientific environment will help them to show their talent in the world. Friends, whether it is the colour of kesar or flavour of Kahwa or sweetness of apple or juiciness of apricot whether Kashmiri shawls or artefacts; organic products of Ladakh or herbal medicine of Jammu and Kashmir, all these need to be publicised in the whole of world.

I will give you one example. There is a plant in Ladakh, named solo. Experts say that this plant is like a sanjivini for people living in high altitude and for security forces deployed in heavy icy mountains. These plants have great role in maintaining immune system of the body at where oxygen level is low. Just think over, should these extraordinary items be sold or not in the whole world? Which Indian will not like this?

Friends, I have named only one plant. There are ample plants, herbal products spread over Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Those will be identified. If they are sold, it will benefit the people and the farmers of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Therefore, I appeal to the people associated with Industry, Export, Food Processing Sector to come forward to ensure that local products of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh reach whole of the world.

Friends, after becoming a Union territory, the development of people of Ladakh is natural responsibility of the Govt. of India. Central Govt., with the cooperation of local representatives, the Development Council of Ladakh and Kargil, will make available the benefit of all developmental schemes at a faster rate. There is possibility of Ladakh becoming one of the greatest Centers of spiritual tourism, adventure tourism and eco-tourism. Solar Power generation could become a vast centre of Ladakh.

Now, the capability of people of Ladakh will be utilized appropriately and new opportunity of development will come without any discrimination. Now the innovative spirit of youth of Ladakh will get boosted, they will get good institutes for good education, people will get good hospitals, and infrastructure will be modernized with priority. 

Friends,

It is possible in democracy that some people will agree to this decision and some will oppose it. I respect their disagreement and their objections. Whatever is being argued in this connection, Central Govt. is responding to that and it is trying to resolve the same. It is our democratic responsibility.But I urge them to act keeping the national interest as paramount and help the government in giving a new direction to Jammu - Kashmir-Ladakh. Come forward to help the country.

Moving ahead from the fact that who voted in Parliament, who didn’t, who supported the bill, who didn’t, now we all  have to come together to work unitedly in the interest of Jammu - Kashmir-Ladakh. I also want to convey every countryman that the concerns of Jammu – Kashmir and Ladakh are our collective concerns. These are the concerns of 130 crore citizens. We are not indifferent to their happiness or sorrows and sufferings. The riddance from Article 370 is a reality.  But it is also true that whatever odds are being caused now because of these historic steps are being fought by them only.

Our brothers and sisters of that region are patiently replying to those handful people, who want to vitiate the atmosphere there.  We should not forget that it is the patriots of Jammu – Kashmir who are strongly opposing the conspiracies of Pakistan of instigating terrorism and separatism.

Our brothers and sisters, who believe in Indian Constitution, deserve a better life. We are proud of them.Today I assure these friends of Jammu – Kashmir that the situation will gradually return to normal and all their troubles too will reduce. 

Friends, the festival of Eid is around the corner. I extend my greetings to all on Eid. The government is taking all necessary steps so that the people of Jammu – Kashmir don’t face any problem while celebrating Eid. The government is extending all possible help to those friends who live outside Jammu – Kashmir and want to return back to their homes on Eid.

Friends, today on this occasion, I also express my gratitude to our friends in security forces, who are deployed for the security of the people of Jammu – Kashmir. The way all the administrative officials, state employees and Jammu – Kashmir police personnel are handling the situation is really commendable. Your this diligence has boosted my confidence that change can happen.

Brothers and sisters, Jammu – Kashmir is the crown of our country. We are proud that many brave sons and daughters of Jammu – Kashmir have sacrificed and risked their lives for its security. Maulvi Ghulam Din of Poonch district, who had informed Indian Army about Pakistani intruders during 1965 war. He was conferred Ashok Chakra. Col. Sonam Wangchug of Ladakh district, who forced enemies to bite dust during Kargil war, was honoured with Mahavir Chakra. Kirti Chakra was conferred on Rukshana Kausar of Rajauri, who had killed a big terrorist.Martyr Aurangjeb of Poonch, who was assassinated by terrorists last year and whose two brothers are now serving the country after joining the Army. The list of such brave sons and daughters is very long. Several jawans and officials of Jammu – Kashmir Police have also laid their lives while fighting with terrorists.  We have lost thousands of people from other parts of the country as well. They all had a dream of seeing a peaceful, safe and prosperous Jammu – Kashmir. We, together, have to realize their dream. Friends! This decision will help in economic development of the entire country alongwith Jammu - Kashmir and Ladakh. When peace and prosperity prevails in this important part of the globe, the efforts for peace in entire world will be naturally strengthened.  

I call upon my brothers and sisters of Jammu – Kashmir and Ladakh to come together to show the world how much strength, courage and passion we have. Let us come together to build a new India, as well as a new Jammu - Kashmir and Ladakh.

Thank you very much!

Jai Hind!!!

Expressing condolence over her demise, Prime Minister said, “A glorious chapter in Indian politics comes to an end. India grieves the demise of a remarkable leader who devoted her life to public service and bettering lives of the poor. Sushma Swaraj Ji was one of her kind, who was a source of inspiration for crores of people.
Sushma Ji was a prolific orator and outstanding Parliamentarian. She was admired and revered across party lines. She was uncompromising when it came to matters of ideology and interests of the BJP, whose growth she immensely contributed to.
An excellent administrator, Sushma Ji set high standards in every Ministry she handled. She played a key role in bettering India’s ties with various nations. As a Minister we also saw her compassionate side, helping fellow Indians who were in distress in any part of the world.
I can’t forget the manner in which Sushma Ji worked tirelessly as EAM in the last 5 years. Even when her health was not good, she would do everything possible to do justice to her work and remain up to date with matters of her Ministry. The spirit and commitment was unparalleled.
Sushma Ji’s demise is a personal loss. She will be remembered fondly for everything that she’s done for India. My thoughts are with her family, supporters and admirers in this very unfortunate hour. Om Shanti”.
Former External Affairs Minister Ms. Sushma Swaraj passed away last night in New Delhi.

He said, “In Parliament, political parties rose to the occasion, overcame ideological differences and took part in a rich debate that increased the pride of our Parliamentary democracy. For that, I congratulate all MPs, various political parties and their leaders.”

The prime minister in a separate tweet said “People of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh would be proud that MPs overcame differences and discussed the future of these regions as well as ensuring peace, progress and prosperity there. The widespread support can be clearly seen in the final numbers, 125:61 in RS and 370:70 in LS.”

He said, “India’s Vice President and Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, M Venkaiah Naidu Garu as well as Speaker Om Birla Kota Ji conducted proceedings of both Houses in an excellent manner, for which they deserve praise from the entire nation.“

He specially congratulated Home Minister Amit Shah. “Our Home Minister Amit Shah Ji has been continuously working towards ensuring a better life for the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. His commitment and diligence is clearly visible in the passage of these Bills. I would like to specially congratulate Amit Bhai!”

                Shri Rajiv Gauba today took over as the new Cabinet Secretary in the Government of India after the superannuation of Shri P.K. Sinha.   He is an IAS officer of Jharkhand cadre (1982 batch) and has held important assignments like Union Home Secretary, Secretary, Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India and Chief Secretary, Jharkhand. He has also represented India at the International monetary Fund.

Shri Gauba brings to his new assignment rich and wide-ranging experience spanning Security, Governance and Financial verticals in the Central and State Governments as also in international organisations.

He was one of the key implementers of the Centre’s decision to abrogate Article 370 and the reorganization of Jammu & Kashmir, and is widely credited for flawless and smooth implementation of the decision. With an eye for details, he spearheaded the formulation and execution of these initiatives in MHA. Along with a small core team, he gave final shape to constitutional and legal aspects while working out administrative and security arrangements. 

Earlier, during his stint in MHA as Additional Secretary, he prepared a multi- pronged action plan in 2015 to tackle LWE and steered its implementation which has resulted in significantly shrinking the spread of Maoists’ area of influence. 

Besides MHA, Shri Gauba has served in the Central Government in wide ranging areas such as Urban Development, Defence, Environment & Forests, and Department of Electronics and Information Technology.

As Chief Secretary of Jharkhand, Shri Gauba had introduced major governance and economic reforms including lateral entry of professionals, restructuring, downsizing of Ministries, and labour reforms.  Jharkhand leapt from the bottom of the table to 3rd rank in Ease of Doing Business during his tenure. 

Shri Gauba has also served in the International Monetary Fund representing the country for four years on the Board of IMF.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval for the Establishment of an International Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) along with its supporting Secretariat Office in New Delhi. The proposal was approved by the Prime Minister on 13th August, 2019.

The CDRI is proposed to be launched at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, USA on 23rd September 2019. Organized by the UN Secretary General, this event will bring together the largest number of Heads of States to generate commitments for combating the effects of climate change and resulting disasters, and will provide the high-level visibility required for the CDRI.

The approval, inter-alia, is for the following initiatives:


	Establishment of the International ‘C.D.R.I.’ along with its supporting Secretariat office in New Delhi;



	Establishment of the Secretariat of the CDRI as a Society under The Societies Registration Act,1860 in New Delhi as ‘CDRI Society’ or similar name as per availability. The memorandum of association and by-laws of the ‘CDRI Society’ will be prepared and finalized by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in due course;
	In-principle approval for Government of India support of Rs. 480 crore (approx. USD 70 million) to CDRI for a corpus required to fund technical assistance and research projects on an on-going basis, setting up the Secretariat office and covering recurring expenditures over a period of 5 years from 2019-20 to 2023-24; and



	The endorsed version of the Charter document that will act as the founding document of the CDRI. The charter will be finalized after taking inputs from potential member countries by the NDMA in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs.


Major Impact:

The CDRI will serve as a platform where knowledge is generated and exchanged on different aspects of disaster and climate resilience of infrastructure. It will bring together technical expertise from a multitude of stakeholders. In doing so, it will create a mechanism to assist countries to upgrade their capacities and practices, with regard to infrastructure development in accordance with their risk context and economic needs.

This initiative will benefit all sections of society. Economically weaker sections of society, women and children, are the most vulnerable to the impacts of disasters and hence, will be benefitted from the improvement of knowledge and practice in creating disaster resilient infrastructure. It will also benefit all areas with high disaster risk. In India, the north-eastern and Himalayan regions are prone to earthquakes, coastal areas to cyclones and tsunamis and central peninsular region to droughts.

Innovation:

          There are many initiatives on different aspects of disaster risk reduction and many initiatives on infrastructure development in different in a range of countries with different disaster risk and development contexts.

          A global coalition for disaster resilient infrastructure would address concerns that are common to developing and developed countries, small and large economies, countries at early and advanced stages of infrastructure development, and countries that have moderate or high disaster risk. Few concrete initiatives work at the intersection of Sendai Framework, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Climate Change Adaptation with a focus on infrastructure. Focus on disaster resilient infrastructure would simultaneously address the loss reduction targets under the Sendai Framework, address a number of SDGs and also contribute to climate change adaptation. Hence, there is a clear niche for a Global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.

          Publication of natural hazard risk information about the different regions in India will allow the public to understand the risk in their regions and demand for risk mitigation and preparedness measures from their local and State Governments.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for Review of Foreign Direct Investment on various sectors.

Major Impact and Benefits from FDI Policy Reform


	The changes in FDI policy will result in making India a more attractive FDI destination, leading to benefits of increased investments, employment and growth.
	In the coal sector, for sale of coal, 100% FDI under automatic route for coal mining,activities including associated processing infrastructure will attract international players to create an efficient and competitive coal market.
	Further, manufacturing through contract contributes equally to the objective of Make in India. FDI now being permitted under automatic route in contract manufacturing will be a big boost to Manufacturing sector in India.
	Easing local sourcing norms for FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT) was announced in Union Budget Speech of Finance Minister. This will lead to greater flexibility and ease of operations for SBRT entities, besides creating a level playing field for companies with higher exports in a base year. In addition, permitting online sales prior to opening of brick and mortar stores brings policy in sync with current market practices. Online sales will also lead to creation of jobs in logistics, digital payments, customer care, training and product skilling.
	The above amendments to the FDI Policy are meant to liberalize and simplify the FDI policy to provide ease of doing business in the country, leading to larger FDI inflows and thereby contributing to growth of investment, income and employment.


Background

FDI is a major driver of economic growth and a source of non-debt finance for the economic development of the country. Government has put in place an investor friendly policy on FDI, under which FDI up to 100% is permitted on the automatic route in most sectors/ activities. FDI policy provisions have been progressively liberalized across various sectors in recent years to make India an attractive investment destination. Some of the sectors include Defence, Construction Development, Trading, Pharmaceuticals, Power Exchanges, Insurance, Pension, Other Financial Services, Asset reconstruction Companies, Broadcasting and Civil Aviation.

These reforms have contributed to India attracting record FDI inflows in the last 5 years. Total FDI into India from 2014-15 to 2018-19 has been US $ 286 billion as compared to US $ 189 billion in the 5-year period prior to that (2009-10 to 2013-14). In fact, total FDI in 2018-19 i.e. US $ 64.37 billion (provisional figure) is the highest ever FDI received for any financial year.

 

Global FDI inflows have been facing headwinds for the last few years. As per UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2019, global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows slid by 13% in 2018, to US $1.3 trillion from US $1.5 trillion the previous year - the third consecutive annual decline. Despite the dim global picture, India continues to remain a preferred and attractive destination for global FDI flows. However, it is felt that the country has the potential to attract far more foreign investment which can be achieved inter-alia by further liberalizing and simplifying the FDI policy regime.

In Union Budget 2019-20, Finance Minister proposed to further consolidate the gains under FDI in order to make India a more attractive FDI destination. Accordingly, the Government has decided to introduce a number of amendments in the FDI Policy. Details of these changes are given in the following paragraphs.

Coal Mining

As per the present FDI policy, 100% FDI under automatic route is allowed for coal & lignite mining for captive consumption by power projects, iron & steel and cement units and other eligible activities permitted under and subject to applicable laws and regulations. Further, 100% FDI under automatic route is also permitted for setting up coal processing plants like washeries subject to the condition that the company shall not do coal mining and shall not sell washed coal or sized coal from its coal processing plants in the open market and shall supply the washed or sized coal to those parties who are supplying raw coal to coal processing plants for washing or sizing.

It has been decided to permit 100% FDI under automatic route for sale of coal, for coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure subject to provisions of Coal Mines (special provisions) Act, 2015 and the Mines and Minerals (development and regulation) Act, 1957 as amended from time to time, and other relevant acts on the subject. ""Associated Processing Infrastructure"" would include coal washery, crushing, coal handling, and separation (magnetic and non-magnetic)

Contract Manufacturing


	The extant FDI policy provides for 100% FDI under automatic route in manufacturing sector. There is no specific provision for Contract Manufacturing in the Policy. In order to provide clarity on contract manufacturing, it has been decided to allow 100% FDI under automatic route in contract manufacturing in India as well.  



	Subject to the provisions of the FDI policy, foreign investment in 'manufacturing' sector is under automatic route. Manufacturing activities may be conducted either by the investee entity or through contract manufacturing in India under a legally tenable contract, whether on Principal to Principal or Principal to Agent basis.


Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT)


	The extant FDI Policy provides that 30% of value of goods has to be procured from India if SBRT entity has FDI more than 51%. Further, as regards local sourcing requirement, the same can be met as an average during the first 5 years, and thereafter annually towards its India operations. With a view to provide greater flexibility and ease of operations to SBRT entities, it has been decided that all procurements made from India by the SBRT entity for that single brand shall be counted towards local sourcing, irrespective of whether the goods procured are sold in India or exported. Further, the current cap of considering exports for 5 years only is proposed to be removed, to give an impetus to exports.
	The extant Policy provides that as regards local sourcing requirement, incremental sourcing for global operations by the non-resident entities undertaking single brand retail trading, either directly or through their group companies, will also be counted towards local sourcing requirement for the first 5 years. However, prevalent business models involve not only sourcing from India for global operations by the entity or its group companies, but also through an unrelated third Party, done at the behest of the entity undertaking single brand retail trading or its group companies. In order to cover such business practices, it has been decided that 'sourcing of goods from India for global operations' can be done directly by the entity undertaking SBRT or its group companies (resident or non-resident}, or indirectly by them through a third party under a legally tenable agreement.
	The extant policy provides that only that part of the global sourcing shall be counted towards local sourcing requirement which is over and above the previous year's value. Such requirement of year-on-year incremental increase in exports induces aberrations in the system as companies with lower exports in a base year or any of ' the subsequent years can meet the current requirements, while a company with consistently high exports gets unduly discriminated against. It has been now decided that entire sourcing from India for global operations shall be considered towards local sourcing requirement. (And no incremental value)
	The present policy requires that SBRT entities have to operate through brick and mortar stores before starting retail trading of that brand through e-commerce. This creates an artificial restriction and is out of sync with current market practices. It has therefore been decided that retail trading through online trade can also be undertaken prior to opening of brick and mortar stores, subject to the condition that the entity opens brick and mortar stores within 2 years from date of start of online retail. Online sales will lead to creation of jobs in logistics, digital payments, customer care, training and product skilling.


Digital Media

The extant FDI policy provides for 49% FDI under approval route in Up-linking of 'News &Current Affairs' TV Channels. It has been decided to permit 26% FDI under government route for uploading/ streaming of News & Current Affairs through Digital Media, on the lines of print media.

She was also conferred Honorary Doctorate by the Agriculture University, Kanpur. In 1973, she started practice as an advocate in the Supreme Court of India.

Smt. Sushma Swaraj entered public life at a young age and won election to the Haryana Legislative Assembly at the age of 25 years in 1977 and became Cabinet Minister for Labour and Employment in the State Government of Haryana. She was again elected as a member of Haryana Legislative Assembly and became the Cabinet Minister for Education, Food and Civil Supplies during the period 1987 to 1990.

In 1990, she was elected to the Rajya Sabha and in 1996, as a member of the 11th Lok Sabha when she became the Union Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting.

In October, 1998, she became the first woman Chief Minister of Delhi. Thereafter, in April, 2000, she was again elected to the Rajya Sabha and became the Minister for Information and Broadcasting from September, 2000 to January 2003 and then the Minister for Health and Family Welfare and Parliamentary Affairs from January 2003 to May 2004.

Smt. Sushma Swaraj will always be remembered for her exceptional oratorial skills and a compassionate approach. She was an able administrator and an affable person with humane touch who won the hearts of all by helping Indians in distress abroad. For these qualities, she was declared as ""India's best loved politician"" by the US daily 'Wall Street Journal' in 2017.

The Cabinet places on record its appreciation of Smt. Sushma Swaraj's services to the Nation in different capacities. The Cabinet also extends its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family on behalf of the Government and the entire nation.”

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for providing a lump sum export subsidy @ Rs. 10,448 per Metric Tonne (MT) to sugar mills for the sugar season 2019-20.  The total estimated expenditure of about Rs.6,268 crore will be incurred for this purpose.

The lump sum export subsidy will be provided for expenses on marketing costs including handling, upgrading and other processing costs, costs of international and internal transport and freight charges on export of up to 60 Lakh Metric Tonne (LMT) of sugar limited to Maximum Admissible Export Quantity (MAEQ) allocated to sugar mills for the sugar season 2019-20. 

The subsidy would be directly credited into farmers’ account on behalf of mills against cane price dues and subsequent balance, if any, would be credited to mill’s account.  [[The subsidy shall be in conformity with the provisions of Article 9.1 (d) & (e) of Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and thus WTO compatible.

In wake of surplus sugar production during sugar season 2017-18(October – September) and sugar season 2018-19, notwithstanding various measures taken by the Government, the ensuing sugar season 2019-20 is expected to commence with an opening stock of about 142 LMT and season end stock are expected to be about 162 LMT.

Background:  

            The surplus stock of 162 LMT of sugar would create downward pressure throughout the season on sugar prices affecting liquidity of the sugar mills thereby leading to accumulation of cane price arrears of farmers.

To deal with this situation, the Government has recently created buffer stock of 40 LMT of sugar for one year from 1st August, 2019. However, even after taking into account this buffer stocking of 40 LMT till 31stJuly, 2020 and likely diversion of sugar by way of production of ethanol from B-heavy molasses/cane juice during SS 2019-20 and requirement of  normativestock for two months, there shall be about 60 LMT of excess sugar stock that will need evacuation through export.

New medical colleges would be set up in under-served areas having no medical college; with at least 200 bedded District Hospital. Preference will be given to Aspirational Districts and District Hospital having 300 beds.

The scheme on establishment of new medical colleges (58+24+75) would lead to addition of at least 15,700 MBBS seats in the country.

Continuing   the   focus  on  creation   of  health care  infrastructure,  the Government  earlier  approved  to  establish  58  new Medical  Colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals under Phase-I and 24 under Phase-II.  Of this, 39 medical colleges under Phase-I, have already started functioning, while the remaining 19 would be made functional by 2020-21. Under Phase-II, 18 new medical colleges have been approved.

Background:

Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah, Sarve Santu Niramayah (सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनःसर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः) is the guiding principle of the Government. Government has announced as a part of 'AyushmanBharat' two path breaking initiatives that address health holistically, impacting primary, secondary andtertiary care system as well as prevention and health promotion.

                The Government has approved Ministry of Railways plan to construct the New Line between Vaibhavwadi – Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) (108 km) with an estimated cost of Rs. 3,439 crore. The project will be completed by 2023-24 and will be executed by Construction Organization of Central Railway. 

The proposed alignment from Vaibhavwadi to Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) passes through the districts of Kolhapur, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg of Maharashtra state. The proposed alignment would link Kolhapur railway station (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) on the existing Pune-Kolhapur section of Central Railway with Vaibhavwadi Railway Station on the existing Roha-Madgaon section of Konkan Railway. The proposed link would reduce the distances for thermal coal transportation for a number of power plants in Maharashtra and Karnataka. 

The addition of Vaibhavwadi-Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) is expected to directly benefit the districts of Belgaum, Ballari, Bijapur, Gulbarga, Latur,  & Solapur and create a shorter evacuation route to western ports as there is a lack of Rail connectivity between Central and Konkan regions leads to longer supply routes for power plants in the Northern Karnataka and Southern Maharashtra region which affects supply coming from ports like Mumbai, JNPT, Krishnapatnam and New Mangalore due to longer rail route of Ratnagiri-Panvel-Pune route. 

Kolhapur cluster, as part of western Maharashtra, has a vibrant industrial belt which consists of manufacturing based industries, auto parts and ancillary, sugar manufacturing, textiles, edible oil processing factories etc. With the increased industrial development in and nearby area of west coast, imports are going to increase in future. Also, with the proposal of world class infrastructure coming up at Jaigad and Vijaydurg on the west coast, the district would be benefitting immensely. Thus, with the advent of the Vaibhavwadi-Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) line and the upcoming Vijaydurg port, Gulbarga, Adilabad and the nearby industrial clusters will be able to exploit the closeness to west coast. 

There will also be reduction in distance and time taken for freight trains running on the existing Vaibhavwadi-Roha-Pune route and Miraj-Pune-Panvel-Pen route if the same is routed via the Vaibhavwadi–Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) project line. This project will also generate employment direct during construction for about 26 lakh mandays.

                The Government has given its approval for increasing the speed of the Delhi-Mumbai route (including Kanpur-Lucknow) to 160 Kmph’ at a total cost of Rs. 6,806 cr by 2022-23. This will ensure improved speed, service, safety and create capacity. As part of Mission Raftaar, Indian Railways is working in mission mode to improve the average speed of trains across the network. Increasing the speed of the Delhi-Mumbai Section to 160 Kmph will ensure upto 60% increase in average speed of passenger trains and doubling of average speed of freight traffic.

The 1,483 Kms long Delhi-Mumbai Route passes through 7 states, namely Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The travel time between New Delhi and Mumbai will be reduced by 3.5 hours, now making it a fully overnight journey. Increasing the maximum speed of the Delhi-Mumbai route will also give further impetus to semi-high speed trains. It will allow such trains to unlock their full potential and travel at a speed of 160 Kmph, to ensure passengers have best in class speed and service. In addition, it has been found that the safer LHB coaches too can be made fit for this speed.

The scope of the project includes fencing, Automatic Train Protection System (ETCS 2/TPWS), Mobile Train Radio Communication, and automated and mechanised diagnostic systems, which will considerably enhance safety and reliability. Besides the above main inputs, the policy also requires removal of all level crossings which are being eliminated otherwise under a separate plan head. 

The entire project has been structured on a new approach of route wise single composite work with single agency execution, and complete funding through  Extra Budgetary Resources - Institutional Finance (ERB-IF). With improved funding, better coordination, economies of scale, and induction of state of the art technology, the project will be completed in 4 years from the date of approval.  Furthermore, work along the line will be planned with minimum disruption of traffic, ensuring passengers and businesses are least affected during the construction phase.

The project will help boost employment during the construction phase with more than 3.6 crore mandays to be generated directly. It will also help kick start an economic multiplier that will give a boost to growth in all states. The project will also lead to an increase in throughput on the route by 30-35%, paving the way for PPP models in the future. 

As a part of Mission Raftaar, Government has also granted similar approval for the Delhi-Howrah route, which together with the Delhi-Mumbai route account for 29% of passenger traffic and 20% of freight traffic. Railways is also working to cover the complete Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals of Indian Railways, which consist of 16% of the total Indian Railways Network, but account for 52% of total passenger traffic and 58% of total freight traffic.

The treatment of Cancer is managed by Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), a fully autonomous aided institution of DAE, provides comprehensive treatment to cancer patients.  Medical devices for Tele-ECG, Bhabhatron- A Radiation tele-therapy machine, screening of TB and Cancer are on display.

Agriculture: DAE has developed 44 high yielding seed varieties by inducing mutationto suitlocal weather conditionsacross the country. DAEhas also developed technologies of fertilizer production frombio-sludge and encourages organic farming. The disease resistant, low maturity period and high yielding crops have been well accepted by the farmers. Rural technologies are also being made available to rural youth through ‘AKRUTI’ programme.

Water: DAE has developed technologies for clean waterto fulfill departmental requirements and as spin-off developed many techniques which finds applications in ultra-filtration membrane, RO membrane, multistage flash evaporation and water hydrology based on radiotracers. Low cost water filters for removal of all contamination from drinking water have been displayed.

Environment: DAE technologies are findinga lot of applications for Swatch Bharat Mission where bio-methanization& Urban Sludge Hygienization technologies are being deployed across the country.  “Nisargruna” plant is a bio- Methanization plant for digesting kitchen food waste and green vegetable wastes from agriculture markets to Methane gas which can be used for cooking/generating electricity or even for running biogas vehicles.  This plant can digest animal waste from slaughter house also.

                The Minister for Tourism and Culture, Shri Prahlad Singh Patel and senior officials from both the Ministries today called on the 15th Finance Commission headed by  Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh to put forth the financial projections of the Ministries on various schemes and projects and also suggest measures for incentivizing States by the Finance Commission in its rewards, for the promotion of tourism and culture.

The Chairman, Shri N. K. Singh observed that the Tourism and Culture sectors are very important for the Finance Commission as they were engines of employment generation, income growth, integral part of integration of the nation and for building international relations.  He says that the Commission was aware of the typical problems of the sectors most of which were legacy issues.  The Chairman was of the view that major changes were required in the ASI Act 1958,  which was dated and not suited for current times.  He suggested that private sector participation should be encouraged for the up-keep of protected monuments and should be enacted to aggressively market the monuments amongst international and domestic tourists.  The meeting discussed the Prime Minister’s stress on domestic tourism and Chairman was of the view that sending school students to the different parts of the country should be made mandatory on the part of the school - by making it a part of the school syllabus.  He recalled that he had already raised  this issue with the Union  HRD Minister,

Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal. The  meeting discussed the problems facing the hotel industry and the lack of connectivity infrastructure which was hampering the growth of tourism across the country.

The Commission was informed by the Tourism Ministry that –


	Niche Products have been identified by the Ministry of Tourism for development and promotion: i. Cruise ii. Adventure iii. Medical (also called medical travel, health tourism or global healthcare) iv. Wellness (Indian system of medicine covered by Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) v. Golf vi. Polo vii. Meetings Incentives Conferences & Exhibitions (MICE) viii. Eco-tourism ix. Film Tourism x. Sustainable Tourism
	Human Resource Management and Broad-basing of the Hospitality Education followed by Capacity Building for Service Providers leading to easy access to tourism destinations in terms of international transport and facilities are the major areas of concern for the Ministry.
	MoT to work towards augmenting tourism infrastructure, easing of visa regime, assurance of quality standards in services of tourism service providers, projecting the country as a 365 days’ tourist destination, promoting tourism in a sustainable manner
	MoT to accord priority for holistic development of tourism destinations into world class destination using a cluster approach including development of infrastructure, amenities, interpretation centres and skill development by achieving synergy and convergence with other Central Ministries, State Governments and Industry Stakeholders
	Major schemes of the Ministry of Tourism for achieving its objectives:



	Integrated Development of Tourist Circuits around Specific Themes – Swadesh Darshan
	National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual, Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)
	Assistance to Central Agencies for Tourism Infrastructure Development
	Domestic Promotion & Publicity including Hospitality (DPPH)
	Overseas Promotion & Publicity Including Marketing Development Assistance (MDA).
	 Assistance to IHMs/FCIs etc.,
	Capacity Building for Service Providers (CBSP).



	The Ministry of Tourismobserved that State Governments need to be incentivised for contributing to infrastructure development of Tourism destinations by providing land, taking up development of lesser known tourism destinations, provision of wayside amenities and capacity building of hospitality industry.   
	The Ministry has suggested that the performance of the States in tourism sector can be looked into from Foreign Exchange Earnings and Foreign Tourist Visits perspective. However, Foreign Exchange Earnings are compiled by RBI at National Level and hence, it is not possible to get segregated figures for States and the same may therefore, not be suitable for the purpose. 
	Ministry of Tourism has a mechanism to capture the Foreign Tourist Visits to different States which can be used to assess the performance of States in the tourism sector. The claims of the States regarding Foreign Tourist Visits could be crosschecked by undertaking sample surveys for providing performance based incentives to States. 
	Further, the Ministry of Tourism has requested that the performance of States could be assessed through a broader framework beyond export effort by using key parameters such as:



	State expenditure on Tourism
	Tourists visits
	Presence of classified Hotel Rooms
	Effectiveness of marketing campaign
	Ease of Doing Business
	Classified hotel rooms
	Policy guidelines and incentives 
	Tourist Feedback



	The projection of expenditure by the Ministry of Tourism for the year 2020-25 are as follows:

          The Commission was informed by the Culture Ministry that –

 


	A Strategic Shift was envisaged in the culture sector. The programmesmust be integrated into strategies for sustainable development at every level and take into account the needs and aspirations of the community where cultural assets are found. Sustainable heritage conservation depends upon the commitment and involvement of local communities. Conservation policies, to be successful, need to promote local community stewardship of the heritage as well as provide socio-economic benefits for local communities. Therefore, a direct link must be made between safeguarding the heritage and socio-economic development. This calls for the deliberate recasting of heritage conservation as a development activity that brings economic opportunities, creates jobs, and generates income based on traditional technologies and knowhow.
	While ongoing professional and institutional efforts at heritage conservation would be strengthened, participatory approach would be used to catalyse engagement of local community and various interest groups.
	The programme assistance should be provided in the form of practical, technical, and small “start-up” grants to the local communities and NGOs. At least some p[art of the annual plan outlay for culture should be used for these “local” grants.


 

The Ministry of Culture was of the view that:

 


	The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) needs to be strengthened for proper conservation, preservation and maintenance of the build heritage of the country. For this, it would be necessary to prepare a comprehensive coordinated plan for conservation and development of monuments and archaeological sites by the Central and State governments and academic and research institutions. UNESCO Category-2 Regional Centreswould be established.
	Efforts would be stepped up for conservation of unprotected heritage buildings, monuments, archaeological sites, and historic buildings. Fellowships for visiting scholars would be instituted. Cultural Heritage Management Council would be created. And, finally, mapping of cultural heritage resources would be taken up. Schools would be engaged in mapping of local history, ecology and cultural heritage of the area where they are located.
	A large number of Science museums in partnership with the Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of HRD also be established. These could have three parts-pedagogy centre for school/college teachers, science activity centre for students, and science Exploratorium for general public.



	A mechanism should be established to enable ASI to provide financial assistance to projects proposed by the scientific organisations of State Governments, departments of anthropology in universities, NGOs involved in anthropological studies and similar bodies. Further, assistance to State Governments, institutions and organisationsshould also be provided for documentation and dissemination of research results in the field of anthropology.
	It will also develop its own repertoire and be a vibrant cultural hub. This would require about 15-20 acre land in Central Delhi. 
	Similar centres may also be set-up in Kolkata, Chennai and other major cities in due course. In Kolkata, the area encompassing RabindraSadan Cultural Complex and Central Cultural Institute has a potential to be developed into such a Centre. New and innovative institutional arrangements and partnerships may be needed to create and manage such integrated complexes.
	India should explore the possibility of having a permanent presence at the prestigious Venice Biennale of Art. The space could be used not only for the Art Biennale but also for the equally prestigious Venice Biennale of Architecture and in the lean months for any other cultural activities.


The Ministry projected that :


	Central Government needs to partner with the State Governments in making the State Academies play an important role in preserving and promoting performing, visual and literary arts of each state.
	In order to leverage professional expertise and capacity from outside in specific disciplines, Government could enter into partnership with selected universities, institutions of national importance, research institutions and cultural organisations to undertake a mutually agreed programme and function as Centre of Excellence in the specified fields. While autonomy of these organisationswill be respected, deliverables will be closely monitored.
	Several steps like electronic payments, online applications and minutes of expert committees available online have been introduced to bring about transparency.
	Capacity-building and training of personnel to work in various Cultural Organisations is a critical requirement. Presently, some training is being imparted, but in a limited and distributed manner with various institutes under the aegis of the Government. Coordination and expansion of training research should be undertaken through an apex institutional mechanism or a Central Cultural University for the purpose.


Summing up the meeting, the Chairman asked the two Ministries to give all necessary details to the Finance Commission which would help it make important recommendations on:-


	Incentivising States by giving sector specific grants for Tourism & Culture.
	Award States for meeting specific requests for Culture and Tourism.
	Key factors of a new ASI Act – which would bring into focus the by recommendations for highlighting India’s cultural heritage.

                Urging every farmer of the country to be a progressive farmer Union Agriculture Minister Shri Narendra Singh Tomar said that farmers should adopt new technologies and advancements in the field and must have frequent engagements with ascientists and local Krishi Vigyan Kendras. Inaugurating the two day ‘Brainstorming Session on Technological Innovations and Strategies for Farmers’ Prosperity in Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh’ in the presence of the Ministers of State Shri Parshottam Rupala and Shri Kailash Choudhary in New Delhi today the Minister emphasized that ‘Gaon, Garib, Kisan’ is always at the centre of Prime Minister’s thoughts and actions and all these initiatives are aimed at fulfilling the vision of doubling farmers’ income by 2022.



The Minister said that being an important sector Agriculture should play a stabilising role in the economy and for this modernisation and technological advancements are required in the field to which the ICAR can contribute immensely. The Minister added that this series of discussions with Farmers that started with Rajasthan in July should continue with every other state as this initiative will definitely help in the prosperity of the farming community. Calling on the farmers to adopt modern technologies, the Minister said that the discussions and learning from the two day session shall be taken forward to practising in the agricultural fields.

 

Enumerating the major challenges in the Agriculture sector such as providing market connectivity and promoting agricultural exports, Shri Tomar said that amongst these one major challenge is farmers not getting proper value for their produce. For this he called for better coordination between the farmers and researchers in the field for improvement of agricultural produce. Indian products should be able to compete with products from across the world and thereby fetch best market value. Although farmers get subsidy and Government support, their aim should be not to solely rely on Government support but to take initiatives on their own to improve productivity.  Highlighting the importance of integrated and organic farming, the Minister said that the thought of farming as just growing grains should be changed to adoption of integrated farming wherein fisheries, poultry, animal husbandry and bee keeping etc. become part of farming. If every farmer starts doing this, the GDP share of agriculture shall increase.

 

Shri Sanjay Agarwal, Secretary, (DAC&FW) Ministry of Agriculture said that it is for the first time that Central Government is holding State specific discussions and that too directly with the farmers. The Secretary also said that the banking formalities have now been reduced and farmers can easily open accounts. Asking farmers to join for the new Farmers Pension scheme- PM Maan Dhan Yojana, the Secretary said that those farmers who have already registered for PM Kisan scheme will now start getting all information on their registered mobile phones.

 

Dr. Trilochan Mohapatra, Secretary (DARE) & DG (ICAR) stressed on the adoption of the newer and advanced technologies that will help in achieving the targeted goal of doubling the farmers’ income by the Year - 2022. Outlining few issues in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Dr. Mohapatra said that discussions shall be on how proper value for product can be ensured, market intervention through FPOs, role of Scientists & Institutes and how crop diversification can be made possible in these States.

 

The Minister also launched diagnostic kits, vaccines developed by different ICAR institutes and 8 ICAR mobile Apps during the occasion. More than 300 farmers from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, students, entrepreneurs, Vice Chancellors, Institute Directors are attending the two day brainstorming session

Registration for the PM Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana begins today said Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, while addressing a Press Conference in Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi today. Appealing farmers across the country to join the old age pension Scheme, the Minister said that the scheme has been envisioned with an aim to improve the life of small and marginal farmers of the country. The Minister said that the operational guidelines have been shared with the States and Agriculture Secretary Shri. Sanjay Agarwal conducted a Video Conference with States in this regard to ensure proper information dissemination and speedy implementation of the Scheme.



Elucidating the salient features of Scheme, Shri. Tomar said that the scheme is voluntary and contributory for farmers in the entry age group of 18 to 40 years and a monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- will be provided to them on attaining the age of 60 years. The farmers will have to make a monthly contribution of Rs.55 to Rs.200, depending on their age of entry, in the Pension Fund till they reach the retirement date i.e. the age of 60 years. The Central Government will also make an equal contribution of the same amount in the pension fund. The spouse is also eligible to get a separate pension of Rs.3000/- upon making separate contributions to the Fund. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) shall be the Pension Fund Manager and responsible for Pension pay out.

The Minister stated that, in case of death of the farmer before retirement date, the spouse may continue in the scheme by paying the remaining contributions till the remaining age of the deceased farmer. If the spouse does not wish to continue, the total contribution made by the farmer along with interest will be paid to the spouse. If there is no spouse, then total contribution along with interest will be paid to the nominee. If the farmer dies after the retirement date, the spouse will receive 50% of the pension as Family Pension. After the death of both the farmer and the spouse, the accumulated corpus shall be credited back to the Pension Fund. The beneficiaries may opt voluntarily to exit the Scheme after a minimum period of 5 years of regular contributions. On exit, their entire contribution shall be returned by LIC with an interest equivalent to prevailing saving bank rates.

The farmers, who are also beneficiaries of PM-Kisan Scheme, will have the option to allow their contribution debited from the benefit of that Scheme directly. In case of default in making regular contributions, the beneficiaries are allowed to regularize the contributions by paying the outstanding dues along with prescribed interest. The initial enrollment to the Scheme is being done through the Common Service Centres in various states.

                Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda launched a mobile application “Janaushadhi Sugam” and had announced that “Jan Aushadhi Suvidha Oxo-Biodegradable Sanitary Napkin” will now be available at only One Rupee per pad. Minister of State for Shipping (IC) and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya also graced thelaunch event held here today.

Making the announcement on the Jan Aushadhi Suvidha Oxo-Biodegradable Sanitary Napkins, Shri Gowda said that the assurance by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on this aspect about a year ago has been fulfilled now. He said that the “Janaushadhi Sugam” will enable people to search Janaushadhi generic medicines and the stores at the tip of their fingers.

 



 

The Minister of State Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya said that it is that about 28 million girls are reported to be leaving education because of lack of availability of good quality Sanitary Napkin” pads at reasonable cost. He said, Department of Pharmaceuticals is determined to provide affordable healthcare to all Indians through ever-increasing network of PMBJP Kendras across countryand this had already led to substantial savings to poor on medicines.

The Government of India launched “Jan Aushadhi Suvidha Oxo-Biodegradable Sanitary Napkin” at Rs 2.50 per pad on the eve of the World Environment Day 4thJune 2018. Jan Aushadhi Suvidha comes with a special additive, which makes it biodegradable when it comes in contact with oxygen after being discarded. Till 31st July 2019, over 1.30 crore pads were sold at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras.

In order to make these sanitary pads more affordable and accessible to the women of India, Government of India has now decided to make these pads available at rate of only Rs 1.00/- per pad as promised by the Prime Minister before the ‘Lok Sabha Election-2019’.

This is an important step in ensuring the health security forthe section of Indian women who still use unhygienic aids during menstrual period due to non-affordability of sanitary pads available in themarket. This will ensure ‘Swachhta, Swasthya and Suvidha’ for the underprivileged women of the country. This step taken by the Department of Pharmaceuticals will ensure the achievement of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of “Affordable and Quality Healthcare” for all. It will also help in fulfilling the Prime Minister’s dream of “Clean India & Green India” as these pads are oxo-biodegradable and environment friendly. Jan Aushadhi Suvidha is beingmade available for sale in more than 5500 PMBJP Kendras across the country.

“Janaushadhi Sugam” mobile application would have user-friendly options like- to locate nearby Janaushadhikendra, direction guidance for location of the Janaushadhikendra through Google Map, search Janaushadhi generic medicines, analyse product comparison of Generic vs Branded medicine in form of MRP & overall Savings, etc. The mobile application is available on both Android & iOS platforms. It can be downloaded free of cost by the user from Google Play Store and Apple Store.

                The NPPA notified the ceiling price of orthopaedic knee implants on 16th August, 2017 by invoking extraordinary powers, in public interest, under Para 19 of Drugs Prices Control Order (DPCO) 2013, for a period of one year. Subsequently, vide notification dated 13th August, 2018, the applicability of ceiling prices fixed for orthopaedic knee implants was extended for another one year,  up to 15th August, 2019.

Accordingly, the cost of knee implants was reduced significantly, upto 69%, resulting in a notional saving of Rs.1500 crore per annum to the consumers.

The NPPA, in its meeting held on 8th Aug, 2019, reviewed the matter. It was noted that there has been an increased access due to knee implants becoming affordable. As per the data submitted by manufacturers and importers, an increase of 30% in the sales of knee implants has been reported during the period of July, 2018 to June, 2019. 

The knee implant is a non-scheduled medical device / drug for which DPCO, 2013 allows an annual increase upto 10% of MRP. However, this was not permitted in 2018.

Though the industry has requested for a 20% (10% for the year 2018 and 10% for the year 2019) increase in the price of knee implants, it was decided to further monitor the price increase of knee implants as per para 20 of the DPCO, 2013 that restricts price increase beyond 10% in a given year. This shall be subject to a review after one year.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State(I/c) for Civil Aviation said, “Indian Aviation Industry has been instrumental in the overall economic development of the country. The aviation sector growth in the region has thrown up tremendous opportunity and challenges to India and other countries in the region. India as a State has been working with zeal to create infrastructure in Air Transport and Air Navigation Services. The high-quality airport infrastructure, growing economy and necessary Government support, adds to the potential of India becoming a global aviation hub.  India would be keen to offer solutions and support for aviation infrastructure, connectivity & capacity building to its immediate neighbourhood”.

 



Speaking at the Conference, Shri Pradeep Singh Kharola -  Secretary, MoCA, Government of India pointed out that Indian aviation sector has grown by leaps and bounds over the past few years. It was now in a position to support the regional cooperation operatives from the South Asian and South East Asian countries with rigorous inputs and engagements to upgrade infrastructure, build capacity and develop air connectivity and people to people linkages through technology transfers, capacity creation and sharing of know-how – in the infrastructure, technology and the capacity building fronts. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) – a Government of India Enterprise under MoCA had proven credentials as a leading Civil Aviation Company in India, with world class infrastructure, cutting edge aviation technology for capacity & safety of airspace, across Asia and Africa.        It was followed by Stakeholders’ Discussion and Special Briefing by Ambassadors / High Commissioners of the member countries of Asia Pacific Region.. 

The roundtable was significant as it highlighted key opportunities that could strengthen regional and bilateral partnerships. It was noted that Regional air connectivity and the development of aviation infrastructure and services amongst the nations in the South Asian and South East Asian region is a key driver for the increased growth of regional partnerships and development. India and its regional neighbours already share multiple lines of credit that cover projects in areas of airports and aviation, port construction, railways, roads, power & energy, telecommunications, and shipping etc.

                The decision of 100% FDI under automatic route for coal mining activities including associated processing, infrastructure in the coal sector is the biggest reform by Modi Government which will help provide power to all 24x7.

In a statement, Shri. Pralhad Joshi, Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines said, “100% FDI is the biggest reform of our times and the influx of international players will create an efficient and competitive coal market in India. It is expected to bring state of the art coal mining technology to the country which will help in environmentally sustainable mining.  This decision will also create direct and indirect employment in coal bearing areas and will have a positive impact in the economic development of these regions.” He said the reform is likely to help the coal bearing states get more revenue and bring in more players to create an efficient and competitive coal market.

Terming the measure as part of ease-of-doing-business he said it will provide impetus to the economy. Mr Joshi reiterated that this step will also lead to energy security of the country as 70% of India’s electricity is generated from thermal power plants.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for Review of Foreign Direct Investment on various sectors.

Major Impact and Benefits from FDI Policy Reform


	The changes in FDI policy will result in making India a more attractive FDI destination, leading to benefits of increased investments, employment and growth.
	In the coal sector, for sale of coal, 100% FDI under automatic route for coal mining,activities including associated processing infrastructure will attract international players to create an efficient and competitive coal market.
	Further, manufacturing through contract contributes equally to the objective of Make in India. FDI now being permitted under automatic route in contract manufacturing will be a big boost to Manufacturing sector in India.
	Easing local sourcing norms for FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT) was announced in Union Budget Speech of Finance Minister. This will lead to greater flexibility and ease of operations for SBRT entities, besides creating a level playing field for companies with higher exports in a base year. In addition, permitting online sales prior to opening of brick and mortar stores brings policy in sync with current market practices. Online sales will also lead to creation of jobs in logistics, digital payments, customer care, training and product skilling.
	The above amendments to the FDI Policy are meant to liberalize and simplify the FDI policy to provide ease of doing business in the country, leading to larger FDI inflows and thereby contributing to growth of investment, income and employment.


Background

FDI is a major driver of economic growth and a source of non-debt finance for the economic development of the country. Government has put in place an investor friendly policy on FDI, under which FDI up to 100% is permitted on the automatic route in most sectors/ activities. FDI policy provisions have been progressively liberalized across various sectors in recent years to make India an attractive investment destination. Some of the sectors include Defence, Construction Development, Trading, Pharmaceuticals, Power Exchanges, Insurance, Pension, Other Financial Services, Asset reconstruction Companies, Broadcasting and Civil Aviation.

These reforms have contributed to India attracting record FDI inflows in the last 5 years. Total FDI into India from 2014-15 to 2018-19 has been US $ 286 billion as compared to US $ 189 billion in the 5-year period prior to that (2009-10 to 2013-14). In fact, total FDI in 2018-19 i.e. US $ 64.37 billion (provisional figure) is the highest ever FDI received for any financial year.

 

Global FDI inflows have been facing headwinds for the last few years. As per UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2019, global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows slid by 13% in 2018, to US $1.3 trillion from US $1.5 trillion the previous year - the third consecutive annual decline. Despite the dim global picture, India continues to remain a preferred and attractive destination for global FDI flows. However, it is felt that the country has the potential to attract far more foreign investment which can be achieved inter-alia by further liberalizing and simplifying the FDI policy regime.

In Union Budget 2019-20, Finance Minister proposed to further consolidate the gains under FDI in order to make India a more attractive FDI destination. Accordingly, the Government has decided to introduce a number of amendments in the FDI Policy. Details of these changes are given in the following paragraphs.

Coal Mining

As per the present FDI policy, 100% FDI under automatic route is allowed for coal & lignite mining for captive consumption by power projects, iron & steel and cement units and other eligible activities permitted under and subject to applicable laws and regulations. Further, 100% FDI under automatic route is also permitted for setting up coal processing plants like washeries subject to the condition that the company shall not do coal mining and shall not sell washed coal or sized coal from its coal processing plants in the open market and shall supply the washed or sized coal to those parties who are supplying raw coal to coal processing plants for washing or sizing.

It has been decided to permit 100% FDI under automatic route for sale of coal, for coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure subject to provisions of Coal Mines (special provisions) Act, 2015 and the Mines and Minerals (development and regulation) Act, 1957 as amended from time to time, and other relevant acts on the subject. ""Associated Processing Infrastructure"" would include coal washery, crushing, coal handling, and separation (magnetic and non-magnetic)

Contract Manufacturing


	The extant FDI policy provides for 100% FDI under automatic route in manufacturing sector. There is no specific provision for Contract Manufacturing in the Policy. In order to provide clarity on contract manufacturing, it has been decided to allow 100% FDI under automatic route in contract manufacturing in India as well. 



	Subject to the provisions of the FDI policy, foreign investment in 'manufacturing' sector is under automatic route. Manufacturing activities may be conducted either by the investee entity or through contract manufacturing in India under a legally tenable contract, whether on Principal to Principal or Principal to Agent basis.


Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT)


	The extant FDI Policy provides that 30% of value of goods has to be procured from India if SBRT entity has FDI more than 51%. Further, as regards local sourcing requirement, the same can be met as an average during the first 5 years, and thereafter annually towards its India operations. With a view to provide greater flexibility and ease of operations to SBRT entities, it has been decided that all procurements made from India by the SBRT entity for that single brand shall be counted towards local sourcing, irrespective of whether the goods procured are sold in India or exported. Further, the current cap of considering exports for 5 years only is proposed to be removed, to give an impetus to exports.
	The extant Policy provides that as regards local sourcing requirement, incremental sourcing for global operations by the non-resident entities undertaking single brand retail trading, either directly or through their group companies, will also be counted towards local sourcing requirement for the first 5 years. However, prevalent business models involve not only sourcing from India for global operations by the entity or its group companies, but also through an unrelated third Party, done at the behest of the entity undertaking single brand retail trading or its group companies. In order to cover such business practices, it has been decided that 'sourcing of goods from India for global operations' can be done directly by the entity undertaking SBRT or its group companies (resident or non-resident}, or indirectly by them through a third party under a legally tenable agreement.
	The extant policy provides that only that part of the global sourcing shall be counted towards local sourcing requirement which is over and above the previous year's value. Such requirement of year-on-year incremental increase in exports induces aberrations in the system as companies with lower exports in a base year or any of ' the subsequent years can meet the current requirements, while a company with consistently high exports gets unduly discriminated against. It has been now decided that entire sourcing from India for global operations shall be considered towards local sourcing requirement. (And no incremental value)
	The present policy requires that SBRT entities have to operate through brick and mortar stores before starting retail trading of that brand through e-commerce. This creates an artificial restriction and is out of sync with current market practices. It has therefore been decided that retail trading through online trade can also be undertaken prior to opening of brick and mortar stores, subject to the condition that the entity opens brick and mortar stores within 2 years from date of start of online retail. Online sales will lead to creation of jobs in logistics, digital payments, customer care, training and product skilling.


Digital Media

The extant FDI policy provides for 49% FDI under approval route in Up-linking of 'News &Current Affairs' TV Channels. It has been decided to permit 26% FDI under government route for uploading/ streaming of News & Current Affairs through Digital Media, on the lines of print media.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for Review of Foreign Direct Investment on various sectors.

Major Impact and Benefits from FDI Policy Reform


	The changes in FDI policy will result in making India a more attractive FDI destination, leading to benefits of increased investments, employment and growth.
	In the coal sector, for sale of coal, 100% FDI under automatic route for coal mining,activities including associated processing infrastructure will attract international players to create an efficient and competitive coal market.
	Further, manufacturing through contract contributes equally to the objective of Make in India. FDI now being permitted under automatic route in contract manufacturing will be a big boost to Manufacturing sector in India.
	Easing local sourcing norms for FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT) was announced in Union Budget Speech of Finance Minister. This will lead to greater flexibility and ease of operations for SBRT entities, besides creating a level playing field for companies with higher exports in a base year. In addition, permitting online sales prior to opening of brick and mortar stores brings policy in sync with current market practices. Online sales will also lead to creation of jobs in logistics, digital payments, customer care, training and product skilling.
	The above amendments to the FDI Policy are meant to liberalize and simplify the FDI policy to provide ease of doing business in the country, leading to larger FDI inflows and thereby contributing to growth of investment, income and employment.


Background

FDI is a major driver of economic growth and a source of non-debt finance for the economic development of the country. Government has put in place an investor friendly policy on FDI, under which FDI up to 100% is permitted on the automatic route in most sectors/ activities. FDI policy provisions have been progressively liberalized across various sectors in recent years to make India an attractive investment destination. Some of the sectors include Defence, Construction Development, Trading, Pharmaceuticals, Power Exchanges, Insurance, Pension, Other Financial Services, Asset reconstruction Companies, Broadcasting and Civil Aviation.

These reforms have contributed to India attracting record FDI inflows in the last 5 years. Total FDI into India from 2014-15 to 2018-19 has been US $ 286 billion as compared to US $ 189 billion in the 5-year period prior to that (2009-10 to 2013-14). In fact, total FDI in 2018-19 i.e. US $ 64.37 billion (provisional figure) is the highest ever FDI received for any financial year.

 

Global FDI inflows have been facing headwinds for the last few years. As per UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2019, global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows slid by 13% in 2018, to US $1.3 trillion from US $1.5 trillion the previous year - the third consecutive annual decline. Despite the dim global picture, India continues to remain a preferred and attractive destination for global FDI flows. However, it is felt that the country has the potential to attract far more foreign investment which can be achieved inter-alia by further liberalizing and simplifying the FDI policy regime.

In Union Budget 2019-20, Finance Minister proposed to further consolidate the gains under FDI in order to make India a more attractive FDI destination. Accordingly, the Government has decided to introduce a number of amendments in the FDI Policy. Details of these changes are given in the following paragraphs.

Coal Mining

As per the present FDI policy, 100% FDI under automatic route is allowed for coal & lignite mining for captive consumption by power projects, iron & steel and cement units and other eligible activities permitted under and subject to applicable laws and regulations. Further, 100% FDI under automatic route is also permitted for setting up coal processing plants like washeries subject to the condition that the company shall not do coal mining and shall not sell washed coal or sized coal from its coal processing plants in the open market and shall supply the washed or sized coal to those parties who are supplying raw coal to coal processing plants for washing or sizing.

It has been decided to permit 100% FDI under automatic route for sale of coal, for coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure subject to provisions of Coal Mines (special provisions) Act, 2015 and the Mines and Minerals (development and regulation) Act, 1957 as amended from time to time, and other relevant acts on the subject. ""Associated Processing Infrastructure"" would include coal washery, crushing, coal handling, and separation (magnetic and non-magnetic)

Contract Manufacturing


	The extant FDI policy provides for 100% FDI under automatic route in manufacturing sector. There is no specific provision for Contract Manufacturing in the Policy. In order to provide clarity on contract manufacturing, it has been decided to allow 100% FDI under automatic route in contract manufacturing in India as well.  



	Subject to the provisions of the FDI policy, foreign investment in 'manufacturing' sector is under automatic route. Manufacturing activities may be conducted either by the investee entity or through contract manufacturing in India under a legally tenable contract, whether on Principal to Principal or Principal to Agent basis.


Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT)


	The extant FDI Policy provides that 30% of value of goods has to be procured from India if SBRT entity has FDI more than 51%. Further, as regards local sourcing requirement, the same can be met as an average during the first 5 years, and thereafter annually towards its India operations. With a view to provide greater flexibility and ease of operations to SBRT entities, it has been decided that all procurements made from India by the SBRT entity for that single brand shall be counted towards local sourcing, irrespective of whether the goods procured are sold in India or exported. Further, the current cap of considering exports for 5 years only is proposed to be removed, to give an impetus to exports.
	The extant Policy provides that as regards local sourcing requirement, incremental sourcing for global operations by the non-resident entities undertaking single brand retail trading, either directly or through their group companies, will also be counted towards local sourcing requirement for the first 5 years. However, prevalent business models involve not only sourcing from India for global operations by the entity or its group companies, but also through an unrelated third Party, done at the behest of the entity undertaking single brand retail trading or its group companies. In order to cover such business practices, it has been decided that 'sourcing of goods from India for global operations' can be done directly by the entity undertaking SBRT or its group companies (resident or non-resident}, or indirectly by them through a third party under a legally tenable agreement.
	The extant policy provides that only that part of the global sourcing shall be counted towards local sourcing requirement which is over and above the previous year's value. Such requirement of year-on-year incremental increase in exports induces aberrations in the system as companies with lower exports in a base year or any of ' the subsequent years can meet the current requirements, while a company with consistently high exports gets unduly discriminated against. It has been now decided that entire sourcing from India for global operations shall be considered towards local sourcing requirement. (And no incremental value)
	The present policy requires that SBRT entities have to operate through brick and mortar stores before starting retail trading of that brand through e-commerce. This creates an artificial restriction and is out of sync with current market practices. It has therefore been decided that retail trading through online trade can also be undertaken prior to opening of brick and mortar stores, subject to the condition that the entity opens brick and mortar stores within 2 years from date of start of online retail. Online sales will lead to creation of jobs in logistics, digital payments, customer care, training and product skilling.


Digital Media

The extant FDI policy provides for 49% FDI under approval route in Up-linking of 'News &Current Affairs' TV Channels. It has been decided to permit 26% FDI under government route for uploading/ streaming of News & Current Affairs through Digital Media, on the lines of print media.

                In the last 6 years of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations, more than 100 stakeholders’ consultations have been held by the Department of Commerce and other lead Ministries and Departments of the Government of India seeking industry inputs for formulating India’s interests, covering a wide spectrum of the economy including agriculture, chemicals, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, textiles, ferrous and nonferrous metals, automobiles and machinery. 

The Department of Commerce also got industry feedback in the area of rules of origin, Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), antidumping, countervailing duties, safeguards measures and Intellectual Property Rights as well. The consultations also included, in recent times, comprehensive interactions with stakeholders under the guidance of the Minister for Commerce and Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal. Several industry consultations were also organised by FICCI, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, CII, ASSOCHAM and DGTR. 

State Governments are one of the important stake holders in these negotiations. Recognising this Commerce Secretaries have led delegations to various states and regular engagements have been held with Chief Secretaries and their teams of officials on the various aspects of RCEP so that they may be made aware of the developments and encouraged to further interact with industry and other stakeholders. Delegations have been led to the States of Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Assam, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan.

At the Ministerial level, RCEP has been represented and guided by Commerce Ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Suresh Prabhu, CR Chaudhary and Piyush Goyal over the past five years. Besides, in the various Working Groups/ Sub-Working Groups senior representatives of other Government Ministries/Departments have been leading the negotiations such as  Department of Revenue, Central Board for Indirect Taxes and Customs, Department of Economic Affairs, Department for Promotion of  Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Department of Commerce, Directorate  General of Trade Remedies, Department of Financial Services, Department of Telecommunication, Competition Commission of India, Reserve Bank of India. On other specific issues pertaining to other line Ministries/Departments, the Department of Commerce has been obtaining their inputs for framing India’s negotiating strategy in RCEP.  

RCEP negotiations began in November 2012, in Cambodia. RCEP negotiations are held at various levels - Prime Minster of India participates in the RCEP Summits while Commerce and Industry Minister leads the Indian delegation at the RCEP Ministerial Meetings and at the expert level senior officials of Department of Commerce take the lead in the Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC). Till date many officers of the Department of Commerce have led these negotiations like Rajiv Kher, Sumanto Chaudhary, J S Deepak, Dammu Ravi, Arvind Mehta, Anup Wadhawan and Sudhanshu Pandey. 

Department of Commerce also entrusted three autonomous think tanks viz. Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), IIM Bangalore and Centre for Regional Trade (CRT), New Delhi for making independent studies on RCEP with exhaustive consultations with stakeholders across the country.

Stakeholders’ inputs have been received in person from the Industry Associations/individual industries or industry clusters, by post and email. 

The database on Stakeholders’ Consultations is uploaded on the website of Department of Commerce at the following link: https://commerce.gov.in/writereaddata/uploadedfile/NTESCL637022544246650798_List_RCEP_stakeholders_consultation_23-08-2019.pdf

The RCEP is a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) between the ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ( Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) and its six FTA partners ( China, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand).

In 2017, prospective RCEP member states accounted for a population of 3.4 billion people with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP, PPP) of 49.5 trillion USD, approximately 39 percent of the world’s GDP, with the combined GDPs of India and China making up more than half that amount.

RCEP is the world’s largest economic bloc, covering nearly half of the global economy and is estimated that by 2050 the GDP of RCEP member states is likely to amount to nearly 250 trillion USD with the combined GDPs of India and China making up more than 75 percent of the amount.

                Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI) will launch two sub shows ‘Indusfood-Tech’ and ‘Indusfood-Chem’ in the forthcoming 2020 edition to be held in NCR Delhi next January. This will establish Indusfood as a fully integrated food processing lifecycle event.

He was speaking at an international dialogue on South-South and Triangular Cooperation today in New Delhi. Commerce and Industry Minister urged that all member countries must take up reforms of the WTO and not deal with issues in a piecemeal manner. We cannot afford to walk away from the current system but all member countries of the WTO must re-engage to ensure that  the rule-based, transparent, and non-discriminatory governance that free-trade requires is taken forward honestly and in a non-discriminatory manner and keeping in mind the interests of different member countries with disparate GDP. 

Piyush Goyal further stated that the policies of protectionism being followed by some countries in the developed world are affecting engagement between countries for trade in goods, services and protection of investments. 

The aspirations of people cannot be held back for a better life: for sustainable growth of the seven billion people of the world and India is committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and believes that peoples’ aspirations cannot be held back till 2030, said the Commerce and Industry Minister. India is not going to wait till 2030 to give access to energy, literacy and clean potable water to its people, India is fast-tracking its efforts to reach the SDGs to the last man at the bottom of the pyramid. India also desires that this pace of development reaches people in the rest of the world.

South-South cooperation is a broad framework of collaboration among countries of the South in the political, economic, social, cultural, environmental and technical domains. Involving two or more developing countries, it can take place on a bilateral, regional, intraregional, or interregional basis. South-South cooperation is a manifestation of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South and the attainment of the goals of Sustainable Development.

 Commerce and Industry Minister hoped that the South-South and Triangular Cooperation will help the developed world become a part of the developing world’s growth agenda.

                The Geographical Indication (GI) under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade hasrecenly registered 4 new GIs. PalaniPanchamirtham from Palani Town in Dindigul District of Tamil Nadu State, Tawlhlohpuan and Mizo Puancheifrom the state of Mizoram and Tirur Betel leaf from Kerala are the latest additions to the list of registered GIs. 

GI is an indication used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. Such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness which is essentially attributable to its origin in that defined geographical locality.

PalaniPanchamirtham, an abishegaPrasadam, from Palani Town is one of the main offerings in the Abisegam of Lord Dhandayuthapani Swamy, the presiding deity of ArulmiguDhandayuthapaniswamy Temple, situated in palani Hills, Palani Town in Dindigul District of Tamil Nadu. It is a combination of five natural substances, namely, banana, jaggery sugar, cow ghee, honey and cardamom in a definite proportion. It is prepared in a natural method without addition of any preservatives or artificial ingredients and is well known for its religious fervour and gaiety. This is the first time a temple ‘prasadam’ from Tamil Nadu has been bestowed with the GI tag. 

Tawlhlohpuan, a medium to heavy, compactly woven, good quality fabric from Mizoram is known for warp yarns, warping, weaving & intricate designs that are made by hand. Tawlhloh, in Mizo language, means 'to stand firm or not to move backward’. Tawlhlohpuan, which holds high significance in the Mizo society, is produced throughout the state of Mizoram, Aizawl and Thenzawl town being the main centre of production.

Mizo Puanchei, a colourful Mizo shawl/textile, from Mizoram, is considered as the most colourful among the Mizo textiles. It is an essential possession for every Mizo lady and an important marriage outfit in the state. It is also the most commonly used costume in Mizo festive dances and official ceremonies. The weavers insert the designs and motifs by using supplementary yarns while weaving to create this beautiful and alluring textile. 

Tirur betel vine from Kerala, which is mainly cultivated in Tirur, Tanur, Tirurangadi, Kuttippuram, Malappuram and Vengara block panchayaths of Malappuram District, is valued both for its mild stimulant action and medicinal properties. Even though it is commonly used for making pan masala for chewing, it has many medicinal, industrial and cultural usagesand is considered as a remedy for bad breath and digestive disorders.

GI products can benefit the rural economy in remote areas, by supplementing the incomes of artisans, farmers, weavers and craftsmen. India’s rural artisans possess unique skills and knowledge of traditional practices and methods, passed down from generation to generation, which need to be protected and promoted.The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade has taken several initiatives in this regard and is actively involved in promotion and marketing of GIs.

Piyush Goyalurged companies on both sides to use this special opportunity to come together to discuss partnerships directly with each other, and to come up with concrete project proposals and substantial outcomes.  The Plenary Session culminated with the signing of MoUs between regions of the Russian Far East and five states of India to expand and strengthen cooperation in the areas of trade, economy, investment, scientific and technical cooperation.

An MoU was signed between Amity University and Far East Federal University to enhance relations and develop academic and cultural exchange in the areas of education and research.  An agreement was also concluded on the establishment of the representative offices, the Centre for Yoga, and the Pushkin Centre for Russian Language and cultural studies.

                The Union Minister of Commerce and Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal, will leada delegation of Chief Ministers of States and business representatives to Vladivostok in the Russian Far East from 11-13 August 2019, to explore investment opportunities and strike close partnerships with the Far East provinces. 

The delegation includes Chief Ministers of Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh and an official from the State of Assam. The Chief Ministers of States will be accompanied by business delegations who will engage with officials and businessmen from the provinces in Russia’s eastern most territory. 

The Commerce and Industry Minister’s visit is a precursor to the visit of the Prime Minister, Narendra Modito Vladivostok in early September for the 5th edition of the Eastern Economic Forumwhere he will be the chief guest for the 20th edition of the Forum.It is an international forum held every year in Vladivostok, Russia, to support the economic development of Russia’s Far East region and to expand international cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.  

This visit by Piyush Goyal will set the stage for further strengthening of bilateral ties betweenthe two countries and also see major announcements on collaborative projects for the economic success of theFar East region of Russia.

India is looking to gain from the investment-friendly Russian stance in the natural resource-rich region, which includes significant incentives and tax breaks allowing Indian investments and labour for projects. Indian entities are already engaged in key sectors like power, coal, oil and gas, and this visit by India’s Commerce and Industry Minister, along with the delegation, will increase India’s footprint in the region further. 

The delegation includes more than 125 representatives from business stakeholders, who will interact with Russian counterparts on opportunities in the mining and processing of diamond and other rare metals, railways, agriculture, fisheries and food processing, oil and gas, forestry and timber, coal and power, ceramics, tourism, ship building, technical education, healthcare, and pharma sectors and Ayurveda.

Commerce and Industry Minister will also explore new areas of cooperation and ensure that India’s participation at the Eastern Economic Forum is meaningful.Thedelegationaccompanying Piyush Goyalwill identify and scope out and work on potential areas of business collaboration in this region of Russia. Russia’s Far East offers an important area for use of India’s skilled man power to develop the region that is vast and under populated. 

Russia ranks first in the world for oil and natural gas production, exports of steel, primary aluminum and nitrogen fertilizers. Russia is also the largest in terms of reserves of tin, zinc, titanium, niobium, nickel, iron ore, drinking water, natural gas, wood, diamonds and silver. 

Russia has the longest railways in the world -the Trans-Siberian Railway is the longest railway in the world of 87,157 kilometers. 

It is hoped that this visit of Piyush Goyal will mark the beginning of the process where both countries move away from a buyer-seller relationship to one where there is technology transfer,Make in India, job creation and content creation in India.

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal,held a meeting with senior managers of IT companies in New Delhi yesterday. The meeting was held to discuss opportunities for Indian IT companies to invest and grow their business in new markets like the Nordic countries, Eastern and Central Europe, Canada, Australia and Africa and also exploreavenues for greater investments and growth in East Asian markets like China, Japan and Korea.

India’s IT industry contributed 7.7% to the country’s GDP in FY 2017 and is expected to contribute 10% of India’s GDP by 2025. According to NASSCOM, the sector aggregated revenues of USD 160 billion in 2017. The United States account for 2/3rds of India’s IT services exports.

India’s IT and ITeS industry grew to USD 181 billion in 2018-19. Exports from the industry increased to USD 137 billion in FY 2019 while domestic revenues (including hardware) advanced to USD 44 billion.

During the discussions with Commerce and Industry Ministry, the representatives of the companies informed that although the Chinese IT services market is the third largest in the world India’s investments and business have not been able to grow in China due to various non-tariff barriersand challenges faced by Indian companies to set up their entity in China. Marketaccess issues that create hurdles for Indian companies to open their business in China was also discussed. 

The top five Indian IT service companies like TCS, WIPRO, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL are doing business in China for more than a decade and are employing 90% of local people in their China operations but returns are very low and thereforeIndian IT service companies are not showing much interest to invest and expand their operations in China.

Commerce and Industry Minister during the discussions requested National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and the senior managers of the companies attending the meeting to share specific data regarding non-tariff barriers being faced by them inChina and other East Asian markets. Government of India will give all support for the global growth of India’s flagship industry and will make all efforts to facilitate the IT service industry and for that it is ready to engage with China and also Japan and Korea, informed Piyush Goyal.

Commerce and Industry Minister urged India’s IT services companies to explore other markets and not be inhibited in operating in countries that are non-English speaking. He urged the top five Indian IT firms to create a corpus that will be spent on training manpower in languages like Mandarin, Japanese and Korean for accessing the markets in these countries. 

The meeting was attended by senior managers of TCS, Satyam Venture engineering, HCL, NIIT Tech, Infosys, Invento Robotics, Tech Mahindra and WIPRO. SangeetaGodbole, DG of Services Export Promotion Council (SEPC) and President of NASSCOM, Debjani Ghosh, were also present during the discussions with Commerce and Industry Minister. 

India is the largest exporter of IT services in the world and exports dominate the Indian IT industry and constitutes about 79% of the total revenue of theindustry. India’s IT service sector is now gearing up to be the digital partner of intelligent automation like smart algorithms, bots and AI tools, which arefast becoming a part of every industry and an increasingly digital world.

                 The Government today reiterated its commitment in providing Wi-Fi in all the villages through GramNet with connectivity between 10mbps to 100 mbps speed. Delivering a keynote address at the 36th Foundation Day celebrations of C-DOT here, Minister of State for Communications Shri Sanjay Shamrao Dhotre said that BharatNet also plans to provide 1 GBPS connectivity, which can be expanded up to 10 GBPS and C-DOT’s XGS-PON launched today will help in a great way to achieve this. He said, when India is celebrating 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, this will be a real tribute to Bapu, who had dreamt of a self-reliant Indian village.

Mr Dhotre said that C-Sat-Fi technology of C-DOT will empower Indian People especially in rural and remote areas as telephone and Wi-Fi facilities will be available in all corners of the country on any mobile phone. He said that the new technology will bring people in remote areas to mainstream by connecting them through satellites, where fiber is difficult to be laid and internet is not available.

The Minister launched C-DOT’s latest innovations, “C-Sat-Fi (C-DOTSatellite WiFi”, “XGSPON (10 G Symmetrical Passive Optical Network)” and “C-DOT’s Interoperable Set Top Box (CiSTB).

Speaking on the occasion, the Executive Director of C-DOT Mr Vipin Tyagi said that C-Sat-Fi (C-DOT Satellite WiFi) is based on the optimal utilization of wireless and satellite communication to extend connectivity to the unserved areas including the remote islands and difficult terrains. Besides offering the ease of deployment, the solution is ideally suited to addressing disasters and emergencies when no other means of communication are available, he added. This cost-effective solution does not require the expensive Satellite Phones and can work on any WiFi enabled phone.

Similarly, C-DOT’s XGSPON (10 G Symmetrical Passive Optical Network) is an effective solution to fulfil the rapidly increasing demands of high network speeds emanating from the new dimensions of user applications like IPTV, HD Video Streaming, Online Gaming and host of other cloud based services that necessitate the seamless availability of high bandwidth.

The third innovation, C-DOT’s Interoperable Set Top Box (CiSTB) will prove to be a boon to the dissatisfied customers who cannot change their Cable TV operator in view of the recurring costs of setting and installing the physical infrastructure afresh. Based on a portable smart card like a mobile SIM, this solution will revolutionize the experience of the Cable TV operators by offering them a high degree of choice, ease and convenience without having to replace the once installed STB.

The Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT), the premier Telecom R&D centre of the Government of India is observing its 36th Foundation Day celebrations on 26-27 August, 2019. This year too, continuing the same tradition, C-DOT held a technical conference as part of GB Meemamsi Lecture Series 2019, wherein several field experts, Telecom veterans and academicians from around the world shared their experiences and discussed innovative ways to address the numerous issues and challenges faced by the technology developers, policy makers and end-users in the new era defined by the all-pervasive “Internet of Things (IoT)”. The conference was jointly organized by C-DOT and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) under the aegis of European Union (EU) funded project on “India-EUCooperation on ICT- Related Standardization, Policy and Legislation” in association with Telecommunications Standards Development Society, India (TSDSI).

The inaugural session of the celebrations was graced by Hon’ble Minister of State for Communications Shri Sanjay Shamrao Dhotre, Mr. Luis Jorge Romero, Director General, ETSI and H.E. Raimund Magis, Charge d’Affaires, European Union delegation to India and several senior officials of the Ministry of Telecommunications.

Besides, insightful deliberations on a wide range of contemporary subjects spanning the critical need of IoT/M2M standardization and its impact on digital economy with special emphasis on oneM2M which has emerged as the Global Standard for IoT/M2M, various security and data protection aspects related to IoT/M2M deployments, diverse applications and use cases of IoT/M2M, the upcoming trends of LiFi and WiFi 6 and a session dedicated to the standardized implementation of Smart Cities. This conference becomes very topical and important as TEC is currently in the process of deciding on oneM2M as the national standard of IoT/M2M.

                [CURTAIN RAISER] 

(Click here to see Media Invitation)

The Fifth National Consultation Meeting of State Ministers of Food Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection will be held on 3rd September 2019. The event is significant in the context of the New Consumer Protection Act, 2019 notified recently. The CPA, 2019 proposes to establish a Central Consumer Protection Authority to deal with Unfair trade practices besides paving the way for digitalization of Consumer Commissions, enabling e-filing of complaints, Mediation, Product liability law and much simplified procedures. The Model Rules approved by Supreme Court to bring in uniformity in service conditions of Consumer Commission Presidents and Members shall bring in significant changes in the effective functioning of these Commissions for delivery of consumer justice. 

To enable coordinated action to discuss these issues, the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution has called this meeting of all State Food Ministers on 3rd  September 2019 at New Delhi. The event will be a day long affair with contribution by Ministers and Officials of Agriculture, Food and Public Distribution, Consumer Affairs, Health &Family Welfare, Industry & Commerce as well as Chemicals &Fertilizers.

The Conference will have discussions on a plethora of issues. Significant among them is the new pilot scheme to promote nutrition security in the country, on Fortification of Rice & its Distribution through the “Public Distribution System” with an outlay of `. 147.61 crores for a period of 3 years beginning 2019-20. The Pilot Scheme would be funded by Government of India in the ratio of 90:10 for North Eastern, Hilly and Island States and 75:25 for other States. 

High on the agenda of the meeting will be off-take from buffer stock of Pulses and Onion by the States for effective market intervention in the lean season. As on 11.07.2019, the available stock of pulses in PSF buffer is around 14 LMT.  States have been tasked to meet their requirement of pulses for various welfare schemes - Mid-day meal, anganwadi scheme, hospitals, Hostels. A discussion will be held on the measures taken by States on the action points decided in the last meeting held in May 2018 to check unreasonable increase in prices of some food items, especially, pulses, edible oils and sugar and prevent hoarding and black-marketing. The meeting will also review action taken on the decisions of the last meeting of the State Food Ministers and prepare a fresh action plan.

Keeping the prices of all essential food items under control and fully digitizing public distribution has been a priority of the Government. With National Food Security already in place, the focus is now on reforms of the PDS sector and Aadhaar seeding of Ration cards. In the last year Government acting in coordination with States was able to keep prices of Pulses and Sugar under check. 

Government is keeping a close watch on trends of prices of essential food items as it affects all, especially the poor and vulnerable sections of the society. The Price Monitoring Cell of the Consumer Affairs Department is monitoring the prices of selected food items as well as the structural and other constraints affecting their availability, and ensuring timely intervention for improving the market availability and thereby moderating prices. The Price Monitoring Cell (PMC) is collecting wholesale and retail prices of 22 essential commodities on a daily basis from selected 100 centres across the country. The prices compiled by PMC are used at the highest levels of decision making in Government for regularly reviewing the overall situation including commodity-specific trends for taking appropriate decisions including market-intervention, if required.

In the National Consultation Meeting of Ministers in-charge of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs held on 21st May 2018, it was decided that an Action Plan be prepared for implementation by the States/UTs to keep the prices of essential food items at reasonable level, especially during the festive season (July to December).  The meeting may deliberate on the actions taken by other States/UTs and prepare a fresh action plan including issues like imposition of stock limits on Onion and Edible oils, Sugar and setting up Price Stabilization Funds by the States.

The Conference will also see discussion on issues related to Consumer protection such as implementation of Legal Metrology Act & Rules, strengthening of consumer Fora and State Consumer Helplines, Consumer Welfare Fund administration, start of inter-state portability under one-nation one-ration card system, EPOS availability in ration shops and aadhaar seeding of Ration Cards etc. Also the meeting will discuss issues relating to action taken by States under delegation of Powers under the EC Act and creation of Price Stabilization Fund by the States for effective market intervention.
Steps have been taken to introduce Mandatory Hallmarking of Gold Jewellery and a Quality Control Order has been prepared and uploaded on the website of the Department of Consumer Affairs.
Doubling farmer’s income by 2022 is one of the priority objective of the Government.  For achieving this objective, significant step up in investment in the farm sector is required. The Essential Commodities Act, 1955, considered as one of the factors adversely affecting investment in the farm sector and in the supply-chain” has already been liberalized through the Central Order of 29th September 2016.  

A Contract Farming Order of 6th August 2019 exempts any agricultural produce by a contract farming purchaser  from stock limit subject to overall ceiling of  quantity registered with the State. exempting the purchase  of any agricultural produce  by a contract farming purchaser  from stock limit subject  to overall ceiling of  quantity registered with the  State Steps have also been initiated to rationalize punishment and penalties under the Essential Commodities Act.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for providing a lump sum export subsidy @ Rs. 10,448 per Metric Tonne (MT) to sugar mills for the sugar season 2019-20.  The total estimated expenditure of about Rs.6,268 crore will be incurred for this purpose.

The lump sum export subsidy will be provided for expenses on marketing costs including handling, upgrading and other processing costs, costs of international and internal transport and freight charges on export of up to 60 Lakh Metric Tonne (LMT) of sugar limited to Maximum Admissible Export Quantity (MAEQ) allocated to sugar mills for the sugar season 2019-20. 

The subsidy would be directly credited into farmers’ account on behalf of mills against cane price dues and subsequent balance, if any, would be credited to mill’s account.  [[The subsidy shall be in conformity with the provisions of Article 9.1 (d) & (e) of Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and thus WTO compatible.

In wake of surplus sugar production during sugar season 2017-18(October – September) and sugar season 2018-19, notwithstanding various measures taken by the Government, the ensuing sugar season 2019-20 is expected to commence with an opening stock of about 142 LMT and season end stock are expected to be about 162 LMT.

Background:  

            The surplus stock of 162 LMT of sugar would create downward pressure throughout the season on sugar prices affecting liquidity of the sugar mills thereby leading to accumulation of cane price arrears of farmers.

To deal with this situation, the Government has recently created buffer stock of 40 LMT of sugar for one year from 1st August, 2019. However, even after taking into account this buffer stocking of 40 LMT till 31stJuly, 2020 and likely diversion of sugar by way of production of ethanol from B-heavy molasses/cane juice during SS 2019-20 and requirement of  normativestock for two months, there shall be about 60 LMT of excess sugar stock that will need evacuation through export.

The Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan today critically and minutely examined the production, availability, consumption pattern, import and export of all pulses, oilseeds and Onions with senior officials from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Agriculture, Commerce and NAFED. 

Addressing the media after the review meeting, Shri Paswan stated that prices are likely to remain stable and there is ample availability of all pulses, oilseeds and onions in the country. Shri Paswan said that the total availability of pulses was 317 lakh tonnes in 2018-19, out of which 280 lakh tonnes have been consumed and we have 37 lakh tonnes of pulses available at present. Apart from this, the production of pulses is estimated to be 260 lakh tonnes and import of 10 lakh tonnes is estimated this year. A total of 307 lakh tonnes of pulses will be available with the government in the current year, of which 290 lakh tonnes is estimated to be consumed. Thus we have no shortage of pulses. The Minister also asserted if hoarding occurs anywhere, the government will take strong measures against it.

Shri Paswan further added that there is no shortage of edible oils either. The country produced 103 lakh tonnes of oil in 2016-17, while the demand was 250 lakh tonnes. 146 lakh tonnes of oil was imported. This time also the production of oil is expected to be 103 lakh tonnes and demand is 250 lakh tonnes. The shortage of edible oil will be bridged by imports. Oil prices in the market are also almost stable compared to last year.

The Union Minister said that the price situation is being closely monitored and if necessary, suitable action will be taken to ensure that all essential commodities are available to the consumers at a reasonable price. Shri Paswan further said that 50,000 MT Onion buffer is available with NAFED and State governments can exercise the option of buying from the central government buffer to increase their supply according to their requirement.

Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) reviewed the price situation of Onion in Delhi in a High Level meeting chaired by the Secretary, DoCA Shri Avinash K. Srivastava with all the concerned stakeholders including MD NAFED, MD NCCF,Safal,and others. Onions for retailing by Safal is being made available at present from the government stock built under Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF).  It was decided that retail priceof onion at Safal would not be allowed to exceed Rs 23.90/- per kg (for Grade A variety) i.e., theprice prevailing at their outlets as on 21st August, 2019. For this, Safal will continue to receive onions from the government buffer at the same rate at which it was offered on 21st August, 2019. Safal was also asked to double the quantity of its retailing operations for onions.NAFED and NCCF were also directed toretail onions at prices similar to that of Safal through their outlets and mobile vans. Further, onions from the government buffer would be offered at cost price to large retailers for supplies to public at reasonable prices. The price situation would be monitored regularly by the department for appropriate intervention.

Government will also consider strict action against hoarding and profiteering activities and evaluate the need for imposing minimum export price (MEP) on onion if the situation so demands.

The Consumer Protection Act 2019 will be more holistic and  stringent once the rules are framed to protect the interest of the Consumer ,stating this at a press conference today Union Minister for Consumer Affairs ,Food and Public distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswan informed that a meeting of former Secretaries of the Consumer Affairs Department and  Members of Parliament will be called this month for consultation before framing and finalising  the rulesunder this Act . He informed that 41 Members of Parliament participated in the debate when the Consumer Protection Bill was passed. Citing the number of pending cases before the consumer courts the Minister said that one of the reasons for this is that a number of posts are lying vacant and the effort will be to fill these up soon.He said that the idea of the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) is new and revolutionary and it will give more teeth to the provide relief for consumers.

Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ramvilas Paswan further said that through the new Act, the examination of manufactured products can be done on multiple levels such as before, during or after the purchase and if the product is found to be faulty at any level then the entire batch of the product will be withdrawn from the market. The Act, among other things, proposes setting up of a Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to promote, protect and enforce the rights of consumers as a class. The CCPA would make interventions to prevent consumer detriment arising from unfair trade practices. The agency can also initiate class action, including enforcing recall, refund and return of products. 

The Act also envisages simplified dispute resolution process, has provision for Mediation and e-filing of cases.  The Consumer will be able to file cases in the nearest commission under the jurisdiction of which he resides.

For the first time there will be an exclusive law dealing with Product Liability. A manufacturer or product service provider or product seller will now be responsible to compensate for injury or damage caused by defective product or deficiency in services.

Presently the Consumer has only a single point of access to justice, which is time consuming. Additional swift executive remedies are proposed in the Act through CCPA. There are provisions for deterrent punishment to check misleading advertisements and adulteration of products; Product liability provision to deter manufacturers and service providers from delivering defective products or deficient services. The Act also enables regulations to be notified on E-commerce and direct selling with focus on protection of interest of consumers.

In a major step towards achieving the objective of ‘One Nation One Ration Card’, the Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswan today inaugurated the inter-State portability in two clusters of adjoining States of Andhra Pradesh & Telangana and Gujarat & Maharashtra. This will enable beneficiaries from either States’ cluster to avail the benefits accruing to them under the National Food Security Act from any of the two States. 

Addressing the media after inaugurating the inter-State portability Shri Ram Vilas Paswan said that today marks the beginning of National level portability of Ration Cards which has begun with the two States’ clusters.Shri Paswan further stated that after leveraging the progress under Computerization scheme, 11 States/UT of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and Tripura have implemented the intra-State portability of ration card holders to lift the entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop within their State.Further, it is envisaged that the inter-State portability shall be introduced in the 11 States having already implemented intra-State portability by 1st January 2020.  

Shri Paswan further added that all other States/UTs having attained requisite readiness for inter-State portability, shall be integrated in a phased manner. Thereby, enabling nation-wide portability of ration card holders to receive subsidized foodgrains under NFSA from anywhere in the country by 1st June 2020. The Union Minister said that this initiative shall be very helpful for the large migratory population of the country who migrate from one part of the country to other in search of job/employment, marriage, or any other reason and find difficulty in accessing subsidized foodgrains in the present system.

To sustain the reforms brought in by the ongoing scheme of ‘End-to-End Computerization of TPDS Operations’ and to introduce new reforms, the Department of Food & Public Distribution, is targeting implementation of nation-wide portability in distribution of subsidised foodgrains to the beneficiaries without the need of obtaining a new ration card under ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ System.

Installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices at Fair Price Shops (FPSs) is the main enabler of portability of ration card holders, supported by the biometric/Aadhaar authentication.More than 4.1 lakh (77%) ePoS devices are already operational across the country. 25 States/UTs have either completed the installation in all FPSs or having significant progress in this area. Further, more than 85% ration cards (at least one member) in the country have been seeded with the Aadhaar numbers of the beneficiaries.

Consumer Protection Bill, 2019 would ease the overall process of consumer grievance redressal: Shri Ramvilas Paswan

 

The Parliament today gave its nod to the landmark Consumer Protection Bill, 2019 which aims to protect the rights of consumers by establishing authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers’ dispute. The Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 30th July, 2019 and was passed by Rajya Sabha today through a voice vote. The Bill will replace the more than three decades old Consumer Protection Act, 1986.

Moving the bill for consideration and passing in Rajya Sabha, Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Shri Ramvilas Paswan said that the new legislation would ease the overall process of consumer grievance redressal. Shri Paswan said that this new bill will provide a better mechanism to dispose consumer complaints in a speedy manner and will help in disposal of large number of pending cases in consumer courts across the nation. Shri Paswan stated that this bill was a long pending legislation and all the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee were incorporated in the bill except for five recommendations.  Shri Paswan also assured all the members of Parliament that their suggestions would be incorporated in the rules to the extent possible within the legal framework.

 

The bill, among other things, proposes setting up of a Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to promote, protect and enforce the rights of consumers as a class. The CCPA would make interventions to prevent consumer detriment arising from unfair trade practices. The agency can also initiate class action, including enforcing recall, refund and return of products. 

The Bill also envisages simplified dispute resolution process, has provision for Mediation and e-filing of cases.  The Consumer will be able to file cases in the nearest commission under the jurisdiction of which he resides.

For the first time there will be an exclusive law dealing with Product Liability. A manufacturer or product service provider or product seller will now be responsible to compensate for injury or damage caused by defective product or deficiency in services.

Additional swift executive remedies are proposed in the bill through CCPA. There are provisions for deterrent punishment to check misleading advertisements and adulteration of products. Product liability provision to deter manufacturers and service providers from delivering defective products or deficient services. The Bill also enables regulations to be notified on E-commerce and direct selling with focus on protection of interest of consumers.

                Ministry of Corporate Affairs has issued a circular today clarifying the import of section 232(6) of the Companies Act, 2013, which deals with the requirement of indicating an “appointed date” in the scheme of mergers and amalgamations, which would also be the effective date of the merger/amalgamation coming into force.

A view was being taken in some quarters that the “appointed date” in the scheme need always be a definite calendar date, which led to difficulties for companies intending to give effect to their merger at a future/event-linked date, based on business considerations, fulfilling legal requirements such as procurement of license from sectoral regulators, etc. Besides this, IndAS 103 (Business Combinations), which deals with the accounting treatment, uses the expression “acquisition date”, as a date when the acquirer takes control of the acquiree, also required clarification.

The circular clarifies that the companies may choose the “appointed date” of the merger/amalgamation based on occurrence of an event, which is relevant to the merger between companies. This would allow the companies concerned to function independently till such event is actually materialised. The circular further clarifies that the term “appointed date” used in section 232(6) shall be deemed to be the “acquisition date” for the purpose of conforming to IndAS 103 standard dealing with business combinations.

This clarification would lead to harmonisation of practices in ascertaining the “appointed date” of merger/amalgamation and provide due clarity on the accounting treatment, thereby allowing stakeholders to align the “appointed date” of merger/amalgamation in accordance with their business considerations or legal requirements. This would also contribute significantly in the ease of Doing Business.

                The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has amended the Companies (Share Capital & Debentures) Rules by removing Debenture Redemption Reserve requirement for Listed Companies, NCFCs and HFCs.

The decision has been taken in pursuance of the Budget announcements for 2019-20 by Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman and the Government’s objectives of providing greater ‘Ease of Doing Business’ to companies in the country, as part of its 100 Days Action Plan.

Through these amendments, the provisions relating to creation of Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR) have been revised with the objective of;


	removing the requirement for creation of a DRR of 25% of the value of outstanding debentures in respect of listed companies, NBFCs registered with RBI and for Housing Finance Companies registered with National Housing Bank (NHB) both for public issue as well as private placements;
	Reduction in DRR for unlisted companies from the present level of 25% to 10% of the outstanding debentures.


Hitherto, Listed Companies had to create a DRR for both Public Issue as well as Private Placement of Debentures, while NBFCs & HFCs had to create DRR only when they opted for Public Issue of Debentures.  It is aimed at creating a level-playing field between NBFCs, HFCs and listed companies’ on the one hand and also between them and Banking Companies & All India Financial Institutions on the other, which are already exempted from DRR.

The measure has been taken by the Government with a view to reducing the cost of the capital raised by companies through issue of debentures and is expected to significantly deepen the Bond Market.

The rules, while retaining DRR requirement for Unlisted Companies, provide for reduction from a DRR of 25% to a DRR of 10% for such companies, so as to safeguard interests of investors.

                            The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has amended the provisions relating to issue of shares with Differential Voting Rights (DVRs) provisions under the Companies Act with the objective of enabling promoters of Indian companies to retain control of their companies in their pursuit for growth and creation of long-term value for shareholders, even as they raise equity capital from global investors.

            The key change brought about through the amendments to the Companies (Share Capital & Debentures) Rules brings in an enhancement in the previously existing cap of 26% of the total post issue paid up equity share capital to a revised cap of 74% of total voting power in respect of shares with Differential Voting Rights of a company. 

Another key change brought about is the removal of the earlier requirement of distributable profits for 3 years for a company to be eligible to issue shares with Differential Voting Rights.

            The above two initiatives have been taken by the Government in response to requests from innovative tech companies & startups and to strengthen the hands of Indian companies and their promoters who have lately been identified by deep pocketed investors worldwide for acquisition of controlling stake in them to gain access to the cutting edge innovation and technology development being undertaken by them. 

The Government had noted that such Indian promoters have had to cede control of companies which have prospects of becoming Unicorns, due to the requirements of raising capital through issue of equity to foreign investors. 

Alongside the above two changes, another major step taken is that the time period within which Employee Stock Options (ESOPs) can be issued by Startups recognized by the Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT) to promoters or Directors holding more than 10% of equity shares, has been enhanced from 5 years to 10 years from the date of their incorporation.

                The Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’) passed a final order with respect to cartelisation amongst NSK Limited, Japan (‘NSK’)and JTEKT Corporation, Japan (‘JTEKT’)and their Indian subsidiaries namely Rane NSK Steering Systems Ltd. (‘RNSS’) and JTEKT Sona Automotive India Limited (‘JSAI’)respectively,in relation to the supply of Electric Power Steering (‘EPS’) Systems to three automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (‘OEMs’), by means of directly or indirectly determining price, allocating markets, co-ordinating bid response and manipulating the bidding process in Request for Information/ Request for Quotations (‘RFIs/ RFQs’) issued by these three automobile OEMs. The duration of the cartel was found to be from 2005 to 25.07.2011. 

The case was initiated on the basis of an application received by the CCI under Section 46 of the Competition Act, 2002 (the ‘Act’) read with Competition Commission of India (Lesser Penalty) Regulations, 2009 (‘LPR’), from NSK/ RNSS. Thereafter, during the pendency of investigation, JTEKT/ JSAI also approached the CCI by filing an application under the Section 46 of the Act read with the LPR.

The evidence collected in the case included instances of meetings and telephonic exchanges in which commercially sensitive information about prices etc. was discussed. Such conduct of the parties was found to have caused appreciable adverse effect on competition in India. Accordingly, the CCI concluded that NSK and JTEKT, and their Indian subsidiaries RNSS and JSAI respectively, indulged into anti-competitive conduct in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(3)(a) read with Section 3(1) of the Act. 

Considering all the relevant factors, penalty, in terms of the proviso to Section 27 (b) of the Act, was computed for each party, from the date of enforcement of the provisions of Section 3 of the Act i.e. 20.05.2009 till 25.07.2011. In terms thereof, the penalty to be imposed upon NSK/RNSSwas computed at the rate of 4% of the relevant turnover of RNSS and uponJTEKT/JSAI,at the rate of 1 time of the relevant profit of JSAI.Also, considering the totality of facts and circumstances of the case, penalty, in terms of Section 27 (b) of the Act, to be imposed on the individuals of NSK and JTEKT, held liable under Section 48 of the Act, was computed at the rate of 10 percent of the average of their income for the preceding three years.

In view of the fact that NSK/ RNSS was the first to approach the Commission as a Lesser Penalty applicant and had provided complete, true and full disclosures, 100 percent reduction in penalty was granted to NSK/ RNSS and its individuals and the penalty to be paid by them is nil. Further, in view of the fact that JTEKT/ JSAI was the second to approach the Commission as a Lesser Penalty applicant and had provided significant value addition in the matter, 50 percent reduction in penalty was granted to JTEKT/ JSAI and its individuals. Therefore, the total penalty to be paid by JTEKT/ JSAI is INR 17,07,31,443/-.

                Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary (Corporate Affairs), today presented the Report of the High Level Committee on CSR to the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman.

 

The Committee has made far reaching recommendations.  The main recommendations  include, making CSR expenditure tax deductible, provision for carry forward of unspent balance for a period of 3 – 5 years, aligning Schedule 7 with the SDGs by adopting a SDG plus framework (which would additionally include sports promotion, Senior Citizens’  welfare, welfare of differently abled persons, disaster management and heritage protection), balancing local area preferences with national priorities, introducing impact assessment studies for CSR obligation of 5 crore or more, and registration of implementation agencies on MCA portal.  The other recommendations include developing a CSR exchange portal to connect contributors, beneficiaries and agencies, allowing CSR in social benefit bonds, promoting social impact companies, and third party assessment of major CSR projects.

The Committee has emphasized on not treating CSR as a means of resource gap funding for government schemes.  The Committee discourages passive contribution of CSR into different funds included in Schedule VII of the Act.  It has emphasized on CSR spending as a board driven process to provide innovative technology based solutions for social problems.  The Committee has also recommended that companies having CSR prescribed amount below Rs. 50 lakh may be exempted from constituting a CSR Committee.  The Committee has also recommended that violation of CSR compliance may be made a civil offence and shifted to the penalty regime.

The High Level Committee on CSR was constituted in October, 2018 under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Corporate Affairs) to review the existing CSR framework and make recommendations on strengthening the CSR ecosystem, including monitoring implementation and evaluation of outcomes.  The Members of the Committee included Shri Sameer Sharma, DG & CEO, Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs, Dr. A.K. Mittal, former CMD, NBCC, Shri N. Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons, Shri Amit Chandra, MD, Bain Capital Private Equity, Shri B.S. Narasimha, former Addl. Solicitor General of India, Shri Rajeev Luthra, Founder & MD, Luthra and Luthra Law Office, Smt. Shobana Kamineni,  Executive Vice Chairperson, Apollo,    Prof. Anil Gupta, Founder, Honey Bee Network and Professor, IIM, Ahmedabad, Dr. Narinder Dhruv Batra, President, Indian Olympic Association, Shri S. Santhanakrishnan. Chartered Accountant, and Shri Mathew Cherian, CEO, Helpage India.  Shri Gyaneshwar Kumar Singh, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, was the Member and Convener.

The full report has been uploaded in the MCA Website.

                The historic Qutb Minar came alive as it saw the first ever architectural LED illumination inaugurated by Minister of State for Culture & Tourism (I/C) Shri Prahalad Singh Patel in New Delhi today. With the illumination, the architectural beauty of the 12th century monument will display its historic magesty after sunset.  

Speaking on the occasion,  Shri Prahlad Singh Patel said that Qutb Minar complex is a true reflection of India's culture and contains history of several eras . The bottom to top illumination of this magnificient monument will highlight the true beauty of its elements. The systematic development of the Qutb complex will not only increase footfall of visitors but also benefit communities around it, the Minister added. 

Highlighting the importance of public facilitation at such monuments, the Culture Minister said that recently we have setup a Baby feeding Centre at the Taj Mahal, Agra and many such feeding centres will also be set up in all ASI protected UNESCO world heritage sites.

He further added that the Prime Minister has set the goal of doubling foreign and domestic tourists in next 5 years. In order to achieve this goal, we must change global  perception about our country to promote tourism, he explained.

To highlight the archaeological magnificence of country's historical monuments, Archaeological Survey of India has taken up the project to illuminate important monuments of Delhi. Earlier, the illumination of Red Fort, Humayun’s Tomb, Purana Qila and Safdarjung Tomb has already been completed. Tughlakabad Fort is also expected to be illuminated in near future. 

Continuing its endeavor to promote India’s glorious culture and Heritage, ASI under the Ministry of Culture, Government India is committed to showcase India’s cultural vibrancy to the entire world. The move to illuminate the historic monuments will aim to showcase monuments during late evenings, thereby enhancing the visitor experience. As part of the effort to increase footfall in the evening, timings for public entry at Red Fort, Safdarjung Tomb and Humayun’s Tomb have also been extended to 9 pm. Qutb Minar, however, is already open till 10 pm. Also, in a new facility for visitor convenience, now the public can skip the queue at Qutb Minar and can purchase ticket for the monument at a discounted rate just by scanning the QR code through their mobile camera. 

To highlight the architectural beauty including arches and minarets of the Qutb Minar, a total of 358 technologically advanced LED lights have been used which will consume 62% less electricity than conventional light fixtures. Warm lights will highlight the architectural features on the monument’s facade. Apart from the minaret, the pathways and smaller structures around the Qutb Minar have also been lit. The new illumination comprises lighting that accentuates the silhouette of the monument with the interplay of light and shade. The duration of illumination will be from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM daily with a monthly cost of Rs16,615/- which comes out merely to Rs 1,99,388/- for a year.

Qutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of those historical monuments which attracts thousands of tourists every year and is the proud jewel in Delhi’s history.

                The Minister of State for Culture & Tourism (Independent charge), Shri Prahlad Singh Patel  inaugurated ‘Gallery of Confiscated and Retrieved Antiquities’ at Purana Qila in New Delhi today. 

Curated by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the Gallery is located in the arched cells of Purana Qila and displays confiscated and retrieved antiquities to public. 

Speaking to the media after tour of the gallery, Shri Prahlad Singh Patel said that it is a matter of pride that we have been able to retrieve the previous pieces of our heritage from abroad. The number of antiquities recovered in the last five years is the highest ever, he revealed. The Minister said that the credit goes to our Prime Minister who not only made efforts to help retrieve these antiquities but personally carried them back with him during his official tours abroad.  The recent success is  because of our continuously improving cultural relations with various countries of the world. The Minister lauded the tireless efforts of various government agencies like ASI, CBI , DRI among others in this endeavour. 

 The displayed heritage in the Gallery is a part of Central Antiquity Collection (CAC), located in Purana Qila which was created to house the antiquities explored and excavated by the ASI and also those antiquities which were retrieved and confiscated with the help of Ministry of External Affairs and various law enforcing agencies i.e. Police, CBI, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Custom officials. Presently, a total of 2,72,824 antiquities have been stored in the CAC out of which 4,144 are confiscated/retrieved antiquities.

The ‘Gallery of Confiscated and Retrieved Antiquities’ showcases a part display of 198 confiscated and retrieved antiquities belonging from ancient to modern period from the CAC collection. The exhibition also sensitizes the visitors about the illegal trade of precious heritage items and process and regulations for retrieving them.

Accordingly, the Gallery  displays two parallel narratives which will provide a holistic understanding of the importance of repatriation of smuggled antiquities. One of the narratives establishes the larger context of the museum display including the importance of cultural heritage; laws governing our heritage; theft and trafficking of cultural items and the process of retrieval of smuggled antiquities, while the other narrative will focus on the intrinsic aesthetic qualities and iconography of the artifacts. 

The display in the gallery ranges from proto-historic to modern period and affiliated to different provenances. The wide range of retrieved or confiscated antiquities includes stone and metal sculptures, coins, paintings, ivory and copper artifacts, architectural panels, etc. Some of the exclusive exhibits showcased in the gallery are Bronze sculptures of Parvati and Sridevi of Chola Period (brought back in 2016), Standing Buddha (returned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the year 1999), terracotta Mother Goddess of Mauryan period (brought back in the year 2016), Brahma-Brahmani (confiscated by Central Bureau of Investigation), Mithuna (seized in New York and brought back in the year 2010) and Kashmiri Harwan tile (returned to India by Consulate General of India, New York in the year 2016).

In the past, many of valuable antiquities, artifacts and sculptures have been stolen from India and are sold in foreign countries. As per the Antiquity and Art Treasures Act, 1972 and rules 1973, it is the duty of Archaeological Survey of India to stop theft, illegal export and regulates domestic trade of antiquities. 

So far, ASI, has retrieved 44 stolen antiquities from USA, Australia, Singapore, Germany, Canada and England and 119 more antiquities are in the process of retrieval. Owing to the efforts of ASI no theft has been reported from any Centrally Protected Monument or site museum under ASI during last few years. 

The gallery will remain open for public from 10.00 AM to 5.00 PM (except Friday).

As a part of Fit India Movement the Minister of State for Culture & Tourism (Independent charge), Shri Prahlad Singh Patel lead a morning walk at Humayun Tomb Complex today in New Delhi. Speaking on the occasion the Minister said that awareness regarding fitness lies in Indian culture and heritage and we must do some Yoga, exercise, walk or other related things for our better health in our day to day life. He also said that ‘health is Wealth’ and we can achieve our physical and spiritual goals only through a healthy body. The Minister urged all the citizens to participate in ‘Fit India Movement’ to make it a public movement. 



Shri Prahlad Singh Patel also opened the entry for Nila Gumbad at Humayun Tomb Complex for general public during his visit. The Nila Gumbad is one of the earliest Mughal era structure and was Built in the 1530’s. This was built on an island in the Yamuna, and later, just abutting to it, when Humayun’s Tomb was built in the year 1569-70, Nila Gumbad and other adjoining structures were incorporated in the complex. 



The entry to the Nila Gumbad, which derives its name from the turquoise blue tiles that cover its dome, has been made accessible to the public from inside the Humayun’s Tomb complex from today. 

The glory of Nila Gumbad started declining in 19th century when the northern portion of the Nila Gumbad garden was taken over by the railway lines and Nizamuddin Railway station was built, abutting the monument. In 1980s, a road was built bifurcating Nila Gumbad from Humayun’s Tomb and later, the structure was occupied by a squatter settlement of over 200 jhuggis. 

To bring back the structure to its lost sheen firstly, the inhabitants of the squatter settlement were relocated in 2004-05 and later in 2014, as per the agreements with the Railways the road bifurcatingthe monument from the Humayun’s Tomb was shifted, so as to allow the access to Nila Gumbad from Humayun’s Tomb.

In a massive exercise in over the last 5years, the landscape setting was restored and an alternate road was built. Also, with the missing of 15000 brick like tiles, the grandeur of the dome was completely lost. To bring back the sheen of the monument, kilns were established at the Humayun’s Tomb complex, youth from Hazrat Nizamuddin basti were employed, and the lost craft tradition was revived. 

The geometric and artistic creations of the ceiling which had been hidden beneath several layers of whitewash and cement through the years were revealed and the missing sandstone lattice screens were also restored. 

A part of land recovered from the Railways was redeveloped in a manner so as to recreate the part of the original garden surrounding the mausoleum. 

Besides this during the conservation work, the archaeological remains of a ramp were also discovered. It is believed that this ramp was used to lift stone and other building material that arrived here on boats - for the construction of Humayun’s Tomb. Over 10 feet of accumulated silt was removed from alongside the eastern wall of the Humayun’s Tomb to restore the levels of the original riverbed. This revealed the northern arcade of Nila Gumbad – which was then reconstructed.    

The conservation work at the mausoleum was done by Aga Khan Trust in partnership with Archaeological Survey of India.

In 2017, Nila Gumbad was declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Monument as part of the extended Humayun’s Tomb World Heritage Site.

                The Minister of State for Culture & Tourism (Independent Charge),Shri Prahlad Singh Patel launched an integrated NOC online Application Processing System for National Monuments Authority (NMA) for 517 local bodies of six states in New Delhi today. This will help in online processing of applications requesting NOC for construction related work in prohibited and regulated area of ASI protected monuments. 



Speaking on the occasion, the Union Culture Minister said that with increase of urbanization, development, growth and increasing population pressure, there is growing pressure on land including the land around centrally protected monuments. As this often affects the monument/site adversely it is important that such growth around the centrally protected monuments is properly regulated, balancing the needs of individuals and growth and development on the one hand and the requirements of preservation and protection of these monuments on the other.



The Minister said that this website will help common people substantially in line with the vision of Prime minister, Shri Narendra Modi regarding Digital India &Ease of Doing Business. Many times people don’t know about the law & they become the victim,this is a great step of NMA andour focus is to bring awareness amongst common man, the Minister added.

Shri Patel said that from today Six New States will be part of this Integrated Online Application Portal with Urban Local Bodies Count. He expressed his gratitude towards six participating States and hoped that other states will also be part of this soon.

The details of States and Urban Local Bodies are as following-


	Madhya Pradesh (378)
	Andhra Pradesh (110)
	Haryana (15)
	Punjab (10)
	Jharkhand (3)
	Telangana (1)


Earlier this system was available only for five urban local bodies of Delhi and one urban local body of Mumbai.

The Portal has integration with the Smart ‘Smarac’ Mobile App of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), through which the applicant traverses his plot and the geo coordinates of his plot along with the images get uploaded into the NIC portal along with the proximity and the approval status.

National Monuments Authority (NMA) under the Ministry of Culture, Govt. of India has been setup as per provisions of “The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010”. In order to automate the process of grant of NO Objection Certificate(NOC) for construction related work in the prohibited and regulated area, NMA had decided to Design, Develop and Implement a web enabled Software (S/w) application named NOC online Application Processing System (NOAPS) and launched it in the public domain over the URL: http://nmanoc.nic.in/ . With the objective of introducing transparency, “NOAPS Non Single window system” was launched on 29th September 2015. Further, “NOAPS Single window system” was officially launched on Ist May 2016.

The applicant needs to fill up a single form which is being sent to the concerned agencies by the Urban Local Body, from whom No Objection Certificate (NOC) is required. NMA on its part will communicate its decision to the local body within 15-30 working days, bringing down the time limit from ninety days, as prescribed in Ancient Monuments and Archeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act.

By this integration, the National Monuments Authority has made a humble effort towards the Mantra of “Reform, Perform and Transform” given by Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Culture and Tourism, Shri Prahlad Singh Patel launched the book ‘the Diary of Manu Gandhi’ (1943-44) at a function in the auditorium of Nehru Memorial Museum and Library today in New Delhi. The book has been brought out by National Archives of India, on the occasion of 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in collaboration with Oxford University Press.



 

Speaking on the occasion Shri Prahlad Singh Patel said that the art of diary writing is height of self discipline of an individual and habit of diary writing converts an ordinary man into extraordinary man. The Minister appreciated efforts of National Archives of India, Dr Tridip Suhrud and Oxford University Press for English translation of the Diary of Manu Gandhi. He said that this translation will help entire world to understand life of Mahatma Gandhi through the Diary of Manu Gandhi. He also urged NIA to translate the Diary of Manu Gandhi into other Indian languages with the help of Sahitya Academy so that the beauty of this book may spread all over the country.

The Diary of Manu Gandhi originally in Gujarati has been edited and translated by Dr Tridip Suhrud, a well known scholar engaged in understanding the Gandhian Intellectual tradition. The first volume covers the period 1943-1944. Manu Gandhi (Mridula) was a grand niece of Mahatma Gandhi, daughter of his Nephew Jaisukhlal Amritlal Gandhi, and stayed with Gandhiji till his assassination. She was an aide to Kasturba Gandhi during her imprisonment in the Aga Khan Palace in 1943.

The first volume of the diary is a record of her life and times with Mahatma Gandhi between 1943-44. Authenticated by Gandhiji himself, the meticulous and intimate entries in the Diary throws light on his life as a prisoner and his endeavour to establish the possibility of collective non-violence. It further chronicles the spiritual and educational pursuits of a woman who takes up writing as a mode of self examination. She shares a moving portrait of Kasturba Gandhi’s illness and death. The author also expresses the deep emotional bond she had developed with Gandhiji.

The National Archives of India is an Attached Office under the Ministry of Culture.  It was established on 11 March 1891 at Kolkata(Calcutta) as the Imperial Record Department.  Following the transfer of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi in 1911, the present building of the National Archives of India was constructed in 1926 which was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The transfer of all records from Calcutta to New Delhi was completed in 1937.

This publication will immensely benefit the scholars interested in Gandhian studies and history of modern India at large.  The book will be another milestone added to the publications that have been brought out by National Archives of India from time to time.

The Department intends to bring out publications out of rich reservoir of both public and private papers collection in order to continue this process.

                The recent excavation carried out by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at Maharashtra’s Phupgaon has revealed evidence of an Iron Age settlement in the Vidarbha region. The excavation at the site was taken up between December, 2018 and March, 2019.

The team of ASI took up an intensive survey in the region between Chandur Bazar to Dariyapur of Purna basin at Phupgaon (N 21° 24’ 00.6” E 77° 54’ 11.6”), Amravati district of Maharashtra. The site is situated in the vast meander of the river Purna, a major tributary of Tapi, which used to be a perennial river, but at present is completely dried-up due to the dam construction in the upper stream. The site is situated about 20 m away from the river bed and its one-third portion has been subjected to frequent erosion during the heavy water current in the earlier times.

A total of 9 trenches were taken for excavations, which brought to light the house remains and other associated features like hearth, post-holes and artefacts.

During the course of excavation, 4 complete circular structures were exposed. All were found encircled with post holes. These structures were found to be enclosed with a circular ditch like feature and postholes. Inside of these structure floor activity, storage bin platforms and hearths were noticed. The bin platforms are circular and they were of different sizes ranging from 90cm to 125cmin diameter.

The excavation also exposed antiquities like beads of agate-carnelian, jasper, quartz and agate were collected in large quantity. Iron, Copper objects have also been collected from all the trenches. Large quantity of graffiti marks had been observed on the potsherds.

The river Purna, a major tributary of the river Tapi, has witnessed several archaeological sites on its either side of the banks. A number of cultural remains in the form of various antiquities and pottery have unraveled the nature of those settlements ranging from Paleolithic to late medieval period.

The excavation is significant as it indicates the presence of sedentary (permanent) settlement, belonging to the Iron Age of Vidarbha.  The settlement comes under the category of a small village with evidence of a small agro-pastoral community with evidences of craftsmanship in the form of beads of agate-carnelian, jasper, quartz and also usage of other artefacts like hopscotch, wheel and barrel shaped beads.  The finding from Phupgaon indicates its contemporaneity with other Iron Age settlements of Vidarbha like Naikund, Mahurjhari, Bhagimori and Thakalkat.

ASI is of the view that the excavation at Phupgaon has provided important insights into Iron Age people of Purna river basin. Chronologically, the site could be placed between 7th C BCE and 4th C BCE. However, further detailed study of the site with chronometric dating is being taken up to reveal further aspects of Iron Age of Vidarbha.

“The convocation ceremony is an acknowledgement of your professional expertise in the field of theatre. Theatre practitioners are the conscience-keepers of the society. My best wishes to the outgoing students,” says Dr. Arjun Deo Charan, Acting Chairman, NSD Society.

About National School of Drama (NSD)

Established in 1959, the National School of Drama is the only one of its kind in India and is an autonomous organization, fully financed by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India. One of the foremost theatre training institution in the world, NSD was established under the aegis of the Sangeet NatakAkademi and became an independent entity in 1975. It offers a 3-year, full-time, residential training program in every aspect of theatre with a special focus on the practical implementation of theories. The enviable list of alumni and faculty members have ensured that the institution remains at the helm of performing arts – several theatre practitioners who passed from the prestigious institution, including playwrights, actors, directors, set and light designers and music directors, have enriched the Indian theatre and continue to do so. Apart from theatre, the artistic manifestations of NSD alumni have often left an indelible mark in other media as well. There are two performing wings of NSD – the Repertory Company and Theatre-in-Education Company (TiE) that started in 1964 and 1989, respectively.

Building on a long history of cooperation, India and Australia have a matured Defence relationship underpinned by the 2006 Memorandum on Defence Cooperation and the 2009 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation. Following the agreement in 2014 of a bilateral Framework for Security Cooperation, the Defence relationship has grown to include a range of forums for strategic dialogue, as well as regular interactions between the Navies through visits of senior officers, Staff Talks and training exchanges. Indian Navy (IN) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) have been regularly interacting to enhance maritime cooperation. The third edition of bilateral naval exercise AUSINDEX conducted in April 2019 in India, witnessed the largest ever participation from both navies. 

Indian Navy and Royal Australian Navy are partners in the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), which is a maritime cooperation construct conceptualised by Indian Navy in 2008. Both the navies are also co-chairs for the IONS Working Group on Information Sharing and Inter-operability, for which the inaugural meeting was hosted by Australia in June 2019.

The visit to New Zealand is aimed to bolster defence cooperation between the two countries. India’s defence relations with New Zealand date back to the days of World War I. Naval cooperation activities between both the nations include port calls by warships, conduct of Passage Exercises and participation in courses conducted at various defence institutes. New Zealand has also been a regular participant of MILAN activities conducted by Indian Navy.

The visit would consolidate existing maritime cooperation initiatives as well as explore new avenues with Australia and New Zealand. During the visit, Admiral Karambir Singh, would also interact with his counter parts in Australia and New Zealand, as well as with other senior Defence and Government officials.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has said, Pakistan has no locus standi in Jammu & Kashmir and it should stop making statements on the internal matters of India. He was addressing farmers, security personnel and scientists after inaugurating the 26th Ladakhi Kisan Jawan Vigyan Mela organised by Defence Institute of High-Altitude Research (DIHAR) at Leh today.

Raksha Mantri said, “I would like to ask Pakistan, when was Kashmir a part of you? Kashmir was always a part of India”.

Shri Rajnath Singh said, our stand on Jammu & Kashmir has always been clear and added that in February 1994, Parliament unanimously passed a resolution on J&K.

Raksha Mantri also said, Pakistan has illegally occupied PoK including Gilgit-Baltistan and instead of speaking on Kashmir it should look into the human rights violations the people are facing in that region.

Shri Rajnath Singh said, by making Ladakh a Union Territory, the government has not only honoured the public sentiment but provided a solution to the people’s problems. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s aim is to bring ‘localised solution’ to the country’s ‘strategic areas’, he added.

Earlier, Raksha Mantri inaugurated ‘Kisan Jawan Vigyan Mela’ in the presence of Chief Executive Counselor, Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Leh, Shri Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, Secretary, Department of Defence R&D & Chairman DRDO, Dr Satheesh Reddy and other senior civilian & Army officials in Ladakh.

Shri Rajnath Singh also visited the experimental farm of DIHAR where technologies for production of quality organic fruits and vegetables are being demonstrated. He inspected the greenhouse technology, soil-less cultivation technology, potato storage technology and growing melons under cold climatic conditions.

Raksha Mantri said, the mela provides a platform for interaction between farmers, soldiers and scientists, perfectly imbibing the concept of ‘Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan-Jai Vigyan-Jai Anusandhan’. Appreciating the important role played by DIHAR in connecting the soldiers and the society in Ladakh region, he said the mela is a big leap towards strengthening the strategic ecosystem of Ladakh.

Shri Rajnath Singh called upon the scientists at DIHAR to develop, within three years when it completes 60 years of its establishment, a model on ‘High Altitude Survival’ that can help the Armed Forces personnel to brave the harsh and inhospitable conditions and keep their morale high. The Indian Army has the capability to become the best ‘High Altitude Warfare’ force in the world, he added.

Raksha Mantri also appreciated the recent initiative of LAHDC to turn Leh into a certified organic district by 2025. He assured support from the Government in its organic mission.

DIHAR was established in 1962 to meet the fresh food requirement of the soldiers deployed in the harsh terrain of Ladakh. Through the technologies developed by the institute, the Army is getting locally grown fresh organic farm produce. As a spin-off of the technologies developed, farmers in Ladakh are able to produce a variety of fruits and vegetables resulting in improving their socio-economic condition.

                A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Indian Navy (IN) and India Meteorological Department (IMD) was signed at Naval Base, Kochi on 28 Aug 19 for the handing over of Cyclone Detection Radar (CDR) building by IMD to the IN. Rear Admiral RJ Nadkarni, AVSM, VSM, Chief of Staff, Southern Naval Command (SNC) and Dr D Pradhan, Scientist ‘G’, Additional Director General of Meteorology (Instruments), IMD, Delhi signed the MoU on behalf of IMD and IN respectively. The MoU will enable the IN to utilise the CDR building within naval premises at Kochi for meteorological purposes.



The CDR building was constructed during the period 1983–86 inside the Naval Base, having an S-band Cyclone Detection Radar installed by M/s Bharat Electronics Limited. The facility was operated by IMD from 1987-2017 to provide weather support for civil aviation at the old Kochi Airport – presently the Naval Air Station INS Garuda. In 2017, IMD commenced operating a new Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) at Mundamveli, Kochi as the S-band radar had become obsolete. The CDR building had been lying vacant and unused since then. Based on a request by the IN, IMD has agreed to hand over the building permanently for meteorological purposes. 

 

The keys of the building were handed over by Dr Pradhan to Commodore Deepak Kumar, Chief Staff Officer (Operations), SNC in the presence of Commodore Manoj Kumar Singh, Commodore (Naval Oceanology and Meteorology), Naval Headquarters, New Delhi. The building is set to be utilised by Indian Naval Meteorological Analysis Centre (INMAC), an operational unit set up in 2013 with the mandate to provide daily meteorological information/ forecasts to users across the Navy such as IN ships and establishments.

                Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa, PVSM, AVSM, YSM, VM, ADC, Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee and Chief of the Air Staff is embarking on a three day visit to Thailand from 26 to 28 Aug 19. He would be attending the 2019 Indo Pacific Chiefs of Defence (CHOD) Conference in Bangkok. The theme for the conference is “Collaboration in a free and Open Indo – Pacific”. The conference will provide perspectives on common challenges faced by attending nations and elicit open discussions on the same. The Chiefs of Defence of more than 33 countries are scheduled to attend the Conference.

Bilateral defence relations between India and Thailand have gained momentum consequent to India’s ‘’Look/ Act East Policy’ along with overall improvement in relations at political, economic and cultural levels. Joint Working Group on Security Cooperation, initiated in May 2003, had nominated Military Cooperation as one of the seven primary areas of focus to strengthen cooperation. This was re-enforced in the joint statement issued during Thai Prime Minister’s official visit to India in Jan 2012. India and Thailand have commemorated the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 2017. Such visits and cooperation will contribute, in the medium and long term, towards India being a natural partner of Thailand for regional collaborative security initiatives.

The participation of the Indian Chairman COSC would provide further impetus towards increasing defence cooperation with Thailand and pave the way for greater interaction and cooperation in future.

                Continuing the process of dialogue which had started from 14 August 2019, the fourth meeting was held yesterday with the office bearers of AIDEF, INDWF, BPMS and CDRA under the Chairmanship of Secretary, DDP.  While reaffirming that the proposed corporatisation of OFB is under examination of the Government, Secretary, DDP patiently listened to the concerns expressed by the Employees Federations regarding how the benefits/interests of employees in terms of wages, health facilities and other service matters may be affected due to corporatisation of OFB.  The Employees Federations inter-alia suggested that their views should be considered while preparing the roadmap for increasing the turnover of the proposed entity from the current levels.  After detailed deliberations, it was agreed to recommend to the Government, the setting up of a High Level Official Committee to interact with Employees Federations to examine their concerns and other aspects of the proposed new entity.  The Federations on their part have agreed to withdraw the ongoing strike and continue with the process of dialogue.  With this, employees will now be resuming their duties with effect from Monday, 26th August, 2019.

                The delegation of enhanced financial powers by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to the Services has led to a significant increase in both value and number of cases processed at the Service HQ, command and lower formation levels across the three Services. 

From the data provided by the SHQs regarding the impact of delegation of powers, it is observed that there has been a clear surge in the cases being finalised at the level of SHQ and other formations leading to a decrease in the time taken to finalise the procurement cases. This has resulted in the optimal use of the budgets allocated to the MoD.

During the period 2016-18, the Defence Services were progressively delegated higher financial powers for both routine as well as emergency procurements with the aim to reduce procurement time-frames and enhance defence preparedness.

On the capital side, the Services now have powers to accord Acceptance of Necessity (AoNs) for individual schemes costing up to Rs 300 crores, a sharp jump in two stages from Rs 50 crores during 2015-17 to Rs 150 crores during 2017-19 and to Rs 300 crores in 2019-20. On the revenue side, the Services are now authorized to clear proposals amounting up to Rs 500 crores at their level. This dispensation came about in October, 2018 and replaced the earlier limited delegation of Rs 200 crores. 

The MoD undertook a review in July, 2019 to assess the impact of higher delegation of financial powers to the Defence Services. The review concluded the following: 


	With regard to the Army, as against a total of 327 cases referred to MoD for the grant of AoN between April 2012 to 31st March, 2015 only 132 cases were referred during 2015-17.
	Similarly, during FY 2016-17 and up to 31st December 2018, there was a steady decline in AoNs accorded and contracts concluded by the Navy with MoD approval and corresponding increase in the number of AoNs accorded and contracts concluded under financial powers of the NHQ.
	As far as the Air Force is concerned, around 80 – 85 per cent of the contracted value is now sanctioned at the Air HQ itself.
	The value of AoNs accorded and contracts concluded under delegated financial powers of Commands and lower formations has also increased steadily during the period.
	On Capital side, the AoNs by SHQ have gone up substantially from 21 per cent in 2015-17 to 67 per cent in 2019.

                A historic milestone was reached with the signing of an MoU between Indian Army and Tata Realty & Housing on 22 Aug 2019.           

The MoU enables the personnel of Indian Army to immediately take over  dwelling units in 13 ‘Ready to Move in’ projects of Tata Realty pan India spread over 10 cities including Gurugram, Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune among others at a discount ranging from 11% to 27%. 

          This also heralds a new era for Army Welfare Housing Organization (AWHO), which has always endeavored to provide quality housing for Army personnel who are deployed in remote locations across the country. AWHO will now facilitate acquisition of homes from reputed private builders at discounted rather than building them for the soldiers.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has approved certain decisions regarding re-organisation of Army Headquarters. The approval has been given based on a detailed internal study conducted by the Army Headquarters. The decisions are as follows:


	A separate Vigilance Cell under COAS with Tri-Services representation - Presently, the vigilance function for the COAS is through multiple agencies and there is no single point interface. An independent vigilance cell will be made functional under COAS. Accordingly, ADG (Vigilance) will be placed directly under the COAS for this purpose. It will have three Colonel-level officers (one each from Indian Army, Indian Air Force and Indian Navy). This will be done within the existing posts at AHQ.
	An umbrella organisation under VCOAS for enhanced focus on human rights issues - To give high priority to observance of human rights convention and values, it has been decided to set up a special Human Rights Section headed by ADG (Major General rank officer) directly under the VCOAS. It will be the nodal point to examine any HR violation reports. To enhance transparency and ensure the best of investigative expertise is available to the section, a Police officer of SSP/SP rank will be taken on deputation. 
	Re-location of 206 Army Officers from AHQ to Formations/Units of the Field Army - A total of 206 officers will be optimized from AHQ and these officers will be made available additionally to Formations/Units of the Field Army, as per details given below:

                The Indian Coast Guard held a High-Level Meeting (HLM) with the Sri Lanka Coast Guard at Coast Guard Headquarters here today. The Indian side was led by Director General, Coast Guard K Natarajan, while the Sri Lankan delegation was headed by Rear Admiral Samantha Wimalathunge.

During the meeting, both sides agreed to strengthen co-operation in addressing a spectrum of maritime issues concerning safety and security.

The apprehension of two fishing boats by Sri Lanka involved in drug trafficking based on the information exchange undertaken by Indian Coast Guard invoking the MoU was recognised as an important enabler for pursuing further collaborative response to emerging situations at sea. Continued capacity building of Sri Lanka Coast Guard by Indian Coast Guard, training of Sri Lanka Coast Guard personnel and mutual co-operation in multilateral forums was discussed and agreed by both sides.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh today emphasised the need to progressively reduce dependence on foreign manufacturers and indigenously develop comprehensive capabilities in the defence sector. Delivering the inaugural address at the seminar on 'Modernisation and Indigenisation plans of the Indian Air Force' in New Delhi, Shri Rajnath Singh urged the private industry to take advantage of the policy initiatives of the Government and engage with defence services, Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) and Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) for meeting their indigenisation demands. He reiterated the government’s commitment to resolving any outstanding issue in the way of growth and development of Indigenous Industries in defence sector. He asked the industry not to expect any short-term returns but invest for long term gains.

Raksha Mantri described Indian Air Force as a technologically advanced and extremely potent force saying that the recent offensive against terror outfits in our neighbourhood speaks volumes about the reach and lethality of the formidable arm of the Armed Forces. Indian Air Force, besides Army and Navy, needs to keep pace with the advancements in technology for enhancing operational capabilities, he added.

Recalling Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s call to modernise our Armed Forces, Shri Rajnath Singh said efforts are being made to increase the participation of the private sector in ‘Make in India’ in defence sector.

Listing out the Government’s initiatives to promote ‘Make in India’, Raksha Mantri said foreign investment up to 49 per cent was allowed through automatic route and up to 100 per cent under Government route on case-to-case basis. He urged foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to establish manufacturing facilities in India adding that a number of opportunities are available to foreign companies through FDI, Joint Ventures or the defence offset route. Shri Rajnath Singh also said the process of defence offset implementation has been streamlined and one of the major demands of the industry to reinstate the provision of services for discharge of offsets has now been provided.

Shri Rajnath Singh announced approval for use of test facilities of government entities for the private industry to meet the best quality standards required for defence manufacturing. He said the decision to this effect has been taken after incorporating the comments of the stakeholders particularly indigenous defence manufacturers. Shri Rajnath Singh expressed hope that the synergy between government’s efforts and industry participation will help fulfil the long-cherished dream of making India a frontrunner in defence production.

Raksha Mantri added that comprehensive outsourcing and vendor development guidelines for DPSUs and OFB to promote participation of private sector, particularly MSMEs in defence production. He said indigenisation requirements of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), OFB, DPSUs, Army, Air Force and Navy have also been hosted on Ministry of Defence (MoD) website for the benefit of the private industry.

Raksha Mantri said the defence products list for issuing industrial licenses under Industry Development and Regulation (IDR) Act has been revised adding that it has reduced the entry barriers for the industry especially the small and medium segment. The initial validity of Industrial license has been increased from three years to fifteen years with a provision to further extend it by three years on a case-to-case basis, he added.

Shri Rajnath Singh also referred to the Technology Development Fund (TDF) Scheme which has been established under the aegis of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to promote self-reliance in Defence Technology as part of ‘Make in India’ initiative. He said the scheme will encourage participation of public/private industries especially MSMEs so as to create an ecosystem for enhancing cutting edge technology capability for defence application.

In his keynote address, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa pitched for inhouse manufacturing of defence equipment and called for finetuning the capabilities to meet the requirements. He said there is a need to replace obsolete war-fighting equipment with indigenous technology and bridge technological gaps in the defence sector. The Air Force is always alert on the border irrespective if there is any movement or not, he added.

Two books on indigenisation efforts of defence equipment were also released on the occasion.

Air Officer-in charge Maintenance Air Marshal S. Chaoudhary, Principal Adviser (Defence), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Lt. Gen. JP Nehra (Retd.), Member, Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM) and Chairman CII (Northern Region) Satish Kumar Kaura, delegates of the industry and Armed Forces personnel were also present.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh today visited the Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC) and Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) located at Gurugram. He reviewed the functioning of IMAC and IFC-IOR. Senior Navy officials, including the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh, briefed him on further enhancing the capabilities of the two centres under the National Maritime Domain Awareness (NMDA) Project.

The NMDA project was launched in accordance with the vision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on SAGAR (Security And Growth for All in the Region). The IMAC monitors movement of more than 120,000 ships a year passing through the Indian Ocean. The cargo carried by these ships account for 66 per cent of world crude oil, 50 per cent of container traffic and 33 per cent of bulk cargo. Thus, IMAC performs a very crucial role in collecting shipping information, analysing traffic patterns and sharing the inputs with the user agencies.

Raksha Mantri was also briefed on the IFC-IOR, which is a collaborative initiative by the Indian Navy in coordination with partner nations and multi-national maritime agencies to enhance Maritime Domain Awareness and Maritime Security. The Centre is likely to host International Liaison Officers from the partner nations in the near future.

                In continuation of the Indian Navy’s overseas deployment to Africa, Europe and Russia, Indian Naval Ship Tarkash made a port call at Cadiz, Spain today, on 19 Aug 19 for a three days visit. The port call by INS Tarkash at Cadiz is a demonstration of India’s warm ties with Spain and its commitment to enhance operational reach, maritime security and its solidarity with friendly nations. INS Tarkash had participated in bilateral exercise KONKAN-19 with Royal Navy ship HMS Defender prior entering Cadiz harbour.

 

INS Tarkash commanded by Captain Sathish Vasudev, is a state of the art warship of the Indian Navy equipped with a versatile range of weapons and sensors capable of addressing threats in all the three dimensions. The ship is part of the Indian Navy’s Western Fleet and is under the operational Command of Flag Officer Commanding–in–Chief, Western Naval Command, based at Mumbai.

 

During the port call, various dignitaries and government officials of Spain are scheduled to visit the ship. The ship will also engage extensively with the Spanish Navy during its stay in the harbour. Apart from professional interactions, a number of sports and social engagements are planned, which would go a long way in enhancing cooperation and understanding between the two navies. 

 

Spain and India have traditionally enjoyed warm and friendly relations. A number of bilateral arrangements for defence co-operation and cultural exchange exist between the two countries. The professional and cultural bonds developed through regular visits and interactions strengthens the established mechanisms of maritime cooperation between Indian Navy and Spanish Navy while pursuing common goals of keeping the seas safe and secure.

 

Indian Navy ships are regularly deployed as part of Indian Navy’s mission of building ‘bridges of friendship’ and strengthening international ties. The ship visit to Spain comes amidst growing importance and convergence of national goals towards shared maritime interest and deepening of ties between both the countries.

	Simplify policy and procedures to facilitate greater participation of Indian Industry and develop robust Defence Industrial base.
	Wherever applicable, examine and incorporate new concepts, such as life cycle costing, life cycle support, performance based logistics, ICT, lease contracting, codification & standardisation.
	Include provisions to promote Indian start-ups and research & development.
	Any other aspect which will contribute towards refining the acquisition process and support the ‘Make in India’ initiative.


The Committee has been given six months to submit its recommendations.

                In continuation of the meeting held on August 14, a Committee of senior officials of Ministry of Defenceled by Additional Secretary, Department of Defence Production alongwith Chairman, Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) once again met the office bearers of the All India Defence Employees Federation, Indian National Defence Workers Federation, Bhartiya Pratiksha Mazdoor Sangh and Confederation of Defence Recognized Association here today on the issue  of Strike notice  given by them starting with effect from August  20, 2019.  The meeting was also attended by officials from the Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India.

The Committee also pointed out that the employees’ call for 30 days’ strike was unprecedented, especially when Government has already agreed to their demand to hold discussions at the MoD level and is in process of continuously engaging with them. 

The Committee explained to the employee organisations that there is no proposal to privatise OFB.The proposal under consideration of Government is to make it into Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), which is 100 per cent Government owned.  Rumours being spread that OFB is being privatised are misguiding and with the intent to mislead the workers. Corporatisation of OFB will bring OFB at par with other DPSUs of MoD.  This is in the interest of OFB as it will provide operational freedom and flexibility to OFB which it presently lacks.  Besides, the interests of the workers will be adequately safeguarded in any decision taken on the subject. 

The Committee also pointed out that Government has been continuously trying to strengthen the functioning of OFB, including having taken several steps to modernise the factories, carry out capital upgradation, re-train and re-skill OFB employees at Government costs, enable development of products and components with indigenous technology.The Committee urged the employee organisations to recognise Government’s efforts to make OFB into a competitive, productive and efficient organisation with higher turnover and enhanced profitability, which would also be in the interest of the employees.  Therefore, the Committee once again urged the employee organisations to withdraw their proposed strike.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh today visited Pokhran in Rajasthan where India had conducted nuclear tests in 1998 under the leadership of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and paid homage to him on his first death anniversary. In a series of tweets, Shri Rajnath Singh described Atal ji as one of the stalwarts of Independent India and added that it is his good fortune that he has got this opportunity to pay deepest respects to the former Prime Minister at Pokhran.

Raksha Mantri said, “Pokhran is the area which witnessed Atal ji’s firm resolve to make India a nuclear power and yet remain firmly committed to the doctrine of ‘No First Use’. India has strictly adhered to this doctrine. What happens in future depends on the circumstances.”

Shri Rajnath Singh said India attaining the status of a responsible nuclear nation is a matter of national pride for every citizen of the country and the nation will remain indebted to the greatness of Atal ji.

The country will be celebrating 73rd Independence Day tomorrow. On this solemn occasion, I extend my heartiest greetings and best wishes to each one of you serving in the Armed Forces. I extend my greetings to all serving personnel as well as ex-servicemen of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Coast Guard. I also extend my best wishes to the family members of our personnel, many of whom are deployed far away from their homes in mountains, jungles, deserts and even deep seas serving the county day-in, day-out. 

            On this auspicious occasion, my thoughts and gratitude are with the near and dear ones of all those who had laid down their lives in the line of duty. We are forever indebted to them for their supreme sacrifice. 

There had been continuous demands for a separate war memorial since Independence for those who made supreme sacrifice for the country. However, due to some reason or the other the plan to construct the memorial got delayed. When our government under the able leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi came into power five years ago, our government took up the project. Eventually a befitting National War Memorial for our martyrs came up in the heart of the National Capital. It was dedicated by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on February 25. 

            Friends, this year we are commemorating 20 years of Kargil War. The Prime Minister while paying homage to the Martyrs said that every Indian was remembering the inspirational saga of our brave hearts for their valour and dedication to the nation. We ‘remember’ our martyrs by revisiting their sacrifices, we ‘rejoice’ by celebrating the victory in Kargil and we ‘renew’ our resolve to safeguard the honour of the Tricolour. 

            Our neighbouring country is continuously keeping a sinister eye on Jammu and Kashmir. It sends terrorists into our territory and disturbs peace in the Valley. On 14 February 2019, 40 brave jawans of CRPF were martyred in Pulwama in a suicide attack. Our Armed Forces hit back by destroying the terror launch pads with air strikes across the border in Pakistan before it could plan another Pulwama like attack. 

            In the new and emerging world, the battlefield is not only limited to land, air and sea but will also spread to space and cyber space. Therefore, India has to be ready for any eventuality keeping pace with technological advancements in the area. Keeping this in mind, we successfully conducted an Anti-Satellite missile test ‘Mission Shakti’ on March 27 this year. The DRDO-developed Ballistic Missile Defence Interceptor Missile successfully engaged an Indian orbiting target satellite in Low Earth Orbit in a ‘Hit to Kill’ mode. With this, India joined a select group of nations, like USA, Russia and China which possess such a capability. However, let me reiterate that defence policy of the country is for peace and stability at regional, continental and global level. 

            Since the Armed Forces are at the forefront of our nation’s defence, I assure you that the Government will do all that is necessary to keep your morale high and to meet your functional requirements. Under the able leadership of the Prime Minister, the Armed Forces are being rapidly modernised. We are working tirelessly to achieve his vision of ‘jointness’ among the three wings of the Armed Forces. 

            My Dear Sainik Brothers and Sisters, additionally, efforts are being made to increase the participation of private sector in defence manufacturing under ‘Make in India’ to boost indigenisation. The 11th DefExpo India- 2020 is scheduled to be held in Lucknow which will offer an excellent opportunity for the Indian defence industry to showcase its capabilities and promote its export potential. 

            The Army recently carried out summer user trials of third Generation Anti-Tank Guided Missile NAG successfully at Pokhran Field Firing Ranges. This third-generation fire and forget class missile has been developed to engage highly fortified enemy tanks in all weather conditions with day and night capabilities. The robust imaging algorithm has made the missile hit the target at four-kilometre distance even in severe summer desert conditions which is unique in its class. 

            The Indian Air Force successfully fired the BrahMos air version missile from its frontline Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft in May 2019. A 500 kg class Inertial Guided Bomb was successfully flight tested in May 2019 again from Sukhoi-30. The guided bomb achieved the desired range and hit the target with high precision. The LCA Tejas made successful trial of mid-air refuelling on September 10 which is a major step towards final operational clearance. 

            My Dear Sainik Brothers and Sisters, we have now delegated greater financial powers to Vice Chiefs of the three Services in order to expedite the decision-making process involved in the revenue procurements. With the new delegation, the financial powers of the Vice Chiefs are increased from Rs 100 crore to Rs 500 crore. It will augment the arms and ammunition reserves of the Armed Forces. 

            My dear jawans, I have restored ‘ration in kind’ for the officers of the three-Armed Forces posted in peace areas since June. Now, all officers of the Armed Forces, including those in peace station will be getting ration. It may be noted that all the jawans are already availing it in all stations.  

            The government recently enhanced scholarship for the wards of Martyrs. A Janaushadhi Kendra was inaugurated at Base Hospital, Delhi Cantt in March this year. This pilot Kendra, which is in line with Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana, will benefit in the provisioning of medicines at much cheaper rate compare to market. It will later be replicated in other parts of the country. We have also opened first Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) Polyclinic at Tawang and Tenga in Arunachal Pradesh in October last year. 

             Our Armed Forces, including the Coast Guard have always played a key role in giving succour to the people in the times of disaster. It was no different this time, whether it was during Cyclone FANI, Gaja or Ockhi. Our officers and jawans worked tirelessly to bring smiles on the faces of sufferers. 

            My Dear Sainik Brothers and Sisters, with these words, I once again extend my greetings to all of you and your family members on the eve of 73rdIndependence Day. Our freedom fighters fought hard against the Colonial rule so that we could live in a free India. The proud nation now looks up to you to defend its borders with best of your strength & abilities. 

             With these words, I once again wish you all very happy Independence Day. 

            Jai Hind!

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh honoured the winners of the online quiz competition on Kargil War, here today. The quiz was jointly organised by Ministry of Defence and MyGov.in from July 26 - August 4, 2019 on the occasion of 20th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas with the aim to create awareness and patriotic fervour among the people mostly youth.

Sixty thousand people from across the country participated in the quiz. Cash prizes have been given to the top 10 winners, while 100 others received certificates from Raksha Mantri. The youngest winner is a 16-year old student, while the oldest is a retired bank employee aged 63 years.

The winners will attend the Independence Day Flag Hoisting Ceremony at Red Fort tomorrow.

Raksha Mantri congratulated the winners and appreciated their knowledge of the Kargil War. He said the whole country was behind our Armed Forces who secured a resounding victory for the nation. He said the country is safe because of the strength and valour of our Armed Forces and the sacrifices made by them.

Shri Rajnath Singh said there has been unease in Pakistan following the recent government decision to nullify Article 370 and create Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. However, the neighbouring country has no courage to take on us because it is very well aware of the strength and capabilities of the Indian Armed Forces, he added.

During the campaign the unit was awarded with three Mahavir Chakras and two Vir Chakras.  The unit was also honoured with the Battle Honour Darsana and the Theatre Honour East Pakistan for its outstanding performance. The Battalion has participated in major operations by Indian Army to include ‘Operation Pawan’ in Sri Lanka in 1989, ‘Operation Rakshak’ in J & K and ‘Operation Rhino’ in Assam. 

The Battalion also had a prestigious opportunity to serve in the United Nations Mission in Sudan from 2008 to 2009.  Fifth battalion of the first Gorkha Rifles is a highly decorated battalion having recipients of three Mahavir Chakras, two Kirti Chakras, six Vir Chakras, two Shaurya Chakras and 32 Sena Medals.

            The sailor was deployed for Op Rakshak, J&K, since May 18. In two, back to back operations, Op Danna & Shok Baba where eight foreign terrorists were eliminated, the sailor had performed exceptionally well. In Op Danna, he as buddy of Lt Cdr Mahesh Kumar, shot dead one terrorist at extreme close quarters whilst giving cover to the Officer, who shot dead another terrorist. On 20-21 Sep he was involved in Op Shok Baba alongwith 14 RR in a Cordon and Search Operation, where 5-6 terrorists were entrapped in a house at village Shok Baba. Despite firing heavy calibre weapons and grenades, the terrorists remained protected in the mud house/ cow shed. At this juncture, AS Rana and team volunteered to approach the cow shed with a heavy IED to destroy it. As a heavy volume of fire was unleashed by the balance MARCOS, the brave soldier quickly manoeuvred and placed the IED at the cow shed. Whilst manoeuvring in, he was fired upon but came out unscathed backed by close in cover fire by his buddy. The cow shed was blown up by the IED and three terrorists inside were eliminated. 

            During deployment for OP Raksak in J&K, the sailor had participated in multiple operations. During two such operations viz. OP Shok Baba and OP Danna, he displayed exemplary courage, tactical acumen and gallantry of very high order and played a vital role in neutralising the terrorists. The sailor was instrumental in placing demolition charges under heavy fire from the terrorists which led to their successful elimination. Further, he played a vital role in engaging terrorists at close range and kept them pinned down to allow the operation to progress further. Indian Army has commended his role during both operations. For his selfless actions in dire circumstances, Amit Singh Rana, LME, 231243-N is recommended for the award of “Shaurya Chakra”.

            The sailor was part of the team that eliminated five hardcore foreign terrorists as a part of ‘OP Shok Baba’ on 20-21 Sep 18 in a Cordon and Search Operation where 5-6 terrorists were entrapped in a house at village Shok Baba. The MARCOS were deployed in the inner cordon at a radius of barely 20m around the target house. The team was tasked with placement and activation of IEDs to demolish the target house in order to eliminate the terrorists holed up inside. On approach of the demolition team, one of the injured terrorists fired onto the demolition in-charge. The sailor, with utter disregard to his personal safety, stepped ahead and fired onto the terrorist, thereby pinning him down and averting fire on to his buddy. During OP Shok Baba, when the terrorists protected themselves in cowshed, the sailor alongwith 03 buddies, approached the target area using BP Shields as cover.

Military aircraft would use the CIAL runway for take off and landing and the NAE taxy track for proceeding to and from the dispersal / hangar.

                           The Memorandum of Understanding lays down Standard Operating Procedures and their adherence by CIAL and the Indian Navy, for ensuring safe, secure and uninterrupted military air operations. Senior management functionaries of CIAL including Shri AM Shabeer, Executive Director, Shri Sunil Chacko, Chief Financial Officer and Shri Dinesh Kumar C, Head of Operations were present for the function.

                           Naval Air Enclave is capable of supporting operations of the highly capable P8I Long Range Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft, which was extensively used to coordinate Search and Rescue Operations off the coast of Kerala and the Lakshadweep Islands in Dec 2017, following Cyclone Ockhi. The optimal exploitation of the NAE would significantly enhance the maritime reconnaissance capability of Southern Naval Command, as also the Indian Navy.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has approved extension of benefits of Child Care Leave (CCL) to single male service personnel and certain relaxations of CCL provisions in case of woman officers of defence forces, in line with a recent DoPT order extending similar benefits of CCL to civilian employees.

Presently, CCL is being granted to woman officers in defence forces. Recently, DoPT has made certain amendments for grant of CCL to civilian employees, whereby the CCL granted to woman employees till now has been extended to single male government servants also. The age limit of 22 years prescribed earlier in the case of a child with 40 percent disability has been removed for the purpose of availing CCL. Further, the minimum period of CCL that can be availed at a time has been reduced to 05 days instead of 15 days.

Now the proposal of Ministry of Defence extending similar benefits to Defence personnel has been approved by Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh. With this, single male service personnel will be able to avail the benefit of CCL. Single male service personnel and woman officers of defence forces will also be able to avail CCL in respect of child with 40 percent disability without any restriction of age limit of the child. Further, the minimum period of CCL that can be availed in each spell has been reduced to 05 days from the earlier limit of 15 days.

                Indian Naval Ship Tarkash, a front-line warship of the Indian Navy, entered the port of Bergen, Norway, today, on 09 Aug 19 for a three day visit as part of Western Fleet Overseas Deployment 01/ 2019. The ship is part of the Indian Navy's Western Fleet and is under the operational Command of Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief/ Western Naval Command, based at Mumbai. The port call by Tarkash at Bergen is a demonstration of India's warm ties with Norway. INS Tarkash, commanded by Captain Sathish Vasudev, is one of the most potent frontline frigates of the Indian Navy equipped with a versatile range of weapons and sensors.

During the port call, various dignitaries and government officials of Norway are scheduled to visit the ship. Professional interactions are planned with the Royal Norwegian Navy and Coast Guard towards further enhancing co-operation between the two countries. In addition to social engagements and sports event, best practices will also be shared between the Indian and Royal Norwegian Navies.

India has cordial and friendly relations since 1947 with Norway. Bilateral cooperation between the two countries is progressed through the India-Norway Joint Commission Meetings. The inaugural 'Bilateral Discussion' between the Royal Norwegian Navy and IN was held in February 2017 at New Delhi.

  Indian Navy ships are regularly deployed as part of Indian Navy's mission of building 'bridges of friendship' and strengthening international cooperation with friendly countries. The ship visit to Norway comes amidst growing importance and convergence of national goals towards shared maritime interest and deepening of ties between both the countries.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has voiced government’s desire to encourage private industry investment in defence sector while also strengthening defence PSUs and Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). Addressing CEOs of top Defence and Aerospace companies at a roundtable with the theme ‘Make in India in Defence Industry’ here today, Shri Rajnath Singh said defence companies have huge opportunities in contributing to domestic market in addition to exports.

Raksha Mantri said the strategic partnership model has been notified to establish defence manufacturing infrastructure and supply chain through which Indian companies could choose a partner through a competitive and transparent process. He added that FDI policy in defence sector has been liberalised. 

Regarding the offset processing, Shri Rajnath Singh said the Ministry has set up an end-to-end offset processing portal through which proposals of value USD 1.5 billion were processed. Entry barriers for MSMEs were also reduced and this resulted in doubling of defence licenses issued from 215 in 2014 to 440 in 2019. 

Raksha Mantri said the Defence Investor Cell established a year ago in the Ministry has processed nearly 550 queries and grievances.

While highlighting various measures initiated by the government to encourage defence exports, Shri Rajnath Singh urged the industry to work towards increasing exports to friendly countries. He said export procedure has been simplified and defence procurement procedure was revised in 2016 to encourage indigenous design, development and manufacture. 

Raksha Mantri said self reliance in defence sector would not be possible without development of indigenous technology and called for steps to develop related technologies within the country. He said there is greater possibility now because the contribution of digital technologies in defence sector is on the upswing and India has strong capabilities to develop such technologies where startups have a significant role to play.  

Shri Rajnath Singh said the Indian defence industry’s production was Rs 80,000 crore in 2018-19 of which Rs 16,000 crore was the contribution from the private sector.

Raksha Mantri said our nation is confidently scaling new heights based on strong political leadership strengthened by strategic economy. He called for a multi-pronged approach to achieve the aim of ‘Make in India’.

Earlier, in his welcome address, Secretary (Defence Production) Dr. Ajay Kumar said the roundtable has been organised to obtain views and suggestions from the industry to further improve the systems and procedures in the defence sector.

Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Yesso Naik, senior officials of the Ministry, Defence PSUs, OFB and CEOs & representatives of top Defence manufacturing companies were present on the occasion.

                With the objective to promote ‘Make in India’ in Defence sector, Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh will interact with top Defence and Aerospace Industry leaders at Vigyan Bhawan Annexe, here tomorrow. ‘Make in India in Defence Industry Roundtable’ is organised by Department of Defence Production, Ministry of Defence (MoD). It aims to explore ways to attract investment, address the concerns of the industry and promote innovations in Defence sector.

The MoD has taken several steps to ease licensing, promote exports and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the Defence sector.

The process of acquiring defence industrial licence has been eased to significantly enhance ‘Ease of Doing Defence Business’. Applications have been received from various companies and 63 of them were disposed off within the time-frame in 2018-19.

To promote defence exports, 668 No Objection Certificates were issued to companies during 2018-19. Steps have been taken to rationalise the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for reducing the time taken for granting permission for exports. The average time taken has reduced by 100 per cent to 32 days now. Defence exports have recorded a substantial rise to Rs 10,745 crore in 2018-19 from Rs 4,682 crore in 2017-18.

FDI in Defence and Aerospace in the last five years was Rs 1,664 crore. Before 2014, the figure was Rs 1,321 crore.

‘Make in India’ portal for Defence Production has been revamped and re-launched. A new portal, www.defenceexim.gov.in has been created for end-to-end processing and communication of export license applications and generating and disseminating export market leads.

In addition, the MoD launched a dashboard to keep track of the major components of Defence Production, including defence exports, defence offsets, defence projects under ‘Make in India’, startups in defence sector, investments in defence corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and artificial intelligence projects in defence.

The interaction of industry leaders with Raksha Mantri will provide an opportunity to discuss new and innovative proposals in defence production and exports.

                Indian Army team has secured the first position followed by Kazakhstan & Russian Army teams in Stage 1 of the ongoing International Army Scout Masters Competition being held at Jaisalmer Military Station under aegis of Southern Command of Indian Army. A total of seven teams from friendly foreign countries viz Armenia, Belarus, China, Uzbekistan, Russia, Sudan, Kazakhstan are participating in the Fifth Edition of Army International Scout Masters competition being held for the first time in India from 05 to 16 August 2019. Indian Army is participating in the competition for the first time as hosts and their stupendous performance in Stage 1 is a true reflection of the highest standards of physical fitness, training and professionalism of the Indian Army.

The first stage of the Army International Scout Masters Competition involved infiltration behind enemy lines and link-up with an intelligence source, carrying out visual surveillance of a known enemy Electronic Warfare post and targeting of an enemy vehicle convoy. A navigation march of approximate 15 Kilometers on foot by night, without electronic navigation aids, was also undertaken by the teams. The first stage not only put to test the team’s battle drills and survival skills but also gauged their professional acumen of undertaking conventional navigation utilising rudime ntary maps and compass in the harsh desert terrain.

                Incessant rains have resulted in widespread floods in Northern Karnataka and Southern Maharashtra, with Belgaum, Bagalkot and Raichur in Karnataka and Kolhapur, Sangli and Raigarh in Maharashtra being the worst affected districts. Normal life in these areas has been thrown out of gear. On request of civil administration, Armed Forces swiftly reacted to the situation. Air force aircrafts like IL-76, An-32 and Avro were used for airlift of Army / Naval rescue teams / NDRF. Army columns including Engineer Task Forces alongwith boats and flood rescue equipment were deployed in affected areas. Naval rescue teams with boats and specialist divers were deployed inland for rescue operations alongwith Coast Guard.

Over 1000 personnel from Armed Forces alongwith boats and other specialised flood relief equipment have been deployed in Karnataka alongwith two helicopters with winching capability.   About 400 personnel alongwith four helicopters have been deployed in Maharashtra for rescue operations.

In addition to the above, approx. 10 aircrafts are being used to airlift NDRF teams and Engineer Task Forces to the affected areas. The speed of operations has been hindered by inclement weather, which severely restricted air operations, especially helicopter flying. Headquarters Southern Command at Pune has been nominated as the Nodal agency for coordination of relief operations in concert with the respective State Governments.

Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff has established an overall Command & Control Centre at Delhi to receive demands and process allocations of resources from the three Services. Coordination with Central Government is being done 24 x 7.

                To give a boost to indigenisation, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh,accorded approval for procurement of indigenous Software Defined Radio (SDRTactical) and Next Generation Maritime Mobile Coastal Batteries (Long Range) for the Indian Navyhere today.

The SDR is a complex and state of art communication system, which has been indigenously designed and developed by DRDO, BEL and Weapons Electronics System Engineering Establishment (WESEE). It would enable information sharing, collaboration and situational awareness through high-speed data and secure voice communication with anti-jamming capability.

Next Generation Maritime Mobile Coastal Batteries (NGMMCB, LongRange) would be fitted with supersonic BrahMos surface-to-surface cruise missiles and would be deployed along the coast.  The NGMMCB has been developed and manufactured in India by Indo-Russia Joint Venture Company, M/s BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited. 

Both these indigenously developed equipment are of the latest generation and would give a fillip to the Make-in-India initiatives of the Government. 

Continuing its focus on ‘Ease of business’ in the defence acquisition, the DAC also approved amendments to the Defence Procurement Procedure 2016.  The amendments are designed to simplify processes under the ‘Make’ category as well as ‘Offsets’.           

This was the first DAC meeting chaired by Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh since assuming office.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has said the decision taken by the Government over the last few days in nullifying Article 370 and creating two Union Territories in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh has ended the discrimination faced by the people during the last 70 years.  Addressing the annual general body meeting of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) in New Delhi today, Shri Rajnath Singh said the groundwork towards a permanent solution for this issue has been laid during the first term of Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.The decision will have some effects, he added saying that the neighbouring country is not happy and it will try to disturb peace. Our Armed Forces have accepted the security challenge and are fully prepared to meet any threats.  



Shri Rajnath Singh urged IDSA to carry out careful, meaningful and five-dimensional analysis as new threats emerged in cyber and space domains in addition to the traditional threats from land, air and sea.  He also suggested that IDSA can study and speed up processes of import of Defence merchandise.

Raksha Mantri said the Government adopted neighbourhood first policy which treats countries sharing land as well as maritime boundary with India as our neighbours.  It was reflected by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s first visit abroad in his second term to Maldives and Defence Minister Shri Rajnath Singh’s visit to Mozambique.  

Earlier, Shri Rajnath Singh was unanimously elected President of IDSA by its Executive Council.  Shri Sujan R. Chinoy, Director General, IDSA, welcomed Raksha Mantri and briefed him on the role and functions of IDSA.  Shri Rajnath Singh planted a sapling at the IDSA premises in the presence of scholars and members of IDSA.

                Raksha Mantri ShriRajnath Singh said modernisation of the Armed forces is the top priority of the government to enhance the defence capability and preparedness of the country. He visited Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) in Hyderabad today on the occasion of Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Defence PSU.

Addressing the gathering on the occasion, ShriRajnath Singh said Indigenization will be encouraged to the maximum possible extent and defence equipment will be imported only when it cannot be manufactured indigenously. He added that the defence sector will play a key role in making the country a 5-trillion economy through FDI and offset investments in manufacturing. He  hoped that defence exports will reach to a significant level by 2025. 

ShriRajnath Singh said BDL is an important defence organisation and with organizations like DRDO, ISRO,   BDL has enhanced the prestige of the country through its achievements.  ShriRajnathSingh  appreciated BDL for manufacturing more than one lakh missiles in the last 50 years.

ShriRajnath Singh said in the new world many countries have developed counter to missile technology by developing Air Defence Systems and gave a call for the development of Hypersonic Missiles technology to enhance defence capabilities of the Armed Forces. He reiterated that defence policy of the country is for peace and stability at regional, continental and global level.

He unveiled a statue of former President and Bharat Ratna Dr A P J Abdul Kalam to commemorate his legendary vision. The brainchild of Dr Kalam, Integrated Guided Missile Development (IGMD) Programme that was launched during late 80s, gave BDL plenty of opportunities to develop its skilled manpower and invest in high-end technology areas to manufacture the missiles contemplated under this Programme. The Raksha Mantri also visited the state-of-the-art production facilities at Kanchanbagh Unit of the Company.  He also released a commemorative stamp on BDL on the occasion.

Raksha Mantri ShriRajnath Singh handed over Medium Range Surface-to-Air-Missile (MR SAM) to Indian Air Force in the function. Vice Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal R K S Bhadauria received MR SAM on behalf of the IAF.

Raksha Mantri felicitated 'Veer Naris' from the State of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh as a part of Corporate Social Responsibility initiative of the BDL. ShriRajnath Singh interacteded with 22 Veer Naris who were invited to BDL on this occasion.

Raksha Mantri also inaugurated the Rain Water Harvesting facility named as 'JalNidhi' at the upcoming Unit of BDL at Ibrahimpatnam as a part of Jal Shakti Abhiyan of the Government of India. This is expected to help in meeting storage of 24 Lakh litre of water and increasing the level of underground water levels.

A five MW Solar power plant was also inaugurated by ShriRajnath Singh at BDL, Ibrahimpatnam, which demonstrates commitment of DPSU towards environment protection.

Earlier, Raksha Mantri was given a warm welcome by Chairman-cum-Managing Director of BDL Commodore Siddharth Mishra (Retd) at its premises at Kanchanbagh.  Secretary, Department of Defence Research & Development and Chairman, DRDO Dr G Satheesh Reddy was present of the occasion.

                The Indian Army in step with government policies on environmental protection has launched an ecological initiative with employing E Cars for use of its officials in New Delhi in partnership with Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), a joint Venture of Central PSUs under Ministry of Power. The introduction of E-Car in Army at Delhi was visualised on World Environment Day and launched on 01 Aug 2019 with flagging off the first lot of E-Cars for Indian Army by QMG, Lt Gen Gopal R. Army plans to operate the first batch of 10 E-Cars as a pilot project and develop further on this initiative and increase the number of E Cars in Delhi to ensure economy, efficiency and minimal emissions.

It is pertinent to mention that Army has always been at the forefront of environmental initiatives. Indian Army has a large number of Territorial Army Battalions (ECO) which have done a yeoman service in environmental protection initiatives such as forestation. Army units posted in remote and ecologically sensitive areas from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari have been carrying out various activities in close coordination with local populace to conserve the ecological balance and protect the environment.

Air pollution has been a major challenge in Delhi. Governments across the World are investing a lot of resources in fighting this menace. Electric vehicle technology has proved to be a viable alternative by reducing the carbon emission footprint. Indian companies like Tata Motors and Mahindra have taken a lead in R&D and manufacturing of Electric Cars. EESL has been the main facilitator in providing these vehicles to various Government agencies. Army’s initiative in encouraging these electric vehicles will go a long way in further development of this technology and its adoption for the general public in near future.

One SHG leader has become a Cabinet Minister in the state legislature in Tripura, and many SHG leaders arepanchayat leaders today. Communities are emerging active and vibrant through enthusiastic participation in the process of development and assuming ownership.

                The Union Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh, has said that the Government led by the Prime Minister Shri NarendraModi has given a lot of importance to the development and progress of the North Eastern Region (NER). He was addressing as the Chief Guest at the “North East Youth and Students Peace Assembly” organised on the occasion of the United Nations International Youth Day,here today. The function was organized by the Youth and Students for Peace-India, an initiative of the Universal Peace Federation (UPF), and the North East MPs’ Forum. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the focus has been on brining the rest of India closer to North east, as compared to the earlier focus of brining only North East India closer to the mainstream. This has helped in the integration and development of this region, he said. He said that the DoNER Ministry has taken various initiatives for the security of the students of NER who are studying in Delhi and other parts of the country. The Minister said that a hostel for the North Eastern girl students of Bangalore Universitywas inaugurated by the Prime Minister recently. He also said that the work for building a hostel for North East students in JNU has started. Another hostel in Rohini is also coming up for the students studying in institutions affiliated to Delhi University. 

The DoNERMinister said that more than 70% of the population in India is below the age of 40 years. They have tremendous power and capacity that needs to be channelized, he added. This huge youth power has proved to be a decisive power, he added.He said that due to technology, now the prospects for the youth have changed and now youth from all backgrounds are making it to the prestigious exams. He encouraged the youth to utilise the untapped potential of north east by having the benefit of Venture funds for start-ups in NE region. The North East has become a favourite destination for all, he added. He said that NE has unexplored potential for tourism, handlooms, and other areas, which the youth should explore. The DoNER Minister said when Government gives impetus to the Act East policy, it will be the north east region that will be benefited, due to its proximity to these neighbouring countries. This will not only enrich NE, but will also enrich whole India, he said. 

Dr Jitendra Singh added that there is much more to learn from North east youth and they are leading in all spheres of life. Earlier the connectivity used to be a barrier for development, but now Government’s focus on rail, road and air connectivity has led to the physical proximity, which has in return broken the psychological barriers. The Minister said that Prime Minister has encouraged to give special focus to the North East region. During the first term of the Government, the Prime Minister has paid more than 30 visits to the NE region, the Minister added. 

Earlier, addressing the gathering after inaugurating the function, MoS for Youth Affairs and Sports (I/C) and Minority Affairs, Shri KirenRijiju said that it is the role of every individual to contribute to the society and its well being. It is the responsibility of the whole society to work together, he emphasized. He said that participation of the youth is very important for the success of these initiatives. He added that it doesn't matter if we belong to different sections of society, we have to be united and strive for peace. Shri Rijiju said that India must start sending more volunteers to the United Nations and contribute much more to the initiatives of UN. He said that Prime Minister Shri NarendraModi has very focused attention towards youth development. Youth are the most crucial component of the society, the Minister said. The youth population is our most important asset and their energies should be utilised in right direction, he added.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Mizoram Citrus Fruit ""Centre of Excellence"" (CoE), located at Lunglei, is availing Israeli technology and has emerged as a unique of its kind institution in India which, though located in Mizoram, caters to the entire North-Eastern region and indeed, to the entire country. The issue came up during a discussion on various Mizoram State related projects when the Minister for Law & Judicial, Parliamentary Affairs, Transport, Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Shri T.J. Lalnuntluanga called on the DoNER Minister today.  

Dr Jitendra Singh expressed satisfaction that the ""Centre of Excellence"" for Citrus Fruit, which became functional last year, has started providing planting material and training to farmers with collaboration from Israel and some of the officers of Mizoram have already received their training from Israel. He said that it was an initiative of the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that followed a tripartite collaboration of the Government of Israel, State Government of Mizoram and the Union Government, with the Ministry of DoNER performing the role of facilitator and coordinator. The technical support, planting material and capacity building is being provided by Israel and the Centre specializes in exclusively dealing with the processing of Citrus Fruits, he added. 

Shri Lalnuntluanga also submitted to Dr Jitendra Singh a proposal for community based eco-tourism project envisaged to be set up at Tlangsam, Champhai in Sikkim at an estimated cost of Rs. 15 crore. The proposal stated that Mizoram, being part of the Himalayan region, has huge potentials which could be utilized for bringing up such projects and would also benefit the local community. 

The Mizoram Minister also handed over to the DoNER Minister a copy of the project proposals submitted by the State Government to the Ministry of DoNER. These include construction of Serlui Bailey Bridge, reinstallation of Artificial Football Turf at Aizawl, development of  District Hospital at Mamit, Project for control and mitigation of landslides in the State, construction and restoration of minor irrigation projects, etc.

The Minister informed that websites of 1200 KendriyaVidyalayas, 600 NavodayaVidyalayas, 18000 other CBSE affiliated schools, 30 SCERTs, 19000 organisations affiliated with NTCE among others are integrated with Shagun. Report cards of 15 lakh schools all over the country will be available on the newly created junction, the Minister explained. The portal seeks to connect approximately 92 lakh teachers and 26 crore students. He added that the websiteprovides a very robust feedback mechanism. Common people can directly give their feedback about schools which will further increase the public participation and will ensure accountability and transparency.

He added that recourse to this single source of information will immensely benefit all the stakeholders, viz. the parents and the general public, the heads of the schools, the teachers, the students, the policy makers, the officials and the researchers.

Shri Pokhriyal also informed that the website also provides vital information relating to availability of nearby schools, navigable distance vis-a vis aerial distance between schools thereby helping the policy makers in taking informed decisions.

He also announced the setting up of the Integrated National School Education Treasury (INSET) which envisages a fully integrated, instantly accessible and seamless information network for all parameters relating to the students, teachers, and schools in the country.

The main focus will be on the following areas:


	Reinforcing and cleaning the data of the Integrated Online Junction through feedback from Stakeholders
	Ensuring full inter-operability among the websites, portals and applications which are already hosted in the junction
	Creating high quality e-contents, including quizzes and puzzles to enhance learning and also for teachers in aiding  classroom transactions
	Using artificial intelligence and deep machine learning in a variety of ways to enhance the quality of school education including for designing evidence based inventions.


A booklet giving features and benefits of Shagun was also released on the occasion.

                The President of the Republic of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the first World Youth Conference on Kindness organised by the UNESCO Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development and Ministry of Human Resource Development on the theme 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: Gandhi for the Contemporary World: Celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’ at the VigyanBhavan in New Delhi today.Union Human Resource Development Minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ also graced the occasion. The conference saw participation from approximately 1,000 youth representing over 27 countries such as Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe.

 

This conference was organised with the aim to impart critical competencies (i.e. empathy, compassion, mindfulness and critical inquiry) in global youth to inspire, empower and enable them to transform themselves and build long-lasting peace in their communities. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, the conference aimed to provide global youth and policymakers an innovative, engaging and inspiring platform to come together and strive to discover ground-breaking pathways to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

 

 

 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that Mahatma Gandhi was not just a great leader and visionary, he was one who personified certain timeless ideals and values. We could place Gandhiji in a time machine and transport him to any period of human existence and we would find him to be relevant. This is also true of the times we live in. Gandhiji remains extremely relevant to our present day concerns such as need for peace and tolerance, terrorism and climate change.

The President said that the strife and violence that we see in the world today is often based in deep-rooted prejudices. These make us see the world through the binary of “us versus them”. Following Gandhiji’s footsteps, we must let ourselves and our children interact and engage with those whom we tend to define as ‘them’. Greater interaction is the best way to develop a sensitive understanding, which can help us overcome our prejudices.

The President said that education too can play an important role in overcoming our prejudices. We need to evaluate and evolve the premise, goals and structure of our education system. Education needs to go beyond mere literacy. Education must facilitate and challenge the young to search deep within themselves and build their inner strength to sympathize or relate to the suffering of others. We need to educate young people such that they can defy and transcend boundaries of class and race. We need them to be educated and creative to find solutions to entrenched structural injustices and inequities. We need an education that can touch our emotions and our spirits.

He expressed his willingness in protecting the environment, eradicating poverty, empowering women, raising the standard of living, improving health through quality education. He appealed to the world youth leaders to contribute in making a better world based on Gandhian values. 

The Minister said that, in recent times we are divided within the family, confined ourselves to computers and have made smartphones our world. Bapu's thoughts can prove helpful for us in dealing with these modern day problems arising out of materialisation. We can herald a new era by following the path of peace and non-violence and converting vision of Gandhiji into a mission. He said that this event is an attempt to revive the time-tested values ​​of kindness, non-violence, love and to draw insights for its management. 

 

On this occasion, the tenth edition of UNESCO MGIEPs’ flagship publication, The Blue Dot was unveiled. The latest edition focuses on the Institute’s main area of work, primarily in social and emotional learning.Chairman, Governing Board, UNESCO MGIEP, Shri J S Rajput; Secretary, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, R.

                Union Human Resource Development Minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ launchedthe National Mission to improve Learning Outcomes at the Elementary level- NISHTHA, National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers Holistic Advancement at Dr Ambedkar International Centre in New Delhi today.During the programme, NISHTHA Website, Training Modules, Primer Booklet and a Mobile App were also launched by the Minister.

 

 

Speaking on the occasionthe HRD Minister said that this is the  largest teachers’ training programme of its kind in the world. Giving further details, the Minister said that the basic objective of this massive training programme ‘NISHTHA’ is to motivate and equip teachers to encourage and foster critical thinking in students. He said that teachers will get awareness and develop their skills on various aspects related to Learning Outcomes, Competency Based Learning and Testing, Learner-centered Pedagogy, School Safety and Security, Personal-social qualities, Inclusive Education, ICT in teaching-learning including Artificial Intelligence, Health and well-being including yoga, Initiatives in School Education including library, eco club, youth club, kitchen garden, School Leadership qualities, Environmental Concerns, Pre-school, Pre-vocational Education and School Based Assessment in a joyful learning manner. 

The teachers are the powerhouse of the nation and they must be of the highest quality, the Minister elaborated. He further said that it is the Prime Minister’s dream that the quality of our teachers should be such that they should command worldwide respect.

            Shri Ramesh  Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ disclosed  that this training programme has been included as one of the two transformative ideas from this Department for the 100 days programme of the Government. This integrated programme aims to build the capacities of around 42 lakh participants covering all teachers and Heads of Schools at the elementary level in all Government schools, faculty members of State Councils of Educational Research and Training (SCERTs), District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs) as well as Block Resource Coordinators and Cluster Resource Coordinators in all States and UTs.

Shri Pokhriyal highlighted that the initiative is first of its kind wherein standardized training modules are developed at national level for all States and UTs. However, States and UTs can contextualize the training modules and use their own material and resource persons also, keeping in view the core topics and expected outcomes of NISHTHA.

The Minister informed that the training will be conducted directly by 33120 Key Resource Persons (KRPs) and State Resource Persons (SRP) identified by the State and UTs, who will in turn be trained by 120 National Resource Persons identified from National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA), KendriyaVidyalayaSangathan (KVS), NavodayaVidyalayaSamiti (NVS), Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Non-Government Organisations.

It was observed that the expectation from teachers in the present day is different and includes many new attributes. Teachers today are also expected to be aware of the provisions regarding Gender, The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The integrated programme therefore seeks to train all heads and teachers as first level counsellors to be alert and responsive to the needs of the students, in addition to promoting joyful learning and taking special care of the requirements of special children.

The prominent features of this integrated programme are activity based modules including educational games and quizzes, Social-emotional learning, motivational interactions, team building, preparation for school based assessment, in-built continuous feedback mechanism, online monitoring and support system, training need and impact analysis (Pre and Post training).

In order to enhance professional development of teachers, special emphasis has been given on design and development of training modules. The training Modules for NISHTHA have been developed through a consultative process involving the suggestions from the States and UTs and CBSE, KVS, NVS, School Principals and Non-Governmental Organizations, such as Kaivalya Foundation, Tata Trust, Azim Premji Foundation and Aurobindo Society. 

This mega capacity building programme has been integrated with technology to ensure smooth facilitation, availability of digital content and technology enabled teaching methods to support the teachers. A Mobile App and Learning Management System (LMS) based on MOODLE (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) have been developed by NCERT (https://nishtha.ncert.gov.in/). LMS will be used for registration of Resource Persons and Teachers, dissemination of resources, training gap and impact analysis, monitoring, mentoring and measuring the progress online.

In order to ensure sustainable impact on classroom transactions, this integrated training programme is embedded with post training interventions including provision of mentoring. After the completion of KRP training, National Resource Persons will regularly be in touch with KRPs through WhatsApp/Facebook groups etc and will form Quality Circles that will work to share ideas, challenges and their solutions and best practices. This will help in building pedagogical skills and connecting with peers, thereby leading to improvement in learning outcomes of the students.

The programme was launched by in the presence of Smt Rina Ray, Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy and other senior officers from MHRD, all States and UTs, Senior Policy Makers and Heads of Institutions.

                The Union Minister of Human Resource DevelopmentShri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ today inaugurated the International Conference titled “Journey of Teacher Education: Local to Global” in New Delhi. The two-day event is being organized by the National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) as part of silver jubilee celebration of its establishment in 1995.

Forty renowned experts from India and abroad are deliberating upon key areas like the present scenario of teacher education in the Indian context; innovations in teaching practices; integration of information and communications technology in teaching; inclusive education in teaching-learning environment; and internationalization of teacher education. Several policy makers addressed the audiences including Ms. Rina Ray, Secretary, Dept. of School Education & Literacy, MHRD, Govt. of India; Mr. R. Subrahmanyam, Secretary, Dept. of Higher Education, MHRD, Govt. of India; Mr. Yaduvendra Mathur, Special Secretary, NITI Aayog; Dr. Satbir Bedi, Chairperson, NCTE; and Mr. Sanjay Awasthi, Member Secretary, NCTE.

Speaking on the occasion the HRD Minister said that India has traditionally been known for leadership in education and teacher preparation. For thousands of years, ‘Indian Teacher’ was considered as Vishwa Guru (world’s teacher). Achievements of ancient Indian education system are legendary. School Education is the foundation of any progressive nation and teachers are the powerhouse of the society who mold and shape the future of students to become productive citizens of tomorrow and inculcate positive thinking and cultural ethos in them so that they can be an asset to the society, having both vision and a mission.”

Ms. Rina Ray, Secretary, Dept. of School Education & Literacy, MHRD, Govt. of India said “On August 22, 2019, the Ministry of Human Resource Development will be launching the world’s biggest project for teacher training named NISHTHA (National Initiative on School Teachers Head Holistic Advancement). More than 42 lakh teachers will be trained through this mission.

This initiative is in recognition of the fact that India cannot truly progress until and unless the skills of teachers are periodically upgraded. We have also mapped 15 lakh schools across the country on various platforms. In addition, 19,000 teacher training institutes in India have been mapped and put on Google Earth. Users can go online not only to see the geographical location of these institutes around the country, but also check their report card and give their feedback. Today, there are 8.5 million teachers in India, which is more than the population of Finland. We need to take care of our teachers and solve their problems. We need to focus on their welfare.” 
 Mr. Yaduvendra Mathur, Special Secretary, NITI Aayog said “The mandate of NCTE is very broad in its mission and vision and covers the entire gamut of Teacher Education Programs. Teachers are the pillars of transformation of the society, but it is important to upgrade their skills and ensure that they are trained in the best way. This is only possible in collaboration with teacher education institutions which play a key role in their actual transformation. Efficiency in teacher education is the need of the hour. International collaborations can play a key role in this.” 

Dr. Satbir Bedi, Chairperson, NCTE, said “The teacher education system is responsible for preparing teachers for the school system, who would nurture and nourish the future generations. This conference has been organized to bring our school education system in alignment with global trends. It provides a platform to eminent educationist, academicians, thinkers, practitioners and administrators to brainstorm the various issues and challenges as well as solutions for the existing teacher education system in the country.”

NCTE was established on 17th August 1995 and was tasked with achieving planned and coordinated development of teacher education system throughout the country and maintenance of norms and standards therein. NCTE also serves as an advisory body to Central and State Governments to ensure maintenance of standards and quality in Teacher Education. The mandate of NCTE is very broad and covers the entire gamut of Teacher Education programmes, including research and training of persons to equip them to teach at pre-primary, primary, secondary and senior secondary stages in schools as well as non-formal education, part-time education, adult education and distance education courses. Teacher education institutions in India currently offer 17 Teacher Education programmes recognized by NCTE for prospective school teachers.

                Union HRD Minister Sh. Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ and Union Minister for Jal Shakti Sh. Gajendra Singh Shekhawat launched ‘Samagra Shiksha-Jal Suraksha’ drive at KV no. 2 Delhi Cantt today. The dignitaries planted more than 350 saplings along with School Students and inaugurated Drip Irrigation System in the School campus. In order to create awareness about water conservation among school students, this mega drive targets to connect more than 10 crore students with this programme.

 



 

Union HRD Minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ while launching the Drive asked School Students to take pledge for saving one litre water every day. 10 Crore Students together can save 10 Cr. Litres of water per day, he said. He appealed all School Students to become brand ambassador of water conservation. Students shall spread awareness about water conservation in their School, home and locality on the lines of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

 

Union Minister for Jal Shakti Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat expressed his deep concern on water scarcity in the Country and discussed various methods of water conservation. Quoting the example of Israel he explained how a small country with very limited sources of water generated innovative methods of water conservation and became a water exporting country. He also appreciated the efforts of Ministry of HRD and Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan towards water conservation.



 

Shri ‘Nishank’ and Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat also launched a booklet prepared by Department of School Education and Literacy, titled- ‘How I am going to save 1 litre water every day?’ This booklet discusses those small efforts which can save a lot of water. 

 

Inspired by Prime Minister’s impetus on Jal Sanchay, Government of India has launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA). It is a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach. This concept of water conservation is essential for students so that they can understand the importance of water and how it is shaping their lives meaningfully, thereby enabling them to participate in water conservation activities in their day to day lives.

 

The Department of School Education & Literacy, MHRD has launched the ‘Samagra Shiksha-Jal Suraksha’ drive to promote water conservation activities for School Students, so that they can become competent, conscientious and committed water citizens of our nation. The Department has prepared a detailed outline to implement this programme in all the schools of the country.

 

Five Major Objectives:


	To educate Students learn about conservation of water
	To sensitize Students about the impact of scarcity of water
	To empower Students to learn to protect the natural sources of water
	To help every Student to save at least one litre of water per day
	To encourage Students towards judicious use and minimum wastage of water at home and school level


 

Target

One Student                -           One Day          -           To Save One Litre of Water

One Student                -           One Year         -           To Save 365 Litres of Water

One Student                -           10 Years          -           To Save 3650 Litres of Water

 

Secretary (SE&L), MHRD Ms. Rina Ray and Joint Secretary Shri R.C. Meena also graced the occasion at Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Auditorium, KV No. 2 in Delhi Cantt.

                The UGC, in its 542ndmeeting held on 02nd August 2019 has considered the reports of the Empowered Expert Committee (EEC) appointed by Government under the Chairmanship of Shri N Gopalaswami recommending  (15) Public institutions and (15) Private institutions for considering to give status of Institutions of Eminence.  

Since the scheme has only provided for (10) Public and (10) Private Institutions, the UGC has examined the list of (15) Public and (15) Private Institutions using transparent and verifiable criteria. 

The following were the principles used for identifying the (10) Public and (10) Private Institutions, from the list of (15) Public and (15) Private Institutions recommended by the EEC: 


	Since the thrust of the scheme is to prepare institutions for the global rankings, no existing institution which has NOT figured in any of the global/national ranks shall be recommended for the IoE status. 
	Only after exhausting the above criterion, if any slot remains vacant, consideration shall be given to 'yet to be established (Greenfield)' proposals.  


Public Institutions:

In accordance with the above principles, the UGC has ranked the list of (15) recommendations as per the QS-2020 World Rankings. Wherever there is a tie, used theQS-2019 India Rankings as a tie-breaker.  

Accordingly, the following are recommended for grant of IoE status:

In case of the private institutions proposed as Institutions of Eminence, there will be no financial support, but they will be entitled for more autonomy as a special category Deemed University.

The Greenfield Institutions would get 3 year period to establish and operationalise the institution, and thereafter, EEC will consider giving IoE status to such institutions.

                In a major boost towards promoting afforestation and achieving green objectives of the country, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar, today handed over Rs.47,436 crores of CAMPA funds to various states, in presence of Minister of State, MoEF&CC, Shri Babul Supriyo. In a meeting of State Forest Ministers and Authorities held at New Delhi, the Environment Minister stated “The State budget for forests shall remain unaffected and the fund being transferred would be in addition to State Budget and it is expected that all States will utilize this fund towards forestry activities to achieve the objectives of the Nationally-Determined Contributions (NDCs) of increasing its forest & tree cover, which will create an additional carbon sink equivalent to 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by the year 2030”. The Environment Minister further emphasized that the CAMPA funds cannot be used for payment of salary, travelling allowances,medicalexpenses, etc.



Underlining the efforts of the Government towards preserving and improving the forest wealth and ecological security of the country, Shri Javadekar said “Important activities on which the fund will be utilised will be for the Compensatory Afforestation, Catchment Area Treatment, Wildlife Management, Assisted Natural Regeneration, Forest Fire Prevention and Control Operations, Soil and Moisture Conservation Works in the forest, Improvement of Wildlife Habitat, Management of Biological Diversity and Biological Resources, Research in Forestry and Monitoring of CAMPA works etc”. 

                          

 

Background of CAMPA

 

With the initial experience of the States regarding under-utilisation of the money collected towards compensatory afforestation, Hon’ble Supreme Court of India ordered for establishment of Compensatory Afforestation Fund and Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) in 2001.  In 2006, separate bank accounts were opened in which the compensatory levies were deposited and adhoc CAMPA was established for the management of Compensatory afforestation fund.  In 2009, Hon’ble Supreme Court permitted release of Rs.1000 crore every year to States/UTs for compensatory afforestation and other activities.  In 2014, Hon’ble Supreme Court permitted release of 10% of total deposit of states in the fund from interest accrued on the deposits. This Act has provisioned that CAMPA funds shall be kept in interest bearing non-lapsable Public Account. After detailed deliberations with CAG and Ministry of Finance and deliberations with other Stakeholders, the fund flow mechanism could be finalized and the CAF Rules were finally put in place in 2018. After notification of CAF Rules, with approval of the Supreme Court on 28 Jan 2019, an amount of Rs.54,685 Crore from Ad-hoc CAMPA has been brought under the control of Government of India. So far 27 States/UTs have created accounts for receiving the Funds from Union Government and today funds to the tune of Rs.47,436 crore have been transferred to those States. The Fund shall be utilized as per the provisions of the CAF Act and CAF Rules.

 India will be hosting the 14th Conference of Parties (COP14) to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) from 2-13 September 2019 at India Expo Centre & Mart, Greater Noida. Delivering the keynote address at a Curtain Raiser Press Conference in New Delhi, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar, highlighted India’s resolve to combat desertification. “Desertification is a worldwide problem directly affecting 250 million people and a third of the earth’s land surface. To fight this menace, India will convert degraded land of nearly 50 lakh hectares to fertile land in next 10 years; it will implement provisions of New Delhi Declaration which is to be adopted at the end of conference and a Centre for Excellence will be established at Dehradun”, said Shri Javadekar.

 



 

The Environment Minister also expressed India’s continued commitment to stay on track on a sustainable path to land use and land management. “It is our collective responsibility to do our duty towards protecting the environment and ensuring that there is no harmful impact on  it”, said Shri Javadekar. Elaborating further on India’s key role as the President of UNCCD COP for the next 2 years, Shri Javadekar said “It is the common resolve of the World to combat desertification and India will lead from the front and move the world in a positive direction, taking into cognizance the support of other countries”.



Delegates from 196 countries comprising of scientists and representatives of national and local governments, global business leaders, NGOs, gender-based organisations, youth groups, journalists, and faith and community groups will present and share their expertise and give an overview to achieve their goals at the 12-day Conference .



 

The Convention entered into force in December 1996. It is one of the three Rio Conventions along with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). India became a signatory to UNCCD on 14th October 1994 and ratified it on 17th December 1996. The main objective of the convention is to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought in countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification, involving long-term integrated strategies that focus simultaneously, in affected areas, on improved productivity of land, and the rehabilitation, conservation and sustainable management of land and water resources, leading to improved

living conditions, in particular at the community level. The Convention’s 197 parties work together to improve the living conditions for people in drylands, to maintain and restore land and soil productivity, and to mitigate the effects of drought. The UNCCD is particularly committed to a bottom-up approach, encouraging the participation of local people in combating desertification and land degradation.

                The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change has decided to relax the mandatory charging of lease rent of Rs. 30,000/- per MW for wind power projects. 

In a review meeting Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar took a conscious decision to relax the condition of charging the lease rent of Rs. 30,000/- per MW for wind power projects. Shri Javadekar said that it is expected that this step will boost the investment in wind power projects and will help in providing wind power at cheaper rate. 

“The government envisages to meet maximum energy requirement by tapping renewal energy resources and, to achieve the target of clean energy in a time bound manner, various policies and regulations are being constantly updated.”, said the Environment minister.

Currently, to establish wind power project over forest land, the existing procedure requires payment of mandatory charges for compensatory afforestation and Net Present value (NPV). In addition to mandatory charges, the wind power companies had to pay additional lease rent of 30,000 per MW. This additional cost is not mandatory for other renewal energy projects such as solar power and hydel electric projects. Additional cost for generation of clean energy through wind power, in turn escalate the per unit cost of power at consumer level.

Promotions of such projects also strengthen Government of India commitments towards International Agreements, and one of the National Commitment pledged in Paris in 2015 was to have 40% of the power from renewable resources by 2030 .It is noteworthy that currently India has over achieved the target and is well on track to ensure that more than 50% of our installed capacity will come from renewable by 2030.

                Natural resources form the backbone of any economic development. India, as one of the fastest growing economies with GDP at 2.6 trillion USD, has increased its material consumption to six times, from 1.18 billion tonnes (BT) in 1970 to 7 BT in 2015. The material consumption is expected to increase further to provide for an increasing population, rapid urbanization and growing aspirations. Enhancing resource efficiency and promoting the use of secondary raw materials has emerged as a strategy for ensuring that the potential trade-off between growth, resource constraints and environmental well-being can be minimized.

Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change released Draft National Resource Efficiency Policy, 2019 on 25.07.2019 inviting comments and suggestions from stakeholders including public/private organizations, experts and concerned citizens on the draft policy.

The Draft National Resource Efficiency Policy (NREP) envisions a future with environmentally sustainable and equitable economic growth, resource security, healthy environment (air, water and land), and restored ecosystems with rich ecology and biodiversity. The Draft National Resource Efficiency Policy is guided by the principles of (i) reduction in primary resource consumption to ‘sustainable’ levels, in keeping with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and staying within the planetary boundaries, (ii) creation of higher value with less material through resource efficient and circular approaches, (iii) waste minimization, (iv) material security, and creation of employment opportunities and business models beneficial to the cause of environment protection and restoration.

The Draft National Resource Efficiency Policy provides an overarching collaborative framework for resource efficiency across all sectors in the country, covering both biotic and abiotic resources and life cycle stages and aspires for cross-sectoral stakeholder partnerships for the cause of resource efficiency for sustainable development.

The Draft National Resource Efficiency Policy (NREP) is available online on Ministry’s website at http://moef.gov.in/draft-national-resource-efficiency-policy2019-inviting-comments-and-suggestions-of-stakeholders-including-publicprivate-organization-experts-and-concerned-citizens/.

Comments and suggestions in prescribed format will be accepted till 24.08.2019.

                Union Minister for Environment,Forest & Climate Change and Information and Broadcasting,Shri Prakash Javadekar today attended the inaugural session of the 15th National Convention on ‘‘Housing for All By 2022’’ in New Delhi. The minister spoke at length on a range of issues related to environment approvals for building and construction projects.

Shri Javadekar said that environment approvals which used to be a stumbling block before 2014, have now been simplified and standarized. “Before 2014,it used to take 640 days for a proposal to get Environment approval but we have simplified rules and now it takes 108 days for the same and very soon it will be further brought down to 60 days but at the same time without compromising on environment protection”, said the Union Minister. 

The Environment minister said that we are entrusted with the work of both environment protection and at the same time fostering growth. “Earlier projects  above  50000 sqm used to be under the purview of centre but now even projects  above 1.5 lakh sqm and   delegated to states”, said Shri Javadekar. The minister stated that the efforts of the ministry is towards making rules simpler, making fewer rules but strict implementation of them and the focus is promoting ease of doing responsible business.

India which was represented by Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar said that BASIC countries coming together and putting views together is an important aspect of UN negotiations. “Brazil, South Africa, India and China put together has one-third of world’s geographical area and nearly 40% of the world’s population and when we unitedly speak in one voice this shows our determination and the BASIC Group could play an important part in making  Paris agreement accepted by all the countries in its true letter and spirit” , stressed Shri Javadekar. 

 



 

Shri Javadekar further added that BASIC will be united and will speak in one voice and the joint statement issued today has highlighted all the issues which are relevant today and the world must take note of what BASIC is saying ,on the eve of United Nations Session on Climate Change and the next Conference of Parties (CoP25) in Chile.

The BASIC Ministers expressed their concern for climate change and its adverse effects and reaffirmed their commitment to the successful implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol and its Paris Agreement, based on the recognition of the needs and special circumstances of developing countries and in accordance with the principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), in the light of different national circumstances. Ministers stated the importance of responsible, comprehensive,urgent and ambitious actions against climate change, including in the urban environment.

3. The Ministers stressed their support for the UNFCCC and its instruments, which remain the preeminent international forum for negotiating and addressing matters related to climate change. The BASIC countries reiterated their support for multilateralism, having made constructive engagements and significant contributions towards a series of milestones under the UNFCCC. They highlighted their determination to continue to work together with other Parties to further the process under the UNFCCC, which is irreversible.

4. Ministers underlined that BASIC countries are implementing ambitious climate action both in the pre-2020 period and in their proposed NDCs, having achieved substantial progress, notwithstanding the multiple challenges they face in terms of social and economic development and poverty eradication. They are committed to sharing best practices and supporting each other through south-south cooperation as they further develop their domestic climate policies and actions. They underscored that global climate action must promote climate justice by recognition of the fundamental right of all people in accessing economic growth and sustainable development. 

5. Ministers took note of the synthesis report on pre-2020 implementation and ambition published by the UNFCCC Secretariat in September 2018. The Ministers highlighted the significant gaps in pre-2020 climate efforts not only in mitigation, but also in adaptation and support to developing countries. They underlined that time is of the essence for any meaningful pre-2020 action and that the implementation gaps should not present a burden to developing countries in the post-2020 period.They also urged developed countries to undertake ambitious actions to reduce emissions and fulfill their finance commitments, including in the pre-2020 period, in light of their historical responsibilities.

6. The 185 ratifications, to date, of the Paris Agreement were welcomed by BASIC Ministers. They called on all remaining Parties to UNFCCC to join the Paris Agreement as soon as possible. Ministers also welcomed the 130 ratifications, to date, of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and recalled that only 14 acceptance instruments are outstanding for the amendment to enter into force. They urged Parties that have not yet done so to ratify the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible, to ensure its prompt entry into force, given the valuable contribution it could make to global climate action leading up to 2020.

7. Ministers appreciated the role of the Polish Presidency, commending its contribution to the UNFCCC process, particularly the decisions adopted in Katowice, during COP 24, CMP 14 and CMA 1, including the bulk of the Paris Agreement Work Programme. They pledged the group’s full support to the incoming Chilean Presidency of COP 25 and emphasized the importance of moving forward and reaching concrete results in Santiago, which is a crucial opportunity for closing the action and ambition gaps before 2020.

8. Ministers reiterated their commitment to work together with all Parties in an open, transparent, inclusive and Party-driven manner to achieve a balanced and comprehensive outcome on all remaining items of the Paris Agreement Work Programme. 

9. Ministers emphasized that the UNSG´s Climate Action Summit, to be held in September of this year, should be fully respectful of the principles and provisions of the UNFCCC, its Kyoto Protocol and its Paris Agreement, as well as existing aims, targets and mandates. They look forward for the Summit to send a strong political signal for global low-carbon, climate resilient and sustainable development and produce positive outcomes for pre-2020 ambition and implementation support for developing countries. The Ministers applauded the UN Secretary General’s efforts to build political momentum for enhancing climate action and support.

10. Ministers took note of the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on global warming of 1.5 °C and the Special Report on Climate Change and Land, which highlights the high vulnerability of developing countries to climate change effects, high resultant costs of adaptation and unprecedented transitions required in the development process. 

11. Ministers urged developed countries to provide adequate and predictable means of implementation to developing countries to enable them to achieve their climate goals. In this respect, developed countries are called upon to enhance support to developing countries for actions related to project or programme development and implementation, including on adaptation, mitigation and transparency. This must be done through adequate provision of finance, technology transfer, and capacity building to facilitate the effective implementation of the Convention, its Kyoto Protocol and its Paris Agreement. 

12. Ministers reaffirmed that adaptation is a key imperative for developing countries and requires an urgent global response. They emphasized the importance of the provision of enhanced as well as predictable support for adaptation from developed countries to developing countries, recognizing the adaptation efforts of developing country Parties. 

13. Ministers stressed that the enhanced transparency framework established by the Paris Agreement should facilitate exchange of information, best practices, as well as address the needs faced by developing countries, ensuring the required flexibility. Ministers underlined the significant challenges of developing countries on transparency-related capacities and urged developed countries to provide new, additional, adequate and timely finance support in this regard.

14. Ministers noted with concern the trend of developing countries being denied their right to support in different fora, including the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). They stressed in this regard that climate finance should not be a vehicle for increasing the indebtedness of developing countries.

15. The BASIC Ministers urged developed countries to fulfill their climate finance commitments of mobilizing USD 100 billion annually by 2020 for developing countries in a transparent manner and on a grant basis. This support should be new and additional, and over and above their 0.7% of GNP commitment with respect to Official Development Assistance (ODA). They noted with concern the insufficiency and inadequacy of the support provided by developed countries to date. 

16. They stressed that the 2020 deliberations on the new collective quantified goal on finance should be based on the lessons drawn from experience relating to meeting the USD 100 billion pledge, informed by the needs of developing countries and adequate to meet the ambition. In this regard, they stressed the importance of establishing a structured deliberation within the UNFCCC, in order to conclude this work. 

17. Ministers restated that a new collective quantified goal on financeby developed countries, with a significant publicly funded component, is one of the crucial signals that the regime under the UNFCCC must give to investors, both public and private, in order to match the urgency of climate change. Securing scaled-up, adequate and proper means and resources for developing countries isindispensable to enable them to meet their commitments and implement the Paris Agreement.

18. Ministers expressed the expectation that the first replenishment of the Green Climate Fund by the end of 2019 will double the initial resource mobilization pledge, ensuring that financial contributions by developed countries match the ambition, needs and priorities of developing countries. 

19. The BASIC group underscored the importance of concluding the discussions on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, one of the remaining issues from the Katowice package of decisions, which will assist those participating in implementing the Agreement in a cost effective manner. The Ministers recalled that decisions on other subjects should not pre-empt discussions under Article 6 and expressed their expectation of reaching a satisfactory outcome on this matter in December, at the Santiago COP.  They underlined that Parties should address the Article 6 issues in a balanced and inclusive manner, including the issue of transition of projects under the Clean Development Mechanism. They highlighted that Parties have a strong foundation for future work on Article 6 and that it is important to conclude work in accordance with the mandates set out in the Paris Agreement and the accompanying decision. 

20. Ministers noted the work of International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International Civil Aviation (ICAO) on reduction of carbon emissions and underscored that work being undertaken by IMO and ICAO must complement the UNFCCC, its Kyoto Protocol and its Paris Agreement and conform to their key principles, in particular Equity and CBDR-RC. 

21. Ministers highlighted the importance of mechanisms on loss and damage under the UNFCCC and urged developed country Parties to provide funding for loss and damage arising from climate change in developing countries.  

22. BASIC Ministers reiterated their unequivocal commitment to support the State of Palestine, as the Chair of the Group of 77 and China, with a view to strengthening the unity of the Group of 77 and China and advancing the common interests of developing countries. 

23. Ministers welcomed the offer of China to host the 29th BASIC Ministerial Meeting.

                Acknowledging the importance of urban environmental management for improving quality of life in cities, the Environment Ministers of BRICS countries today, agreed to work together to resolve the multifaceted environmental issues faced by BRICS cities. These discussions and announcements were made during the 5th BRICS Minister of Environment Meeting held in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This meeting was preceded by two-days meeting of BRICS Joint Working Group on Environment.

 



 

Highlighting the path breaking work done by India in achieving its Nationally Determined Contributions(NDCs) Union Environment minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar said that India under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is walking the talk on NDC’s. “We have achieved reducing energy intensity by 25% and already 78GW of renewable energy has been made possible, while at the same time forest cover has increased by nearly 15,000 sqkm and tree cover outside the forest is increasing rapidly” said the environment minister.

 



 

Stressing the key role played by BRICS countries Shri Javadekar said that BRICS is a very good platform for all five countries for co-operation and development. “All five countries are rising and have many experiences to share and these experiences will definitely help all the economies to improve further in our climate action efforts and protecting environment while ensuring growth at the same time”, added the Environment Minister. In a tail of ministerial meetings, the minister iterated that India has set an example in achieving its NDC’s and all countries need to walk the talk.

 

The Ministerial Declaration highlighted key initiatives - Partnership on Urban Environmental Sustainability Initiative (PUESI) to share knowledge and experience on important issues as waste management, cogeneration, reverse logistics, sanitation, urban air quality, urban green areas, BRICS Environmentally Sound Technology (BEST) Cooperation Platform for innovations, knowledge sharing and capacity building, and Clean River of BRICS program for improvement of river ecology and combating marine litter. Environment Ministers agreed to establish and strengthen concrete mechanisms of implementation of the cooperation initiatives with special focus on action-oriented cooperation. The key themes of urban environmental management, contaminated areas and soil remediation, water quality, circular economy in context of sustainable consumption and production, marine litter and biodiversity were agreed to be integrated into BRICS cooperation initiatives. 



 

Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar, applauded the initiatives of BRICS countries and reaffirmed India’s support to BRICS cooperation. Environment Minister highlighted key initiatives as Swachh Bharat Mission, Waste Management Rules, Nationally Determined Contributions under Paris Agreement, National Clean Air Programme, electric mobility, marine litter, urban forestry scheme, development of resource efficiency policy among others. These efforts and innovative solutions for improving urban environmental quality were well acknowledged by the BRICS countries.

 

With respect to biodiversity, BRICs countries stand committed to support the development of Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and expect the prospective framework to acknowledge the sustainable use of biodiversity and Access and Benefit Sharing components.

 

The Ministers of BRICS countries urged developed countries to fulfill their commitment under the UNFCC and its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement to provide means of implementation to developing countries including climate finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building support. BRICS countries reaffirmed the importance of jointly exploring new sources of financing individual, bilateral and multilateral projects, while highlighting access to financial resources as key to tackling environmental problems in the developing world. 

 

BRICS countries appreciated the Indian Presidency of the fourteenth session of the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Shri Javadekar invited the BRICS Ministers delegations to join at CoP-14 during 2 - 13 September, 2019 and contribute to the efforts to combat desertification and land degradation.

 

Brazil was led by Mr. Ricardo Salles, Minister of Environment. Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, Mr. Dmitry Kobylkin led the Russian delegation, while the Chinese delegation was led by Mr. Huang Runqiu, Vice-Minister of Ecology and Environment and the South African delegation was led by Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Ms. Barbara Creecy.

                Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change ,Shri Prakash Javadekar will be attending ministerial conference of BRICS (Brazil,Russia,India,China & South Africa) and BASIC countries in Sao Paulo, Brazil .BASIC countries are bloc (geopolitical alliance) of four large newly industrialized countries – Brazil, South Africa, India and China.

Before leaving for Brazil, Shri Javadekar said that India under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, is no more a back bencher but is at the forefront of environmental dialogue at the international arena. “When I went to Paris people were suspicious whether BASIC will remain intact or not. But we remained not only intact, but a force to reckon with in final negotiations, this time also we will review the status after Paris and what is the stand we need to take in UN session as well as next stop in Chile.”, said the Environment Minister

Shri Javadekar stressed that the responsibilities that we have undertaken under the Paris Agreement, we are walking the talk on that and we hope that the world especially the developed countries will also fulfill their commitments towards developing countries in terms of financial and technical assistance.

                In order to discourage cash transactions and move towards less cash economy, the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 has inserted a new section 194N in the Income-tax Act,1961 (the ‘Act’), to provide for levy of tax deduction at source (TDS) @2% on cash payments in excess of one crore rupees in aggregate made during the year, by a banking company or cooperative bank or post office, to any person from one or more accounts maintained with it by the recipient. The above section shall come into effect from 1st September, 2019.

Since the section provided that the person responsible for paying any sum, or, as the case may be, aggregate of sums, in cash, in excess of one crore rupees during the previous year to deduct income tax @2% on cash payment in excess of rupees one crore,queries were received from the general public through social media on the applicability of this section on withdrawal of cash from 01.04.2019 to 31.08.2019. 

The CBDT, having considered the concerns of the people, hereby clarifies that section 194N inserted in the Act, is to come into effect from 1st September, 2019. Hence, any cash withdrawal prior to 1st September, 2019 will not be subjected to the TDS under section 194N of the Act. However, since the threshold of Rs. 1 crore is with respect to the previous year, calculation of amount of cash withdrawal for triggering deduction under section 194N of the Act shall be counted from 1st April, 2019. Hence, if a person has already withdrawn Rs. 1 crore or more in cash upto 31st August, 2019 from one or more accounts maintained with a banking company or a cooperative bank or a post office, the two per cent TDS shall apply on all subsequent cash withdrawals.

As part of the measures for mitigating the genuine difficulties of Start-ups, it was decided that a dedicated cell would be set up under a Member of CBDT for addressing the specific problems of Start-ups. 

In order to redress grievances and address various tax related issues in the cases of Start-ups, a Start-up Cell has been constituted by CBDT on 30.08.2019 with the following ex-officio members:

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said today that an incorrect perception is being created in a section of media as if announcements made by Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, in a press conference on 23rd August 2019, which brought in a number of responsive structural measures to boost up the economy, have created a differential regime between FPIs and domestic investors including AIF category III.

 

Dispelling this false impression being created in certain sections of media including social media, CBDT said that differential regime between domestic investors (including AIF category III) and FPIs existed even prior to the General Budget 2019 and was therefore not the creation of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 or the announcement made by the Finance Ministry on 23rd August 2019.

 

In this regard, CBDT has further stated that in case of Foreign Institutional Investors (FPIs), Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) contains special provisions [section 115AD read with section 2(14) of the Act] for taxation of income from derivatives. Under this regime, income of FPIs arising from derivatives was treated as capital gains and liable for special rate of tax as per section 115AD of the Act. However, income arising from derivatives for the domestic investors including Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) category-III as well as for foreign investors who are not FPIs, has always been treated as business income and not as capital gains, and taxed at applicable normal income tax rates. The differential regime therefore already existed for FPIs through Section 115 AD. Therefore, to say that General Budget 2019 or FM’s announcement on 23rd August 2019 created a differential regime between FPI and domestic investor is incorrect.

                In order to encourage investment in the capital market, it has been decided to withdraw the enhanced surcharge levied by Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 on tax payable at special rate on income arising from the transfer of equity share/unit referred to in section 111A and section 112A of the Income-tax Act,1961(the 'Act') from the current FY 2019-20. The following capital assets are mentioned in section 111A and section 112A of the Act:


	Equity shares in a company;
	Unit of an equity oriented fund; and
	Unit of a Business Trust


The derivatives (Future & options) are not treated as capital asset and the income arising from the transfer of the derivatives is treated as business income and liable for normal rate of tax. However, in the case of Foreign Institutional Investors (FPI), the derivatives are treated as capital assets and the gains arising from the transfer of the same is treated as capital gains and subjected to a special rate of tax as per the provisions of section 115AD of the Act. Therefore, it is also decided that the tax payable on gains arising from the transfer of derivatives (Future & options) by FPI which are liable to special rate of tax under section 115AD of the Act shall also be exempted from the levy of the enhanced surcharge. 

Therefore, the enhanced surcharge shall be withdrawn on tax payable at special rate by both domestic as well as foreign investors on long-term & short-term capital gains arising from the transfer of equity share in a company or unit of an equity oriented fund/business trust which are liable for securities transaction tax and also on tax payable at special rate under section 115AD by the FPI on the capital gains arising from the transfer of derivatives. However, the tax payable at normal rate on the business income arising from the transfer of derivatives to a person other than FPI shall be liable for the enhanced surcharge.

                In theUnion Budget 2019-20, the Hon’ble Finance Minister announced the Sabka Vishwas-Legacy Dispute Resolution Scheme, 2019. The Scheme has now been notified and will be operationalized from 1st September 2019. The Scheme would continue till 31st December 2019. Government expects the Scheme to be availed by large number of taxpayers for closing their pending disputes relating to legacy Service Tax and Central Excise cases that are now subsumed under GST so they can focus on GST. 

The two main components of the Scheme are dispute resolution and amnesty. The dispute resolution component is aimed at liquidating the legacy cases of Central Excise and Service Taxthat are subsumed in GST and are pending in litigation at various forums. The amnesty component of the Scheme offers an opportunity to the taxpayers to pay the outstanding tax and be free of any other consequence under the law. The most attractive aspect of the Scheme is that it provides substantial relief in the tax dues for all categories of cases as well as full waiver of interest, fine, penalty, In all these cases, there would be no other liability of interest, fine or penalty. There is also a complete amnesty from prosecution.

For all the cases pending in adjudication or appeal – in any forum - this Scheme offers a relief of 70% from the duty demand if it is Rs.50 lakhs or less and 50% if it is more than Rs. 50 lakhs. The same relief is available for cases under investigation and audit where the duty involved is quantified and communicated to the party or admitted by him in a statement on or before 30th June, 2019. Further, in cases of confirmed duty demand, where there is no appeal pending, the relief offered is 60% of the confirmed duty amount if the same is Rs. 50 lakhs or less and it is 40%, if the confirmed duty amount is more than Rs. 50 lakhs. Finally, in cases of voluntary disclosure, the person availing the Scheme will have to pay only the full amount of disclosed duty. 

As the objective of the Scheme is to free as large a segment of the taxpayers from the legacy taxes as possible, the relief given thereunder is substantial. The Scheme is especially tailored to free the large number of small taxpayers of their pending disputes with the tax administration. Government urges the taxpayers and all concerned to avail the SabkaVishwas - Legacy Dispute Resolution Scheme, 2019 and make a new beginning.

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified today that small start-ups with turnover upto Rs. 25 crore will continue to get the promised tax holiday as specified in Section 80-IAC of the Income Tax Act, 1961(the ‘Act’), which provides deduction for 100 per cent of income of an eligible start-up for 3 years out of 7 years from the year of its incorporation.  

CBDT further clarified that all the start-ups recognised by DPIIT which fulfilled the conditions specified in the DPIIT notification did not automatically become eligible for deduction under Section 80-IAC of the Act. A start-up has to fulfil the conditions specified in Section 80-IAC for claiming this deduction. Therefore, the turnover limit for small start-ups claiming deduction is to be determined by the provisions of Section 80-IAC of theAct and not from the DPIIT notification. 

CBDT dispelled the confusion created by some media report claiming discrepancy that the I-T law was yet to reflect DPIIT’s higher turnover threshold of Rs. 100 crore. CBDT said thatthere was no contradiction in DPIIT’s notification dated 19.02.2019 and Section 80-IAC of the I.T. Act, 1961 because in para 3 of the said notification, it has clearly been mentioned that a start-up shall be eligible to apply for the certificate from the Inter-Ministerial Board of Certification for claiming deduction under Section 80-IAC of the Act, only if the start-up fulfils the conditions specified in sub-clause (i) and sub-clause (ii) of the Explanation of Section 80-IAC. Therefore, the turnover limit for eligibility for deduction under section 80-IAC of the Act, as per the DPIIT’s notification is also Rs. 25 crore.

It is further stated that Section 80-IAC contains a detailed definition of the eligible start-up which, interalia, provides that a start-up which is engaged in the eligible business shall be eligible for deduction, if (i) it is incorporated on or after 1st April 2016, (ii) its turnover does not exceed Rs. 25 crore in the year of deduction, and (iii) it holds a certificate from the Inter-Ministerial Board of Certification.

It was explained that this was the major reason as to why there was a wide difference between the number of start-ups recognised by the DPIIT and the start-ups eligible for deduction under section 80-IAC of the Act. It is pertinent to state that Section 80-IAC was inserted vide Finance Act, 2016 as an exception to the Government’s stated policy of phasing out profit-linked deduction for promoting small start-ups during their initial year of operation. Since the intention was to support the small start-ups, the turnover limit of Rs. 25 crore was considered reasonable for granting profit linking deduction.

                Two Arrests have been made by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (HQs) in cases of fraudulent IGST refund claims here, today. As per the statement of the DGGI (HQs), the action was taken on receipt of an input from Allahabad Bank, Paschim Vihar, New Delhi that suspicious transactions were noticed in the accounts of 4 proprietorship firms (Monal Enterprises & Ors.) wherein large quantum of IGST refunds had been received by them immediately after their opening, without any prior business transaction history. Further, the refunds credited to these bank accounts were withdrawn/transferred in quick succession. Developing on the input, DGGI (HQs) verified that the addresses of these firms were either non-existent or the firms were not operating at the given addresses.

Further investigations revealed that the said 4 firms were in the names of benami individuals whose identification documents had been fraudulently obtained for the opening of these bank accounts and to obtain GST registrations. It was further revealed that the said 4 firms had no corresponding purchases against the exports claimed to have been made by them, nor had any export proceeds been realized. E-way bill data also revealed that corresponding movement of goods did not exist. Therefore, the said 4 firms had indulged in fraudulent   availment   of   IGST   refunds   on   the   basis   of   fake   invoices. 

Investigations further revealed that Shri Ramesh Wadhera the mastermind who was controlled these fake firms and operated them with the connivance and active involvement of Shri Mukesh Kumar who fraudulently obtained identification documents used in this racket, from gullible employment seekers. It was further found that 10 more similar fake/fraudulent firms are being operated by the said two individuals. The total fraudulent IGST refund availed by these 14 firms amounts to Rs. 44 Crore, approximately. Searches were conducted at several premises over 13-15th August, 2019. Shri Ramesh Wadhera and Shri Mukesh Kumar have been arrested under the provisions of Section 69 of the CGST Act, read with Section 20 of the IGST Act, 2017 for their active role in defrauding the Exchequer by claiming fraudulent IGST refunds. Shri Ramesh Wadhera is learnt to have several old cases of DRI/Customs against him.

Further investigations in the matter are under progress.

                With a view to bringing greater transparency in the functioning of the tax-administration and improvement in service delivery, almost all notices and orders of Income Tax Department are being generated electronically on the Income Tax Business Application (ITBA) platform. However, it has been brought to the notice of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) that there have been some instances in which the notice, order, summons, letter and any correspondence (hereinafter referred to as “communication”) were found to have been issued manually, without maintaining a proper audit trail of such communication. 

In order to prevent such instances and to maintain proper audit trail of all communication, the CBDT has, vide Circular No.19/2019 dated 14.08.2019 laid down parameters specifying the manner in which any communication issued by any income-tax authority relating to assessment, appeals, orders, statutory or otherwise, exemptions, enquiry, investigation, verification of information, penalty, prosecution, rectification, approval etc. to the assessee or any other person will be dealt with. All such communication issued on or after the 1st of October, 2019 shall carry a computer-generated Document Identification Number (DIN) duly quoted in the body of such communication.

CBDT has also specified exceptional circumstances where the communication may be issued manually but only after recording reasons in writing and with the prior written approval of the Chief Commissioner / Director General of Income-Tax concerned. In cases where manual communication is required to be issued, the reason for issue of manual communication without DIN has to be specified alongwith the date of obtaining written approval of the Chief Commissioner / Director General of Income-Tax in a particular format. Any communication which is not in conformity with the prescribed guidelines shall be treated as invalid and shall be deemed to have never been issued. Further, CBDT has also laid down the timelines and procedure by which such communication issued manually will have to be regularised and intimated to the Principal Director General of Income-tax (Systems).

            In addition to the above, in all pending assessment proceedings, where notices were issued manually, prior to issuance of the above referred Circular, all such cases would be identified and the notices so sent would be uploaded on ITBA by 31st October, 2019.

This is another step taken by CBDT towards better delivery of taxpayer services while ensuring accountability in official dealings.

                In pursuance of the announcement made in the Union Budget 2019-20 presented by the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, the Government has issued a scheme regarding partial credit guarantee on 10.8.2019. The Scheme would enable the public sector banks (PSBs) to purchase pooled assets of financially sound NBFCs amounting to Rs. one lakh crore. It is expected that this measure would provide liquidity to the NBFC Sector and, in turn, enable them to continue to play their role in meeting the financing requirements of the productive sectors of economy including MSME, retail and housing.

It may be recalled that the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget Speech for the Union Budget 2019-20 had made the following announcement to support fundamentally sound Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in getting continued funding from banks:

“For purchase of high-rated pooled assets of financially sound NBFCs, amounting to a total of Rupees One lakh crore during the current financial year, Government will provide one time six months’ partial credit guarantee to Public Sector Banks for first loss of up to 10%.”

The details of the Scheme launched in this respect are as below –

Name of the Scheme: 'Partial Credit Guarantee offered by Government of India (GoI) to Public Sector Banks (PSBs) for purchasing high-rated pooled assets from financially sound Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)/Housing Finance Companies (HFCs)’.

Objective: To address temporary asset liability mismatches of otherwise solvent NBFCs/HFCs without having to resort to distress sale of their assets for meeting their commitments.

Validity of the scheme: The window for one-time partial credit guarantee offered by GoI will open from the date of issuance of the Scheme by the Government for a period of six months, or till such date by which Rupees One lakh crore assets get purchased by banks, whichever is earlier.

A. Operational Guidance:

(i)   The assets shall be purchased by banks at fair value. 

(ii)   Assets to be assigned by NBFCs/HFCs must be rated by Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) accredited by Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 

(iii) One-time guarantee provided by the GoI on the pooled assets will be valid for 24 months from the date of purchase and can be invoked on the occurrence of default as outlined under heading 'D' below. The guarantee shall cease earlier if the purchasing bank sells the pooled assets to the originating NBFC/HFC or any other entity, before the validity of the guarantee period.

(iv)  The purchasing banks may have service level agreements with the originating NBFCs/HFCs for servicing, including administration of the individual assets.

(v)   The NBFCs/HFCs can have the option to buy back their assets after a specified period of 12 months as a repurchase transaction, on a right of first refusal basis.

B. Eligible NBFCs/HFCs:

(i) The NBFCs registered with RBI under the Reserve Bank of India Act, excluding those registered as Micro Finance Institutions and Core Investment Companies.

(ii)   HFCs registered with National Housing Bank (NHB) under the National Housing Bank Act.

(iii)  The CRAR of NBFCs/CAR of HFCs should not be below the regulatory minimum (i.e. 15% for NBFCs and 12% for HFCs) as on 31.3.2019.

(iv)  Their net Non-Performing Asset should not be more than 6% as on 31.3.2019.

(vi)  The NBFCs/HFCs should not have been reported under SMA category by any bank for their borrowings during last one year prior to 1.8.2018.

(vii) Micro Finance Institutions and Core Investment Companies are not covered under the Scheme.                                                            

C. Eligible assets:


	Assets originated up to 31.3.2019 will only be eligible under this scheme.
	Assets should be standard in the books of NBFCs/HFCs on the date of sale.
	The pool of assets should have minimum rating of 'AA' or equivalent at fair value prior to the partial credit guarantee by GoI.
	Each account under the pooled assets should have been fully disbursed and security charge should have been created in favour of the originating NBFCs/ HFCs.
	NBFCs/HFCs can sell up to a maximum of 20% of their standard assets as on 31.3.2019 subject to a cap of Rs. 5,000 crore at fair value. Any additional amount above the cap of Rs. 5,000 crore will be considered on pro rata basis, subject to availability of headroom.
	The underlying assets should represent the debt obligations of a homogeneous pool of obligors and individual asset size in the pool is capped at Rs. 5 crore (i.e. asset pool should be sufficiently granular).
	Originating NBFCs/HFCs cannot assign the following assets under this Scheme:


a)  Revolving credit facilities;

b)  Assets purchased from other entities; and

c)   Assets with bullet repayment of both principal and interest.

D. Invocation of Guarantee:

The purchasing bank can invoke the GoI guarantee if the interest and/or instalment of principal remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days (i.e. when liability is crystalised for the underlying borrower) during the validity of such guarantee, subject to the condition that the guarantee is for the first loss up to 10 per cent.

E. Reporting and claims:


	There should be a process of real time reporting of such transactions by the banks to GoI and to get the information on remaining available headroom for purchase of such pooled assets. The Department of Financial Services (DFS), Ministry of Finance would obtain the requisite information in a prescribed format from the PSBs and send a copy to the budget division of DEA.
	GoI shall settle such claims by the banks within 5 working days from the date of claim.
	Upon recovery of the accounts for which the purchasing bank had invoked the GoI guarantee and received the claim from GoI, the guarantee amount, or the amount recovered, whichever is lower, should be passed on by banks to the GoI within 5 working days from the days of receipt in its books, subject to the condition that in case the guarantee amount is lower than the recovery shortfall the gap would be filled by the bank receiving the guarantee, but when the recovered amount is higher than the guarantee amount, than the excess over the guarantee amount would be kept by the bank.
	Any loss crystalised up to 24 months is eligible for claim from GoI under the Scheme, provided such pooled assets are not (a) bought back by the concerned NBFCs/HFCs or (b) sold by the purchasing bank to other entities.


F.  Guarantee Fees:

NBFCs/HFCs will pay a fee equivalent to 0.25% per annum of the fair value of assets being purchased by the bank under this Scheme to GoI (must be routed through the purchasing bank).

G. The NBFCs/HFCs whose assets are sold under this Scheme shall undertake the following:


	It should rework the Asset Liability structure within three months to have positive ALM in each bucket for the first three months and on cumulative basis for the remaining period.
	At no time during the period for exercise of the option to buy back the assets, should the CRAR go below the regulatory minimum. The promoter shall ensure this by infusing equity, where required.

                There have been reports in the media about Income Tax notices being issued to Durga Puja Committees in Kolkata recently. The reports also mention that Income Tax notices were sent to the Durga Puja Committee Forum in the last few weeks. It is unequivocally stated that the said reports are factually incorrect and are strongly denied. It is a fact that no notice was issued to the Durga Puja Committee Forum by the Department during this year. 

However, as the Department had been getting information that several contractors who were doing work for the Puja committees were not paying due taxes, therefore notices under section 133(6) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 were issued in December, 2018 to about 30 committees, calling for details of tax deducted at source on payments made to contractors and event managers etc. engaged by the committees for the Puja events, including the TDS statement. This was part of an exercise carried out by the TDS wing of the Department to ensure that the contractors and event managers pay their due taxes in time. Many of the committees complied and furnished evidence of tax deducted at source as well as deposit of the same into the Government account. 

It is also pertinent to state that several committees requested the Department to organise educative sessions to explain the provisions of TDS to the committees. Taking a cue from the same, one such outreach programme was organised on the 16th of July, 2019 for the Durga Puja Committees at their own request. Nearly eight (8) members of the Forum attended the outreach programme voluntarily and were educated about the provisions of TDS. Their doubts pertaining to TDS provisions were also clarified. 

It is reiterated that the aforesaid exercise is in no manner whatsoever against the Puja Committees, but has been undertaken to ensure that the contractors and event managers pay their due taxes correctly within the stipulated time.

                The Income Tax Department conducted a search and seizure operation on 06.08.2019 in the case of one of the major producers of beer and IMFL in Tamil Nadu. The search action was launched in the early hours of Tuesday at 55 premises in various places in Tamil Nadu including Chennai, Coimbatore, Thanjavur, etc and also in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Goa. The premises included residences of the promoters, key employees and some of the suppliers of materials.

The search action was based on intelligence gathered over several months that the business group was indulging in large scale tax evasion by inflating its expenditure on materials used in its production processes. During the search action, the search teams found telltale evidence of the modus operandi of the group. The modus operandi involved over-invoicing of purchase of raw materials and bottles which constituted a major portion of the cost of production. The suppliers received payment at the inflated value by cheque or RTGS, but paid back the excess value in cash to key confidante employees of the group. The search teams gathered evidence of such over-invoicing and return of cash by suppliers. Such inflation by over invoicing amounted to suppression of taxable income  of almost Rs 400 crore over a period of six years. 

The search also resulted in unearthing of evidence of similar tax evasion by another leading business group in the same liquor industry. Consequently, the Department launched search operation in the case of the second group also on 09.08.2019. About seven premises of this group at Chennai and Karaikal were covered in the second phase of the search operation. The search is still in progress and the suppression of taxable income detected in this group has been estimated to be about Rs 300 crore.

Based on a tip off during the search action, the tax officers tracked down employees moving with unaccounted cash and intercepted them and recovered Rs 4.5 crore cash from the car in which they had concealed it. The search action has thus far resulted in detection of undisclosed income of Rs 700 crore which had not been disclosed for taxation.

                In a swift and coordinated action on Friday, 2nd August 2019, the Investigation Wing of Income Tax Department, NER carried out searches on certain businessmen in Meghalaya found to be involved in running a web of petrol pumps managed and controlled as benami properties. These persons were depriving the State Government of legitimate revenue by suppressing sales and non-deposit of local taxes collected, while also indulging in massive evasion of income tax by misusing exemption under Section 10(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 meant for tribal persons.

In the enforcement operation that commenced in the early hours and went on till wee hours of the next day, more than Rs 2 crore of unaccounted cash alongwith incriminating documents have been seized by officials of the Department. The cash found was hidden in unexpected places like water tanks.

This search by the Department was a much needed action on a long existing racket run by some unscrupulous elements exploiting local citizens of Meghalaya and avoiding paying income tax using tribal persons who are exempted from income tax, as a front. The pre-search investigation involved extensive surveillance and covert enquiries which were continuing for over a year.

Following the searches exposing these benami petrol pumps, the Executive Committee (EC) member of Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) in-charge of trade, announced to the media on the 8th of August, 2019 that urgent steps will be taken to prevent benami transactions in the State. He noted that despite the law, benami transactions are thriving due to collusion between some local people and their non-tribal business partners. The KHADC is a statutory autonomous body which regulates various aspects of trade and commerce in Meghalaya.

The action taken by the Department has been widely appreciated by the public and also local authorities as a timely and positive step that will help to control the menace of benami commercial activities, as well as augment Government revenues.

                The Finance Ministry has simplified the process of assessment in the case of Startup entities. 

In cases where scrutiny assessments of Startup entities are pending, the CBDT has decided that:

i) In case of Startup Companies recognized by DPIIT which have filed Form No. 2  and whose cases are under “limited scrutiny” on the single issue of applicability of section 56(2)(viib),the contention of the assessee will be summarily accepted.

ii) In case of Startup Companies recognized by DPIIT which have filed Form No. 2 and whose cases have been selected under scrutiny to examine multiple issues including the issue of section 56(2)(viib),this issue will not be pursued during the assessment proceedings and inquiry on other issues will be carried out by the Assessing Officer only after obtaining approval of the supervisory authority.

iii) In case of Startup Companies recognized by the DPIIT, which have not filed Form No. 2, but have been selected for scrutiny, the inquiry in such cases also will be carried out by the Assessing Officer only after obtaining approval of the supervisory authorities.

In addition to the above, the Central Government has further decided to relax Para-6 of the DPIIT notification No.127 (E) dated 19.02.2019 and make it clear that this notification will also be applicable to Startup Companies where addition under section 56(2)(viib) has been made and the assessee has been recognized by DPIIT and subsequently filed Form No. 2. The Circular to this effect in F.No 173/149/2019-ITA-1 of CBDT dated 8th August, 2019, has been placed on www.incometaxindia.gov.in.

                There is a substantial pendency of appeals of the Income Tax Department before various appellate fora. The CBDT is aware of the importance of litigation management and has been continuously working towards achieving the same.

To effectively reduce taxpayer grievances/litigation and help the Department focus on litigation involving complex legal issues and high tax effect, the monetary limits for filing of appeals by the Department were last revised on 11th July,2018 vide CBDT Circular No.3 of 2018. As a step towards further management of litigation by the Government,  the monetary limits for filing Departmental appeals before various appellate fora including ITAT, High Court & Supreme Court have been revised as under:




	
		
			
			Appellate Forum
			
			
			Existing Monetary Limit(Rs.)
			
			
			Revised Monetary Limit(Rs.)
			
		
		
			
			Before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
			
			
			20,00,000
			
			
			50,00,000
			
		
		
			
			Before High Court
			
			
			50,00,000
			
			
			1,00,00,000
			
		
		
			
			Before Supreme Court
			
			
			1,00,00,000
			
			
			2,00,00,000
			
		
	


 

This will further reduce time, effort and resources presently deployed in litigation to focus on issues involving litigation of substantial value.

                The Income-tax return (ITR) forms for the Assessment Year 2019-20 have been notified on 01.04.2019. Subsequently, queries have been raised by the stakeholders in respect of filling-up of the ITR forms. These queries are primarily in respect of the reporting of certain details in the ITR forms, such as reporting of directorship in a foreign company, reporting of equity shares listed outside India, unlisted shares which were previously listed, reporting of unlisted shares received by way of gift, will, amalgamation etc. and reporting of certain assets held as stock-in-trade.

The queries have been examined by CBDT and have been clarified vide Circular No. 18 /2019 dated 08th August, 2019. A copy of the Circular has been placed on www.incometaxindia.gov.in.

                Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs reviewed the performance of banks, here, today in a meeting with the top management of Public Sector Banks, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Citi Bank. RBI Deputy Governor N. S. Vishwanathan also participated in the review. 

Today’s meeting is the first of a series of meetings that the Ministry of Finance is convening to discuss current economic issues with key stakeholders, including some of the industry sectors whose growth has been affected in recent months. Today’s meeting was on the banking sector. This will be followed by meetings with the MSME sector, the automobile sector, industry associations, financial market stakeholders, and real estate and home-buyers in coming days. The Government will factor in the takeaways from these consultations for appropriate policy responses to maintain a high growth trajectory and to address sector-specific issues.

Today’s meeting on the banking sector focussed on overall credit growth to support the needs of the economy. Further, ways in which banks may help some of the sectors that have been drivers of economic growth to deal with their current issues were discussed. In particular, the credit needs of the NBFC, automobiles and MSME sectors were discussed. Transmission of benefits of rate cuts to borrowers and industry was also discussed. Digitalisation efforts were reviewed with a view to step up efforts in this direction. Banks also articulated some issues they have been facing in service tax, and these were taken note of by the Revenue Secretary and Chairman, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs.

Overall credit

Overall credit growth from the banking system continues to be at 12%, which is marginally lower than the growth of 13.3% at the end of March. At the same time, with turnaround in the NPA cycle, high provision cover of over 75%, and record recovery, bank balance-sheets are healthier than before. Banks are now, therefore, in position to step up lending. 

Contactless digital lending

Against this backdrop, banks committed in the review to step up affordable and hassle-free credit, with a special focus on the MSME and consumer finance sectors. As part of this, banks have decided to increase the in-principle approval limit for contactless digital lending to MSMEs on the PSB59minutes.com portal to Rs. 5 crore. Going forward, banks would be expanding the contactless digital lending facility through the portal to retail lending products for personal loans, vehicle loans and home loans.

 

Co-origination of loans

In the review, banks also committed to leverage co-origination of loans jointly by banks and NBFCs under RBI’s co-origination policy. This will combine the advantages of lower cost funds and large financing capacity of banks with the doorstep reach of the NBFC sector, to the benefit of both. It will also enhance consumer ease through doorstep delivery of lending and repayment services.

 

NBFC and HFC sector

It was noted in the review that bank credit to the NBFC and HFC sector has risen by nearly Rs. 90,000 crore since September 2018, helping address the sector’s liquidity needs. In addition, pool buy-outs of over Rs. 40,000 crore by Public Sector Banks have helped the NBFC and HFC sector reduce their asset liability mismatch. In the review, banks committed to continue supporting the sector by making prudent use of partial credit guarantee from the Government for purchase of pooled assets of NBFCs and HFCs of up to Rs. 1 lakh crore.

National Housing Bank has also brought out a new scheme to enable HFCs to take refinance from NHB for their pool of existing developer loans as well as individual housing loans and HFCs can then use the liquidity so provided exclusively for individual loans for affordable housing. 

Automobile sector

The automobile sector has witnessed falling sales. Sales in this sector have been driven by vehicle loans, in which NBFCs had a major share. In view of the decline in NBFC credit for vehicle finance, banks have committed to step up credit support for vehicle purchases.

MSME sector

Banks would redouble efforts to extend cheaper, hassle-free and cash-flow based credit to MSMEs by leveraging GST, digital payments and alternate data. Banks would also expedite restructuring of viable MSME units facing stress, under the special MSME restructuring dispensation available till March 2020. 

The recommendations of the U. K. Sinha committee would be taken forward. The committee had highlighted the need to meet working capital requirements of India’s growing MSME service. In the review, banks agreed to come out with specific working capital products for service sector MSME units.

Interest rate transmission

Since December 2018, monetary policy has been eased substantially with policy rates being cut by 75 basis points and the policy outlook being changed to accommodative. Banks need to commensurately transmit rate cut benefit in lending. In the meeting, banks agreed to take steps as per RBI guidelines to review their lending rates.

Digitalisation

As a result of Government’s thrust on digitalization, digital transactions have grown to 769% of GDP by March 2019, up from 726% a year ago. The recent amendments mandating that business establishments with over Rs. 50 crore turnover accept digital payments and waiver of charges on NEFT and RTGS will give a fillip to further digitalisation. 

In the review, banks committed to review charges on digital payments with a view to making them cheaper for customers vis-à-vis cash payments. They also committed to expand services available through mobile and Internet banking and offer services on these digital platforms in regional languages as well. 

Service tax issues relating to banking

Banks also articulated some issues they have been facing in service tax, and these were taken note of by the Revenue Secretary and Chairman, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. These will be examined by the Government at the appropriate time.

                Central GST Delhi North Commissionerate has busted a racket of issuance of fake invoices without actual supply of goods and services. Two individuals – Asrar Akhtar and Vikas Singh have been arrested in this matter and remanded to judicial custody for 14 days by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM), New Delhi at Patiala House Courts. The accused and their associates were found to be operating 19 fake firms created to facilitate fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC), thus defrauding the Exchequer. Prima facie fraudulent ITC of about Rs 25 crores has been detected to have been passed on using invoices involving an amount of Rs 137 crores.

The modus operandi of these individuals and their associates Sabban Ahmed and Arif, inter alia, involved issuance of fake invoices of firms registered across Delhi NCR from a premise in Azadpur, Delhi. Voluminous incriminating documents such as fake invoices, diaries, letter-heads, rubber stamps of fake firms, cheque books, transporter’s consignment notes as well as electronic devices have been recovered. Investigations are underway to identify other individuals and firms involved in this racket. 

The accused have committed offences under the provisions of Section 132(1)(b) of the CGST Act 2017, which are cognizable and non-bailable under Section 132(5) and punishable under Section 132(1)(i) of the said Act. Accordingly, Asrar Akhtar and Vikas Singh were arrested on 01.08.19 and have been remanded to judicial custody for 14 days on 02.08.2019.

                The Income Tax Department conducted Search and Seizure operation on 29.07.2019 on a prominent group involved in Real Estate Development, covering more than 40 premises across Mumbai and Pune.  During the course of search operations, the Department unearthed evidences related to receipt of ‘On Money’ on sale of commercial and residential blocks, bogus unsecured loans taken, bogus Long Term Capital Gains and various other sham transactions to evade income aggregating to about Rs.700 crore.

The search action has unravelled peculiar transactions wherein by way of accounting jugglery, income on transactions worth about Rs.525 crore has been evaded.  ‘On Money’ receipt on sale of Residential / Commercial Blocks amounting to Rs.100 crore has been corroborated during the search. During the search, incriminating evidence was unearthed pertaining to modus operandi establishing the introduction of accommodation loans by the group, which have been found to be bogus.  Moreover, use of entry providers / hawala operators for entries of Long Term Capital Gains by the promoters of this real estate group have been affirmed during the search action.  The action has also resulted into detection of jewellery worth approximately Rs.14 crore, which is under verification.

The investigation and search action is still in progress.

Banks will be utilising this guarantee support as per the contours of the scheme.

To further ease flow of funds to the housing sector, the National Housing Bank (NHB) is making available from today, a liquidity infusion facility of Rs. 10,000 Cr. for Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) as additional liquidity for individual housing loans, for affordable housing. Details of the facility will be available on the NHB website later today. This facility shall be over and above the two existing refinance schemes of NHB.

MSME Expert Committee

The Expert Committee on MSMEs headed by Sh. U.K. Sinha has submitted its report in June this year. The Sinha committee has made over a hundred far reaching recommendations for the MSME sector. These recommendations encompass various domains such as credit, equity funding, technology, marketing, delayed payments, institutional arrangements, need for legislative changes, rural enterprises, SHGs, risk mitigation for MSMEs, setting up of specific funds by Government etc. Taken together, the recommendations seek to enhance competitiveness of our MSMEs and their access to credit.

                Considering the important role being played by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) in the economic development, it was announced in the Budget Speech for 2019-20 that the Government would provide a one time six months’ partial credit guarantee to PSBs for the first loss of up to 10 percent to enable them to purchase pooled assets of financially sound NBFCs amounting to Rs. 1 lakh crore. This would ease the liquidity stress in the NBFC sector and increase the access of these NBFCs to bank finance, and, in turn enable them to continue to play their role in meeting the financing requirements of the productive sectors of the economy.

The Government has received a proposal from RBI on draft modalities of the guarantee to operationalize the above Budget announcement. The Government has accorded its approval to the modalities that would set in motion by RBI. The Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance would put in place an oversight mechanism for this scheme.

                The Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, as part of its strategic commitment to improve global trade, is conducting India’s first national Time Release Study (TRS) between 1st – 7th August. The exercise will be institutionalized on an annual basis, during the same period every year hereafter. The TRS is an internationally recognized tool advocated by World Customs Organization to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of international trade flows.

This initiative for accountable governance, will measure rule based and procedural bottlenecks (including physical touchpoints) in the clearance of goods, from the time of arrival until the physical release of cargo. The aim is to identify and address bottlenecks in the trade flow process and take the corresponding policy and operational measures required to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of border procedures, without compromising efficient trade control. Expected beneficiaries of this initiative will be export oriented industries and MSMEs, who will enjoy greater standardization of Indian processes with comparable international standards.

This initiative will help India maintain the upward trajectory on Ease of Doing Business, particularly on the Trading Across Borders indicator which measures the efficiency of the cross border trade ecosystem. Last year India’s ranking on the indicator improved from 146 to 80. 

Previously individual customs formations had been independently conducting TRS studies at the port level.  The national TRS has taken this a step further and evolved a uniform, multi-dimensional methodology which measures the regulatory and logistics aspects of the cargo clearance process and establishes the average release time for goods.

The exercise will be conducted at the same time across 15 ports including sea, air, land and dry ports which cumulatively account for 81% of total Bills of Entries for import and 67% of Shipping Bills for export filed within India. The national TRS will establish baseline performance measurement and have standardized operations and procedures across all ports.

Based on the results of the TRS, government agencies associated with cross border trade will be able to diagnose existing and potential bottlenecks which act as barriers to the free flow of trade, and take remedial actions for reducing the cargo release time. The initiative is on ground lead by the Central Board of Indirect Tax and Customs.

A high level meeting was held under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying to review the milk situation in the country today. The meeting was attended by senior officers of State Cooperative Dairy Federations/, CEOs/Managing Directors of Private Dairies, Representatives from Ministry of Women & Child Development, School Education and Literacy, Commerce & Industries, National Dairy Development Board & APEDA. 

In view of announcement by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on Independence Day, AMUL and Mother Dairy were requested to formulate action plan/protocol to recycle milk pouches and share with Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying for circulation to other Milk Federations for implementation. 

The Secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying requested Major Dairy Federations like Gujarat Milk Federation (Amul), Karnataka Milk Federation (Nandini), Punjab Milk Federation (Verka), Maharashtra Milk Federation (Mahanand) to encourage reuse of plastic milk pouches, in a campaign mode, with 3R strategy – Reduce, Rebate and Reuse. i.e. REDUCE consumption of plastics by subsidizing price of 1 litre pack over ½ litre pack, REBATE to customers for bringing back plastics, REUSE of pouches for users such as Road construction, recyclers.

Secretary, Animal Husbandry and Dairying requested all Cooperative Milk Federations and Private Dairies to at least halve plastic use by Gandhi Jayanti (2nd October).  Media was requested to start a campaign like Swachcha Bharat to discourage plastics and thereby improve environment. 

The meeting also reviewed the availability, supply, prices and export/import issues with the milk processors. The milk procurement price was observed to have increased by Rs.1-2 across the country. The representatives were requested to focus on the quality aspects of milk and reduction in cost of production. The views of the stakeholders present in the meeting were sought on breeding, feeding, disease management, traceability etc. to draw the policy to double productivity, exports and farmers income by next 5 years.

                “I want NBCC to make a sincere effort to finish the work in one year as against the eighteen months stipulated byit with the target of building the best sport injury center in the world.” This was stated by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare as he laid the Foundation Stone of Sports Injury Expansion Project at Safdarjung Hospital, here today in the presence of Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS (HFW).

At the function, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that under our beloved and inspirational Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,there is a renewed focus on sports and the government is encouraging it like never before. The charismatic Prime Minister has said that New India should also be a Fit India, and he has launched the FitIndia Campaign yesterday to inspire people from all walks of life to adopt healthy lifestyle. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated that under the leadership of our Prime Minister we are aggressively moving towards setting up state-of-the-art health facilities with the best equipment, techniques and buildings. “These facilities are comparable to the very best in the country and the world, and it’s not only in Delhi, but such facilities are being created all over the country,” he said. As we move towards the vision of the Prime Minister of a New India by 2022, health shall be one of the key determinants and components of our advanced country, he stated.

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that Sports Injury Centre here shall be one of the most modern state-of-the-art sports injury centres in the world with the best facilitiescomparable to any part of the world. It shall cover every aspect of the sports injury. It will provide diagnostic, physiotherapy, rehabilitative, surgical and inpatient facilities, etc., to people suffering from sports and related injuries under one roof, he added.

He further stated that one of the priorities of the government is to expand quality tertiary health care facilities in all parts of the country. With the announcement of new AIIMS, the total number of AIIMS has gone up to 22. Further, super specialty blocks along with MCH wings are being set up in many districthospitaland medical college across the country. Apart from the already planned 82,additional 75 new medical colleges will be set up all over the country by 2022. These new medical colleges will come up in under-served areas having no medical college; with at least 200 bedded District Hospital. Preference will be given to Aspirational Districts and District Hospital having 300 beds, he added. This has been approved by the CCEA two days back.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS (HFW) congratulated Safdarjung Hospital for providing a gamut of services to the people. He also laid stress on completing the project before the deadline and stated that ‘sarvesantuniramaya’ i.e. health for all is the policy mandate of the Government and we will make all efforts towards fulfilling the same.

Sports Injury Expansion Project

There is an exponential increase in the number of patients visiting the Sports Injury Centre from 52133 in 2011 to 1,20101 in 2018.  Once completed, the new centre will have increased bed strength of 156 (including HDU and ICU beds) compared to the existing 42 beds and the Center will have a larger area. It will bring this Centre to global standards of excellence. The expansion will also help in increasing the PG seats to create trained manpower that can spread across India and treat sportsmen at the field level. The expansion will develop state-of-the-art labs to train doctors of India for surgical and nonsurgical management of sports injuries. 

The expansion will also reduce the waiting period of surgery for sportsmen (current waiting 3 months) so that they can return to sports activities at the earliest.  Facilities like Gait lab, 3 D motion analysis system, underwater training system etc., for managing sportsmen and sports related injuries and training purposesare envisaged to be part of the expansion project. The specialty of sports medicine will be further strengthened by initiating research in various sub specialties of sports medicine. It will help to create an education system for sportsmen and to devise protocols for sports specific performance enhancement. The total cost involved for expansion of the Sports Injury Centreis Rs. 483cr. 

SmtPreeti Sudan, Secretary (Health), Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Spl. Secretary (Health), Dr Arya, Director SCI along with other senior officers from the Ministry and faculty from the Safdarjung Hospital were also present at the occasion.

                The Central TB Division of the Health Ministry has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence to explore the application of cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology in its fight against TB. The MoU was signed by Shri Vikas Sheel, Joint Secretary (HFW) and Dr P Anandan, CEO ( Wadhwani AI).

As part of the collaboration, Wadhwani AI would be supporting National TB programme become AI-ready which would include, developing, piloting, and deploying AI-based solutions. It would support the programme in vulnerability and hot-spot mapping, modelling novel methods of screening and diagnostics and enabling decision support for care-givers apart from supporting the RNTCP in adoption of other AI technologies. 

The Revised National TB Control Programme has been at the forefront of adoption of newer technologies in healthcare. Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides a unique opportunity for the health sector, bringing efficiency, saving resources and bringing accuracy in interpretation and enhancing quality of service delivery. Its use in this sector has an ample scope to improve outcomes, especially in situations where resources are limited. India is committed to ending TB by 2025, five years ahead of the Global Sustainable Development targets.

                “As health is the responsibility of all Government departments, there is a need for a ‘sub-department of health’ in all the Ministries for health impact assessment of the policies/initiatives of these Ministries right from the conceptual stages.” This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare as he presided over the MoU signing ceremony between National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and Department of Social Justice and Empowerment (DoSJE) under Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (MoSJE), here today. Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey Minister of State (HFW) and Shri Rattan Lal Kataria, Minister of State (DoSJE) along with Ms.  Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) and Ms. Nilam Sawhney, Secretary (DoSJE) were also present at the MoU signing ceremony. The MoU was signed by Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Special Secretary & Director General (NACO & RNTCP) and Smt. Upma Srivastava, Additional Secretary (DoSJE). This is the 18th such MoU with other Government departments/Ministries.

 

Emphasizing on the need for innovations and newer ideas and thoughts for taking forward the fight against HIV/AIDS, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that good quality knowledge and widespread awareness campaigns about the disease have immensely contributed to combatting it. Dr Harsh Vardhan said that this is the age of innovations and ideas and the kind of results we are expecting cannot be achieved through routine activities. “Some of the brightest ideas have come from the grassroots and it is therefore pertinent that we involve the grassroots people in all our strategy deliberations through regular brainstorming,” he stressed. He urged for synergies and alliances to be forged with various stakeholders in order to learn from their best practices. 

 

Appreciating NACO for its notable achievements, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that it is indeed commendable that NACO has worked with some of the most vulnerable people. It has played a very big role in significantly reducing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the country, and that too faster than the global rates.  He added that the impact of the programme has been significant with more than 80% decline in estimated new infections from peak of epidemic in 1995. “Similarly, estimated AIDS related death declined by 71% since its peak in 2005. As per UNAIDS 2018 report, the global average for decline in new infections and AIDS related deaths from peak has been 47% and 51% respectively,” Dr Harsh Vardhan mentioned. He further said that the Government is fully committed for meeting all the set goals to eliminate HIV/AIDS by 2030.

 

Dr Harsh Vardhan further said that this is one of the most important MoUs. It will help in developing specific strategies and action plans for HIV and AIDS prevention and mechanisms for drug addiction treatment and extending social protection schemes to the vulnerable populations. Speaking on the key deliverables of the MoU, he stated that the MoU will help in developing human resources and build capacity in order to strengthen the service delivery mechanisms for HIV & AIDS prevention, drug addiction treatment and referral to services offered by National AIDS Control Programme and DoSJE. The Union Health Minister further said that it aims at reducing incidence of social stigma and discrimination against victims of drug abuse and Children and People Living with HIV/AIDS. “It aims to promote enabling environment based on no stigma and discrimination,” Dr Harsh Vardhan added.

 

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS (HFW) said that MOUs with other Ministries are low investment and high impact initiatives that help in leveraging each other’s strength. He emphasised on enhancing awareness of the target population. 

 

Shri Rattan Lal Kataria, MoS (DoSJE) said that the MoU will help in reaching out to the marginalised groups and will provide opportunity for empowerment and access to social protection schemes by the high risk population, persons engaged in begging, People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV), and Children affected by HIV & AIDS (CABA). The Minister also appreciated MoHFW for its initiatives.

 

The MOU will catalyze in achieving the national goals and objectives of HIV prevention and impact mitigation. Through this MoU, the services of various institutes under DoSJE such as National Centre for Drug Abuse Prevention (NCDAP), National Institute of Social Defence (NISD), Integration Rehabilitation Centres for Addicts (IRCAs) will be leveraged for execution of activities laid out in the MoU.

                “We not only have to provide right food, but also ensurethat there isstrict implementation of laws and the compliance of standards to assure that citizens have safe and wholesome food.”This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare at the inauguration of the first ever state-of-the-art National Food Laboratory-Delhi, NCR of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) at Ghaziabad, here today. The Union Health Minister also laid the foundation stone of the FSSAI Tower along with the Minister of State (HFW), Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey. At the function, Dr Harsh Vardhan released a report “Food Laboratories in India: a Meta Study” and awarded Certificate of Recognition to 13 National Reference Laboratories.

Speaking at the inaugural event that also marked the 13th anniversary of the Food Authority since the Food Safety and Standards Act came into effect in 2006, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that under the visionary and inspirational leadership of our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, health has become one of the top priorities of this government and it reflects that the Prime Minister is committed to fundamentally transforming the country and give quality health services to the people.“This could be gauged from the fact that there is now a network of food testing laboratories established in the country and recognized by FSSAI. Such laboratories have increased to 261 as of now from 138 during the year 2014,” he elaborated.

Dr Harsh Vardhan further mentioned that under the guidance of our Prime Minister several pro-poor policies and schemes have been taken up and there are perceptible and measurable results in every sector. He said thatAyushmanBharat Yojana isbenefitting millions since its launch last year.  “The scheme ensures that people don’t fall below poverty line due to catastrophic hospitalization,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said. He added that with 1,50,000 Health and Wellness Centrescoming up by the year 2022, quality healthcare will reach every doorstep in the country. Similarly,the government is expanding quality tertiary health care facilities in all parts of the country, he added. With the announcement of new AIIMS, the total number of AIIMS will go up to 22, he said.

Dr Harsh Vardhan also commended FSSAI for taking the initiative to operationalise a system to approve the rapid kits and tests. This approval system, a first of its kind in terms of regulatory provisioning, would help hasten decision making by the regulatory officials and also provide a quicker means to create information base on emerging risks as well as ground realities of safety issues.  “I am glad to know that FSSAI has brought out a simple lab in a box which is named Food Safety Magic Box with a compilation of 101 easy tests. It will serve as a best pedagogical tool to educate children about the concept of safe food. The Magic Box would certainly enhance the engagement and build scientific temper to unleash creative potential among students through simple and fun experiments around food”, he stated.

On this occasion, Dr Harsh Vardhan also presented the State of Uttar Pradesh with two “Food Safety on Wheels (FSW)vans”to cater to the food testing requirements in Ghaziabad and Western UP. These mobile food-testing vans would be utilized for training and awareness-building activities as well. He stated that in near future 500 such food safety and testing vans shall be available to support the States in ensuring food safety.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS (HFW), congratulated FSSAI and stated that “This Public-Private-Partnership in the food testing ecosystem will synergize the efficiency of the private sector and the regulatory control of the Government in an efficient manner. I have full confidence in the success of this partnership and hope to see more such collaborations for other laboratories in the country.”

The National Food Laboratory (NFL), Delhi, NCR, former Food Research & Standardized Laboratory (FRSL, Ghaziabad) is one of the two premier referral laboratories under the direct administrative control of FSSAI. NFL-Delhi, NCR, renovated and operationalized under a unique Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model is the first of its kind venture in the food sector. It also houses state-of-the-art collaborative training centres namely The Food Safety Solution Centre (FSSC) and Centre for Microbiological Analysis Training (C-MAT). NFL-Delhi, NCR symbolizes synchronization of policy driven partnerships and collaboration with a holistic approach and a future vision. The NFL is furnished with a comprehensive array of equipment with the latest technologies and facilities to conduct analysis as per global accreditation standards for testing and calibration. FSSAI will also be establishing NFLs at Mumbai and Chennai in the near future along the same lines.

The FSSAI Tower situated at NFL-Delhi, NCR, has been envisaged to accommodate not only additional manpower but also host visiting faculty and trainee officers during trainings and conferences. Other facilities include a cafeteria, day-care centre, fitness centre, conference hall and training centre. This eight-floor tower with adequate parking facilities shall further augment the capabilities of FSSAI and its National Food Laboratory.

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare today wrotea letterto the Union Minister of Law and Justice, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad and the Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment,Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, seeking amendment of the existing discriminatory laws against persons affected by leprosy.“It will be a befitting tribute to the Father of the Nation on his 150th Birth Anniversary if we can expedite the process and introduction of the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons Affected by Leprosy (EDPAL) Bill, which was drafted by the Law Commission of India and annexed in its 256th Report”, Dr Harsh Vardhan wrote in his letter to the two Union Ministers.

In his letter, Dr Harsh Vardhan further wrote that “Even though the disease is now fully curable,it is disturbing to learn that there still exist 108 discriminatory laws against persons affected by leprosy including 3 Union and 105 State laws”. He stated that theNational Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) has achieved enormous success in leprosy control, particularly in the last four decades. “In addition to the routine activities, more than a dozeninnovations were introduced from 2016 onwards in a phased manner to address the issuesbeing faced by the programme. Majorly, Leprosy Case Detection Campaign (LCDC) (specific forhigh endemic districts), Focussed Leprosy Campaign (for hot spots i.e., rural and urban areas), Special plan for case detection in hard toreach areas, ASHA based Surveillance for Leprosy Suspects (ABSULS) have contributed to early casedetection. In addition, Sparsh Leprosy Awareness Campaign (SLAC) is implemented to reducestigma against persons affected by Leprosy in the community.These innovations have given the much needed impetus to the programme. Moreover, leprosy has become fully curable by Multi–Drug Therapy (MDT). This therapy is available free of cost at all the Government health care facilities in the country”.  A leprosy affected person after treatment does not transmit the disease agent. Hence, there exists no justification for the continued stigmatization of the persons affected by leprosy, Dr Harsh Vardhan stressed.

Requesting for proactively taking steps to redress this wrong, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that India is committed for justice and equality of all individuals including persons with disabilities as per the United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). He also mentioned that the target of Global Leprosy Strategy, 2016 – 2020 is to reduce the number of countries with laws allowing discrimination on the ground of leprosy to zero. 

In his letter to the Chief Ministers of 23 States/UTs (Andhra Pradesh/Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Goa/Daman & Diu, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Haryana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Assam, Maharashtra, Bihar, Puducherry, Delhi, Rajasthan and North Eastern Region and Governor of J&K), Dr Harsh Vardhan requested them to earnestly look into the matter and direct all the concerned departments/ officers to work for the amendments of the existing discriminatory laws against persons affected by leprosy. The Union Health Minister also outlined the discriminatory laws that need to be amended in the States.

                “I reviewed the situation after the fire at AIIMS yesterday. The hospital area has not been affected by the fire and there has been no loss or damage to life.” This was stated by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare after visiting the hospital and taking stock of the situation on site at AIIMS along with Director, AIIMS, New Delhi and senior faculty members today in the morning. Dr Harsh Vardhan also directed the AIIMS for conducting a comprehensive special fire audit at the Institute.

The Union Health Minister personally monitored the efforts on-site towards extinguishing the fire and patient care at AIIMS. Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that as a precautionary measure administration had shifted the patients from AB wing of the hospital to other areas of the hospital. “These patients have now been shifted back to their respective wards in the AB wing. The hospital along with the emergency department and emergency laboratories are fully functional now,” Dr Harsh Vardhan elaborated.

Being a premier specialist tertiary care Institution, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that AIIMS has a regular and well functioning fire prevention system. There are fire personnel deployed round the clock with fire fighting safety systems being regularly tested including clearance of fire exits and corridors. As a measure of abundant caution, awareness of fire fighting systems among staff is conducted regularly, he added. 

AIIMS administration has initiated an internal enquiry to look into the cause of the fire and further strengthen preventive measures. The fire which is suspected to have started from the microbiology laboratory area has affected some laboratories and office areas. 

Dr. Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS, New Delhi today held a meeting with Heads of the Departments and administrative staff to review the hospital patient care services. It was decided that outpatient (OPD) and emergency services will continue to run normally. Operation theatres (OTs) will be functional and the scheduled surgeries will be performed. A Committee has been set up to restore full functionality of services affected in PC teaching block. Additional staff has also been deployed for guiding the patients. He also reviewed the existing fire safety arrangements at AIIMS and discussed steps to further strengthen them.

                “Our responsibility doesn’t end by naming the Institute after Atal ji. We have to follow his footsteps and our commitment should reflect his inherent nature and legacy.” This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare at the inauguration of Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Medical Sciences at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, here today.

Addressing the participants, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that this initiative epitomises the political commitment, vision and guidance from our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji to not only strengthen the tertiary healthcare in the country but also ensure availability of healthcare professionals in remote areas by making medical education affordable to the people. He stated the Prime Minister is determined to achieve New India by 2022, and such initiatives will be the hallmark of that India.

Citing the examples of Polio and maternal health, the Union Health Minister said that it was Atal ji, who with his pragmatic and visionary approach envisaged the National Health Policy 2002 and launched it with the objective of achieving an acceptable standard of good health of Indian population by decentralizing public health system. “Upgrading infrastructure in existing institutions, ensuring a more equitable access to health service across the social and geographical expanse of India was one of its focus,” he said.

Dr Harsh Vardhan further said that the pro-poor scheme and innovative schemes started by Shri Atal ji helped millions.  “Atal ji took HIV/AIDS head on by establishing State AIDS Control Societies. During his regime Anti-Retroviral Therapy was started,” he mentioned.

                “The Health Ministry has drawn an ambitious plan under the 100-days agenda of the newly elected government, wherein it has been decided to provide Rotavirus vaccine to every child across all 36 states and UTs by September, 2019.” This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare while speaking on the expansion of Rotavirus vaccine to the entire country. The Union Health Minister further added that under the inspirational leadership of our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, the Government is committed to ending morbidity and mortality in children due to diarrhoea by 2022. Strengthening routine immunization is an essential investment in India’s children and will ensure a healthy future of the country, he stressed.

 

Dr Harsh Vardhan further said that Diarrhoea is one of the biggest killers in children and Rotavirus is one of the most common causes of severe diarrhoea in children less than 2 years of age. “Rotavirus vaccine along with proper sanitation, hand washing practices, ORS and zinc supplementation will go a long way in reducing the mortality and morbidity due to diarrhoea in children,” he mentioned. The Union Health Minister further added that the Government is also committed to increasing the full immunization coverage and ensuring that the benefit of the life-saving vaccines is provided to every child.

 

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that no child in the country should die from Vaccine Preventable Diseases and it is the ‘Goal and Commitment of our government’. “We stand committed to reducing child deaths and provide a healthier future to our children and the expansion of Rotavirus vaccine under UIP is a step in that direction”, he added. 

 

In India, every year 37 out of every 1000 children born are unable to celebrate their 5th birthday, and one of the major reasons for this is diarrheal deaths. Out of all the causes of diarrhoea, rotavirus is a leading cause of diarrhoea in children less than 5 years of age. It is estimated that rotavirus cause 8,72,000 hospitalizations; 32,70,000 outpatient visits and estimated 78,000 deaths annually in India. Rotavirus diarrhoea presents in similar manner like any other diarrhoea but can mainly be prevented through rotavirus vaccination. Other diarrhoea can be prevented through general measures like good hygiene, frequent hand washing, safe water and safe food consumption, exclusive breastfeeding and vitamin A supplementation. 

 

Keeping in view the burden of disease which can be prevented through vaccination, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), an expert committee, recommended introduction of rotavirus vaccine (RVV) in the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP).Three doses of rotavirus vaccine are provided along with other vaccines, free of cost under UIP at one and half month, two and half moth, and three and half month of age of child.

 

Rotavirus vaccine was introduced in 2016 in a phased manner, beginning with 4 states initially and later expanded to 7 more states making it a total of 11 states by end of 2018, where Rotavirus vaccine was available in the country. At present the vaccine has been further expanded to 17 more states till now. Rotavirus vaccine is now available in 28 States/UTs, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, Tripura, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Daman & Diu, Gujarat, Bihar, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Goa, Chandigarh, Nagaland, Delhi, Mizoram, Punjab, Uttarakhand, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 

The vaccine is expected to be available in all 36 States/UTs by September 2019.

                “Breastfeeding should not be seen as an issue that concerns only women and mothers. Let’s make the breastfeeding a shared societal responsibility where not only the mother but all in her family, community and also at work place are considerate and support the feeding mother by creating an enabling environment.” This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare at a function to mark the World Breastfeeding Week-2019, here today. Even the theme of this year of World Breastfeeding Week is ‘to empower parents, enable breastfeeding: now and for the future’, he added.  The Union Health Minister also released a Report Card on Breastfeeding & Infant & Child Feeding Practices with data from the State and UTs, along with new communication material in the presence of Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS (HFW) and Ms Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), senior officers of MoHFW, and representatives of various Development Partner agencies.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that breastfeeding is the most cost effective intervention that addresses the survive and thrive agenda of child health. It is the first vaccine that protects both the mother and child. Studies have highlighted how breastfeeding could prevent diseases and deaths in children and future breast and ovarian cancer in mothers. “Early initiation of breastfeeding within an hour of birth can prevent neonatal mortality; whereas exclusive breastfeeding for six months significantly reduces episodes of diarrhoea and pneumonia in infants and children,” he said. 

To intensify the efforts towards promotion and support of breastfeeding, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that the activities advocating benefits of breastfeeding should not be limited to only a week in August. “The activities around breastfeeding should be sustained throughout the year and therefore Health Ministry will be carrying out activities to promote breastfeeding by creating awareness about its multi-fold benefits from 1st to 7th of every month till 2022,” he stressed. The Union Health Minister further said that the Health Ministry is giving highest importance to this intervention and is already supporting the States in implementing a nationwide programme named - ‘MAA’ (Mothers’ Absolute Affection). “This involves a comprehensive set of activities on promotion and support of breastfeeding at community and facility levels, through building an enabling environment. Reinforcing lactation support services at public health facilities through trained healthcare providers and awareness generation activities at community level are also being focused,” Dr Harsh Vardhan elaborated.

Speaking about the Report Card released by him today, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that based on the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) data, this Ministry has prepared the State Specific Report Card on breastfeeding. “The best performing States as well as the best performing districts in each State have been identified. This will serve as ready reckoner for the programme managers and policy makers of the States and UTs. It will also initiate a healthy competition among the States and districts within the States”, he added.

Dr Harsh Vardhan also highlighted the importance of Deworming. He stated that the Health Ministry is conducting the ninth round of National Deworming Day (NDD) today. “This flagship single day program is implemented to reduce the prevalence of Soil-Transmitted Helminths (STH) or parasitic intestinal worms so that they are no longer a public health problem. The NDD program in this August round aims to reach 32.8 crore children and adolescents in 33 states/UTs,” the Union Health Minister elaborated.  He further said that the Ministry is hopeful to see significant participation from private schools and institutions where all children 1- 19 years old are engaged, such as technical institutes, junior colleges, poly-techniques and others. “This year the NDD is being conducted on 8th August and mop-up day on the 16th August. What we achieve in India leaves a huge impact on global burden of worm infestation by more than a quarter burden here in India,” he said.

                “The National Medical Commission Act 2019 passed by both Houses of Parliament is historic and path-breaking. It is a huge and visionary reform in the medical education sector by the NDA Government under the leadership of our visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji, and will prove to be a milestone in the years to come”. This was stated here today by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare while addressing media persons on the NMC Act 2019. The Union Health Minister further said that “I am extremely grateful to the Hon’ble Prime Minister under whose strong leadership the National Medical Commission Act has finally seen the light of the day”.

 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that the NMC Act is a progressive legislation which will reduce the burden on students, ensure probity in medical education, bring down costs of medical education, simplify procedures, help to enhance the number of medical seats in India, ensure quality education, and provide wider access to people for quality healthcare. “It is a game changing reform of transformational nature. I am sure that under the NMC, medical education in the country will attain its zenith in the years to come”.

Elaborating further, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that “Work on this Bill had commenced almost five years ago when an expert group headed by Professor Ranjit Roy Choudhury was set up to study the problems being faced in the medical education sector. This expert group found that the Medical Council of India (MCI) had failed in almost all spheres and had become a highly corrupt and ineffective body. It recommended that independent regulators selected through a transparent process should replace the elected regulators. The National Medical Commission (NMC) seeks to achieve this, by having eminent medical personalities who will be appointed for only one term of four years. They will not be eligible for any further extension. To ensure probity and integrity of the highest order, they will have to declare their assets at the time of being appointed and again while demitting office. The members will also have to declare their professional and commercial engagement or involvement which will be published on the website of the Commission. It has been further provided that Chairperson / member on ceasing to hold office will not accept for a period of two years any employment in any capacity in a private medical institution whose matter has been dealt with them either directly or indirectly”.  

Overarching body

NMC will be an overarching body, which will frame policies and co-ordinate the activities of four Autonomous Boards. These Boards will look after the work of UG and PG education, Medical Assessment and Rating; and Ethics & Medical Registration. “The purpose of having these four independent Boards is to ensure separation of functions between them”, the Union Health Minister explained. 

Student friendly 

The National Medical Commission Act is a student friendly initiative, the Health Minister stated. He added that one of the mandates of NMC is to look at the cost of medical education. It also provides for a common entrance examination for MBBS (NEET) along with common counseling for all medical institutions in the country. This provision will prevent seat blocking in parallel counseling processes and will eliminate the need for students to approach multiple colleges and take part in multiple counseling processes for admission. This will save students and their families from unnecessary physical and financial trauma.

NEXT 

Elaborating on its salient features, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that “Even in the current system, every student has to appear for a final year examination. Under the NMC Act, this final year examination has been converted into a nationwide exit test called NEXT. This single examination will grant i) a license to practice medicine, ii) an MBBS degree, and iii) entrance to postgraduate courses. Students will be able to concentrate on internship instead of spending all their time preparing for entry into PG courses and thus the burden on students will be greatly reduced. The same examination will also serve as licentiate exam for foreign graduates”.

There is a provision for common counseling for entrance to PG courses also. Students will be able to get admission to seats in all medical colleges and to Institutes of National Importance like AIIMS, PGI Chandigarh and JIPMER through a single counseling process. The Act does not impose any restriction on the number of attempts at NEXT examination.

Fees Regulation

“A singularly outstanding feature of the NMC Act is that it provides for regulation of fees and all other charges in 50% seats in private colleges as well as Deemed to be Universities. This is a welcome step in the direction of regulation of the cost of medical education”, stated Dr Harsh Vardhan. He added that there was no provision to regulate fees in the Indian Medical Council Act 1956. As a result, States had to resort to signing of MOUs with medical colleges at the time of granting Essentiality Certificate and thereby gain a handle to regulate fees of state quota seats. In view of the lack of a regulatory mechanism, the Hon’ble Supreme Court had to pass orders for setting up of fees committees in each state to be chaired by retired High Court judges. This committee decided only the fees and not the other charges levied by private colleges. Deemed to be Universities refused to submit before this committee and remained virtually unregulated, the Health Minister noted.

Nearly 50% of the total MBBS seats in the country are in government colleges, which have nominal fees. Of the remaining seats, 50% would be regulated by NMC. This means that almost 75% of total seats in the country would be available at reasonable fees. It must be stressed again at this point that not only fees, but fees and all other charges are being regulated.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that “The need to regulate fees varies from state to state depending on the number of private colleges already available. In the spirit of a vibrant and healthy federal polity, instead of the Centre abrogating the power to regulate fees for 100% of the seats available in the private sector, under this progressive Act, States have the power to take a view regarding the extent to which fee regulation needs to take place. They would now have the freedom to sign MOUs with medical colleges on the basis of mutual understanding as before. In addition, since the NMC Act has a provision for fees regulation, they will have the authority to come up with state amendments regarding regulation of fees for the remaining 50% seats”.

Community Health Providers

Elaborating on the provisions on Community Health Providers and debunking apprehensions being raised by critics of the NMC Act, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that: “We are looking at universal health coverage and more importantly, universal screening of our population for non-communicable diseases in the years to come. This requires a large number of health professionals. Doctors are a scarce resource in our country and need to be optimally utilized. They are indispensable for secondary and tertiary care; the only area where other health professionals can supplement them is preventive and primary healthcare”.

The Union Health Minister explained that as part of a pragmatic and forward looking measure in the NMC Act, in remote areas where doctors are not available, there will now be a health professional who can counsel the population, provide early warnings, treat elementary ailments, and provide early referral to a higher facility. The utility of such mid-level health providers has been confirmed by the WHO after studying their impact on healthcare in developed and developing countries. Even developed countries like USA, Canada and UK have mid-level providers like nurse practitioners, he added.

“Our rural population deserves the best healthcare facilities. We have a system of community health centres and primary health centres in rural areas based on population norms. This system is continuing and efforts are being made to fill up vacancies at such centres. Flexibility has been provided under NHM to pay higher salaries to doctors and some states are even following a policy of “you quote, we pay” to attract doctors. Facilities at rural health centres are being improved continuously under NHM”.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that “In the above background, a provision has been made in the NMC Act to register some Community Health Providers (CHPs) who shall be modern medicine professionals; they shall not be dealing with any alternative system of medicine. Also, they will have limited powers for providing primary and preventive healthcare at the mid-level”.  He further stated that the eminent doctors in NMC shall decide their qualifications through regulations which shall be finalized after extensive public consultation and debate.

Dispelling rumors, fears and apprehensions about this provision giving a fillip to quackery in the country, he stated that: “A false impression is being created that the provision for CHPs has been made to legalize quacks. Nothing can be farther from the truth. On the contrary, the punishment for quackery has been enhanced to up to one year imprisonment and up to Rs 5 lakhs fine. The so-called quacks in the country do not possess any qualifications and would not be able to meet the conditions that will be set by NMC for becoming a CHP”, Dr Harsh Vardhan explained.

NMC members

Elaborating further on some of the concerns voiced regarding the NMC Act, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that “There are some apprehensions about NMC being dominated by central government nominees. This is not true. There will be 10 Vice Chancellors of State Health Universities and 9 elected members of State Medical Councils in the NMC. Thus 19 out of 33 members, which is more than half of the total strength, would be from the States and only a minority of members will be appointed by the central government thereby ensuring that the NMC is representative, inclusive and respecting the federal structure of Indian polity”.

	Clause 32: Limited License to practice at Mid-level as Community Health Provider:


India has a doctor-population ratio of 1:1456 as compared with the WHO standards of 1:1000. In addition, there is a huge skew in the distribution of doctors working in the Urban and Rural areas with the urban to rural doctor density ratio being 3.8:1. Consequently, most of our rural and poor population is denied good quality care leaving them in the clutches of quacks. It is worth noting that at present 57.3% of personnel currently practicing allopathic medicine does not have a medical qualification.        

The ambitious Ayushman Bharat initiative announced by GoI in this year’s Budget Speech needs 1,50,000mid-level providers within the next 3-5 years to provide comprehensive primary and preventive care.It will take 7-8 years to ramp up the supply of doctors, therefore, in the interim we have no option but to rely upon a cadre of specially trained mid-level providers who can lead the Health and Wellness Centres. 

There are international examples of Health Systems permitting such Community Health workers. Countries such as Thailand, United Kingdom, China, and even New York have permitted Community Health Workers/Nurse Practitioners into mainstream health services, with improved health outcomes. Since we haveshortage of doctors and specialists, the task shifting to Mid- level Provider will relieve the overburdened specialists. This is merely an enabling provision to grant limited licence only in primary and preventive healthcare to practice medicine at mid-level to such persons, who qualify such criteria as may be specified by regulations which will have an overwhelming representation of Doctors. Chhattisgarh and Assam have experimented with the Community Health Workers. As per independent evaluations (carried out by Harvard School of Public Health), they have performed very well and there is no ground of concern if the quality of personnel is regulated tightly.


	Clause 15: NEXT Exam


Medical Education (ME) is a specialized area with high focus on technical skill sets. A common final year undergraduate examination (NEXT) withcommon standards of knowledge and skills for Doctors on a Nation-wide basis.

An enabling provision has been made to ensure common standards. Regulations for operationalizing the NEXT would be made in due course keeping in mind importance of both theoretical as well as clinical skill setsrequired at the level of UG. Composition of NMC includes 75% doctors representing Central and States Institutions/Councils and health universities. Such a composition of NMC will ensure that due weightage to theoretical as well as clinical skill sets is adhered to. There is a 3 year window before NEXT becomes operational, leaving ample scope for detailed negotiations on the contours of the exam.


	Clause 10(1) (i): Fee regulation


IMC Act, 1956 has no provision for regulation of fees. As a result, some states regulate the fees of some seats in private colleges through MoUs signed with college managements. In addition, the Supreme Court has set up committees chaired by retired High Court Judges to fix fees in private colleges as an interim measure. Deemed to be Universities claim that they are not covered by these committees.

Nearly 50% of the total MBBS seats in the country are in government colleges, which have nominal fees. Of the remaining seats, 50% would be regulated by NMC. This means that almost 75% of total seats in the country would be available at reasonable fees.  In the spirit of federalism, the State governments would still have the liberty to decide fees for remaining seats in private medical colleges on the basis of individual MOUs signed with colleges on the basis of mutual agreement. 

States also have been providing scholarships on the basis of merit cum means and would normally continue to do so in order to make medical education affordable to all students. We need to balance the interests of the poor but meritorious students and the promoters of the private medical colleges in order to expand the number of seats on offer. It is not correct to assume that colleges would be free to arbitrarily raise the fees for unregulated seats. The transparency provided by NEXT results would lead to regulation of fees through market forces. Colleges would have to provide quality of education commensurate to the fees charged by them, otherwise there would be no takers for their management quota seats.

Rating would be provided by MARB for medical institutions based on the standard of education/training.  This will serve to regulate fee through market forces.

Any affirmative action has to meet the test of reasonability. India has a large middle class population. The government of the day is duty bound to create infrastructure for all segments of society.

While we solicit private investment in the medical education sector and want private medical colleges to be financially viable, this government has not shied away from its responsibility to create more seats in the government sector. We have invested more than Rs 10,000 crores in creating government seats in the past five years, and are also setting up 21 new AIIMS at a cost of over Rs 30,000 crores to boost the medical education sector. This trend of creating government seats will continue in future.

There is no question of NMC Bill making medical education a preserve of the rich. On the contrary, it is common knowledge that before the reforms of NEET and common counseling were introduced by our government, rich students who could afford to pay huge and unrecorded capitation fees were able to secure admission to private medical colleges. Our reforms have eliminated the role of black money in medical education and the NMC Bill will provide statutory force to the reforms which have been carried out.

Another bogey which is being raised is that merit will be given a go by in the proposed dispensation. Nothing could be further from the truth. The earlier provision was that any student who obtains 50% marks at class 12 level could gain admission to MBBS courses. Colleges negotiated with students and conducted their own admission tests in a totally non-transparent manner. As a result, many undeserving students got admission. Now only NEET qualified students can get admission, which ensures that merit prevails in admissions.

                The Department of Heavy Industry has approved the sanction of 5595 electric buses to 64 Cities, State Government Entities,State Transport Undertakings (STUs)for intra-city and intercity operationunder FAME India scheme phase II in order to give a further push to clean mobility in public transportation.

The Department had invited the Expression of Interest (EoI) from million-plus cities, smart cities, State/UT capitals and cities from special category states for submission of proposal for deployment of electric buses on operational cost basis.

Eight six proposals from 26 States/UTs for the deployment of 14988 e-Buses were received. After evaluation of these proposals as per EoI, on the advice of Project Implementation and Sanctioning Committee (PISC) the Government sanctioned 5095 electric buses to 64 Cities / State Transport Corporations for intra-city operation, 400 electric buses for intercity operation and 100 electric buses for last mile connectivity to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).

Each selected City/STUsis required to initiate the procurement process in a time bound manner for deployment of sanctioned electric buses on operational cost basis. As per EoI, buses which satisfy required localization level and technical eligibility notified under FAME India scheme phase II will be eligible for funding under FAME India scheme phase II.

These buses will run about 4 billion kilometers during their contract period and are expected to save cumulatively about 1.2 billion liters of fuel over the contract period, which will result into avoidance of 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 emission.

                Secretary General, INTERPOL, Mr. Jürgen Stock, called on Union Home Minister, Shri Amit Shah, in New Delhi today. He thanked Shri Shah for the commitment shown and cooperation extended and assured best support of INTERPOL for the fight against terror. He also conveyed that the three focus areas of INTERPOL are counter terrorism, organised & emerging crime and cyber crime. 

During the meeting, Shri Shah proposed hosting of INTERPOL General Assembly in New Delhi in the year 2022, as part of celebrations of the 75th Anniversary of Indian Independence. He also expressed India’s willingness to be a Regional Hub of INTERPOL Global Academy by extending assistance as well as infrastructural support.

While in conversation with Mr. Stock, the Home Minister emphasised the zero tolerance approach of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi to Drug Trafficking, International Terrorism, Dirty Money and Money Laundering. He called upon INTERPOL to accord top most priority in fighting these menaces. Shri Shah also underlined the urgent need for a long term strategic action plan in fighting these menaces not just in Asian region but across the world.

Shri Shah conveyed that over the years, Indian Intelligence and Investigation Agencies have acquired rich and varied experience in their decades old fight against terrorism. INTERPOL is welcome to actively collaborate with Indian Law Enforcement Agencies to make best use of this expertise. He also mentioned the recent amendments in UAPA.

The Home Minister expressed concern about the delay in publication of Red Notices and an urgent need for proactive pre-publication consultation for ensuring expeditious publication of Red Notices. He conveyed that such cooperation enables India to more intensely pursue high profile fugitive economic offenders and terrorists.

Mr. Stock appraised the Home Minister about the databases of INTERPOL that house 100 million records, secure global data communication channel (I-24/7) and other tools through which INTERPOL is assisting Law Enforcement Agencies across the world. He desired that Indian Law enforcement Agencies may make efforts to ensure more extensive use of INTERPOL’s tools and databases, more particularly at Border Control Points. Mr. Stock also assured enhanced operational cooperation.

                Some foreign nationals, who are already in India on valid visas, were facing difficulties in taking medical treatment in the event of their falling sick during their stay in India. They were being advised by some hospitals to get their visas converted into medical visas before admitting them in hospitals/medical centers.

The Government of India had already revised the procedure last year, which exempts foreigners from getting their primary visa converted into medical visa for obtaining indoor treatment up to 180 days for seeking admission in a hospital wing owing to illness. Now, the Government of India has further liberalized the Medical Visa regime and permitted foreigners to get the indoor treatment on their primary (original) visa even for pre-existing diseases (except in cases of organ transplant) which the foreigner may have been suffering from even before his/her entry into India. So now:

1. A foreigner suffering from a minor medical condition, which needs only OPD consultation/treatment, may take treatment at any hospital/treatment centre on his/her primary visa.

2. I case of indoor medical treatment of less than 180 days or up to the stay stipulation period, if any, stipulated on primary visa of a foreigner or the duration of his/her primary visa, whichever is earlier, a foreigner is permitted to take such indoor medical treatment subject to certain conditions.

3. The indoor treatment may now be taken on primary (original) visa irrespective of the fact that the diseases, which the foreigner may have been suffering from even before his/her entry into India and even for ailments which were in his/her knowledge.

4. Treatment of diseases, which require organ transplant shall, however, be permitted only on a Medical Visa.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs graced the 7th Convocation of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU) today at Gandhinagar as Chief Guest. He told the students that life is full of possibilities, and only those with courage could make most of those opportunities. He urged the graduating students to never aim for less and always be ambitious in their goals, and do the best they could in the new chapter of their lives.

He called PDPU as the then Gujarat Chief Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s dream project, and said that through sheer hard work and will, within 12 years the institute has established its name as one of the best higher education institutes of the country. He said that it was Shri Narendra Modi’s dream to see Gujarat as the nation’s petrol capital.

Speaking on Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, Shri Shah explained the concept of integral humanism and said that Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay was a great thinker who saw the problems of today’s world more than six decades ago and found solutions for the same. He said that the coming age was that of global warming and climate change, and those issues would become increasingly important. He noted that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had provided leadership at global level to tackle the issue of climate change.

Shri Shah urged PDPU to undertake research and development in recycling of single use plastic and asked the institute to innovate in the field of eco-friendly plastic. He remarked that more than 5,000 graduates passed out of the institute in the last twelve years were a great asset to the nation.

Shri Shah said that in 2014, people put their faith in the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi and brought a decisive government with full majority in power. The result of this faith has been seen in the last five years as the nation has been transformed in many ways. 

Today India has strong macroeconomic fundamentals, is the fastest growing economy and has reduced fiscal deficit from 5% of GDP to 3.3% of GDP. He said that from 142 in 2014, India had achieved a World Bank Ease of Doing Business Rank of 77 in 2019. He spoke of India’s improved World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index of 71 to 58. He noted Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s goal of making India one of the world’s three largest economies by 2022, and that of making India a 5 trillion dollar economy. He urged the graduates to take this era of transformations forward. He said that decisions like GST have proven that Shri Narendra Modi takes decisions not to please people but to improve their lives and develop the nation.

He noted that while there were only 3000 startups from independence to 2014, today there are more than 20,000 startups, providing our youth opportunities to be globally competitive. He spoke of the surgical strikes and the Balakot airstrikes and said that the strong, bold leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has ensured that no adversary would think of harming India. He said the challenges of Articles 370 and 35A were solved by the iron will and resolute leadership of Shri Narendra Modi. Shri Shah expressed confidence that under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi, Kashmir and Kashmiris would prosper and be able to avail hitherto inaccessible opportunities.

Calling for the development of oil and gas and energy sectors, Shri Shah said that the government had taken several initiatives to develop the sectors, such as the new Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP), but still more needs to be done. Shri Shah remarked that while India comprised of 18% of the world’s population, its energy consumption is only 5.4% of the global energy consumption, which proved that the per capita energy consumption in India is quite low. He said that petroleum and energy sectors would play a vital role in making India a 5 trillion dollar economy.

Shri Shah urged the students to rise above the narrow confines of self and family, and work for the nation, and said that this would present them with endless possibilities for growth. He said that the coming year is the 150th Birth Year Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, and it would bring new energy, new inspiration and new resolutions for the nation. He asked the graduating students to study the lives and deeds of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and Mahatma Gandhi to understand India.

Also present were Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Vijaybhai Rupani, other leaders and dignitaries.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval for the Establishment of an International Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) along with its supporting Secretariat Office in New Delhi. The proposal was approved by the Prime Minister on 13th August, 2019.

The CDRI is proposed to be launched at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, USA on 23rd September 2019. Organized by the UN Secretary General, this event will bring together the largest number of Heads of States to generate commitments for combating the effects of climate change and resulting disasters, and will provide the high-level visibility required for the CDRI.

The approval, inter-alia, is for the following initiatives:


	Establishment of the International ‘C.D.R.I.’ along with its supporting Secretariat office in New Delhi;



	Establishment of the Secretariat of the CDRI as a Society under The Societies Registration Act,1860 in New Delhi as ‘CDRI Society’ or similar name as per availability. The memorandum of association and by-laws of the ‘CDRI Society’ will be prepared and finalized by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in due course;
	In-principle approval for Government of India support of Rs. 480 crore (approx. USD 70 million) to CDRI for a corpus required to fund technical assistance and research projects on an on-going basis, setting up the Secretariat office and covering recurring expenditures over a period of 5 years from 2019-20 to 2023-24; and



	The endorsed version of the Charter document that will act as the founding document of the CDRI. The charter will be finalized after taking inputs from potential member countries by the NDMA in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs.


Major Impact:

The CDRI will serve as a platform where knowledge is generated and exchanged on different aspects of disaster and climate resilience of infrastructure. It will bring together technical expertise from a multitude of stakeholders. In doing so, it will create a mechanism to assist countries to upgrade their capacities and practices, with regard to infrastructure development in accordance with their risk context and economic needs.

This initiative will benefit all sections of society. Economically weaker sections of society, women and children, are the most vulnerable to the impacts of disasters and hence, will be benefitted from the improvement of knowledge and practice in creating disaster resilient infrastructure. It will also benefit all areas with high disaster risk. In India, the north-eastern and Himalayan regions are prone to earthquakes, coastal areas to cyclones and tsunamis and central peninsular region to droughts.

Innovation:

          There are many initiatives on different aspects of disaster risk reduction and many initiatives on infrastructure development in different in a range of countries with different disaster risk and development contexts.

          A global coalition for disaster resilient infrastructure would address concerns that are common to developing and developed countries, small and large economies, countries at early and advanced stages of infrastructure development, and countries that have moderate or high disaster risk. Few concrete initiatives work at the intersection of Sendai Framework, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Climate Change Adaptation with a focus on infrastructure. Focus on disaster resilient infrastructure would simultaneously address the loss reduction targets under the Sendai Framework, address a number of SDGs and also contribute to climate change adaptation. Hence, there is a clear niche for a Global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.

          Publication of natural hazard risk information about the different regions in India will allow the public to understand the risk in their regions and demand for risk mitigation and preparedness measures from their local and State Governments.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah, today presided over the 49th Foundation Day of Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) as Chief Guest in New Delhi. Minister of State Shri G. Kishan Reddy graced the occasion as the Guest of Honour.

Shri Shah congratulated the past and serving officers of the organization for effectively contributing in research and development and modernization of police forces. Shri Shah observed that to maintain the relevance of an institution for 50 years is no mean feat, and BPRD has done a commendable task of providing vital inputs to police reforms and training.

Shri Shah noted that maintenance of internal peace and a stable law and order system are essential requirements for achieving Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision to make India a 5 trillion dollar economy. He highlighted the role of a modern and robust police force as an essential one in development, and the role of BPRD as a national police think tank. 

Shri Shah emphasized on institutionalizing efficient systems and best policing practices so that they become a part of nature to all law enforcement officials, and said that every officer from a constable to a DGP should have clarity about their roles. This can only be achieved through meticulous training, here the role of BPRD becomes essential.

Commenting on the changing role of police from British era to today, Shri Shah said that while earlier the primary function of police was to maintain the stability of the British empire, Sardar Patel brought forth a new paradigm for Indian police system after independence. Today the primary objective of police is to serve people and protect their rights.

Shri Shah emphasized the need for police modernization in a changing era filled with new challenges. He also remembered the 34,800 police personnel who laid their lives in the line of duty to keep India safe from internal security threats.

Shri Shah said that police reforms is a continuously evolving, never-ending process with changing society and newer challenges. He also differentiated between police reforms and reforms in policing, and urged BPRD to take lead in the latter field, involving a paradigm shift in the approach to policing. Shri Shah said that for reforms in policing, a complete transformation of mindset is essential, and only a citizen friendly, responsive, forward looking and accountable police force would lead the way in positioning India in top 3 global economies. He reiterated that internal security of the country is directly proportional to high quality research and inputs for policy formulation at BPRD.

Shri Shah called for a countrywide consultative process to make changes in IPC and CrPC and encouraged BPRD to play a leadership role in it. Shri Shah also called for National Police University and Forensic Science University to be established, with affiliated colleges in every state. He opined that this would help create skilled manpower needed to tackle complex cases requiring advanced forensic science capabilities. He also noted the growing gap between demand and supply of forensic science skills in the country.

Commenting on prison reforms, Shri Shah said that the job of prisons should be not to punish but to deter and reform. The approach of prisons should be to create good citizens, he said.

Shri Shah expounded on the need for old systems to adapt with changing times and revamp policing techniques to meet the needs of the day. He also urged BPRD to be more proactive and expand its area of operations.

Shri Shah unveiled the Golden Jubilee Logo of BPRD in the function. He also distributed Union Home Minister’s Medal for Excellence in Police Training and Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant Puraskar for Hindi Writing.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State Shri G. Kishan Reddy enumerated the challenges in front of Indian police: terrorism, left wing extremism, crime and challenging law and order situations. He urged BPRD to develop procedures and technology so that crime can be preempted and stopped. He focused on the concept of training the trainers, and urged police to develop domain expertise. He flagged cybercime as an emerging challenge, and spoke of the newly established women safety wing in the Ministry of Home Affairs. He expressed confidence in the emergence of a strong India under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

Also present on the occasion were Union Home Secretary Shri Ajay Kumar Bhalla, DG, BPRD and other senior officers.

                Addressing the review meeting on Left Wing Extremism (LWE) at New Delhi today, Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah said that LWE is one of the major internal security challenges faced by the Nation for the last several decades. Left Wing Extremism has no place in Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s Vision of ‘New India’, he added. Several Union Ministers including Finance Minister, Ministers for Road Transport & Highways, Agriculture, Rural Development, Panchayati Raj, Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Tribal Affairs, MoS Home Affairs, along with Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh attended the meeting and senior officials of Central and State Governments.

Shri Shah observed that LWE organizations are against democratic institutions and use violence to subvert the democratic process at ground level. They actively seek to prevent development in the least developed regions of the country. Their strategy is to misguide people and keep them ignorant. Shri Shah noted that the basis of the PM’s vision of ‘New India’ is the strength of holistic, last-mile development, and it is therefore essential to get rid of the menace of LWE violence. Shri Shah asserted that India’s fight against those who try to subvert democracy with violence would continue relentlessly.

Noting the success of security forces against LWE violence, Shri Shah said that the last few years have seen a decline in number of districts that saw LWE incidents, and the number of incidents as well. From the high 2258 events of LWE violence in 2009, the events have come down to 833 in 2018. The number of deaths dropped from 1005 in 2009 to 240 in 2018. From 96 districts affected by naxal violence in 2010, the number of districts affected was reduced to 60 in 2018. 

Shri Shah observed that states play a key role in maintaining law and order, therefore, a synergy between the centre and states can effectively address the issue of LWE. Though incidents of LWE violence have come down, focus needs to be kept to eliminate it completely and all efforts need to be maintained by Centre and states in full pace, he added.

Shri Shah also elaborated the multidimensional strategy followed by the centre in this regard which includes use of advanced technology, sharing intelligence, raising of 66 Indian Reserve Battalions (IRBs) by the centre etc. He emphasized on capacity building of local forces, since it is strong local forces that can effectively neutralize LWE organizations from their areas. In this regard, Shri Shah said that LWE cannot be eradicated without the vigilance and efficiency of the local police in the militancy affected states, hence their role is important. He asked the states to use central schemes and their own budget for police modernization.

The Home Minister also focused on the need to check flow of funds to LWE organizations, and praised the states for the steps taken by them in this regard. Shri Shah also called upon the states to rationalize their surrender policy to mainstream innocent individuals caught in the trap of LWE violence. 

Shri Shah said that apart from the flagship schemes of various ministries, specific initiatives have been taken by the Central Government for areas affected by LWE, which mainly include improving road and telecom connectivity, financial inclusion, skill development and education. He specifically talked about accelerating the pace of opening up of schools under Eklavya model as well as ensuring the presence of banking facilities within 5 kms to all citizens.

The Union Home Minister assured the State Governments that the Centre would cooperate fully in eliminating LWE. He said that the time has come for the security forces to formulate a proactive strategy to deal with the issue and it is necessary to prevent LWE incidents at all costs. Shri Shah said innovative measures need to be employed to prevent IED (Improvised Explosive Device) incidents that have caused significant number of casualties in recent years. 

Talking about the National strategy to counter LWE formed in 2015, Shri Shah said that it was a multipronged approach consisting of security, development and ensuring participatory governance and rights for local tribals, inter alia. He said that under this strategy, the protection of the rights of local citizens is the priority. Shri Shah urged the states to adopt a focused, time-bound approach to completely eliminate LWE and ensure all-round development of affected regions.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah has expressed profound sorrow at the passing away of Former Cabinet Minister Shri Arun Jaitley, today. He said, “I am deeply saddened by the untimely demise of Shri Arun Jaitley. His passing away is a personal loss for me. I have lost not only a senior leader of the organization but also an integral member of the family, whose support and guidance I have been receiving for years. Today his departure has brought a void in the country's politics and the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is not possible to be replenished soon”.

The Home Minister further said, “With his unique experience and rare ability, Arun ji served various responsibilities in the party and the government. A brilliant orator and dedicated activist, he held important positions like the country's Finance Minister, Defence Minister and Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha”.

“Arunji has left an indelible mark as the Finance Minister of the country during the NDA Government's 2014-19 tenure by implementing Prime Minister's vision for welfare of the poor on ground and placing India as the world's fastest growing economy. He was a people-oriented person and always thought for the welfare of the common man. His every decision reflects this quality - be it the matter of taking action on black money or of realizing the dream of 'GST – One Nation, One Tax' or be it demonetization. The country will always remember him for his very simple and sensitive personality”, Shri Amit Shah said.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah presided over the Passing out Parade (PoP) of the 70th Batch of Indian Police Service (IPS) Probationers at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA), in Hyderabad today. The event was also graced by Governor of Telangana, Shri E. S. L. Narasimhan and Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy, along with senior officers and family members of the probationers.

During the PoP ceremony, the Home Minister inspected the parade and awarded the best performing probationers, amongst a total of 103 officers that included 15 lady officers, 6 Royal Bhutan Police and 5 Nepal Police Service officers. Shri Shah congratulated all the probationary officers, especially the lady officers, and gave best wishes for their bright careers.
He expressed pride that the young officers would soon be joining the distinguished tradition of Indian Police Service in serving the Nation with utmost dedication.

Saluting the ‘Iron Man of India’, Shri Shah said that this academy is established in Hyderabad, a place that saw a historic police action under the leadership of Shri Vallabhbhai Patel in 1948 that resulted in the merger of the erstwhile Hyderabad state into the Indian union. He paid tributes to Sardar Patel for integrating over 600 princely states and giving shape to the Indian Union. The Home Minister stated that the only state that remained from truly integrating into the Indian union was Jammu & Kashmir (JK). It has also now been integrated by the bold step taken by Government of India under the decisive leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi by abrogating Article 370. Today, Sardar Patel’s vision of a unified India has been realized in true spirit, he added.
Addressing the probationers, Shri Shah said that the IPS was envisioned as the forbearers of preventing corruption in India by Sardar Patel. He stated, “Your aim must not end by getting selected in Civil Services, but the path to make India free from corruption and become safe and secure from external and internal threats, starts from here on. The future would present a lot of challenges and hardships. You are becoming a part of the legacy of those 33000 officers who have laid down their lives in service of the Nation. You have to always work dedicatedly to ensure security and integrity of India. You would have to remember the oath taken here today and keep treading on the path of committed service to the Nation all your life. Your life must be dedicated to uplifting the lives of thousands of fellow citizens who have not got this opportunity”. 

Motivating the young probationers to become team leaders and lead from the front by example, Shri Shah said, “Sampark (Connect), Samvaad (Communicate) aur Samanvay (Coordinate) are the core principles of team building and achieve success in challenging situations”. He emphasized on reaching the people, communicating constantly and building a connect, in order to serve them in the most successful manner. Shri Shah gave the example of his own political career and how he has been able to successfully build a connect with the grassroots and serve the people of the country. He said politicians only get elected for five years but civil servants get the opportunity to serve the country for whole life, which must not be wasted.  Being free from fear and taking decisions for the betterment of masses, while abiding by the tenets of the Constitution, is the hallmark of an officer and only by following this principle can one become a successful police officer, he added.
Shri Shah stated, “Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi has given a vision of a SMART Police (S - Sensitive and Strict; M - Modern with mobility; A - Alert and Accountable; R - Reliable and Responsive; T - Trained and Techno-savvy). The police forces must continuously remodel on this vision to successfully face the challenges in the future”. Further, he stated that PM's vision of a 5 trillion dollar economy can only be achieved when the law and order situation in the country is stable and peaceful. A SMART police force is the flag bearer of achieving PM’s vision of a 5 trillion dollar economy, he added. 

Concluding his address, the Home Minister expressed confidence that all probationers would maintain the high traditions of the police services and dedicate their lives to the service of the Nation. He also saluted the sacrifices of the parents of the probationers for giving the Nation the new batch of dedicated police officers.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah chaired the 24th meeting of the Western Zonal Council at Panaji (Goa) today. Other Dignitaries attending the meeting included Chief Minister Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupani, CM Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis, CM Goa, Dr. Pramod Sawant and Administrator of the Union Territories of Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Shri Praful Patel and senior officers from the Central and State Governments. 

Addressing the meeting, Shri Shah welcomed all the members of the Council to the 24th meeting and hoped that this would be a fruitful meeting where all the issues having Centre-State and inter-State ramifications will be resolved with consensus.  He stressed that after due deliberations, unequivocal decisions taken by consensus should be resolved to further strengthen the federal structure of the country.  

The Home Minister stated that the West Zone has been instrumental in giving impetus to the Indian economy as the States of the Zone are contributing around 24% to the GDP and 45% to the total exports of the country.  Hence, all the pending issues between the States and the Centre need to be resolved on priority through the medium of Western Zonal Council.  He further lauded the States in the Zone for excellent work and for being harbingers in the cooperative sector.  The States in Zone have been a big exporter of sugar, cotton, groundnut and fish and contributing immensely to the economic development of the country.  

Shri Shah hoped that today’s meeting would be decisive and fruitful in resolving the issues listed in the agenda.  He stated that besides the issues listed in the agenda, he would also like to add and discuss issues relating to law & order and administrative reforms so that this Council meeting is helpful in giving further pace to the development of the country.  

The Home Minister expressed his deep concern for the flood victims in the States of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa and requested the States to quickly assess the damage caused by the floods and send their requirement to Government of India. He also mentioned that the Government of India has taken an initiative to assess the damage on its own, for which Central teams have already been constituted to visit the flood affected areas without waiting for the reports from the States.

The Council reviewed the progress of implementation of the recommendations made at the last meeting. The Council among others focused on the following issues:


	Action on the Master Plan submitted by Maharashtra Government for utilization of surplus Salt Pan Land for rehabilitation of slum dwellers was discussed at length.  State Government will send a detailed proposal in two months suggesting broad contours of a transparent financial model for involvement of slum dwellers (and utilization of remaining land as per high FSI in keeping with provisions of a scheme to be formulated as per Slum Rehabilitation Act) on competitive basis for rehabilitation of slum dwellers & transfer of land/monetization for Government of India. 
	Coverage of all villages which have hitherto remained without any banking facilities within 5 km radial distance by a Bank/India Post Payments Service. This data derived from GIS platform of NIC will be further corroborated by the States using road distance on the ground. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) should also be done through IPPBs also everywhere as these are covered by Core Banking Solution. Shri Shah underlined the need for systemic reforms instead of merely chasing the statistics. 
	Enhancement of DBT Portal to include scheme/village-wise details by collecting real time information from respective portals of beneficiary-oriented schemes to give village level DBT fund transfer & benefits.
	Innovative solution of encrypted QR Code on Aadhaar card for verifying antecedents of marine fishermen. States to get the print-outs taken or cards made within a month at Government initiative, so that everyone has Aadhaar card with latest QR Code and foreign national don’t enter Indian territory unauthorizedly through fishing boats.
	Detailed monitoring mechanism to ensure that investigation and trial of sexual offences/rape against girls below 12 years of age are completed within two months (POCSO Act and Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018] each. Chief Secretary must personally monitor periodically adherence to legal provisions of completing investigation & trial within two months.


The Home Minister also called upon the States to give their suggestions for improvements in Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code. He urged the Chief Ministers to ensure regular monitoring at the Chief Secretary’s level of investigation and prosecution of cases in the courts in case of heinous offences such as Narcotics, POCSO Act, murders etc. For this purpose, the States should fill the post of Director Prosecution without any further delay. 

Shri Shah further pointed out that the Government has zero tolerance towards offence under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Forensic Science Labs also need to be strengthened to ensure accurate investigation and high conviction.  He stressed on the need for setting up Forensic Science Laboratories in the States also. There should also be regular monitoring of all decisions in various areas narrated above through Video Conference by Home Secretary and Special Secretary, Inter-State Council Sectretariat. 

CM, Goa welcomed the guests and assured his full cooperation in resolving all pending issues. CM, Gujarat stated that his experience with the Zonal Council had been very nice as almost all the issues pertaining to them had been resolved in the past. 

CM, Maharashtra welcomed the decision taken by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister regarding removal of Article 370 and 35A of the Constitution in respect of the State of Jammu & Kashmir.  He also emphasised that this decision would pave the way for development of J&K and Ladakh and integration of this part with the rest of the country.  The Chief Ministers of Goa & Gujarat and Administrator of Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli also endorsed and supported the views of CM, Maharashtra. 

The five Zonal Councils - Western, Eastern, Northern, Southern and Central - were set up under the States Reorganization Act, 1956 to foster Inter-State co-operation and co-ordination among the States. The Zonal Councils are mandated to discuss and make recommendations on any matter of common interest in the field of economic and social planning, border disputes, linguistic minorities or inter-State transport etc. They are regional fora of cooperative endeavor for States linked with each other economically, politically and culturally. Being compact high-level bodies, specially meant for looking after the interests of respective Zones, they are capable of focusing attention on specific issues taking into account regional factors, while keeping the national perspective in view. 

The deliberations of the Council were warm and cordial, in the true spirit of cooperative federalism and ended with the decision to host the next meeting in Maharashtra.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah reviewed the issues related to final publication of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, on August 19, 2019. The review meeting was attended by the Chief Minister of Assam, Union Home Secretary, Chief Secretary Assam and senior officers. Extensive deliberations have been held on the issue between the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the state government of Assam in recent weeks.

It was decided that adequate arrangements will be made by the State government to provide full opportunity to the persons whose names have been excluded from the final NRC to appeal against their non-inclusion. Every individual, whose name does not figure in the final NRC, can represent his/her case in front of the appellate authority i.e. Foreigner Tribunals (FT). Under the provisions of Foreigners Act 1946 and Foreigners (Tribunals) Order 1964, only Foreigners Tribunals are empowered to declare a person as a foreigner. Thus, non-inclusion of a person’s name in NRC does not by itself amount to him/her being declared as a foreigner.

State government has agreed to set up adequate number of such tribunals at convenient locations. It has been decided that state government would also make arrangements to provide legal aid to the needy people amongst those excluded from NRC.

As it may not be possible for all those excluded from final NRC to file the appeal within the prescribed time, MHA will amend the rules to increase the present time limit of filing of appeals in FTs from 60 days to 120 days regarding exclusion from final NRC. The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 are also being amended accordingly.

In order to maintain law and order situation, central armed paramilitary forces are being provided for deployment as per assessment of the State government.

                The High Level Committee (HLC), chaired by the Union Minister for Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah, met in New Delhi on 19th August 2019 to consider additional central assistance to three states, which were affected by drought (rabi) of 2018-19, avalanches, hailstorms, landslides and cyclone ‘Fani’ during 2019.

The HLC approved additional central assistance of Rs. 4432.10 crore to three States from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) - Rs. 3338.22 crore to Odisha for Cyclone Fani, Rs 1029.39 crore to Karnataka for drought and Rs 64.49 crore to Himachal Pradesh for avalanches and hailstorm.

Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar were present in the meeting, along with senior officers of the Ministries of Home Affairs, Finance, Agriculture and NITI Aayog.

This additional assisatance is over and above the funds released by Centre to the States in the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at the disposal of States. During 2018-19, Centre had released Rs 9,658 crore to all states and during 2019-20, till date Centre has released Rs 6,104 crore to 24 States from SDRF.

In the case of Odisha at the onset of Cyclone ‘Fani’, Rs 340.87 crore was released in advance on 29th April 2019 from SDRF. Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi visited Odisha on 06.05.2019, and as announced by him, immediate assistance of Rs. 1000 crore was released in advance. In addition, an ex-gratia sum of Rs. 2 lakh were provided to next of the kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 to seriously injured in the Cyclone from PM’s Relief Fund.

During Cyclone ‘Fani’, Central Government had deployed 71 teams of NDRF, 19 columns of Army, 09 Engineering Task Force (ETF), 27 aircraft/helicopters and 16 Ships of Armed Forces for relief and rescue operations. During this massive evacuation drive, more than 15.5 lakhs people were evacuated. Central Governmnet had provided all necessary assistance in restoration of power supply and communication in affected districts, including that of providing necessary stores, gensets, steel poles and skilled manpower etc. As other states were also likely to be affected, an amount of Rs 688 crore was released in advance from SDRF to State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.

HLC also reviewed the existing practice of deputing an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) after the receipt of Memorandum from the State in the wake of any severe calamity. In a significant decision taken by the Union Home Minister, IMCT will henceforth be constituted immediately in the aftermath of any natural calamity of severe nature, which will visit the affected areas in the State so as to have first hand assessment of damages caused and relief work carried out by the State administration. IMCT will again visit the state after submission of the Memorandum for detailed assessment of the damages and relief operations conducted for making final recommendations for allocation of additional funds. At present IMCT visits the affected state only once after the receipt of memorandum from the state.

In line with this decision, Ministry of Home Affairs will immediately constitute and depute IMCTs to States of Assam, Meghalya, Tripura, Bihar, Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala affected by recent floods.

HLC also reviewed the ongoing flood situation in different parts of the country and the logistic support provided by central agencies including deployment of NDRF and Defence forces. In the combined rescue operations in the states affected by floods, landslides etc. during the current monsoon season, NDRF, Army, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard have evacuated and rescued more than 1,53,000 people. The flood situation in the country has been continuously monitored by Union Home Minister. 

Shri Shah directed the senior officers to continue to take every possible measure to deal with the situation arising out of South-West Monsoon in the concerned states and to extend all necessary assistance to the flood affected states.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah said that overall development of North East region is the priority of the Government. He said that the country is proud of its culture and the aim is to take forward North East while preserving its rich cultural identity, along with its development. The development of the region has curbed terrorism and brought peace in the region. He was addressing at the foundation stone laying ceremony of Karbi Bhawan and Dimasa Bhawan of Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council, Diphu and North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council, Haflong, at Dwarka, here today. 

Shri Amit Shah said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given maximum time to the people of North East for their development. After 40 years of visit by Shri Morarji Desai, the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi chaired the North Eastern Council (NEC) meeting in Shillong, as Prime Minister. He added that North East region lagged behind in development for many years, which gained momentum after the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi took charge. The north east is now well connected via roads, rail and air, he said. Shri Amit Shah said that this change is due to the love and respect for North East in the heart of our Prime Minister. He said that the practice of Central Ministers visiting North Eastern states every 15 days has been adopted by the Government, where they see the implementation of Central schemes on ground. 

Speaking about the enhanced fund allocation for North east, Shri Shah said that there has been 258 % rise in the funds allocated for North East between 13th and 14th Finance Commissions, with amount rising from Rs 87,000 crore to Rs 3,13,375 crore. He mentioned about various schemes for North east such as Skill Development centre, setting up of Medical College and  Law College, among others. He further said that DoNER Ministry has started work for setting up of 'Bamboo Industrial Park' in Assam. Emphasising on the rich flora and medicinal value of plants of NE, the Home Minister said that the DoNER Ministry should set up a Research and Development Centre for medicinal plants in these bhawan, which will help in exploring the potential of these values. 

Speaking about the Karbi Bhawan and Dimaa Bhawan, Shri Shah said that these two bhawans will be constructed with a cost of Rs 130 crore and they will give an identity to their unique culture on the world map. He said that with this initiative, a long pending work which was initiated in the year 2011, has now been completed. He added that these bhawans will help youth from North East to understand the world which will enable them to compete with the world. The Union Home Minister said that this is the responsibility of the Government to take the development schemes to the tribal population of the country. The aim of the Government is overall development, prosperity and peace in North East. 

The MoS (DoNER) Dr Jitendra Singh congratulated the people of North East on the occasion. He said that the work which has been pending for years, has now been completed with the foundation stone laying by the Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah today. The Minister said that the land for the bhawans was transferred by DDA in June this year. Speaking about the initiatives taken by the Government in the last five years, the Minister said that the focus of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, after taking charge in 2014, was to develop the hitherto neglected areas and bring them at par with other regions.

Dr Singh said that the Prime Minister has paid more than 30 visits to the North East in the last five years, which reflects the importance given by him to the North East and his commitment for its development. In 2016, the PM himself chaired meeting of NEC in Shillong, he said. The minister said that the focus has been not to bring North East closer to rest of India, but to bring rest of India closer to North East. He added that the decision was taken to set up a ‘camp secretariat’ every month in North East and this initiative was named 'DoNER at doorsteps'. He also spoke about North East road sector development scheme and train connectivity. He also mentioned about the Sikkim Airport. He said that a venture fund has been created by DoNER Ministry for the benefit of start-ups in North east, where youth can utilize their entrepreneurship skills. The DoNER Minister said that North-east will soon become a favourite destination and role model for whole India. 

The Chief Minister of Assam, Shri Sarbanada Sonowal, the Assam Finance Minister, Shri Himanta Biswa Sarma, MPs & MLAs and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah addressed an audience on ""Abolition of Triple Talaq - correction of a historic wrong"" at the Constitution Club of India earlier today.

Tracing the journey of the Act, Shri Shah said that he had spoken on the issue of Triple Talaq when it was in the ordinance format and when it was a bill. He said that it was a proud moment for him to speak of the issue of Triple Talaq when it had finally been enacted by the Parliament. 

Blaming the policy of appeasement for the opposition to the removal of Triple Talaq, he said that while removal of social evils is generally welcomed by society, it was appeasement that led to some opposition to the move.

Shri Shah asserted that social unity and holistic development are hampered because of appeasement. He said that development of an entire society takes hard work and rigorous planning, and requires dedication, commitment and empathy. Calling appeasement a ""shortcut"", he said that appeasement never leads to development.

Shri Shah said that those who are left behind in the journey of development must be empowered, and that holistic, all-encompassing, last-mile development is the philosophy of the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

Giving the examples of nations that had abolished Triple Talaq, Shri Shah said that several Islamic nations had already taken the step decades ago, and this proves that such a barbaric practice is not part of Islamic culture.

Praising the tenacity and decisiveness of the government, Shri Shah said that the road to ending Triple Talaq was not easy, as the Bill was not able to pass through Rajya Sabha multiple times. However, the government persisted with the passage of the Bill and was ultimately successful. 

Commenting on the Constitutional Status of the issue, Shri Shah said that a five judge Constitution Bench had pronounced with a majority of 3-2 that the practice of Triple Talaq violates Article 14 of the Constitution - Equality before the law and equal protection of the law. Thus, Supreme Court itself has declared the practice of Triple Talaq to be illegal, unconstitutional, arbitrary and void. 

Shri Shah said that a soicety must progress with time, otherwise it becomes stale. He also said that the abolition of Triple Talaq would ensure dignity and equality for crores of Muslim women. 

Commenting on the aspect of imprisonment for the violation of the Act, Shri Shah remarked that the correction of many social evils required the application of criminal laws - from Sati Pratha and child marriages to polygamy and dowry.

Regarding the maintenance of the aggrieved wife and children, Shri Shah said that the husband will be required to provide for the wife he divorces through Triple Talaq, as well as their children.

Shri Shah said that the law stipulates 3 years of imprisonment for violators, and bail is possible only after the aggrieved woman has had a chance to present her side to the court. Thus, this law empowers Muslim women in the truest sense of the word. Commenting on the results of a survey, Shri Shah said that 92.1% Muslim women wanted Triple Talaq gone.

He said that he was proud of having voted against ending the social evil of Triple Talaq.

Shri Shah observed that nepotism, casteism and appeasement have collectively damaged the nation's polity, and emphasized that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the government had taken steps to remove all three from India's polity.

Shri Shah stated that with the passage of the Act, the Prime Minister's promise to the nation stands fulfilled. He also said that the world looks up to India with respect because of this move. 

He remarked that great social reformers like Raja Rammohan Roy, Jyotiba Phule, Kavi Narmad Mahatma Gandhi, Veer savarkar and Dr Ambedkar have all contributed to uplifting our society and removing social evils. He said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's name would find a place in the list of great social reformers because of his leadership in the quest for abolishing the practice of Triple Talaq. 

Hailing the Prime Minister for the decision, Shri Shah said that the journey of the nation towards development must not stop here. He emphasized that the nation must function not on nepotism, casteism or appeasement, but on merit.

                Addressing a public rally in Jind, Haryana; Union Minister for Home Affairs Shri AMit Shah said that with the removal of Article 370, the Government has fulfilled Sardar Patel’s dream of a united India. This was a step that previous governments did not take, but now, with this step taken, Kashmir becomes an integral part of India. Shri Shah said that the Government of the day has fulfilled the dream of former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji with the abrogation of Article 370.

 

He also said that the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A is a big step forward for the unity and integrity of India. Moreover, this step has removed all obstacles in the path of holistic development of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Shri Shah emphasized that such a courageous step can be taken only by those who think in terms of national interest. Shri Shah praised the removal of Article 370 by 370 votes as a historic one by the Parliament.

 

Focusing on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji’s announcement of the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff, Shri Shah said that the creation of the post will ensure greater synergy among forces. He hailed the decision as a force multiplier for India’s armed forces.

 

Shri Shah further praised PM-KISAN scheme, which provides minimum income support up to ₹6,000 per year to all farmers. He also applauded the Government’s pension scheme for small retail traders as an unprecedented step. Speaking on the newly created Jal Shakti Mantralaya, Shri Shah said that the creation of such a ministry will harmonize and coordinate all efforts for water conservation and water resource augmentation.

 

Praising the Haryana Government’s successful efforts to reverse the decline in sex ratio, Shri Shah said that Shri Manhoar Lal Khattar Government’s successful implementation of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has led to an increase in the state’s sex ratio from 871 to 918 in three years. Shri Shah commended the Haryana Government for ensuring increased remuneration for ASHA and aanganwadi workers. He also hailed the government’s decision to increase remuneration to the families of martyrs from rupees 20 lakh to 50 lakh. He congratulated Shri Khattar for ensuring 24x7 state-wide availability of electricity and the successful implementation of the policy of providing two times the MSP to farmers.

                The Cabinet expresses profound sorrow at the sad demise of Smt. Sushma Swaraj, former Union Cabinet Minister in the night of 06th August, 2019 at AIIMS. New Delhi. In her passing away, the country has lost a distinguished leader and an outstanding parliamentarian.

The following is the text of the Resolution:-

“Born on February 14, 1952 at Ambala in Haryana, Smt. Sushma Swaraj graduated from Sanatan Dharma College, Ambala Cantt. and obtained Bachelor of Law degree from Punjab University, Chandigarh. She was also conferred Honorary Doctorate by the Agriculture University, Kanpur. In 1973, she started practice as an advocate in the Supreme Court of India.

Smt. Sushma Swaraj entered public life at a young age and won election to the Haryana Legislative Assembly at the age of 25 years in 1977 and became Cabinet Minister for Labour and Employment in the State Government of Haryana. She was again elected as a member of Haryana Legislative Assembly and became the Cabinet Minister for Education, Food and Civil Supplies during the period 1987 to 1990.

In 1990, she was elected to the Rajya Sabha and in 1996, as a member of the 11th Lok Sabha when she became the Union Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting. In 1998, she was again elected to the 12th Lok Sabha and held the portfolio of Union Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting and also for Telecommunications as an additional charge. In October, 1998, she became the first woman Chief Minister of Delhi. Thereafter, in April, 2000, she was again elected to the Rajya Sabha and became the Minister for Information and Broadcasting from September, 2000 to January 2003 and then the Minister for Health and Family Welfare and Parliamentary Affairs from January 2003 to May 2004.

In 2014, she was elected to the 16th Lok Sabha. She served as Union Cabinet Minister for External Affairs from May, 2014 till May, 2019.          

Smt. Sushma Swaraj will always be remembered for her exceptional oratorial skills and a compassionate approach. She was an able administrator and an affable person with humane touch who won the hearts of all by helping Indians in distress abroad. For these qualities, she was declared as ""India's best loved politician"" by the US daily 'Wall Street Journal' in 2017.

The Cabinet places on record its appreciation of Smt. Sushma Swaraj's services to the Nation in different capacities. The Cabinet also extends its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family on behalf of the Government and the entire nation.”

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah launched the book ‘Listening, Learning and Leading’ in Chennai today. This book is based on Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu’s two years in office. The book captures glimpses of the Vice President’s 330 public engagements across the country during this period.

Talking about the book and his experiences from Life, Shri Naidu said that this book gives a glimpse of his life after assuming the office of the Vice President of India. He said, “I have retired from politics, but not tired of public life. Learn, Learn and Learn, then Earn. Even after you start earning, do not stop learning.” One must have conviction and commitment to what one does, connection with grassroots, patience to be successful in life and a zeal to bring a change in other peoples’ lives, he said.

Shri Naidu complimented the leadership and conviction of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi led government for the repealing of the Article 370. “It was the need of the Hour and was due for long”, he said while reading out a news article from 1964, quoting a demand from MPs in Parliament for the same. Shri Naidu also laid forth his views on reform measures in various fields that are required to bring effective governance in the country.

Talking about the venue of the event, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said, “I have special love for the State of Tamil Nadu. The State is an important part of India. Tamil Nadu has been the leader of the cultural developments in the country and I have no hesitation in saying that I wanted this function to be hosted in Chennai. I am Vice President of the whole country, not only Delhi. The country includes North, South, East and West.” In his address, Shri Naidu also said that there should be no opposition to any language, but no language should be forcibly imposed on anyone. Everyone must give priority to their mother tongue, while showing an inclination to learn other languages as well.

Addressing the event, Shri Amit Shah said, “I have come here not as a Minister, not as an MP, not as a party president. I have come here as a student of politics, in honor of the personification of an ideal politician and leader, that is Shri Venkaiah Naidu. The book, ‘Listening, Learning and Leading’, is nothing but the story of his life and is an ideal for the youth of the country to follow. This has been exemplified in his conduct throughout his life, from a son of a farmer to the Vice President of India and Chairman of the Upper House of the Parliament. It is his dedication and untiring service for the Nation that has helped him to become a role model for the whole country, Shri Shah said. 

The Home Minister talked about the immense contribution of Shri Naidu towards his political party and the Government while he held various Ministerial portfolios in the NDA Government. Shri Shah mentioned that the concept of Smart Cities and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana were launched during Shri Naidu’s tenure as the Urban Development Minister and how they are transforming the Indian urban landscape. The Home Minister added that even after becoming the Vice President, he has been as active as ever and has been continuously in touch with grassroots and has provided his guidance through his extensive speeches inside and outside Parliament. Being from agricultural background, Shri Naidu’s interactions with farmers across the country and his contribution to shaping the agricultural policy of India is commendable. 

Further, Shri Shah noted that Shri Naidu has been active in getting India’s message communicated to the world by meeting visiting foreign delegations and visiting 19 Nations in the last two years, of which some countries have been the first ones that were visited by an Indian Vice President. The Home Minister said that the book is an example of how a leader needs to communicate with the masses of the Nation. It is for future leaders in all fields to tread the footsteps shown by Shri Naidu.

Shri Shah further noted that it is an auspicious happening that the young Shri Naidu who participated in movement against Article 370 in his youth, was the Chairman of the Upper House when the resolution was passed. He said, “I had no confusion in my mind as Home Minister of India on what would happen after Article 370 is abrogated. I am confident that Jammu and Kashmir would progress on the path of development and prosperity. Yet while introducing the resolution on Article 370 in the Upper House, I had apprehensions on how the House would function, as the Government does not have majority in Rajya Sabha”. Commending him for his neutrality and leadership during the discussion in Rajya Sabha on Article 370, Shri Shah congratulated Shri Naidu for his exceptional leadership in conducting the proceedings of the House, maintaining the decorum of the House and getting the resolutions and bills regarding J&K passed.

The Event was graced by the Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit, Union Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Environment, Forests & Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri Edappadi K. Palanisamy, Deputy Chief Minister, Tamil Nadu, Shri O. Panneerselvam, eminent scientists like Prof M.S Swaminathan, Dr. K. Kasturirangan and Members of Parliament from various parties, among other dignitaries.

                The Seventh meeting of the India-Bangladesh Home Minister Level Talks (HMLT) was held in New Delhi on 07 August 2019. The HMLT was co-chaired by Shri Amit Shah, Home Minister of India and Mr. Asaduzzaman Khan, Minister for Home Affairs of Bangladesh.

Home Minister congratulated the visiting dignitary on his resumption of the office as Home Minister of Bangladesh for a second term, and reiterated India’s full support for Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s development agenda. Both the Ministers reiterated the significance attached to the bilateral relationship, which is forged in the 1971 Liberation War, which goes far beyond a strategic partnership. Today, our ties are a role model for good neighbourly relations across the world. They are rooted in history, culture, language and shared values of democracy, secularism, development cooperation and countless other commonalities. 

During the meeting, the Ministers expressed satisfaction that both countries are working closer than ever before in every sector, including security and border management. They reiterated their commitment to keep the borders friendly, and in this regard appreciated the close co-operation between their border guarding forces. Home Minister appreciated Bangladesh’s policy of not allowing use of its territory by extremists and insurgents for perpetrating violence in other countries including India.

The gamut of issues related to bilateral security co-operation were discussed during the meeting. Both the Home Ministers reaffirmed the need to further curb the menace of trans-border crimes, and therefore agreed to the need for greater co-operation to achieve our aim of a secure border. Both sides also reviewed the pending issues related to security and infrastructure at the borders, and agreed to take steps towards the expedited resolution of these matters. Home Minister Shri Amit Shah also raised India’s concern regarding the illicit movement of undocumented persons across the border, with a view to find solutions to this problem especially in North East India. 

The Indian Home Minister assured the Home Minister of Bangladesh of India’s continuing support for safe and speedy repatriation of the displaced Myanmar citizens sheltered in Bangladesh, for whom India has provided humanitarian assistance in four tranches since September 2017. 

The leaders also looked forward to enhancing cooperation in simplifying people to people contact and travel for business, health and tourism, including through promoting connectivity.

                A day-long NHRC National Level Review Meeting on Mental Health concluded at India International centre, New Delhi today highlighting several issues to bridge the gap between the legislation and its implementation. Earlier, inaugurating it, the NHRC Chairperson, Mr. Justice H.L. Dattu said that the efforts to improve the mental health care in the country have been made but a huge gap still remains between the requirements and availability of facilities in the sector.

Flagging it as a matter of serious concern for the Commission, he said that consistent with its policy to monitor the mental health sector, it felt necessary to evaluate the ground realities post implementation of Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. Justice Dattu said that there is a requirement of 13500 psychiatrists but only 3827 are available. Against the requirement of 20250 clinical psychologists only 898 are available. Similarly, there is an acute shortage of para– medical staff also.

The NHRC Chairperson also raised the issue of prisoners having mental health problems and said that the protection of the rights of such prisoners is an obligation of the State governments under Section 103 of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 as also emphasized by the Supreme Court in one of its recent judgments.

Ms. Preeti Sudan, Union Health & Family Welfare Secretary said that the Centre has been very proactively engaged with the task of improving the mental healthcare system in the country for which the cooperation of States is also needed. She said that the funds are not the impediments but the States have to come forward with their proposals to implement the imperatives of Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 also submit timely reports on their expenditure for the same.

Earlier, Mr. Sanjeeva Kumar, Special Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and Mr Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare echoed the similar views. Mr. Kumar said that only 19 States have implemented the Mental Healthcare Act so far. He said that 10.6 percent adult population in the country suffers from mental health issues, which is a huge number requiring holistic concept of safety nets, legal frameworks and medical care facilities. He lauded the NHRC for its efforts in bringing different stakeholders to discuss the subject and improve the situation through collaborative approach.

Mr. Jaideep Govind, Secretary General, NHRC giving an overview of the Commission’s several engagements with reference to the mental health said that it forms part of development goal 3 which emphasizes well being of all. He said that some states have introduced good practices which need to be replicated by others. He also said that the Commission has expanded its outreach by providing various alternative ways of filing complaints with the Commission. This included linking of NHRC’s online complaint filing system with over three lakh Common Service Centres in the country.

Post discussions, the NHRC Member, Mr. Justice P. C. Pant, in his concluding remarks, expressed the hope that the suggestions will go a long way in bridging the gap between the legislation and its implementation. He said that it is expected that the State governments would make concerted efforts to improve the mental healthcare.

Besides the NHRC Member, Mr. Justice P. C. Pant, Secretary General, Mr. Jaideep Govind and Joint Secretary, Mr. Dilip Kumar and other officers, Special Rapporteurs and Special Monitors, the participants included other representatives of the concerned Union Ministries, State Governments, State Human Rights Commissions, Medical Council of India, Nursing Council of India, Directors of Mental Health Institutes, Mental Health Experts, NGOs and civil society organizations.

                The NHRC Chairperson, Mr. Justice H.L. Dattu today said that the efforts to improve the mental health care in the country have been made but a huge gap still remains between the requirements and availability of facilities in the sector. He was inaugurating a day-long NHRC National Level Review Meeting on Mental Health at India International centre, New Delhi today. Flagging it as a matter of serious concern for the Commission, he said that consistent with its policy to monitor the mental health sector, it felt necessary to evaluate the ground realities post implementation of Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. Justice Dattu said that there is a requirement of 13500 psychiatrists but only 3827 are available. Against the requirement of 20250 clinical psychologists only 898 are available. Similarly, there is an acute shortage of para– medical staff also.

The NHRC Chairperson also raised the issue of prisoners having mental health problems and said that the protection of the rights of such prisoners is an obligation of the State governments under Section 103 of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 as also emphasized by the Supreme Court in one of its recent judgments.

Mr. Sanjeeva Kumar, Special Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare emphasising the need for more active participation of all the stake holders highlighted the efforts made by the centre towards improvement in the mental healthcare. He said that only 19 States have implemented the Mental Healthcare Act so far. He said that 10.6 percent adult population in the country suffers from mental health issues, which is a huge number requiring holistic concept of safety nets, legal frameworks and medical care facilities. He lauded the NHRC for its efforts in bringing different stakeholders to discuss the subject and improve the situation through collaborative approach.

Earlier, Mr. Jaideep Govind, Secretary General, NHRC giving an overview of the Commission’s several engagements with reference to the mental health said that it forms part of development goal 3 which emphasises well being of all. He said that some states have introduced good practices which need to be replicated by others.

Besides the NHRC Member, Mr. Justice P. C. Pant, Secretary General, Mr. Jaideep Govind and Joint Secretary, Mr. Dilip Kumar and other officers, the participants include the Union Health Secretary, Ms. Preeti Sudan other representatives of the concerned Union Ministries, State Governments, State Human Rights Commissions, Medical Council of India, Nursing Council of India, Directors of Mental Health Institutes, Mental Health Experts, NGOs and civil society organizations.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah, introduced two bills and two resolutions regarding Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) in Lok Sabha today. These are as follows:


	Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order, 2019 {Ref. Article 370(1) of Constitution of India} – issued by President of India to supersede the 1954 order related to Article 370.
	Resolution for Repeal of Article 370 of the Constitution of India {Ref. Article 370 (3)}
	Jammu & Kashmir (Reorganisation) Bill, 2019 {Ref. Article 3 of Constitution of India}
	Jammu & Kashmir Reservation (2nd Amendment) Bill, 2019 {Home Minister withdrew the Bill from both Houses as the provisions of this act would become applicable to J&K once article 370 gets repealed and the laws of Union of India become applicable there}


Article 370(3) provides President of India has the powers to amend or repeal the article by issuing a notification, based on a recommendation of Constituent Assembly of J&K. President of India signed the Constitution Order 2019 yesterday regarding Article 370(1), under which all the provision under article 4 would be applicable to J&K. J&K constituent assembly would be read as J&K Legislative Assembly. Similar changes to article 370 have been done in the past as well.Now since President’s rule is in force in the state, implementation of article 370 would cease to exist when President of India issues the notification in this regard, after this House passes the resolution.

Replying to the debate, Shri Shah stated,""I want to state that J&K is an inalienable part of India. There are no two versions about that”.Parliament is the highest and fully competent bodyto make laws and bring resolutions regarding a state of India including J&K. There can be no question to this power of the Parliament. Shri Shah said that for 70 years, people of India have harboured this aspiration in their hearts that Kashmir must be an integral part of India. Article 370 was the only roadblock to realize this goal. Home Minister thanked the Prime Minister for this historic step to remove this roadblock for ever.

Leader of Main Opposition Party in Lok Sabha raised the issue of how the Centre can take this step unilaterally when Kashmir is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan and when the matter is pending in UN.
To this, Shri Shah retaliated and challenged the opposition that they must clarify their stand on the floor of the House whether they support UN meditation in Kashmir.The opposition in a way has questioned the competence of the Parliament by raising this point, he stated.

Shri Shah asked the members, “How can patriots of India who can sacrifice their lives for the country not get perturbed by such a question?”In India, things do not function on whims and fancies but on laws. I am always ready for constructive discussion but never for destructive debate, he added.

Speaking on the applicability of United Nations charter on India and Pakistan to J&K, Shri Shah said thatunder this charter, neither armed forces would violate the territorial integrity of other country. The day in 1965 Pakistan violated this provision, the charter was violated. The question of a referendum ended with the Pakistani aggression. Hence, the Government of India has full rights to take any decision regarding its territorial integrity. This was even agreed to by the UN, Home Minister added.

Shri Shah reminded the opposition and asked who took Kashmir matter to UN and who brought a unilateral cease fire in 1948? “Had our forces given a free hand to deal with the situation, PoK would have been a part of India today”, he stated.

Introducing the resolutions and bills on the floor of the House, Shri Shah said that the House has been witness to many historical moments. Today once again this House is witness to a golden day when we are going to bring J&K truely into India's fold.Now, local representatives would have a voice in the hill councils. The governments would be democratically elected and would run the local government and administration in J&K.

Several members have raised the apprehension about the period for which the Union Territory status will continue for J&K. Shri Shah saidthat regarding Ladakh, it wasa long standing demand. Further he said, “I want to assure the people of J&K that the status of State would be restored once the situation normalises. Secondly, PoK and Aksai Chin are an inalienable part of JK and the seats are still part of the legislature.J&K would have a Legislative Assembly with elected representatives and it is a misnomer that the administration would be run by the Centre, he assured the House.

Home Minister explained the difference between articles 370 and 371. Article 370 was originally a temporary provision. He informed that because of article 370, the laws of Union of India did not apply to J&K, corruption and terrorism flourished there. Article 371 relates to special provisions to special clauses favouring development to backward regions in some states. Why would the Government repeal article 371 and why is the opposition equating articles 370 and 371, he asked. Home Minister assured the people of these states that this Government has no intention of repealing article 371.Further, Shri Shah also classified that Naga Accord and article 370 have no relation and no mistake committed in the past would not be repeated by this Government.

Regarding troop deployment and no internet facilities in J&K currently, Shri Shah assured that there is no reason other than preventing some nefarious elements from instigating violence in the State and no one can stop the government to take precautionary measures to protect the peace inside the country. He made it clear that the government would never talk with separatist elements and those who back cross border terrorism. The government would only talk with anyone once they are committed for peace and development in J&K.

Taking on the opposition about the division of erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh, the Home Minister said that the proposal was rejected by the State Assembly by two-thirds majority. Even then the earlier Government went ahead with the division without consulting all political parties.

Removing article 370 has no communal agenda as a number of communities and religious groups are resident of J&K that are affected equally. Article 370 has perpetuated discrimination against the minorities including Sikhs, Buddhists admin others. Further, Shri Shah said, in the past 70 years over 41500 people have been killed. Should we continue on the same path and let people die. Who is responsible for this state of affairs? Are not the youth of J&K and Ladakh require development. For how long would we deprive them only for vote bank politics. Repealing article 370 is not a historic blunder, rather it is historic step to correct this historic blunder. Such bold steps are not taken for vote bank but for the betterment of people of J&K and for three Nation, Home Minister stated.

Shri Shah further said that those who favour article 370 are in opposition to the Prevention of Child Marriage Act which could not be applied to J&K due to article 370. Similarly other laws like Right to Education, Land Accusation Act, Multiple Disability Act, Senior Citizens act, Delimitation act, Whistle Blower Protection act, laws enacted for empowerment of tribals, National Commission for Minorities, National Council for Teacher Education, among others, could not be applied to J&K.
How is this in favour of the people of JK to not apply these laws in the state, Home Minister asked the House. The reason, he said, is simply that after President's rule was applied in J&K, all corruption cases were opened and those who were at the receiving end are opposing the repealing of article 370. Democracy was strangulated by the use of article 370 for 70 years. Today, after this government came to power, over 40000 panch and sarpanches are taking the democratic process forward and development has started.

Taking on the cross border terrorism, Shri Shah stated that Pakistan has misused the presence of article 370 to sow the seeds of separatism and terrorism in J&K. I appeal to all those who favour article 370, to ponder what benefits did the provision bring to the state. It only prevented development and facilitated terrorism there. Only by repealing this provision, we can bring the people to the mainstream and embrace them with open arms.J&K is the heaven on earth and I assure everyone that it would continue to remain so when all the laws of Union of India become applicable to the state, he said.

The Home Minister appealed to the House to once again ponder on all these points and join hands with the Government to bring the people of J&K in the mainstream of development.

Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah, introduced two bills and two resolutions regarding Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) today. These are as follows:

 


	Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order, 2019 {Ref. Article 370(1) of Constitution of India} – issued by President of India to supersede the 1954 order related to Article 370.
	Resolution for Repeal of Article 370 of the Constitution of India {Ref. Article 370 (3)}
	Jammu & Kashmir (Reorganisation) Bill, 2019 {Ref. Article 3 of Constitution of India}
	Jammu & Kashmir Reservation (2nd Amendment) Bill, 2019


 

Announcing a path breaking decision by the Government, Shri Shah said that the Government is moving a resolution which would repeal the provisions under Article 370 of the Constitution of India,which granted a special status to the state of J&K. The provisions of Article 370 would cease to exist from the date President of India issues a notification in this regard, after the recommendation of the Parliament. Consequently, the Constitution of India would get applicable to J&K, on par with other states/UTs of the country, the Minister added.

 

Responding to apprehensions on the resolution and the future of J&K,Shri Shah said,“I would just say that the bill that the Government is bringing is historic. Article 370 has prevented J&K to merge with India rather than being a basis of its merger. The politics of vote bank has looted the youth of the state for over 70 years. I would call on the opposition members to debate and discuss on why the benefits of development were not allowed to reach the common people of J&K till now. Politics of religion must be avoided at all costs. Article 370 is equally harmful for people of all religions”, the Minister said.

 

Further, the Minister termed the provisions of Article 370 as discriminatory on the basis of gender, class, caste and place of origin. The youth is being taken for a ride by the political elite. This provision was temporary in the first place and it has to go in the larger interest of the people of J&K, he added.

 

Under article 370(3), there is a provision that President, on recommendation of the Parliament, has the power to amend or cease the implementation of article 370,through a public notification. This has already happened on a number of occasions in the past. The Home Minister pointed out to the opposition that everyone knows how the article 370 is hampering the development of the people of the state. 


Shri Shah said that post the repeal of the Article 370, doors to private investment in J&K would be opened, which would in turn increase the potential for development there. Increased investments would lead to increased job creation and further betterment of socio-economic infrastructure in the state. Opening of buying of lands would bring in investments from private individuals and multinational companies and give a boost to the local economy, as opposed to the apprehensions raised by those opposing this historic step, he added.

 

Home Minister remembered the martyrdom of civilians and soldiers who have lost their lives during 1989-2018. He said that had article 370 would not been there, these people wouldn't have lost their lives. Refugees who came from Pakistan after partition did not get citizenship till now. They cannot become councillors in the state. This has been a historical injustice to these people. As opposed to this, in rest of India two Prime Ministers were elected from those refugees.

 

Shri Shah said because of article 370, democracy never took root in J&K, corruption flourished, widespread poverty took root and no socio-economic infrastructure could come up. It is the root cause of terrorism. Further, 73rdand 74thAmendments to the Constitution could not be applied to J&K due to article 370. Panchayat and Nagar Palika elections could not be held. Who is responsible for taking away democratic rights of the people of J&K which were available to other citizens of India? It was Article 370.Panchayat elections recently held were conducted successfully and peacefully. The people want democracy and not bloodshed., the Minister said.

 

Talking about economic backwardness in J&K, Shri Shah said article 370 impedes people from outside the state to do business there. Absence of economic competition has prevented development and corruption flourished.Land prices are at a rock bottom because no one can buy land there. No industry, including tourism, is allowed to flourish there. People remain poor in perpetuity despite presence of abundant economic opportunities for the local populace. Rampant corruption is present, thus preventing external investment in the state.

 

Home Minister said, “I want to tell the Kashmiri youth that article 370 holds no benefits for them. It would only benefit a few elite people who want to keep the youth poor for ever and corner all benefits for themselves. Despite so much funds being provided by the Centre, where are the educational and health facilities? Those who support article 370 must know that this article prevents professionals from outside the state to settle down in the state and hence no one wants to go there. Now, the moment this resolution is passed and article 370 is removed, each child would get right of education and each patient would get free health care under Ayushman Bharat.”

 

Further addressing the Kashmiri youth, Home Minister said, “We want to embrace the youth of J&K and give them flourishing opportunities of employment. Even the separate bill for reservation for economically backward classes would not be required if the resolution is passed in both houses as the provision will get automatically applied to J&K, as in rest of India”. 

 

Talking about terrorism, Shri Shah said that the youth has been misguided to pursue jihad on Pakistan's nefarious designs. Thousands of civilians have died. Why? It has been a stated policy of Pakistan to support article 370 and keep the youth away from getting into the mainstream of development and brain wash them into jihad. All the political parties with separatist ideology have vested interests to continue article 370. Their children do not get killed in the blood shed caused due to terrorism, hence support the article.

 

Rebutting the apprehension that removing article 370 would destroy Kashmiri culture, Shri Shah said that all states have preserved their culture and language after becoming a part of the Union of India. How does article 370 protect JK on this aspect, he asked. It is only and only a political propaganda that has blinded the youth of Kashmir into believing it for 70 years.“I assure the youth of JK that give this government 5 year and it will become the most progressive region in the country”, the Minister said.

 

Daughters of the state marrying outside the state lose their rights to property. It is so discriminatory to the women and their children. SC and ST people have been discriminated against and have been deprived of reservation to political offices. Despite knowing this a few people have been perpetuating this article only for their political gains, the Minister said.

 

Shri Shah assured the House that if the Union Territory model works well, our government would also consider giving J&K the status of state again. No constitutional amendment would be required.

 

J&K would become a true part of India in letter and spirit once article 370 is removed. The path to solution to all the problems of Kashmir goes through the repealing of article 370. This step would stand strong and would pass the test of legal scrutiny. Article 370was a temporary and transient provision, it had to go. It only required political will, which only the present government had. “I give a heartfelt appeal to all political parties to rise above political considerations to join hand with the government to remove article 370. The country wants this united as one”, the Minister concluded, after which all the resolutions and bills relating to J&K were passed.

 

Shri Amit Shah also introduced the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganisation) Bill, 2019 making Jammu & Kashmir a Union territory with a Legislative Assembly,along with Union Territory status to Ladakh without a Legislative Assembly. Further, the Jammu & Kashmir Reservation (2nd Amendment) Bill, 2019 to amend the Jammu & Kashmir Reservation Act 2004 was also introduced. This bill seeks to extend the 10% quota to economically weaker sections of society in J&K in jobs and educational institutions. Both the bills were passed by Rajya Sabha unanimously.

                A one-day Workshop on ‘Role of Technology in Reuniting Missing Children & Trafficked Persons’ was jointly organised by National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, in collaboration with Indian Police Foundation on 5th August, 2019. Shri K. V. Eapen, Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, inaugurated the workshop. He highlighted the increased use of biometrics by police around the world and emphasized the need to use of advance technologies to aid investigation by police.  The keynote address was delivered by Prof. Nishchal Verma, IIT Kanpur, an eminent resource person in the area of Biometrics, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. 

The workshop deliberated on the use of biometrics by law enforcement agencies for the identification of persons.  Use of biometrics is not a new practice in law enforcement; however, it was not as technologically advanced as present day applications.  Rise of computing and electronics have greatly assisted biometric applications to become faster, more secure and accurate.  Use of biometrics has become a necessity in today’s complex world.

Shri Vivek Gogia Joint Director, NCRB, spelt out the vision and future projects of the Bureau and welcomed the Chief Guest and participants. In his welcome speech, he highlighted the need for accurate identification and evidences that provide irrefutable evidence of criminal activities.  The efficiency of law enforcement agencies has become much more enhanced with the inception of biometrics. It was emphasized that with the use of biometrics, law enforcement agencies can also locate large number of persons, especially children who are reported missing.  Similarly, unidentified found persons and unidentified dead bodies can also be matched using biometrics with the existing records of missing persons and unidentified found persons.  In a large population, it is the only mechanism to provide an accurate match and help people in reuniting with their families.

First brainstorming session about Emerging Technologies in identification, was chaired by Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri, IIT Kanpur. Shri Amit Sharma, Advisor (Cyber), Ministry of Defence;  Prof. Prabaharan, Amrita University, Kerala and Prof. Bappaditya from Great Lakes Institute of Management, Gurugram, were present as panellists.  They highlighted use of facial recognition technology for various applications, stressing upon importance of identifying tools which would greatly facilitate the investigation of crime and detection of criminals and provide information for easier and faster analysis for reuniting missing children and trafficked persons.  In the afternoon session, experiences in the applications of identification technology were discussed under the chairmanship of Shri Ramachandran, President and CEO, Indian Police Foundation (IPF). Shri Ravi Gupta, ADGP (TS), Telangana,; Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, IIIT Delhi and Shri Pavan Duggal, Sr. lawyer of Supreme Court of India, were present as panellists.

Delivering concluding remarks, Shri Sanjay Mathur, Joint Director (CCTNS), NCRB clarified the doubts related to security breach, reliability and privacy of individuals while implementing AFRS (Automated Facial Recognition System).   He informed that AFRS of NCRB will not work on public databases.  Its scope is to use CCTNS database which is secured and not available in public domain.  AFRS will be a tool to aid investigating officer as part of CCTNS application.  At present the Investigation Officer manually compares the photographs maintained in Police Station in the form of albums & dossier of offenders involved in previous cases with that of suspects/accused in the case under investigations.  AFRS automates this matching process and provides a bigger set for comparison, as it will be run on state/national level CCTNS/ICJS database.  AFRS results will be further corroborated and analysed by collecting other evidences by Investigation Officer before drawing any conclusions.  AFRS will not source facial images from CCTV cameras in public places, unless the video footage is part of scene of crime.

                Rajya Sabha passed the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2019 today. Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah, replying to the debate on the Bill, appealed to the House to pass the bill unanimously to send a strong message to the world that terrorists are the enemies of humanity and India is committed to finish terror from its soil.

The Home Minister said that those who are opposing this bill now must remember that the original law was not brought by the current Government. “We have always supported a strong law against terrorism and have been committed to any amendment in this direction, in the past also. A tough law is required to uproot terrorism from India and we would always support that.”

In addition to this, Shri Shah said that terrorism has no religion and individuals of one religion must not be victimized. He further assured the House that Government is committed to protect the fundamental rights of all citizens. 

Shri Shah further added that terrorist acts are committed not by organizations but by individuals.
Declaring an organization as a terrorist organization will not stop the individuals behind it. Not designating individuals as terrorists, would give them an opportunity to circumvent the law and they would simply gather under a different name and keep up their terror activities. 

The Minister said that only those individuals who participate in terrorist activities, aid those indulging in such activities, propagate the ideology of terrorism and members of known terrorist organizations will be declared as terrorists after this amendment is passed. He added that terrorism is a global problem and the UN along with several other countries, have provisions in their laws to designate individuals as terrorists. 

The Amendment gives powers to DG, NIA to attach properties acquired from proceeds of terrorism. On this issue, Shri Shah said that this law does not take away powers of the state police. When NIA takes up a case having international and inter-state ramifications, all the facts pertinent to the case are with the NIA, and not with the state police. Currently, the law requires that NIA take prior permission from the respective state DGP to attach the proceeds of terrorism. This delays the process as often such properties are in different states, the Minister added.

Praising the NIA’s efficiency, the Minister said during the debate that the NIA’s conviction rate is 91%, which is exceptional by global standards.
Earlier, officers of ranks DSP and above were empowered to investigate cases under UAPA as per Section 43. The Amendment seeks to empower officers with the rank of inspectors and above to do the same. Commenting on the issue, Shri Shah said that this would help solve the human resource crunch in the NIA. The inspector rank officers have, over time, acquired sufficient proficiency to investigate UAPA related cases. Shri Shah added that this move would quicken the delivery of justice in UAPA related cases, which are reviewed by senior officers at various levels.

The campaign will include door to door activities, ward and city level events.

The e-course on Vulnerability Atlas is offered by the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs in collaboration of  School of Planning & Architecture (SPA), New Delhi and Building Materials & Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC). It is a unique course that offers awareness and understanding about natural hazards, helps identify regions with high vulnerability with respect to various hazards (earthquakes, cyclones, landslides, floods, etc.) and specifies district-wise level of damage risks to the existing housing stock. The e-course will be a tool for effective & efficient disaster mitigation & management in the field of Architecture, Civil Engineering, Urban & Regional Planning, Housing & Infrastructure Planning, Construction Engineering & Management and Building & Materials Research. The registration to e-Course on Vulnerability Atlas of India will be through SPA’s website www.spa.ac.in.

                The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) Mission has achieved a significant milestone of approving more than 85 Lakh houses against a demand of about 112 Lakh houses in urban areas. Out of these, around 51 Lakh houses are at various stages of construction and around 27 Lakh houses have already been completed. For the purpose of awarding the Champions of this achievement, PMAY(U) - 2019 Award, for Beneficiaries for “Best House Construction”, has been instituted for the first time to recognise the contribution of States/UTs, Urban Local Bodies and Beneficiaries.
The overwhelming participation on the mobile app PMAY(U), which was launched by Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs, in February 2019 for direct interface of beneficiaries with the mission, has marked its reach to 85 thousand beneficiaries so far across all States/ UTs and more than 2 lakh photos have been received. This has led to the decision of extending the last date to participate in PMAY(U) awards – 2019, upto 31st August ‘2019.
It has also led to the inclusion of a new award in the category of ‘Special Awards’ wherein the State contributing maximum percentage photographs through PMAY(U) mobile app will also be awarded. The special award for beneficiaries is likely to enthuse the States / UTs to fulfil the dream of house for millions, a reality, and also encourage beneficiaries to build their house aesthetically using sustainable methods.
The highlight of the PMAY(U) awards is that it will also recognise and reward the selected beneficiaries from each State/UT under ‘Beneficiary-led Construction’ component for building their houses in a most aesthetic and innovative manner. The mobile app PMAY(U) has been designed for beneficiaries to upload high-resolution photographs and videos clips highlighting their success stories of owning a house under PMAY (U). These stories are an emotional recount of experiences such as increased self-esteem, social upliftment, sense of pride and dignity, safety and security for the family, protected environment for girl child and children’s education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The procedure of selection for these awards has been made transparent by linking it with the progress being uploaded in MIS system by States/UTs. The winners will be awarded during a National level Event.

                Dr. Thawar Chand Gehlot, Union Minister, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJ&E) has stated that the Government is fully committed to eradicate manual scavenging through the ‘The Prevention of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013’. He was speaking at the national Workshop Cum Exhibition on Sustainable Sanitation organised by MoSJ&E and the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) here today. Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs, Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MohUA, Smt. Nilam Sawhney, Secretary, MoSJ&E and more than 500 representatives including the Principal Secretaries (UD), Mission Directors of AMRUT & Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) in States/Union Territories, Municipal Commissioners of 500 cities with population of 1 lakh and above and development partners besides senior official from both the ministries attended the workshop. 

The Minister for  Social Justice & Empowerment  added that the Government has  been laying increasing emphasis on mechanical cleaning and preventing human entry into sewer and septic tanks to the extent possible through the use of modern technologies. Further, Shri Gehlot said, Through the National Safai Karmacharis Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC) formal integration of these workers is being done through the disbursement of grants, provision of loans and livelihood training programs. I am happy to see that this workshop cum exhibition today will showcase the varied measures, best practices and technologies available that will go a long way in preventing fatalities due to hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. Swachh Bharat is indeed the first step towards Swasth Bharat.”

Addressing the gathering Shri Puri said, “Our Ministry has consistently made efforts to devise efficient systems, processes and technologies for mechanical cleaning of sewer and septic tanks. The Ministry has undertaken various initiatives to eliminate human entry into septic tanks and sewers and create an ecosystem for sustainable sanitation - the publication of documents such as the CPHEEO Manual on Sewerage and Sewage Treatment Systems (2013) and Standard Operating Procedures for Cleaning of Sewers and Septic Tanks (2018) or organizing of the Global Technology Challenge, being some of them. The workshop today will be another step in this direction. The launch of the guidance document on “Emergency Response Sanitation Unit (ERSU) will go a long way in preventing fatalities of sanitation workers and guarantee their safety and well-being”. He further added, “The Manual on Stormwater Drainage Systems, 2019 released today, shall add a feather to the recently launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan by the Government and help cities and towns in water conservation, protection from flooding and water security. The Ministry is fully committed to support the endeavors of States & Urban Local Bodies as they progress towards total sanitation or Sampoorna Swachhata”.

Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA  said, “While the Directory of Sewer & Septage Cleaning Equipment launched today will be a guiding book for Urban Local Bodies as well as practitioners, the exhibition by prominent manufacturers and vendors showcasing emerging technologies, equipment and best practices on sewer and septic tank management will help provide customized solutions to city specific requirements in this area”. 

Alongside, through a series of panel discussions through the day, the workshop saw discussions and presentation of best practices on topics such as Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) based biomethanation under Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoP&NG), MSW to Bio-CNG through biomethanation and cotreatment of organic fraction of MSW with sludge.

The day long interaction among stakeholders is expected to provide a comprehensive roadmap for ensuring sustainable sanitation in urban areas. States and ULBs will  take these insights into their respective areas to further strengthen their strategy for achieving safe, sustainable and holistic sanitation.

                            The Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) will be organizing a one day national workshop cum exhibition at Vigyan Bhawan on 19 August, 2019. Shri Thawar Chand Gehlot, Union Minister, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJ&E) will be the Chief Guest of the event. The workshop which will also be graced by Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs will see participation from over 800 representatives including the Principal Secretaries (UD) and Mission Directors of AMRUT and Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) in States/Union Territories and Municipal Commissioners of 500 cities with population of 1 lakh and above, heads of Parastatal bodies, officials from MoHUA as well as MoSJ&E and development partners. 

 

            It has been the constant endeavour of the Ministry to ensure that dangerous and illegal practices such as manual scavenging and hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks be completely eliminated. In this regard, there have been many advisories and SOPs issued by MoHUA on safe cleaning and maintenance of septic tanks, sewer networks and manholes targeted at eliminating human casualties. The workshop on sustainable sanitation is being organized in order to bring together relevant stakeholders to strategize on mitigating the risks associated with manual entry into sewers / septic tanks in a systematic manner, and help eliminate such incidents and fatalities. 

 

            The workshop is being organized as part of the year long celebration of Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary. The focus of the workshop will be on discussing social and legal issues as well as technological and managerial interventions with regard to human entry into sewers and septic tanks. Alongside, the workshop will showcase best practices on Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of sewerage system including mechanical cleaning of sewers, faecal sludge management with mechanical cleaning of septic tanks, co-treatment of septage, and showcase the latest equipment and machinery for cleaning of sewers and septic tanks in the exhibition. The roles and responsibilities of the Emergency Response Sanitation Unit (ERSU), a proposed unit to systematise human entry into sewer/septic tanks in a professional, well trained, motivated and appropriately equipped manner.  Wastewater and stormwater management including rainwater harvesting in line with the Government’s focus on water conservation through the Jal Shakti Abhiyan will also form an important agenda of discussion at the workshop. To complement these efforts, the Ministry will release the Manual on Stormwater Drainage Systems, 2019, Advisory on ERSU and the Directory of Sewer and Septic Cleaning Equipment prepared by technical experts from the Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation (CPHEEO). 

 

Through a series of panel discussions through the day, the workshop will also see discussions and presentation of best practices on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) based biomethanation under Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoP&NG) and co­treatment of organic fraction of MSW with sludge. 

 

The day long interaction among stakeholders is expected to culminate into a comprehensive roadmap for ensuring sustainable sanitation in urban areas.  State/ UT and ULB level representatives, in the coming days, will organize similar workshops in their respective areas to further disseminate information and insights on this crucial subject thereby lending a new dimension to the issue of safe and sustainable sanitation.

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Housing & Urban Affairs launched the Swachh Survekshan 2020 (SS 2020), the fifth edition of the annual cleanliness survey conducted by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) here today. Alongside, the Swachh Survekshan 2020 Toolkit, SBM Water PLUS Protocol and Toolkit, Swachh Nagar – an integrated waste management app and AI enabled mSBM App were also launched. The event was webcast live for states and cities to witness the launches from across the country. The event also saw the release of a special Swachh Survekhan theme song featuring Kangana Ranaut, singers Kailash Kher and Monali Thakur. Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA, Shri V.K. Jindal, Joint Secretary & Mission Director and representatives from serval urban local bodies were also present at the launch.  

 

Speaking at the launch event, Shri Puri said, “Earlier this year, we had launched Swachh Survekshan League 2020 (SS League 2020) with the objective of sustaining the on ground performance of cities along with continuous monitoring of service level performance on cleanliness.  Today’s event for launching the Swachh Survekshan 2020, with field survey to be conducted in January 2020, is particularly significant since it gives us the opportunity to reaffirm once again our promise for a Clean, Garbage Free and Sanitary “New India”, by not only sustaining the gains that we have made under the SBM, but also by providing a roadmap to institutionalize the concept of total Swachhata among all our cities.” The Swachh Survekshan 2020 Toolkit launched by the Hon’ble Minister contains the detailed survey methodology and component indicators with scores to help cities to prepare themselves for the survey. 

 

Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA during his presentation on SS 2020 mentioned, “Every year, the Swachh Survekshan is redesigned innovatively, to ensure that the process becomes more and more robust, with focus on sustaining the changed behaviours”. He also elaborated on the key focus areas of SS 2020:

 



 

 

 

 

 

  

 

            

 

 

 

 

Shri Mishra also highlighted the key differentiators of SS 2020 from SS 2019:

 



 

Moreover, in line with the focus on continuity and sustainability, a major focus of SS 2020 indicators, both for the quarterly and annual assessments - has been on complete faecal sludge management and waste water treatment, in line with the Government’s promise made in its election manifesto. Reiterating its commitment to the cause, the Ministry also launched the Water PLUS Protocol and the accompanying Toolkit. Moving beyond ODF, ODF+ and ODF++, the Water PLUS protocol aims to provide a guideline for cities and towns to ensure that no untreated wastewater is released into the environment thereby enabling sustainability of the sanitation value chain. This is in line with the Government’s focus on water conversation and reuse under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan and also aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals on clean water and sanitation. The toolkit provides the detailed SBM Water Plus protocol laid down by MoHUA, along with declaration formats to be obtained from various stakeholders, that wards / work circles (in case under jurisdiction of development authority) and cities are required to submit, as part of the SBM Water Plus declaration and certification process. 

 

SS 2020 will be conducted in January 2020.  A major thrust of Swachh Survekshan has always been on citizen engagement, be it through citizen feedback or indicators involving citizen participation. This year, the citizen-centric focus has been enhanced substantially through verification of the progress made by cities on Swachhata through direct responses from citizens.  Continuing with its focus on providing integrated waste management solutions to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and citizens, MoHUA also launched the Swachh Nagar Mobile App. This app, with features such as tracking of waste collection by ULBs through route and vehicle monitoring, notification to citizens, online collection of user fee for waste collection and an effective grievance redressal mechanism, will be the answer to several issues that hinder effective waste management such as lack of monitoring, collection of segregated waste, and tracking the movement of waste vehicles and waste pickers, amongst others. 

 

The event also saw the launch of AI enabled mSBM App, a mobile app developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) that helps detect the beneficiary face and toilet seat in the photo uploaded using Artificial Intelligence (AI) model at the backend. This app will not only facilitate the applicants of Individual Household Toilets (IHHL) under SBM-U know the status of their application in real-time after uploading the photograph but also help them upload the correct photo. The App will also help the respective ULB nodal officer to verify and approve the application thereby significantly reducing the processing time for applicants. The launch event ended with the release of the Swachh Survekshan theme song. While Padmashree awardee Kailash Kher and Monali Thakur have lent their voice to the song titled ‘Swachhata Adhikar Hai’, national award winning actor, Kangana Ranaut has featured in the video.

                        Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has instituted PMAY(U) Awards for Beneficiariesfor the first time to recognise the contribution of States/UTs, Urban Local Bodies and Beneficiaries. This special award for beneficiaries is likely to enthuse the States / UTs to fulfil the dream of house for millions, a reality, and also encourage beneficiaries to build their house aesthetically using sustainable methods. The winners will be awarded during a National level Event. The procedure of selection for these awards has been made transparent by linking it with the progress being uploaded in MIS system by States/UTs.  This award is in addition to CLSS Award for recognising the contribution of PMAY (U) Banks and Housing Finance Companies.

 

The Pradhan MantriAwasYojana(Urban)- PMAY(U)- Mission has achieved a significant milestone of approving more than85 Lakh houses against a demand of about 112 Lakh houses in urban areas. Out of these, around 50 Lakh houses are at various stages of construction and more than 26 Lakh houses have already been completed.

The highlight of the PMAY(U) awards is that it will also recognise and reward the selected beneficiaries from each State/UT under ‘Beneficiary-led Construction’ component for building their house in a most aesthetic and innovative manner. To facilitate this, a PMAY(U) mobile application was launched by ShriHardeep S Puri, Minister of State (I/C)for Housing and Urban Affairs,in February this year for direct interface of beneficiaries with the PMAY(U) mission.The mobile app has been designed for beneficiaries to upload high-resolution photographs and videos clips highlighting their success stories of owning a house under PMAY (U). These stories are an emotional recount of experiences such as increased self-esteem, social upliftment, sense of pride and dignity, safety and security for the family, protected environment for girl child and children’s education. The mobile app has marked its reach to more than 50 thousand beneficiaries so far across all States/ UTs. 

The last date to participate in the Awards is 20th August ‘2019.

The Union Minister for Information & Broadcasting and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar today unveiled the new logo and certificate design of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The launch was done at a special interaction between the film industry of India and board members of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), organized by CBFC in Mumbai today. Ekta Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Sanjay Khan, Satish Kaushik, Madhur Bhandarkar, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Boney Kapoor, Ramesh Sippy, Anupama Chopra, Subhash Ghai, Sudhir Mishra, Atul Kasbekar, Vidya Balan, Siddharth Roy Kapur, Prahlad Kakkar, Kiran Shantaram and Kunal Kohli were among the film fraternity present, apart from Secretary, I&B, Shri Amit Khare and Chairman, CBFC, Shri Prasoon Joshi.



Addressing the film industry and CBFC board members, the Chief Guest and I&B Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar said that the introduction of QR code in the new certificate design is in sync with the changed digital world. He said it will bring in greater transparency and provide richer information to filmmakers. He congratulated CBFC for the effectiveness with which it has been discharging its functions.



Shri Javadekar added: “When cable television and later DTH was introduced, people never imagined that prices of TV channels can be so low, but it will soon happen after the order of TRAI. These days, due to social media, with just one or two shows, it becomes clear whether a film will succeed or not.”

Noting the importance of entertainment in modern life, the Minister made an appeal to all TV producers to use technology so that visually impaired people can understand the films better: “Such technology can be used at a cost of 1 or 2 lakh rupees per film. Similarly, private news channels should also try to bring out at least one bulletin per week for deaf people”. 

Speaking about the upcoming golden jubilee edition of International Film Festival of India, the Minister said: “IFFI this year will be very special. The theme of IFFI 2019 is Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat. The opening and closing ceremonies will reflect this theme. I appeal to all to come and attend it. As our Prime Minister said, film is industry too; we are trying to have Film Business Summit, which will look into the business aspect of films. Film Bazaar is planned to be organized in Mumbai, which will look into business promotion, technology diffusion and export promotion”. 



Shri Javadekar informed that the Government is changing the Cinematograph Act, in order to curb piracy: “We earlier tried to protect the rights of artists by changing Copyright Act, now we are changing the Cinematograph Act so that piracy can be curbed”. He also invited suggestions and recommendations from audience and other stakeholders regarding certification of online content.



Commenting on the new design, the Chairman, CBFC said: “I believe design should reflect the contemporary digital world and leverage the ease that technology has brought in our work processes. The design change is not cosmetic; it is extremely functional and underlines CBFC’s positive value-added approach.” 



In his talk, the Chairman highlighted various initiatives taken by CBFC during the last few years, for the benefit of the industry. He said that the Board has been playing an active and positive role in taking forward the issues of the film industry. The Board has brought in greater transparency and smoother processes. Filmmakers can find any detail about any film on the website of CBFC today, he said. AWBI (Animal Welfare Board of India) issues have been simplified. He added that the dialogic and consultative approach has resulted in a more collaborative process. He said that if we are anchored in collective human good, there is no way we will not be able to find solutions through a dialogic approach. He was extremely appreciative of his Board members who have been instrumental in taking this forward. The board comprises Narendra Kohli, Vidya Balan, Waman Kendre, Vivek Agnihotri, Gautami Tadimalla, T. S. Nagabharana, Vani Tripathi Tikoo, Naresh Chander Lal, Neil Herbert Nongkynrih, Jeevitha Rajasekhar, Ramesh Patange and Mihir Bhuta.

Speaking about the evolution of art, the Chairman said that historically, art used to be participative and built on the idea of cocreation. However, condescension entered into the field later, with the performer being active and the audience passive. Shri Joshi said that technology has now introduced a new reality of active performer and active audience, giving voice to the people. He said that when art goes out, the intent of the artist is sometimes not understood, due to different vantage points of people; this necessitates some extra effort to make oneself understood. Talking about culture, Shri Joshi said that cultural symbols such as language are a part of the collective subconscious and that their choice can only be decided collectively. He also said that trust between audience and creative people is paramount; if trust in artists is lost, it will have a harmful effect on our world. There can only be dialogue, not diktat, when it comes to cultural expression, this is the approach that has been adopted at CBFC, the Chairman said. He said that it is important to listen to the murmurs of the society, to be sensitive to the disadvantaged. Shri Joshi highlighted the need to educate citizens about the meaning of various film ratings.   

The new design is futuristic in its approach and in sync with the new digital world. It is also interactive in its design sensibility: by scanning the QR code, more information on the certificate can be obtained online. Shri Prasoon Joshi himself has conceptualised the new look. The design has been done by designer Shri Rohit Devgun, with technical support from NSDL.



 

On the occasion, the Regional Officer, CBFC Mumbai, Shri Tushar Karmakar presented an overview of the recent activities, initiatives and achievements of the organization. Shri Karmakar highlighted E-Cinepramaan, the online film certification system of CBFC, an initiative launched by the then I&B Minister in March 2017, to promote transparency and ease of doing business. Frequently meeting the industry at different forums and creating opportunities for the film fraternity and the government representatives to meet and interact is also a step in this direction. The RO stated that the approach of the Board has led to improved mutual understanding & appreciation by the film fraternity.

Union Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Environment, Forests and Climate Change Shri Prakash Javadekar said that Perform, Reform and Transform are the three pillars on which New India's vision has been build upon. He was delivering the keynote address on the topic 'New India: Government and Media' at the News Conclave organised by Malayala Manorama company limited at Kochi, Kerala.

Shri Javadekar said that the New India envisioned by government will be corruption free, terror free, casteism free, communalism free and poverty free. ""We have a diverse country. Diversity is the spirit of India. Live and let live is the basis of Indian philosophy"", he said.

 

The minister reaffirmed his government's ever continuing commitment towards media freedom. ""Media freedom is the essence of democracy. But it must be also understood that in a democratic civil society, freedom has to be responsible freedom. Responsible freedom is not regulated freedom; its self regulation using our own methods,"" he said.

Union Minister said that incidents of mob lynching are even happening in the country due to rumours spreading in social media. This happens because of the absence of an authority or self regulatory mechanism in social media, he said.

Replying to questions, the minister said that the government welcomes all kind of criticism as they give insights into governance. ""We believe in free institutions because they are the strength of democracy"", the minister added. Touching upon the media freedom in Kashmir, Shri Javadekar said that though there was a phase of reasonable restrictions, most of them have been being progressively removed every day; and we will have a completely normal, new Kashmir and new India. Earlier, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the conclave via video conferencing from Delhi.

                It is observed that sections of the Media have taken a quote of Union Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar out of context. The quote in question was given by the Minister during the presentation of National Awards for Community Radio on 28.8.19, wherein he was highlighting the power of Communication and importance of Community Radio.

 

At the same event, the Minister also launched “Jan Connect”, a booklet highlighting the key decisions taken by the Government in the first 75 days of its second term. Speaking about the same, he talked about several key decisions, including the landmark decision of abrogation of Article 370.

 

In this context, Shri Javadekar said that “Sections of Media have unnecessarily attempted to link the situation in Jammu & Kashmir region with my comments about the significance of Community Radio and Communication in general, which amounts to irresponsible and unethical journalism.”

The event was part of the ongoing 7th Community Radio Sammelan. He also released the booklet “Jan Connect: Clear Intentions, Decisive Actions” on key decisions taken by the Government in the first 75 days of its second tenure.

Union Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar congratulated all the award winners and commended the stellar role being played by all the representatives of Community Radio Stations from all across the country. He said that the aim of the government is to increase the number of Community Radio Stations from 262 to 500 to give further fillip to the Community Radio Movement in the country. Stating that radio is the most powerful and reliable medium of communication, he highlighted the success of Mann ki Baat which has now become ‘Desh ki Baat’ and everyone’s ‘Dil ki Baat’. He urged the participants of the Sammelan to share their experiences and come up with suggestions for further bettering content and quality of programmes.  He also requested them to write to him with suggestions for improvement. A compendium of all the programmes running on Community Radio Stations all across the country was also released during the event. 



 

Shri Javadekar said that the booklet “Jan Connect: Clear Intentions, Decisive Actions” presents the landmark decisions taken in the first 75 days of the second term of the Government. He stated that the decision to abrogate Article 370 was taken to ensure that the quality of life of local people improves through applicability of several laws and legislations like Right to Education, reservation benefits, among others. He said that while Indian Economy has moved from 11th to 5th pedestal from 2014 to 2019, the aim of making India a $5 trillion economy will help India reach the third spot. He also talked about the speed of passing legislations, stating that Rajya Sabha, which was once considered a speed breaker, has become a highway for passing legislations. Shri Javadekar also highlighted increase in spending on infrastructure development, key decisions like that on Triple Talaq,  financial support for farmers, pension for workers in unorganized sector and businessmen etc, stating that all the decisions have been taken keeping the ultimate beneficiaries, the people in mind.

Representatives of all operational Community Radio Stations across the country along with senior officials of Ministry of Information & Broadcasting were present on the occasion. 



A poster exhibition of Community Radio Stations was also inaugurated by Shri Amit Khare.



Speaking at the inauguration, Shri Khare commended the Community Radio Stations for the zeal with which they have been spearheading the Community Radio Movement in the country. He highlighted the significance of Community Radio and the role played by these stations in disseminating information especially during the time of disasters. He added that the hard work put in by the people behind these Stations has resulted in visible changes, especially in the rural areas.






He said that local language, content and requirements can be suited and adapted by Community Radio, which can act as hubs of local information dissemination at the ground level. He said that each district of the country should have at least one Community Radio, with priority being setting them up in the Aspirational Districts. He exhorted the members present to act as brand ambassadors for spreading the word about adoption of Community Radio. 

With respect to the theme of the Sammelan, Shri Khare said that there exists a need to dovetail content of Community Radio with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). He urged the Community Radio representatives to also spread the messages of schemes and programmes of Government, especially those which directly impact people’s lives. He also requested the representatives to identify local heroes like teachers and sportspersons from amongst the community to help make the message delivery more impactful.

A short film on the step by step process for setting up of Community Radio Station was also launched by Shri Amit Khare on the occasion.





Shri Atul Kumar Tiwari, Addl. Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, said that Community Radio gives a platform for local voices and is necessary for community empowerment. Stating that the theme of SDGs is “leave no one behind”,  he said that the connect of individual with community and of community with nation can be strengthened through Community Radio.

Ms. TCA Kalyani, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting equated the presence of representatives of all operational radio stations with a mini India under one roof, with representatives present from all across the country. She highlighted the need for capacity building for ensuring sustainability of Community Radio Stations.

The plenary sessions on “The SDG Journey - leaving no one behind” was chaired by Shri Rakesh Ranjan, Senior Consultant, Niti Aayog, while that on “Community Radio: Issues, Ideas and Experiences” was chaired by Ms. Esther Kar, Former Director General, Press Information Bureau.

                Doordarshan has been carrying sign language interpretation of the address of President of India on the eve of Independence Day and Prime Minister’s address from the ramparts of Red Fort on Independence Day every year. This year too, President’s address and the entire function from Red Fort will be telecast live with sign language interpretation on DD Bharati channel.

In a major step towards implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting has decided to implement Accessibility Standards for Persons with Disabilities in television programmes for private TV channels also from this Independence Day. 

In a significant beginning from this year’s Independence Day, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting has asked Private Satellite News TV channels also to telecast a short programme on Independence Day Celebrations, along with corresponding sign language interpretation, in the afternoon/evening of 15th August. The channels have been told that they may either make their own programme with sign language interpretation, or, if they wish, they may carry a bulletin prepared by DD News free of cost. This information was given by Shri Amit Khare, Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting while speaking at a function organized by NCPEDP at IIC, New Delhi. Ministry of I&B was given Special Jury Award at this function for its path breaking work in making television accessible for people with hearing disabilities.

                Vice President Shri Venkaiah Naidu has said that abrogation of Article 370 is in the interest of the Nation. Speaking at a function, to release a book titled “Listening, Learning and Leading” chronicling his two years in office as Vice President, Shri. Naidu said abrogation of Article 370 should not be considered as a political issue but a bold move taken in the interest of security of the nation and the future of people of Jammu and Kashmir.



Stating that people must always learn from history and move forward, the Vice President said it is at this juncture that we should stand by the people of Kashmir and restore normalcy.

     The Book “Listening, Learning and Leading” was released by Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah. Vice President Shri Venkaiah Naidu received the first copy.   The event was hosted by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. 



Recalling the Government’s move in bringing the bill for abrogation of the article in the Rajya Sabha, Vice President  said  after views of the cross section of the polity in the Upper house was heard, the bill after proper vetting was passed by the house with a two third’s majority.

   Reminiscing his days as a student leader from a humble farmer’s family, he said commitment, dedication, sincerity to a cause in which he believed had helped him achieve great heights both in the BJP and in the Government.  He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his mantra on Reform Perform and Transform which brought about a massive change in the mindset of the people on development and had put India in  a pedestal receiving global attention.

   Urging Parliamentarians to refrain from dysfunctional behavior and stop acrimony and emotional outbursts which disrupted the effective functioning of the esteemed Upper House, Vice President called on legislators to realize the dreams of the Constitution makers.



     Appealing to the Government to bridge the gap between policy intent and implementation, he said there is serious introspection that is needed to improve the quality of service delivery, to benefit the people at large. Result based management system should become the norm, he said.

      Listing a series of measures needed to reform the Judicial system, the Vice President said that justice dispensing structures must be accessible, credible, equitable and transparently even- handed . He urged the government to take steps to set up a Bench of the Supreme Court in Chennai, besides in the East and the West.

    Referring to the shortfalls in the anti-defection law, he said the law was not implemented in letter and spirit .  He said because of the  inaction of the Speaker or Chairman, the defecting legislators continue in the new party, which is a kind of travesty of justice, which should not be tolerated.

     Union Minister for Home Affairs Shri.Amit Shah  in his address said he strongly believes that Article 370 would bring terrorism to an end and will take Kashmir forward in the path of development. Stating that Article 370 should have been abrogated a long time ago, Shri. Amit Shah said he had no confusion in his mind that it scrapping of Article 370 was in the interest of the people of Kashmir.



He said Vice President and Chairman of Upper House, acumen led to abrogation of Article 370  after taking into consideration the views of all parties.  The Home Minister recalled Shri.  Venkaiah Naidu’s days as a student leader, who had led an agitation against Article 370, and it was sheer coincidence that he presided over the Rajya Sabha when the Article 370 was abrogated.

     Paying accolades to the self less service of Vice President to the Nation, he said Mr Venkaiah Naidu worked his heart out to turn his vision for urban and rural development into reality.

     Union Minister for Information & Broadcasting and  Environment, Forests & Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar said Vice President personal rapport with Parliamentarians was above party affiliations,   ensuring functioning of the Upper House smoothly, resulting in passage of record number of bills in the last session.  Vice President Venkaiah Naidu’s popular alliteration and witty remarks, created a cordial atmosphere in the Rajya Sabha, where the opposition has its say, even as the Government had its way, in clearing legislative businesses.  



      Tamil Nadu Governor Shri. Banwarilal Purohit, Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy, Deputy Chief Minister O.Paneerselvam and host of dignitaries from various walks of life participated in the function.



   Ministry of  Information and Broadcasting Secretary Shri Amit Khare proposed the vote of thanks.



As part of the book release, Regional Outreach Bureau, Chennai organized a photo exhibition highlighting the journey of the Vice President from a student leader. Shri.  Venkaiah Naidu’s interaction with cross section of society, meeting with world leaders and visits to Universities, Research institutions were also pictured.

The author fluidly writes on some of the cult films, including some which have acquired their legendary status because of reasons other than cinematic. This book is a fine example of how cinema criticism can transcend quality or the lack of it in cinema itself.

                Union Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar today, on the anniversary of Quit India Movement, presented the book “Mahatma Gandhi: Chitramaya Jeevan Gatha” to the President of India Shri Ram Nath Kovind in Rashtrapati Bhavan today. The book narrates the pictorial story of the life and times of Mahatma Gandhi through 550 photographs. It has been brought out by the Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting.

Brief about the Books

With rare photographs detailing the life and times of Mahatma Gandhi, the books not only portray the birth of a shy boy, his early years and education, making of a Mahatma (in South Africa), his experiments with truth through his various movements–first in South Africa and then in India, but also the story of the intensive Indian Freedom Struggle of 20th century, of which he was the main architect.

For the first time, the Hindi version of the book has been brought out in order to cater to further the outreach and cater to a wider reader base.



This English version of the book was first brought out in 1954, taking photographs from the Sarvodaya Diwas Pradarshni organised at Rajghat in January 1949 to mark the first anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s death. This heritage publication, along with the new Hindi version, with photo support from National Gandhi Museum, has now been reprinted with better design and production quality.

Shri Prakash Javadekar apprises President about efforts of I&B Ministry towards celebrating #Gandhi150

Union Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar presented an overview of the books to the President, terming these albums as a kaleidoscope of India’s freedom struggle.  He also highlighted the efforts of the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting and Publications Division towards celebrating the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The task of the Ministry is not merely limited to its own efforts but also includes highlighting the efforts of all other Ministries of the Government through its Media Units in order to reach out to people effectively. 

The Minister also apprised the President about the publication of Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, which is available in e-version as well. To mark the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Publications Division has brought out more than twenty books and  fifty e-books, including a book on Kasturba Gandhi. The President Shri Ram Nath Kovind appreciated the efforts of I&B Ministry in spreading the values and ideals which Gandhiji stood for.  He asked the officials to further augment the efforts in the week preceding Gandhi Jayanti this year. He also exhorted all government employees to participate actively in the celebrations marking the 150th Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Team DPD meets President of India

Secretary, I&B, Shri Amit Khare introduced the Publications Division team behind these books - Principal Director General Dr. Sadhana Rout, Director Shri Rajendra Bhatt, Jt. Director Shri VK Meena and Designer Shri Neeraj Sahai -  to the President.

The Second All India Annual Conference of Indian Information Service Officers was organized at Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra in New Delhi today. The Conference was organized with a view to attain greater integration of all Media Units under the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting in order to further amplify government communication.

 



 

The Conference included sessions on Adoption of Integrated and Theme Based Communication Approach; Regional Expansion of Social Media and use of Integrated Dashboard; Adoption of Government Communication Impact Assessment Framework; Roadmap for celebration of 550th Anniversary of Guru Nanak, 150th Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, 75 Years of India's Independence and Golden Jubilee Edition of International Film Festival of India. A Performance Review of Media Units under the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting was also conducted during the Conference.

 

Union Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar conveyed his message to the Delegates of the Conference wherein he highlighted the importance of feedback along with communicating the programmes and policies of government, stating that the IIS Officers are the eyes and ears of the government. He urged them to avoid working in silos and instead adopt a unified approach to communication through working in tandem with officers of sister Media Units of the Ministry. He suggested forging relations with institutions of Mass Communication and utilizing the talent pool available through internship programmes to harness the imagination of youngsters in making government communication more interesting and in tune with the changing demands. 

 



 

Speaking in the inaugural session, I&B Secretary Shri Amit Khare said that there is a necessity to shift government communication from segregated Ministry-wise approach to a holistic, thematic approach, which is citizen-centric in nature. He stressed on the importance of adoption of participatory communication approach to ensure pro-active involvement of citizens, especially those who are beneficiaries of government schemes. He also said that the IIS Officers need to push for greater adoption of digital outlook in communication, giving the example of exploring the possibility of issuing media releases with short embedded videos instead of press releases.

 



The Conference was attended by Senior IIS Officers from all across the country, along with officials of the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Prasar Bharati and Indian Institute of Mass Communication.

                Union Minister for Jal Shakti,ShriGajendra Singh Shekhawat,chaired aConference of State Ministers on Jal Jeevan Mission in New Delhi today.  State Ministers in-charge of Drinking Water from 17 States; and Principal Secretaries/Secretaries attended theconference. The objective of the Conference was to discuss the implementation of the newly announced Jal Jeevan Mission,to provide individual household water tap connection to everyrural household in the country by 2024. 

The Jal Shakti Minister referred to the announcement made by the Prime Minister during his Independence Day speech on 15th August 2019, wherein he announced the Government’s renewed efforts to provide water supply to every household by 2024.He shared that the Mission would fulfill the aspiration of the people in extending services as it had with housing, toilets, electricity, cooking gas, financial inclusion, social security/ pension, health care and roads etc.

Depleting ground water level, over exploitation and deteriorating water quality, climate change, etc. are major challengesto provide potable drinking water. The Jal Jeevan Mission is set to be based on various water conservation efforts like point recharge, de-silting of minor irrigation tanks, use of grey water for agriculture and source sustainability. Citing successful models from across the country, he encouraged all states to plan for recharge and reuse of grey water generated from households for agriculture and irrigation purpose.He emphasized the need for convergence of various funds available under MGNREGS, MPLAD, MLALAD, Finance Commission Grants, etc. to implement the source sustainability measures. He appealed to all states to generate maximum community participation in the form of ‘jan andolan’ to achieve the target of functional household tap connection by 2024.

The Minister of State, Ministry of Jal Shakti,Shri Rattan Lal Katariahighlighted that drinking water is a basic requirement and water supply has been placed at the center of the development agenda for the Government.

                Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar said that Private Security Industry is among one of the five top most employment generating sectors in the country while addressing Private Security Industry Conclave organized by FICCI. Approximately 50 lakh security personnels are safeguarding our Factories, Banks, Offices and Apartments and doing great service to the nation.

 

He further said that with the passage of Code on Wages by Parliament on August 02, 2019, Central Government has given the right of minimum wages to approximately 50 crore unorganized sector workers and the same will be applicable to security guards also. Wages of security guards vary from Rs. 5,000 to 13,000 in various states. To do away with these discrepancies, we have made provision of National Minimum floor wage and no State Government can fix the wages below this floor wage. 

 

Shri Gangwar said that Occupational Safety, Health and Working Condition Code have been introduced in Lok Sabha on July 23, 2019 to improve working conditions and safety of the employees. We have also launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan Dhan (PMSYM) Scheme to bring all the workers under the cover of Social Security. With a monthly contribution of Rs. 55 to Rs. 200, workers can get a monthly pension of Rs. 3,000 after attaining the age of 60 years. The Minister appealed all the employers of the security agencies to motivate security guards to take benefit from PMSYM. He assured that Central Government is working on the principle of ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’ and we are using technology to make life easy for everyone. Steps to promote single license, single registration and single return in place of multiple license, registration and returns will definitely promote ‘Ease of Living’ and ‘Ease of doing Business’.

                Rajya Sabha passed The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 today after due consideration and discussion. Lok Sabha has already passed the bill on July 30, 2019. The Bill will become an Act after Presidential assent.

It will be the first Code to become an Act out of the four Codes: Code on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions which Ministry of Labour and Employment has formulated. Ministry aims to simplify, rationalise and amalgamate various labour laws into four Labour Codes in line with the recommendations of second National Commission on Labour. One more Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions has also been introduced in Lok Sabha.

 

Speaking during the discussion in the Rajya Sabha the Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar said that Code on Wages is a historic bill which will ensure statutory protection for minimum wages and timely payment of wages to approximately 50 crore workers of organized as well as unorganized sector. The Minister responded to the debate in detail and thanked all the respected members for cooperation in passing the Bill. He further said, to do away with regional imbalances and wage variations, a floor wage will be determined by a Tripartite Committee. The Committee will comprise of representatives of Trade Unions, Employers Organizations and State Governments. Committee can also form Technical Committee if required. Shri Gangwar said that Code on Wages will prove to be a milestone as it will promote respectful life to every worker of the country.

                The Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Road Transport and Highways, Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that the Government has taken up a mission-mode project of creating 5 crore jobs in 5 years in the MSME sector. He said that the Government has decided to take the proportion of MSME exports to 50% and to increase the GDP contribution of the MSME sector from 29% to 50% in the next 5 years. The Minister said this while addressing a business summit “Globalizing the Brand Khadi: The Pride of India”, organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), in Mumbai today.



Addressing the gathering of industry and other stakeholders, the Union MSME Minister, Shri Nitin Gadkari also said: “A distinction is often made between India and Bharat. There are many problems in villages due to which people migrate from villages to cities in search of jobs. We need to stop this phenomenon; we want that people do not have to come to cities due to lack of jobs. This would happen when we are able to provide good roads, schools, hospitals, farm revenue and economic viability for occupations in rural areas. This is why Gandhiji used to say that we need maximum production with the involvement of maximum number of people. Along with modernization and mechanization, we need to look at employment opportunities as well. Innovation, entrepreneurship, science, technology, research and skill generate knowledge, which needs to be converted into wealth.” 

The Minister said we need to strengthen the Khadi sector, the turnover of Khadi and village sector needs to be further increased; a large segment of the population is dependent on this.

Shri Gadkari informed that his Ministry is in talks with the Ministry of Railways to serve tea in kulhads made of terracotta. “Currently, this is available in two stations; I have written to the Railway Minister and to the Transport Ministers of all states to make these kulhads mandatory in all bus stations and railway stations,” He said. 

Shri Gadkari further said that Khadi is the soul of Gandhiji’s thinking. Without compromising with its principles, we need to modernize Khadi – in product design, fashion design, weaving and other processes. New research needs to be incorporated and adopted. In particular, we need to look at how we can make better quality and low-cost yarn than what is made in the mills. There is a need for professional approach in fashion design, so as to improve quality of Khadi products. 

The Minister called upon enterprising people in the private sector to come forward to promote Khadi. “This is not difficult from the point of view of technology and quality,” he said; “if we receive good inputs from industry, the brand Khadi can be made world-famous. Consumer choices have changed; this summit aims to garner industry cooperation in increasing the brand value and market value of Khadi.” 

Shri Gadkari further said that as the facilitator, the Government is working on policies to promote growth. The government will provide support in measures such as reducing cost of capital, in bringing in mechanization and modernization, and in reducing logistics and power costs.

He said the Government is developing an e-market portal like Alibaba, by the name of Bharat Craft. This will provide a direct interface between buyers and sellers. We are also launching a Bank of Ideas and Innovations.

“The government is transparent, corruption-free, and trying to fast-track decision making. We seek your cooperation and suggestions in taking Khadi forward and in providing employment to maximum number of people. There is huge potential which can be unleashed using research and technology. As per Gandhiji’s dream, we need maximum production with involvement of maximum number of rural people. We need to ensure the presence of Khadi in every nation and take it to every corner of the world. We hope to achieve this with your cooperation”.

On the occasion, the Minister also launched Tech Saksham, a CII Tech Project, aimed at accelerating MSME growth through technology enablement. 



The Minister of State for MSME Shri Pratap Chandra Sarangi said: “Khadi industry gained prominence during our independence struggle under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhiji transformed a simple product into a symbol of national pride. A simple fabric became a great weapon for our national movement.



Now, our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi wants to advance this idea and globalize Khadi. Khadi has universal appeal. It is eco-friendly, hygienic for the body, uses less water and provides livelihood support to millions. I am confident that if 130 crore citizens use Khadi, it will provide employment opportunities to more than 15 crore people. So, we can serve the nation in a better way by purchasing Khadi. 

The industry needs expansion, its scope is enormous. We need to think of ways to provide artisans their due, to improve market availability and access and to provide technology to artisans.

Khadi is the most suitable sector not only to provide employment but also to spread our culture. It acts as our national ambassador when Khadi is taken abroad. Khadi has the unique soothing quality of being warm in winters, cool in summers. The charm is that all fabrics are handmade. 

The middle-men should be removed as much as possible, so that maximum profit goes to the artisans, enabling them to lead a dignified life. The beauty of Khadi needs to be spread all over the world. We can fight the evil of poverty through Khadi.”

Secretary, MSME, Dr. Arun Kumar Panda said: “Khadi is a cause which is important for the nation as well as for the people in the field. Khadi has great heritage and strengths. At the same time, Khadi faces a lot of challenges. I hope this platform with presence of experts from various verticals will help in coming up with a roadmap for Khadi. Please come up with ideas and solutions to strengthen the sector. 



No two pieces of Khadi are identical. Khadi is hand-crafted, premium, niche. 

We need to think differently and explore how technology can be used for the benefit of Khadi. After Aadhaar-seeding, the number of artisans involved in the Khadi sector has come down to a realistic figure of around 4.75 lakh. Every incentive provided to artisans now goes directly to their bank account through Direct Benefit Transfer. We need to expand this, to bring in better standards, quality and international collaborations. 

Can we use technology to ensure low-cost in-time credit availability for artisans? Technology should be used to improve market access, both inside and outside the country. 

The government has decided to set up four design houses across the country, exclusively for Khadi. One challenge we need to address is how we attract young and aspirational people towards Khadi? 

How can we reduce the weight and cost of the Charkha, so that drudgery of artisans can be reduced using technology? My request to the industry is to nurture Khadi as your own baby. The government is planning to produce two films – one for domestic and the other for the international audience. The Ministry would welcome volunteers too to get these films done. We need to look at niche markets where value addition happens and that money goes to artisans. 

The media too has a huge role to play in positioning Khadi as a niche product in India and abroad.”

Chairman, KVIC, Shri Vinay Kumar Saxena said: “From around 889 crore rupees in 2014, the turnover of KVIC has gone up to 3215 crore rupees now, thanks in large part to the appeal by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to adopt Khadi; through this summit, our objective is to find ways to take this turnover to take to the tune of 20,000 crore rupees. 



Khadi has certain inherent qualities which are not yet realized. We need to tell this to the public. Khadi is the most natural fabric. It is zero carbon footprint fabric, which no machine can make. It is most environment-friendly; one metre of Khadi cloth requires 3 litres of water, while the same cloth when produced in a mill consumes 56 litres of water.

The turnover of Khadi and village industry has increased from 32,000 crore rupees in 2014-15 to 74,000 crore rupees now. 

The acceptability of Khadi too has increased, which results in jobs for artisans. Khadi is the best example of Make in India. 

I appeal to everyone to understand the feel of Khadi and its products, and give it a platform. KVIC has entered into joint ventures with corporates, which has had an impact on the corporates. 

Khadi is a purely hand-woven product, given to us by Mahatma Gandhi. We need to take it to the heights it deserves.”

The Summit concluded with a Vote of Thanks by Chairman – Western Region, CII, Shri P. Nandkumar.

                Khadi and Village Industry Commission (KVIC) distributed as many as 50 leather kits and 350 Bee-Boxes with live bee colonies in tribal-dominated village in Sirohi district of Rajasthan, one of the aspirational districts in India identified by the NITI Aayog, on World Tribal Day today. 



While addressing the villagers, KVIC Chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena said that programmes like Leather Mission, Kumhar Sashaktikaran Mission and Honey Mission are the reflection of KVIC`s commitment to uplift the lives of marginalised communities in  society. 



He said that KVIC is launching a new programme ‘Leather Mission’ on World Tribal Day from the tribal-dominated village of Chandala. Under this new programme, KVIC will give Leather Kits to the leather artisans across the nation. It will not only increase their incomes manifold but will also inspire the traditional leather artisans who had migrated to other jobs from their traditional skill to adopt this vocation again,.”

350 Bee-Boxes were distributed at the function. Honey Mission has proved as a game-changer in the lives of tribals, farmers, SC/STs and unemployed youths. So far, KVIC has distributed over 1.15 lakh Bee-Boxes across the nation among the marginalised community, which has provided jobs to over 11,500 people. It has not only increased the income of the bee-keeping farmers, but has also increased the yield of the crops by up to 30 percent due to cross-pollination of the honey-bees.

                A joint venture company namely Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. (KABIL) is to be set up with the participation of three Central Public Sector Enterprises namely, National Aluminium Company Ltd.(NALCO), Hindustan Copper Ltd.(HCL) and Mineral Exploration Company Ltd. (MECL). The Minister of Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs Shri Pralhad Joshi said that the objective of constituting KABIL is to ensure a consistent supply of critical and strategic minerals to Indian domestic market. While KABIL would ensure mineral security of the Nation, it would also help in realizing the overall objective of import substitution, he said.

The sustained source of mineral and metal commodities is imperative for the transportation and manufacturing segment. Recalling the commitment at the UN Climate Change Conference, Pairs, 2015, where India has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and opting a greener mode of transportation, the Minister said that the Prime Minister has been emphasizing upon Electric Vehicle Mobility. Shri Joshi, said therefore it is important to ensure energy storage through batteries. Further segments like Aviation, Defence and Space Research also require minerals with lower weight and high mechanical strength. Among such twelve minerals identified as strategic minerals, which have meagre resource base, Lithium Cobalt are significant.

The KABIL would carry out identification, acquisition, exploration, development, mining and processing of strategic minerals overseas for commercial use and meeting country’s requirement of these minerals. The sourcing of these minerals or metals is to done by creating trading opportunities, G2G collaborations with the producing countries or strategic acquisitions or investments in the exploration and mining assets of these minerals in the source countries. The new company will help in building partnerships with other mineral rich countries like Australia and those in Africa and South America, where Indian expertise in exploration and mineral processing will be mutually beneficial bringing about new economic opportunities. The equity participation between NALCO, HCL and MECL is in the ratio of 40:30:30

 

The joint venture agreement was signed in the presence of Shri Pralhad Joshi, Hon’ble Minister of Mines, Coal and Parliamentary Affairs. Shri Anil Mukim Secretary (Mines) and other senior officers were also present.

                In a decision that would give boost to the ocean energy in India, Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri RK Singh approved a proposal to declare ocean energy as Renewable Energy today.

Accordingly, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has clarified to all the stakeholders that energy produced using various forms of ocean energy such as tidal, wave, ocean thermal energy conversion etc. shall be considered as Renewable Energy and shall be eligible for meeting the non-solar Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO).

 

Background: Ocean Energy

 

1.    Introduction to Ocean Energy  

                 Oceans cover 70 percent of the earth’s surface and represent an enormous amount of energy in the form of wave, tidal, marine current and thermal gradient. A variety of different technologies are currently under development throughout the world to harness this energy in all its forms. Deployment is currently limited but the sector has the potential to grow, fuelling economic growth, reduction of carbon footprint and creating jobs not only along the coasts but also inland along its supply chains. 

            As Government of India steps up its effort to reach the objectives to contemplate its Renewable Energy and climate change objectives post 2022, it is opportune to explore all possible avenues to stimulate innovation, create economic growth and new jobs as well as to reduce our carbon footprint. India has a long coastline with the estuaries and gulfs. MNRE looks over the horizon at development of new technology and considers the various options available to support its deployment. Most types of technologies are currently at pre-R&D / demonstration stage or the initial stage of commercialization. Basic R&D is being looked after by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (example: National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai). MNRE intends to support demonstration projects of proven technologies and as approved by expert committee constituted by MNRE.

 

2.    Potential 


	Total identified potential of Tidal Energy is about 12455 MW, with potential locations identified at Khambat & Kutch regions, and large backwaters, where barrage technology could be used.
	The total theoretical potential of wave energy in India along the country’s coast is estimated to be about 40,000 MW – these are preliminary estimates. This energy is however less intensive than what is available in more northern and southern latitudes.
	OTEC has a theoretical potential of 180,000 MW in India subject to suitable technological evolution.


 

3.    Technology Although currently under-utilised, Ocean energy is mostly exploited by just a few technologies: Wave, Tidal, Current Energy and Ocean Thermal Energy. 

a)    Tidal Energy  

           The tidal cycle occurs every 12 hours due to the gravitational force of the moon. The difference in water height from low tide and high tide is potential energy. Similar to traditional hydropower generated from dams, tidal water can be captured in a barrage across an estuary during high tide and forced through a hydro-turbine during low tide. The capital cost for tidal energy power plants is very high due to high civil construction and high power purchase tariff.  To capture sufficient power from the tidal energy potential, the height of high tide must be at least five meters (16 feet) greater than low tide. The Gulf of Cambay and the Gulf of Kutch in Gujarat on the west coast have the locations in the country where potential exists.

 

b)    Wave Energy  

            Wave energy is generated by the movement of a device either floating on the surface of the ocean or moored to the ocean floor. Many different techniques for converting wave energy to electric power have been studied. Wave conversion devices that float on the surface have joints hinged together that bend with the waves. This kinetic energy pumps fluid through turbines and creates electric power. Stationary wave energy conversion devices use pressure fluctuations produced in long tubes from the waves swelling up and down. This bobbing motion drives a turbine when critical pressure is reached. Other stationary platforms capture water from waves on their platforms. This water is allowed to runoff through narrow pipes that flow through a typical hydraulic turbine.

 

c)     Current Energy  

            Marine current is ocean water moving in one direction. This ocean current is known as the Gulf Stream. Tides also create currents that flow in two directions. Kinetic energy can be captured from the Gulf Stream and other tidal currents with submerged turbines that are very similar in appearance to miniature wind turbines. Similar to wind turbines, the movement of the marine current moves the rotor blades to generate electric power. 

  

d)      Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)  

            Ocean thermal energy conversion, or OTEC, uses ocean temperature differences from the surface to depths lower than 1,000 meters, to extract energy. A temperature difference of only 20°C can yield usable energy. Research focuses on two types of OTEC technologies to extract thermal energy and convert it to electric power: closed cycle and open cycle. In the closed cycle method, a working fluid, such as ammonia, is pumped through a heat exchanger and vaporized. This vaporized steam runs a turbine. The cold water found at the depths of the ocean condenses the vapor back to a fluid where it returns to the heat exchanger. In the open cycle system, the warm surface water is pressurized in a vacuum chamber and converted to steam to run the turbine. The steam is then condensed using cold ocean water from lower depths.

  

4.         Technology Objectives 

          The objective of the technology programme is to accelerate and enhance support for the resource assessment and deployment of ocean energy in the country and to harness it for power generation and to overcome the barriers. The technology programme is open to public and private sectors to carry out projects in India. Industry lead R&D proposals are invited from stakeholders, for solving problems in Indian conditions. Basic R&D is being looked after by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (example: National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai).

            All the stakeholders desirous of utilizing Ocean Energy are invited by MNRE for demonstration projects of proven technologies under Research, Design, Development and Demonstration (RDD&D) programme/policy of the Ministry, in force at the time.

                Shri RK Singh, Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, launched the State Rooftop Solar Attractiveness Index–SARAL here, today.  The State of Karnataka has been placed at the first rank in the Index that evaluates Indian states based on their attractiveness for rooftop development. Telangana, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have got 2nd, 3rd and 4th rank respectively.

 

Launching the Index, Shri RK Singh said that it would incentivise rooftop solar by creating healthy competition among the States. He encouraged all States to adopt the best practices being followed by top ranking States. 

 



 

SARAL has been designed collaboratively by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation (SSEF), Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) and Ernst & Young (EY). It was launched during the Review Planning and Monitoring (RPM) Meeting with States and State Power Utilities. SARAL currently captures five key aspects – 

 


	robustness of policy framework 
	implementation environment 
	investment climate 
	consumer experience 
	business ecosystem


 

It encourages each state to assess the initiatives taken so far, and what it can do to improve its solar rooftop ecosystem. This will help states to channelize investments that can eventually help the sector grow.  In addition, such an exercise is likely to create a more conducive environment for solar rooftop installations, encourage investment and lead to accelerated growth of the sector.

 

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has set a target of 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, of which 100 GW solar power is to be operational by March 2022, of which 40 GW is expected to come from grid connected solar rooftops. The Indian Grid Connected Rooftop PV (GRPV) segment is slowly gaining momentum with substantial interest from entrepreneurs, developers, financial institutions, development banks, end users and government entities. On a very positive note, rooftop solar PV has already achieved grid parity for commercial and industrial consumers and is fast becoming attractive for residential consumers as well.

 

To achieve our rooftop solar targets, it is important to develop an ecosystem that ensures information symmetry, access to financing and clear market signals. Thus, the MNRE has developed the State Rooftop Solar Attractiveness Index–SARAL that evaluates Indian states based on their attractiveness for rooftop development. SARAL is the first of its kind index to provide a comprehensive overview of state-level measures adopted to facilitate rooftop solar deployment.

Review, Planning & Monitoring Meeting held

Power Minister Shri RK Singh chaired the Review Planning and Monitoring (RPM) Meeting with States and State Power Utilities. In his address to the State representatives, he emphasised the need to make Power Sector sustainable and viable so as to ensure 24/7 power supply to all consumers. The Meeting discussed various schemes and issues pertaining to the sector such as Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Distribution Scheme (IPDS), UDAY, 24/7 power supply etc.

The Meeting was attended by the Secretary, Power, Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, MNRE, Shri Anand Kumar, Special Secretary, Power, Shri Sanjiv Nandan Sahai, Senior officers of the Ministry of Power & MNRE, Principal Secretaries/Secretaries (Energy) of States, CMDs & MDs of Discoms and Power Sector PSUs.

                Ministry of New & Renewable Energy organised Curtain Raiser ceremony for the 3rd Edition of Renewable Energy Investors' Meet and Expo (RE-INVEST 2019) which will be held from 30th October to 2nd November 2019 in India, coinciding with the Second Assembly of International Solar Alliance (ISA). Objective of the event is to attract the right investments in renewable energy (RE) and present India’s RE story to the world.

Delivering the keynote address at the Curtain Raiser, Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship Shri RK Singh said that India holds enormous potential in renewable energy and it is an exciting place to invest in RE. “We have witnessed the emergence of an international consensus for renewable energy & RE-INVEST provides the perfect platform to take it forward,” the Minister added.

In his opening remark, Secretary, MNRE, Shri Anand Kumar said that in 2015, India had set a target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. We've already installed 80 GW and are set to exceed the target, he added.

 

In his address, DG, ISA, Shri Upendra Tripathy emphasized the need to align fiscal, financial & industrial policies to cumulatively charge up the global energy ecosystem and bring energy access to more than one billion people who are without power in the world. 

 

India is among the countries with the largest production of energy from renewable sources. As of June 30, 2019, India has an installed renewable energy capacity of 80.47 GW, of which solar and wind comprises 29.55 GW and 36.37 GW respectively. Biomass and small hydro power constitute 9.81GW and 4.6GW respectively. Thus, India offers one of the largest investment opportunities in the renewable space. The Government of India allows a 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route for projects of renewable power generation and distribution.

 

The 2nd Global RE-INVEST, was held from 2-5 October, 2018 and aimed at accelerating the worldwide effort to scale up renewable energy and connect the global investment community with Indian energy stakeholders. The 45 in-depth sessions featuring 220 speakers over the 3 days of the conference saw animated exchanges on various topics which brainstormed on expanding India’s RE market in the face of aggressive global competition.

	This Session has been historic in many ways as legislations relating to almost all walks of socio and economic activities have been passed.  30 Bills have been passed by both the Houses of Parliament in this Session which is a record in single first/effective Session after constitution of new Lok Sabha.


 


	The most important business transacted during this Session is theabrogation of certain provisions from Article 370 and Presidential Orders thereunder.  This will ensure equal opportunities to all sections of Society in Jammu & Kashmir particularly with the restoration of applicability of the provisions of the Constitution of India and all socio-economic legislations thereby ensuring rule of law and equity.  Further for ensuring better administration and for curbing terrorism, the State of Jammu & Kashmir has been reorganized with the formation of two Union Territories - Jammu &Kashmir and Ladakh.  


 


	Health Sector Reforms - During this Session four Bills namely the National Medical Commission Bill, 2019, the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2019, the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2019 and the Dentist (Amendment) Bill, 2019 have been passed by both the Houses. Particularly the National Medical Commission Bill, 2019 is a revolutionary reform in medical field which provides for constitution of a National Medical Commission for development and regulation of all aspects relating to medical education, medical profession and medical institutions and a Medical Advisory Council to advise and make recommendations to the Commission.


 


	Social and Gender Justice - Certain Billsto further strengthen Social and Gender justice system in India were also passed during this Session.  The Consumer Protection Bill,2019 seeks to revamp the consumer protection mechanism by repealing earlier Law and providing for establishment of Central Consumer Protection Authority to promote, protect and enforce the rights of consumers; to prevent consumer detriment arising from unfair trade practices and to initiate class action including enforcing recall, refund and return of products besides additional provision for ""mediation"" as an alternate dispute resolution mechanism to cope up with the drastic transformation of consumer markets for goods and services.  The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill, 2019 extends the benefits of reservation as available to persons residing in the areas adjoining actual line of control to the people residing in the areas adjoining international border. The Protection of Children form Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill, 2019 makes punishment for the sexual offences against children more stringent which may extend upto twenty years or in certain cases imprisonment for remainder of natural life besides declaring depiction of child in pornography as crime. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 which declares the triple talaq/talaq-e-biddat void is a major step towards grant of gender justice to the Muslim women.  


 


	National Security - So as to strengthen National Security apparatus and striking a balance between National Security aspects and Human Rights the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Bill, 2019, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2019 and Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2019 have been passed during this Session.


 


	Economic Sector/Ease of doing Businessmeasures - The New Delhi Arbitration Centre Bill, 2019, the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2019 and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment)Bill, 2019 promote and strengthen the   alternate dispute resolution system and Non Performing Asset management system respectively and as such are a big leap forward for facilitating the ease of doing business and confidence building among investors.  The Special Economic Zone (Amendment) Bill, 2019 seeks to include ""Trust or Entity"" within the definition of person under the parent Act so as to expand the scopeof entrepreneurs who can setup units in SEZ. The Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2019 provide comprehensive mechanism to ban the unregulated deposit schemes other than deposits taken in the ordinary course of business and to protect the interest of depositors.


 


	Labour Reforms - The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 has been enacted after amalgamating the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 and is a much awaited labour reform which will facilitate the ease of compliance of labour laws thereby widening the scope of minimum wages to all workers - a big step for equity promotion and  setting up of more enterprises thus catalyzing the creation of employment opportunities.


 


	Transport Reforms - The Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill, 2019 seeks to address the issues relating to road safety, citizen facilitation, strengthening public transport, automation and computerisation besides increasing the fines and penalties for violation of provisions of the Act and to make a provision for protection of good Samaritans. The Airport Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2019 enables to adopt tariff-based bidding system for engaging private partners in infrastructure projects at airports besides amending the definition of major airport - having annual passengers' throughput in excess of three and a half million.


 


	The above result could be achieved due to excellent floor coordination in both the Houses by Ministers in the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs under the dynamic leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister. During discussion on the National Medical Commission Bill, 2019 and the Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in Rajya Sabha on suggestions being made by opposition members, Ministers concerned accepted the suggestions and moved official amendments in this respect which are perfect examples of coordination and cooperation among political parties on the floor of the House.


 


	It is also worth mentioning that now from this Session onwards departing from earlier practice of adjourning the Houses for the day in the event of death of a sitting Member of the particular House, a new practice has been developed of adjourning the House for an Hour or Two and then meeting again for transacting essential business of the day.  This has contributed for increase in overall productivity of both the Houses which has been 137% in Lok Sabha and 103% in Rajya Sabha.


 


	The extra-ordinary output of this Session has become possible due to tireless efforts of all agencies and individuals involved in the transaction of Business before two Houses of Parliament.

                The Union Minister of State (I/C) for Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region and Minister of State for Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Departments of Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh interacted with the students from remote areas of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), studying in New Delhi, today. 


Dr Jitendra Singh expressed satisfaction about the decisive step of Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, to abrogate the Article 370 in J&K. He expressed confidence that the youth of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh region would benefit from this step now. He said the students that feedback of the students from ground is very important for the Government and assured that such meetings would be held in future on a regular basis to get a feedback from the youth of the state on the pace of development on the ground.


Dr. Singh said that these kind of interactions and the ground feedback received from the students busts the myth spread by people with vested interests that Article 370 was inevitable for J&K being a part of India and the youth of the state would not accept the decision. The Minister observed that due to this misperception and negative propaganda by some anti-social elements, the youth of J&K were deprived of the fruits of development that were available to the youth from other parts of the country. The state was plagued with terrorism due to the presence of Article 370. The time has come that the youth from J&K also understand the reality and be a part of development and growth of the country, he added.

The Minister said that now better health care, education, employment opportunities for youth, better pay structure and benefits for government servants at par with central government employees would be available to the people of the state. These benefits would be given irrespective of religious, caste and creed distinctions. Dr. Singh encouraged the youth to work hard and avail these benefits, which are now available to them. He said that youth should free themselves from all fear they had in mind. 

 

Dr Singh said that Article 370 was hindrance in  development of Jammu and Kashmir. He gave example of IIT Jammu which was approved by Centre, but could not get a Director due to circumstances prevailing in the state. Similar situation was there with AIIMS, he said. Citing the case of IIM, he said that students used to leave the state for better opportunities as outsiders could not buy land and start ventures in J&K. This situation would change now, Dr. Singh assured.


Dr. Singh noted that the youth of Jammu & Kashmir have a high IQ level but were being deprived of opportunities. Their potential needs to be tapped, he said.

 

During the interaction, the students brought out particular instances of lack of development in their regions in the state and how things are now beginning  to change for better. They thanked the Minister for Government's support to students from Jammu & Kashmir, due to which they have got the opportunity to study in premier universities and colleges under PM Special Scholarship Scheme. They cited development works being undertaken on ground level in the last few years like opening of new medical colleges, national highways, bank branches, schools etc. that were distant dreams earlier.


The students expressed hope that the people who got displaced from the State would again get the opportunity to go back to their roots. They expressed hope that after abrogation of Article 370, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh would witness socio-economic development and free the people from the evil of terrorism.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region and Minister of State for Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Departments of Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the retired employees are an asset for the country and their energies should be utilised in an effective way. He was speaking at the Pre-Retirement counseling workshop and the ANUBHAV Awards, 2019 function organized by the Department of Pension and Pensioners’ Welfare, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, here today. The Secretary, DARPG and Pensions, Shri K. V. Eapen and the senior officers of the Ministry were also present on the occasion. 

Dr Jitendra Singh also presented the ANUBHAV awards, 2019 on the occasion. The Anubhav portal was created on the call of Prime Minister in 2015 with a vision to preserve rich experience of retired official in digital form. It is envisaged that their rich experience will be preserved for future generation to learn and explore knowledge on various aspects of governance, culture & development history of a particular region. An award scheme to incentivize and encourage more retiring employees to submit their write-ups was introduced in 2016 and till three annual awards ceremony has been organized. This was fourth annual award in the series. 

The Minister also inaugurated the All India Pension Adalat organised on the occasion. The Pension Adalats were also organised by various ministries and departments at different parts of the country. The Minister interacted with the nodal officers and the pensioners present at these Pension Adalats through live video conferencing. Thousands of cases were taken up during these Pension Adalats throughout the country. More than 50 centres were connected through live video conferencing with the event being organised in Delhi. During this year, at the Pension Adalat organised by the Department at New Delhi, 42 cases were taken up. These cases belonged to different ministries such as Ministry of Culture, Department of Atomic Energy, Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha secretariat, etc. The Pension Adalat brings all stakeholder on a common table i.e. the aggrieved pensioner, the concerned department, the bank or CGHS representative, wherever relevant, so that such cases can be settled across the table within the framework of extant rules. States/UTs, are also conducting Pension Adalat for All India Service retired officers. It is a strategic initiative of Department of Pension & PW within 100 days of taking over of new Government.

The pre-retirement counselling workshop focussed on educating the retiring employees about various procedures related to the retirement. These included:  pension disbursement process, transfer of pension from one bank to another, role of CPPC in pension disbursement, Bhavishya portal, Digital Life certificate, Pensioners’ Portal/CPENGRAMS and welfare schemes of DoP&PW, medical facilities after retirement, wealth management and income tax concessions & other special facilities for senior citizens. The Minister also released a Booklet titled “Know Your Retirement Benefits”. 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that pensioners are an important and valuable asset for the nation and their experience should be utilised for the benefit of country. He added that the number of pensioners is almost equal to the number of serving employees, so their (retired employees) energies also need to be channelized in a right direction. He said that in Prime Minister’s ‘New India’, these pensioners can contribute through their vision, capability and experience.  Congratulating the award winners, the Minister said that ‘Anubhavs’ (experiences) documented by them should be a subject matter of research. He said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, various initiatives have been taken for the benefit of pensioners, such as Digital life certificates, Pensions Portal, Grievance Cell for Pensioners and various other benefits for Army and CAPFs. 

He expressed happiness that the Pension Adalats are being organised throughout the country. He said that technology has been utilized by the Department for the benefit of pensioners. He stressed upon the need of Regional Pension Adalats. While interacting with the pensioners during the Pension Adalat organized by the Department here today, the Minister said  that the banks also need to be sensitised about the problems being faced by the pensioners. He also emphasized upon the simplification of procedures, so that practical problems and avoidable inconveniences of the pensioners can be resolved. 

The Secretary, Pensions, Shri K. V. Eapen said that last year, 12, 849 cases were taken up at the Pension Adalat, out of which 9,368 cases were resolved. He said that this is an initiative to ensure that the retirement becomes smooth for the pensioners.  A Pension Dashboard has been opened for monitoring and various new innovations are being done in making the grievance mechanism more effective, he added.  He said that this effort is a part of 100 Day agenda of the Government which focuses on making the life of pensioners simpler.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region and Minister of State for Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Departments of Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh inaugurated the 22nd National Conference on e-Governance 2019 (NCeG), the first ever in North East region, in Shillong, Meghalaya today. Chief Minister of Meghalaya, Shri Conrad K. Sangma also presided over the event as Chief Guest. The Conference is being attended by senior government officers from across India, researchers and eminent personalities from IT industry.

Addressing the Inaugural session of the Conference, Dr. Jitendra Singh congratulated the State Government of Meghalaya for organizing such a elaborate and successful National Conference on e-Governance. 28 states and all Union Territories have participated in this Conference, which itself is a testimony of the commitment shown by state Governments across the country towards e-Governance, he said. He proposed that the Conference adopts a ‘Shillong Declaration on e-Governance’ so that the importance takeaways from the sessions may be referred to and developed upon, in the future.

Highlighting the importance of the citizen-centric approach in service delivery, Dr. Singh said that after the current Government first came into power in 2014, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, in his early speeches, had urged to move beyond Vigyan Bhawan.  We at DARPG have been religiously following PM’s vision and holding this Conference across the country. The PM had earlier defined e-governance as easy, effective, economical and environmental-friendly governance. The ease of governance would only be possible by ‘Minimum Government and Maximum Governance’, he said. Government of India, under the leadership of Shri Modi, has been focussing on this aspect especially in the remotest corners of the country, Dr. Singh added.

Talking about important reforms taken by Ministries/Departments under his charge Dr. Singh detailed different initiatives. He said that this Government did away with the need to certify documents by government officials, a legacy of British empire. By doing this the Government demonstrated the resolve that it trusted the youth of India, the Dr. Singh said. Over 1500 obsolete rules and regulations have been done away with, which makes government functioning efficient and citizen friendly. Under Prime Minister’s guidance, many initiatives have also been undertaken by Government of India and projects like IRCTC Rail connect app and UMANG app of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) have been rolled out. Other initiatives like Jeevan Pramaan retired civil servant won’t have to travel to bank for submitting life certificate or common citizens can get to know about various schemes being implemented in their area through mobile app. 

The Minister mentioned that CPGRAMS, the grievance redressal portal of DARPG, is witnessing a significant jump in citizen complaints from what it was five years earlier. This is not because people are not happy with the government, but it is the faith that the people repose in the efficient grievance redressal mechanism. The increase in efficiency of the Government can be analysed by comparing figures of disposal of grievances which has gone up to over 95%. This proves the responsiveness of Government, he said.

Dr. Singh highlighted the importance of increasing awareness among the common people about new citizen-friendly initiatives taken by the Government. Dashboards, portals and apps have been set up by the Government to establish citizen friendly governance. The most striking example is revolutionizing the format of Prime Minister’s Excellence Awards. Because of the adoption of new format, 682 districts across the country are competing for these awards. Also, PM’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration became an occasion for a country wide competition, particularly among young Collectors of the country and has given a boost to implementation of various flagship programmes of the Government.

The Minister said that Ministry of DoNER is keeping up with the pace of digitization and service delivery through electronic means. It has constantly engaged itself with promoting e-governance initiatives that are being taken up by the North Eastern states. It has extended its support to various externally aided projects proposed by different NE States in the field of Health (Telemedicine), Education (Digitization of Classrooms) etc.

Further, the Minister added that for the last 5 years, the Government has made significant progress in the direction of achieving e-Governance mandate being discussed at the highest level. For making digital literacy universal, the Government has taken key initiatives like Aadhaar and Jan-Dhan Yojana and has laid down the target completion by 2022, i.e. the 75th Independence year of India.

Addressing the Conference, Shri Conrad K. Sangma described how application of technology is close to his heart and how important it is for achieving effective citizen centric governance. It is not the best technology that matters, but it is how best the available technology is applied for the larger good of the masses. Shri Sangma talked about the challenges of digital connectivity in the North East, especially Meghalaya. He thanked the Union Government for sanctioning new mobile towers for the State, which would help reducing the challenges of connectivity. Shri Sangma said that conferences like this facilitate pooling of great experience and best practices, that go a long way in addressing traditional challenges using new age technologies.

Shri Sangma also focussed on another aspect which is the data that the government collects for public service delivery. He noted that effective decision making depends upon the quality of data collected. It is a very important aspect of good governance. The kind of impact it can have at the grassroots is immense. He gave the example of the successful model of how technology is being used in Meghalaya in creating a database of expectant mothers, details of health infrastructure available and using that effectively to increase institutional deliveries in the state, without incurring a huge cost. This has gone a long way in improving the figures of maternal mortality rates in the state, he said. Shri Sangma also talked about the e-initiatives being initiated by the Meghalaya government for revolutionising the farming and entrepreneurship sectors in the state. Shri Sangma stressed on the need for focussing on villages and leveraging technology to make them SMART, in addition to creating SMART CITIES.

During his address, Shri Hamletson Dohling, Minister for IT and Communications, Government of Meghalaya noted that information and communication technology is a powerful tool to bring the Government and public together and ensure efficient public service delivery. He said that NCeG is an important platform to realise the huge potential of ‘Digital Dividend’ across the country. He enlisted the citizen centric initiatives taken by the Government of Meghalaya, like e-Districts; sponsoring students and local companies to increase digital literacy in the state, among others. He requested the Union Minister to continue providing Central Government’s support to realise the dream of Meghalaya establishing an IT hub in the North East.

Shri K.V. Eapen, Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), thanked the Government of Meghalaya for hosting the National Conference, a first in the North East. Talking about the importance of such large scale conferences, he said NCeG is a platform for Government officials, industry stalwarts and researchers to interact and share best practices in the field of e-Governance. Such conferences are a stepping stone towards the Government's vision to bridge the Digital Divide, enhance citizen satisfaction and participation in service delivery and bringing in more transparency to reduce corruption. Shri Eapen added that digital literacy and data security are important constituents of achieving the above vision. This conference would deliberate on these important aspects besides the importance of convergence of the efforts of the Union and State Governments in achieving 'Digital India', he added. The Secretary also gave a brief overview of the e-governance initiatives being taken in DARPG.

Shri Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary, MeitY gave a presentation on how public digital platforms have been utilised for value creation and how it has transformed the nature of Government public service delivery in the country. The presentation focussed on ‘Government becoming a Service Enabler from a Service Provider’. He gave the example of Direct Benefit Transfer saving about Rs. 1 Lakh Crore of tax payers’ money since its inception; how digital payments have been revolutionised by BHIM UPI App; how Government procurement has been made transparent by the Government e-Market (GEM) platform.

Shri P.S. Thangkhiew, Chief Secretary, Government of Meghalaya, during his address, focussed on binding Government programmes together by breaking the silos based working and using enterprise architecture approach. He stressed on the need of strengthening the digital backbone for achieving the vision of a digitally integrated service delivery architecture in the country.

The Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances and Department of Pensions, Shri K. V. Eapen and senior officers of the Ministry were also present on the occasion.  The letters were presented to 9 such candidates selected for appointment as MTS in DoPT. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government has a system of compassionate appointments where employment is given to the dependents of the deceased Government servants who have died before reaching their retirement. The appointments are given to the most suitable applicants based on their penury conditions and to support their livelihood. He expressed happiness and satisfaction that this pending process has been completed by DoPT. The Minister said that this is a human issue and this step will help these families in meeting their livelihood needs. He added that 18 such vacancies were there, out of which 9 have been selected and given appointment letters today. He conveyed his wishes to the candidates and encouraged them to work hard to contribute to the Government system.   

 

The last such appointment was made during the year 2014 against the vacancies that occurred for the year 2011. Present appointments are being made for the vacancies that occurred since the year 2012 and onwards. In total, 18 vacancies occurred during these years, for which 18 applications were received. Accordingly, in order to ensure that appointment on compassionate ground should go only to the most deserving dependents, a Sub-Committee was constituted to physically verify their penury conditions. The Sub-Committee had submitted its report on 03.05.2019. Finally, the Screening Committee met on 15th May, 2019 to assess the suitability of the applicants on the basis of the Guidelines on Compassionate appointments. The Screening Committee also considered the report of the Sub-Committee and recommended 09 most suitable applicants for appointment to the post of MTS on compassionate ground against vacancies that have arisen since 2012.

 

Thus, a very important long pending issue of appointments on compassionate ground in DoPT has been resolved within a very short span of time for which the bereaved families of the deceased employees were waiting for last 7 years.

Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today held a meeting with Australian Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Senator the Hon. Matthew Canavan. Both Ministers stressed on the importance of energy and resources in the bilateral relationship, and agreed to expand the scope of cooperation given that India offers a large energy market and Australia is rich in natural resources particularly coal and LNG, apart from Uranium. 

 



 

Shri Pradhan mentioned that India is already an importer of LNG from Australia. Given India’s major initiatives to move into a gas-based economy, there is significant scope for expanding LNG imports from Australia. He also mentioned that Indian consumer is price sensitive, and therefore affordability of LNG imports from Australia will be an important factor in enhancing cooperation in this area. Minister Canavan underlined Australia’s commitment to expand its ties with India, and highlighted its position as a reliable partner in meeting India’s energy security needs. Shri Pradhan called for greater investment flow from Australia to India and sharing of best practices.

Minister Pradhan also called for greater cooperation in the area of coking coal. He said there is need for coordination between two countries by bringing together Ministries responsible for Coal, Mines, Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel of each side to achieve greater synergy and enhance bilateral energy cooperation. He further added that India being the largest importer of Australian metallurgical coal, a favourable differential pricing mechanism should be worked out. Minister Pradhan also pointed that opportunities for collaboration will continue to expand as India’s energy mix evolves. 

 



 

The two dignitaries agreed to build further on a wide range of energy resources, which have a multiplier effect on the economy, in the coming months so that the energy pillar of bilateral engagement can be strengthened.

                The Government has implemented plethora of reforms in the past five years in the E&P sector. The Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) replacing the erstwhile New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) was approved in March 2016 and the Open Acreage Licensing Programme (OALP) along with the National Data Repository (NDR) were launched in June 2017 as the key drivers to accelerate the Exploration and Production (E&P) activities in India. Government under three (3) OALPRounds have already awarded Eighty-Seven (87) Blocks covering an area of 1,18,280 Sq. Kmwith leading E&P companies.

In continuation to its determination for reduction in import dependency of oil and gas and accelerating E&P activities, the Government notified further policy reforms in upstream sector on 28th February, 2019 to increase exploration activities, attract domestic and foreign investment in unexplored/unallocated areas of sedimentary basins and promote ease of doing business by streamlining and expediting the approval processes.

The Government has now launched the Bid Round-IVfor International Competitive Bidding from27th August, 2019which will be carried out under the revised policy framework. In this bid round,7 blocks, with an area of approximately 18,500 sq. km., are being offered for bidding to the investor community. All seven (7) blocks are based on Expressions of Interest submitted by the bidders.

Salient features of Policy Reforms cover Category Specific Bid evaluation criteria with more weightage to exploratory work programme, Category-II and III type blocks will be bided based on exploratory work programme only, shorter exploration period, concessional royalty rates to expedite oil and gas production and introduction of alternate dispute resolution mechanism.

The exploration acreage of India has been enhanced from 90,000 square kilometers in 2017 to 2,10,000 sq. km after successful completion of three OALP rounds under HELP and is expected to rise with upcoming bidding rounds. To further increase exploration acreage of India, Government has increased EoI cycles from two (2) to three (3) in a year with the revised dates of April 1 to July 31, August 1 to November 30 and December 1 to March 31.

As per the minimum work program approved by the PNGRB for the 10th round, 2.02 crore PNG domestic connections will be provided, 3578 CNG stations will open, and 0.58 lakh Inch-km steel pipeline will be laid.

Speaking on the occasion, Sh Dharmendra Pradhan said that with the 9th and 10th rounds, the country is making a giant leap in the CGD. He said that in last 5 years, the number of domestic PNG connections, CNG vehicles and CNG stations have more than doubled.   He said that India is the 3rd largest energy consumer of the world, and will become top consumer in a decade. The government aims to provide reliable, affordable, sustainable and universal access to clean fuel to all. The present share of gas in the energy mix in the country is 6.2% compared to 24% globally, and the aim is to increase share of natural gas to 15% by 2030. The Minister said that with rising consumption of energy in the country, the share of CNG will increase the most. He said that the country will continue to harness multiple sources of energy, including fossil fuels, renewables, EVs and gas. The hydrogen fuel driven vehicles have already been introduced in the national capital and several auto manufacturers have introduced new CNG models, the minister added. Even the coal will continue to have relevance, as Coal gasification plants are being set up. On the policy enablers to promote gas usage in India, Sh Pradhan said that CGD has been granted ‘public Utility’ status.  

            

Sh Pradhan said that over 5 lakh crore rupees are being invested in gas infrastructure, which includes exploration, distribution, marketing, regasification, pipeline network laying, etc.  Domestic gas production was 32.87 billion cubic metre in 2018-19, and is likely to go up to 39.3 billion cubic metre in 2020-21. Present LNG terminal capacity of 38.8 MMTPA will be augmented to 52.5 MMTPA in next 3-4 years. Long term contracts have been signed for importing LNG, and its sources are being diversified. The gas grid presently is 16,788 km, and work is in progress for additional 14,788 km.


The Minister said that suitable ambience is being created and bold policy decisions are being taken to ensure that country moves on the path of progress, import dependency comes down, and our farmers(Annadatta) become Urjadatta. On the issue of waste to energy, Sh Pradhan said that ethanol blending in petrol has gone upto 6% from 1%, and we have to take it to 20%. Bio-diesel is being promoted so as Recycle Used Cooking Oil (RUCO). 2G ethanol plants are being set up to convert surplus foodgrains into fuel. Compressed Bio-gas is another field of development. Reiterating the Government’s commitment to meet the COP-21 targets, the Minister said that the country will leapfrog next year from BS-IV to BS-VI. He said that the issues concerning the setting up of Gas infrastructure are being sorted out in consultation with the state governments.  The Minister also stressed on conservation and efficiency aspects, saying that new PNG burners can save upto 40%, compared to retrofitted burners.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production 

 

 

 Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

 


	
	
		Crude oil production by ONGC during July, 2019 was 1731.27 TMT which is 3.30% lower than the target and 3.23% lower when compared with July, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-July, 2019 was 6867.74 TMT which is 1.27% lower than target for the period and lower by 4.37% than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
	
	


 


	Electrical submersible pumps (ESP) issues in wells of NBP field and Ratna R-series. Two wells put back on production through rig intervention. Rig deployed at NBP-A well platform and rig mobilization planned for remaining wells post monsoon.
	Increase in water cut in certain wells of Heera, Neelam and B173A fields.
	Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of MH and NH Asset leading to flow restriction. 


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by OIL during July, 2019 was 273.82 TMT which is 4.83% lower than monthly target and 4.65% lower when compared with July, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-July, 2019 was 1080.44 TMT which is 4.08% lower than target for the period and 3.97% lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from workover wells and drilling wells. 
	
	


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during July, 2019 was 763.86 TMT which is 10.07% lower than the monthly target and 6.84% lower than July, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-July, 2019 was 3027.42 TMT which is 7.95% lower than target for the period and 10.88% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
	
	


 

v RJ-ON-90/1 (CEIL): Deficit is from Mangla due to delay in 45 FM-1&4 (Fatehgarh-Mangla) infills ESP failure, drilling & work over activities and water leakage. 

v Operational issues in Bhagyam and Aishwarya fields.

v CB-ONN-2005/9 (Mercator): Oil production from Jyoti-1 is stopped. Well closed for long term pressure build up study and could not be put back in production due to non-grant of EC for development campaign. 

v Jyoti-2 under workover operations.  


	Non-grant of EC (Environment Clearance) for development campaign till date leading to delay in drilling new development well.

		CPSE Refineries’ production during July, 2019 was 13424.02 TMT which is 0.90% higher than the target for the month and 3.98% higher when compared with July, 2018. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-July, 2019 was 47947.38 TMT which is 2.33% lower than the target for the period and 4.17% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:
	
	


 


	IOCL, Guwahati: Lower due to low crude receipt.
	IOCL, Barauni: Lower due to Atmospheric & Vacuum Unit (AVU-3) throughput due to Heavy Vacuum Gas Oil (HVGO) pump strainer chockage.
	IOCL, Bongaigaon: Lower due to low crude receipt.
	IOCL, Paradip: Hydrogen generation unit (HGU) and Delayed Coker Unit (DCU) interruptions.


 

3.2    Production in JV refineries during July, 2019 was 1609.70 TMT which is 1.37% higher than the target for the month but 3.88% lower when compared with July, 2018. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-July, 2019 was 6850.47 TMT which is 9.55% higher than the target for the period and 5.10% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. 

3.3    Production in private refineries during July, 2019 was 6743.31 TMT which is lower by 13.82% than the target both for the month and corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-July, 2019 was 29562.75 TMT which is lower by 0.85% than the target and corresponding period of last year.

                The Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel ShDharmendraPradhantoday released the Expression for Interest (EOI) by National Oil Marketing Companies (IOC, HPCL and BPCL) for procurement of Biodiesel, made from Used Cooking Oil(UCO). On the Occasion of the World Biofuel Day today, ShriPradhan, along with the Chief Guest–the Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Science & Technology and Earth Sciences Dr Harsh Vardhanlaunched a sticker on RUCO viz., Repurpose Used Cooking Oil and a mobile app to facilitate the collection of UCO. This year the theme of the World Biofuel Day is “Production of Biodiesel from Used Cooking Oil (UCO)”.



TheEOI onBioDiesel from UCO provides that the entrepreneurs setting up Biodiesel plants get remunerative price and assurance of complete offtake of production by the Oil companies. To be launched in 100 cities, EOI will ensure that Rs 51/ litre is paid for Biodiesel for the first year, Rs 52.7 for the second year and Rs 54.5 for the third year. The Oil companies will also bear the cost of transportation and GST for the first year.



Speaking on the Occasion, ShDharmendraPradhan said the Hon’ble Prime Minister has given a target to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to bring down import dependency of oil products by 2022, and this can be achieved by enhancing production, improving energy efficiency, promoting conservation and encouraging alternate fuels. He said that the government is promoting the alternate sources of energy in a big way. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is working on a four-pronged strategy in this regard -promoting Ethanol, 2-G ethanol, Compressed bio-Gas and Bio-diesel. ShPradhan said that the ethanol blending in Petrol has gone up from 1% to about8% and is likely to touch 10% soon. He said the Government is planning to allow production of ethanol from surplus foodgrains which now sometimes go waste and also entail expenditure on storage. On the issue of compressed biogas, the minister said that CGD network being set up in over 400 districts will give a big fillip to it, and already 300 letter of intents have been signed with entrepreneurs for setting up CBG plants. Describing Bio-diesel as low hanging fruit in the scheme of alternate source of energies, the minister said that abundant raw material is available for the purpose. It is a good waste to wealth concept. He said that the budget this year has underlined the transformation of Annadata to Urjadata. 



Mentioning about the PradhanMantriUjjawala Scheme, ShPradhan said that the Scheme will achieve its target of 8 crore beneficiaries by October this year, well before the deadline. He said that the scheme has environmental, economic, social and health benefits. Similarly, the scheme of collecting the Used Cooking Oil and its conversion to biodiesel will have environmental, economic and health benefits, besides helping the country attain self-sufficiency. He called upon the OMCs to support the entrepreneurs in their endeavor, as the biodiesel production also promotesswacchhbharat mission. The minister complimented the Ministry of Health in joining hands with the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, in taking up the projects concerning the health of the people.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Harsh Vardhan enumerated number of technologies developed within the country to convert the waste into useful products. He said that PMUY has helped millions of people in improving their health. The Health Minister emphasized on enforcement, educating and raising awareness about perils of repeatedly using cooking oil, besides offering incentives for disposing it in productive, useful and safe manner. There is need to develop societal movement around it, he added. He said that the Government has launched Eat Right India campaign, and there is need to extend it Eat Less also. 

The RUCO sticker launched today will imply that the establishment having it conforms to the RUCO ecosystem, and does not reuse the cooking oil. The RUCO App will enable stakeholders to track and trace all transactions.

                World Biofuel Day is observed every year on 10th of August to create awareness about the importance of non-fossil fuels as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels and highlight the various efforts made by Government in the biofuel sector. Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas will organize World Biofuel Day on 10th August 2019 at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi. Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas & Steel Shri. Dharmendra Pradhan will inaugurate the programme. Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Science & Technology and Earth Sciences Dr Harsh Vardhan will be the Chief Guest of the function. This year the theme of the World Biofuel Day is “Production of Biodiesel from Used Cooking Oil (UCO)”.

Biofuels have the benefits of reduction of import dependence, cleaner environment, additional income to farmers and employment generation.  Biofuel programme also compliments Government of India’s initiatives for Make in India, Swachh Bharat and increasing farmers income.  A number of initiatives have been undertaken to increase production and blending of biofuels since 2014.

In India, the same cooking oil is used for repeated frying which adversely affects the health due to formation of polar compounds during frying. These polar compounds are associated with diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, liver diseases among others. UCO is either not discarded at all or disposed off in an environmentally hazardous manner choking drains and sewerage systems. 

The National Policy on Biofuels, released by the Government of India in 2018, envisages production of biofuel from UCO. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is implementing a strategy to divert UCO from the food value chain and curb current illegal usage. The benefits of transformation of UCO will help bring health benefits as there would be no recycling of the UCO, employment generation, infrastructural investment in rural areas & cleaner environment with reduced carbon footprint.

At present, approximately 850 crore litres of High Speed Diesel (HSD) is consumed on a monthly basis in India. The National Policy on Biofuels - 2018 envisages a target of 5% blending of Biodiesel in HSD by 2030. In order to achieve the blending target, 500 crore litres of Biodiesel is required in a year. In India, approximately, 22.7 MMTPA (2700 crore litres) of Cooking Oil is used out of which 1.2 MMTPA (140 Crore) UCO can be collected from Bulk Consumers such as hotels, restaurants, canteens, etc. for conversion, which will give approximately 110 crore litres of Biodiesel in one year. Presently there is no established collection chain for UCO. Thus, there is a huge opportunity in production of biodiesel from UCO.

To facilitate the production of Biodiesel from UCO, the Oil Marketing Companies shall float an Expression of Interest (EOI) for procurement of Biodiesel from Used Cooking Oil across 100 cities. The purpose of inviting this EOI is to encourage the applicants to set up Biodiesel producing plants from Used Cooking Oil (UCO), processing plants and further utilizing the existing potential of UCO based Bio-diesel in India. 

On this occasion, a sticker on RUCO viz., Repurpose Used Cooking Oil and a mobile app to facilitate the collection of UCO shall also be released by FSSAI.

Interactive sessions on Second Generation Ethanol & Biodiesel from UCO shall also be held. The sessions will focus on issues and hurdles being faced by the sector and dwell on how to overcome these hurdles for effective implementation of the blending program across the country.

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has said that India’s growing energy sector is attractive for foreign investors. Speaking at Bloomberg NEF New Delhi Summit today, he said that it has repeatedly received funding from Sovereign Wealth Funds, Pension Funds, long-term strategic investors from Western countries, Asian Countries and the Middle East. “The economy projected to grow at more than 7%, will attract more funding. Many companies have successfully raised funding through overseas bond market and this funding route is likely to grow manifold going forward.”, he added.



 

The Minister said that India’s upstream sector is an important focus area of the government.  Several transformative policy reforms have been undertaken to revitalize the E&P eco-system and establish a conducive business environment, which would facilitate more investment and boost domestic oil & gas production. “The key policy reforms undertaken to augment the domestic oil and gas production include the policy of uniform licensing, marketing and pricing freedom to the operators, availability of comprehensive data to the investors to take informed decisions and fiscal incentives with the thrust on production enhancement.”, Sh Pradhan said.

Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said India remains a bright spot in the global economy. With strong domestic economy and supportive policy environment, the Government is committed towards achieving holistic, inclusive and sustainable economicdevelopment.India will become 3 trilliondollar economy this year and aims to achieve a 5 trillion dollar target in the near future. To achieve this target, India needs secure, affordable and sustainable energy to sustain thehigh growth and provide energy access to 1.3 billion people. Therefore, it is important for us to tap every source of energy.“We have taken several measures to overhaul the hydrocarbon sector to ensure energy security for the country while pursuing a green path to progress.”, the Minister said. 

On the issue of energy landscape, the Minister said that it is passing through a big change - making way for clean energy technologies. “In a drive to provide energy access to all in a sustainable manner, our Government has taken a big responsibility by making global commitment to reduce emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 – 35% from 2005 levels. One of the main strategies India is planning to adopt towards achieving this goal is by having 40% electricity generation capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.”, Shri Pradhan said.

Appreciating the oil and gas companies for investing in developing renewable energy projects for self-consumption and for supplying to the grid, Shri Pradhan said that. Oil Marketing Companies are providing soft loans and subsidies to petrol pump dealers to install solar rooftops. He said “This is the right time to think of sale options like blending electricity generated from gas power plants with renewable energy. This will further aid the process of emission reduction.”

Shri Pradhan said the Government is committed towards clean energy, which extends beyond justelectricity. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana has transformed the lives of millions of poor households by ensuring access to clean cooking fuel.  “More than 75 million LPG connections have been provided under the Ujjwala Yojana so far, which has resulted in enhancing the LPG penetration in India to around 95% as against 56% in May 2014.  The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana has saved millions of women and children from the health hazards of smoky kitchens”, he said.

On the issue of city gas network, Shri Pradhan said thatonly 20% of the populationwas covered under it in 2014 but with the success of the 10th CGD Bid Round, CGD network will expand to nearly 70% of our population. CGD would be available in 228 geographical areas comprising 402 districts spread over 27 States and Union Territories covering 53% of the country.The recently-concluded 9th and 10th CGD rounds will require investment of one lakh twenty thousand crore rupees. 

The Minister said that many of our refineries are today close to large urban clusters, and as part of their focus as good corporate citizens, all have shifted to cleaner natural gas for their energy needs. In addition, the government has already implemented fuel efficiency norms for commercial heavy vehicles. “To tackle pollution issues, we are looking at gas-based transportation solutions. We are switching to BS-VI fuels from 1st April 2020. The National Capital Territory of Delhi has already switched to BS-VI fuels in April last year. We are promoting the use of CNG, bio-CNG and LNG in transportationsector. We are setting up bio-refineries and targeting newer sources of ethanol. The ethanol-blended program will enable OMCs to sell 10% blended petrol.”, Shri Pradhan said.

On the bio-diesel programme, the Minister said “I am confident that we will soon be rolling out initiatives to enable achievement of 5% biodiesel blended diesel across country.” He said “we will promote EVs, but it will be a holistic and integrated planning, where I have mentioned in my recent statements that all forms of transportation, which are clean and affordable, will be considered in our Energy Policy.”

The Minister said “we are mindful of the difficulties being faced by investors in some instances where State Government is trying to renegotiate some of the executed contracts. Our Government has requested State Governments to reconsider their decision, as this will jeopardize future investment in not only the concerned state but also the country as a whole.”

                “Development of North-Eastern India is on high priority of the Union Government and a well developed power sector is prerequisite to the economic development in these States”, said Shri RK Singh, Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy (IC) and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship. Shri Singh was speaking at the meeting of Chief Secretaries and Principal Secretaries of Power of North-Eastern States in Guwahati today. The meeting was also attended by the senior officers of Power Ministry and the representatives of the DISCOMS.

In his opening address, the Minister recalled the achievements made during the past 3-4 years in power sector.  However,he cautioned that concerted efforts will have to be made to make the system sustainable.  In order to redeem our pledge for 24/7 power, we will have to reduce the losses and make the DISCOMS viable. He cited example of some of States which had huge commercial losses but have been able to bring down the losses to 15% or below. He urged NE States to adopt smart and prepaid meters to avoidpower theft. He assured all the assistance from the Central Govt. to the State Govts. in creating power infrastructure in NE States.The Minister further stated that grant for Central Government schemes will be made available to only those states who undertakes reforms, viz, reduction of losses etc. 

North-Eastern India has a huge hydro potential and the State Governments have a major role in hydro-projects by way of facilitating land acquisition and implementing the resettlement& rehabilitation plans. He assured full support for development of hydro-power in the region and called upon all stakeholders to work in close coordination so as to optimally harness the hydro potential. Development of hydro projects in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh had contributed to the prosperity of those States. Similarly, NE States can reap long term benefits out of developed hydro projects.

              During the meeting, the Minister reviewed various power sector schemes & projects under implementation in the North-Eastern States, such as, Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), DeenDayalUpadhyay Gram JyotiYojana (DDUGJY), Pradhan MantriSahajBijliHarGharYojana (Saubhagya) and R-APDRP. He noted the gaps and directed concerned agencies to speed up the completion of pending work and advised State Governments to extend necessary help in getting statutory clearances. It may be noted that new projects worth Rs.1797.43 crore have been sanctioned under IPDS for the region. The Minister thanked the States for their cooperation in implementation of the schemes & projects and assured of full support in future in this regard.

            On this occasion, a power purchase agreement was also signed between Government of Arunachal Pradesh and NHPC Limited for supply of power from 2000 MW Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project.

                Around 500 representatives from Industries across the country participated in the vendor meet organized by the research wing of Indian Railways, Research Designs and Standards Organization (RDSO) in Lucknow today. The special Mega Vendor Meet was held to expand vendor base and spread information on greater business opportunities in Railways Sector.

Further, detailed presentation on Online Vendor Approval process of RDSO and steps taken for enhancement for “Ease of doing Business” and details of items having less than three (3) sources was given. It was informed that, RDSO has already initiated some measures to encourage vendors to register themselves for RDSO controlled items with less than three sources. For example, registration charges for items with less than three sources has been reduced from Rs. 1,50,000/- to Rs. 10,000/- for micro/small enterprises and from Rs. 2,50,000/- to Rs. 50,000/- for others. Moreover, product testing charges shall also be borne by RDSO for such items. 

Key industry representatives were also invited to speak on this occasion to give their views/ suggestions on Vendor Approval System, which have been taken note of for resolution. 

Physical display of several of the items having less than three sources was also done in the meet, for providing a good clarity to the prospective bidders.

One-to-one interaction of Industry with senior officials of RDSO was also to give good insight about the various products and vendor approval process.

As part of the event, Chairman Railway Board Shri V.K. Yadav also addressed the participants and delegates through video conferencing and exhorted the industry fraternity to be a partner in progress of Indian Railway and strengthening IR’s supply chain. He said that without support from Industry, IR could not perform. Success of Indian Railways goes hand in hand with success of Industry. He asked industry to tell what more is required by them. He said we are trying to streamline the complete cycle of purchase from vendor registration to e-procurement to product inspection to payment. He however, cautioned that we need quality product and poor quality shall lead to de-registration. After de-registration, registration shall be made very difficult.

The Chief Guest for the meet Addl. Member /Stores/Railway Board, Shri O.P.Khare said that huge industry participation in this vendor meet is beyond imagination. Considering the size of the country, it is surprising that there are several items with less than three approved sources; at the same time it is an opportunity for industry. He said Indian Railways is growing fast, but this is not possible without active support from industry. This will go a long way towards “Make in India” programme of the government. He said RDSO’s efforts must be appreciated and industry should take full advantage for mutual benefit of both.

Sh. Virendra Kumar, DG/RDSO in his speech talked about the various steps taken by RDSO to expand the vendor base, especially of items having less than three Vendors and enhancement in doing ease of business, in line with Government of India’s ‘Make in India’ programme. This will bring competitiveness and reduce cost of procurement and cost of service.  He said that as a result of proactive action taken by RDSO, average time for registration has reduced significantly.  At the same time, about double the number of vendors are doing registration on RDSO portal.

He also apprised the august gathering that we have set up a monitoring system for addressing and solving grievance and complaint from vendors.  He promised to the participants from Industry that if you are fair, we shall be fair. Together, we can succeed.

Overall the meet was a roaring success, which witnessed enthusiastic participation of Industry Fraternity from across India and will go a long way in fulfilling the stated objective of Expanding Vendor Base of Indian Railways.

                The research arm of Indian Railways, Research Designs and Standards Organization (RDSO) is organizing a special Mega Vendor Meet at RDSO in a significant move to show-case greater business opportunities in Railway sector in Lucknow on 30th August, 2019. Industries from across the country are invited for this vendor meet to encourage their participation in Indian Railways supply chain development.  No participation fee for attending the meet has been kept to ensure wider participation. In line with Government of India’s ‘Make in India’ programme, RDSO through such meets and other endeavors continues to reach out to Indian industry and encourage them to be the active partners in nation building.

In the meet, special focus will be on those RDSO controlled items which have less than three (3) RDSO approved vendors. This list has been put on RDSO website www.rdso.indianrailways.gov.in.

During the meet, RDSO shall make presentation about “Enhancement for ease of doing business”. The meet shall make available a platform for direct one-to-one interaction and discussions of Industry with RDSO. Live display of selected RDSO items shall be kept at the meeting venue.

            For wider proliferation of information about this Vendor meet, following actions have been taken:


	Intimation has been sent to Industrial bodies, such as FICCI, CII, ASSOCHAM, IEEMA for spreading awareness and inviting participation of Industries in the Meet.
	GMs and PCMMs of Zonal Railways and PUs have been requested to bring it to the notice of prospective vendors and encourage their participation. Standees and posters have been displayed in Zonal Railways and Division’s offices.


It may be worthwhile to mention that RDSO has already initiated some measures to encourage vendors to register themselves for RDSO controlled items with less than three sources. For example, registration charges for items with less than three sources has been reduced from Rs. 1,50,000/- to Rs. 10,000/- for micro/small enterprises and from Rs. 2,50,000/- to Rs. 50,000/- for others. Moreover, product testing charges shall also be borne by RDSO for such items.

                The Government has approved Ministry of Railways plan to construct the New Line between Vaibhavwadi – Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) (108 km) with an estimated cost of Rs. 3,439 crore. The project will be completed by 2023-24 and will be executed by Construction Organization of Central Railway. 

 

The proposed alignment from Vaibhavwadi to Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) passes through the districts of Kolhapur, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg of Maharashtra state. The proposed alignment would link Kolhapur railway station (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) on the existing Pune-Kolhapur section of Central Railway with Vaibhavwadi Railway Station on the existing Roha-Madgaon section of Konkan Railway. The proposed link would reduce the distances for thermal coal transportation for a number of power plants in Maharashtra and Karnataka. 

 

The addition of Vaibhavwadi-Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) is expected to directly benefit the districts of Belgaum, Ballari, Bijapur, Gulbarga, Latur,  & Solapur and create a shorter evacuation route to western ports as there is a lack of Rail connectivity between Central and Konkan regions leads to longer supply routes for power plants in the Northern Karnataka and Southern Maharashtra region which affects supply coming from ports like Mumbai, JNPT, Krishnapatnam and New Mangalore due to longer rail route of Ratnagiri-Panvel-Pune route. 

 

Kolhapur cluster, as part of western Maharashtra, has a vibrant industrial belt which consists of manufacturing based industries, auto parts and ancillary, sugar manufacturing, textiles, edible oil processing factories etc. With the increased industrial development in and nearby area of west coast, imports are going to increase in future. Also, with the proposal of world class infrastructure coming up at Jaigad and Vijaydurg on the west coast, the district would be benefitting immensely. Thus, with the advent of the Vaibhavwadi-Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) line and the upcoming Vijaydurg port, Gulbarga, Adilabad and the nearby industrial clusters will be able to exploit the closeness to west coast. 

 

There will also be reduction in distance and time taken for freight trains running on the existing Vaibhavwadi-Roha-Pune route and Miraj-Pune-Panvel-Pen route if the same is routed via the Vaibhavwadi–Kolhapur (now Shri Chhatrapati Shahumaharaj Terminus) project line. This project will also generate employment direct during construction for about 26 lakh mandays.

                The Government has given its approval for increasing the speed of the Delhi-Mumbai route (including Kanpur-Lucknow) to 160 Kmph’ at a total cost of Rs. 6,806 cr by 2022-23. This will ensure improved speed, service, safety and create capacity. As part of Mission Raftaar, Indian Railways is working in mission mode to improve the average speed of trains across the network. Increasing the speed of the Delhi-Mumbai Section to 160 Kmph will ensure upto 60% increase in average speed of passenger trains and doubling of average speed of freight traffic.

 

The 1,483 Kms long Delhi-Mumbai Route passes through 7 states, namely Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The travel time between New Delhi and Mumbai will be reduced by 3.5 hours, now making it a fully overnight journey. Increasing the maximum speed of the Delhi-Mumbai route will also give further impetus to semi-high speed trains. It will allow such trains to unlock their full potential and travel at a speed of 160 Kmph, to ensure passengers have best in class speed and service. In addition, it has been found that the safer LHB coaches too can be made fit for this speed.

 

The scope of the project includes fencing, Automatic Train Protection System (ETCS 2/TPWS), Mobile Train Radio Communication, and automated and mechanised diagnostic systems, which will considerably enhance safety and reliability. Besides the above main inputs, the policy also requires removal of all level crossings which are being eliminated otherwise under a separate plan head. 

 

The entire project has been structured on a new approach of route wise single composite work with single agency execution, and complete funding through  Extra Budgetary Resources - Institutional Finance (ERB-IF). With improved funding, better coordination, economies of scale, and induction of state of the art technology, the project will be completed in 4 years from the date of approval.  Furthermore, work along the line will be planned with minimum disruption of traffic, ensuring passengers and businesses are least affected during the construction phase.

 

The project will help boost employment during the construction phase with more than 3.6 crore mandays to be generated directly. It will also help kick start an economic multiplier that will give a boost to growth in all states. The project will also lead to an increase in throughput on the route by 30-35%, paving the way for PPP models in the future. 

 

As a part of Mission Raftaar, Government has also granted similar approval for the Delhi-Howrah route, which together with the Delhi-Mumbai route account for 29% of passenger traffic and 20% of freight traffic. Railways is also working to cover the complete Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals of Indian Railways, which consist of 16% of the total Indian Railways Network, but account for 52% of total passenger traffic and 58% of total freight traffic.

As a part of Mission Raftaar, Government has also granted similar approval for the Delhi-Mumbai route, which together with the Delhi-Howrah route account for 29% of passenger traffic and 20% of freight traffic. Railways is also working to cover the complete Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals of Indian Railways, which consist of 16% of the total Indian Railways Network, but account for 52% of total passenger traffic and 58% of total freight traffic.

He said 63 clauses which do not require framing of new rules, have been sent to Law Ministry for vetting. Subject to clearance from Law Ministry, these clauses are likely to be implemented from 1st of next month. These clauses deal with penalties, licences, registration, National Transport Policy etc. Regarding the other clauses for which rules have to be framed, the Minister informed that steps for this have already been initiated by the Ministry, and rules will be notified as and when due processes are completed. The Minister expressed happiness that the Motor Vehicles Act 2019 has become a reality, and said this will go a long way in giving the country a safe and corruption free road transport system.

It is a ‘bank-neutral’ FASTag i.e. no bank is pre-assigned to the FASTag at the time of purchase by customer from a Point-of-Sale or Online and offers the flexibility to customer to link the FASTag with their existing bank account by using My FASTag Mobile app, currently available on Google Play Store.

National Highways Authority of India organised a road show for the third phase of Toll-Operate-Transfer project for prospective bidders in New Delhi today. The TOT bundle 3 comprises of nine stretches traversing a total length of approx. 566 kms in UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu. This phase has initial mandated capital works approx. Rs 400 crore lower than Bundle 1 and Bundle 2 which will lead to significant savings for investors. Almost 43 per cent of bundle length is under annuity for almost 8-10 years which will lead to saving on at least one major maintenance cycle.

Stretch 1 and 2 connecting Jhansi to Lalitpur in Uttar Pradesh on NH 25 and 26 has a total length of over 99 kms. Stretch 3 connecting Lucknow to Raibareli in Uttar Pradesh on NH 24B is 70 kms long. Stretch 4 connecting Kotwa to Muzaffarpur in Bihar on NH 28 has a length of 80 kms. Stretch 5 connecting Hazaribagh to Ranchi in Jharkhand on NH 33 is about 74 km long. Stretches 6,7, 8 and 9 connecting Madurai to Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu on NH is over 243 km long.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairman of NHAI Shri Narendra Nath Sinha said, the government has taken initiatives to increase the investment in highways sector since 2014. Transport sector has been allocated enhanced outlay of Rs 83,000 crore in the Union Budget for development of roads and highways in the country. The remaining funding requirements to meet ambitious plans are being managed through private sector investments.

Shri Sinha said, several more bundles will be offered in the months to come. He called upon the private investors to bid for these bundles, saying TOT is a risk-free model. He also invited investors to come up with more innovative investment models for the infrastructure sector. Exhorting investors for qualitative improvement, he called upon the concessionaires to concentrate upon improving road safety, quality of maintenance and improving toll collection methods so that waiting time at toll plazas is cut down drastically.

National Highway projects having approximately 6400 k.m. of length have been identified under Toll Operate Transfer Model. The first bundle of nine projects, totalling approximately 681 kms of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded in 2018. Huge interest was shown by foreign investors. TOT Bundle-I was awarded to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority’s estimate. The second bundle of over 586 kms spread over four States – Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar with 12 toll plazas across four highways was also offered last year. Bid for TOT Bundle-3 has been invited with due date of 11th September, 2019.

                The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has issued notification no GSR 547(E) dated 1st August 2019, exempting the armoured and other specialised vehicles of Indian armed forces and paramilitary forces from the new stringent vehicular emission norms (BS-VI) which are set to take effect from 1st April, 2020. The Ministry has also granted exemption to these vehicles from BS-IV compliance. 

The exemption has been granted because these vehicles operate in remote and inhospitable terrains with most challenging operational and environmental conditions.Due to security challenges and requirements of specialized operations, the development of suitable engine compliant with the above norms would require considerable time. Further, it is difficult to maintain ideal transportation and storage conditions of fuel in these conditions.

Earlier, the Government, vide G.S.R. 485(E) dated 19.05.2017, had exempted motor vehicles used for Government purposes relating to the defence of the country from BS- IV norms and, vide G.S.R. 871(E) dated 13.09.2018, had exempted special purpose vehicles (armoured and other specialised vehicles) used for operational purposes for maintenance of law and order and internal security from BS-IV norms, for a period up to 31st December, 2019.

                India has become the first country in the world to issue Biometric Seafarer Identity Document (BSID), capturing the facial bio-metric data of seafarers. Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, MoS (I/C) Shipping and Chemical & Fertilizers launched the project in New Delhi today. He also handed over the new BSID cards to five Indian seafarers. 

The new facial biometric technology is a marked improvement over the two finger or iris based bio-metric data, with modern security features.  It will make the identification of the SID holder more reliable and efficient, while protecting their dignity and privacy.  India had made a presentation on this technology at ILO .

Speaking on the occasion Shri Mandaviya said that the country is moving ahead rapidly under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The shipping sector is seeing major developments  in the areas of coastal shipping, inland waterways and other maritime activities. This is leading to generation of employment in the sector, which  is evident in the growing number of Indian seafarers in the international shipping industry. The total number of Indian seafarers who were employed on Indian or foreign flag vessels increased from 154349 in 2017 to 208799 this year, showing an unprecedented increase of 35%.  

Shri Mandaviya said that today's development is very significant againt the backdrop of the increase in seafaring activities . The new document will give a foolproof identification to our seafarers which will facilitate their movement, provide ease of getting jobs and help in identifying them from any location in the world.

The new  card is in confirmation of the Convention No. 185 of the International Labour Organisation  on BSID. India ratified the Convention in October 2015. 

The BSID introduces modern security features.  It will have a biometric chip embedded in it. The security of the BSID card  is ensured at various levels and through different methods. At the time of data capturing the live face is cross matched through passport photo using a face matching software. The card has two optical security features- Micro prints/micro texts and Unique Guilloche pattern. A software has been developed for capturing the facial biometrics and its authentication through the public key infrastructure. 

A record of each SID issued will be maintained in a national database and its related information will be internationally accessible.

In India the BSID project has been taken up in collaboration with Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Mumbai. The Government notified the Merchant Shipping (Seafarers Bio-metric Identification Document) Rules in  2016. The issuance of SID involves the collection of biometric and demographic details of the seafarers, their verification and then issuance of the card  to them. 

Nine data collection centers have been setup  at Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Noida, Goa, New Mangalore, Kochi, Vizag & Kandla for issue of BSID.  Every Indian seafarer who possesses a valid Continuous Discharge Certificate issued by the Govt. of India will be eligible for issue of a BSID. The total number of existing Indian seafarers who will be required to be issued BSIDs is around 3,50,000 . All the existing seafarers will be given BSID within the next 2 years. After this, it is estimated that  around 15000 new seafarers will be issued BSIDs annually  .

                The foundation stone for an additional Liquid Cargo Jetty was laid at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust in Mumbai today, by the Union Minister of State for Shipping (Independent Charge), Shri Mansukh Mandaviya. The project is being undertaken to cater to the increased demand for handling of liquid cargo like POL, LPG, edible oil, molasses and chemicals etc. in the country. It will provide berthing to ships carrying liquid cargo. The new liquid jetty will be built at a  cost of about Rs 309 crore. 

​

Addressing the gathering, Shri Mandaviya said, “The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has laid focus on port-led development. Keeping this in view, India’s ports are being developed and modernized in line with global best practices.” 



“There is an increased domestic and industrial demand for liquid commodities like LPG etc in the country, with PM’s plans to reach gas stoves to every home.  The present liquid cargo capacity of JNPT is around 6.5 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA). The new terminal for which foundation is being laid today, will increase this capacity by 4.5 MTPA.  This will help to better fulfill national requirements and be good for the port too ”, said the Minister. 



Earlier, the Minister attended meetings with CEOs of all Terminal Operators, port users, service providers and JNPT officers. This was Shri Mandaviya’s  first visit to Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), India’s number one container port, after taking over charge of the Shipping Ministry. The main goal of the visit was to interact with various stakeholders in order to gain a comprehensive overview on the overall port operations, recent developments and the strategic roadmap ahead for JNPT to become  amongst the best ports globally.



After the foundation stone laying ceremony, the Minister visited the fourth container terminal (BMCTPL) and JNPT SEZ Site.

Chairman, JNPT, Shri Sanjay Sethi was also present on  the occasion.

                The Minister of State for Shipping (I/C) and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya and  Minister of State (I/C) for Tourism & Culture, Shri. Prahlad Singh Patel discussed  the immense potential for  maritime tourism in the country. In a  meeting between the two Ministers held in New Delhi yesterday, the two  ministers  emphasised  the need to promote the important tourist destinations in the coastal areas of the country through coastal tourism .

It was decided in the meeting to set up a committee of senior officials of the two Ministries to explore the avenues for coastal tourism  in the country and work out ways to promote the same. It was also  decided to explore  the possibilities and opportunities in the areas of  Coastal Tourism, Cruise Tourism, Sea Sports, Light House Viewing Gallery.  It was suggested that every coastal area can create a calendar of events for  tourist engagement, with activities like beach volleyball, sand art, food festivals, dances of the fishing community, to name a few.

The Shipping Ministry is promoting tourism in maritime states under the Sagarmala Programme. This is being done in convergence with the Ministry of Tourism and Tourism Development Departments of maritime state governments.

These new, unexplored tourism areas will open a door to coastal communities of the maritime states where they will find many new and diverse job opportunities. In the coming years, coastal and maritime tourism will be a source for growth and job creation in the coastal states of India. 

The two Ministers  also underscored the need  for better coordination and synergy between their respective Ministries so that desired results can be achieved in a time bound manner.

Congratulations to the other participants too for having embodied the true spirit of participation and giving it their best. All of them have shown that India has a young and competent workforce ready to define new limits.  I would also like to thank all the individuals and the corporates who were involved with the participants and made this win possible.”

                 Urging ministers and representatives from 40 nations to make the most of a global platform aimed of youth displaying their skills across trades, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Hon’ble Minister for Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE), said it is critical for governments and industry to come together to turn skilling into a ladder for economic growth for all countries. He said that nations can leverage from India’s demographic dividend and India’s youth can contribute to their growth and development. Dr. Pandey was addressing a summit of ministers from different countries at Kazan, Russia, where the WorldSkills International Competitions, a biennial event, is underway. A 48-member Indian team is participating in the competition played out over six days across trades like namely mobile robotics, prototype modelling, hairdressing, baking, confectionary & patisserie, welding, brick laying, car painting, floristry, etc.

Addressing an audience comprising government representatives of 40 other countries at a Ministers’ Summit organised along the side lines of the competition, Dr. Pandey said India is making all efforts necessary to utilise the potential of its unique demographic dividend. “India is a young nation with the median age of 27.6 years. We will have the largest working population during 2022-2034. We have adapted global standards of skilling to strengthen the young workforce with competent skills,” he said. “We have undertaken several initiatives to provide opportunities for the workforce, including prominent international recruitments to enhance their skill level.” 

Participants at the Ministers’ Summit included Ms. Tatyana Golikova, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation; Ms. Olga Vasilyeva, Minister of Education of the Russian Federation; Mr. Jos de Goey, Vice President for Strategic Affairs and Chair of the Strategic Development Committee at WorldSkills International; Mr. Tang Tao, Vice Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, People’s Republic of China, among others. 

Making a strong case for India as the next skilling hub, Dr. Pandey said, “Currently, 10 million Indian youth enter the workforce every year. Upskilling and increasing industry interface to provide access to multiple skilling opportunities in a short time frame is critical. India has adopted accelerated modular competency-based programs of 200-600 hours duration aimed at enhancing the employability of youth coming out of these programs. We are also laying emphasis on industry-led apprenticeship programs so youth directly entering the labour market are trained on in-house bridge courses by industry.”

Dr. Pandey stressed that a fruitful partnership between Government, industry and academia is essential to synergize the skills and zeal of the youth. 

India has collaborated with several countries to ensure a young workforce is exposed to international best practices and different working environments. In October 2017, MSDE signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Japan to initiate the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) facilitating Indian workers to gain experience and learn from their peers in the country. TITP promotes international collaboration through transfer of skills, technology and knowledge among countries, contributing towards human resource development. NSDC has also collaborated with the Emirates Driving Institute (EDI) in the UAE. Besides setting up driver training institutes in India, the partnership also aims to address the need for quality drivers in the UAE and other countries in the Middle East.

Dr Pandey also inaugurated Skill India Pavilion at WorldSkills, Kazan in Russia, showcasing the multicultural experiences of India and unity in diversity which is the beauty of our nation. Skill development will further strengthen the bilateral relations between India and Russia.

                The 48-member Indian Team representing the country at WorldSkills Kazan 2019 was given a grand send-off at a ceremony in the capital today, organized by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under the aegis of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), to motivate the participants as they gear up to pit their skills against the best in the world. India is the sixth largest team that will take part in the competition.

Nearly 1,500 competitors from 60 countries will compete in 56 skill competitions at this mega event in Kazan, Russia on August 22-27. The 48-member Indian team will participate in 44 skills, including mobile robotics, prototype modelling, hairdressing, baking, confectionary & patisserie, welding, brick laying, car painting, floristry, etc. Forty-four experts and 14 interpreters are also accompanying the participants to Kazan. In 2017, a 28-strong contingent took part in the WorldSkills International at Abu Dhabi, winning one silver, one bronze and nine Medallions of Excellence. 

Addressing the candidates Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, said, “My heartiest congratulations to the 48 of you who have proven your mark at the national level. You all will now represent the country at the world’s biggest skill competition in Russia. My advice to you is to compete in the true spirit of participation and make India proud on the global platform and at the same time learn from your international peers competing with you. You are the brand ambassadors of India and your victory will be an inspiration for every Indian youth who aspires to make it big in their life. Participating at events of such scale adds to the larger cause of skill development which is integral to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of a Skilled India.” 

“I am happy to learn that we have six young girls also bearing the flag of the country at Kazan. I am positive you will inspire many more and we will see increased female participation in the years to come. I also hope with Team India’s participation at WorldSkills, the event will gain the same level of popularity in the country, as the Olympics and the Asian Games,” he added.

The desire to excel in the trades of their choice has played a crucial part in the candidates realising their dream of performing at a global stage. Mohammed Rabith from Malappuram, Kerala is one such example of grit and determination. The 22-year-old whose father works as a coolie and mother is a homemaker, aims to make his parents and his country proud by winning the gold medal in Wall & Floor Tiling Skill at the WorldSkills. Stories like Rabith are abound in the Indian team, where the spirit of youth is motivated by aspiration and the desire to excel.

Himanshu Vohra, a final-year civil engineering student from Chitkara University in Punjab, is representing India in Plumbing and Heating Trade. Himanshu’s passion and interest in plumbing has taken him to multiple competitions, including Global Skills Competition in Australia, before he found himself as a contender for the WorldSkills in Russia.

About 75% participants come from tier II and tier III cities, with 25% from rural areas. Most belong to humble backgrounds, parents work as farmers, coolie, daily wage laborers and security guards. Among states/UTs, Maharashtra tops the chart with seven contestants participating in the competition, followed by five from Karnataka and four from Uttar Pradesh. Over 50,000 youth had registered for the IndiaSkills Competitions that was organized across several legs last year.

Participants spoke about their experiences at the send-off. Present among the audience were proud parents who greeted them with loud cheers as the Minister felicitated all 48 contestants. 

The 48 contestants have been shortlisted through a series of contests conducted at district, state, regional and national levels over the past year. These candidates were provided extensive training in skills ranging from Wall and Floor Tiling, Brick Laying, Cabinet Making, Car Painting, CNC Turning, Hair Dressing, Welding, Restaurant Service, Beauty Therapy, Auto-body Repair to Mobile Robotics, Mechatronics, Prototype Modelling, Visual Merchandising, etc, by leading corporate entities with NSDC acting as a facilitator and have been gained extensive support from Sector Skill Councils, Industry and Corporates.

Candidates have been exposed to international training with industry support from over 100 companies. More than 100 companies have Renowned experts such as Vinesh Johny - Chef/Trainer, winner of Forbes 30-under-30; Samantha Kochhar, renowned beauty expert and director of Aroma Magic; JP Shroff, Chairman of Kushal Credai; Seema Jhaveri, Director of IFD and Vaishali Shah, Principal of LTA Beauty School came together to prepare the contestants for the mega-event. Leading organisations such as Maruti, Mahindra, Toyota, Daikin, Saint Gobain, Tata Motors are among the 100+ partners which have extended support via infrastructure, equipment, expert trainers, facilities, training and more.

A robust IT system namely “Skill India Portal” has also been developed under SANKALP to capture and converge skill data.

Hon’ble Minister mentioned that efforts need to be taken for strengthening the District Skilling ecosystem. He mentioned that the perception of youth towards skilling needs to be improved and suggested that District Skill Committee (DSC) should play a pivotal role in counselling youth in their districts.

He mentioned that the training of the trainers is a key component of the ecosystem and same needs to be strengthened. 

Hon'ble MoS, Shri Raj Kumar Singh, carrying forward the suggestions made by Dr. Pandey, mentioned that the skill training centres should have quality infrastructure and the certificate issued to the candidate should be valued.

In the Year 2013, ALIMCO with its observation and the past experience of more than 40 years (since its inception in the year 1972) felt the need to upgrade, restructure and modernize its facilities as most of the ALIMCO’s infrastructural resources such as plant/machinery, civil construction, electrical work, manufacturing technology product profile etc. have completed their life cycle or have become obsolete, in addition to inadequate and inappropriate human resources. 

Ever since the new government took the charge in the year 2014, the project of modernization of ALIMCO took the fast track and in July 2015 an estimate cost of Rs. 338 Crores was approved by Government of India for the modernization Project. Planning for Plant & Machinery initiated immediately afterwards and foundation laid on 14th October, 2014. Out of total planned budget of Rs. 338.04 Crores, so far approx. Rs. 115 Crores (33%) has been utilized. Out of total budget of Grant in Aid of the Rs.200 Crore will be released by Ministry and balanced amount of Rs 138 crore will abide by ALIMCO from its internal accruals.

With hole hatred support of DEPwD, ALIMCO in financial year 2018-19 achieved a turnover of Rs. 341.87 crores as against Rs. 228.50 crores in 2017-18 and earned surplus of Rs. 75.29 crores as against Rs. 50.79 crores earned surplus in the year 2017-18. The excess of income over expenditure amounting to Rs 75.29 crores has been carried forward to the Reserve and Surplus Account for utilization and furtherance of its objectives of the Corporation.

                Sixteen State Governments signed MoU with Ministry of Textiles at a function in New Delhi today to take Samarth - Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS) forward.

Eighteen States have agreed to partner with the Ministry under the scheme out of which Jammu & Kashmir and Odisha were not presentduring today’s function.  Initially, the Ministry has allocated over 3.5 lakh targets to the agencies nominated by State Governments to implement this scheme. After the training employment will be provided to all these beneficiaries in various textiles related activities. The programme covers the entire value chain of the textiles sector except spinning and weaving.

The training programme involves advanced technology oriented features like Aadhaar Based Biometric Attendance System (AEBAS), CCTV recording, dedicated Call Centre, Mobile App based Management Information System and on-line monitoring.

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister of Textiles and Women and Child Development, SmritiZubinIrani, said that the signing of MoUs with State Governments shows the commitment of the Ministry to extend its support to the state agency and make them equal partners for building the spirit of national development to boost the textiles sector.

SmritiZubinIrani further said that the targets set out by some of the States like Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand are much below the requirement of skilled workers in textiles industry in those states and urged them to relook at the targets. She said that the Ministry will try to ensure that those who are not employed by the industry may get additional benefits provided by financial services under Mudra scheme. She said that the resolve to skill over 4 lakh people is a big step and every effort must be made to achieve it. The Minister said that she will be visiting the training facilities in different states to take stock of the situation.

SmritiZubinIrani also said that 75% of the workers engaged in the textiles sector and 70% of the beneficiaries of the Mudra loan are women. She further addedthat North Eastern States must focus on silk and jute sector and review the targets of skilling under Samarth scheme.

Secretary Textiles, Ravi Capoor, in his address said that India is a very small player in the global market and there is huge potential of employment generation in the textiles sector. Secretary Textiles informed that there is a gap of 16 lakh trained skilled workers in textiles industry. He further added that high standards have been set out in theSamarth scheme for the skilling of the workers so that they are readily employable by the industry. He said that the level of training has to be very good so that the objective of providing meaningful employment to the skilled workers is fulfilled.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message on skill development under Samarth scheme was read out during the function.  A short video film on the scheme was screened on the occasion. A souvenir was also released during the function. 

The Ministry of Textiles, as part of the Government’s broad focus on skill development, implemented the flagship scheme (2010 to 2017) of skilling in textiles sector, Integrated Skill Development Scheme with a target to provide 15 lakh additional skilled workers to the textiles sector by 2017. Under the scheme 11.14 lakh persons were trained by March, 2018 and 8.41 lakh persons were provided placement. 

With a view to leverage the institutional capability created by the Ministry and the synergy / collaboration achieved with the industry and the state governments, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs gave its approval for a new skill development scheme, titled “Samarth” - Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS)"" from 2017-18 to 2019-20. It is a placement oriented programme for meeting the skill requirements of textiles industry. The scheme aims at skill development of 10 lakh youth upto 2020 in the entire value chain of textiles, excluding spinning and weaving in the organized sector, with a projected outlay of Rs. 1300 crore.

The National Handloom Day is observed annually on 7th August to honour the handloom weavers in the country and also highlight India’s handloom industry. National Handloom Day seeks to focus on the contribution of handloom to the socio economic development of the country and also increase the income of weavers.

The Union Government had declared 7th of August as the National Handloom Day in July 2015 with the objective of generating awareness about the importance of the handloom industry to the socio economic development of the country. August 7 was chosen as the National Handloom Day to commemorate the Swadeshi Movement which was launched on this day in 1905 in Calcutta Town Hall to protest against the partition of Bengal by the British Government. The movement had aimed at reviving domestic products and production processes.

The first National Handloom Day was inaugurated on 7th August 2015 by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, at the centenary of Madras University in Chennai.

                Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has published an Indian Standard for identification, marking and labelling of Pashmina products to certify its purity. The Standard is being released in Leh, today.

In a message Union Minister of Textiles and Women and Child Development, Smriti Zubin Irani said that the certification will help curb the adulteration of Pashmina and also protect the interests of local artisans and nomads who are the producers of Pashmina raw material. It will also assure the purity of Pashmina for customers.

Smriti Zubin Irani said that BIS certification of Pashmina will go a long way in discouraging counterfeit or substandard products presently mislabeled and sold as genuine Pashmina in the market.

Textiles Minister further said that it is a step in the right direction and will ensure better prices for the goat herding community in Ladakh as well as for the local handloom artisans producing genuine Pashmina products, currently a disadvantaged lot due to rampant marketing malpractices. 

The nomadic Pashmina herders live in the hostile and tough terrain of Changthang and are solely dependent on Pashmina for their livelihood. At present, there are 2400 families rearing 2.5 lakh goats. This initiative of hallmarking Pashmina will protect the interests of these families, motivate the younger generation to continue in this profession as well as encourage more families to take up this occupation. 

Ladakh produces 50 MT of the finest grade of Pashmina in the world (12-15 microns) and this initiative will provide further impetus towards value addition of Pashmina in Ladakh.  Ministry of Textiles is processing a proposal for funding of Rs. 20 crore for a de-hairing plant for Leh which along with this initiative will lead to progress in the Pashmina sector in Ladakh. 

The Changthangi or Pashmina goat, is a special breed of goat indigenous to the high altitude regions of Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir. They are raised for ultra-fine cashmere wool, known as Pashmina once woven. The Textiles are handspun and were first woven in Kashmir. The Changthangi goat grows a thick, warn undercoat which is the source of Kashmir Pashmina wool – the world’s finest cashmere measuring between 12-15 microns in fiber thickness. 

These goats are generally domesticated and reared by nomadic communities called the Changpa in the Changthang region of Greater Ladakh. The Changthangi goats have revitalized the economy of Changthang, Leh and Ladakh region.

                The one-day National Conference of Tourism Ministers concluded successfully in New Delhi today.

The conference was attended byState Tourism Ministers of 19 States, Secretaries of Tourism and senior officials from the States and Union Territories (UTs) who deliberated on various issues related to the development and promotion of Tourism.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the Tourism Minister urged for better coordination between Centre and States to increase number of tourists in India. Highlighting the importance of perception, Shri PrahladSingh Patel said that we need to change the perception of India in the mind of foreign tourists which will yield us good results for promotion of tourism. He asked the States to organize surveys in their respective States to understand how the foreign tourists perceive India and should work towards removing negative impressions, if any. The Minister stated that all of us together have to make concerted efforts to realise the Prime Minister’s dream of doubling the tourists, both foreign and domestic over the next five years.

 

The Tourism Minister launched the Hindi version of the new Incredible India portal at the conference today. He announced that the Arabic, Chinese and Spanish versions of the new Incredible India website will be launched next month. The new Incredible India website was launched on 14th June last year. Since its launch, the website has attracted 85,84,928 total visitors including 65,31,722 Unique Visitors as on 31st July, 2019.

 

Addressing the participants, Shri Patel also urged all the Sates and UTs to follow the norms of UNESCO while making proposals for Heritage site of their sites with the help of ASI.The Minister said that we have great potential in our natural sites and we should focus on adventure tourism to attract more tourists in this sector. He also said that recently, in order to promote night tourism, the Culture Ministry has decided to open 10 historical monuments till 9 PM for common visitors across the country. He also urged all the States and UTs to open their important monuments till late night for visitors.

The Tourism Minister launched the Incredible India Tourist Facilitator Certification (IITFC) portal during the conference. The Incredible India Tourist Facilitator Certification (IITFC) Programme is a digital initiative of Ministry of Tourism, Government of India for the citizens of India to become a part of the booming Tourism Industry. It is an online programme where one can learn about tourism at their own time, space, path and pace. The successful completion of this programme would enable the learner to become a Certified Tourist Facilitator of Ministry of Tourism, Government of India.

 

The Tourism Minister also handed over three new Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) and five new Letters of Intent (LoIs) to the prospective Monument Mitras at the conference today.

 

The Conference provided a platform for the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India to apprise the States / UTs about new initiatives taken and those in the pipeline, to get valuable feedback from the States / UTs on the same, to highlight areas where active cooperation of the States / UTs is required and at the same time to learn about the initiatives being taken by the States / UTs for the development of Tourism.

 

Discussions were held with the States / UTs to get their inputs and feedback on the following subjects:-


	Developing an all-encompassing One Stop Solution including information on tourism related services through a web based application and a Grievance Redressal Mechanism through Twitter and Tourist-Helpline
	Adoption of Adventure Tourism and Bed & Breakfast / Homestay Scheme Guidelines by States/UTs

                Aadi Mahotsav (National Tribal Festival), a joint initiative of Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India & Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) begins at Polo Ground, Leh-Ladakh today. The 9 day event from 17th August till 25th August, 2019 was inaugurated by Shri Arjun Munda, Union Minister for Tribal Affairs in the august presence of SmtRenuka Singh, Minister for State for Tribal Affairs and Shri R. C. Meena, Chairman TRIFED.

The theme of the festival is: “A celebration of the spirit of Tribal Craft, Culture and Commerce”. TRIFED essentially is to play the role of a ‘Service provider’ & ‘Market Developer.

Delivering inaugural address, Shri Arjun Munda said that the national object of inclusive development (sabkavikas) includes the development of tribes as an important component. Our constitution enjoins upon the Government the responsibility of addressing the special needs of the tribals. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is committed for the overall development of tribal people across the country who are deprived of the benefits of the many schemes of the government. The Government plans to setup 3000 Van DhanVikasKendras (VDVK) across the country in 2019-20 which include 13 VDVKs planned to setup in Ladakh, the Minister added.

He wished grand success to the AadiMahotsav in Leh-Ladakh.

In her address, SmtRenuka Singh said that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will organize many more such AadiMahotsav in all State capitals and in other parts of the country in the near future which will benefit large population of tribal people of our country in all respects. She said that now the products of Tribal artisans are being marketed all over the country through 104 retail outlets run by TRIBES India and to 190 countries across the country through Amazon, with whom TRIBES India has an agreement.

The inaugural event had two reputed local cultural troupes presenting Ladakhi folk dances. The troupes performedJabro Dance - a nomadic dance and song of people inhabiting eastern Ladakh and Spawo dance, a heroic song and dance associated with a legendary hero of Himalayan region called K’sar. Further on in the coming days other dance performances like Flower Dance, Abex Dance/song, Ghazal Dance, Aleyyatoo will regale the visitors.

The first of its kind event in Leh-Ladakh will see around 160 Tribal artisans from more than 20 states across the country, actively participating and showcasing their masterpieces.

These products can then be marketed all over the Country through the 104 retail outlets run by TRIBES India across the country and 190 countries across the world through AMAZON, with whom TRIBES India has an agreement.

The tribes constitute over 8% of the country’s population. This is a very significant number. In real terms it corresponds to over 10 crore Indians. Moire than 70% population of Ladakh region are tribes. The government has conceptualized of organizing AadiMahotsav in Leh-Ladakh in Arptil 2019. 

As the name of this event AadiMahotsav suggests, it is the ‘adi’ factor that is important about them. The Adivasi way of life is guided by primal truths, eternal values and a natural simplicity. The greatness of the tribes lies in this that they have managed to retain the primal skills, the natural simplicity. Their creations issue from the depths of time. This quality gives their arts and crafts a timeless appeal. The crudest tribal handicraft instantly touches a primal instinct in all of us. This is particularly true of tribal music and dance. 

The Tribal Artisan Mela (TAM) has been organized during the currency of the event for livelihood generation of tribal artisans of Ladakh. During TAM, the artisans were identified and empanalled for their products selected for marketing through retail chain of network of TRIFED and also connect them for participating in the National Tribal Festivals which are being organized in all major cities/towns in the country.

                Shri Arjun Munda, Union Minister for Tribal Affairs inaugurated a “National Workshop on Tribal Enterprise with focus on Honey, Bamboo and Lac” organized by TRIFED and M/o Tribal Affairs here today. Smt. Renuka Singh, MoS for Tribal Affairs, Shri Deepak Khandekar, Secretary, M/o Tribal Affairs and Shri Pravir Krishna, MD, TRIFED were present. Shri Munda released the ‘Flyers and Reports on (1) Bamboo and Bamboonomics ; (2) Lac; and (3) Honey on the occasion. National Workshop was organized to fine-tune its action plan on the Promoting Tribal Enterprise on Bamboo, Honey and lac.



Delivering inaugural address, Shri Arjun Munda said that the focus of such efforts should not be confined to job creation only but should focus on fulfilling the needs of the market. Support system and research should be market driven and equilibrium should be maintained between the demand and supply in the market. For these products, markets should be innovation and research based. The quality and prices of the products should also be maintained properly. The tribals should be treated as entrepreneurs and efforts should be made to upgrade them in technology.



Addressing on the occasion, Smt. Renuka Singh said that such initiatives will strengthen ‘Van Dhan Vikas Kendras’. The integration of ‘Van Dhan, Jan Dhan and Pashu Dhan’ will reform the lives of tribals considerably. Van Dhan scheme has the cluster of Self Help Groups to support tribals and is the mainstay for their family income who are living in and around the forest areas.



Shri Deepak Khandekar in his welcome address said that the reason behind Bamboo, Honey and Lac taken up for Van Dhan Scheme is that, these commodities are already having existing markets which enable producers i.e. tribal entrepreneurs catch on to the chain of procurement- primary level processing-storage value addition and marketing. 

After inaugural session, Technical Sessions were held on the Bamboo Products, Lac Products and Honey in which experts presented their Presentations on the success stories, production, use and business related to these products.National Workshop was an initiative to formulate a strategy for establishing tribal enterprises based on skill and local resources available particularly in Bamboo, Honey and Lac. In the workshop, National and International experts deliberated and gave their views and ideas for establishing implementable and commercially viable Tribal Enterprises. The expert insight and deliberation will explore the significance of Bamboo, Lac and Honey to address livelihoods of tribal communities across the country. The workshop also introduced feasible technologies and process for production of value-added products from Bamboo, Lac and Honey. 

Bamboo

India is the world’s second largest cultivator of bamboo after China, with 136 species and 23 general (out of which about 19 care indigenous) spread over 13.96 million hectares. According to the Union Ministry of Agricultural and Former Welfare, India’s annual Bamboo production is estimated at 3.23 million tons. Poor yield of Bamboo is one of the perennial problems in India. In contrast to China’s average yield of 50 MT/Ha, the maximal yield range in India is 10-15 MT/ha. This shows that there is lot of scope for bamboo enterprise based on the good stock. The bamboo is used in different types of products and it is a very good earning option for the tribals, for which necessary seed money, facilities and expertise need to be provided to tribal artisans. The Bamboo Enterprises can give immediate results leading to substantial increase income of tribal artisans. 

Honey

""As per the latest data from the ‘National Bee Board’ under the Department of Agriculture, the country's total honey production reported in 2017-18 was 1.05 lakh metric tonnes, compared to the 35,000 metric tonnes in 2005-06. The major part of it comes from Apisdorsata. With international demand for honey growing, India exports 50 per cent of the commodity and in the last 12 years, exports have increased by 207 per cent. India has exported 61,333.88 MT of natural honey worth Rs.732.16 crores i.e. USD 105.48 million dollars to USA, Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia. Morocco, Qatar Germany, UK, Japan, France, Spain and Italy being the main markets .

The tribals can be provided with trainings along with tools and kits for scientific extraction/collection and processing of honey from the beehive and thus the tribal SHGs can play a crucial role in this regard. Besides collaboration with KVlC, there is a need to collaborate with the forest departments for wild honey collection and protection, conservation and propagation of the tree species like Adina cardifolia and Trivia nudiflora that are preferred by bees to nest colonies.  

As per the latest government estimates, large scale employment in the beekeeping sector is estimated to generate around 3 lakhman-working days by maintaining 10,000 bee colonies. The honey is an excellent source of earning and TRIFED is committed towards Prime Minister’s vision of a “Sweet Revolution” by way of making people prosper though production and trade in honey. 

Lac

""Lac resin was once imported in sizeable quantity into Europe from India along with Eastern woods. It has been seen that the Lac is mostly cultivated by poor tribals to supplement their agricultural income. Lac cultivation in India is mainly confined to the states of Jharkhand which contribute 57% of the total production, followed by Madhya Pradesh at 24% and the balance 19% is contributed by Maharashtra, Orissa and West Bengal. This cultivation has proved to be a subsidiary source of income for the tribals. In the mid-1950s. Indian annual production was about 50, 000 tons of stick lac and export about 29,000 tons of lac. By the late 1980s, the figures were about 12,000 tons and 7,000 tons  respectively. However, during 1992-93, Indian lac exports fell further to 4,500 tons only. On the contrary, during the same period, the countries like Thailand & China were able to increase their lac exports. Presently Indian lac export is almost non-existent, which needs to be revived. Lac with its availability and possibilities of cultivation in tribal areas has a great potential in creating livelihood and income generation opportunities for tribal communities.

                The Food and Nutrition Board, Ministry of Women and Child Development, is organizing a number of activities on the theme “Empower Parents, Enable Breastfeeding” during the World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) being observed from 1st to 7th August 2019. The focus this year is on protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding. 

Activities like Annaprashan Ceremony and Quiz competition on IYCF are being conducted in 30 States and Union Territories through 43 Community Food and Nutrition Extension Units of Food and Nutrition Board, involving the State functionaries of Health Department, Home Science Colleges, Medical Institutes, Universities, NGOs and other stakeholders. 

The objectives of World Breastfeeding Week are:


	To create awareness among the parents about breastfeeding
	Encourage parents to adopt breastfeeding
	Creating awareness about the importance of initiation and exclusive breastfeeding, and adequate and appropriate complementary feeding
	Providing advocacy material about the importance of breastfeeding. 


Breastfeeding is important because:


	It promotes better health for mothers and children alike.
	It prevents infections like diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in early infancy and thus reduce infant mortality
	It decreases the risk of mothers developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease and
	It protects infants from obesity-related illnesses, diabetes and increases the IQ.


The correct norms of infant and young child feeding are:


	Initiation of Breastfeeding within an hour of birth
	Exclusive breastfeeding for first six months of life i.e. only breast Milk ‘NO’ other milk, food, drink or water
	Appropriate and adequate complementary feeding from six months of age while continuing breastfeeding
	Continued breastfeeding up to the age of two years or beyond


The activities being organized during the World Breastfeeding Week are symposiums for lactating mothers and anganwadi workers to create awareness about the importance of breastfeeding, annaprashan ceremony of babies at anganwadi centres by collecting beneficiaries from adjoining anganwadi centres, competition on nutritious recipes and quiz competitions.

Apart from this, exhibitions, on nutrition, displaying low cost nutritious diets for infants and young children will also be organized at grassroots level. Awareness generation on healthy eating, maintenance of hygiene and sanitation and its importance will be held for pregnant and lactating mothers. In addition to this, awareness programmes will be held at the village level through puppet shows, skits, dance and drama, films, slide shows, AV Spots and rallies.

This important nutrition intervention will help in breaking the vicious cycle of malnutrition and aid the Government to achieve National Nutrition Goals and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030. According to WHO, increasing breastfeeding to near-international levels will help in saving more than 800 000 lives every year, the majority being children under 6 months.

                Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today launched the Fit India Movement today, on the occasion of National Sports Day, at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, New Delhi, in the presence of thousands of people from all walks of life. The Prime Minister said that ‘Fit India Movement’ should become a national goal. In an effort to inspire the nation, the Prime Minister said that Fit India Movement may have been started by the government but it is the people who have to take the lead and make it a success.

Among those present at the event included Union Minister of Rural Development, Agriculture and farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, Union Minister of Human Resource Develoment ShriRamesh Pokhriyal‘Nishank’, and Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Kiren Rijiju. Live telecast of the programme ensured participation of people across the country. 

Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Shri. Kiren Rijiju welcomed the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, saying that he has been an inspiration for this movement. The Prime Minister had mentioned about the Fit India Movement in his latest edition of ‘Mann kibaat” on 25th August, 2019.  A strong and progressive India calls for a fit India, the minister said. Shri Rijiju said everyone needs to be mentally and physically fit.

The inaugural address was followed by a high-energy half-hour programme in which India’s rich indigenous heritage of sports and dance forms was showcased, and their importance in enhancing fitness was highlighted. Sporting activities like kushti, kabaddi, gatka, kho-kho, mallakhamb, kaliryapattu, and many others sporting activities have been instrumental in improving the fitness quotient among Indians. Besides, men and women have traditionally been involved in participating in various regional dance forms during festivals, which have also contributed towards the enhanced fitness. With technological advancements, fast-moving lifestyles and the advent of mobile phones, these indigenous forms of fitness are fast losing their popularity, but these can be a great way to remain fit. The show stressed on the need to give up sedentary lifestyles and be active in daily life. 

Envisioned by the Prime Minister, the nation-wide Fit India Movement aims to motivate every Indian to incorporate simple, easy ways of staying fit in their everyday life.The highlight of the function was the presence of National Fitness Icons, who have been hand-picked by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports for their continued dedication towards fitness, despite their age. 101-year-old Mann Kaur, who still runs marathons, 81-year-old Usha Soman who can still do push-ups and runs marathons with her son, were among the 20 fitness icons, chosen to motivate citizens to lead a fit life. Recipients of this year’s Sports Awards were also present at the event.

In keeping with the spirit of the event, thousands of school children, cyclists, joggers, runners, aerobic dancers thronged the grounds of the IG stadium in the morning itself and displayed a range of fitness activities.

Congratulating the winners of the awards and greeting everyone on the occasion of the International Youth Day, Sh Rijiju said that the Ministry is organizing various programmes to motivate youth, under the guidance of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narender Modi ji. The National Youth Awards Function is one such programme. He stressed that India is a young country filled with immense potential. The development of the country is in the hands of youth who can shape its future. If the energy of youth is channelized in right direction, the progress of country in various fields can gain momentum, and youth can become prosperous. The Minister said that the youth are idealistic, aim high and when they achieve their goals through their efforts, it becomes necessary to grant recognition to their efforts, which has been attempted through this program.

                To supplement the efforts of Jal Shakti Ministry, NITI Aayog has prepared the second Round of Composite Water Management Index (CWMI 2.0).The Report was launched today by Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Minister of Jal Shakti, and Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog.  

Shri Ramesh Chand, Member, NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Jal Shakti Ministry; Shri U.P. Singh, Secretary, Jal Shakti Ministry; Dr. Amarjeet Sinha, Secretary Ministry of Rural Development; Shri Yaduvendra Mathur, Special Secretary, NITI Aayog, Shri Avinash Mishra, Adviser, Water and Land Resources, NITI Aayog and senior officials of Ministry Jal Shakti, Rural Development and NITI Aayog were also present at the launch event.

Scientific management of water is increasingly recognized as being vital to India’s growth and ecosystem sustainability. Government is being proactive about water management and has created the Ministry of Jal Shakti to consolidate interrelated functions pertaining to water management. The newly formed Jal Shakti Ministry under the guidance of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has strived to over bridge the water challenges by launching the Jal Shakti Abhiyan - a campaign for water conservation and water security. 

NITI Aayog first launched and conceptualized the Composite Water Management Index in 2018 as a tool to instill the sense ofcooperative and competitive federalism among the states. This was a first ever attempt at creating a pan-India set of metrics that measured different dimensions of water management and use across the lifecycle of water. The report was widely acknowledged and provided actionable guidance to States on where they were doing well absolutely and relatively and what they needed to focus on to secure their water future.

The CWMI is an important tool to assess and improve the performance of States/ Union Territories in efficient management of water resources.  This has been done through a first of its kind water data collection exercise in partnership with Ministry of Jal Shakti, Ministry of Rural Development andall the States/ Union Territories.The index would provide useful information for the States and also for the concerned Central Ministries/Departments enabling them to formulate and implement suitable strategies for better management of water resources.  

CWMI 2.0 ranks various states for the reference year 2017-18 as against the base year 2016-17.In the report released today, Gujarat hold on to its rank one in the reference year (2017-18), followed byAndhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.  In North Eastern and Himalayan States, Himachal Pradesh has been adjudged number 1 in 2017-18 followed by Uttarakhand, Tripura and Assam. The Union Territories have first time submitted their data and Puducherry has been declared as the top ranker. In terms of incremental change in index (over 2016-17 level), Haryana holds number one position in general States and Uttarakhand ranks at first position amongst North Eastern and Himalayan States.On an average, 80% of the states assessed on the Index over the last three years have improved their water management scores, with an average improvement of +5.2 points.

The overall ranking for reference year 2017-18and change in the rankings from the base year 2016-17 of different States in the Report is given in Charts-1 and Chart 2.

Inspired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s impetus on Jal Sanchay, Jal Shakti Ministry on 1st July, 2019  launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyaan a campaign for water conservation and water security in 1592 water stressed blocks in 256 districts, to ensure  important water conservation interventions. To supplement the efforts of Jal Shakti Ministry, NITI Aayog has prepared the second Round of Composite Water Management Index (CWMI 2.0).  

The CWMI is an important tool to assess and improve the performance of States and Union Territories in efficient management of water resources.

This was a first ever attempt at creating a pan-India set of metrics that measured different dimensions of water management and use across the lifecycle of water.

                NITI Aayog, the premier think tank of the Government of India, has launched the Fourth Edition of Women Transforming India (WTI) Awards, in collaboration with the United Nations in New Delhi today. UN Resident Coordinator in India, Ms. Renata Lok-Dessallien, opened the nomination process for WTI Awards 2019, in the presence of CEO NITI Aayog, Mr. Amitabh Kant, senior government officials and partners of Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP).

The applications for the awards are now live, and nominations can be filed on behalf of individuals or by the individual themselves at https://wep.gov.in.

The WTI Awards, since its inception in 2016, has been recognising and celebrating stories of exemplary women from across India. The theme for WTI Awards 2019 is “Women and Entrepreneurship”, in continuation with last edition’s theme that recognizes women entrepreneurs who are breaking the glass ceiling and challenging stereotypes, through businesses and enterprises and are providing innovative developmental solutions to building a dynamic New India.

Whatsapp has collaborated with the WEP for the WTI Awards of 2019, and will be providing support equivalent toUS$100,000 to the winners. 

The campaign builds on the success of the WTI Awards for the past three years. WTI Awards 2018 received more than 2,300 nominations. Through a highly objective and rigorous selection process, 15 women entrepreneurs doing inspirational work from diverse sectors viz. Renewable Energy, Education, Sanitation, Art and Culture, Social Innovation and Impact, were recognised. The first two editions of the WTI Awards felicitated 12 phenomenal stories each of women undertaking phenomenal work to transform societies across India’s cities, towns and villages; and empowering themselves and their communities.

Addressing on the occasion, Mr. Amitabh Kant CEO NITI Aayog said,“WTI Awards is a flagship initiative of NITI Aayog. For the past three years, we have been celebrating the power of women and recognising their efforts in championing the cause of their societies. The next wave of disruption in India’s start-up ecosystem would be led by women-led enterprises. I am personally invested in ensuring the success of winners of the WTI Awards”. 

 

 



Calling Women Transforming a movement, Ms Dessallien said, “We chose women’s entrepreneurship as our theme because at the heart of these Awards, this movement rather, is the idea that women lead change. I believe that if there is any one group, which can decisively accelerate India, and the world’s, achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, it is India’s women. The over half a billion women are not a target audience. They are not the recipients of development. They are stakeholders. Their full and equal participation changes conversations, the way we talk about development; it transforms politics and decision making; it improves policy.”

                The Q1 figures for 2019-20 (April to June 2019) show a real GDP growth rate of 5.0%.        

Reacting to this, the Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), Bibek Debroy, said that a lot of unnecessary negativism was being generated about the economy. It is true that there are global uncertainties and net exports cannot, right now, be a major growth driver for India. Despite this, in 2019-20, real GDP growth is expected to be between 6.5 and 7.0%. This range isn’t one projected only by government institutions and those who work for the government. Those external to the government have also projected similar ranges of growth. When many countries in the world are struggling to find positive growth, 6.5 to 7% is not to be lightly dismissed.

To make a dent on poverty and increase job growth, real rates of growth need to be more. Bibek Debroy stressed that several reform measures introduced by the government are meant to address precisely this question, both the cyclical and structural aspects. When economists list out structural constraints, they often mention factor markets, which are in the State List or the Concurrent List. Alternatively, they concern the legislature or the judiciary. Therefore, because these reforms are complicated areas, reforms will happen incrementally, not overnight.

Just last week and today, the Union government has announced several measures to achieve higher growth. Bibek Debroy highlighted reforms in the financial sector and taxation procedures. Indirect tax reform will occur through GST Council and the Task Force on Direct Taxes has already submitted its recommendations. The government has announced its intention to privatize central public sector enterprises, adhere to fiscal consolidation and review central schemes on public expenditure. The macro fundamentals of the economy are sound and these measures will begin to show results in a couple of quarters.

Therefore, Bibek Debroy stressed that those who seek to spread a message of gloom and doom are doing a great disservice. The EAC-PM does not endorse such views. While constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome, a message of despair and hand-wringing is best avoided. Bibek Debroy expects real growth in 2019-20 to be around 6.5%, increasing to 7% in 2020-21, because growth in the second half of the year is likely to be more than the first.

                The usage of data by people in e-commerce needs a careful oversight as when combined with modern technology, it gives unprecedented market power to the platforms which can be used for benefits of consumers as much as it can be used for causing harm to them, said Dr Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog, here today at the workshop on ‘E-commerce: Changing Competition Landscape in India’, organised by Competition Commission of India (CCI). 

In such a scenario, it becomes imperative for CCI and other regulators to work closely with the industry in order to be prepared to deal with challenges. He also advocated the need for liberal FDI regime in e-commerce.

In his Keynote Address, Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog, congratulated CCI for carrying out the e-commerce market study underscoring the need for research-based policymaking for enabling evidence based regulation. He stated that presently India is the ninth-largest e-commerce economy with the potential to reach the number two position as we move ahead with penetration of Internet in the rural areas. Addressing e-commerce to be the sunrise sector, he emphasized the role of policymakers and regulators in facilitating the e-commerce explosion in a manner that is beneficial to the buyers, sellers and consumers. He touched upon how e-commerce benefited various stakeholders such as the logistics industry, farmers, and women entrepreneurs. He also emphasized that with the growth in GDP, there exists ample space for both online and offline retail to co-exist. Commenting on the strategies adopted by conglomerate e-commerce platforms, he stressed that CCI has a greater role to ensure that their market power do not lead to monopoly situation. 

Earlier in his welcome address, Shri Ashok Kumar Gupta, Chairperson, CCI, outlined that market studies are a way to proactively reach out to the market participants and better understand a sector and identify reforms required in that sector based on informed policymaking and one that does not blunt the incentives of the market participants, creates a level playing field and promotes efficiency. He emphasised that while growth of e-commerce has the potential to increase competition, to bring about information transparency, to greatly enhance consumer choice and to prompt and facilitate innovation in business models, but at the same time, like any other market, digital markets are not impervious to anti-competitive conduct. Thus, competition authorities do have a role to play in ensuring that these markets remain open and contestable. He stated that in digital sector, there is a need to preserve firms’ ex ante incentives to invest and this applies to both incumbents as well as potential entrants and thus a myopic view of competition cannot be taken. Price effects alone do not help gauge market dynamics. Quality, innovation, and now increasingly data are important dimensions of competition that can have far-reaching effects. Chairperson also mentioned that in the ongoing debate on how digital markets should be looked at, it requires a study as to how distinct these ecosystems are from the traditional market configurations and what ought to be the parameters of competition analysis. Whether they should be based on regulations or case-by-case application of competition law would suit the needs better. He said that the whole object of the study and this workshop was to make this debate less abstract and more driven by practical insights. 

The interim observations emanating from the e-commerce study by CCI were presented in the Inaugural Session capturing the key trends that have emerged to guide meaningful deliberations in the ensuing sessions. The broad issues of platform neutrality, platform to business terms and discount structures in the online ecosystems of product retail, hotel booking and food ordering and delivery were touched upon in the presentation. 

The inaugural session, was followed by enriching panel discussions dedicated to specific e-commerce businesses, namely, online food delivery, online hotel booking and online retail shopping. The panels comprising, senior officials from e-commerce and on-line platforms, senior journalists covering e-commerce sector, think tanks, representatives of related industry and trade associations, professionals from hospitality sector and distinguished bureaucrats, extensively deliberated on the issues and challenges faced in the e-commerce sector and the need for ensuring and preserving competition both within the e-commerce market place and in its interface with traditional markets.

The day-long workshop was conducted by CCI in pursuance of its larger mandate of protecting and promoting competition and fair play in markets, and as a part of its market study launched in April 2019 for better understanding of the e-commerce ecosystems in India, business practices of online platforms and other market participants that avail the platforms’ intermediation services and their implications on competition.

The workshop concluded with a discussion on the symbiotic relationship between policy and regulation and its bearing on the competitive landscape.

                Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman said here today that Competition Commission of India (CCI) should ensure Indian enterprises are safeguarded from abuse by entities operating from other jurisdictions. Smt. Sitharaman was speaking at the 10th anniversary celebrations of the CCI.

Smt. Sitharaman said that CCI must keenly observe market developments around the globe as borders no longer determine competition in a country. She said competition policy is a big challenge at the international level with the nature of operations of companies. Big corporate companies have jurisdiction in one country and ground operations elsewhere and this causes huge challenge for regulators.

She praised the CCI for performing remarkably with restraint and without obstructing competition in an open economy like India. She also lauded CCI on credibly handling its responsibility till now and asked it to be ready for CCI 2.0 mode. She said that CCI 2.0 can help foster healthy competition by staying pro-actively alert and by taking suo motu action of developments both in domestic and international markets. This, she said, will enable CCI to handle latent market challenges within India and from all other major economies of the world. She said that there is recoil of sorts in the world economies. 

In his address, Union Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur, said that CCI is a world class institution that has handled the challenges of the last decade and it has built strong foundations through a market-driven approach for the next decade. He said competition policy is the core of the market and CCI has carried out the role of enforcer and facilitator in a fine balance.

Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, lauded CCI for efficiently discharging responsibilities in regulatory, advisory and quasi-judicial capacities. He said the 10th anniversary of CCI is a watershed moment. He emphasised that to promote and sustain competition, it is the mandate of CCI to develop a competitive eco-system and also build strategy to meet emerging challenges. Shri Srinivas said the main challenge now before CCI is to withdraw excessive control but at the same time perform better as a caretaker of competition.

In his welcoming address, the CCI Chairperson, Shri Ashok Kumar Gupta welcomed the gathering and enumerated the various transitional achievements of the CCI in the first decade of its existence. Shri Gupta also expressed gratitude for contributions by those associated with the CCI in the formative years.

The Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister also released two in house publications, Diagnostic Toolkit for Procurement and Competition Law Judicial & Administrative Training Module. Both the publications are researched, prepared and published by the CCI.

CCI Members Shri Bhagwant Singh Bishnoi and Dr. Sangeeta Verma were also part of the 10th anniversary celebrations besides many other esteemed participants and audience.

                ShriInjetiSrinivas, Secretary (Corporate Affairs), today presented the Report of the Competition Law Review Committee to the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. NirmalaSitharaman.



The Committee consulted various stakeholders, including industry chambers, professional institutes, Government Departments/ Ministries, NGOs and experts. The Committee focused on furthering ease of doing business, encouraging start-ups and meeting the challenges of the new economy. The key recommendations of the Competition Law Review Committee are:


	Introduction of a ‘Green Channel’ for combination notifications to enable fast-paced regulatory approvals for vast majority of mergers and acquisitions that may have no major concerns regarding appreciable adverse effects on competition. The aim is to move towards disclosure based regime with strict consequences for not providing accurate or complete information. 
	Combinations arising out of the insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code will also be eligible for “Green Channel” approvals.
	Introducing a dedicated bench in NCLAT for hearing appeals under the Competition Act.
	Introduction of express provisions to identify ‘hub and spoke’ agreements as well as agreements that do not fit within typical horizontal or vertical anti-competitive structures to cover agreements related to business structures and models synonymous with new age markets. 
	Additional enforcement mechanism of ‘Settlement & Commitments” in the interests of speedier resolution of cases of anti-competitive conduct.
	Enabling provisions to prescribe necessary thresholds, inter alia, deal-value threshold for merger notifications.  
	CCI to issue guidelines on imposition of penalty to ensure more transparency and faster decision making which will encourage compliance by businesses.
	Strengthening the governance structure of CCI with the introduction of a Governing Board to oversee advocacy and quasi-legislative functions, leaving adjudicatory functions to the Whole-time Members.
	Merging DG’s Office with CCI as an ‘Investigation Division’ as it aids CCI in discharging an inquisitorial rather than adversarial mandate. However, functional autonomy must be protected. 
	Opening of CCI offices at regional level to carry out non-adjudicatory functions such as research, advocacy etc. and interaction with State Governments and State regulators. 


The Government constituted a Competition Law Review Committee on 1st October, 2018 to review the existing Competition law framework and make recommendations to further strengthen the framework to inter alia meet new economy challenges. The Committee was chaired by ShriInjetiSrinivas (Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs) and consisted of Members, namely, Shri Ashok Kumar Gupta (Chairperson, CCI), Dr. M.S. Sahoo (Chairperson, IBBI), ShriHaigreveKhaitan (M/s Khaitan& Co.), MsPallaviShardulShroff (M/S ShardulAmrchandMangaldas& Co.), Dr. Harshavardhana Singh (IKDHVAJ Advisors LLP), Dr. S. Chakravathy (Retd. IAS), Dr. Aditya Bhattacharya (Professor of Economics, Delhi School of Economics), ShriAnandPathak (PA Law Offices), Shri KVR Murty (Joint Secretary, MCA & Member Secretary).

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has found Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JAL) to be in contravention of the provisions of Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) for abuse of dominant position in the market of independent residential units such as villas, estate homes in their integrated township, by imposing unfair/ discriminatory conditions on the allottees in Wish Town, Jaypee Greens project, in Noida and Greater Noida.

The final order was passed on an information filed by a buyer who alleged that conditions imposed by JAL were arbitrary and heavily tilted in favour of it. 

Based on the investigation, the Commission found that the standard terms and conditions imposed by JAL were one-sided and couched in a manner so as to unilaterally favour itself and be unfavourable to the consumers. Moreover, terms were vague and did not confer any substantive rights on the buyers. The conduct of JAL, such as collecting money/charges from the buyers without delivering the residential/dwelling unit on time, adding additional construction and amending /altering the layout plans, imposition of various charges, right to raise finance from any bank/financial institution/body corporate without consulting buyers was held to be abusive.

Therefore, the Commission concluded such conduct of JAL to be in violation of Section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Act. Resultantly, the Commission imposed a penalty of Rs. 13.82 crore (Rupees Thirteen Crore Eighty Two Lakh) on JAL. The penalty was calculated @ 5% of the average revenue of JAL from sale of independent residential units in the relevant market. Besides, a cease and desist order has also been issued to JAL. 

A copy of the order passed in Case No. 99 of 2014 under Section 27 of the Act has been uploaded on the website of CCI at www.cci.gov.in.
