                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi facilitated the Indian contingent for the Commonwealth Games (CWG) 2022 in New Delhi. The facilitation was attended by both athletes and their coaches. Union Minister for Youth Affairs & Sports and Information & Broadcasting Shri Anurag Singh Thakur and Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Nisith Pramanik were among those present.

The Prime Minister congratulated the players and coaches for their stupendous performance at the Commonwealth Games 2022 held in Birmingham, where India bagged 22 Gold, 16 Silver and 23 Bronze medals in various disciplines. The Prime Minister welcomed the athletes and coaches and expressed immense pride in the accomplishments of India’s athletes at  CWG 2022. The PM said that it is a matter of pride that due to the splendid hard work of the sportspersons, the country is entering into the Azadi ka Amrit Kaal with an inspiring achievement.

The Prime Minister highlighted that in the last few weeks, the country has accomplished two major achievements in the field of sports. Along with the historic performance in the Commonwealth Games, the country has organized the Chess Olympiad for the first time. Addressing the athletes, the Prime Minister said “while all of you were competing in Birmingham, crores of Indians were keeping awake till late night here in India, watching your every action. Many people used to sleep with alarms set up so that they remained updated on the performances.” The Prime Minister said as per his promise at the time of the contingent’s send-off that we are celebrating victory today. 

Highlighting the great performance, the Prime Minister remarked that numbers do not reflect the entire story as many medals were missed by the narrowest possible margins which will soon be rectified by the determined players. He said that India has found a new way of winning in 4 new games as compared to last time. From lawn bowls to athletics, the athletes have performed phenomenally. With this performance, the trend of youth towards new sports in the country is going to increase a lot, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister also highlighted the achievements of the daughters of India in boxing, judo, wrestling and their domination in the CWG 2022. He said 31 medals came from the players who were making their debut indicating the growing confidence of the youth. 

The Prime Minister said that the athletes have strengthened the resolve of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshta Bharat’ not just by gifting a medal to the country, but also by giving the opportunity to celebrate and to be proud. The Prime Minister added the athletes inspire the youth of the country to do better not only in sports but also in other sectors. “You weave the country in unity of thought and goal that was also one the great strength of our freedom struggle”, he said. Mentioning the galaxy of freedom fighters, the Prime Minister said that despite the variance in methods, they all had the common goal of independence. Similarly, our players enter the arena for the prestige of the country. The Prime Minister mentioned that the power of the Tricolour was seen in Ukraine where it had become a protective shield not only for Indians but also for the citizens of other countries in getting out of the battlefield.

The Prime Minister expressed happiness upon the players who emerged out of the Khelo India stage and had done extremely well on the international stage. He also mentioned the positive effect of TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) which was now being seen. The Prime Minister highlighted the need to intensify our efforts to discover new talent and take them to the podium. “We have a responsibility to create a sports ecosystem that is globally excellent, inclusive, diverse and dynamic. No talent should be left behind”, he stressed. The Prime Minister also acknowledged the role of coaches, sports administrators and support staff in the success of the players. 

The Prime Minister urged the athletes to prepare well for the upcoming Asian Games and Olympics. On the occasion of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, the Prime Minister requested the athletes and their coaches to encourage children by visiting 75 schools, and educational institutions in the country, last year. The Prime Minister said that a lot of sportspersons had taken up this work and fulfilled it under the 'Meet the Champion' campaign. He also urged them to carry this campaign forward as the youth of the nation looks toward the athletes as role models. The Prime Minister said that “your growing recognition, capability and acceptance should be utilised for the younger generation of the country.” The Prime Minister concluded his address by congratulating the athletes on their ‘Vijay Yatra’ and wished them the very best for future endeavours. 

The facilitation by the Prime Minister is a part of his continuous endeavour to motivate athletes that represent India in major sporting events. Last year, the Prime Minister interacted with the Indian athletes’ contingent bound for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the Indian para-athletes’ contingent for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games. Even during the Commonwealth Games 2022, the Prime Minister took a keen interest in the athletes' progress and congratulated them on their success and sincere efforts, while motivating them to do better. 

The CWG 2022 was held in Birmingham from 28th July till 08th August 2022. A total of 215 athletes participated in 141 events across 19 sporting disciplines, where India bagged 22 Gold, 16 Silver and 23 Bronze medals in various disciplines.

Dr. Ambedkar was an outstanding leader of our freedom struggle and a staunch crusader for the rights of the downtrodden and traditionally disadvantaged sections of our society. A scholar, educationist, legal luminary, social reformer and political leader, Dr. Ambedkar’s philosophy and life are an inspirational profile of courage and conviction.

Dr. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the weaker sections, the historically deprived, peasants, labourers, and especially women, get equal rights and respect. He was an ardent advocate of resolving all issues through democratic, peaceful, non-violent and harmonious means.
The path shown by him strengthens the spirit of fraternity, compassion and equity.

On this day, let us take a pledge to learn from Dr. Ambedkar’s life and thoughts, and follow his teachings.”

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, released the India Rankings – 2019 and presented the India Rankings awards to the top eight institutions in different categories at a function held in New Delhi today (April 8, 2019). He also released the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA) and presented the ARIIA awards to the top two institutions. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that recent expansion of higher education in India has widened access and improved equity. Even so, quality remains a concern. While there are islands of excellence, both in the public and private sectors, overall standards are uneven. As our higher education infrastructure continues to grow, and as enrolment rises, it is important to lift the bar. A nuanced approach is essential to ensure that higher education not only fulfils individual aspirations, but also achieves national goals and priorities.

The President noted that besides overall rankings, category-specific rankings have been undertaken for colleges and universities, as well as subject-specific rankings for engineering, management, pharmacy, architecture, law and medicine. He said that a ranking system of such a nature fosters a spirit of healthy competition between institutions. This is vital because all institutions are today competing for talent – teaching talent, research talent, the most talented students, and even the most enlightened administrators. If an institution wants to attract the best, it too has to be among the best. It has to provide an encouraging atmosphere and suitable campus culture for students and members of the academic community.

The President said that it is critical that there be a significant Indian presence in global rankings of leading universities and higher educational institutions in the very near future. We live in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, amid a knowledge society and an innovation economy. We cannot realise our potential without the requisite education infrastructure – measured both by numbers and standards. That is why the keen sense with which institutions participate in the India Rankings mechanism should persist and be escalated to striving for and achieving rankings among the global best.

                The President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, reached Santiago, Chile in the evening of March 30, 2019 - the final leg of his visit to three nations – Croatia, Bolivia and Chile.

On March 31, 2019, the President visited the Pablo Neruda Museum in Santiago. He gifted a special pen to the Museum made by the family whom Gandhiji encouraged to develop the first indigenous fountain pen in India.

On the same evening, the President addressed a gathering of Indian community and friends of India at a reception hosted by Ms Anita Nayar, Ambassador of India to Chile. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in our quest for development and progress, the overseas Indian community is an invaluable partner.

Yesterday (April 1, 2019), the President commenced his engagements with paying his respects at the Monumento Al Libertador General Bernardo O’ Higgins. Thereafter, he visited the ‘La Moneda’ Presidential Palace where he was received by Mr Sebastian Pinera, the President of Chile and accorded a ceremonial welcome.

Subsequently, the President led the delegation-level talks between the two sides. Speaking on the occasion, hesaid that India and Chile trade relations are doing well. But the two countries can do much more. Chile is the fifth largest trading partner of India in the Latin American region. Copper constitutes more than 85% of the imports from Chile. We must diversify our trade basket to further strengthen trade.

In a major boost to furthering bilateral ties, Chile announced that it will allow visa-free entry to Indian nationals holding a valid US Visa. The President welcomed Chile’s decision as a step that would promote both cultural and business ties.

The President also thanked Chile for its strong condemnation of the recent Pulwama Terror. The two countries agreed to work together to strengthen global response to defeat and destroy terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and hold those responsible, accountable for their brutality against humanity.

India also offered training slots to Chilean armed forces in the premier defence institutions including for courses in mountain warfare and peacekeeping. The two countries also agreed to explore opportunities for other cooperation in the defense field including jointly manufacturing defense equipment under the Make in India program.

Following the delegation-level talks, the two Presidents witnessed the signing and exchange of three MoUs in the fields of mining, culture and disability. The President also issued a Press Statement on the occasion (attached).

In the subsequent engagement, the President addressed the India-Chile Business Roundtable in Santiago. Speaking on the occasion, he said that for India and for Indian business, Chile is not just a market; it is a very important and long-term partner country. Chile is India’s window to Latin America and to the Pacific Alliance. The President said that the two countries shall work together to expand their trade basket and open new pathways for economic engagement. We can cooperate in areas such as marine research and other scientific exploration, he said. India is also keen to strengthen its collaboration with Chile in the space sector.

The President said that in financial year 2017-18, India drew about US$ 62 billion in FDI and was recognised as among the world’s most attractive investment destinations. Given this, Chile’s modest investment in India is an anomaly. Since the beginning of the century, Chilean companies have invested just about US$ 150 million in India. This needs to be rectified.

He said that Chile’s two sovereign wealth funds have a reputation for sound investment decisions. They could consider opportunities in Indian infrastructure sector. Together we can design investment products that serve Chile’s Economic and Social Stabilisation Fund as well as its Pension Reserve Fund – and feed into the Indian growth story. This would lead to a win-win situation.

In his next engagement, the President attended a luncheon banquet hosted by President Pinera. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that our bilateral agenda is expansive. From energy to security, and from Yoga to Outer space, we have much work to do together. He wished that our warm and mutually beneficial friendship grow and prosper in tandem with the progress of both our peoples.

In the final engagement in Chile, the President addressed the students and faculty of the University of Chile on the topic ‘Gandhi for the Young’.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Mahatma Gandhi belonged to all cultures and he drew from all religions. While deeply rooted in Hinduism, Gandhiji was also influenced by Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism and Islam as also by thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau. He thus came to represent the confluence of all that was best in the East and the West.

The President said that Mahatma Gandhi carried his concept of universal love to include living in harmony with nature. He advocated both sustainability and ecological sensitivity at a time when the industrial revolution and increasing mechanization were the mantra guiding the world. He promoted concepts which are now enshrined in the sustainable development goals adopted by the United Nations.

The President said that Gandhi was a unique persona who inspired both the East and the West, who forged new pathways for human endeavour, while at the same time maintaining the strength and sanctity of tradition and spiritual roots. To all those who are adrift today in a sea of doubt and scepticism, his life, thought and philosophy would inspire them to regain inner strength and confidence. Mahatma Gandhi was more than just a man, he was an ideology, an institution that still resonates more than a hundred years after it was developed.

In the evening (April 1, 2019), the President left for Cape Town on his way back to India. He will take the opportunity provided by the transit halt to address the Indian Community in Cape Town.

                The Vice President expressed his concern over the increasing role of caste and money in public life and called upon media to shun giving prominence to coverage based on caste and community criteria, especially during elections. 

Delivering the First Dr Rajaram Jaipuria Memorial Lecture on Education, Entrepreneurship and Ethics at the Convention Center named after Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar in New Delhi today, the Vice President wanted the people to choose their public representatives on the basis of four C’s – Character, Caliber, Capacity an Conduct and said that unfortunately these four C’s were being subverted by some people by replacing them with four other C’s – Caste, Cash Criminality and Community. 

Shri Naidu wondered the purpose behind media focusing on caste data in every constituency and wanted the media to focus on the public representatives past performance in legislatures and parliament in terms of the number of questions asked, matters raised on public importance and their commitment towards peoples welfare rather than giving coverage to tactics like stalling the proceedings.

Shri Naidu expressed his displeasure over diminishing values in public life and referred to increasing trend of changing party loyalties by politicians. He said that changing parties has become a fashion and politicians were making a mockery of democracy.

Shri Naidu has urged educational institutions to focus on skill-literacy and said that India’s demographic advantage could turn into a demographic dividend only if there was focus on skill development and continuous upgradation of knowledge and skills. 

He said that it should be mandated for all private institutions to have dedicated skill development centers. He also wanted every technical institute to have an interface with the industry to give exposure to students about the requirements of employers.

Pointing out that India was a young nation, compared to China, USA, Europe and Japan, the Vice President said that by ensuring skill development and imparting latest training in various vocations to the youth, India would be able to cater to the global requirements of the skilled workforce apart from meeting the demand within the country. He called for equipping the younger generation with employable skills and training them to become job creators instead of job seekers.

The Vice President has also observed that the time has come for India to re-establish itself as a knowledge and innovation hub. He suggested a complete overhaul of higher education system to cater to the fast changing requirements of the 21st century in different sectors.

Expressing his concern over degeneration in ethical and moral outlook in different walks of life, the Vice President said education should lay a strong foundation towards building a society that upholds morals, ethics and values of humanism with an unwavering commitment.

He also called upon the industry bodies to have a code of conduct for their members in the wake of the recent happenings involving big businessmen.

Shri Naidu also recalled the Seven Sins mentioned by Mahatma Gandhi: ‘Wealth without work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, religion without sacrifice, and politics without principles’ and wanted everybody to understand them.

Observing that India was the fastest growing economy in the world and set to become the third largest economy in 10-15 years, the Vice President wanted all nations to have an arrangement for exchange of economic information, particularly from tax heavens. He also wanted United Nations to play a key role in ensuring the extradition of economic fugitives in the countries where they are wanted.

Referring to the rise in Non Communicable Diseases (NCD), Shri Naidu advised the youth to shun junk food and consume a healthy, time tested traditional food. He also wanted the youth to be physically fit.

Shri Shishir Jaipuria, the Chairman of Jaipuria Group of Educational Institutions, Shri S.K Mohapatra, the Director of Jaipuria Group of Educational Institutions and several prominent members of the business community and academia were present at the occasion.

 

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am extremely happy to be here today at this magnificent Convention Center named after Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar to deliver the First Dr Rajaram Jaipuria Memorial Lecture.

Let me begin with one of my favourite quotes of Babasaheb Ambedkar, the father of Indian Constitution: “An idea needs propagation as much as a plant needs watering. Otherwise, both will wither and die”.

I am therefore glad that the ideals and values which Dr Rajaram Jaipuria upheld all his life have been carefully nurtured by his successors, and we have assembled here today to celebrate his Idea of “Empowering the Next Generations through Quality Education”.

Thirukkural says “The wealth of learning is alone imperishable; nothing else is true wealth”.

Dr Rajaram Jaipuria was an industrialist and educationist at the same time. He selflessly followed a legacy of philanthropic-minded industrialists of the pre-Independence period, who used to set up educational institutions, temples and Rest Houses for pilgrims, driven by a spirit of social service, and not for business.

Following the footsteps of his late father Padma Bhushan Seth Mangturam Jaipuria, who had set up the famous Jaipuria College in Calcutta way back in 1945, Dr Rajaram Jaipuria established many educational institutions all over India, starting with the K-12 School in Kanpur in 1972 and also patronized the Char Dham Ved Nyas, imparting Vedic education in Sanskrit from ‘Prathama’ to ‘Acharya’ levels at five religious centres of India.

He combined the best of East and West, in terms of ‘values’ and ‘scientific advancements’ in the curriculum and pedagogy in all the academic institutions that he had established. I am very pleased to note that the Jaipuria Group logo carries one of my favourite quotes from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: ”Tamaso Ma Jyotir Gamaya” ie, “Lead us from darkness to light”.

The theme of today’s lecture has been aptly chosen by the Organizers--Education, Entrepreneurship & Ethics.

Today, we are living in the era of Industry 4.0. In this era, India has a real chance to progress faster and bridge the development gap with the most of the developed nations. We missed the first three Industrial Revolutions as we were too late to catch up with the West. 

But, thanks to the new digital age and the genius of young Indians, we stand a real chance to surge ahead and take the lead, given our demographic advantage. Industry 4.0 is also called the Knowledge Economy. The language of the new economy is digital and I am quite confident that our youth will take charge of New Digital India and take the country to new heights.

Apart from Bengaluru and Hyderabad, almost every city in India is evolving into a Silicon Valley. India is already home to one third of all start ups in the World, next only to China and the USA.

We are no longer strangers to words like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data, Cloud Computing, 3D Printing, Block chain, Machine Learning and Design Thinking. Most of the new startups are powered by these technologies. I am happy to note that you are already having the Atal Tinkering Labs in your schools.

Dear sisters and brothers, India is the fastest growing economy in the world today and we are on the path to becoming the third largest economy 10-15 years. Since 1991, at current prices in dollar terms, we are growing at over 8.7% CAGR and our per capita income is growing at 7% CAGR. Our literacy rate has improved from 52% in 1991 to 79% in 2018.  The prospects look quite bright.

India has a huge population of 1.35 billion with a per capita average annual income of $1928 and average life expectancy of 69 years, but the good news is 66% of our population will be in the age group of 15 to 64 by 2020 and the working population will remain at same level or higher until 2060. The average age of Indians in 2020 will be only 29 years as compared to China and USA at 37%, Europe at 44% and Japan at 50%. This means India will remain much younger compared to the population in already developed large economies like China, Europe and USA, for next four decades.

It is believed that there would be a shortage of skilled workers globally in a rapidly ageing world. By ensuring skill development and imparting latest training in various vocations to the youth, India can cater to the global requirements of skilled workforce, apart from meeting the demand within the country.

The demographic advantage is tilted towards India now. However, the demographic advantage can turn into a demographic dividend only if we focus on skill development and continuous upgradation of Knowledge and Skills. I am sure that the National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship will address all the challenges of skilling, while the National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) will help standardize and integrate the skill component of the people with the formal learning arrangement.

Students can learn from anywhere in real time now. Technology has effectively broken the barriers of distance through different mediums. We are now living in an Information and Communication Technology-driven world and imparting ICT- enabled education has become the sine qua non of the modern society. In fact, ICT revolution is triggering a paradigm shift in the education sector.

As you are aware, the platform of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) is revolutionizing learning and knowledge dissemination. India’s SWAYAM MOOCs platform has emerged as the World’s Largest Online Free E-Learning Platform Portal. It is designed to achieve access, equity and quality in education at all levels. Again under the SWAYAM PRABHA programme, high-quality educational programmes are being telecast through the DTH channels. Further the MHRD under its National Mission on Education through ICT (NME-ICT) has initiated the e-Pathshala. The interactive e-content covers around 70 subjects across all disciplines of social sciences, arts, fine arts, humanities, mathematics, linguistics and languages.

India faces a challenge regarding student enrolment and drop outs. Although, our Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) has improved to 25.8 per cent, it lags behind the global average of 33 percent and those of the emerging economies like Brazil (46 percent), Russia (78 percent) and China (36 percent). Mere literacy is not going to increase employability but skill-literacy shall. The Government initiatives on skill-literacy have to be supported by private institutions. I look forward to a strong participation by the Jaipuria Group in promoting skill-literacy in India.

Technology can bridge the GER gap. For example the Jaipuria Campuses can train many times its current 15000 strength by offering a helping hand to remote students in e-learning mode. A village school which has teachers and physical infrastructure up to primary level can offer education up to high school level in distant learning mode with virtual laboratories and conduct simulated experiments. Traditional craft schools up to high school level can be opened with resources naturally available in each village.

The syllabus and curriculum, and the pedagogy have to be revamped using design thinking and creativity. Rote learning has to be replaced by Action learning.

The use of ICTs has made lives of millions of Indian comfortable now in most areas of their engagement—be it agriculture, industry, business or service.

The time has now come for India to re-establish itself as a knowledge and innovation hub. For that to happen, we have to completely overhaul our higher education system to cater to the fast changing requirements of the 21st century in different sectors. Apart from remoulding the syllabi and pedagogy, the stress should be on learning-by-doing.  Greater focus should be on instilling entrepreneurial spirit among the students. This calls for exposure to industrial ecosystem and our educational institutions should develop organic linkages with local industries and ensure that students undergo internships in them as part of the course. We need more and more job creators and not job seekers and our education system should revamp its curricula in accordance with this requirement.

Already India has earned the distinction of being the second largest start-up hub in the world and we need to make India the numero uno in start-ups.

Another all-important aspect is the need for an education system that lays a strong foundation for progress of the society to be grounded in an   unwavering commitment to morals, ethics and values of humanism. Unfortunately, we are witnessing an all-round degeneration in ethical and moral outlook in different walks of life. Education will have to play a big role in arresting this undesirable trend. Let us recall the sagacious words of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, who had said: “Education which does not mould character is absolutely worthless”.

For ages, India was the Vishwa Guru. Our famous universities like Takhashila and Nalanda threw open their doors to students and scholars from other regions. In tune with our age-old ideal , “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”, we always believed in sharing knowledge with the global community. 

Education is the most vital engine of development and the best gift you can ever give to the children and youth for continuous progress of civilization and prosperity of humanity.

 

Sisters and brothers,

All of us owe a lot to our native place. Parents and teachers who shaped our careers. We as individuals must develop the habit of dedicating some time towards the welfare of the society.

Our ancient philosophy teaches us the value of caring and sharing. It is the collective responsibility of every citizen to do his bit to bring in a positive change in the lives of people. Every individual irrespective of position, post and political views must work for the welfare of others, empowering women and the weaker sections should be accorded highest priority. Memorial lectures provide an opportunity to recollect the service done by the great individuals and draw inspiration from their lives.

We should use these lectures as platform to motivate youth and guide them in the right direction. We must encourage the youth to adhere to traditions of tolerance and respect and protect the country's pluralistic culture. India of the future should be powered by the dreams, ambitions, character and competence of young people.

We need to cultivate a culture of healthy and civilized discussion on many of the pressing problems such as class and gender inequalities, illiteracy, poverty, climate change, and the needs of the less privileged in society.

Education which is the most important component in nation building must be given utmost priority. A rethink is needed on the education system to revamp syllabus to suit to the needs of 21st century knowledge economy.

Education must teach the children aspects such as service, and volunteerism. It must make students to be sensitive to the needs and sufferings of others.

We must inculcate a sense of oneness among the children by teaching them about the diverse and rich heritage and culture of our great nation. Inspiring Stories of freedom fighters, social reformers and biographies of eminent scientists must be made part of the curriculum so that the young get motivated by reading about the lives of great men.

 

Dear Students,

Before I conclude, I would like to say, with Indian economy on the rise, all of you will have plenty of avenues and opportunities and you should seize them. Remember the advice of former President A P J Abdul Kalam to dream high and work with dedication to realize your dreams and build a New India, which shall be free of poverty, illiteracy, fear, corruption, hunger and discrimination

Let me congratulate the Jaipuria Group of Educational Institutions for organizing this Memorial Lecture in the name and memory of a great Industrialist, Educationist, Entrepreneur, Philanthropist and above all a great human being. 

I am happy to join you all today to celebrate the gift of Dr Rajaram Jaipuria to posterity.

 

Jai Hind!

                The Rajya Sabha Day celebrations were organized on 29 April 2019 in GMC Balayogi Auditorium, Parliament Library Building, New Delhi to mark the Rajya Sabha Day which is observed on 3rd April every year in the Rajya Sabha Secretariat. It may be recalled that the Rajya Sabha was constituted for the first time on 3rd April 1952. Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, Hon'ble Vice-President of India and Chairman, Rajya Sabha graced the occasion.

Referring to the eventful journey of the Rajya Sabha since its inception in 1952, the Vice President said, ""Over the years, Rajya Sabha has emerged as a vibrant second Chamber of our Parliament, contributing to our tasks of nation building. Through the performance of its varied roles, the Rajya Sabha has lived up to the expectations of the Founding Fathers of our Constitution"".  

Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said that a Legislative Secretariat and a Legislature are complimentary to each other in sustaining the smooth and effective functioning of parliamentary democracy and as such while the Secretariat remains ever agile and active in providing requisite secretarial support to the House and the Members for enhancing legislative output, increasing disruption of the proceedings of our legislatures has impacted the legislative productivity and efficiency. My heart bleeds when the House does not function due to disruptions.

He referred to the valedictory remarks made by him at the conclusion of the last budget session when he had said that 'people of the country want our House to be a performing House. The Members can alone make the august House a performing one or a dysfunctional one. The choice is of the Members. We should all keep in mind the expectations of the people and try to live up to their expectations'.

Appreciating the recent efforts in the Secretariat in terms of office automation and technological upgradation, he said that the Rajya Sabha Secretariat was keeping pace with the latest technology and for this, a number of steps are being taken to modernise the Secretariat in terms of ease and smoothness of work and the priority is being accorded to technology driven attendance system, work flow and e-office.

Reflecting on the multi ethnic and multi lingual character of the Parliament, the Vice President said that the path breaking efforts in the Rajya Sabha have been made such as making the interpretation facility available to the Members to speak in the House in all the 22 languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. He added that a Committee has been constituted to examine the existing rules and procedure to ensure smooth functioning of the House.

Shri Naidu applauded the Rajya Sabha Television (RSTV) for making rapid strides in terms of the appeal for its content and viewership since August 2017 when he took over as Chairman, Rajya Sabha.  He said that in August, 2017, the YouTube subscriber base of RSTV was around 4 lakhs. It crossed one million mark in June last year and crossed the two million mark in February this year. The YouTube subscriber base of RSTV is now over 2.5 million and is far ahead other major channels. As such, YouTube subscriber base has increased by over 500% since August, 2017 which is a creditable achievement.

The Vice President appreciated the employees of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat for rendering non-partisan and objective secretarial assistance to the Presiding Officers, the Members, the House and the Parliamentary Committees which could sustain the progressive change in Parliament’s work profile, thus contributing to our democratic nation building.

The Welcome Address was delivered by Shri Desh Deepak Verma, Secretary-General, Rajya Sabha and the vote of thanks was given by Shri Mukul Pande, Additional Secretary, Rajya Sabha on this occasion. A cultural programme on the theme 'Indradhanush' a combination of different Indian classical dance forms by the artists from Kathak Dharohar, a renowned performing art institute was also organized.

 

The following is the full text of the speech:

राज्य सभा दिवस मनाने के लिए आयोजित इस समारोह में आप सबके साथ सम्मिलित होने पर मुझे प्रसन्नता है। इस सुखद अवसर पर आप सभी बड़ी संख्या में उपस्थित हैं, आप सभी को मेरी शुभकामनाऐं और अभिनंदन।

2. राज्य सभा दिवस, 1952 में हुई इस महान संस्था की स्थापना से लेकर आज की इसकी घटनापूर्ण यात्रा, का स्मरण कराता है। इन वर्षों में राज्य सभा हमारी संसद का जीवंत, सजग प्रहरी सदन बन कर उभरी है। राष्ट्र निर्माण में इसकी भूमिका अभिनंदनीय रही है। अपनी विभिन्न भूमिकाओं में, राज्य सभा देश के संविधान निर्माताओं की अपेक्षाओं पर खरी उतरी है।

3. व्यक्तिगत रूप से मेरे लिए राज्य सभा सदैव प्रिय रही है। अपनी विभिन्न भूमिकाओं में इस सदन से मेरा लंबा नाता रहा है - पहले इस सदन के सदस्य के रूप में, कभी संसदीय समिति के अध्यक्ष के रूप में, कभी संसदीय कार्य मंत्री के तौर पर और अब इस सदन के सभापति के रूप में इस सदन से जुड़ा रहा हूं।


	As you all know, as the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, I have to discharge some constitutional and statutory responsibilities. In my tenure so far, I did take some important decisions, in relatively quick time, which were well received. This could be possible due to the expert advice tendered to me by the Rajya Sabha Secretariat. I wish to place on record my deep appreciation for the high level of professionalism, efficiency and commitment of the officers and staff of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat.
	Rajya Sabha Secretariat has a constitutional status.  The persons of calibre and expertise with appropriate educational qualifications are recruited to carry out the specialized nature of parliamentary work. They possess exceptional attributes, which make the Secretariat truly unique. Reflecting on the attributes of the parliamentary staff vis-à-vis the executive secretariat, R.K. Sidhva, a learned Member of the Constituent Assembly, while participating in the Debate relating to article 98 of the Constitution suggested and I quote: 


I wish to make it clear that the staff of the Legislature Secretariat should be quite different from the staff of executive. The staff of the legislature should be chosen from persons who are amiable, social, kind, useful and helpful to the Members, and not that kind of staff which exists in the Executive Secretariat.


	राज्य सभा सचिवालय के अधिकारी, पीठासीन अधिकारियों, संसद सदस्यों, सदन और उसकी समितियों को दलीय राजनीति से दूर रह कर, वस्तुनिष्ठ, तथ्यात्मक सलाह देते रहे हैं। साथ ही आपने संसद की कार्यप्रणाली, उसके संगठन, बढ़ती हुई जन अपेक्षाओं में हो रहे निरंतर बदलावों के अनुसार भी स्वयं को ढ़ाला है और हमारी लोकतांत्रिक प्रक्रिया को सहयोग दिया है। देश निर्माण में आपका योगदान सराहनीय है।
	In recognition of this specialized roles and responsibilities, we have the system of separate Parliamentary Pay Committee to address the issues of salary, allowances and other amenities of the employees of the Secretariat. I am happy that the recommendations of the Parliamentary Pay Committee following the 7th Central Pay Commission, have been implemented. The hike in the allowances was an acknowledgement of your hard-work and commitment.  I wish that our Secretariat turns out to be one of the best performing legislature secretariats in the world.
	आज के विश्व में स्मार्ट टेक्नोलाजी ही सफलता और सक्षमता की कुंजी है। देश की सर्वोच्च प्रतिनिधि संस्था का सचिवालय होने के कारण आपसे अपेक्षित है कि आप टेक्नोलाजी में हो रहे बदलावों को समय के साथ आत्मसात करेंगे। आफिस आटोमेशन तथा तकनीकी बदलाव करेंगे। मुझे यह जानकर हर्ष है कि सचिवालय के अधिकारी तकनीकी उन्नयन और कौशल प्रशिक्षण के प्रति तत्पर रहे हैं। सचिवालय के कामों में सुगमता और सरलता लाने के लिए कई कदम उठाये जा रह हैं - तकनीक आधारित अटैंडेंस/उपस्थिति पद्धति, ई-आफिस, वर्क फ्लो जैसी प्रणालियों को प्राथमिकता दी जा रही है। सचिवालय के भविष्य के लिए यह शुभ संकेत है।
	In the contemporary world, the buzz word is smart technology. Being the Secretariat of the apex legislative body, it is imperative for us to keep pace with the latest in terms of office automation and technological upgradation. I am happy to note that the officials of the Secretariat are ever open and adaptable to innovations and skill updation. Consciously, a number of steps are being taken to modernise  this Secretariat  in terms of ease and smoothness of work. Priority is being accorded to technology driven attendance system, work flow and e-office. All these augur well for the future of our Secretariat.
	A Legislature secretariat and a Legislature are complimentary to each other in sustaining the smooth and effective functioning of parliamentary democracy. While the Secretariat remains ever agile and active in providing requisite secretarial support to the House and the Members for enhancing legislative output, increasing disruption of the proceedings of our legislatures has   impacted the legislative productivity and efficiency.  As the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, I have been making sincere efforts to ensure smooth conduct of the business of the House.  Parliament's role as a catalyst for socio-economic transformation is well acknowledged. As a House of Elders, we are usually expected to show the way to others. There is an onerous and pious responsibility cast on the shoulders of all the Members of Rajya Sabha to become agents of change.
	In my valedictory remarks at the conclusion of the last budget session, I had remarked that   'people of the country want our House to be a performing House. The Members can alone make the august House a performing one or a dysfunctional one. The choice is of the Members. We should all keep in mind the expectations of the people and try to live up to their expectations...'. We should be able to avert the public perception about the state of affairs in the House.
	हम आजकल देश में लोकतंत्र का महापर्व मना रहे हैं। कुछ ही दिनों में सत्रहवीं लोक सभा का गठन भी होगा। मुझे विश्वास है कि नयी लोक सभा के गठन के साथ ही दोनों सदनों की कार्यप्रणाली में एक नये अध्याय का सूत्रपात होगा। मैं आशा करता हूं कि अर्थपूर्ण सहयोग, संवाद, विमर्श और विधायी कार्यों के एक नये अध्याय का प्रारंभ होगा।
	मुझे हर्ष है कि इस शुभ अवसर पर एक भव्य सांस्कृतिक आयोजन रखा गया है। मुझे विश्वास है कि ‘कथक धरोहर’ के प्रतिभावान कलाकार अपने शास्त्रीय नृत्य से हम सभी का मन मोह लेंगे।इस अवसर पर मैं, राज्य सभा दिवस पर आयोजित विभिन्न प्रतियोगिताओं में पुरस्कार जीतने वाले राज्य सभा कर्मियों के बच्चों को उनकी उपलब्धि पर बधाई और शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। और उन सभी को जिन्होंने इन प्रतियोगिताओं में भाग लिया उन्हें भी शुभकामनाऐं देता हूं।
	मुझे हर्ष है कि हमारे बीच इस अवसर पर राज्य सभा सचिवालय के अवकाश प्राप्त सदस्य भी उपस्थित हैं। आप सचिवालय के वृहत्तर परिवार के सम्मानीय सदस्य हैं और सदैव रहेंगे।
	राज्य सभा के इस विशाल परिवार के अभिभावक के रूप में, मैं आप सभी को स्वास्थ्य, सुख और संतोष की शुभकामनाऐं देता हूं।
	To ensure the smooth functioning of the House, I had constituted a two-member Committee to examine the existing rules and procedures. I have already received the Report, which will be further considered. To facilitate the Members to speak in their mother tongue, if they so wish,  for their effective participation in the proceedings, we  have also put in place interpretation facility in all 22 languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. 
	We are in the midst of the great festival of democracy.   Shortly, the Seventeenth Lok Sabha will be constituted. I sincerely hope that the constitution of the new Lok Sabha enables our country to move faster towards realizing it’s potential.
	I am happy that an impressive cultural show is being presented befitting the occasion. I am sure, the versatile artists from Kathak Dharohar will entertain all of us with their classical dance performances. I am very happy that employees of the Secretariat are also putting up a cultural programme. I take this opportunity to congratulate the children of our employees for winning prizes in various competitions held to mark the Rajya Sabha day celebrations. I also appreciate all those who participated in these competitions. 
	I am happy to see some of the retired employees of the Secretariat present here. You all have been a part of the extended family of the Secretariat and continue to be so in future.
	As the head of this large family of the Rajya Sabha, I wish each and every one of you the very best of health and happiness. 


Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu called for a re- look into the way students are trained in colleges and schools and said that there is need to move away from textbook knowledge, rigid ideas and examination marks and to focus on well informed, open debates. 

Addressing the 55th Annual Prize Distribution Ceremony of Shyam Lal College in New Delhi today, the Vice President asked centres of higher education to replace long hours of lecturing with newer teaching methods using case studies, problem solving and role playing, to improve employability.

Saying that acquisition of employable skills and knowledge were tools to succeed in modern day careers, Shri Naidu urged Institutions of higher education to develop an industry focus and encourage students to take up live projects, internships and enable them to constantly interact with industry and corporate bodies.

Expressing concern over the poor global ranking of Indian institutions, the Vice President said that our quest for excellence in education would remain unfulfilled if we fail to achieve international standards in higher education.

Asking higher educational institutions such as Shyam Lal College to strive for excellence, Shri Naidu opined that excellence was always the result of unwavering dedication, intelligent planning, and relentless determination and focused effort.

Talking about India’s incredible demographic dividend, Shri Naidu stressed upon the need to educate the burgeoning youth population and equip them with employable skills to harness the immense youth power to make India a global leader.

Opining that neglecting education would adversely impact growth of the nation as a whole, the Vice President said that there was an urgent and imminent need to re-think and re-engineer the entire education system.

Shri Naidu stressed upon the need to fundamentally re-cast the education system, institutions, pedagogy, teaching and learning methods and said that a beginning must be made from primary education. He opined that ensuring access, diversity, equity and quality in primary education was an essential component in all such efforts.

Shri Naidu also suggested increasing investment in education from the current 3% of GDP to at least 6% by 2022, as recommended by NITI Aayog. He wanted institutions especially schools in rural areas, to ensure not only 100% enrolment but also make sure that all children learn at a high level of proficiency and make sure that no child was left behind.

In order to improve the state of primary education, the Vice President suggested a renewed focus on childhood nutrition. He said we must not let education be held hostage in the vicious cycle of poverty and malnutrition He also wanted special attention towards children belonging to vulnerable sections such as the differently abled.

Pointing out that Vedic Age presented equality of opportunity and freedom of thought and expression to both men and women, Shri Naidu opined that educating the girl child was the most essential component of women empowerment. He added that programs for educating girl children should become people’s movements if their objectives are to be achieved. 

The Vice President distributed prizes to meritorious students and lauded the efforts of the institution in providing education to poor and marginalized sections of society at the heart of the national capital.

Prof. Yogesh Tyagi, the Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi, Smt. Savita Gupta, Chairperson Governing Body, Prof. Rabi Narayan Kar, Principal, Shyam Lal College, faculty and students of Shyam Lal College were present at the venue.

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am delighted to be here today among so many bright and talented youngsters for the Annual Prize Distribution Ceremony of Shyam Lal College. 

Shyam Lal College, a constituent college of the University of Delhi, was established in 1964 by the great visionary and entrepreneur Padmashree (late) Shri Shyam Lal Gupta, the then Chairman of Shyam Lal charitable trust. I am told that the foundation stone of the College was laid down by none other than Dr. Zakir Hussain, the former Vice President of India.

I am delighted to know that SLC has celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2014. 

I am also pleased to know that this College has become a center of academic excellence and is counted among the best institutions in the University of Delhi. 

I am also happy to know that SLC has, since its inception attempted to make quality education accessible to students, especially girls, from economically and educationally disadvantaged communities of East Delhi. 

What is particularly noteworthy is that SLC is fully powered by renewable energy and has taken up several green initiatives and recycling efforts.

I understand that SLC, in a visionary move to maximize teaching-learning outcomes, has established six important centers for Industry Interaction, skill development, women empowerment, Gandhi studies etc for the all round development of its students. 

My dear young friends,

The Annual Day function of an institution is a culmination of all the activities for the year and a celebration of the achievements of its students and teachers.

Let me take this opportunity to congratulate all those who have been awarded medals and prizes here today. These honors are a recognition of your hard work, your talent and your commitment to excellence. 

Excellence is never an accident or a happy coincidence. It is always the result of unwavering dedication, intelligent planning, relentless determination and focused effort.

Excellence is not a destination. It is a continuing process of setting higher goals and preparing yourself to achieve them. It is a consistent process of self improvement, the unlimited capability to adapt and reform. 

I hope that these accolades that you receive today will set the stage for an illustrious life filled with many such achievements and triumphs.

My dear young friends,

India has a rich and glorious history of pursuit of excellence in education. 

It has been estimated that the history of education in India is nearly 5000 years old.

Ancient scriptures known as Vedas formed the strong foundations of Indian civilization.

The Vedic Age presented equality of opportunity and freedom of thought and expression to both men and women. Personality development and learning through practical experiments and activities was given utmost importance.

Education during the Vedic age was a journey from darkness to light, from mortality to immortality, from chaos to order and from misery to spiritual bliss.

The Middle Ages in Indian history was a rather dynamic time for education. It was during this period that the famed citadels of learning, the Nalanda and the Vikramshila Universities thrived, attracting seekers of knowledge from far and wide.  

Since independence, India has made many gains in the field of education. India's higher education system is the world's third largest in terms of students, next to China and the United States. India is all set to be one of the largest education hubs of the world.

India is also one of the youngest nations in the world with nearly 242 million 10-24 year olds. 65% of our population is below 35 years of age.  This is an incredible demographic dividend waiting to be exploited. We will be successful in harnessing this immense youth power only if we educate, skill and gainfully and meaningfully employ this burgeoning youth population.

Unfortunately, our education system is fraught with a number of challenges. We have to address these challenges systemically and systematically.

If we neglect education, we neglect growth of the nation as a whole. 

Investing in education is investing in the future of the vibrant nation, which is why the Kothari Commission had said that “the destiny of our country is being shaped in our classrooms”.

We have to begin by increasing this investment from the current 3% of GDP to atleast 6% by 2022, as opined by NITI Aayog in its report published in December last year.

I believe that there is also an imminent need to re-think and re-engineer our entire education system.

We need to fundamentally re-cast our education system, our institutions, our pedagogy, our teaching and our learning methods and we must start from the very roots, from primary education.

It is an imperative to consistently ensure not only 100% enrolment but also make sure that all children learn at a high level of proficiency. 

No child must be left behind. 

We must ensure access, diversity, equity and quality in primary education.  

Improving the state of primary education would also require a renewed focus on childhood nutrition. 

We must not let education be held hostage in the vicious cycle of poverty and malnutrition. 

Special attention must be given to children belonging to vulnerable sections such as the differently abled.

Gender equality must be one of the strong pillars upon which we rebuild our education system.

Swami Vivekananda once remarked that ‘The present system of education is all wrong. The mind is crammed with facts before it knows how to think’.

Textbook knowledge, rigid ideas, and examination marks should not take precedence over informed, open debates 

India now faces equity, quality and employability issues. 

Employability is not just the ability to get a job, but the acquisition of skills, knowledge and tools to succeed in careers. 

Employability is possessing creativity, problem-solving skills and an ability to work in a highly inter-connected, interdependent global work environment. 

Our centres of higher education must move away from long hours of lecturing and take up newer teaching methods using case studies, problem solving and role playing to improve employability.

Institutions of higher education must have an industry focus and encourage students to take up live projects, internships and enable them to constantly interact with the industry and corporate bodies. 

My dear young friends, 

Education consists of three important pillars: Knowledge, skills and attitudes.

All three are equally important. 

Practical application based education is the need of the hour.

There has to be more emphasis on theoretical knowledge till now. This must change. 

Our graduates are good at routine, transactional work but often fail when it comes to researching and innovating. 

We need to emphasize creativity and critical thinking to produce graduates who can confidently navigate the uncertain world of work and learning in the 21st century.

Skill development should also be an integral part of education. Apart from imparting skills which aid in the performance of jobs, we must also nurture skills such as conflict resolution and team building, along with soft skills such as language proficiency and communication.

Another important skill we need to impart in our youngsters is that of calculated risk taking. We are doing our best to promote entrepreneurship and the ability to take risks in a country that is culturally risk averse. This is the key to entrepreneurial success.

Flexibility, adaptability and the ability to learn, unlearn and relearn at a fast pace are also crucial to flourish in a technology driven world of automation, where  new jobs emerge as old jobs become extinct at a rapid pace.

Education is also a process through which we reform and refine our mindsets and attitudes

I sincerely believe that perseverance and empathy are crucial qualities that we must nurture in young people. In a world that is ridden with violence, discrimination and injustice, it is important that our children grow up with love and compassion for their fellow human beings. Education which does not build character was among the seven deadly social sins enunciated by Gandhi ji.

The education we provide our children must enable, empower and enlighten them to rise above the narrow walls of community, caste, race and gender that divide us and persevere to create a unified, peaceful and progressive world.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Even as we aspire to be a world leader, we must also anchor ourselves firmly in the moral values and ethical principles which bring peace and contentment in life. 

Let me conclude with a thought that Mahatma Gandhi once enunciated. He said, ‘Literacy in itself is no education. Literacy is not the end of education or even the beginning. By education I mean an all-round drawing out of the best in the child and man-body, mind and spirit.""

I hope that this temple of learning imparts education that brings out the best in every learner.

Thank You!

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President, Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu said today that the empowerment of differently abled persons should start with the complete and total annihilation of discriminatory tendencies against them. 

He was addressing the gathering at “Miracle on Wheels”, a cultural performance presented by differently abled persons, organized by the PushpviharAyyappaSewaSamithi in New Delhi today.

The Vice President expressed his deep appreciation for the “Miracle on wheels” performers and said that the wonderful and multitalented group of individuals has been showing the world that no disability can tie them down and conquer their spirits. 

 

He applauded the community welfare initiatives and social service activities undertaken by the PushpviharAyyappaSevaSamithiand said that the idea of community welfare formed the core of India’s social ethos.‘“Sarvejanahsukhinobhavantu” has been the underlying theme of Indian philosophical thought. Caring and sharing has been at the centre of our cultural tradition’, he added.

Speaking of the several initiatives undertaken by the union and various State Governments for the welfare of differently-abled people, the Vice President asserted that it should be the collective responsibility of the government and the society to support Divyangjan and empower them to lead a dignified life.

Shri. Naidu emphasized that differently-abled people need is empathy, encouragement, facilitation and empowerment.He stated that Eliminating discriminatory tendencies against Divyaangjanshould be the first step in empowering them. ‘As a society, we need to ensure that no stigma is attached to disability and learn to recognize the valuable human assets we have in people with special needs’, he added. 

The Vice President said that India is a cultural treasure house we can all be proud of.  He made an earnest appeal to one and all to preserve and augment India’s cultural heritage and to promote the message of peace, compassion and inclusion that is at the heart of our cultural and religious tradition. 

He expressed hope that organisations like the PushpviharAyyappaSewaSamithiwould continue to improve the quality of human lives through events like this that showcase the divine spark in every human being. 

Justice (Retd.) K Ramamoorthy, Chairman-Advisory Board, PushpviharAyyappaSewaSamithi, Justice Rajiv Shakhdher, Justice, High Court of Delhi, Shri. Vijay Kumar Dev, Chief Secretary, Government of Delhi, Shri. Mohan Parasaran, Senior Advocate and Chairman, Co-ordination Committee, PushpviharAyyappaSewa Samiti and others were present at the occasion.

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am extremely happy to be present here for this unique function “Miracle on Wheels”, which is being organized to enable the completion of construction of PushpviharSreeDharmasaastha Temple established by PushpviharAyyappaSewaSamithi.

At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation for the “Miracle on wheels” performers for demonstrating that a strong will has the power to overcome all limitations.

I am told that it is a group of differently abled individuals primarily living on wheel chairs who are going to perform today. Through their performances, this wonderful and highly talented group of individuals has been showing that no limitation can prevent anybody from realizing his or her dreams if the goal is pursued with sincerity and passion. 

I am glad that the board members of the PushpviharAyyappaSevaSamithi are serving the society without making any distinction of race, gender, caste, religion or social status. 

Community welfare is at the very heart of India’s social ethos. 

“Sarvejanahsukhinobhavantu” has been the underlying theme in all our thoughts and actions. Caring and sharing has been at the centre of our cultural tradition.

As you all are aware, several initiatives have been taken by the union government and various State Governments for the welfare of the differently-abled people and to enable them lead a life of dignity. Although, many civil society organizations are partnering with the government, much more needs to be done. What the differently-abled people need is empathy, encouragement, facilitation and empowerment.

Eliminating discriminatory tendencies should be the first step in empowering differently-abled people. It should be the collective responsibility of the government and the society to support Divyangjan and empower them to lead a dignified life.

As a society, we need to ensure that no stigma is attached to disability and learn to recognize the valuable human assets we have in people with special needs. 

I would like to congratulate the Samithi for including a visually challenged singer, KayamkulamBabu, the devotional singer Shri Anoop Ashokan and Ms Sitara in today’s program. 

This programme really shows the will of differently abled Indians to build a strong and futuristic India where every citizen can live with dignity and lead a life of fulfilment. 

I am also happy to note that the Samithi, a religious organization is also engaged in organizing social and cultural events. I am happy to note that the Samithi’s main objective is to render free service to economically weaker sections. This is in keeping with the Indian vision of service to humanity as service to divinity.It is also the vision of saints like Narsi Mehta who sang the famous song –“Vasihnava Jana To TeneKahiye”.

India is a cultural treasure house we can all be proud of. Let us preserve this and promote the message of peace, goodness, compassion and inclusion that is at the heart of Indian religious tradition. 

I do hope that religious organisation like the PushpviharAyyappaSewaSamithi will continue to improve the quality of human lives through events like this that showcase the divine spark in everyone of us. 

I wish the Samithi a glorious future.

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu said today that the youth of our nation must shoulder the greater social responsibility of exercising judgement in looking at social issues. He urged them to adhere to the traditions of tolerance and respect and protect our pluralistic culture.

He was addressing the 68th convocation of Panjab University of which he is the Chancellor, in Chandigarhtoday. Shri. Naidu said that Panjab University had a glorious past and is one of the oldest universities in India, set in a land which has witnessed centuries of civilisation & dedication to spreading knowledge in ancient centres of learning like Takshila.

He expressed his happiness at the University’s relentless quest for academic excellence and the rapid progress it has made in providing quality education to its 15000 students enrolled in about 200 affiliated colleges, 3 regional centers, 6 constituent colleges and one rural center.  

The Vice President congratulated Panjab University for having secured the 34th position among all academic institutions in the nation, in the recent rankings under the National Institutional Ranking Framework. He also applauded the University’s focused efforts towards cultivating innovation and entrepreneurship among students. ‘I am very happy that the University has been recognized by the UGC as the “University with potential for excellence in Biomedical Sciences” with facilities for stem cell Research and Drug development’, he added. 

The Vice President opined that Institution building is not an easy task and added that it requires vision, passion, competence, commitment, dedicated hard work and the ability to tap into the infinite potential within individuals and a network of institutions. He urged all stake holders of the Panjab University to keep up the momentum of their good work and not let complacency set in. 

Shri. Naidu affirmed that India of the future would be powered by the dreams and ambitions, the character and competence of young people. He stated that we will be able to fully realize the vast demographic dividend in the years to come only if we can empower our youth with the right skills and attitudes.

The Vice President proposed that we must rethink and re-orient our educational system in the context of the twenty first century when the concerns of ecology, of human welfare and the welfare of the planet are equally imperative. ‘It is possible only if we turn our system around, including aspects of curriculum and evaluation, towards critical thinking’, he said.

Observing that access to higher education has been improved considerably in our country, Shri. Naidu said that we have to focus upon raising the quality of education and ensuring that we offer the best possible education to our young people.

The Vice President suggested that we have to have institutions which are continuously nourished by five important streams of “inquisitiveness”, “innovation”, ethos that inspire “inspiration”, “integration” which encourages inter-disciplinary and collaborative learning and an “internalized value system”, just like Panjab which is irrigated by 5 rivers

Shri Naidu also urged the youth of the nation to use the means of communication that technology has provided, responsibly. He emphasized that these modern means of communication must be used to facilitate social harmony and to cultivate a culture of healthy and civilized discussion on many of the pressing problems such as class and gender inequalities and the needs of the less privileged in society. ‘We need to address these problems with empathy and sincerity’, he added. 

The Vice President also extended felicitations to Dr. K. Sivan, the Chairman of ISRO and one of our country’s foremost space scientists who was being honored by Panjab University with the Vigyan Ratna Award.  ‘Dr. Sivan’s outstanding work is an eloquent testimony of India’s extraordinary capability in space science and technology’, he said. 

Shri V.P. Singh Badnore, Hon’ble Governor of Punjab, Prof. Raj Kumar, Vice Chancellor, Panjab University, Prof. Shankarji Jha, Dean of University Instruction, Prof. Karamjeet Singh, Registrar, Panjab University and others were also present at the occasion.

 

The following is the full text of the speech:

 

इस प्रसिद्ध विश्वविद्यालय के 68वें दीक्षांत समारोह के अवसर पर आप सभी महानुभावों के बीच आकर प्रसन्नता का अनुभव कर रहा हूं। अविभाजित भारत के लाहौर शहरमें, सन् 1882 में स्थापित इस विश्वविद्यालय की समृद्ध शैक्षणिक और वैचारिक परंपरा रही है। विभाजन के बाद 1956 में यह विश्वविद्यालय चंडीगढ़ में स्थानान्तरित करदिया गया। आधुनिकभारत के सबसे पुराने विश्वविद्यालयों में से एक, यह विश्वविद्यालय उस क्षेत्र में स्थित है जिसने शताब्दियों तक मानव सभ्यता को विकसित होते देखा है। जहां के तक्षशिला जैसे प्राचीन शिक्षण संस्थानों ने सदियों तक पीढ़ियों को ज्ञान के प्रकाश से प्रकाशित किया है। इस विश्वविद्यालय की ख्याति को रूचिरामसाहनीऔरशांतिस्वरूपभटनागर जैसे प्रतिष्ठित शिक्षाविदों ने संवारा है। इस विश्वविद्यालय ने हमारे राष्ट्रीय जीवन में महत्वपूर्ण योगदान दिया है। हमारे पूर्व राष्ट्रपति डॉ. शंकर दयाल शर्मा, पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री डॉ. मनमोहन सिंह तथा स्व. श्रीइंद्रकुमार गुजराल साहब, वरिष्ठ मंत्री श्रीमतीसुषमा स्वराज जी, वरिष्ठ प्रशासक श्रीएन.एन. वोहरा तथा श्रीमतीकिरण बेदी, नोबल पुरस्कार से सम्मानित प्रोफेसर हरगोविंद खुराना, प्रो. यशपाल, अंतरिक्ष यात्री कल्पना चावला, डॉ. दीपक पेंटल, न्यायमूर्ति हंसराज खन्ना तथा न्यायविद सत्यपाल जैन जैसी अनेक प्रतिष्ठित हस्तियों ने यहां से शिक्षा ग्रहण कर, समाज और राष्ट्रीय जीवन में योगदान दिया है।

Dear students and faculty members,

You are all heirs to this rich intellectual tradition established over a period of more than 100 years.  I am happy to note that the university continues to sustain this quest for academic excellence and is taking rapid strides in providing quality education to its 15000 students enrolled in about 200 affiliated colleges, 3 regional centres, 6 constituent colleges and one rural centre.  

The recent rankings under the National Institutional Ranking Framework have put Panjab University at the 34th rank among all the academic institutions in the country.  I am happy to note that it is ranked 21 in the top 100 universities in India.  It is also very heartening that it figures at rank No. 2 in the top 75 institutions as far as pharmacy is concerned.  I am told that it has been placed at the 9th rank in the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation achievements 2019.  I compliment the VC, faculty and the entire staff of Panjab University for these commendable achievements. 

Dear Students and faculty members,

This is an institution with a glorious past and has emerged as an institution of great repute.  All of you are continuously shaping this institution through your thoughts and actions.  

Institution building is not an easy task. It requires vision, passion, competence and commitment. It requires dedicated hard work and the ability to tap into the infinite potential within individuals and a network of institutions. 

It is not a static unmoving phenomenon. 

Institutions are built when there is a shared vision among all the stakeholders especially all the teaching faculty, the research community and the other supporting staff. In short, all of you are partners in the progress of this institution. I am sure each one of you will keep up this momentum and not let complacency set in. Nor should you do anything that will sully the image of this institution. 

Dear students and faculty members,

Today’s convocation is a milestone, a culmination of all your efforts and a celebration of your achievements. For the students, this is a moment of fulfillment as well as a moment of excited anticipation of the future.  

For the teachers, it is a moment of reflection, a moment to recount the memorable moments of interaction with young minds, of imparting knowledge skills and attitudes. 

For the parents of the students, it is also a moment of deep satisfaction for the parents to see their children graduate and successfully complete a major phase of their educational journey.

Today is also a special moment when you are honouring Dr. K. Sivan, Chairman ISRO one of our country’s foremost space scientists.   

It is a special celebration because it points to the new limitless opportunities that await all the young people today.  Dr. Sivan’s outstanding work is an eloquent testimony of India’s extraordinary capability. His achievements in space technology show how there are virtually no limits to our achievements if only we can set our sights clearly on our mission and work diligently by acquiring and using our knowledge for the good of humanity. 

Many of you are probably aware that nearly 65% of our population is under the age of 35 years.  Tomorrow’s India will be powered by the dreams and ambitions, the character and competence of young people both those who are now in our educational institutions as well as those who are not able to join these institutions.  

If we can empower our youth with the right skills and attitudes, we will be able to fully realize the vast demographic dividend in the years to come. That is indeed a big challenge before the country today. 

The youth must be fully equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century with confidence and contribute to the shaping of a new world. 

But how can we really equip the young people – which includes the young students present here – to contribute in the best way? It is possible only if we turn our system around, including aspects of curriculum and evaluation, towards critical thinking. What Swami Vivekananda had said is most relevant in the contemporary context: “The education which does not help the common mass of people to equip themselves for life, which does not bring out the strength of character, spirit of philanthropy, and the courage of a lion – is it worth the name?”

We must rethink and re-orient our educational system in the context of the twenty first century when the concerns of ecology, of human welfare and the welfare of the planet are equally imperative. 

For the students receiving their degrees on what is a momentous occasion in their lives, these ideas have a great meaning and resonance.  It is certainly a privilege and an achievement to attain degrees of higher education at a premier university. Along with this justified sense of pride and achievement, there is also a sense of hope and expectation of what the future will bring.  And it is also a time for planning the next stage of life, and of working in the competitive environment we see around us.

There is also a greater social responsibility that youth has to shoulder. There is a need to exercise judgement in looking at social issues and be part of the traditions of tolerance and respect that are characteristic of our pluralistic culture. The means of communication that technology has provided us should be used to facilitate social harmony and to cultivate a culture of healthy and civilized discussion on many of the pressing problems such as class and gender inequalities, and the needs of the less privileged in society, which we need to address with empathy and sincerity. 

We have expanded access to higher education in our country and today, more and more students are studying in our educational institutions than ever before but what we have to still focus on is to raise the quality of education and ensure that we offer the best possible education to our young people. 

How do we build a quality institution? Like Punjab which is irrigated by 5 rivers, we have to have institutions which are continuously nourished by five important streams. What are these streams that create and nurture excellence? 

First, a quality institution must foster “inquisitiveness”, a spirit of discovery, research and exploration, a quest to expand the frontiers of knowledge.  

Second, the institution must actively support “innovativeness”, a creative, path breaking, out-of-the box thinking ability. 

Third, the institutional ethos must be “inspirational” that promotes excellence and a willingness to become active lifelong learners. 

Fourth, the academic approach should be “integrational” which encourages inter-disciplinary learning and collaborative learning across geographies and disciplines.

Fifth, the institutional climate should exemplify an “internalized value system” in the way faculty members work together and interact with students and how the governance structures promote openness, mutual respect and collegiality. 

I would urge the Vice Chancellor and his team to keep these facets as an overarching framework to forge ahead in their future efforts to make this prestigious university a knowledge hub we can all be proud of. 

I am glad to know that the university is focusing on several verticals in the domain of innovation and entrepreneurship and is also taking a leading role in consolidation and integration of knowledge clusters in the region. 

This is certainly a step in the right direction and needs further emphasis in the years to come.  I also compliment the university for entering into Memorandum of Understanding with more than 100 universities and research institutes both within India and outside. This exchange of ideas is bound to be very fruitful to propel Panjab University into higher orbit of academic excellence and leadership in the years to come. 

I am very happy that the University has been recognized by the UGC as the “University with potential for excellence in Biomedical Sciences” with facilities for stem cell Research and Drug development. 

I do hope all of you will collectively strive to create a brighter future for the university and build on the strengths you have inherited from your predecessors whose tireless efforts have made this such a premier institution of higher learning in the country. 

As the Chancellor of this University, I look forward to learning of your endeavours and achievements.  I wish you all the very best.

Jai hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that music has the power to overcome the tribulations of war and terrorism and sends the message of oneness.

Speaking at the “CHIRAGH” concert of the South Asian Symphony Orchestra at the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), in Mumbai today, Shri Naidu said that music speaks a universal language and transcends geographical boundaries and unites people.

Shri Naidu appreciated Dr. Ahmad Sarmast for training the young children from Afghanistan who performed at the concert overcoming such barriers. He said that the young performers have proved that their music symbolizes the best of the human spirit and speaks the universal language of peace and harmony.

The Vice President called upon organisations such as the South Asian Symphony Orchestra to carry the message of peace and non-violence and dispel the dark clouds of misguided minds that were unleashing sporadic spurts of mindless violence.

Shri Naidu said that events such as the Concert organised by CHIARGH showcase India and its people’s commitment towards cooperation and co-existence among all nations.

The Vice President wanted the members of the orchestra and musicians at large to become ambassadors for a new and resurgent South Asia. He asked them to re-capture the essence of ancient civilizational ethos such as - peace, compassion and co-existence and re-connect with the common cultural well springs that unite the region.

The South Asian Symphony Foundation established by Smt. Nirupama and Shri Sudhakar Rao, retired senior civil servants, has built a unique project – a Symphony Orchestra to unite the people of South Asia region, through the divine medium of music.

Saying that Music was a powerful art form that could transform the quality of our lives, Shri Naidu asked the South Asian Symphony Foundation to build a repertoire of indigenous music from the region and continue to spread the universal message of peace and brotherhood around the world.

The Vice President and the gathering  paid tributes by observing silence in the memory of those who lost their lives on the dastardly terror attack in Colombo, Sri Lanka recently.

The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri C. Vidyasagar Rao, more than 70 musicians from countries like Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, India and others, Orchestra Conductor Shri Viswa Subbaraman, founders of CHIRAGH, Smt Nirupama and Shri Sudhakar Rao and eminent musicians and art lovers from Mumbai were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""We are gathered here to witness an important occasion- one in which we show, that we, in India, as a country and people, are dedicated to cooperation and co-existence among all nations. The South Asian Symphony  Foundation established by Smt. Nirupama and Shri Sudhakar Rao, retired senior civil servants, has built a unique project – a Symphony Orchestra that unites the people of our region of South Asia, through the divine medium of music.

Music speaks a universal language. It transcends geographical boundaries and unites people. We, in India, have always maintained that musical gatherings are an effective form of yoga or spiritual discipline. That is exactly what an orchestra consisting of many musicians sets out to do. Each and every member of the orchestra has to concentrate deeply on his or her own instrument but at the same time synchronize it with other musicians. It is a supreme example of preserving your own identity and yet being a part of a larger, collaborative endeavour. In relations between nations and human beings, it is probably the ability to live and work together that can make all the difference.

The great composer, Robert Schumann said once that to send light into the darkness of men’s hearts – such is the duty of the artist.

Music is a powerful art form that can transform the quality of our lives. I believe that the South Asian Symphony Orchestra through its concert, Chiragh, will light the way forward so that cultural collaboration and dialogue, existing for long among South Asians, is further strengthened.

South Asia needs to be more integrated, economically and culturally, and our people-to-people ties and understanding must grow if we are to overcome the legacies of the past that have kept us apart, divided and distant from each other.

I am glad that the South Asian Symphony Orchestra includes musicians from many South Asian nations and the South Asian diaspora. The Orchestra is a beautiful community of sisters and brothers of different nationalities, dedicated to creative expression through music. It speaks the language of peace, it unites minds and transports us to a sublime experience.

We must not stop with this one concert alone. The South Asian Symphony Foundation must now think of building a repertoire of indigenous music from the region that can be played around the world. We are heirs to five thousand years of civilization in our region from  ancient Gandhara and the Hindu Kush mountains to the river waters of the Indus and the Ganga, from the mighty Himalayas to the Bay of  Bengal, and the Arabian Sea and onwards to the southern shores of Sri Lanka and the Maldives and the Indian Ocean. Let us celebrate this wealth of cultural traditions and musical cadences.

At the same time, you should plan concerts in other cities of the region and beyond.  I hope as time goes by, you will become one of the great orchestras of the world and be recognized  and lauded for the message of peace and coexistence that you embody.

Music training for the young children of the region is also important. This orchestra has some children from Kabul in Afghanistan who are profiles in courage. All of them are dedicated to their music and communicating through their art with the outside world, bringing fame and respect for their ancient country, overcoming the tribulations of war and terrorism and symbolizing the best of the human spirit. I salute them and their dynamic and most courageous teacher and leader, Dr. Ahmad Sarmast who is with us today.

This is the spirit that we must constantly encourage and foster and that is why the South Asian Symphony Orchestra must carry this message of peace and non-violence and dispel the dark clouds of misguided minds who are unleashing sporadic spurts of mindless violence.

The orchestra’s members can all be ambassadors for a new and resurgent South Asia. After all, South Asia has been a cradle of a great civilization founded on the principles of peace, compassion and co-existence. We must re-capture that essence of our ancient civilizational ethos. We must re-connect with the common cultural well springs that unite us.

I wish all the musicians of the Orchestra, the conductor Viswa Subbaraman, and the founders, Nirupama and Sudhakar Rao all the very best in their endeavours to promote peace and humanitarian dialogue and cooperation in the region of South Asia to which we all belong.

Jai Hind!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asked young doctors and people entering into medical profession to be compassionate towards the downtrodden sections and treat them with empathy and understanding. Asked them to view the profession as a mission to serve the people and not as a commercial vocation.

Addressing the 9th Convocation of the KLE Deemed University, in Belagavi, Karnataka today, the Vice President impressed upon the young graduates on the need to make high-quality medical care accessible to the last poor man in the queue.

Expressing concern over the rising costs of healthcare, Shri Naidu said that a large section of the population was unable to get the latest diagnostic and therapeutic tools and treat some of the hitherto incurable diseases like cancer and heart-diseases.

Opining that ensuring healthcare services were not only affordable but also accessible to the common man, the Vice President urged upon the private sector to join hands with the government in providing affordable healthcare through public-private partnership in order to ensure modern and state-of-the-art healthcare facilities in rural areas.

'While the governments are creating facilities right up to primary health centers, the private sector too should chip in to provide advanced diagnostic and treatment facilities in rural areas, he added.

Observing that non-communicable diseases were on rising in India due to a sedentary lifestyle, Shri Naidu said that poor dietary habits, consumption of alcohol and tobacco, among others, were leading rise in non-communicable diseases like obesity, hypertension, heart-diseases, diabetes and stroke.

To arrest this alarming trend, he wanted the medical fraternity to create adequate awareness among the people, particularly the youth on the hazards posed by modern-day lifestyle and unhealthy dietary habits.

Opining that there was a gradual erosion of human touch or human element in doctor-patient relationship, the Vice President said that doctors were not communicating adequately with the patients and rather performing their duty in a mechanical fashion. He wanted them to establish an effective communication with patients.

Saying that providing education to the masses would be the best way to empower them, the Vice President called up on institutions such as the KLE Society to complement efforts of government by providing affordable quality education to people living in rural areas.

Shri Naidu suggested to include subjects like bio-ethics, humanities and communication skills in the medical curriculum. He urged academic institutions also to ensure that youngsters develop adequate skills and competencies along with preventive health-care aspects particularly yoga, diet and exercises as a part of the curriculum.

The Chancellor of KLE Deemed University and the Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha), Dr. Prabhakar Kore, the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Dr. Vivek A. Saoji, the Members of the Board of Management, Deans of Faculties, Heads of the Institutions, Officials of the University, Faculty Members, students and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" I am happy to be here among you this morning for the 9th Convocation ceremony of the KLE Deemed University. At the outset, I congratulate all the graduating students for their success and also wish them a very bright future.

I thank Dr. Prabhakar Koreji for inviting me here for this solemn function and to interact with you all.  I am aware of the good work that the KLE Society and the KLE Deemed University are doing in the field of education and healthcare since many years and I was looking for an opportunity to visit Belagavi and this Deemed University.

I am told that the KLE Society was formed by seven dedicated teachers a century ago for the upliftment of the poor and downtrodden. They believed that providing education to the masses would be the best way to empower them. They started with few schools and colleges in those difficult times. They did all this by selling their property and collecting donations from house to house.  They were supported by some philanthropists.  I am happy to learn that even today the KLE Society is guided by the principles of philanthropy and charity envisioned by the forefathers of the KLE Society.  

It is heartening to know that the KLE Deemed University since its inception has been in the forefront of imparting quality education in all the streams of health sciences and doing well on the research front.

I am told that this University is among the leading universities in the country in private sector and is doing high quality research in ‘Maternal and New Born Health’. I compliment the faculty for the achievements.  I am also told that the KLE Deemed University provides for high quality health care in the city of Belagavi and in the vicinity of about 300 KMs with its 4000+ beds, with all the broad and super-specialties and modern laboratories.  These achievements speak highly of the visionary leadership of Dr. Prabhakar Kore and the dedication and hard work of the faculty and other staff.

Friends, as you all are aware, higher education, particularly in the health sector is witnessing rapid changes due to technological advancements. No doubt, latest diagnostic and therapeutic tools are helping in the diagnosis and treat some of the hitherto incurable diseases like cancer and heart-diseases. At the same time, many these technological advances are not available to the large section of population because of the high costs. 

We, therefore, need to keep a balance. The challenge before all of us is to ensure that healthcare services are not only affordable but accessible to the common man. The need of the hour is for the private sector to join hands with the government in providing affordable healthcare through public-private partnership.

I am glad that the Centre and several state governments have launched health insurance schemes for providing health coverage to the poor and the needy.

The youngsters, who are graduating today should always be compassionate towards the downtrodden sections and treat them with empathy and understanding. They should always view this noble profession as a mission to serve the people and not as a commercial vocation. I would like to impress upon the young graduates on the need to make high quality medical care accessible to the last poor man in the queue. Another major challenge that needs to be addressed on a priority basis is to ensure modern and state-of-art- healthcare facilities in the rural areas. While the governments are creating facilities right up to primary health centres, the private sector too should chip in to provide advanced diagnostic and treatment facilities in rural areas.

Thanks to the advances in medical science, the average life span of individuals has increased. So, now we have to cater to the needs of our elderly population.

However, one of the biggest concerns on the healthcare front is the rise in non-communicable diseases in India. Due to sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits, consumption of alcohol and tobacco, among others are leading rise in non-communicable diseases like obesity, hypertension, heart-diseases, diabetes and stroke.

The challenge before the medical faculty is to arrest this rising trend and create adequate awareness among the people, particularly the youth on the hazards posed by modern day lifestyle.

I am sure the future doctors will surely take up these challenges and come up with innovative solutions.

One of the things I have noticed in the wake of technological advancements in the medical field is the gradual erosion of human touch or human element in doctor-patient relationship. I feel that today’s doctors are not communicating adequately with the patients and rather performing their duty in a mechanical fashion—probably due to work pressure.

I think there should be an effective communication between the doctor and his/her patient. It should be remembered that doctors are treated like God by patients and the latter should always be treated with empathy and humanism. It is quite important to always uphold highest standards of ethics morals.

Medical courses curriculum should also include subjects like bio-ethics, humanities and communication skills.  I have also observed that focus of medical education has been on curative aspects rather than preventive aspects. I personally feel that the old saying ‘Prevention is Better Than Cure’ is very true and essential to be practiced in today’s era. 

Good, healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet, exercise in any form – yoga, meditation, physical exercise, etc. will go a long way in preventing and controlling many diseases.  I, therefore, urge you to emphasize on the preventive health-care aspects particularly yoga, diet and exercises as a part of curriculum.

While we have a highly compartmentalized healthcare delivery system with modern medicine (allopathy) on the one hand and the traditional medicines like Ayurveda, Homoeopathy and Naturopathy on the other,  the scope for integrating them wherever possible could be explored if it enables providing holistic treatment to an individual.

I am told that the KLE Deemed University has all these streams under one roof.  It is, therefore, possible for you to start integrative medicine care and provide integrative care to the patients for better health outcomes.

Dear sisters and brothers, as regards medical education, there has been a huge increase in the number of Colleges and Universities.  This in any way is a healthy sign.  However, we need to focus on the quality of education that we are imparting to our future citizens. In today’s globalized world, we have to ensure that our education standards are on par with the best in the world.

As we transit from a developing country to a developed country, we need to constantly update our and reorient our medical education, while ensuring that our youngsters develop adequate skills and competencies. More importantly, they need to develop the right attitude. As stated earlier, they should not treat medical profession as a vocation to only earn money  but must always be empathetic towards the downtrodden sections and contribute towards their upliftment.

Finally, my advice to the graduating students is to make your alma mater and parents proud of you and serve the society and the country to the best of your abilities. You are empowered with knowledge and necessary skills, it is time for you to prove your ability. Think innovatively, work hard and intelligently and make our motherland proud of your achievements.

I once again congratulate you on your success and convey my wishes for all your future endeavours! Let us all strive together build a new India.           

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has stressed the need to promote integrated farming practices to improve the productivity of livestock and double farmers’ income.

Delivering the 8th Convocation address of Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University, in Tirupati today, Shri Naidu said that Animal husbandry was vital for ensuring a more inclusive and sustainable agriculture system.

Referring to a study,  Shri Naidu said that there were no suicides in families of farmers who diversified into allied activities like poultry, dairy or aquaculture. He observed that farming households with livestock would be able to better withstand distress caused due to extreme weather conditions and crop failures.

Quoting NSSO statistics, estimates, the Vice President said that rural India had an estimated 90.2 million agricultural households and facilitating sustainable income for all these households must be the primary endeavor for everyone.

The Vice President said that a healthy and robust agricultural sector was an important prerequisite to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth in India. He called for measures to make farming a lucrative career opportunity, especially for the youth, by making agriculture economically viable and financially rewarding.

Saying that Agriculture industry contributes 17% of India’s total GDP, out of which, the 27% comes from Animal Husbandry and overall, the dairy, poultry and aqua industries contribute 4.4% to the nation’s GDP, the Vice President said that these numbers signify the crucial role played by these sectors in our economy.

Opining that livestock was integral to peoples’ lives and cattle wealth was crucial component of human existence, Shri Naidu said that it was the duty of every citizen to protect the precious national wealth.

Observing that the rural economy was dependent on agriculture and its allied sectors such as poultry, dairy and others, Shri Naidu said that the sector provides gainful employment to a large number of youngsters from rural areas. Shri Naidu urged upon Universities to encourage research on veterinary sciences.

The Vice President urged the government, agriculture scientists and Krishi Vigyana Kendras to encourage farmers to diversify into allied services for financial stability.  He opined that ensuring food security was crucial for India to harvest the dividend from its demographical advantage.

Shri Naidu said that poultry, fisheries, Sericulture, and other services have great potential to contribute towards employment and economic growth. He also stressed the need to conserve and improve the productivity of our indigenous breeds.

He urged Universities to continuously collaborate with each other and develop linkages with industries to develop human resource, augment technology and find solutions to problems faced by the farmers. 

Expressing concern over the mismatch in supply and demand of veterinary manpower in India, Shri Naidu tasked authorities to fill vacant positions in academic, R&D, extension and field institutions to serve the needs of farmers. He wanted all Veterinary Universities and Agricultural Universities to have engineering and IT Departments to make use of the endless possibilities of technology in general and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in particular.

Sri Naidu said the hallmark of Indian ethos has been the great reverence for nature and animals and the diverse flora and fauna were considered manifestations of the single divine principle pervading the entire universe. He opined that there could not be a more eloquent testimony of India’s commitment to preserving the planet’s biodiversity than its ancient Indian epics and rich iconography.

“This world view of ours was based on a symbiotic relationship between humanity and nature. It is this perspective that can make us realize sustainable development goals we have set for ourselves as a world community,” he said.

The Governor of Andhra Pradesh and the Chancellor of the University, Shri E.S.L. Narasimhan, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Dr. Y. Hari Babu, faculty, alumni and students of the University were also present on the occasion. 

Later the Vice President visited the Veterinary Pathology Museum maintained by the Department of Pathology and appreciated the efforts of the University for setting up one of India’s best facility. He said that the museum would give great exposure to students and researchers of veterinary pathology.

The museum is curated by Dr. N. R. Gopal Naidu and faculty of Department of Pathology, houses more than 500 specimens of animal diseases and is being preserved since 1960. The museum also has a display of eminent scientists and milestones of medical history from around the world.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I consider it a proud privilege to deliver the 8th Convocation address of this esteemed University that occupies a place of pride in the comity of State Veterinary Universities in the country.

My best wishes to young friends who are graduating from the portals of this centre of excellence in Veterinary, Fishery and Dairy Sciences.

This convocation ceremony is a crucial milestone as it marks a new beginning of your careers. Today, you will be granted degrees and medals which bear testimony to your hard work, perseverance, merit and scholarship. 

Let me take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to each one of you. 

A special mention has to be made of the hard work and dedication that your teachers had put in to bring out the best in you and to make you truly worthy of the degrees that are being conferred upon you today. India reveres the ‘Guru’ as being an earthly manifestation of the divine. 

I would also like to congratulate the parents of the graduating students for the sacrifices they make every day to enable their children get quality education.  It is because of your unconditional love, support and trust that your children are here today, receiving coveted degrees, making you proud. 

My dear young friends,

You have indeed chosen a noble profession!

Veterinary science is a multi-disciplinary subject which includes research on diagnosis, control, prevention and treatment of animal diseases and also deals with the basic zoology, welfare, and care of animals. 

It should be noted that all activities of animal science affect human health either directly or indirectly. Veterinary Science at a fundamental level is a human health activity.

Veterinary scientists protect the human health and well-being by ensuring food security and safety, preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases, protecting environment and ecosystem, advancing treatment and control of non-zoonotic diseases, contributing to public health, and engaging in medical research.

I am happy to know that Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University was the first in the country to start a Diploma Programme in Animal Husbandry. I understand that you have provided leadership by example to other Universities for developing much needed courses for para veterinary staff, thereby providing gainful employment to a large number of youngsters from rural areas. 

It is indeed a matter of great pride that the University has chosen Mahatma Gandhi’s words “The Greatness of a Nation and its Moral Progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated” as its motto.  

Indeed, livestock are integral to our lives. It is said that cattle wealth is national wealth.

We are a civilization that has, since time immemorial considered animals to be sacred beings. The deep respect for all life forms is an indestructible hallmark of our culture. The hallmark of Indian ethos has been the great reverence for nature and animals. 

The diverse flora and fauna are considered manifestations of the single divine principle pervading the entire universe. 

Among the ten incarnations of Vishnu are the fish, tortoise and the  boar. 

Gods and goddesses have birds and animals as their Vahanas or vehicles. 

Kartikeya rides on a peacock, Vishnu on an eagle and Saraswati on a swan. Krishna is known as Govardhana because he is a cowherd who protects and nurtures cows. Lord Shiva is also called “Pashupatinath” (the head of all animals) and has serpents as his ornaments and bull as his vehicle. Ganesha rides on a mouseand Durga on a tiger. Ramayana, our most ancient epic, has monkeys, bears and even squirrels helping the divine mission. 

Clearly, all birds and animals, big and small, wild and mild, have a value and are worth protecting and preserving. 

There can’t be a more eloquent testimony of our commitment to preserving our planet’s biodiversity than our ancient Indian epics and rich iconography.

This world view of ours was based on a symbiotic relationship between humanity and nature. 

It is this perspective that can make us realize the sustainable development goals we have set for ourselves as a world community. 

We have always attached tremendous importance to the welfare and humane treatment of animals even while using them for commercial purposes. 

 

My dear students, 

One of the important prerequisites for ensuring a sustainable and inclusive growth in India is to shape a healthy and robust agricultural sector. 

We have to make farming a lucrative career opportunity, especially for the youth, by making agriculture economically viable and financially rewarding, if we are to harvest the dividend from our demographical advantage comprehensively and ensure food security. 

Fortunately, you are directly connected with the farming community at the village level and can contribute substantially to the development of rural economy and empowerment of women through the fortification of the agriculture sector.  The national Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) estimates that rural India had an estimated 90.2 million agricultural households. Facilitating sustainable income for all these households should be your primary endeavour. 

Livestock production and agriculture are intrinsically linked and both are crucial for overall food security. Agriculture industry contributes 17% of India’s total GDP, out of which, the 27% comes from Animal Husbandry. 

Overall, the dairy, poultry and aqua industries contribute 4.4% to the nation’s GDP. The numbers signify the crucial role played by these sectors in our economy. They also employ nearly 16 million people across the nation. 

Animal husbandry is vital for ensuring a more inclusive and sustainable agriculture system. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) estimates that livestock is the principle source of income to nearly 23% of agricultural households in the country with very small land holdings of less than 0.01 hectares.   

Integrated farming practices will certainly help in doubling farmer's income by 2022. Hence ensuring health and improving productivity of our livestock is paramount.  

Farming households with livestock will be able to better withstand distress caused due to extreme weather conditions and crop failures. In fact, a study has shown that there were no suicides in families of farmers who diversified into allied activities like poultry, dairy or aquaculture. 

As you all are aware, India is the number one milk producing nation in the world since 1998. I compliment veterinary professionals and farmers for achieving this phenomenal distinction. Dairying has become an important secondary source of income for millions of rural families particularly for marginal and women farmers. 

Fisheries and Aquaculture sector has emerged as the single largest group in agricultural exports of India with 10.51 lakh tons in terms of Quantity and Rs. 33,442 crores in value. In view of India’s long coastline and abundant inland water bodies, aquaculture and fisheries have great potential to contribute towards employment and economic growth.

India is blessed with a huge biodiversity of indigenous cattle that have survived over hundreds of years in local habitats. But unfortunately, their number is declining.  

Hence, the need of the hour is to conserve and improve the productivity of our indigenous breeds.

I am glad that this University has taken up measures to conserve the two important cattle breeds of Ongole and Punganur and the native Nellore breed of sheep. It is also one of the 15 Invitro Fertilization Centers to conserve native breeds and improve their productivity.  

I urge Universities to continually collaborate with each other and develop linkages with industries to develop human resource, augment technology and find solutions to problems faced by the farmers. 

The National Bovine Genomics Centre for Indigenous Breeds (NBGC-IB) is one such scheme that will pave way indigenous animal improvement using highly precise gene-based technology. 

Some of the issues that require immediate attention are reproduction problems, shortage in livestock feed resources, disease prevalence, emergence of new diseases, climate stress and lack of adequate infrastructure for post-production preservation and value addition. 

To improve labor productivity and bargaining strength of farmers in the market, livestock, dairy and fishery sectors need greater on-farm value addition and processing.  

A quantitative analysis of the supply and demand of veterinary manpower in India reveals that there is a mismatch between the demand and supply of veterinarians in India. India needs 72,000 graduate veterinarians, but the current availability is about 43,000. India needs many more veterinarians to look after the huge livestock population and to fill positions in 50,000 academic, R&D, extension and field institutions.

My appeal to the academicians and administrators is to revamp and continually improve, expand and update the veterinary education system in our country to address these issues. 

All Veterinary Universities and Agricultural Universities should have engineering wings and most importantly IT Departments to make use of the endless possibilities of technology in general and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in particular.  

Conscious efforts should be made to usher innovation by leveraging technology. Let me place before you the example of e- pashuhaat, a web portal launched under the scheme ""National Mission on Bovine Productivity, which aims to connect breeders and farmers on the availability of bovine germplasm, thus eliminating middlemen.  

There is scope for many such innovations. New ideas should flow from universities and research centers. 

 

My dear students, 

You should be able to access new knowledge and use it for your advancement as also for the welfare of the people around you. Always remember that the ultimate aim of any technology or advancement is the betterment of the lives of people.  

Let me also remind you at this critical juncture of your lives to never falter when it comes to preserving the environment. 

Our biodiversity, our natural habitats, our forests and our oceans are being destroyed due to the reckless exploitation of natural resources and thoughtless disposal of waste. 

I urge each and every one of you to be crusaders on a mission to protect and conserve nature and all its life forms. 

As students of life sciences, you understand better than anyone, the nature of life. 

I encourage you to put your knowledge to the best possible use and do the best you can to reverse the consequences of the damage we have caused to the environment. 

Before I conclude I would like to remind you what the Mahatma Gandhi said: “A man of character will make himself worthy of any position he is given”.  

I hope that you will prove yourself worthy of the degrees that you are receiving today and any position of leadership that will be offered to you tomorrow. 

My best wishes to you all in your future endeavors!

 

Thank You!

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon to people to take a pledge to preserve and promote their mother tongue. Stressing that there was a need to strengthen the campaign for preserving mother tongue, he urged upon State governments to make mother tongue mandatory up to primary school level.

Expressing his keen interest in protecting native languages, the Vice President advised students to speak in their mother tongue at home.

Shri Naidu while addressing the gathering at the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of Kesari Schools, in Chennai today, he advised educational institutions to cultivate the quest for innovation and spirit of scientific thinking in children. He also laid foundation stone for construction of a new campus of Kesari School.

In order to make students become responsible citizenry, the Vice President tasked schools to create an atmosphere of joyful learning and revamp curriculum to teach students the stories of great freedom fighters and inculcate Indian values.

Observing that the 21st century world and the economic progress of a nation were increasingly becoming knowledge dependent, he insisted on training the changing aspects of technology right from the school level so that they adapt to the changing scenario.

Opining that being just literate should not be the aim of education, the Vice President said that real education must allow an individual to seek the truth, knowledge and develop logical thinking and a bent to understand and be sensitive to the needs of others.

Pointing out that education must help in transforming the lives of the poor, suppressed, and unreached and the marginalized sections of society, the Vice President opined that education was the most potent way to address challenges such as poverty, gender inequality, unemployment, discrimination, caste, and economic disparities.

Opining that women who constitute 50% of the population must be given equal opportunities, the Vice President said that educating the girl child and educating women was essential to India’s growth.  He called upon people to make campaigns such as Educating the Girl Child must become peoples movements.

The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit, the Sankaracharya of Kanchi, Jagadguru Vijayendra Saraswathi, the Chairman, KENCES Group of Companies, Shri K. Narsa Reddy, the Headmaster of Kesari Higher Secondary School, Shri N. Gopalaiah, the Grandson of late Dr. K.N. Kesari, Dr. K. Radhakrishnan and several other dignitaries were present at the venue.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon universities and institutions to constantly reform the system and ensure that higher education institutions deliver high-quality education.

Addressing the 9th Annual Convocation of VELS Institute of Science, Technology and Advanced Studies (VISTAS), in Chennai today, Shri Naidu referred to the transient nature of technology in a fast-evolving world and advised the students to regularly update their knowledge and skills to carve a niche in their chosen fields.

Stressing that quality higher education was necessary for accelerating the progress and development of our country, the Vice President wanted institutions of higher learning to open new horizons of knowledge and research at their institutions. Observing that one must not ignore rural India in our quest to scale new heights of growth, he called for an inclusive and all around development.

Stating that technology was a great democratic leveler, Shri Naidu asked students and the youth to take care of the technological needs of our villages, agriculture and allied industry.  He called for leveraging technology's potential for rural development and bridging the rural-urban divide.

The Vice President said that the technology must provide solutions to the issues of rural life and economy. He further said that India lives in its villages and the development of our country depends on rural India. You have a promising faculty in Pharmacy your institute should think of starting programs in Agriculture, Horticulture and Veterinary Science, he added.

Shri Naidu asked the students and the youth to not to fall prey to the distractions of modern lifestyle and he advised them to shun junk food to stay healthy.  While expressing concern over the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, he advised everybody to change their lifestyles and food habits.

The Vice President presented Honoris Causa Awards to the Secretary, Department of Defence R&D and Chairman, DRDO, Dr. G. Satheesh Reddy, the retired Indian track and field athlete, Smt. P.T. Usha and the Chairman of Kerry Indev Logistics Pvt. Ltd., Mr. S. Xavier Britto.

The Founder Chairman and Chancellor of VELS University, Dr. Ishari K. Ganesh, the Vice Chancellor of VELS University, Dr. P. Swaminathan, the Members of the Board of Management and Academic Council, students, and faculty of the institute and several other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It is a pleasure to address the young graduates on this occasion of the Ninth Convocation of          Vels Institute of Science, Technology and Advanced Studies (VISTAS). It gives me an  opportunity to know about their aspirations, expectations and dreams for their future. And share my own with them.   In the life of a student, Convocation is a mile-stone.  It is the outcome of their hard work. It marks their transition from students to professionals, moving from one level of education to the next higher level.

I am told that today 68 Ph.D. scholars, 145 M.Phil. Scholars, 363 Post-Graduates and 1766 Graduates will be receiving their degrees.  I congratulate all the students who are graduating from this university today and wish them every success in their future endeavours.  I also compliment the members of the faculty and the parents for the success of these students. Teachers and parents shape the young minds and the destiny of our society.  And we as a nation are ever grateful to the tireless teachers who mould the citizens of tomorrow with dedication and empathy.

Young Friends, 

It is an occasion when you will move out of the insulated life of the campus and explore the exiting new world of work. It is also the occasion when you will carry with yourself the high ideals you have imbibed during your stay in this esteemed institution.

As you move out of the campus, never let your inquisitiveness and quest for knowledge be extinguished. Dr. Babasaheb Ambedker said, “Cultivation of mind should be the ultimate aim of human existence.” So please continue to expand the ‘VISTAS’ of your knowledge. As the treasure house of wisdom, Thirukurral says “The deeper you dig in a sandy bed, more the water flows, the deeper you learn, the greater will be your wisdom.”

Upgrading your knowledge is ever more essential today as we live in a world where every technology is only transient. You are starting your professional career at a very exciting time. You are sitting on a rapidly moving knowledge cyberways. Entire new horizon of global opportunities opens up with a click of a mouse. You need to constantly update your knowledge and skills to create the niche for yourself in the global job market.  

I am happy to note that even though yours is a young institution established in 2008, it is offering courses in sunrise areas. It is heartening that it has expanded both in basic sciences as well as applied science and technology like aviation and maritime studies, life sciences and pharmacy, Management and Law. 

Being a young institution there is a vast scope of improvement and experimentation particularly on parameters like research and professional practices as well as graduation outcomes. It is essential for the institutions of higher learning to re-invent themselves, open new horizons of knowledge and research. 

I appreciate the role of your institution in making higher education inclusive.  Happy to note that there are many students from socially disadvantaged groups in the under graduate programme and in Post Graduate programme. 

Friends, 

While the Constitution recognizes Right to Education a Fundamental Right and makes it incumbent upon the ‘State to  provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years…’, higher education is equally essential ‘to develop  the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform’ which are envisaged as the Fundamental Duties of the citizens. Therefore, quality higher education is necessary for the progress and  development of our country.  

Before Independence in India, access to higher education was very limited and elitist. Since independence, the growth has been very impressive.  More than 850 universities and more than 40,000 Colleges are offering various programmes in India.

Though we have expanded the number of higher education institutions, the quality of higher professional education, remains a major concern. Various studies and surveys have raised concern over the learning outcomes and employability of Indian graduates. We must address these issues and constantly reform the system and ensure that the higher education institutions deliver high quality education. 

Friends, 

India is a young nation with 65% of our population being below 35 years. Every year almost 1 crore youth join the job market. It is the demographic dividend we as a nation can ill-afford to lose. 

We are in midst of 4th Industrial revolution. The technology is changing exponentially. The new age technologies like Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and 3D Printing, are changing the ways we live and work.

You, as innovator entrepreneurs and global professionals, will be required to outpace this change. The faculty members shall have to be abreast with the latest technological developments. You must become more agile and alert to stay ahead of the knowledge curve.

With a view to making education a lifelong learning process and to expand the horizons of knowledge, the Government has launched SWAYAM online Courses. It is now providing opportunities of online higher education. I expect you to make use of these facilities. 

I am happy to learn that VISTAS has entered into MoU with several foreign universities and institutions. India has traditionally been open to knowledge exchange with other parts of the world. 

For ages we have been the Vishwa Guru. We have shared our knowledge with the wider world and received their scholars in our Universities like Texila and Nalanda. We believed in the anicient vedic dictum “ Aano Bhadrah Kritvo Yantu Vishwatah…”  May the noble thoughts and wisdom come to us from all over the world. That is spirit we must infuse in our educational institutions today. 

Friends, 

Often, when we discuss professional education, we tend to ignore the technological needs of our villages, of agriculture and allied industry. Technology is a great democratic leveler; we must leverage its potential for rural development and bridging the rural- urban divide. Technology must provide solutions to the issues of rural life and economy.   India lives in Villages. The development of our country depends on rural India. You have a promising faculty in Pharmacy.  I will suggest that VISTAS should think of starting programs in Agriculture, Horticulture   and Veterinary Science.

I am also happy to learn that at VISTAS, ‘YOGA’ is made compulsory and part of curriculum. 

I have also learnt that VISTAS is implementing National Service Scheme as a part of the Curriculum and that VISTAS has adopted nearby villages. I congratulate you for your commitment to these public causes. 

Friends, 

While you must rejoice and celebrate your achievements, you must also realize that you are at the threshold of a vast unchartered territory. The knowledge and the values you have imbibed will be your leading lights. You must chalk out the future course with careful consideration. The bottom line is how you can lead a fulfilling life personally and professionally and contribute to the quality of life of people around you. As Thirukkural says:“ Learn all that is to be learnt and Live true to it”. 

I wish you all success in your endeavors.

Thank you. Jai Hind.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asked the youngsters and students to use science and technology and their intellect to bring in a positive change in the lives of people.

Addressing the 1st Convocation of Indian Institute of Information Technology, Sri City (IIIT Sri City), in Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh today, Shri Naidu called upon the youth to make impactful contributions to the society by providing solutions to pressing problems of the nation such as poverty, illiteracy, climate change, hidden hunger, urban-rural divide, and others.

Asking students to set new benchmarks and try to achieve them with sincerity, discipline and hard work, the Vice President advised them not to remain complacent and to put in optimal efforts to reach their goals.

Opining that Universities and Institutes of Excellence such as IIT, ISB, IIM and IIITs must instill leadership qualities in students, he suggested revamping the teaching methodologies to develop a quest for learning in students. He called upon institutions such as the IIIT Sri City to strive to become centers of excellence with global standards by offering a holistic and quality higher education to students.

The Vice President while expressing concern over poor global ranking of Indian Higher Educational Institutions, stressed the need to completely revamp the higher education system. He asked universities to play a leading role by incorporating relevant changes in curriculum, teaching methodologies and research strategies to make India a hub for global learning.

Observing that economic prosperity must ensure equitable development, Shri Naidu called for a special focus on bridging the urban-rural divide in education, health, and other areas. He also stressed upon the need to ensure inclusive development to create a harmonious society where different sections of the society could get access to the wealth created. 

The Vice President said that academic institutions with all technical and human resources must encourage their students to work with local societies and offer technology-based solutions to the problems faced by them. He also wanted the academic institutions to maintain regular coordination with industry and the government to prepare the students for jobs of the future.

Pointing that Indian economy was expected to register a growth rate of 7.3 percent this fiscal and 7.5 percent in 2020, Shri Naidu wanted the universities, institutions of higher learning to play a key role in India’s growth story. He tasked them to maximize the potential of India's demographic dividend by imparting employable skills and also provide training to youth.

The Chairman of Board of Governors of IIIT, Sri City, Shri Srinivasa Raju, the Director of IIIT Sri City, Prof. G. Kannabiran, the Managing Director of IIIT, Sri City, Shri Ravi Sanna Reddy, the Members of the Board of Governors, faculty members, staff, students and their parents and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am extremely happy to be part of the maiden convocation of IIIT Sri City. I congratulate and offer my best wishes to the first batch of graduating students of this institute for achieving an important milestone in your lives. It indeed is a proud moment for all the students and their parents as well. My best wishes to you all!

It gives me immense pleasure to come back to IIIT Sri City for this convocation as I had attended the Foundation Stone laying ceremony in 2015. As Minister for Urban Development, I had inaugurated the Centre for Smart Cities at the institute.

IIIT Sri City is uniquely located in a large and modern industrial city consisting of leading MNCs and domestic industries. There probably is no other institute with this kind of advantage. Other IIITs in PPP mode have few Industry Partners to support those institutes. This industry partner, Sri City, is enabling access to more than 100 companies that operate from here.

I am happy to note that IIIT Sri City has made significant achievements in the first few years. The role of Industry Partners, Sri City Foundation and Sri City Private Ltd deserve special appreciation. Shri Srinivasa Raju, Chairman and Shri Ravi Sanna Reddy, Managing Director, have been instrumental in ensuring this phenomenal growth.

I am confident that this institute will achieve greater heights and evolve as a centre of excellence in IT education and research.

Dear students,

You are the proud first batch graduating from this institution.  I am sure that as the first batch you must have set a good example for others to follow. In other words, you will be trailblazers to whom successive batches will be looking up to. Irrespective of whether you pursue higher studies or take up a job, strive to excel in your chosen field. Make your alma mater and parents feel proud of you. As you progress in your career, never remain complacent but set new benchmarks and try to achieve them with sincerity, discipline and hard work. Commit yourselves to put in optimal efforts and I am sure you will come out with flying colours. I once again wish you all the very best!

I would like to share few thoughts to the graduating students, faculty and others who have gathered on this august occasion.

As you all are aware, India was once known as Vishwaguru and was a leading economy in the world. India was home to the best learning centres and scholars from across the globe used to come here to study at Nalanda, Takshashila and Pushpagiri.              

Dear students, we must strive to regain our leadership position in the world as we enter into a new era of opportunities and challenges. India is the fastest growing large economy in the world. Our economy is expected to register a growth rate of 7.3 per cent this fiscal and 7.5 per cent in 2020, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF). Similar, projections were made by other global agencies. It is predicted that India will be in top three economies of the world in the next two decades. India is set to become a $ 10 trillion economy in the next 10-15 years.

With India emerging as an economic leader, abundant opportunities will arise for young graduates like you. You will be witnessing and participating in India’s transformation. India also has a unique advantage of a young population. About 65 per cent of our population is below the age of 35 years. No other country is blessed with such a huge human resource capital as India. We must maximise the potential of this human resource by imparting skills and training and accelerate the growth of our economy.  For achieving all this, our universities, institutions of higher education and various centres of learning must play a transformational role.

Today we have more than 900 universities across the length and breadth of the country. But none figures in the top 200 universities in the world. Merely adding more and more universities is not enough. Numbers are important, but quality is more important. We need to completely revamp our higher education system to make it one of the best in the world. Our universities must play a leading role in this endeavour and make India again a hub for global learning. To start with, our universities must aim to be among the top 100 institutions in the world.

Our institutions must strive to achieve extraordinary results in a short span of time. They need to adopt a systematic approach for goal setting by comprehensively reorienting the teaching methods, research strategies and setting high academic standards on par with global institutions.

I am happy to know that IIIT Sri City has inducted qualified faculty and initiated strategic planning process. I am sure that all the stakeholders will contribute to achieve the desired goals with the support of Industry Partners.  

No institution can insulate itself from the unpredictability of technological progression and disruption. The future of the work will not be dependent on degrees but on skills. The jobs of tomorrow will be vastly different from the present-day jobs and therefore the universities and the industry must join hands to prepare the students for jobs of the future.

The success of institutions is not about what we do in the next few years, but it is our ability to create future-ready professionals. 

Information Technology has become all pervasive. Advances in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Big Data, Computer vision, Internet of Things shall create new opportunities to create economic value. I am sure institutions like IIIT Sri City will focus on these aspects in their programmes of study and research.

Again, I am happy to note that IIIT Sri City has initiated efforts to launch specialized programmes of study in the area of Cyber Security, Data Analytics, AI & Machine Learning, Block Chain, FinTech and Smart Manufacturing with a focus to offer specialized human resources to the industry. 

I am of the firm view that economic prosperity should ensure equitable development. Close to 65 percent of people in India still live in villages and top priority has to be accorded to bridging the urban-rural divide in education, health and other areas.  We need to ensure that our development is inclusive, where different sections of the society have access to the wealth created, so that we are able to create a harmonious society. Due to size and complexity, governments alone can no longer deliver social development programmes.  Academic institutions with all technical and human resources have to integrate such programmes with funding from governments and industry. Students will have an opportunity to work with local societies to offer technology-based solutions to the problems faced by them. I am happy to note that IIIT Sri City has adopted five villages under Unnat Bharat Abhiyan to support development activities. 

The much cited demographic dividend of India is both an opportunity and challenge. It is an opportunity because of the number of people in the working class is more as compared to many nations. It is directly linked to faster economic growth and prosperity. On the other hand, this may become a burden to the nation if we are not able to provide right education and skills to make our youth employable. Given the present status of relatively low levels of employability among graduates, we need to focus on appropriate programmes of study and provide opportunities to acquire skills that match the requirements of emerging jobs.

We need to continue to strive for enabling an inclusive mind-set among our youth. I am sure our academic institutions will make focused efforts to provide an inclusive learning environment in which collective achievements are celebrated.  

As you progress in your life, you will be fulfilling various commitments towards your family, friends and organizations that you work for. Today, you have yet another important commitment of serving the nation. 

India has many opportunities but many problems also need to be managed. You need to make impactful contributions to the society by leveraging the opportunity or solving the problems of the nation. I urge you not to get overwhelmed by the challenges you face. Start in a small way, align yourself with any of the national programmes and create or join a network of individuals who share a common passion to bring changes in lives of the people.  Remember, Small acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the nation.

Dear students, always remember the core philosophy of India from time immemorial has been to share and care. While you acquire wealth and celebrate success, you must always pay attention to the needs of others, particularly the deprived sections. Being helpful to others who are in need has to be our way of life.  Feel privileged that you are like a candle that brings light into the lives of others.

I once again wish you all the very best in career and life. I am sure IIIT Sri City will strive to become a world class institution in the coming years with the support of Industry partners.

Thank you,

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that a world-class higher education system was the need of the hour. Addressing students and faculty members of REVA University after inaugurating the State-of-the-art Architecture Block in the campus at Bengaluru today, he said that India’s quest for development would remain unfulfilled if we fail to create opportunities for quality higher education till the last mile.

Pointing out that concerns have been raised over the imbalance between excellence and inclusion, the Vice President called for revamping of higher education system to make more equitable and inclusive.

Shri Naidu said that we have tremendous talent amongst us and we cannot afford to let this talent lie dormant due to lack of avenues for quality education, especially higher education and skill training. He called for putting vulnerable sections of our population, the women, the differently-abled and the economically weak at the center of our strategy to expand higher education.

Observing that rapid industrialization and economic growth would create opportunities for around 250 million skilled workforces by 2030, Shri Naidu asserted that India would emerge as the global supplier of skilled manpower in the coming years.

The Vice President said that despite the progress made from the time of Independence, higher education system in India still suffers from a number of lacunae ranging from inadequate enrolment to quality issues to lack of equity and insufficient infrastructure. Observing that research was the cornerstone of higher education systems world over, the Vice President called upon institutions of high learning to create an environment for students to be innovative and creative.

Saying that advanced research was the way forward for India’s higher education, Shri Naidu called upon colleges and universities to equip their institutions with latest technologies and re-invent the teaching methodology.

The Vice President wanted institutions of higher education to focus on nurturing students with employable skills. He also suggested them to actively promote linkages between academic institutions, the industry, and the government to prepare students to suit the demands of the industry and train them to perform new age jobs.

The Chancellor of REVA University, Dr. P. Shyama Raju, the Vice Chancellor of REVA University, Dr. S.Y. Kulakarni, the Registrar of the University, Dr. M. Dhanamjaya, the Trustees of the University, Shri Bhasker Raju and Umesh Raju and other dignitaries were present at the event.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" I am delighted to be here at REVA today, a campus that is a nucleus of brimming activity, amidst some of the brightest minds of the country.

Your campus is a true manifestation of the strong surge of energy and vigor of a young India.

Let me congratulate Dr Shyama Raju for his dedicated service to the nation in the field of education.

One of the most effective ways to cement a nation’s pathway towards growth and development is through a robust framework for quality professional education, an endeavour that is being taken to fruition by Dr Shyama Raju and his dedicated team.

I am glad to hear that REVA educates a large number of students from rural background. I am sure that REVA and its team of dedicated faculty will offer nothing but the best to every single one of its students. 

My dear friends,

I am delighted to inaugurate the Architecture block of REVA University today. 

I am told that this campus of REVA is home to 15000 talented students studying in diverse disciplines such as Engineering, Architecture, Management, Commerce, Humanities, Legal Studies and Performing Arts.

I firmly believe that students from varying disciplines should study together and interact with one another as frequently as possible to develop wider perspectives and accommodate  contrarian view points. 

This is, after all, the era of interdisciplinary studies. Aristotle once said, ‘It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it’.

My dear sisters and brothers,

In ancient India, the ‘Gurukula’ system of education thrived, where students resided in the ashrams or the homes of the Gurus. 

The very word ‘Gurukula’ is a combination of two words, ‘Guru’, the master and the ‘kula’, the home. Students were not discriminated against on the basis of caste or creed and every student was involved in the activities of the ashrama.

The Gurukula was a place of acceptance, of harmony and of brotherhood and camaraderie, a safe haven for all those who pursued wisdom.

Your ‘Kula’ or home has been built well, it is now upto the Gurus and the shishyas to ensure that they make the best use of the facilities available here.

Let this abode of wisdom and scholarship become the modern day Gurukula where there is no place for prejudices and where the light of learning will dispel the darkness of all human vices.

My dear young friends,

Today India needs a world class higher education system, a mission that is of paramount importance, especially in the light of the burgeoning youth population in the country. 

India has one of the youngest populations in the world and the window of demographic dividend opportunity is available for five decades from 2005-06 to 2055-56, longer than any other country in the world. 

India will have the second largest graduate talent pipeline globally by the end of the year 2020. India’s economy is also expected to grow at a fast pace. Rapid industrialization would require a workforce of around 250 million by 2030.

India will certainly emerge as a global supplier of skilled manpower.

We have tremendous talent amongst us. We cannot afford to let this talent lie dormant due to lack of avenues for quality education, especially higher education and skill training.

According to World Bank estimates, India's higher education system is the world's third largest in terms of students, next to China and the United States. 

Very soon, India will be one of the largest education hubs and learning destinations in the world. 

India's Higher Education sector has witnessed a tremendous growth in the number of Universities, University level Institutions and Colleges since Independence.

But we have a long way to go. Our higher education system still suffers from a number of lacunae ranging from inadequate enrolment to quality issues to lack of equity and insufficient infrastructure.

While it is true that access to quality higher education has improved in the last decade with more IITs, IIMs and Central and State-level universities being established, concerns have been raised about the imbalance between excellence and inclusion.

Let me remind you that our quest for development will remain unfulfilled if we fail to create opportunities for quality higher education till the last mile. Vulnerable sections of our population, the women, the differently-abled and the economically weak should be at the centre of our strategy to expand higher education. 

Today, we are in the middle of Industry 4.0. There is widespread disruption due to technology and automation that are changing the nature of jobs and learning and we have to adapt fast to the changing scenario.

We need to create campuses that are integrated with latest technologies, which empower students to innovate and create. India should be a technology leader and not a follower.

New fields such as cyber security, robotics, digital technology, artificial intelligence, data-science, block chain and internet of things have the potential to transform the world. In this context, India must be innovative in approach and work out policies to boost research and optimally tap the demographic potential. 

Statistics reveal that there were only 216 researchers per million in 2015. India’s investment in research is 0.62 per cent of its GDP. These numbers are well below global standards. 

Research is the cornerstone of higher education systems world over. Advancing research should be the way forward for India’s higher education.

There is also a need to re-invent the teaching methodology in our centers of higher education.

The world is now experimenting with several effective teaching methodologies such as e-learning, simulation and role-playing, problem based learning and blended learning. India must also adopt best practices from all over the world to improve instruction.

There is also a need to train our teachers and equip them with better skill-sets and latest tools to effectively educate students in this era of digital technologies.

Institutions of higher education must also focus on nurturing employable skills.

The new Annual Employability Survey 2019 report by Aspiring Minds reveals that 80% of Indian engineers are unsuited for any job in the knowledge economy and only 2.5% of them possess tech skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that industry requires.

This is a matter of great concern.

Ad-hoc changes and quick fix solutions will not remedy the problem of employability. We have to actively promote linkages between academic institutions, the industry and the government so that we succeed in preparing our graduates to suit the demands of the industry and perform new age jobs.

Students must also be encouraged to undertake internships, live projects and corporate interactions which provide practical insights into how the industry operates and expose them to workplace realities. Current estimates say that less than 40% of our engineering graduates opt for internships.

I am very happy to know that REVA University has its own Industry Interaction Centre.

Quality education in India is still very expensive. Education should not be a business, but must be looked upon as a mission to build a better world.

Institutions of higher education have the potential to become the most crucial change agents in the society. Education is a powerful tool to reduce or eliminate income and wealth disparities. 

I would also urge the Indian universities to continually engage and collaborate with world class academic institutions in different parts of the world. 

The world is a global village and we have to ensure that we mould global, cosmopolitan citizens who are at ease in any part of the world. 

My dear young friends, 

I do not, for a second, believe that education is meant solely for employment. Education has a much higher purpose.

Education teaches us values, stimulates our intellect, develops tolerance and encourages us to question the absurd and equips us to contribute to the growth of the human society. True education opens up your mind and trains you to think critically, practically and creatively. It fosters empathy, kindness and humility.

I understand that the School of Architecture at REVA is participating in the Smart City Project. I am sure that your contribution in planning of cities, ensuring sustainability and energy conservation will bring about a paradigm shift in urban planning.

I hope this University continues to provide quality education and remains committed to the pursuit of excellence.

I wish you all the best in all your future endeavors!

Jai Hind

Thank you!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has expressed anguish over continued terror attacks in various parts of the world and called upon international agencies such as the United Nations to conclude deliberations on the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, put forth by India to criminalize all forms of international terrorism and deny terrorists, their financiers and supporters access to funds, arms and safe havens.

 

Shri Naidu urged upon the world community to initiate concerted action to eliminate the scourge of terrorism from the face of the earth.

 

Addressing the 54th Annual Convocation of Bangalore University, in Bengaluru today, Shri Naidu said it was high time that the world takes concerted action to deal with the inhuman menace of terror by alienating those aiding abetting and encouraging terror as a state policy. ‘Mere condemnation and compensation will not suffice. We have to contain and root out terror in all its forms by going to the root cause’, he added.

 

Pointing out that world over, thousands of innocent people were being killed and still the world community, the Vice President opined that without attaining peace, progress would have no meaning.

 

Expressing anguish over the barbaric terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, which claimed the lives of several innocent people, Shri Naidu said India stands in solidarity with the Sri Lankan Government and its people in this hour of distress.

 

The Vice President observed that higher education must transcend the barriers of caste, creed, religion and gender. He pointed that the principles of social equity and gender parity were of paramount concern as far as higher education was concerned. Providing quality education on par with global standards was the need of the hour, he added. 

 

Reminding the gathering about India’s illustrious heritage, Shri Naidu said that India must resurrect the glory of the bygone era and take up the production and dissemination of knowledge on a wide scale through initiatives such as the digitization of higher education through expansion of online courses, massive open online courses (MOOC) courses and distance education..

 

The Vice President called upon higher educational institutions to promote interactive academic programs with diverse specializations and facilitate convergence of disciplines. ‘The system of Higher education must prepare the youth to be competent enough to serve the current techno-capitalist world system and its knowledge economy’, he added. 

 

Observing that a knowledge oriented paradigm of development would enable India to leverage its tremendous demographic advantage, the Vice President stressed that greater emphasis must be accorded to a skill based education by incorporating a three-pronged strategy of ‘skill, reskill and unskill’ as well as ‘learn, relearn and unlearn’.

 

The Vice President said there was a need to revamp and reform our higher education system to not only make our institutions global centres of learning but also to ensure that the students were able to meet challenges posed on the employment front.

 

Expressing his concern that the Gross Enrolment Ratio in Higher Education in India was a mere 27 per cent when compared to USA and China, with 85.8% and 43.4 % respectively, the Vice President called for measures to enhance the Gross Enrolment Ratio.

 

The Governor of Karnataka and  the Chancellor  of  Bangalore University, Shri Vajubhai Vala, the Vice Chancellor of Bangalore University, Prof. K.R. Venugopal, the Registrar of Bangalore University, Prof. B.K. Ravi, the Registrar (Evaluation) of Bangalore University, Prof. C. Shivaraju, the Awardees of Honorary Degree, the Members of the Syndicate, Academic Council, Invited Dignitaries, Faculty and Staff Members, Students and their parents were present at the event.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“First of all, let me extend my hearty congratulations to those who are graduating today from this institution which has a reputation for excellence. 

 

Today, you have reached a significant landmark in your academic career as well as in life,which would not have been possible without your dedication and hard work.

 

Let me also appreciate the faculty members for preparing the students to achieve this goal by providing them quality education, training and guidance.

 

Swami Vivekananda once said that “Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in human being”. I am sure that those of you, who are passing out from the portals of this great citadel of wisdom today, will realize your true potential and contribute your best in the process of nation building. 

 

My dear Sisters and Brothers and youngsters

 

Today, our universities have to perform multiple roles such as creating new epistemologies, acquiring new capabilities and producing an intelligent human resource pool through teaching and research. 

 

They are vested with the power to provide a new direction to India’s Higher Education System. They hold the sacred responsibility of elevating India to the position it once held, that of being the Vishwaguru, the teacher to the world.

 

Higher education is instrumental in building up a knowledgeable citizenry which possesses critical consciousness, the most vital requirement of a democratic nation. 

 

The promotion of interactive academic co-existence amongst scholars of diverse specializations, facilitating convergence of disciplines and creation of a platform of critical pedagogy for effective learning across interfaces of established disciplines needs to be re-emphasized. This is after all an era of interdisciplinary learning. 

 

Over the past few decades, several non- conventional areas of knowledge cutting across physical, natural and social sciences have emerged as a result of researches beyond disciplinary boundaries, thus letting disciplines move closer to one another.

 

The system of Higher education must prepare the youth to be competent enough to serve the current techno-capitalist world system and its knowledge economy. 

 

The ability of a nation to use and create knowledge capital determines its capacity to empower and enable its citizens to explore their innate potentials to the full possible extent.

 

Today India has the largest number of young people in world and therefore will be contributing the largest labour force to the world economy. Following a knowledge oriented paradigm of development would enable India to leverage its tremendous demographic advantage. 

 

But there are daunting challenges which need to be overcome. 

 

The foremost challenge is to ensure affordability and accessibility of higher education to all. Access parity is at stake due to commercialization of education and commoditization of knowledge.  

 

It is imperative that the principles of social equity and gender parity be of paramount concern as far as higher education is concerned. 

 

It must be accessible to all sections of society and must transcend the barriers of caste, creed, religion and gender. 

 

Pedagogic practices and curricular frameworks must prepare teachers to critique, be critiqued and to learn even at the cost of putting themselves in unfamiliar territories. 

 

The National Knowledge Commission report states that currently the Gross Enrolment Ratio in Higher Education in India is 27% whereas for USA and China, it is 85.8 and 43.4 % respectively. 

 

This statistical representation is a telling indicator of our under-utilized potential pertaining to Higher education. 

 

While there is a need to meet the growing educational needs in the higher education sector, merely adding numbers would not serve the purpose. The need of the hour is to provide quality education on par with global standards, while making rapid strides towards enhancing the Gross Enrolment Ratio.

 

We know of our illustrious heritage as far as higher education is concerned since time immemorial. 

 

It was in ‘Bharatvarsha’ that world renowned universities like Nalanda and Takshashila flourished. It was said that there were 1500 teachers for 10000 students in these historic universities. Documentation of knowledge through an excellent team of translators had also empowered scholars from different parts of the world to come there to study, teach and pursue research. 

 

There were great mathematicians like Bhaskara and astronomers like Varahamihira who made India the capital of wisdom. 

 

India must resurrect this glory of the bygone era and take up the production and dissemination of knowledge on a wide scale through initiatives such as the digitization of higher education through expansion of online courses, massive open online courses (MOOC) courses, distance education etc. 

 

The digital revolution must make possible a wider accessibility of higher education for all and greater emphasis has to be accorded to a skill based education by incorporating a three-pronged strategy of ‘skill, reskill and unskill’ as well as ‘learn, relearn and unlearn’. 

 

Laying a robust foundation through the creation of a strong base of natural sciences like Physics, Chemistry, and Biology would promote scientific temper and create a congenial ambience for scientific research. It is also important to patent our indigenous knowledge and medicine.

 

I have been emphasising upon the need to revamp and reform our higher education system to not only make our institutions global centres of learning but also to ensure that the students passing out of these institutions are able to meet challenges posed on the employment front.

 

We must transform our higher education system and create world class pedagogical spaces that nurture the intellectual competencies of our students and contribute the best of human resources to the world economy.

 

Wonderful opportunities are awaiting you and you must make the best possible use of the knowledge and skills you have acquired. You should be lifelong learners and continue acquire new skills to address the complex issues of our time. 

 

I urge each one of you to strive to leave a unique footprint of yours in this world by being a path-breaker.

 

It is vital in our contemporary postcolonial context that we strive towards the preservation and development of our regional ‘Bhashas’ and the mother tongue. It is important to preserve our linguistic and cultural heritage and diversity. 

 

At the same time, acquiring proficiency in English has become absolutely essential in the global context.

 

My dear young friends, 

 

As you step out of the institute and start your career, you will find that individual efforts in combination with team work will guide you to greater success and in achieving major milestones in your professional career.

 

I am sure that this institution will achieve greater heights in imparting high quality education and in nurturing a skilled youth force, fully equipped and capable of taking India to its rightful place at the helm of world affairs as a global leader.

 

Once again, I congratulate all the graduating students, their parents and teachers and extend my best wishes to this university.

 

Thank You!

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has urged the medical fraternity to create awareness among the people, particularly the youth, on the dangers posed by changing lifestyles. 

Shri Naidu, after inaugurating a free Medical Camp at Swarna Bharat Trust, in Hyderabad today, expressed his concern over the rising trend of non-communicable diseases and urged people to avoid sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy dietary habits.

The Vice President asked youth to shun junk food and pointed out that traditional Indian food was time-tested, seasonal and suitable to Indian climatic conditions.

Stressing the need for building a healthy nation, the Vice President said that the spread of non-communicable diseases, unequal access to healthcare and rising costs were the major challenges in the healthcare sector. Calling for concerted efforts to remedy the situation, he said all stakeholders, including NGOs, government agencies, hospitals and doctors should join hands right from the community level in this regard.

The Vice President also wanted the urban-rural gap in providing modern healthcare facilities to be bridged and urged the private sector to supplement the efforts of the governments in catering to the rural population. Pointing out that hospitals in rural areas were facing shortage in terms of infrastructure and human resource, he suggested a mandatory rural service for young doctors after passing out of the college. 

The Chairman of Swarna Bharat Trust, Dr. Kamineni Srinivas, the Executive Director of Punjab National Bank, Shri Linganeni Prabhakar, the Chairman of Care Hospital, Dr. B. Somaraju, the Treasurer, Trust Board, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital & Research Institute, Shri J.S.R. Prasad and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asserted that the nation could not accelerate its progress unless women were involved as equal stakeholders in every sphere of activity. He urged the governments at State and the Centre, NGOs and civic society at large to collectively work towards educating women on financial management.

Addressing the National Conclave on Women’s Empowerment Through Financial Literacy organized by the Learning Links Foundation in association with the Vodafone India Foundation, in Hyderabad today, the Vice President called for greater thrust on empowering women through financial literacy. ‘Making women equal partners in progress must begin by making them independent and empower them to deal with finances,’ he added.

Shri Naidu said that fastest growing economy like India which was projected by IMF to grow at 7.3 per cent this fiscal and 7.5 per cent in 2020 and is poised to become a US $ 5 trillion economy in next five years, must make women equal partners in that process by creating an enabling framework. 'We must realize that one cannot change social dynamics without women’s involvement in the economy,' he added.

Stressing the need for improving women’s understanding of financial rights, responsibilities and opportunities for income generation, the Vice President said that this was particularly important for a country like India which is witnessing a rapid economic and social transformation. He observed that educating women and girls about financial services, instilling the discipline of financial investment in them early would not only make them run households better, but would also help bring a turnaround in the fortunes of our country.

Pointing out that gender equality must be the concern of every citizen and not just women alone, Shri Naidu said that empowering women through financial literacy would not only help in bridging the gender gap but would also ensure more secure future for women. At the same time, it was equally important to impart training and skills to women for economic empowerment.

Observing that financially literate women ensure greater financial stability through investments and savings, Shri Naidu stressed the need to train rural women in the use of digital technology to promote and sell their products as also to ensure proper investment of their earnings.

The Vice President said that financial inclusion was one of the most effective accelerators of economic participation by women and called for efforts to generate or create programs and modules to increase financial literacy among women. He also complimented the Jaadu Ginni Ka campaign, a financial literacy initiative in India working in 15 states.

The Chairperson of Learning Links Foundation, Dr. Anjlee Prakash, the Managing Director of Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas, Government of Andhra Pradesh, Shri P. Chinna Thataiah, the Director of Vodafone India Foundation, Shri P. Balaji and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to inaugurate this national conference on women empowerment through financial literacy organised by Learning Links Foundation.

One of India’s greatest strategists and economic thinkers, Chanakya,  who wrote ‘Arthashastra’ says that artha (finance) is the most important quality and discipline required for any society and that both dharma and karma are dependent on it. He said wealth creation was essential for establishing a welfare State.

Friends, India is the second largest nation in the world in terms of population and home to 17.5% of the world’s population. In fact, almost half of India’s population comprises women and about 65 per cent of the people are below the age of 35 years.

As you all are aware, India is the fastest growing economy in the world today and the latest report of IMF has projected Indian economy to grow at 7.3 per cent this fiscal and 7.5 per cent in 2020. We are THE sixth largest economy in the world and are poised to become a US $ 5 Trillion economy in next five years.

With India emerging as a top destination for investments and the country set to become a US $ 10 Trillion economy in the next 10-15 years, women empowerment through financial literacy acquires greater importance and must be accorded highest priority. This can only be done when government, NGOs like Learning foundation, civic society collectively work towards it.

I am told that Learing Links foundation with the support of various central and state government schemes, is implementing several programs that aim at empowering people.

I appreciate the “Jaadu Ginni ka” program which engages self-help groups and other women associations across states for taking financial literacy to the base of the pyramid.

I am told that “Jaadu Ginni ka” program is being implemented with the support of Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas (MEPMA), Govt. of Andhra Pradesh, State rural livelihood mission across Rajasthan, Odisha, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Navy Wives welfare association (NWWA).

We cannot accelerate progress unless women are involved as equal stakeholders in every sphere of activity, including agriculture. Let me recall the words of the Father of the Constitution, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar,  who had said: “I measure the progress of a community by the degree of the progress which women have achieved”.

Ensuring access to quality and affordable education is highly crucial in empowering women and laying a strong foundation for a literate society. No doubt, we have made substantial progress on this front but ensuring a 100 per cent literate population is a long and arduous task and we must leave no stone unturned in achieving that goal.

Dear sisters and brothers,

Making women equal partners in progress must begin by making them independent and empower them to deal with finances. We must realize that one cannot change social dynamics without women’s involvement in the economy.

It should be noted that participation of the women in the economy will not only help in their own wellbeing but also contributes to the overall economic growth of the country.

There is a need to improve their understanding of financial rights, responsibilities and opportunities for income generation. This is particularly important for a country like India which is witnessing a rapid economic and social transformation.

I am happy that in recent years, we have seen an upward trend in women’s participation in decision making and entrepreneurship but we are yet to witness a considerable participation.

Educating women and girls about financial services, instilling the value of investment and the discipline of financial investing in them early would not only make them run households better, but would also help bring a turnaround in the fortunes of our country.

Empowering women through financial literacy is not only important in terms of bridging the gender gap but also to ensure a more secure future for women. Gender equality must be the concern of every citizen and not just the women alone.

By setting ‘gender equality’ as a standalone Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), the United Nations has recognized the economic and social imperative of closing the gap. As a matter of fact, without achieving gender equality, most of the sustainable goals may not be achieved to their full purpose.

All of us understand the fact that financial inclusion is one of the most effective accelerators of economic participation by women and hence we all must make efforts to generate or create programs and modules to increase financial literacy among women.

Women can play a major role in ensuring financial stability, particularly at the micro-level in running the household affairs. Financially literate women can promote investments and savings.

As a matter-of-fact, financial literacy provides impetus to financial planning and enhances an individual’s ability to be an efficient manager of his/her financial resources and ensure economic security to the family. It allows an individual to make informed and effective decisions.

Imparting financial literacy and skills would enable women to effectively manage their personal and household finances.

Our experience with women Self Help Groups (SHGs) operating out of various villages and rural habitats not only gives us hope but also creates confidence in the inherent entrepreneurial skill among the women of the country.

Over the past two decades, they have been transforming the lives of millions of women. They not only help women to enter into formal financial sector and through that they achieve social and economic empowerment

The same example can be repeated in the urban and semi urban areas by providing financial assistance to women’s groups through MUDRA and other schemes.  Sectors such as textiles, tailoring, crafts that have women as majority of their work force can avail such opportunities.

Economic empowerment through microfinance is core to empowerment of rural women. Kudumbashree is one such attempt that provides its members sustainable employment and helps them earn livelihood through their traditional skills and native crafts.

For all such objectives to see the light of the day and see people benefit out of them, a definitive change must come in people’s attitude. The time has arrived to ensure that women are not only equal but bigger contributors to the growth story of India.

Early exposure to financial knowledge and various financial tools would enable youngsters to make sound and responsible financial decisions as they plan their careers. It will make them to judiciously use technology for their financial planning and management. In fact, financial education should become an important component of school syllabi.

With digital transactions becoming increasingly commonplace, there is a need to not only educate people on how to use them effectively, but also make them aware of the financial frauds connected with such transactions as lack of sufficient knowledge could make them lose hard-earned money. Besides, financial illiteracy could also lead to financial risk behaviour.

I am happy to learn that government as well as private players have come forward to join hands to make India a financially literate and financial inclusive country.

As you all are aware, technology is gender neutral. Today, the fast changing technology is opening up new vistas and avenues for women professionals and entrepreneurs to excel in their professions. We are promoting innovations and start ups by young entrepreneurs. India is second largest global hub of Start ups.

Women entrepreneurs need to fully utilize various opportunities available to them under different schemes such as MUDRA, Stand Up and Start Up to enhance income-generating activities.

While it is quite encouraging to see that women are at par with men in many fields, they are still lagging behind when it comes to financial decision-making as they are still dependent on male members of their families. This situation needs to change and both men and women need to be sufficiently financially literate to take active part in the economy and make appropriate financial decisions.

With these words, I convey my best wishes to the mission of creating a financially literate nation.

 

Jai Hind!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the life of Bhagwan Mahaveer and the philosophy of Jainism hold many crucial lessons for contemporary world.

Addressing the gathering during the Bhagwan Mahaveer Janam Kalyanak Mahotsav organized by the Jain Seva Sangh on Mahaveer Jayanti, in Hyderabad today, the Vice President said that some of the answers to the serious questions of our times could be found in the philosophy, principles and teachings of Lord Mahaveer.

The Vice President said that Bhagwan Mahaveer’s messages of non-violence, truth and universal compassion illuminated a path of righteousness and honesty. He said that the spiritual radiance and moral splendour of Bhagawan Mahaveer’s teachings would keep inspiring everyone to strive for peace, harmony and progress for all humanity. He also said that Bhagwan Mahaveer was one of the most illustrious and celebrated spiritual teachers to have walked on this earth.

Shri Naidu said that Jainism has contributed greatly to the spiritual development of India and has helped fortify India’s unwavering commitment to the ideals of truth, non-violence and peace.

Referring to India’s glorious ancient civilization, the Vice President said that India was a leader to the world in many aspects. India was the cultural capital of the world, the seat of the highest human values of love, peace, tolerance and brotherhood and the source of profound knowledge and wisdom, the Vishwaguru to the world, he said. We have to reclaim our rightful position of leadership in the world, he added.

Stating that we are living in tumultuous times, Shri Naidu said that the world was fighting violence in several forms from terrorism, insurgency and civil wars on one hand and the consequences of unchecked exploitation of resources and unbalanced and poorly planned developmental actions on the other. “We have to either change the way we live or prepare to face the inevitable consequences of our actions”, he cautioned.

The Vice President said that some people were indulging in the terrorism to weaken the social fabric of the country and the world. He wanted all countries to unitedly fight against the menace of terrorism. He urged people to propagate and practice peace as it was a prerequisite for progress. Peaceful coexistence is the need of the hour, he added.  

Pointing out that we are simply the trustees of whatever we have inherited in terms of social order and natural resources, the Vice President said “It is our sacred duty to hand them over to our posterity in the best of conditions so that continuity of life is not interrupted”. 

Shri Naidu called upon people to strive to attain peace and spare no efforts to suffuse harmony into their relationship with nature. Expressing concern over the degradation of natural resources, he said “We must cease the reckless exploitation of the abundant resources of nature and exercise restraint in the way we live”. He said it was time for people to introspect and have a re-look into ancient values and identify the best of them to find solutions to the pressing issues.

Saying that Indian philosophy always believed in harmonious living with nature, the Vice President said that one must go back to roots and learn to love and live with nature. 

The President of Shri Jain Seva Sangh, Shri Vinok Kimtee, the General Secretary of Shri Jain Seva Sangh, Shri Yogesh Singhi, the Chief Convenor of Bhagwan Mahaveer Janam Kalyanak Mahotsav, Shri Ashok Bermecha, the Convenor & Coordinator of Shri Jain Seva Sangh, Shri Praveen Pandya and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:


""मुझे हर्ष है कि मुझे श्री जैन सेवा संघ द्वारा आयोजित भगवान महावीर जन्म कल्याणक महोत्सव में सम्मिलित होने का अवसर प्राप्त हुआ है। मुझे यह जान कर खुशी है कि श्री जैन सेवा संघ 1960 से आंध्र प्रदेश और तेलंगाना राज्यों में रह रहे सभी जैन पंथों/संप्रदायों का सबसे बड़ा संगठन है। यह सचमुच हर्ष का विषय है कि यह संगठन गत 60 वर्षों से लगातार प्रतिवर्ष भगवान महावीर जन्म कल्याणक महोत्सव का आयोजन कर रहा है।

मुझे यह जान कर प्रसन्नता है कि आज इस शुभ अवसर पर अनेक जैन आचार्य, साधु, साध्वी, तपस्वी, दीक्षार्थी तथा विभिन्न स्थानों से आये अनेक गणमान्य अतिथि उपस्थित हैं। इस पुनीत अवसर पर मैं आप सभी को मेरी हार्दिक शुभकामनाएँ प्रेषित करता हूँ।

जैन धर्म के 24वें तथा इस युग के अंतिम तीर्थकर श्री भगवान महावीर, इस संसार में जन्में सबसे विलक्षण और तेजस्वी आध्यात्मिक गुरूओं में से थे।

    भारत-भूमि को अनेक उदार धर्मों की जननी बनने का सौभाग्य मिला है। यह इस भूमि का सौभाग्य ही था जो जैन धर्म का प्रतिपादन यहॉ हुआ। एक ऐसा धर्म जिसका मूल शांति, प्रेम, त्याग और अहिंसा के आदर्श गुणों में निहित है। भगवान वर्धमान महावीर द्वारा लगभग 500 ईसा पूर्व में स्थापित यह धर्म पिछली 25 शताब्दियों से मानव मात्र के लिये प्रेरणा का स्त्रोत रहा है।

    जैन धर्म का भारत के आध्यात्मिक उत्कर्ष में महान योगदान है। इस धर्म के उदार उपदेशों ने सत्य, अहिंसा तथा शांति के आदर्श गुणों के प्रति भारत की निष्ठा को और दृढ़ किया है।

•           బంధనాలు, కోరికలు, మానసిక వికారాలను జయించి (జినులై) ఉంటే కైవల్యం సాధ్యమనేది జైన సిద్ధాంతం. అహింస మరియు పరిత్యాగం సిద్ధాంతాలు మోక్షానికి దగ్గరి మార్గాలని భగవాన్ మహావీరుడు బోధించారు. సమస్త విశ్వంలోని ప్రతి జీవి పట్ల ప్రేమను కలిగి ఉండాలని, అందరిని సమానంగా చూడాలనే సిద్ధాంతాన్ని ఆయన ప్రబోధించారు.

•           మనుషుల్లాగానే జంతువులు, మొక్కలకు కూడా ఆత్మ ఉంటుందని, మనిషితో సమానంగా వాటి పట్ల కూడా సమభావన చూపాలని జైనధర్మం తెలియజేస్తుంది. శాంతి, భక్తి మరియు సామరస్యం కలిగి ఉండాలని, మన చుట్టూ ఉండే సహజ వనరులను జీవజాతులను రక్షించుకోవాలనే సందేశాన్ని జైనం తెలియజేస్తుంది.

•           జైన ధర్మానికి త్రిరత్నాలు ఆధార భూతమైన సూత్రాలు. సమ్యక్‌ దర్శనం (సరైన నమ్మకం), సమ్యక్‌ జ్ఞానం (సరైన వివేకం), సమ్యక్‌ జీవనం (సరైన ప్రవర్తన). ఇవే గాక సత్యం, అహింస, అపరిగ్రహం (ఇతర వస్తువుల కోసం ఆశ పడకపోవడం), అస్థేయం (దొంగతనం చేయకపోవడం), బ్రహ్మచర్యం అనే ఐదు మార్గదర్శక సూత్రాలున్నాయి. వీటిని బోధిస్తూ మహావీరుడు తన జీవితాన్ని గడిపారు.

•           పరమత సహనం కలిగి ఉండమని జైనం ఉద్ఘాటించింది. నిజానికి జైనమత మూల సిద్ధాంతాల్లో “అనేకాంతవాదం” ముఖ్యమైనది. “సత్యం ఒకటే అయినా అనేక మంది, అనేక విధాలుగా దాని గురించి చెప్పగలరు. కానీ ఎవరూ పూర్తి సత్యాన్ని చెప్పలేరు. అయినప్పటికీ చెప్పే ప్రతి సత్యం వెనుక కొంత నిజం ఉంది” అనే రుగ్వేద భావనే ఈ అనేకాంత వాదం. 

Sisters and brothers,

The life of Bhagwan Mahaveer and the philosophy of Jainism hold many crucial lessons for contemporary world. 

We live in tumultuous times. On one hand the world is fighting violence in several forms, from terrorism to insurgency to civil wars and on several fronts and on the other hand we are facing the consequences of unchecked exploitation of resources and unbalanced and poorly planned developmental actions.

Friends, our civilization is doubtlessly at cross roads today. 

We have to either change the way we live or prepare to face the inevitable consequences of our actions. At this juncture, some of the answers to the pressing questions of our time can be found in the philosophy, principles and teachings of Lord Mahaveer.

It is time we undertake an introspection of what makes us Indian. We take a re-look at our ancient values, identify the best of them, the ones most suited to our times and incorporate them in our lives. 

•           భారతదేశం ఒకప్పుడు ఉన్నతమైన నాగరికతకు కేంద్రంగా విలసిల్లింది. ప్రపంచానికి దిశానిర్దేశం చేసింది. ప్రేమ, శాంతి, సహనం, సోదరభావనను ప్రవచించి ప్రపంచానికి సాంస్కృతిక రాజధానిగా శోభిల్లడమే కాదు, విజ్ఞానఖనిగా, విశ్వగురువుగా భాసిల్లింది. 

•           మన మానవతా విలువలు, ప్రాచీన విజ్ఞానాన్ని తిరిగి నిలబెట్టుకుని ప్రపంచానికి నాయకత్వం వహించే మన స్థానాన్ని పదిలం చేసుకునే దిశగా ప్రతి భారతీయుడు ముందుకు సాగడం తక్షణ కర్తవ్యం. ఈ లక్ష్యాన్ని సాధించడంలో జైన మత సిద్ధాంతాలు, సూత్రాలు మనకు మార్గదర్శనం చేస్తాయి.

•           ప్రకృతి మనకు ప్రసాదించిన వనరుల మీద మనకు హక్కు కంటే బాధ్యత ఎక్కువ ఉంటుంది. మన ముందు తరాలకు వాటిని అదే విధంగా అందించాల్సిన ధర్మకర్తల్లాంటి బాధ్యత మనందరిది. ఈ భూమికి, ఇక్కడ ఉండే జీవజాలానికి ఏ విధమైన హానీ చేయకుండా, ఈ సమస్తవిశ్వాన్ని ముందు తరాలకు యధావిధిగా అందించేందుకు ప్రతిన బూనాలి.

•           ఈ దిశలో మనందరం ముందుకు నడిచే విధంగా జైనం మనకు మార్గదర్శనం చేస్తుంది. శాంతి, అహింసల ద్వారా అసాధ్యాలను సుసాధ్యం చేయవచ్చని,  దేన్నైనా సాధించుకోవచ్చనే విషయాన్ని మన స్వరాజ్య సంగ్రామం గుర్తు చేస్తుంది. జైనం ప్రేరణతో అదే మార్గంలో ప్రతి ఒక్కరూ నడవాల్సిన అవసరం ఉంది.

•           ప్రకృతి మనిషికి కావలసిన వాటన్నింటినీ సమకూరుస్తుంది. అలాంటి ప్రకృతికి హాని కలిగించడమంటే కూర్చున్న కొమ్మను నరుక్కోవడమే అనే విషయాన్ని గుర్తెరిగి ముందుకు సాగాలి. ప్రకృతి వనరుల పై జరుగుతున్న నిర్లక్ష్య దోపిడీకి ఇప్పటికైనా చరమగీతం పాడాలి. దానికి అనుగుణంగా మన జీవన విధానాన్ని మార్చుకోవాలి. ప్రకృతిని ప్రేమించాలి, ప్రకృతితో కలిసి జీవించాలి.

•           భగవాన్ మహావీరుడి జయంతి అంటే కేవలం ఆయన పుట్టినరోజు మాత్రమే కాదు, శాంతియుత సహజీవనం మరియు సేవాభావాలకు ప్రతీకగా నిలిచే రోజు ఇది. 

•           సత్యం, అహింస మరియు అన్నీ జీవుల పట్ల కరుణను కలిగి ఉండాలనే మహావీరుని సందేశాలు నీతి, నిజాయితీలకు మార్గంగా ప్రకాశిస్తాయి. ఆధ్యాత్మిక విజ్ఞానం మరియు మహావీరుని బోధనలు శాంతి, సామరస్యం మరియు పురోగతి దిశగా మన జీవితాలను ముందుకు తీసుపోతాయి.

•           ఈ పవిత్రమైన మహావీరుని జయంతి సందర్భాన్ని పురస్కరించుకుని మెరుగైన ప్రపంచాన్ని నిర్మించే దిశగా ప్రతిఒక్కరం కంకణబద్ధులం కావాలని ఆకాంక్షిస్తున్నాను.

•           “సత్య మార్గంలో సహనంగా ముందుకు కదలండి” అనే మహా వీరుని ఆదర్శాలను ప్రతి ఒక్కరం మననం చేసుకుని సహనం, అంకితభావంతో సత్య మార్గంలో ప్రతి ఒక్కరూ ముందుకు నడవాలని ఆకాంక్షిస్తున్నాను.

 

भगवान महावीर जी की जयंती के अवसर पर इतना सुरूचिपूर्ण और भव्य श्रद्धांजलि उत्सव आयोजित करने के लिये , मैं श्री जैन सेवा संघ का अभिनंदन करता हूँ।

मैं प्रार्थना करता हूँ कि भगवान महावीर  की प्रेरणा हम सब में सदैव जीवंत रहे और आधुनिक जीवनशैली की भ्रांतियों और शंकाओं के बीच हमारे सभी संदेहों का निराकरण करे। हमारा मार्गदर्शन करे कि हम मानव जाति के उज्जवल भविष्य के लिये सही मार्ग चुनें।

धन्यवाद,

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the crux of the entire governance paradigm is implementation, how well is the delivery mechanism functioning. He called upon all the civil services officers to work together in unison, and said that complementing each other with their specific domain experiences would help in giving the much required momentum and direction to India’s growth story. 

Addressing the 44th batch of Advance Professional Programme in Public Administration (APPPA) programme sponsored by the Indian Institute of Public Administration, here today, the Vice President asked officers to pro-actively explore creative alternatives to the status quo and take steps to strengthen the dialogue with people and make them partners in the progress of the nation.

Pointing that implementation was the crux of the entire governance paradigm, the Vice President called for measures to build a culture of monitoring, evaluation and constant reform. ‘Even for the best of the systems, there is always a possibility to become better,’ he added. 

Quoting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the unifier of India and the creator of the Indian steel frame, the Vice President asked the officers representing Civil and Defence, technical and non-technical departments of the government to be guided by the spirit of service.

Saying that each citizen and person in country must feel that there was a perceptible improvement in the quality of life, he urged officers to adopt, adapt and scale up best practices to facilitate the common man. He also asked them to maintain professional competence and become constant learners of technology, policy and the world to serve the people better. Keep learning and absorb the best practices within and outside India, from both the private as well as the public sector, he said.

The Secretary to the Vice President, Dr. I.V. Subba Rao, the Director, IIPA, Shri S.N. Tripathi, the Programme Director (APPPA), IIPA, Prof. Ashok Vishandass and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am happy to interact with all of you today. 

I am happy that this 10-month, customized course is aimed at renewing your knowledge and sharpen your administrative skills.

Having a mix of participants from Civil and Defence, technical and non-technical brings together a rich pool of diverse experience and knowledge. 

I believe that such courses are essential to provide fresh insights and reform the administrative system.

The fast changing political, social and economic milieu of today demands a citizen-centric administration. 

The people want an efficient and responsive administration which addresses their concerns quickly in a transparent and fair manner. 

As I had said in another context, our ‘Swarajya’ will have to be translated into ‘Surajya’ or good, responsive governance.  

Implementation is the key element on which we have to focus more. 

Dear sisters and brothers, administrative reforms are a continuous process. We need to update and revamp the systems and processes in tune with the requirements. There is no room for archaic laws and procedures. This requires a fresh thinking, constant review of current practices and the courage to suggest and implement change. 

In your work situation, I am sure you will be facing new and daunting challenges. At the same time, every new situation presents you an opportunity to think innovatively and come up with out-of-the-box solutions by making optimum use of the resources. 

Better, swifter service delivery is the need of the hour. Any development agenda should aim at inclusion, reaching the unreached and funding the unfunded.

No doubt, our country’s civil services are among the best in the world. But there is always room for improvement.

As Shri Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the unifier of India and the creator of the Indian steel frame had said, you should be guided by the spirit of service. Add to this, the elements of professional competence and constant learning. 

Civil servants should absorb new information and knowledge, adapt to a rapidly changing socio-political environment and address the key challenges in contemporary society. 

You need to be forward looking. 

You should pro-actively explore creative alternatives to the status quo. 

What we need to do today is to strengthen the dialogue with people and making people partners in the progress of the nation. 

I urge you to keep learning and absorb the best practices within and outside India, from both the private as well as the public sector. You should adopt, adapt and scale up best practices. 

The ultimate bottom line is: Each citizen and each person in this country must feel that there is a perceptible improvement in the quality of life.

You come from various walks of life working in different Services but you represent really the public services as such, the services which are intended to serve the public. 

All the civil services officers need to work together in unison, complementing and supporting each other with their specific domain experiences and expertise so that India’s growth story gets the much required momentum and direction.

The crux of the entire governance paradigm is implementation, how well is the delivery mechanism functioning. 

We have to build that culture of monitoring, evaluation and constant reform.

Even for the best of the systems, there is always a possibility to become better. 

I expect each one of you to be managerial leaders upgrading our governance systems on a continuous basis towards higher levels of proficiency and efficiency.

I wish you all the very best. 

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon town planners to make sustainable solutions such as harvesting solar energy, enhancing green cover and water conservation an essential part of town planning.

 

Shri Naidu, while addressing the 4th Resilient Cities Asia-Pacific (RCAP) Congress 2019 organized by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI). Here today, asked municipal administrators to accord priority to tree plantation, solid waste management, protection and rejuvenation of water bodies.

 

Observing that a massive migration from rural to urban areas has become a reality, the Vice President said that education, entertainment, enhanced medical facilities and employment were the main drivers of such migration. He asked for collaborative efforts of governments at state and centre to reduce the divide by providing urban amenities in rural areas.

 

Opining that economic growth must take environmental protection into consideration, Shri Naidu observed that dependency on fossil fuel must be reduced and new forms of energy sources such as solar must be explored.  ‘It cannot be business as usual as far as development is concerned,’ he added

 

The Vice President called upon all the representatives of provinces and cities of various countries presented to adopt multi-dimensional and innovative approaches to ensure low emissions oriented development. He urged them to promote public transport in cities to reduce congestion and air pollution. 

 

Observing the green infrastructure was the need of the hour, he stressed the need to promote resource efficiency to achieve climate resilient urban development. Moving away from traditional metrics of measuring development, Shri Naidu called for new urban infrastructure that was low-carbon, green and climate resilient. He also called for measures to ensure that urban solid waste is converted wealth by learning from the best practices followed globally.

 

Saying that one must draw inspiration from our cultural roots, especially the civilizational values that revered and urged us to protect natural resources, the Vice President said that adopting green solutions, providing good governance and building urban resilience was the way forward.

 

Observing that rise in global temperature was going to result in several aspects of human activity including farming, Shri Naidu wanted planners to factor in changing climate and its likely impacts in all development strategies. He called for up-scaling climate mitigation measures to reduce climate-related risks in the future.

 

Pointing that more than 60% of the world’s population resides in Asia and the region was most affected by natural disasters, the Vice President said that governments in Asia must build climate resilient habitats. He further said that Asian cities must emphasize biodiversity and healthy, functioning ecosystems. With pollution reaching hazardous levels in cities, utmost priority needs to be accorded to promote clean and green technologies, he added.

 

The 4th Resilient Cities Asia-Pacific (RCAP) Congress 2019 organized by the organized by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) in association with South Delhi Municipal Corporation witnessed the presence of more than 200 delegates from around 30 countries.   

 

The Chargé d'affaires, Embassy of Switzerland in India, Ms. Tamara Mona, the Deputy Head of Delegation of the European Union to India and Bhutan, Mr. Raimund Magis, the Deputy Secretary General of ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, Shri Emani Kumar, the Commissioner, South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Shri Puneet Kumar Goel, Town planners, Mayors from countries such as Bhutan, Japan, Switzerland, Malaysia, Nepal, Mongolia, Vietnam, European Union, China and other dignitaries were present at the venue. 

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 


“It is my pleasure to address this august gathering of leaders from several cities, practitioners, policy makers and researchers from Asia and other parts of the globe.

I extend a hearty warm welcome to you all to India –a country which has traditionally looked upon every creature as a friend. As the ancient Indian text, Rigveda, had said, 

“Mitrasyaham Chakshusha Sarvani Bhutani Sameekshe Mitrasya Chakshusha Smeeksha Mahe”

“Look at every entity of Nature with the eyes of a friend. May we look upon one another with the eye of a friend”.

I understand that we are gathered here today to deliberate on the most important challenge confronting all of us. That is the challenge of climate change.

I hope your discussions will lead to a better understanding of this challenge and illuminate the alternative pathways for collective action. 

The impact of climate change is especially relevant to our cities and towns in Asia. Floods, cyclones, wild fires and hurricanes continue to disrupt life on an almost regular basis.

Temperatures are rising and a drought like situation is gripping cities in the summer with water scarcity being a regular challenge. Our cities are battling the consequences of climate change on a daily basis.

India, I must proudly say, is now one of the global leaders in addressing this challenge head-on. As recently announced at the 24th Conference of Parties on Climate Change, in Katowice, Poland, our country is well on its way to achieve our stated Nationally Determined Contributions.

Economic growth should take environmental protection into consideration. The dependence on fossil fuel must be reduced.

India has defined an ambitious target of deploying 175GW of renewable power by 2022. This target is now further raised to 227 GW of renewable energy capacity, considering that we are well on our way to exceeding the previously set target.

Dear sisters and brothers, it should be noted that climate vulnerability and likely impacts should be factored in all development strategies. 

Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. Globally, if we continue with our current development trajectory, we are certain to breach the 1.5 o c target in the coming 30 years. 

This increase in global temperature is likely to result in an increase in mean temperature over most land and ocean regions, hot extremes in most inhabited regions, heavy precipitation in several regions and the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions. Future climate-related risks can be reduced by up-scaling climate mitigation measures.

Dear sisters and brothers, more than 60% of the world’s population resides in Asia. Nearly half of this population resides in cities and towns. It is the region that is most affected by natural disasters. In the light of these realities, the governments in Asia should build climate resilient communities

According to the United Nations, “hundreds of millions of people will be vulnerable to coastal flooding and related natural disasters as global warming increases. Moreover, it will be the poorest countries and people who will be most vulnerable to this threat and who will suffer the earliest and the most”. Poor adaptive capacities will disrupt energy supply, mobility, economy, health and our lives in general.

It is extremely crucial to link every aspect of urbanization with sustainability. Cities account for two-thirds of global energy demand and 70% of carbon emissions. With urbanization expected to reach 67% globally by 2050, cities will be the centers of economic growth and likely to contribute 80% of global GDP. As such, cities need to take the lead for transition to a low-carbon economy, particularly in emerging economies in Asia.

We need to change our development paradigm and aim for climate resilient development, moving away from traditional metrics of measuring development. The new urban infrastructure should be low-carbon, green and climate resilient.

We are running out of time and we need innovative solutions that will help the cities to achieve the hitherto elusive trio of development, sustainability and climate resilience. 

I call upon all the city, province and country representatives present here to adopt various multi-dimensional and innovative approaches, as a part of their endeavour to achieve the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development, to ensure low emissions oriented development. The need of the hour is to encourage green infrastructure, enable a circular economy and promote resource efficiency to achieve climate resilient urban development.

The cities must enhance access to basic services and adequate housing and focus on redesigning cities to reduce air pollution, congestion, traffic accidents and better management of waste, investment in smart infrastructure for public transport, clean energy as well as on creating green and blue public spaces. 

Asian cities must emphasize biodiversity and healthy, functioning ecosystems. With pollution reaching hazardous levels in cities, utmost priority needs to be accorded to promote clean and green technologies. The city administrations should focus on protecting local water bodies and take steps for conserving scarce water resources.

Accent should be on incentivizing e-Mobility and public transportation. 

Dear sisters and brothers,

I am aware that cities face a major constraint in terms of accessing finance considering the current scale of urbanization and future trends. Enabling public private partnerships, involving local banking institutions, blended finance models, municipal bonds and green bonds are all effective means towards enhancing access to finance.

The challenge before us huge. It is a challenge that will get only more formidable with each passing day. Time is of the essence. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) summary to policymakers released in October 2018 indicates that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have to be reduced by 45% before 2030. 

It is a challenging mission but not an impossible one. A recent report estimates that implementing circular economy globally makes the Paris Agreement target achievable.

Circular economy strategies, like increasing the share of renewables in a country’s energy mix, improving energy efficiency are required.

Dear sisters and brothers, we all have an onerous responsibility in making sustainable development our core agenda and transforming the planet so that the future of our posterity is not jeopardized in any manner. 

To ensure a brighter future for all our citizens, especially those living in urban centres, we must also focus on reducing the rural-urban divide and involve all people as agents of change. 

At the same time, we should recognize the perils of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption. 

As Mahatma Gandhi had said many years ago: “The earth has enough resources for our need, but not for our greed."" We should promote a lifestyle that takes sustainability and environmental integrity as key factors. 

We must draw inspiration from our cultural roots, especially the civilizational values that revered and urged us to protect natural resources. As the ancient Indian sages had said in the Rig Veda: ""Do Not Harm The Environment; Do Not Harm The Water And The Flora; Earth Is My Mother, I Am Her Son; May The Waters Remain Fresh, Do Not Harm The Waters”.

It cannot be business as usual as far as development is concerned. We must strive to adopt green solutions, provide good governance and build urban resilience. We must collectively get together by forging meaningful public-private partnerships for advancing on our agenda. 

I hope the forum generates new ideas for catalyzing progress in the Asia Pacific region. I look forward to learning about some of the takeaways from this conference.


JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today visited Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar and paid tributes to martyrs on the 100th anniversary of one of the goriest episodes in human history and the darkest chapter of the British rule in India, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The commemoration ceremony to pay homage to the martyrs was organized by the Ministry of culture, Government of India. 

Shri Naidu paid his respects to the fallen heroes by placing a wreath upon the memorial. He released a commemorative coin and a postage stamp to mark the 100th anniversary of Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The Vice President was also appraised of the proposed works for the revitalization of the memorial. 

Shri Naidu tweeted that Jallianwala Bagh was a reminder to each one of us as to how hard won & precious our freedom is. He said that it was an occasion to shed a silent tear for each of the innocent Indians who lost their lives that Baisakhi day in 1919 and a poignant moment of reflection on colonial cruelty & irrational anger.

The Vice President said through social media that the pain and agony continue to rankle in the hearts of every Indian to this day even though 100 years have lapsed since that inhuman massacre happened. ‘History is not a mere chronicle of events. It shows us the depths to which depraved minds can plunge and cautions us to learn from the past. It also tells us that the power of evil is transient.’, he said.

Shri Naidu called on his fellowmen to draw lessons from history and work to shape a better future for the humanity. He spoke about the need for the world community to come together to promote everlasting peace in all the corners of the globe and ensure that sustainable development of the planet becomes the watchword at all times and at all levels from schools to summits of global leaders. 

‘Progress cannot be achieved without peace’, he affirmed and called upon world nations to establish a New and Equitable World Order where the power and responsibilities are shared, opinions and voices are respected and wealth and earth’s resources are shared. 

‘This is a day that reminds us of the indomitable human spirit that braves the fury of fusillade of bullets and ultimately keeps the flag of freedom and peace high. It is a timely reminder to each one of us as to how hard won and precious is our freedom. Today is an occasion to shed a silent tear for each of the innocent Indians who lost their lives that Baisakhi day in 1919’, he said.

Shri Naidu expressed hope that this day would inspires us to strive to create a world without oppression & persecution, a world of friendship, peace & progress, a world where all nations stand united to defeat inhuman forces of terror & violence. 

‘It is a day to reaffirm India's centuries long commitment to the ideal of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, he proclaimed. 

The Vice President also visited a Photo Exhibition at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar put up by the Regional Outreach Bureau, Bureau of Outreach and Communication, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India. The exhibition comprised of 45 panels dedicated to the Jallianwala Bagh incident, including excerpts from the newspapers of the time, letters of Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindra Nath Tagore and other prominent leaders. The Exhibition also showcases the important milestones of the freedom struggle. 

The Governor of Punjab, Shri V.P. Singh Badnore, the Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Government of India, Shri Arun Goel and senior officials of the central and state government were present on the occasion.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that financial inclusion and inclusive development are the needs of the hour. He called for ‘Antyodaya’ and stated that development held no meaning until its benefits reached the most deprived groups of people. He was addressing the gathering at the celebration of the 125th Foundation Day of the Punjab National Bank (PNB), here today.

The Vice President paid rich tributes to Shri Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the most prominent and inspirational leaders of India’s struggle for independence and felicitated the members of his family.

Shri Naidu called for systemic reforms in the Indian banking sector in light of mounting Non Performing Assets (NPAs). He spoke of the need to have an effective and efficient system of checks and balances in place so that the loop holes in the system are not taken advantage of.

The Vice President said that India’s financial institutions have been commended globally for being resilient and for having withstood global downturns and recessions well. He opined that banks were no longer just about strong lockers and a good interest rate on deposits. ‘They have transcended their conventional mandates and are now at the forefront of India's development story’, he added.

Saying that banks played a central role in India’s quest for financial inclusion and inclusive growth, he expressed his firm belief that India’s banking sector was poised for robust growth as the rapidly growing business and commerce in India would turn to banks for credit and other financial services. He cited a number of factors such as the upwardly mobile middle class and the digital revolution as the thrust factors behind these growth prospects.

Citing the gains made by India in digital technologies for banking such as India’s Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), RuPay and the Unified Payment Interface (UPI), and the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), a mobile app based on UPI, the Vice President asked banks to further harness digital growth to scale up to the level of world-class businesses. He also spoke about new and innovative business models such as the Payment banks and small finance banks.

The Vice President pointed towards a number of challenges being faced by the banking industry such as the rising Non Performing Assets in the banking system that has the capacity to affect banks’ lending capabilities. He said that the accumulation of bad loans happened over a long period of time, and now, it threatens to hamper economic growth by weakening the credit supply channel of the economy.

Shri Naidu instructed banks to maintain strict vigilance during pre- and post-sanction procedures of loans and told them to never make compromises in the due diligence processes. ‘Banks must constantly strengthen their internal processes to effectively monitor funds and maintain strict discipline in lending’, he added.

The Vice President suggested that banks can make use of technology and data analytics to identify the early warning signals of loan defaulting and evolve robust mechanisms to identify the hidden NPAs. He said that banks must focus on nurturing internal skills for credit assessment and undertake forensic audits to understand the intent of the borrower.

Expressing concern about the increasing cases of wilful defaults and frauds that have recently been in the news, Shri Naidu said that no efforts in bringing these individuals and entities to speedy and exemplary justice. He opined that India must enter into more treaties for exchange of information and intelligence on financial fraud and bank accounts and work with international agencies in bringing defaulters to justice. He questioned the need for existence of tax havens and said that India must enter into many more strong extradition treaties.

The Vice President also asked banks to adhere strictly to the principles of business ethics and good corporate governance at all times. Observing that a bankers' role was one of stewardship based on trust, he cautioned that banks have a duty to lend customers’ money responsibly.

‘Ethical considerations should form an important part of risk-taking activities. The welfare of customers and other stakeholders in good times and bad should be a major concern in any business proposition’, the Vice President said quoting Mahatma Gandhi who said that “Commerce without morality” was one of the seven deadly sins.

Saying that this was a period of disruptions in the banking sector caused due to factors ranging from technology to innovative new business models, he urged banks to make bold moves and initiate major transformations to take advantage of them.

The Chairman, Punjab National Bank, Shri Sunil Mehta, the MD and CEO, Punjab National Bank, Shri Ashok Pal Singh, the Member (Planning and HRD), Postal Services Board and other dignitaries were present at the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It gives me immense pleasure to be with you today on this historic occasion of the 125th Foundation Day of Punjab National Bank, an institution of distinguished heritage. It is heartening to note several milestones achieved by the bank as it confidently steps into the 125th year of its illustrious existence.

This remarkable journey is a living testimony of this institution’s indomitable spirit and commitment.

I understand that PNB’s journey began on 12 April, 1895 in Lahore, undivided India, as a culmination of the painstaking and enterprising efforts of its visionary founders, including the doyen of Indian freedom struggle, Lala Lajpat Rai, the Lion of Punjab.

These passionate nationalists established a Swadeshi bank, run professionally with Indian capital and management, to meet the financial needs and aspirations of their fellow Indians. It is heartening to note that this connect to the freedom struggle of the country is a source of abiding strength, pride and inspiration to the Bank.

I am happy to note that through all these years, even in the most testing of times, the Bank has won and retained the trust of all its Stakeholders - Customers, Employees, Shareholders, the Regulatory bodies and the Government. 

It is heartening to note that combining business acumen with a tenacity of purpose and professionalism has taken PNB from its early humble origins to its present stature. It is a performance that has earned it a position of leadership, respect and pre-eminence in our banking industry.

I am happy to know that the bank has more than 6900 branches, the second largest number among public sector banks.

PNB’s saga brings to the fore what human enterprise and initiative can achieve in bringing about a lasting growth and development in the lives of the people of our country and indeed in the progress of our nation.

My dear sisters and brothers,

India’s financial institutions have been commended globally for being resilient and for having withstood global downturns and recessions well.

Banks are no longer just about strong lockers and a good interest rate on deposits. They have transcended their conventional mandates and are now at the forefront of India's development story.

In addition to fuelling dreams of Indian industry and entrepreneurs, banks are leading India’s quest for inclusive growth.

Financial inclusion and provision of banking services to the last mile is now the central theme of India’s banking expansion drive.

The banking system of India is a vast network consisting of 27 public sector banks, 21 private sector banks, 49 foreign banks, 56 regional rural banks, more than 1500 urban cooperative banks and close to 1 lakh rural cooperative banks, in addition to cooperative credit institutions.

In FY07-18, total lending marked a Comprehensive Average Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.94 per cent and total deposits increased at a CAGR of 11.66 per cent. 

It is indeed noteworthy that India’s retail credit market is the fourth largest in the emerging countries. It increased to US$ 281 billion on December 2017 from US$ 181 billion on December 2014.

India has one of the most evolved digital payments systems with India’s Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) being the only system at level 5 in the Faster Payments Innovation Index (FPII).

As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India’s banking sector is sufficiently capitalised and well-regulated.

Indian banking industry has recently witnessed the roll out of innovative banking models like payments and small finance banks.

As of September 2018, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) has been launched and has opened branches across 650 districts.

I firmly believe that that India’s banking sector is poised for robust growth as the rapidly growing business and commerce in India would turn to banks for credit and other financial services.

A number of positive trends would fuel the growth of the banking sector in the future.  .

The expansion and upward mobility of the middle class have transformed retail banking in India over the past decade. 89 million more households are set to join this social segment by 2025.

India is also witnessing a digital revolution. The falling cost of Internet access has facilitated the adoption of a number of paradigm shifting digital technologies and innovations. 

The digital revolution has led to the creation of a number of low-cost Indian platforms to promote digital payments such as RuPay, a cheaper, domestic alternative to international credit or debit card gateways such as MasterCard and Visa. 

The Unified Payment Interface (UPI), and the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), a mobile app based on UPI has driven a number of financial transactions online due to their ease of access and use. 

Banks have to focus upon providing new and improved services to their clients and upgrading their technology infrastructure, in order to enhance the customer’s overall experience and gain a competitive advantage. 

They also have to harness digital growth to scale up to the level of world-class businesses.

However, the banking sector continues to be plagued by a number of challenges. 

The rising Non Performing Assets in the banking system is a cause for great concern. Mounting NPAs would certainly affect banks’ capacity to lend. 

In the last few years, gross NPAs of banks as a percentage of total loans have increased from nearly 2 % of total loans in 2008 to nearly 10% in 2017.

The accumulation of bad loans happened over a long period of time, and now, it threatens to hamper economic growth by weakening the credit supply channel of the economy.

Some of the factors leading to the increased occurrence of NPAs are external, such as decreases in global commodity prices leading to slower exports. 

Some are more intrinsic to the Indian banking sector.

Our banks will need to maintain strict vigilance during pre- and post-sanction procedures of loans and never make compromises in the due diligence processes. They must constantly strengthen their internal processes to effectively monitor funds and maintain strict discipline in lending.

Time has come for a systemic reform of the Indian banking sector. There has to be an effective and efficient system of checks and balances in place so that the loop holes in the system are not taken advantage of. 

We must also take a re-look at the practice of financing big-ticket projects which have long gestation periods and hence face cash flow issues, through deposit-taking commercial banks.

Banks can make use of technology and data analytics to identify the early warning signals of loan defaulting and evolve robust mechanisms to identify the hidden NPAs. They must focus on nurturing internal skills for credit assessment and undertake forensic audits to understand the intent of the borrower.

Increasing cases of willful defaults and frauds have recently been in the news.  We must spare no effort in bringing these individuals and entities to speedy and exemplary justice. 

India must enter into more treaties for exchange of information and intelligence on financial fraud and work with international agencies in bringing defaulters to justice.

Banks must also at all times adhere strictly to the principles of business ethics and good corporate governance. A bankers' role is one of stewardship based on trust. Customers trust banks to safeguard and manage their money and banks have a duty to lend that money responsibly. 

Ethical considerations should form an important part of risk-taking activities. The welfare of customers and other stakeholders in good times and bad should be a major concern in any business proposition. 

Let me remind you that Mahatma Gandhi regarded “Commerce without morality” as one of the seven deadly sins.

My dear sisters and brothers,

This is a period of disruptions in the banking sector caused due to factors ranging from technology to innovative new business models. These disruptions present tremendous growth opportunities. I believe that banks, especially legacy ones, will need to make bold moves and initiate major transformations to take advantage of them. 

I am sure that India’s banking sector will move forward and become more professionally advanced and responsive in the next few years. 

Let me once again congratulate Punjab National Bank on this momentous occasion.

The success of an enterprise of this scale, magnitude and vision is a testimony to the skills, synergies and dedication of all the human resources associated with it. I felicitate the top management for providing able leadership and direction to the bank.

I compliment every employee of the bank for maintaining high standards of professional excellence.

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Vote is a pious responsibility and everyone should exercise it to improve quality of the polity, strengthen democracy and build glorious future for individuals and nation. In a message, he said that one should not let the moment pass: Pause and ponder, assess and act.

Following is the text of Vice President’s message:

“Tomorrow is the beginning of the largest democratic election in the world in which, over the next five weeks nearly 90 crore voters will exercise their franchise in about 10 lakh polling stations across the country to elect their representatives to the Parliament and a few State Legislatures.

India can legitimately be proud of the fact that it adopted universal adult suffrage right from the founding of the Republic in 1950. As Shri Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyar, Member of the Constituent Assembly said, “More than any other provision in the Constitution, I should think the boldest step taken by this Assembly is in the matter of universal adult suffrage with a belief in the common man and his power to shape the future of the country”.

That is the faith our Constitution makers reposed in each one of us.  It is that trust in the wisdom of the people and their ability to shape the future of our country that drives our electoral processes.

Over the last seventy years, more and more people have participated in elections. While there were about 17 crore voters in 1951, the number increased to 83 crore in 2014. While the voter turnout in the 1951 elections was 44.8% it was 66.3% in 2014. Even though this reflects a significant improvement, more voters must participate in the electoral process. Voter turnout must be enhanced. There are 465 political parties today as compared to only 53 in 1951. Clearly, the seeds of democracy sown in 1950 have taken root. They must be further nourished.

We are today the largest democracy in the world. We must now make it the best democracy in the world.

We, the people, have an opportunity to realize that dream.  We have to exercise the right to vote, the right to choose and the right to shape the quality of our polity.

I would urge each one of our citizens to exercise this precious right to make their opinion count and elect the representatives who have the 4 positive characteristics or 4Cs, as I call it: character, calibre, competence and conduct they wish to see in these public representatives.

Dear citizens,

This is not only your right but your responsibility to not let the moment pass. It is a moment that comes only once in five years.  It is a moment that gives you the right to “assess and assert”, as Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyayji had said.

You should examine the profile of the candidates and their past performance with a vision that is not clouded by the glitz and the glamour, the power and the pelf, the threats and inducements. You must discard those candidates whose claim to fame is only based on what I call the negative 4Cs – Cash, Caste, Community and Criminality.  You must make an informed choice.  Thanks to technology, we have quite a bit of information available to make this choice.    Sift this information, analyze it and then come to an informed decision.

Dear Citizens,

A few days from tomorrow, we shall also be celebrating the birth anniversary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the visionary Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee. He had cautioned us way back in 1948 that “however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot.”

It is, therefore, incumbent on each one of us to avoid the “bad lot” while making a choice.

I expect each one of us to pause and ponder, assess and act.

That’s the only way we can deepen and strengthen our democracy.  That’s the only way we can breathe life into our Constitution.  That’s the only way we can secure a better future for ourselves and our country.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M, Venkaiah Naidu has said that protecting the rich and vibrant culture of India was the duty of every citizen. He said that festivals such as Ugadi, Gudi Padwa, Vaishakhi, Vishu and others reflect the composite culture and rich heritage of our country.

The former Vice President, Shri M. Hamid Ansari, the former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Shri Anil Baijal and several eminent personalities from different walks of life attended ‘Ugadi Milan’ hosted by the Vice President and his wife Smt. Usha Naidu at Uparashtrapati Bhavan, here today.

Addressing the gathering, the Vice President said that the message of ‘Ugadi’ had always been about taking the joys and sorrows of life with equanimity.

Referring to Ugadi Chutney - Ugadi Pachchadi made of neem flowers, jaggery, raw mango, chillies, tamarind and salt, Shri Naidu said that it signifies the true essence of life and its journey.

‘It is a symbolic indication of the diversity of experiences that constitute human life, the mixed bag of emotions that we all experience on a day to day basis. It is a pointer to how we should sail through life, enjoying life as it unfolds and savouring the happiness as well as learning how to take the agonizing moments in our stride, he said.

Shri Naidu said Indian festivals such as the Ugadi remind people that they were all heirs of a civilization that had a universal, inclusive, integrated vision of welfare of all humanity. ‘This makes it a country with a timeless and therefore, an eternally relevant vision,’ he added.

Recital of Panchangam (Telugu New Year almanac) by Dr. Madugula Nagaphani Sharma, a scintillating Yoga performance by students of Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge and Technology, Nuzvid, Andhra Pradesh and dance a performance by troupe of Shri Raja Reddy & Smt. Radha Reddy were part of the celebrations.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“Today is a festival that has different names within India and many countries in South East Asia, but a common theme and a common flavour, a common aspiration and a common emotion.

It is a festival that marks the beginning of a new year. About a week from now, we shall have another set of New Years called variously in different parts of India as Vaishakhi, Vishu, Mesadi, Vaishakhadi, Puthandu, Pahela Baishakh, Sajibu Nongma Panba and Bahag Bihu and as Songkran in Thailand, Choul Chnam Thmey in Cambodia, Thingyan in Myanmar.

These are festivals that celebrate the change of seasons. They are joyous occasions for families to get together, to spruce up the homes, deck up in the finest new clothes and enjoy a delicious meal.

These festivals are sacred occasions for prayers, like the prayer to Lord Jhulelal as a part of Cheti Chand celebration, to Vishnu and Krishna as a part of Vishu and Bihu, to Lord Ganesh and Goddess Lakshmi in certain states and to Lord Buddha in Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar.

These festivals are a subtle but eloquent expressions of the Indian vision of life. For instance, festivities during Ugadi, Yugadi festival, Gudhi Padwa and Vishu have a special feature.

They invariably include a special dish, a chutney, variously called Ugadi Pachadi, Bevu Bella, Maangai Pachadi, Sadhya, Veppampoorasam, Mampazhappulissery that is made of neem flowers, jaggery, raw mango, chillies, tamarind and salt.

This is a blend of six tastes- sweet, bitter, tangy, hot, sour and salty.

It is a symbolic indication of the diversity of experiences that constitute human life, the mixed bag of emotions that we all experience on a day to day basis.

It is a pointer to how we should sail through life, enjoying life as it unfolds and savouring the happiness as well as learning how to take the agonizing moments in our stride.

These festivals, however, have an unmistakable sense of jubilation and certainly celebrate a sense of optimism, a hope that the new year will bring greater happiness, health and prosperity.

The bright colourful Rangolis, the resplendent Gudhi flags fluttering on the top of houses, the rhythmic beats of Bhangra dances, the Vishukkani plates of flowers, fruits, money, rice as well as a number of special sweets like Bobbatlu and Boorelu are artistic, aesthetic and culinary manifestations of a hope that the new year should be full of sweetness in which melody of music, the rhythms and cadence of dance, beauty and grace of life comes alive every minute to fill our days with  joyful moments.

It is truly remarkable that many countries in South East Asia have similar new year festivals. Songkran in Thailand and Thingyan in Myanmar derive their origin from the Sanskrit word, Sankranti. In both these countries, the celebrations are marked by water festivals somewhat like the Holi festival in India. There is therefore a certain commonality in our cultural traditions across the geographical boundaries.

As we all rejoice on this auspicious day and pray that all of us and our extended families are healthy and happy through the next year, let us remind ourselves that we are all heirs to a great civilization that had a universal, inclusive, integrated vision of welfare of all humanity.

This makes it a country with a timeless and therefore, an eternally relevant vision. I can do no better than echo our sages and say,

Om Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah

Sarve Santu Nir-Aamayaah |

Sarve Bhadraani Pashyantu

Maa Kashchid-Duhkha-Bhaag-Bhavet |

Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||

 

This is the prayer I would like all of us to remember. Let us have the courage to forge ahead and lead fulfilling lives with sound health and resolute will. Let us have the patience and resilience to tide over crises and obstacles.

मैं आशा करता हूं कि यह प्रार्थना हम सबको याद रहनी चाहिए। हम साहस और उत्साह के साथ अपने भविष्य में भी अग्रसर हों और दृढ़ संकल्प के साथ एक खुशहाल, संतुष्ट और स्वस्थ जीवन जिएं। हम में कठिनाइयों और क्षणिक विपत्तियों का सामना करने का धैर्य हो।

Let the new year bring good news to each one of us and our families. Let it usher in prosperity and happiness in our lives. Let it instil ‘Sanmati’ in each of us so that conflicts and violence are minimized, Durmuhuthams are few and far between and most of the days have many Amritha Kshan. Today we heard about the astrological overview of next year in the Panchang Shravan.  In my view, we can create a more peaceful prosperous world around us if we can transform our thinking and actions by focusing on a different Panchaang or five components: Satsankalp(Good Intentions) Sadasadvivechan(Clearly analyzing each action whether it will result in good or bad outcomes), Sadvachan(Speaking pleasantly and truthfully), Satdarshan(Seeing the positive side of things and spreading good thoughts) and Sadaachar (Implementing what is good for us and for all others ).

नूतन वर्ष हमारे और हमारे परिजनों के लिए खुशियां ले कर आए। नया वर्ष हमारे जीवन में सुख और समृद्धि लाए। हमने सन्मति जागृत हो जिस से हम मतभेद, विवाद,संघर्ष और हिंसा की संभावनाओं को कम कर सकें, हमारे जीवन में दुर्मुहुर्त कम से कम ही आएं और अधिकांश दिनों में  प्रायः अमृत क्षणों की ही अधिकता हो। आज हमने पंचांग श्रवण में आगामी वर्ष के लिए ज्योतिषीय व्याख्या  सुनी। मेरे विचार से यदि हम अपने कर्मों और विचारों को इन पांच अवयवों पर आधारित एक नए पंचांग के अनुसार परिवर्तित कर सकें तो हम अपने चतुर्दिक एक अधिक शांत और समृद्ध विश्व का निर्माण कर सकते हैं। ये पंच अवयव है -  अच्छी नियत से किया गया सत्संकल्प, हमारे किसी भी प्रयास का परिणाम अच्छा होगा या बुरा इसका सदासद्विवेचन, सत्य और शुभ वचन सद्वचन, सदैव सकारात्मक दृष्टिकोण रखना और सद्विचारों का प्रसार करना - सतदर्शन तथा सदाचार जो हमारे और सभी के लिए अभीष्ट हो।

मैं आपको और आपके परिजनों को इस आशा के साथ हार्दिक शुभकामनाएं देता हूं कि आगामी नव वर्ष  हमारे लिए अधिकाधिक उज्ज्वल रहेगा।

In advance, I would also like to convey my wishes to people in other states who are going to celebrate New Year festival in April.

पुत्तांड वाळतिकळ

बैसाखी दियां लख लख वधाइयां

बोहाग बिहुर शुभेश्शा जोनाइसु

I wish you and your families all the best and I hope that our tomorrows will continue to be bright and even brighter in the coming year.

 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has described the rise in non-communicable diseases as a “deeply disturbing trend” and called upon the medical fraternity to educate the people on the dangers of leading sedentary lifestyles. 

Addressing the Annual Meeting of the National Interventional Council (NIC) of the Cardiological Society of India at the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh today,  the Vice President quoting a 2017 report of India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said that disease burden from non-communicable diseases increased from 30 per cent to 55 per cent between 1990 and 2016, while the communicable diseases dropped from 61 per cent to 33 per cent in the same period.

Pointing out that factors such as high levels of stress, increased incidence of diabetes, blood pressure, smoking, excessive consumption of alcohol, lack of exercise and lack of proper sleep were contributing to cardiovascular diseases, he said that lifestyle modification was one of the key interventions needed to prevent premature heart attacks. 

Shri Naidu said that it had been proven beyond doubt that regular moderate intensity aerobic exercise like brisk walking, cycling, jogging, and swimming for five days a week would help in reducing the probability of heart disease. 

Observing that India stands poised to reap the biggest demographic dividend in history, he opined that a healthy and agile youth was essential to achieve its dream of inclusive and sustainable development and occupy its rightful place of leadership in the world. He stressed the need to encourage children to be physically active and be involved in sports and games right from school days to avoid NCDs. 

Referring to the growing fad for junk food among youngsters, he advised them to say no to junk food as it was causing harm to their health and in turn affecting quality of life.

Shri Naidu said that the nation must invest much of our resources in prevention and early detection of disease. He called for massive screening drives to identify risk factors for cardiovascular disease among people and take preventive measures. 

Observing that primary health centres must serve as bulwarks in our battle against cardiovascular disease, the Vice President stressed that transforming PHCs into a robust, responsive and well equipped network of institutions was important.

Mentioning that the nation has improved the penetration of healthcare services across the country, Shri Naidu said that increase in the at-birth life expectancy from around 37 years in 1951 to around 68.3 years in 2011-15 has been the most noteworthy achievement in the public health arena since Independence.

The Vice President also advised medical students to render service for at least three years in Primary Health Centres in rural areas, before taking up new assignments.

Stating that India must invest more resources in R & D, he said unimaginable advancements were being made in Medical Science. “Cutting edge research in disruptive technologies such as Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and augmented reality are altering the paradigms of medical science”, he added. 

Calling for improving our health sector in terms of quality, accessibility and affordability, the Vice President said ""Although our health care services are among the cheapest in the world, some of the life saving drugs and procedures are still beyond the reach of the common man. All the stakeholders in the health sectors need to work in synergy to health care affordable and accessible to common man"".

The Vice President said India must also stand out and serve as a model for quality, affordable healthcare for other nations to emulate.  “I have no doubt that we have the capability to achieve this goal and more”, he added 

The Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Ram Naik, the Director, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr. Rakesh Kapoor, the President (Elect), Cardiological Society of India, Dr. M.K. Das and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

मैं भारत की कार्डियोलाजी सोसायटी की नेशनल इंटरवेंशन काउंसिल की सालाना बैठक का उद्घाटन करते हुए प्रसन्नता अनुभव कर रहा हूं। लखनऊ के प्रतिष्ठित SGPGIMS में 5 से 7 अप्रैल, 2019 तक चलने वाली यह बैठक कार्डियोलाजी सोसायटी आफ इंडिया के उत्तर प्रदेश प्रभाग द्वारा आयोजित की जा रही है।

मुझे यह जानकर विशेष हर्ष है कि इस अवसर पर देश विदेश के विशेषज्ञ न केवल व्याख्यान देंगे और अपने अनुभव साझा करेंगे बल्कि SGPGIMS सहित देश विदेश में विभिन्न स्थानों से भी वास्तविक शल्य प्रक्रिया का प्रसारण होगा। मुझे बताया गया है कि देश विदेश के लगभग 1500 विशेषज्ञ इस आयोजन में भाग ले रहे हैं जो अपने अनुभव का लाभ साझा करेंगे।

I am delighted to inaugurate the Annual Meeting of the National Interventional Council (NIC), of the Cardiological Society of India which is being held from the 5th to the 7th of April, 2019, at the prestigious Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, under the aegis of the Uttar Pradesh State Chapter of the Cardiological Society of India.

I am happy to know that the Cardiological Society of India, right from its inception in 1948, has been tirelessly championing the cause of a healthy heart for the common Indian. It is truly noteworthy that through training, knowledge exchange and skill development of over 5000 cardiologists all over the country, the fraternity is working hard to create a healthy nation. 

I am told that the Society also has various Sub – specialty councils which keep track of various types of Cardiovascular Diseases and its treatment protocols, with the National Interventional Council (NIC) being premier amongst them. I am pleased to know that the NIC focuses upon newer interventional techniques which can help a patient recuperate quicker and get back to life faster, unlike conventional Cardiac procedures which come with a long recovery period.   

NIC 2019, I am told, is the Annual Meeting of the Council. I am happy to know that the Department of Cardiology, SGPGIMS, headed by the Prof.PK Goel who is also the organizing chairman, is one of the premier Post Graduate Medical Research Centres in the country.

I am happy to know that the meeting would include global and Indian experts speaking on varied topics and performing live interventional procedures from abroad, and from various centres in India, including SGPGIMS. It is truly noteworthy that the conference is set to witness participation of close to 1500 delegates from different parts of the world.

I hope that the congress would be successful in helping Cardiologists to equip themselves better to meet new challenges in the healthcare sector and to give the best care to their patients at affordable rates.

Esteemed members of the medical fraternity seated before me today,

Let me begin by congratulating you for your great service to the nation. 

India’s health sector has achieved a number of significant milestones since independence. Post-independence India’s most noteworthy achievement in the public health arena has been the increase in the at-birth life expectancy from around 37 years in 1951 to around 68.3 years in 2011-15.  

Although the life expectancy has increased the rise in the non communicable diseases is adversely affecting the quality of life.

Infant Mortality and Maternal Mortality have been greatly reduced, diseases such as small pox and polio have been eradicated, and leprosy has been nearly eliminated. Today, the country aspires to achieve Universal Health Coverage.

We have greatly improved the penetration of healthcare services across the country, undertaken extensive health education and awareness campaigns, conducted massive sanitation drives, increased the number of government and private hospitals in India exponentially and have greatly improved immunisation.  

We have survived a number of epidemics and have successfully mitigated numerous public health crises. 

All these achievements would not have been possible in a highly populous, resource constrained nation like India, had it not been for the selfless and dedicated service done by committed doctors and healthcare professionals such as yourself. 

My dear sisters and brothers,

It is a matter of great concern that India is witnessing an epidemiological transition. Non-communicable diseases are on the increase.

In a 2017 report of India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), it has been observed that the disease burden due to communicable, diseases, dropped from 61 per cent to 33 per cent between 1990 and 2016 and in the same period, disease burden from non-communicable diseases increased from 30 per cent to 55 per cent.

This is a deeply disturbing trend.

Heart disease is reportedly killing approximately 17 million people in the world.

The death rate due to cardio vascular diseases in India rose by 34% from 1990 to 2016. 

What is even more a matter of concern is the fact that that 40 per cent people in our country who develop heart attack are under the age of 55.

It has been estimated that almost 25 per cent of the people who die of heart attacks are less than 35 years of age. 

I understand that factors such as high levels of stress, increased incidences of diabetes and blood pressure aggravated by smoking, excessive consumption of alcohol, lack of exercise and lack of proper sleep contribute greatly to Cardio Vascular Diseases.

 

Life style modification is one of the key interventions needed to prevent premature heart attacks. 

 

I urge all the doctors and health care professionals present here to give primacy to educating people about changing their sedentary life styles. It has been proven beyond doubt that regular moderate intensity aerobic exercise like brisk walking, cycling, jogging, and swimming for five days a week helps in reducing the probability of heart disease.

The world is now celebrating Yoga as a means to achieve physical, mental and spiritual health and wellbeing. It is an excellent stress management technique and is an effective remedy for a number of diseases, especially lifestyle related ones.

We must encourage our children to be physically active and be involved in sports and games. 

Initiatives of the government such as Khelo India, which aspire to mould fit and healthy individuals who would create an equally healthy society and a strong nation, will go a long way in promoting health and wellbeing of our children.  

We must also encourage our children to thrive on healthy food, instead of junk food that is rich in highly damaging trans-fats.

I advise everyone, particularly the youngsters to say no to junk food which is causing harm to their health and affecting quality of life.

Our daily diet must include plenty of vegetables, fruits, nuts, soya products and low-fat dairy products which are rich in proteins, have less fat, no cholesterol and are rich in calcium and minerals.

India today stands poised to reap the biggest demographic dividend in history. It is one of those nations of the world with a burgeoning youth population.

For India to achieve its dream of inclusive and sustainable development and occupy its rightful place of leadership in the world, it is imperative that its youth population, brimming with potential, be healthy.

We must therefore invest much of our resources in prevention and early detection of disease. 

We must conduct massive screening drives to identify risk factors that heighten the chance of Cardio Vascular Disease among people and undertake measures to arrest the progress of the disease.

Our primary health centres should serve as bulwarks in our battle against Cardio Vascular Diseases. 

Dear sisters and brothers

Although our health care system consisting of Primary Health Centers, Taluk hospitals, and District hospitals is catering to the health requirements of the rural people, the need of the hour is to provide state-of-the-art healthcare facilities in the rural and remote areas as most of the modern hospitals are located in urban areas. Our efforts are also being hampered by factors such as the rapidly growing population, vast country with diverse terrain, local prejudices, superstitions and illiteracy.

While successive governments at the national and state levels have been according highest priority to the health sector, the private sector needs to supplement the efforts of the government, especially in bridging the urban-rural divide. The private sector should work with a spirit of altruism, commitment and missionary zeal in providing modern and affordable healthcare facilities in the rural areas.

I encourage all the medical students I interact with, to render service for at least 3 years in PHCs in rural areas. 

Our PHCs are the first point of contact with patients. A robust, responsive and well equipped network of PHCs can greatly reduce the burden on secondary and tertiary healthcare institutions by focussing on disease prevention and early detection and treatment. 

My dear Sisters and brothers, 

We must not falter in our response to communicable diseases either.

We must also strive to fortify our response towards medical emergencies and further strengthen our readiness to combat breakout of epidemics such as the recent Nipah virus outbreaks witnessed in Kerala. 

We would have to prepare ourselves to deal with a number of mutated versions of microorganisms, resistant to antibiotics and drugs that would arise due to changing climate and unprecedented levels of pollution.

India must also invest much more resources in Research and Development to keep pushing the frontiers of knowledge and keep evolving new and improved protocols for treatment of diseases.

It is not sufficient to prolong the lifespan of an individual. The years of life added must also have quality and must be fulfilling. 

For this to happen, we must keep exploring the unexplored and be brave enough to venture into new fields of medical science. 

Science and technology are breaking barriers and conquering new heights all over the world.

India must not miss out. 

There are unimaginable advancements being made in Medical Science. Cutting edge research in disruptive technologies such as Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and augmented reality are altering the paradigms of medical science. 

I would like to urge Doctors and medical professionals to always, resolutely follow the Hippocratic Oath and the principles of medical ethics. 

We must constantly strive to improve our health sector along three vectors, Quality, Accessibility and Affordability.

India is already known as the pharmacy to the world because of its good quality, affordable drugs. Although our health care services are among the cheapest in the world, some of the life saving drugs and procedures are still beyond the reach of the common man. All the stakeholders in the health sectors need to work in synergy to ensure that health care is affordable and accessible to common man.

India must also stand out and serve as a model for quality, affordable healthcare for other nations to emulate.  I have no doubt that we have the capability to achieve this goal and more. 

We have already introduced the health insurance scheme, the largest in the world that is benefiting lakhs patients. However the need of the hour is to ensure Universal Health Coverage in letter and spirit. 

We cannot rest until we secure the health of the last malnourished child and cure the last Tuberculosis patient. 

The task at hand is by no means an easy one.But I have full faith in the capabilities of India’s healthcare professionals. 

Let me once again congratulate the Cardiological Society of India for envisioning the NIC 2019 as a platform for synthesis of new ideas.

I wish the Society and this conference all the very best.

 

Thank You

 

Jai Hind!

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that promotion and protection of ancient Indian languages was the need of the hour as they offer a window to our ancient civilisational values, knowledge and wisdom.

 

Addressing the gathering after conferring around 100 ‘President’s Certificate of Honour’ and ‘Maharshi Badrayan Vyas Samman’ Awards to scholars in Classical Languages, here today, Shri Naidu said “When a language dies, an entire culture dies. We simply cannot let that happen. Protecting our cultural heritage, including languages is our constitutionally mandated duty”, he asserted.

 

Observing that studies by experts estimate that almost 600 languages were on the verge of extinction and more than 250 languages have disappeared in the past 60 years, the Vice President that the modern Indian languages have ancient roots and are derived in some way from the classical languages. “If we don’t preserve and sustain this link, we lose a very precious key to the treasure house we have all inherited”, he warned.

 

Emphasizing that language preservation and development needed multi-pronged approach, Shri Naidu said it should begin at the primary school level and continued to higher levels of education. “Functional literacy in at least one language should be ensured”, he added. 

 

Urging people to start using their native languages at home, in the community, in meetings and in administration, the Vice President called for a national movement to protect and preserve the mother tongue. He asked the state governments, Centre, academicians and the school administrations to provide primary and higher education in mother tongue.

 

Shri Naidu also wanted adequate attention to be given to dialects and folk literature, apart from encouraging Indian language publications, journals and children’s books in local languages. “We must accord a sense of pride to those who speak, write and communicate in these languages, he added. 

 

Saying that language was a vehicle of intergenerational transmission of culture, scientific knowledge and a worldview, the Vice President said that language evolves with human evolution and gets nourished by constant use.

 

The Vice President called for measures to encourage scholars to do research using the primary sources and unearth new nuggets of knowledge. ‘We must keep on adding to the knowledge and illuminate our present and future,’ he said.

 

“We must harness the power of technology to preserve and promote our languages and culture. We must have many more technological tools for communication in local languages to serve the needs of all our people speaking different languages”, Shri Naidu stressed.

 

The prestigious event organised by the HRD Ministry witnessed the presence of around 100 eminent scholars, linguists who have made immense contribution to protection and promotion of Indian Classical Languages through their writings in prose, poetry and several other literary works. Awards were presented for their stellar work in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, Pali, Prakrit, Classical Kannada, Classical Telugu, and Classical Malayalam for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.

 

Shri Naidu also released Linguistic Data Resources for Artificial Intelligence and launched Data Distribution Portal that helps in developing language technology and artificial intelligence tools for many Indian languages.

 

The Data Resource released by the Vice President was the largest corpora for these languages available so far in the public domain. It comprises 31 large text and speech data sets in 19 scheduled Indian languages. The Data Distribution Portal launched would be made available for free to the academic and not-for-profit research organizations.

 

The Secretary, Dept. of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Shri R. Subrahmanyam, the Director CIL, Prof. D.G. Rao, the Vice Chancellor of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sanskthan, Prof. P.N Shastri, the Joint Secretary (Management & Languages), Dept of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Shri Sanjay Kumar Sinha and several senior bureaucrats of government of India were present.  

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:  

 


“I am indeed blessed to be among eminent linguists and scholars today and present the President Award Honors to them for their service to the preservation and development of classical languages.

I heartily welcome all the renowned scholars who are keeping alive the traditional knowledge and who are acting as the intellectual bridges between the past and the present. 

The great Indian poet Acharya Dandi, had said that if the light of language does not exist, we will be groping in a dark world.  

Language is a tool for intellectual and emotional expression.  

Language is a vehicle of intergenerational transmission of culture, scientific knowledge and a worldview.  

It is the vital, unseen thread that links the past with the present.  

It evolves with human evolution and gets nourished by constant use. 

I have always emphasized the importance of protecting and conserving our linguistic heritage. Our languages are a crucial part of our history, our culture and our evolution as a society. In fact, they define our identity, traditions and customs. They play a significant role in creating and strengthening bonds among the people.

Ours is a multilingual country where more than 19,500 languages or dialects are spoken. However, almost 97 per cent of the population speaks one of the 22 scheduled languages.

The modern Indian languages have ancient roots and are derived in some way from the classical languages. 

The classical languages provide the window to our past, to the civilizational values of yesteryears, to the knowledge and wisdom of our ancient thinkers, scientists, poets, sages, doctors, philosophers and rulers. 

If we don’t preserve and sustain this link, we lose a very precious key to the treasure house we have all inherited. 

Studies by experts estimate that almost 600 languages are on the verge of extinction and that more than 250 languages have disappeared in the past 60 years. 

When a language dies, an entire culture dies. We simply cannot let that happen. Protecting our cultural heritage, including languages is our constitutionally mandated duty. Studying ancient texts and propagating them to modern audiences in the need of the hour.  I am glad that today we are recognizing scholars who are engaged in this sacred mission. 

Since studying the classical languages and literature would provide access to authentic sources of history, National Mission for Manuscripts was set up when Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister. 

The major objective of the mission is to unearth vast manuscript wealth in India and use modern and indigenous techniques to conserve them. It is estimated that India possesses about 10 million manuscripts, probably the largest collection in the world.

Preservation of ancient texts is only the first step.  What we need to do is to encourage scholars to do research using these primary sources and unearth new nuggets of knowledge.  We must keep on adding to the knowledge and illuminate our present and future. 

I am happy to note that the Indian government’s scheme seeks to reward dedicated scholars both in India and abroad for the development of various classical languages. 

I am told that the purpose of the scheme is to recognize the life-long work of the scholars and talented scholars of Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, Arabic, Persian, Classical Telugu, Classical Kannada, Classical Oriya and Classical Malayalam languages.

Dear sisters and brothers, 

Language preservation and development needs a multi-pronged approach. 

It should begin at the primary school level and be continued to higher levels of education. Functional literacy in atleast one language should be ensured.

More and more people should start using their native languages at home, in the community, in meetings and in administration.  More people should write poetry, stories, novels and dramas in these languages. We must accord a sense of dignity and a sense of pride to those who speak, write and communicate in these languages. We must encourage Indian language publications, journals and children’s books.  Dialects and folk literature must be given adequate focus. 

Language should become a catalyst for inclusive development. 

Language promotion should be an integral part of good governance. 

Sisters and brothers,

Today we are living in a rapidly changing world in which technology is transforming the way we live and work. We must harness the power of technology to preserve and promote our languages and culture. 

I am glad that today we are taking an important step in that direction. 

I am delighted to release Linguistic Data Resources for Artificial Intelligence.

This fills in a major gap in our existing IT architecture. 

The resources required to develop language technology and artificial intelligence based tools are inadequate or unavailable for many Indian languages. To fill this gap, the Government of India has launched the scheme of Linguistic Data Consortium for Indian Languages (LDC-IL) in 2008 and has been preparing high quality linguistic resources since over the last eleven years in all the scheduled languages of India.

Today we are releasing 31 large text and speech datasets in 19 scheduled Indian languages. These are the largest corpora for these languages available so far in the public domain.

Along with this, I am happy that a Data Distribution Portal is also being launched where more and varied datasets will be added in the coming days using several types of Artificial Intelligence based technologies such as automatic dictation, speech recognition, language understanding, machine translation, grammar and spell check.

While these datasets are available for free to the academic and not-for-profit research organizations, these are also available to industry at a very economical cost.

I am sure that the release of these resources marks the beginning of new era for the availability of cutting edge IT tools in Indian languages and breaks the language barrier in the digital domain.

Dear friends, our lives are impacted by Artificial Intelligence (AI) on a daily basis at every level.

If we can use AI and build capabilities and tools in local languages, it can certainly help us to democratize knowledge acquisition as well as knowledge preservation and development. 

We must have many more technological tools for communication in local languages to serve the needs of all our people speaking different languages. 

The mission of “digital India” can be a mission for a literate India and a mission for an inclusive knowledge society. 

The Central Institute of Indian Languages has been doing commendable work to provide the linguistic resources in Indian languages. I do hope they will continue these efforts with renewed enthusiasm.

With a total of 31 datasets in 19 scheduled languages presently available for download, I hope that all the technical and research institutes, start-ups and researchers will be able to take advantage of these databases.

I would like to once again congratulate all the distinguished scholars. My best wishes to the Ministry of Human Resource Development, and the institutes engaged in the preservation, propagation and popularization of Indian languages. 

मैं आप सभी विद्वत्जनों को राष्ट्रपति पुरस्कार से सम्मानित होने की हार्दिक बधाई देता हूं।

बहनों और भाईयों

भारतीय परंपरा में माना गया है कि सृष्टि का निर्माण ही शब्दनाद से हुआ है। मानव का व्यक्तित्व और विचार संसार भाषा से ही बनते हैं।

भाषाई विविधता का अपना सौंदर्य है। भाषाओं के उपवन में ही विचारों और अभिव्यक्ति के फूल खिलते हैं। किसी भाषा के समाप्त होने के साथ एक संस्कृति, उसका संस्कार बोध विलुप्त होता है। मानव चेतना की विकास श्रृंखला में एक अपूरर्णीय रिक्तता आती है।

यदि हम विदेशी भाषाऐं सीख सकते हैं तो हम भारतीय भाषाओं को कहीं आसानी से सीख सकते हैं। उनके समृद्ध साहित्य को आसानी से समझ सकते हैं। साहित्य अकादमी, नेशनल बुक ट्रस्ट जैसी संस्थाओं को विभिन्न भारतीय भाषाओं के श्रेष्ठ साहित्य का सरल, सुगम अनुवाद उपलब्ध कराना चाहिए।

 हमारे संस्कार एक हैं, हमारी संवेदनाऐं समान हैं। सदियों का सांस्कृतिक आदान प्रदान हमारी प्राचीन भाषाओं के साहित्य में झलकता है।

सम्मानीय विद्वत्जन,

भारत की अद्भुत भाषाई विविधता, हमारी साहित्यिक धरोहर के संरक्षण में आपका महत्वपूर्ण सहयोग अपेक्षित है। आप भारत के साहित्यिक और सांस्कृतिक पुनर्जागरण के पुरोधा बनें, समाज आपसे मार्गदर्शन की अपेक्षा करता है।

जय हिन्द!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for the promotion of new and renewable energy in a big way. He said moving to renewable would not just ensure energy security but also protect the climate, reduce pollution.

‘Adequate growth in renewable energy would serve dual purpose - firstly, it would contribute towards achieving energy security to the nation and it would address the environmental concerns, which need to be tackled on a war-footing,’ he said.

Addressing gathering after inaugurating the GRIDTECH 2019, an International Exhibition and Conference, organised by the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited to deliberate on new technologies in transformation, distribution, renewable integration, Smart Grid Communication, the Vice President asked experts to find out new technologies to harness renewable energy to fulfill India’s energy demands and also to fulfill India’s international commitment to de-carbonize the electricity generation.

Shri Naidu also called for the promotion of clean and green mode of transport, such as Electrical Vehicles (EVs) on a large scale. He said that they have the potential to save foreign exchange on crude oil import apart from reducing carbon emissions. He also called for inclusion of renewable energy provisions right from the planning of towns. 

The Vice President said that world was looking towards India for investments and opined that India's economic growth was the main factor for the new found enthusiasm of the world community.

Opining that rapid urbanization led to increased energy demand and rise of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, Shri Naidu urged technologists to find new methods for tapping the huge potential in the renewable energy sector and also wanted them to educate the common man on the need to cut down GHG emissions.

Pointing that connectivity and electricity were key to development, Shri Naidu stressed upon the need to address challenges such as pilferages in transmission and distribution. He suggested developing a suitable transmission and distribution system to facilitate renewable integration. ‘Smart grid technologies used by many countries would have the potential to solve the challenges,’ he added.

The Vice President had earlier inaugurated the GRIDTECH 2019 exhibition, went around the stalls and interacted with the presenters at the stalls. He said he was happy to have met and interacted with students who were showcasing their innovative ideas to promote, use renewable energy.

The Secretary, Ministry of Power, Shri Ajay Kumar Bhalla, the officials of Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd, representatives from Conventional and Renewable energy sector, students from  prestigious institutions such as the IITs and others were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:  

“It is a matter of immense pleasure for me to address you at the inauguration of GRIDTECH 2019. 

This international conference and exhibition is a wonderful opportunity for Power System professionals in Industry and Academia to exchange ideas and deliberate on environment friendly solutions to overcome the challenges faced in the energy sector.

In view of the increasing demand in the power sector with each passing day, we need to fully tap the potential for sustainable and environmental-friendly energy. We need to find out new technologies to harness renewable energy in a big way. 

As you all are aware, India has made an international commitment to de-carbonize the electricity generation. Towards this end, India has set a time-bound target of installing 175 GW of renewable generation by 2022, comprising 100 GW Solar, 60 GW Wind and 15 GW of other forms of renewable generation.

With the focus increasingly shifting to clean energy in recent years, India has become an attractive destination for investments in renewable energy sector.

Dear friends, the rapid urbanization, we are witnessing, has become an irreversible phenomenon and is leading to increased energy demand as also release of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. I would like technologists to not only find new methods for tapping the huge potential in the renewable energy sector, but also educate the common man on the need to cut down GHG emissions. 

India, like some other countries, is planning to develop solar cities and I would like the urban local bodies to be in the forefront in adopting renewable energy technologies and converting their cities into renewable energy cities. I am told that under the “Solar City” concept, it is aimed to reduce the projected demand for conventional energy by 10 per cent at the end of five years by enhancing supply from renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures.

Dear sisters and brothers, please note that adequate growth in renewable energy would serve dual purpose-- firstly, it would contribute towards achieving energy security to the nation and it would address the environmental concerns, which need to be tackled on a war-footing.

However, the generation of renewable power has quite a few challenges. Unlike conventional power generation, renewable generations are intermittent and variable in nature, posing a challenge towards maintaining energy balance in real-time. It also has low gestation period compared to conventional generation. Hence, the associated transmission and distribution system should be developed in a suitable manner to facilitate renewable integration. 

Presently, electricity is flowing across the country through the robust National Grid, without many constraints in the network. I am told that facilitating large scale renewable energy integration with grid would require more flexible generation from conventional energy sources, grid scale energy storage facilities, flexible transmission system and demand side management through customer participation.

Further, distribution sector is the most crucial link in the electricity supply chain.  While the government is making concerted efforts to improve the distribution sector through various programmes, I am told that the aim is to bring down AT&C losses to the level of 15% or below and improve efficiency in the distribution sector. 

Experience of various countries worldwide has shown that emerging smart grid technologies have the potential to solve the challenges posed by the distribution sector. They can also help in better integration and distribution of large scale renewable energy. As a matter-of-fact, several smart grid projects are being undertaken in India. 

In our endeavour to promote sustainability and clean and green mode of transport, Electrical Vehicles (EVs) are being encouraged on a large scale. Electrical Vehicles have the potential to save foreign exchange on crude oil import.  I am told that the Ministry of Power is facilitating this initiative by formulating necessary polices and regulations to ensure the availability of EV-charging infrastructure for customers.

Friends, challenges are many and unprecedented. It is prudent that, experts from the Industry, academia and policy makers have gathered here to find sustainable solutions to these problems. 

Further, it is also important for the upcoming young engineers and researchers from technical institutions to keep abreast with cutting edge technologies. 

GRIDTECH 2019 is an excellent platform for evolution of new ideas in the energy sector through brainstorming by seasoned professionals. I am glad that GRIDTECH 2019 also has a Student Pavilion and I hope this will give the young students an opportunity to showcase their own innovative ideas. 

I am hopeful that GRIDTECH 2019 will serve as a platform for continued cooperation between all the stakeholders and will help the power sector to grow and meet the aspirations of the common people at large. 

I wish all the best for a successful GRIDTECH 2019.

Thank You

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the time has arrived for India to re orient present education system to inculcate values, morals and ethics in students and to re-established itself as a knowledge and innovation hub. He called for a complete overhaul of the higher education system so that it caters to the fast changing requirements of the 21st century. ‘Apart from remolding the syllabi and pedagogy, the stress should be on learning-by-doing’, he suggested.

Addressing the 32 Convocation of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), here today, the Vice President asked the students to work with dedication and sincerity to realize their dreams. He presented degrees and diplomas to more than 2 Lakh students who were graduating from the main campus of IGNOU and various regional centres today. He urged the students to prove themselves to be worthy of the certificates, diplomas and degrees they had received.

Shri Naidu stressed that everybody must strive to build a New India, which was free of poverty, illiteracy, fear, corruption, hunger and discrimination. Saying that quality assurance was important for improving higher education sector, he called for stringent measures to address excessive commercialization and poor governance in private and government-funded institutions respectively.

The Vice President said that Higher education must transform an individual into a responsible human being with social, moral and ethical values instilled in him or her, apart from making the person more productive. He further said that the quality assurance and accreditation mechanism must acknowledge the transformative role of education in a broader sense and facilitate in widening the horizons of Indian higher education system.

Saying that India was placed in an advantageous position because of the demographic dividend, the Vice President opined that ensuring skill development and imparting latest training in various vocations to the youth was necessary to make them a skilled workforce.

Shri Naidu opined that preserving India’s traditional knowledge base and integrating it with modern educational system was of great importance as we rapidly advance towards building a knowledge-based society. Shri Naidu also wanted framers of our education policy to focus upon teaching in local languages along with inculcating the spirit of volunteerism in students by way of activities such as NCC, NSS and others.

Observing that Information and Communication Technology brought a paradigmatic shift in the education sector, Shri Naidu called upon institutions such as IGNOU to impart ICT skills to students apart from regular academics so that they can apply them in areas of their engagement - such as agriculture, industry, business or service. He observed that online education is the best mode of learning as it has the potential to reach the unreached in every corner of the country via internet and help in improving the literacy rate.

Mentioning that India’s rich cultural heritage, Ayurveda and Yoga had earned global recognition, Shri Naidu said that 177 countries adopting a resolution at the United Nations declaring June 21 as International Day of Yoga was a testimony to India’s growing influence in the world. He instructed universities and educational institutions to promote India’s vast body of indigenous knowledge especially in the fields of Yoga and Ayurveda.

Shri Naidu said Ayurveda, which has its origins in the Vedic culture as an indigenous system of natural healing has once again emerged as a major source of knowledge on diagnosis, treatment and healing. ‘However, to ensure patient safety and efficacy, every system of medicine should be evidentiary and based on thorough research and widespread clinical trials’, he cautioned.

The Vice President urged the students to uphold ethical values at all times and remain committed to preserving India’s culture, traditions and heritage. He asked them to give utmost priority to protecting nature. ‘Promote culture and protect nature for a better future,’ he added.

The Vice President lauded the efforts of the University for making knowledge acquisition accessible to many learners, who otherwise were unable to attend regular institutions of higher learning. He opined that IGNOU was effectively serving the educational needs of the learners by breaking the barriers of distance through different mediums - the print, audio, video, online delivery as also interpersonal interaction.

The Vice Chancellor of IGNOU, Prof. Nageshwar Rao, the Pro-Vice Chancellor of IGNOU, Prof. Ravindra Ramachandra Kanhere, the Registrar, Directors of the School of Studies, Heads of Divisions and Units, Faculty and Staff Members of the university and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“इंदिरा गांधी राष्ट्रीय मुक्त विश्वविद्यालय के बत्तीसवें दीक्षांत समारोह में भाग ले कर अत्यंत हर्ष का अनुभव कर रहा हूं। इस विश्वविद्यालय की स्थापना उच्च शिक्षा के लोक तंत्रीकरण के उद्देश्य से की गई थी। गत वर्षों में यह विश्वविद्यालय उन वर्गो तक शिक्षा पहुंचाने मैं सफल रहा है जो अन्यथा शिक्षा की रोशनी से महरूम थे। वे लोग भी शिक्षा प्राप्त कर सके जो शिक्षा संस्थानों में नियमित पढ़ाई कर सकने में असमर्थ थे।

आपने विद्या और विद्यार्थी के बीच की दूरी मिटा कर सचमुच समाज की सेवा की है। आपने संचार की आधुनिक तकनीक का प्रयोग  शिक्षा को सुदूर क्षेत्रों में प्रसारित करने में बखूबी किया है। आपने पाठ्य सामग्री को दृश्य श्रव्य, ऑन लाइन तथा सुरुचिपूर्ण ढंग से प्रकाशित पुस्तकों  के रूप में उपलब्ध कराया है और शिक्षा को सुदुरतम क्षेत्रों में सुगम बनाया है।

मुझे हर्ष है कि छात्रों के पंजीकरण तथा पाठ्यक्रमों की दृष्टि से यह विश्वविद्यालय संसार का सबसे बड़ा विश्वविद्यालय है। विगत वर्षों में इस विश्वविद्यालय ने राष्ट्रीय अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर ख्याति अर्जित की है।

मुझे यह भी ज्ञात हुआ है कि इग्नू  ने अपने कार्यक्षेत्र का व्यापक विस्तार किया है। आज देशपर्यंत, इस विश्वविद्यालय के 3500 अध्ययन केंद्र  है तथा 56 क्षेत्रीय केंद्र है जिनके माध्यम से शिक्षा का प्रसार किया जा रहा है। 

मुझे विशेष संतोष है कि भारतीय सेना, नौसेना तथा असम राइफल जैसे सुरक्षा बलों  के लिए 11 क्षेत्रीय केंद्र स्थापित किए हैं। कठिन उत्तरदायित्व और विषम परिस्थितियों में सुरक्षा बलों में सेवाओं की विशेष स्थिति को देखते हुए, आपका यह प्रयास सराहनीय है। मुझे विश्वास है कि सुरक्षा बलों के सैनिक और अधिकारी इस सुविधा का लाभ उठाएंगे। इसके अतिरिक्त इग्नू ने विदेशों में भी 26 अध्ययन केंद्र स्थापित किए हैं। गुणवत्ता पूर्ण सुदूर शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में,  इन क्षेत्रों के माध्यम से इग्नू ने राष्ट्रीय और अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय उपस्थिति दर्ज की है।

I am extremely happy to be here among you today at the 32nd Convocation of  IGNOU which was founded on the cherished philosophy of ‘democratization of education’ and ‘reaching the unreached’. This university has made knowledge acquisition accessible to many learners, who otherwise were unable to attend regular institutes of higher learning.

It is effectively serving the educational needs of the learners by breaking the barriers of distance through different mediums – the print, audio, video, online delivery as also interpersonal interaction. 

I am happy to learn that IGNOU is the largest university of the world in terms of student enrolment and programs offered. Over the years, IGNOU has received national and international acclaim.

I am glad to learn that IGNOU has developed a network of over 3500 Study Centres, 56 Regional Centers and 11 Recognized Regional Centres for Indian Army, Navy and Assam Rifles across the country, apart from 26 Overseas Study Centres. Indeed, IGNOU has made its presence felt both nationally and internationally by providing quality education through Open Distance Learning system.

I am delighted to learn that IGNOU today has cumulative student strength of over 32 lakhs students, who are pursuing more than 241 academic programmes.

On this momentous occasion, I congratulate all the 2.02 lakh students of IGNOU who are receiving their certificates, diplomas and degrees from this esteemed university. I also wish them all the best in their future endeavors and to be the worthy of the certificates, diplomas and degrees they have earned.

Dear students, please remember that your learning does not end with the acquisition of an educational degree. Learning is an ongoing process and you need to upgrade knowledge on a daily basis to face a highly competitive world. As you all are aware, India was once known as Vishwaguru and students from across the world used to come here and study in reputed learning centres like Takshashila. Following foreign invasions and colonization, we lost that pre-eminent position.

India has a rich treasure of ancient knowledge. The knowledge contained in our traditional scriptures, like Vedas, Upanishads and other ancient texts was passed on from generation to generation and made India the spiritual leader of the world.

We have inherited a vast body of indigenous knowledge through Yoga and Ayurveda. The practice of Yoga helps in leading a healthy and balanced life style. In view of its beneficial effects, as many as 177 countries adopted a resolution at the United Nations declaring June 21 as International Day of Yoga. I feel that there is a need to promote Yoga in our educational and training institutions.

Ayurveda has its origins in the Vedic culture as an indigenous system of natural healing. Unfortunately due to prolong foreign rule in the country the practice of Ayurveda got sidelined and neglected. Now Ayurveda has been emerging as a major source of diagnosis, treatment and healing. However, to ensure patient safety and efficacy, every system of medicine should be evidentiary and based on thorough research and widespread clinical trials.

Dear youngsters, the time has come now for India to re-establish itself as a knowledge and innovation hub. For that to happen, we have to completely overhaul our higher education system to cater to the fast changing requirements of the 21st century in different sectors. Apart from remoulding the syllabi and pedagogy, the stress should be on learning-by-doing. According to the latest All India Survey on Higher Education (2017-18), there are 903 universities and the total number of colleges stands at 49,061. Currently, the total number of students enrolled in our colleges and universities is about 36.7 million.

Although our GER has improved to 25.8 per cent, it lags behind the global average of 33 percent and those of the emerging economies like Brazil (46 percent), Russia (78 percent) and China (36 percent).        

With Indian economy on the rise, all of you will have plenty of avenues and opportunities and you should seize them. But remember that there is no substitute to hard work. Set goals and persevere to achieve them. As exhorted by the former President, dream high and aim high. But work with dedication and sincerity to realize your dreams and a build a New India, which shall be free of poverty, illiteracy, fear, corruption, hunger and discrimination.

Looking at your young and enlightened faces, I am reminded of Swami Vivekananda’s famous exhortation: “Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.”  

Now your ideal should be as said in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: “Asato Ma Sad Gamaya, Tamaso Ma Jyotir Gamaya, Mrityor Ma Amritam Gamaya--Lead us from ignorance to truth, Lead us from darkness to light, Lead us from death to deathlessness”.

As India is rapidly advancing towards a knowledge-based society, it should preserve its traditional knowledge base and integrate it with modern educational system of the country. 

Dear students,

India is placed in an advantageous position when compared to many other countries because 65 per cent of our population is below the age of 35 years. By ensuring skill development and imparting latest training in various vocations to the youth, India can cater to the global requirements of skilled workforce, apart from meeting the demand within the country. I am sure that the National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship will address all the challenges of skilling, while the National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) will help standardize and integrate the skill component of the people with the formal learning arrangement.

We are now living in an Information and Communication Technology-driven world. With 46% people having access over internet and 92% over mobile phones, imparting ICT- enabled education has become the sine qua non of the modern society. In fact, ICT revolution is triggering a paradigmatic shift in the education sector.

As you all are aware, Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) platform is set to bring a revolution in the arena of learning and knowledge dissemination. In India, SWAYAM MOOCs platform has emerged to be the World’s Largest Online Free E-Learning Platform Portal. It is designed to achieve access, equity and quality in education at all levels and areas. Again under the SWAYAM PRABHA programme high-quality educational programmes are telecast through the DTH channels. Further the MHRD under its National Mission on Education through ICT (NME-ICT)has initiated the e-Pathshala. The interactive e-content covers around 70 subjects across all disciplines of social sciences, arts, fine arts, humanities, mathematics, linguistics and languages.

The use of ICTs has made lives of millions of Indian comfortable now in most areas of their engagement—be it agriculture, industry, business or service. 

Quality assurance is important for improving higher education sector. The root cause of the problem in private and government-funded institutions is commercialization and poor governance respectively.

Higher education should transform an individual into a responsible human being with social, moral and ethical values embedded in him or her apart from making the person more productive. Thus, the quality assurance and accreditation mechanism should acknowledge the transformative role of education in a broader sense and facilitate in widening the horizons of the Indian higher education system.

I glad to learn that IGNOU has already launched several skill development programmes through Open and Distance Learning and ICT-enabled modes and has integrated skill component in its flagship Bachelor Degree programme under the Choice Based Credit System.

I must laud IGNOU for creating a wealth of academic e-content through its eGyanKosh- a National Digital Repository to store, index, preserve, distribute and share the digital learning resources. I am also happy to learn that IGNOU proposes to launch several online academic programmes soon and has also initiated a new Centre for On Line Learning for giving an impetus to this mode of learning.

Quality assurance is important for improving higher education sector. The root cause of the problem in private and government-funded institutions is commercialization and poor governance respectively. While the problems have to be tackled differently, a single standardised solution may not ensure improvement in quality across Higher Education institutions.

Finally, before concluding, I would like you all to remember the four pillars of learning that UNESCO had suggested.  

These are (1) Learning to know (2) Learning to do (3) Learning to be and (4) Learning to live together.  

You should be able to access new knowledge and use it for your advancement and the welfare of the people around you, you should develop new skills all the time and ultimately realize the hidden potential within you. Be what you aim to be. The last aspect is perhaps the most important one in our contemporary world – Learning to live together and celebrate the infinite diversity in the world.  

I would add that you should uphold ethical values at all times and remain committed to preserving India’s culture, traditions and heritage. Also, please give utmost priority to protecting nature. In other words, promote culture and protect nature for a better future. My best wishes to you all in your future endeavors!

आप सतत नया ज्ञान अर्जित करें, उसका प्रयोग अपने और वृहत्तर समाज की उन्नति और कल्याण के लिए करें। आप निरंतर अपने कौशल का विकास करें और अपनी क्षमताओं को पहचाने तथा उन्हे विकसित करें। आप अपने  अभीष्ट लक्ष्य को सिद्ध करें । सबसे आवश्यक है कि हम विभिन्न मतों और दृष्टिकोणों के साथ सौहार्द्र पूर्ण सहअस्तित्व सुनिश्चित करें। संसार की असीम विविधता का उत्सव मनाएं।

मैं अपील करूंगा कि जीवन में स्थापित नैतिक मूल्यों का पालन करें। भारतीय संस्कृति, परंपराओं, धरोहर के प्रति निष्ठा रखे, उनका संरक्षण करें। प्रकृति और पर्यावरण की सुरक्षा के प्रति संकल्पबद्ध रहें।अपने भविष्य की सुरक्षा के लिए प्रकृति का संरक्षण करें, संस्कृति का संवर्धन करे। आपकी भावी उपलब्धियों के लिए मेरी शुभकामनाएं।

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for creating an ecosystem for entrepreneurship to thrive and encourage youth to become job creators instead of job seekers.

 

Addressing the Summit on ""Empowering Young Grampreneurs to Create Jobs"" organized by the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), in Bhubaneswar, Odisha today, he said that unemployment was an area of major concern not only for India but for all the nations. The possible way to address unemployment was to ‘create the right ecosystem for youngsters to become entrepreneurs and set up their own businesses’, he added.

 

The Vice President said that India with its huge demographic advantage must reap benefits by harnessing the youth’s potential. He said there was a need to create the relevant infrastructure and impart the right skill sets for them to successfully overcome the challenges posed by the technology-dependent world.

 

“How efficiently and effectively we reap the demographic dividend depends greatly on how effectively we are able to create jobs and train the working population to do these jobs,” Shri Naidu added. 

 

Expressing concern over the rising urban rural divide, the Vice President stressed the need for making agriculture sustainable and profitable, creating market for rural artisans, empowering woman entrepreneurs to sell their crafts by way of online platforms and ensuring access to affordable education and healthcare.

 

The Vice President also advised young entrepreneurs to start businesses that promote India’s unique, traditional arts and crafts. He wanted the nation to monetize these unique capabilities and find new markets for these exceptional products through trade fairs and international exhibitions.

Opining that the rich craftsmanship was a key aspect of vibrant heritage of India, Shri Naidu said that there was a need to reinvent and re-imagine ‘brand India’ and revive our dying industries.

Saying that Small and Medium enterprises play an important role in economic development, the Vice President said that creating an ecosystem conducive to the functioning of SMEs and cottage industries were as important as facilitating large scale industries in giving a fillip to entrepreneurship.

 

“MSMEs contribute 6.11 per cent of manufacturing GDP and 24.6 per cent of services GDP. These industries which are often located in rural areas play a vital role in preserving India’s traditional skills and products such as handicrafts and handlooms”, he said.

 

Saying that entrepreneurship was valuable only if it had a multiplier effect on the prosperity of our local communities, especially in rural areas, the Vice President urged young businessmen to find the hidden strengths and advantages in rural India leverage them to provide livelihoods and raise standard of living of those living in remote areas.

 

Observing that Empowerment of women was central to achieving the objective of inclusive, equitable and sustainable development, the Vice President said that ‘women empowerment should not only be a national goal but a global agenda’.

 

Pointing out that women constitute only 14% of the total entrepreneurship i.e. 8.05 million out of the total 58.5 million entrepreneurs, Vice President said there was an urgent need to encourage more women to embark on the path of entrepreneurship.

 

The Vice President presented awards for achievers in rural entrepreneurship and launched BYST Entrepreneur Online Learning in Odia.

 

The Governor of Odisha, Shri Ganeshi Lal, the Members of Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), Founding and Managing Trustee, BYST Ms. Lakshmi, Shri V. Venkatesan, other stake holders from industry including the Director of JK Paper Ltd. Shri A.S. Mehta, President, the Chief of CSR, Tata Steel Ltd, Shri Shri Sourav Roy and more than 600 entrepreneurs from different parts of Odisha were present at the event.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

 

“Officials from the Government, Representatives from Media, BYST Grampreneurs & Mentors, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen.

I am delighted to join you for the Summit on ""Empowering Young Grampreneurs to Create Jobs"" in the presence of all the major stakeholders of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Odisha. 

It is indeed heartening to see brilliant, budding entrepreneurs from the grassroots level, particularly those from underserved communities sharing experiences and exchanging valuable lessons with business experts. 

I would like to extend my warm wishes to Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST) on having completed over 26 years in the service of under-privileged youth who are in search of better livelihood opportunities. 

I had the pleasure of addressing BYST’s Silver Jubilee at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in April 2017 and unveiling its flagship programme-- “Mentoring India”.

I am glad that BYST continues to play a pioneering role in the development of young entrepreneurship through effective mentoring. 

It is also heartening to learn that BYST has helped over 7,500 disadvantaged Indian youth to develop their business ideas into viable enterprises, since the organisation’s inception in 1992.

I am particularly happy to be here in the beautiful state of Odisha. The state is rich in minerals, metals and natural resources and has been successful in attracting investors and businesses from all over the world to its shores. 

In the last few years, the state has been on a path of rapid infrastructure development, constructing highways linking the far-off mineral rich districts to the ports and to the twin-cities of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar which had air and rail connectivity. 

It is truly noteworthy that the Government of Odisha has taken important initiatives in the last couple of years to create conducive ecosystem for Startups in the State.

 As a result, it has achieved the status of ‘Top Performer’ in the State Startup ranking exercise conducted by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Government of India. 

I see a very exciting future for Odisha; the opportunities before the state are truly endless. 

My dear sisters and brothers,

India stands poised at the brink of one of the most advantageous demographic profiles in history. We are one of the youngest nations of the world with 62.5% of the population in the age group of 15-59 years.

This incredible window of demographic dividend in India is available for five decades from 2005-06 to 2055-56, longer than any other country in the world. 

How efficiently and effectively we reap the demographic dividend depends greatly on how effectively we are able to create jobs and train the working population to do these jobs. 

Although, the digital revolution we are witnessing today may enable the creation of new products and more productive jobs, it may also end up substituting some of the existing jobs. One of the challenges would be to re-skill and retrain the existing workforce for taking up newer jobs.

No doubt, unemployment is an area of major concern not only for India but for all the nations, both emerging and developed. While addressing the problem of unemployment, we also need to look into the question of underemployment or underutilization of the human resources. 

A possible way to address unemployment is to create the right ecosystem for youngsters to become entrepreneurs and set up their own businesses. In other words, we need to ensure that they become job creators instead of job-seekers.  

It is generally accepted that entrepreneurs create jobs, boost innovation, enhance competition and are responsive and adaptable to changing economic opportunities and trends. 

Encouraging entrepreneurship in young people is an important way of harnessing their enthusiasm, energy, spirit and ambition to contribute to economic development. 

Many entrepreneurs do more than provide important goods and services-- their businesses help sustain the vitality of the neighbourhoods in which they live and work. 

Creating an ecosystem conducive to the functioning of Small and Medium enterprises and cottage industries is as important as facilitating large scale industries in giving a fillip to entrepreneurship.

MSMEs contribute 6.11 per cent of manufacturing GDP and 24.6 per cent of services GDP. These industries which are often located in rural areas play a vital role in preserving India’s traditional skills and products such as handicrafts and handlooms. 

India is home to highly skilled craftsmen. We must not let this rich aspect of our vibrant heritage be lost. We must encourage more young entrepreneurs to start businesses that promote India’s unique, traditional arts and crafts. 

We must monetize these unique capabilities and find new markets for these exceptional products.    

As important as enabling these industries to manufacture is developing their capabilities to brand their products and market them effectively, both in domestic and international markets through trade fairs and international exhibitions. 

The growth of 37.1 %, witnessed by ‘Khadi India’ in the last four years presents an important lesson to us on the importance of leveraging our inherent strengths and competitive advantages. 

We need to reinvent and re-imagine ‘brand India’ and revive our dying industries through our spirited young entrepreneurs. 

As the world is becoming more globalized, let me advice you to be more ‘local’. I urge the budding young entrepreneurs present here to source your raw materials locally and to recruit talent from your neighbourhood. 

Entrepreneurship is valuable only if it has a multiplier effect on the prosperity of our local communities, especially in rural areas. 

I encourage you to find those hidden strengths and advantages in your villages and communities and find creative ways to leverage and harness those strengths to provide livelihoods and raise standard of living of your entire community.

My dear sisters and brothers, 

Historically speaking, India has been perceived as the land of entrepreneurial opportunity to generations of foreign mercantilists. 

Our business community has been able to draw attention of the world over centuries for its remarkable capability to perceive economic opportunities; for its resilience to pursue them, and for delivering world-class products and services to different industries and geographies.

When I hear that BYST entrepreneurs have been winning national and international awards, I can see that they have inherited the great legacy of enterprise and resourcefulness that India is has always been famous for. 

Although we have much to celebrate, we must remember that 9 out of 10 jobs in India are still being created in the informal sector which affords little room for innovation and growth.

In India, we have a large eco-system of start-ups – the third largest in the world. 

Policies like Start-up India and Atal Innovation Mission are geared to support the start-up environment.

A dynamic and robust entrepreneurial eco-system is an asset to every economy; specifically, innovation-led entrepreneurship has significant potential to stimulate industrial growth. Entrepreneurs are the key drivers of industry.

The challenge for India’s policy-makers is to address constraints like access to credit and inadequate marketing support faced by entrepreneurs. I am sure that the authorities will come up with appropriate policy interventions wherever necessary. 

There is also a need to encourage more women to embark on the path of entrepreneurship. Currently, women constitute around 14% of the total entrepreneurship i.e. 8.05 million out of the total 58.5 million entrepreneurs.

A recent World Bank report has revealed that women employers tend to hire mostly women. But many of such women-owned firms are micro-household enterprises employing 1 to 2 persons.

Empowerment of women is central to achieving the objective of inclusive, equitable and sustainable development and it should not only be a national goal but a global agenda.

My dear Sisters and brothers, 

Corporate Social Responsibility is playing very important role in supporting the various development initiatives. Tata Steel and J K Paper, who are supporting the BYST programmes for entrepreneur development in Odisha, are shining examples of Corporate Social Responsibility.

There is also a big scope for private sector investment in mentoring and fostering small enterprises in the informal sector through appropriate linkages. 

NGOs, cooperatives and self help groups can provide these linkages. 

This summit, with its primary focus on grassroots entrepreneurship and mentoring is both timely and relevant.

I want each and every one of you to be part of the glorious mentoring movement of BYST – Mentoring India.

Mentoring has a special place is creating a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem. It is particularly relevant in rural India where there are lea avenues for self learning. 

I congratulate BYST once again for this eventful Summit. Let us together strengthen the spirit of mentoring and entrepreneurship through our determination, positive attitude and hard work. 

This will be in consonance with the true spirit of service to this great nation.

Thank you 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that education must lay the foundation for developing a society that is strongly grounded in ethics and moral values to ensure peace and contentment in life. 

Expressing his concern over the all-round degeneration of morals and ethics in the society, Shri Naidu said that the undesirable trend had to be stopped completely and schools were best placed for bringing about such a transformation.

Delivering the 10th Foundation Lecture at SAI International School in Bhubaneswar today, the Vice President said that education must inculcate social, moral, ethical and spiritual values apart from seeking to empower the future citizens with knowledge and wisdom.

‘What is important is your attitude towards fellow citizens, other living creatures, protecting the environment and your commitment towards the larger good of the society’, he said.

Shri Naidu also stressed upon the need to inculcate a sense of volunteerism among young students. He advised the students to join organisations like NCC, NSS, Scouts & Guides to learn life skills and volunteerism.

Referring to the seven deadly social sins mentioned by Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi ji, the Vice President said that education which does not build character was one of such sin.

Saying that schools play the most crucial and foundational role in shaping the destinies of a nation, the Vice President said that schooling must lay emphasis on the overall development of the child without focusing solely on academic achievements. He opined that it was extremely crucial for youngsters to become responsible, caring and empathetic citizens of the country.

The Vice President stressed that aligning the education with the best education pedagogies, teaching methods and techniques in the world, without losing our ethical moorings was necessary to regain India’s position as Vishwa Guru.

He advised schools to keep abreast with the latest methods of pedagogy and acquaint the students about the importance of the ancient civilization, culture, traditions, heritage and history of the country. “The understanding of the history should be complete and comprehensive without any scope for bias,” he said.

Shri Naidu advised schools to discard rote method of learning and promote innovative and creative thinking. He said that students must be encouraged to develop an inquisitive and questioning mind ever eager to learn new things and come out with bright ideas.

Shri Naidu wanted schools to keep themselves abreast with the rapid developments in technology and align the skill sets of the students in accordance with 21st century job market. He also advised the schools to promote entrepreneurial spirit among the students.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“It gives me immense pleasure to interact with students, teachers and parents of this institution and share my thoughts. Whenever I visit a school or a college, it fills me with intense optimism about the future of the country.

I have always held that schools are not just temples of learning but are important institutions that play a foundational role in shaping the destinies of a nation. They are the springboards for producing future teachers, scientists, doctors, engineers, chartered acountants, politicians and scholars in various disciplines.

Hence, good schooling which lays emphasis on overall development of the child without focusing solely on academic achievements is extremely crucial for youngsters to become responsible, caring and empathetic citizens of the country.

Dear students, you all have completed your exams and will soon be joining new academic session in the next class. I wish you every success in your academic career and a rewarding future.

 

Dear Friends,

 

In a school, we celebrate the colourful innovative ideas, innocent idealism, inculcate moral and ethical values and chase dreams with hope and optimism. 

As our former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam used to ask students to dream - “Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action.” Your dreams, ideals and ideas will shape the future of this great country.

Education is not only for employment.  It is meant for empwerment of an individual through knowledge and wisdom. While imparting knowledge and keeping abreast with the latest methods of pedagogy, schools must acquaint the students about the importance of our ancient civilization, culture, traditions, heritage and history.

The understanding of the history should be complete and comprehensive without any scope for bias.

Of the seven deadly social sins enunciated by Gandhi ji, Education which does not build character , was one of such sin. Apart from seeking to empower the future citizens with knowledge and wisdom, education must inculcate social, moral, ethical and spiritual values.What is important isyour attitude towards fellow citizens, other living creatures, protecting the environment and your commitment towards the larger good of the society.The Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi had put it most profoundly when he said : “The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated”.

True education emancipates you from the bondage of ignorance. It must remove obscurantist  beliefs and superstitions. In Indian Tradition it is said – “Ya Vidya Sa Vimuktaye” – What emanicipates is the Knowledge. It is an essential part of all human life which makes an individual civilized, refined, cultured and educated.

For ages India was the Vishwa Guru. We excelled in abstract sciences and applied technologies. Those were not the days of claiming Intellectual Property rights. Rather, we believed that the knowledge only grows if it is spread and shared with others. True to our ideal, “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” we shared our knowledge and excellence with global community. Our famous universities of Taxila, Nalanda threw open their doors for the students and scholars of other regions.

We have shared our knowledge and fortunes with every one as we believed in the sublime ideal of “ Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah, sarve santu nira maya” i.e. may everyone be satisfied, may everyone be free of disease and sickness. Sharing and Caring has not only been an ideal but an article of faith in our long distinguished traditions.

These eternal virtues have been at the core of our education system that has inculcated strong value systems from generation to generation. True education lays the foundation for developing a society that is strongly grounded in ethics and moral values leading to peace and contentment in life.

Unfortunately, over the years, we have been witnessing an all-round degeneration of morals and ethics in the society. This undesirable trend has to be stopped completely and schools are best placed for bringing about the transformation.

In Indian tradition, it is said: “Knowledge brings humility, humility makes you worthy, with that you acquire wealth and with wealth your conduct becomes righteous that eventually leads to ultimate blissful pleasure.” Education and knowledge are the basis of a civilised living. Thirukkural says “The wealth of learning is alone imperishable; nothing else is true wealth”.

 

Dear youngsters,

Today, I expect you to redeem our past stature.

As we aspire to become Vishwa Guru once again, we shall have to align our education with the best education pedagogies, teaching methods and techniques in the world, without losing our ethical moorings. 

You are living in very promising times when the technology has opened up new opportunities and avenues for acquiring knowledge. Today On-line courses and study materials are available even on your Smart Phones. You can access almost every information anywhere in the world through internet.

The world has truly become a global village and barriers to knowledge are coming down at a faster pace than before. In this knowledge-driven digital era, schools must discard rote method of learning and promote innovative and creative thinking. They must encourage students to develop an inquisitive and questioning mind ever eager to learn new things and come out with bright ideas.

Schools must also keep themselves abreast with the rapid developments in technology and align the skill sets of the students in accordance with the requirements.They must also promote entreprenuerial spirit among the students.

In addition to making our education socially relevant and grounded in our cultural values, we need to inculcate a sense of volunteerism among young students. Students should join organisations like NCC, Scouts & Guides, to learn life skills and volunteerism.

The schools should become resource centers for the neighbourhood community service. There should be greater interaction between schools and neighbouring communities.

Students should take up community assignments and voluntary work in neighbourhood communities and adjoining villages, interact with local administration about the local issues and provide innovative solutions for community and rural development.

A large part of India lives in village. Socially- conscious students must stay in villages for a better understanding and proper perpesective on the travails of a village life.

 

Dear youngsters,

It is also essential for you as students to acquire vocational skills, incuding those related to agro-economy. It will help in encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship among young students.

True knowledge is garnered through observation, reading, discussions, reflection, analysis and internalisation and this can only be possible if every school introduces experiential learning embedded with field visits.The curriculum should be oriented to make students think rationally, independently and express cogently.Focus of school education should be on instilling inquisitiveness and curiosity, creativity, critical thinking, communication.

I strongly believe that school education must aim to help students become compassionate and caring human beings, with a sense of empathy.We also need to infuse the spirit of nationalism and patriotism in each child.

Dear students, you must own up the glorious heritage of rich cultural diversity ofthis country. You are also the inheritors of the rich and living linguistic heritage of India. You must enrich this tradition. We must respect and take pride in our mother land and in our mother tongue. Use your Mother Tongue to express yourself creatively and enrich its literature.

I am happy that today Sports provide a promising career opportunity to our youth. It not only trains your mind and body but also inculcates the spirit of teamwork and leadership. Along with your studies, you must also pursue and excel in sports.

 

Young Friends,

May all of you realize your dreams and achieve success in every endeavor you undertake. I would also like to compliment and congratulate the teachers and parents for the achievements of the students.

 

JAI Hind!”

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had telephonic conversations with the President and Prime Minister of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and conveyed heartfelt condolences on his own behalf and on behalf of all Indians at the loss of over one hundred and fifty innocent lives in today’s terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka.

Prime Minister Modi condemned in the strongest terms the serial terrorist attacks, perpetrated at sites including religious places and during a religious festival. Terming them as cold-blooded and pre-planned barbaric acts, he pointed out that these attacks were another grim reminder of the most serious challenge posed to the entire humanity by terrorism in our region and the entire world.

Prime Minister renewed the offer of all possible help and assistance to Sri Lanka for ensuring its security against the challenges such as those posed by terrorism.

He also wished the injured speedy recovery and offered all required assistance for their treatment.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved ongoing GSLV continuation programme Phase-4 consisting of five GSLV flights during the period 2021-2024.

The GSLV Programme - Phase 4 will enable the launch of 2 tonne class of satellites for Geo-imaging, Navigation, Data Relay Communication and Space Sciences.  

 

Financial implications:

The total fund requirement is Rs. 2729.13 Crores and includes the cost of five GSLV vehicles, essential facility augmentation, Programme Management, and Launch Campaign along with the additional funds required for meeting the scope of the ongoing GSLV Continuation Programme.

 

Benefits:

The GSLV Continuation Programme - Phase 4 will meet the launch requirement of satellites for providing critical Satellite Navigation Services, Data Relay Communication for supporting the Indian Human spaceflight programme and the next interplanetary mission to Mars. This will also ensure the continuity of production in Indian industry.

 

Implementation Strategy and targets:

The GSLV Continuation Programme - Phase 4 will meet the demand for the launch of satellites at a frequency up to two launches per year, with maximal participation by the Indian industry. All the operational flights would be completed during the period 2021-24.

 

Major impact:

The operationalization of GSLV has made the country self-reliant in the launching capability of 2 tonne class of satellites for communication & meteorological satellites. The GSLV Continuation Programme will sustain & strengthen the capability and self-reliance in the launching of similar satellites for national requirements including next generation navigation satellites, data relay communication satellites and interplanetary missions.

 

Background:

GSLV has enabled independent access to space for 2 tonne class of satellites to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). One of the very significant outcomes of the GSLV Continuation Programme is the mastering of the highly complex cryogenic propulsion technology, which is an essential technological capability to launch communication satellites to GTO. This has also paved the way for the development of a high thrust Cryogenic engine & stage for the next generation launch vehicle i.e. GSLV Mk-lll.   

 

With the recent successful launch of GSLV-F11 on 19th December 2018, GSLV has successfully orbited 10 national satellites. GSLV with the indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage has established itself as a reliable launch vehicle for communication, navigation and meteorological satellites and also to undertake future interplanetary missions.

 

GSLV Continuation Programme was initially sanctioned in 2003, and two phases have been completed and the third phase is in progress and expected to be completed by Q4 of 2020-21.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved ongoing GSLV continuation programme Phase-4 consisting of five GSLV flights during the period 2021-2024.

The GSLV Programme - Phase 4 will enable the launch of 2 tonne class of satellites for Geo-imaging, Navigation, Data Relay Communication and Space Sciences.  

 

Financial implications:

The total fund requirement is Rs. 2729.13 Crores and includes the cost of five GSLV vehicles, essential facility augmentation, Programme Management, and Launch Campaign along with the additional funds required for meeting the scope of the ongoing GSLV Continuation Programme.

 

Benefits:

The GSLV Continuation Programme - Phase 4 will meet the launch requirement of satellites for providing critical Satellite Navigation Services, Data Relay Communication for supporting the Indian Human spaceflight programme and the next interplanetary mission to Mars. This will also ensure the continuity of production in Indian industry.

 

Implementation Strategy and targets:

The GSLV Continuation Programme - Phase 4 will meet the demand for the launch of satellites at a frequency up to two launches per year, with maximal participation by the Indian industry. All the operational flights would be completed during the period 2021-24.

 

Major impact:

The operationalization of GSLV has made the country self-reliant in the launching capability of 2 tonne class of satellites for communication & meteorological satellites. The GSLV Continuation Programme will sustain & strengthen the capability and self-reliance in the launching of similar satellites for national requirements including next generation navigation satellites, data relay communication satellites and interplanetary missions.

 

Background:

GSLV has enabled independent access to space for 2 tonne class of satellites to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). One of the very significant outcomes of the GSLV Continuation Programme is the mastering of the highly complex cryogenic propulsion technology, which is an essential technological capability to launch communication satellites to GTO. This has also paved the way for the development of a high thrust Cryogenic engine & stage for the next generation launch vehicle i.e. GSLV Mk-lll.   

 

With the recent successful launch of GSLV-F11 on 19th December 2018, GSLV has successfully orbited 10 national satellites. GSLV with the indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage has established itself as a reliable launch vehicle for communication, navigation and meteorological satellites and also to undertake future interplanetary missions.

 

GSLV Continuation Programme was initially sanctioned in 2003, and two phases have been completed and the third phase is in progress and expected to be completed by Q4 of 2020-21.

                India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C45) today successfully launched EMISAT and 28 international customer satellites from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR in Sriharikota. This flight marked the first mission of PSLV-QL, a new variant of PSLV with four strap-on motors. 

PSLV-C45 lifted off at 9:27 Hrs (IST) from the Second Launch Pad and injected India’s EMISAT into a 748 km sun-synchronous polar orbit, 17 minutes and 12 seconds after liftoff. After separation, the two solar arrays of EMISAT were deployed automatically and the ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru assumed control of the satellite. In the coming days, the satellite will be brought to its final operational configuration. 



Following the separation of EMISAT, the vehicle’s fourth stage engines were restarted twice to place the 28 international customer satellites precisely into a sun-synchronous orbit of 504 km height. The last customer satellite was placed into its designated orbit 1 hour and 55 minutes after lift-off. 

About 3 hours after lift-off, the fourth stage (PS4) of the vehicle was moved to a lower circular orbit of 485 km after two restarts to establish it as an orbital platform for carrying out experiments with its three payloads. 

EMISAT is a satellite built around ISRO’s Mini Satellite-2 bus weighing about 436 kg. The satellite is intended for electromagnetic spectrum measurement. 



The 28 international customer satellites, together weighing about 220 kg, are from four countries, namely, Lithuania (2), Spain (1), Switzerland (1) and USA (24). These foreign satellites were launched as part of commercial arrangements. 

The payloads carried by PS4 are Automatic Identification System from ISRO, Automatic Packet Repeating System from AMSAT, India and Advanced Retarding Potential Analyzer for ionospheric studies from Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. 

ISRO Chairman Dr K Sivan congratulated the launch vehicle and satellite teams involved in the mission.

 “Today’s PSLV mission was unique in several ways. It was a four strap-on new variant, the vehicle achieved three different orbits and for the first the PS4 stage is powered by solar panels,” Dr Sivan said. He added that a new PSLV team executed today’s mission. 

Dr Sivan also placed on record the significant involvement of the industry in this mission. 

So far, PSLV has launched 46 national satellites, 10 satellites built by students from Indian Universities and 297 international customer satellites, including the satellites launched today. 

In its next mission, PSLV-C46 will launch RISAT-2B in May 2019.

                The Ministry of Panchayati Raj including its Secretary, Shri Rahul Bhatnagar and senior officials made a presentation to the Chairman of 15th Finance Commission, Shri N.K. Singh, its Members and senior officials of the Commission. 

It may be noted that Article 280 (3) (bb) of the Constitution specifies that the measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a State to supplement the  resources  of  the Panchayats in the State should be on the basis of the recommendations made by the Finance Commission.  

Amongst several proposals to the Finance Commission, the Ministry has proposed an allocation of Rs. 10,00,000 crores to Panchayats by the 15th Finance Commission which is a hike of 399 per cent from that given by the 14th Finance Commission.  

The meeting discussed in detail the proposals of the Ministry which included:


	Allocations to different categories of Panchayats.
	Modification in modality for provision of Performance Grant.
	Allocation of  funds to non-part IX areas/ DPs & IPs and UT Panchayats.
	Sustainable Development Goals linked to activities other than construction.
	Need for increased adoption of Digital Technology by the Panchayats.
	Augmentation of Own Source Revenue- Mechanism to be developed by State Govt.


 

Both the Ministry and the Commission agreed to the view that all three tiers of Panchayati Raj Institutions should receive fund devolution, and the proportionality should be within a specified band.

The Commission will go through all the proposals which shall also be part of the Memorandum of the Central Government to the Commission – for the purpose of making its final recommendations.

                The 2nd meeting of the 15th Finance Commission with the NITI Aayog was held here today.  The Aayog including  its Vice Chairman Dr. Rajeev Kumar,  Members, CEO and other Senior Officials,  interacted with the Finance Commission  including Chairman Shri N.K. Singh, Members and Senior Officials. 

The NITI Aayog put forth suggestions for the 15th Finance Commission and made a case for award of  Performance Based Grants   for States /Sectors.  While observing that richer states grew faster than poorer states, the NITI Aayog made suggestions to the Commission on transfer of resources to States by the Centre.  The Aayog also listed out certain possible indicators for the consideration of the Commission, its  made recommendations on Innovation and Transformation funds as  well as on Medium Term Expenditure Framework.  

Appreciating the suggestions of the Aayog, Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh said there were concrete new thoughts and Commission would certainly examine the recommendations thoroughly.  The Chairman added that since NITI Aayog was an important and integral part of the Central Government, its recommendations must be part of the Central Government Memorandum to the Finance Commission.   

The Members also exchanged views on the issues raised by the Aayog and discussed relevant issues like the Centrally Sponsored Schemes – which have now been made Co-terminus with the award  period of the respective Finance Commission, conditionality/lack-of-conditionality of the horizontal, vertically and sector specific, and striking balance between performance grants and basic grants.

                The 15th Finance Commission today held a high level roundtable on ‘Fiscal Relations across levels of government’.  It was moderated by Shri N. K. Singh, Chairman of the Commission. The roundtable is being organised in partnership with the World Bank, OECD and ADB.  This is the culmination of significant works that all the three organizations  have undertaken for the FC.

Addressing the gathering the Chairman set the tone of the discussions by briefly elaborating on the four technical sessions of the meeting:

o   Sub-national debt

o   Transfer design incentives and fiscal equalization.

o   Sub-national budget and Public financial management system, and

o   Finances of third-tier of Government.

Earlier, the Commission had held separate workshops with the OECD in April, 2018 and the World Bank in July, 2018 to discuss the initial thoughts and country experiences on the issues related to fiscal federalism and inter-governmental transfers. Today’s roundtable is a concluding session of the work being done by the World Bank, OECD and ADB for the Commission.  The discussions were about the findings coming out of the research work and analysis done by their teams.

 

Sub-national debt, fiscal rules and sustainability

·        One of the Terms of Reference made to this Finance Commission is to review the current level of debt of the Union and the States and recommend a fiscal consolidation roadmap for sound fiscal management.

·        As per the amended FRBM Act, the Central Government shall take appropriate steps to ensure that:

o   The general government debt does not exceed 60%;

o   The Central Government debt does not exceed 40% of GDP by the end of FY 2024-25.

·        The Central Government debt is estimated at 48.9 per cent as a percentage of GDP for 2018-19.  It is expected that Central Government liabilities will come down to 47.3 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 (As per Budget 2019-2020).

             

·        The outstanding liabilities of the State Governments stands at 23.4 per cent of GSDP at end-March 2017, with a range of 46.3 per cent in Punjab and 15.1 per cent in Chhattisgarh (as the RBI Study on State Budgets).

·        These developments have posed an important and challenging task for the Commission to arrive at a roadmap for Commission’s award period from 2020 to 2025.

·        Today’s discussions focused on:

o   What should the distribution of this 60% be between centre and states, given the current trends in their debts.

o   How to arrive at the inter se distribution of aggregate state debt between states.

Intergovernmental transfer design, incentives and fiscal equalization

·        Addressing vertical and horizontal imbalance in the fiscal resources between Union and States is one of the major tasks of the Commission.

·        While designing formula-based transfers to sub-national governments, equalization is one of the important considerations.

·        In this context; the roundtable discussed the options available to design an equalization scheme for the Indian federation, given the constraints of data on unit cost of service delivery and on the taxable potential of the Centre States and

·        The Commission’s Terms of Reference requires it to recommend performance-based incentives to states.  Some of the items in this indicative list are efforts on GST, population control, increasing capital expenditure, implementation of flagship programs, etc.  The meeting discussed –

o   Whether it should be incentive for prospective performance or rewards for past accomplishments

o   The need for balance between equity and efficiency, considering that the better-off States will generally score better in efficiency consideration.

·        International experiences of related cases were also discussed.

Public Financial Management

·        Reforms in PFM systems are a continuous process. Previous Finance Commissions recommended on various aspects of PFM systems of both Union and States with focus on budgetary and accounting processes, financial reporting, etc.

·        Pace of implementation of such reforms have been slow. Possible causes  may be lack of institutional framework to operationalize and implement these recommendations either at Union level or State level, and others likely reasons were discussed.

Revenue generation in third-tier of government

            The discussions centered around how to make the 3rd tier self sufficient specially now when the GST has subsumed many taxes which earlier used to generate revenue for them.

·        Raising own revenue by the third tier of the government is a serious concern for India’s decentralised administrative structure.

·        One of the major sources of raising revenue is property taxation by local bodies.

·        Some local bodies have attempted different models to streamline and systematize property collection within their jurisdiction.  However, very few have been successful in improving revenue collection through property taxes.

·        The reforms required in this field, global practices, ways to help local governments to raise their own revenue through the scheme of devolution, grants, and others were discussed.

                The Election Commission of India made a recommendation to the Hon’ble President of India, under Article 324 of the Constitution read with Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, to rescind the Election to 8-Vellore Parliamentary Constituency, Tamil Nadu vide its proceedings no.464/ECI/LET/TERR/TN/SS-I/2019 dated 14.4.2019.

The decision of the ECIto make this recommendation was based on detection of  a systematic design to influence voters in 8- Vellore Parliamentary Constituency during the election process. Thereport of the DGIT(Inv.), Chennai, Sh. B. Murali Kumar, dated 5th of April 2019, details the search and seizure operations u/s 132 of the I.T. Act carried out on 29th and 30th of March, 2019 at the residence of Sh. Durai Murugan, MLA and Treasurer of DMK Party and Sh. Kathir Anand, s/o Sh. Durai Murugan and contesting candidate for Vellore Parliamentary Constituency and at Kingston medical College, run by the Durai Murugan Educational Trust. The search team observed that evidently there was prior rummaging of the premises and removal of material including the control panel of the CCTV as well as the hard disks of the computers. Further discreet surveillance resulted in the confirmation that a large amount of cash and other incriminating material had indeed been shifted out of the college premises while the teams were being denied entry.

Further as per DGIT report, based on the intelligence gathered during the discreet surveillance, certain premises of close associates of the candidate Shri Kathir Anand and their relatives were identified and fresh searches u/s 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, at Katapadi Taluk, Vellore District were initiated on 01.04.2019 at the residence of Sh. Damodaran, brother in law of Sh.Srinivasan, a DMK functionary.  The search operations of the Income Tax Department on 1.4.2019 yielded a total cash seizure of Rs.11.48 Crores, most of which was packed in plastic packets with ward wise details. In addition, unused labels, loose sheets with details of ward-wise breakup of voters and documents related to Kingston Engineering College were found from the residence of Sh. Damodaran. Sh.Srinivasan claimed the ownership of Rs.11.48 Crores and in his statement recorded u/s 131 of IT Act stated that the cash was meant to influence voters in favour of DMK’s candidate. The fact that the claimant does not have any explained source of income and that the documents found with the cash pertain to an institution run by the family of the DMK candidate lays bare the nexus between the candidate and the sums so found.

The Special Expenditure Observer, Ms. Madhu Mahajan, filed a report on 8.4.2019 stating that the searches had unearthed a systematic design to influence voters through inducements and that such activities come under the ambit of  “corrupt practices” as per Section 123 of the RP Act, 1951.The Special Expenditure Observer was of the opinion that the situation is not conducive for the conduct of free and fair elections.

The CEO Tamil Nadu filed his report on the 12.4.2019, wherein he has stated that the cash seizure of Rs. 11.48 Cr. along with evidence in the form of computer printouts detailing proposed assembly segment, ward and booth wise money distribution suggests a clear-cut pattern and design to induce the electors at a large scale across the Vellore Parliamentary Constituency. This organised way of inducement of voters had vitiated the electoral environment which was now not conducive for conducting inducement free, ethical election in Vellore Parliamentary Constituency at this juncture.

After taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances of the present case, the Commission was fully satisfied that the current electoral process in the said 8-Vellore Parliamentary Constituency in Tamil Nadu has been seriously vitiated on account of the above-mentioned unlawful activities on behalf of the candidate, Sh. Kathir Anand, and some members/ workers of the political party in question. In the Commission’s considered opinion, allowing the current electoral process to proceed and conducting the poll in the constituency on 18thApril, 2019, as scheduled, in such a vitiated atmosphere would have severely jeopardised the conduct of free and fair election in the said 8-Vellore Parliamentary Constituency.

The Hon’ble President, accepting the recommendation of the Election Commission of India, made in this regard, is pleased to partially rescind Notification No.1389(E) dt.19th March 2019 in so far as it relates to calling upon the said 8-Vellore Parliamentary Constituency in Tamil Nadu to elect a member to the Lok Sabha.

                As per available data till now, the Voter Turnout Percentage from eighteen States and two Union Territories that went to Polls on 11th April 2019, in the First phase of  General Elections to Lok Sabha 2019, has recorded a figure of 69.43%. This percentage is still likely to go up as at the time of compilation, data from some remaining polling parties from remote locations was yet to be consolidated. 

It may be recalled that in Phase I, 91 Parliamentary Constituencies from States of Andhra Pradesh (25/25 PCs), Arunachal Pradesh (2/2 PCs), Assam (5/14PCs), Bihar (4/40 PCS), Chhattisgarh (1/11 PCs), Jammu & Kashmir (2/6 PCs), Maharashtra (7/48PCs), Manipur (1/2 PCs), Meghalaya (2/2PCs), Mizoram (1/1 PC), Nagaland (1/1 PC), Odisha (4/21 PCs), Sikkim (1/1 PC), Telangana (17/17 PCs), Tripura (1/2 PCs) Uttar Pradesh (8/80PCs), Uttarakhand (5/5 PCs), West Bengal (2/42 PCs) as also Andaman & Nicobar Islands (1/1 PC) and Lakshadweep (1/1 PC) went to Polls. 

            Out of a total of 13,16,22,586 General Electors from these Constituencies, 9,13,79,409 electors (comprising 4,64,30,614 Male Electors, 4,49,20,571 Female electors and 1395 electors from Third Gender) cast their votes. 

Thus as on date a total of 69.43% voter turnout percentage was recorded across these 18 States and 2 UTs. The top five voter turnout percentage has been  - 84.96 % from Lakshadweep; 83.79% from West Bengal PCs of Alipurduar and Coochbehar; 83.26% from Tripura West PC; 83.12%  from Nagaland; 82.82% from II Outer Manipur (ST) PC of Manipur though some polling parties were yet to contribute their figures to the data. 

Simultaneously polling was also conducted on 11th April 2019 for 175 Assembly constituencies of Andhra Pradesh; 60 ACs of Arunachal Pradesh; 28 of the 147 Assembly Constituencies of Odisha and 32 ACs of Sikkim. Across 295 ACs, a voter turnout percentage of 77.38% has been recorded as yet though there could be slight variation in this figure by the time of final computing.

The detailed datasheet available as yet is attached herewith for ready reference. 

In 2014 General Elections to the 16th Lok Sabha, a final voter turnout percentage of 66.44% was reported across all the nine phases of polling.

                LokSabha elections 2019 are going to see the enthusiasm of various segments of voters including service voters. As per the data sourced from the ECI website, this year a total of 16,62,993 service voters are enrolled in the country, in comparison to the figure of 13,27,627 in 2014. While States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan have larger number of service voters, Uttarakhand has also got around 88,600 services voters. Garhwal parliamentary constituency has maximum number of service voter among all the five constituencies of the State, since 2004 till date.This figure becomes significant, considering the population of the State.The increase in number of service voters has been due to Election Commission’s all out efforts to maximise the registration of service electors during summary revision 2019 and active cooperation of the services/departments concerned and greater participation of service personnel.

In cases of close contests, service voters play crucial and decisive role. Service voter are those who have service qualification. They include member of Armed Forces of the Union of India, members of Armed Police forces of the States serving outside that state and persons employed under Government of India on posts outside India. As per existing arrangements, members of India Army, Navy and Air force, Boarder Road Organisation, BSF, ITBP, Assam Rifles, NSG, CRPF, CISF and SSB are eligible to be registered as service voters.

A Service Voter can cast his/her vote by proxy also. They may appoint (By applying to returning officer in Form 13 F available at the website of ECI) any person as his/her proxy to cast vote on his/her behalf in his/her at the polling station. Proxy should be a registered voter of that constituency.

A Service Portal has also been created for the help of Service Voters. More information can be obtained from www.servicevoter.nic.in.

                The Election Commission of India  has issued an advisory  to all the media (electronic and print) to refrain from telecasting/publishing programmes which in any way whatsoever predict the results of the elections during the prohibited period under 126A to ensure free, fair and transparent election.

            The Commission is of the view that prediction of results of elections in any form or manner by way of predictions etc. by Astrologers, Tarot Readers, Political Analysts or by any persons during the prohibited period is violation of the spirit of Section 126A which aims to prevent the electors of constituencies still going to polls from being influenced in their voting by such predictions about the prospects of the various political parties.

            All the media (Electronic and Print) are advised not to publish/publicize any such article/programme related to the dissemination of results, during the prohibited period i.e. between 7.00 AM on 11.04.2019 (Thursday) and upto 6.30 PM on 19.05.2019 (Sunday) in the current General Elections to the Lok Sabha and State legislative assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha & Sikkim, 2019 and the Assembly bye-elections being held in several states.

The year witnessed a four-fold increase in total value of transactions on the portal and doubling of number of sellers in the marketplace. There has also been an overall growth in other dimensions like number of categories, products and buyers.Despite such phenomenal growth in transactions, average rejection rate of supplies remained below one percent, which is proof of high quality of products/services offered on the portal.

	products and services offered through GeM.
	Traffic on GeM website has increased by 50% in FY 2018-19 Vs. 2017-18


 

 

During the year, GeM was awarded Digital India Platinum Award for ‘Exemplary Online Service’ by the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY). It was also nominated for the prestigious UN-ITU WSIS. GeM had taken up some special initiatives to spread awareness, train prospective users and promote inclusiveness in the marketplace. One such mega initiative was National Mission on GeM, organized during the months of September-October 2018. Launched on 5th September 2018, the Mission witnessed 315 capacity building exercises across 187 districts of 31 states/UTs.

 

Apart from the States, UT, Central Ministries and CPSU events, 18 dedicated theme-based events, which included technology architecture, services, credit facilities, legal framework, localization etc. were held to steer the future roadmap for GeM and strategize exponential growth.As a part of inclusive agenda, another special initiative was launched to enable Women Entrepreneurs and Women led Self Help Groups to showcase and sell their products on GeM. The initiative is aptly named as ‘Womaniya’.

 

Another programme like SWAYATT- an initiative to promote Start-ups, Women and Youth Advantage Through e-Transactions, was launched in February 2019.In association with Start -up India, GeM Start-up Runway has been initiated to facilitate Start-ups in selling innovative products and services to government buyers.

 

Since its inception on 9th August 2016,GeM has transformed public procurement in the country by leveraging technology and making procurement contactless, paperless, and cashless. GeM facilitates procurement at the right price, right quality and right quantity in a transparent and efficient manner. The platform reduces manual process inefficiencies and human interventions in procurement and enables increased coverage, access, and efficiency of faceless standardised public procurement.

Both Sides agreed that trade was far below the potential and there was a need to step up their cooperation to enlarge the trade basket and increase the bilateral trade and investment. There is trade deficit on the part of Indian Side and both Sides agreed to find out the modalities to reduce it further. 

 

Cooperation in Enhancing the Bilateral Trade

India and Ukraine have identified potential sectors where both Sides   could engage in bilateral trade since presently the share of trade between both Sides is quite low as compared to total trade made with the rest of the World. Both Sides agreed to share the list of products which they would like to trade. 

Both Sides should participate in the major fairs/exhibitions in the identified potential sectors. Both Sides agreed to share the details of the fairs / exhibitions to each other sufficiently in advance to ensure participation. 

In order to promote trade, both Sides should share the mandatory inspections’ / regulations’ requirement to be fulfilled at the time of exporting / importing of any product so that any delay related to such inspection could be reduced and it will also create a positive atmosphere for doing business. 

 

Indian Side informed about various Export Promotion Councils and other export related institutions from where one can get the details of exporters /importers and agreed to share the list of such institutions.

	Exchange of Business delegations
	Consultancy in development of SMEs in Ukraine


Ukrainian Side informed  regarding the  approval by the  Government of the Strategy for the development of Small and Medium businesses for the period up to 2020.

Cooperation in Leather, Tobacco, Gems and Jewellery and Tea Sectors

Leather Sector


	Side stated that India’s market share in Ukraine’s imports of leather goods and footwear is less than 1% and this is mainly due to the high rates of import duty in Ukraine. Indian Side requested Ukrainian Side to consider bringing down the import duties to a uniform level of 5% for leather goods for footwear. 


 

Tobacco Sector

Indian Side informed Ukrainian Side that India is a large producer of tobacco and tobacco products and requested Ukrainian Side for considering imports of tobacco and tobacco products as the Ukraine’s imports of tobacco and tobacco products range from 60,000 to 79,000 MT.

 

Gems and Jewellery Sector 

The duty structure for gems and jewellery products is on higher side in Ukraine, including a VAT of 20%, total duty for gold jewellery and cut & polished diamonds is around 30%. Indian Side requested Ukrainian Side for duty reduction on gold jewellery and cut & polished diamonds. 

 

Tea Sector

Indian Side stated that Ukraine is an important market destination for tea and requested Ukrainian Side for removal of duty of 10% CIF value on packed teas.

Significant changes have been made in the FDI policy regime in recent times to ensure that India remains increasingly attractive and investor-friendly. In the light of the wide-ranging opportunities and recent initiatives like Make in India, Ease of Doing Business, Start-up India and liberal FDI regime, there is lot of potential for FDI from Ukraine to India. Indian industry is committed to exploring the untapped potential and expanding economic partnership.

Both Sides discussed the application of Trade Defence Instruments ensuring  compliance with relevant provisions of WTO Agreements. 

 

Ukrainian Side expressed a deep concern that Ukraine should prove its market economy status in each anti-dumping investigation, taking into account the commitment to grant the market economy status to Ukraine made by the Indian Side during the Fifth and Sixth sessions of the Ukrainian – Indian Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological, Industrial and Cultural Cooperation. 

 

Given that Ukrainian Side has already provided the Indian competent authority with all details on the market economy status of Ukraine, including evidence that other WTO Members treat Ukraine as a market economy country. 

 

Indian Side noted the concern of the Ukrainian Side and further  informed that the investigation into the anti-dumping issues are quasi-judicial in nature  and in this  fair and transparent opportunity is provided to all the stakeholders in accordance with the WTO provisions/guidelines to defend their case.

Both Sides intend to continue their joint activities aimed at further expanding their bilateral trade in agricultural and food products and agreed to hold bilateral consultations on possible approaches to liberalization of trade in agricultural and food products.

Considering the Market potential in Ukraine, Indian Side expressed interest in popularizing and promoting its shrimp products and also supplying of seed of Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).

 

Since the high level of tariff protection reduces the prospects of launching systematic mutual trade in processed food products, Indian Side requested Ukrainian Side to provide the detailed list of items/tariff lines etc. on which Ukraine seeks reduction in tariff.

 

Ukrainian Side emphasized the attention to a number of topical issues in the field of agriculture, in particular with regard to trade in plant products (fumigation requirements of the Indian Party for imported cargoes), which should be considered in detail within the framework of the profile Working Group, as well as at the level of the Intergovernmental Ukrainian-Indian Commission.

                In a major success, the IEPF Authority has been able to enforce The Peerless General Finance and Investment Company Limited to transfer deposits worth about Rs 1514 Cr to IEPF. This depositor’s money was pending with the company for the last 15 years.  The matter came to the notice of the Authority recently and within a short time due to the proactive action of the Authority the said sum has now been transferred to IEPF. This amount was taken by the company by issuing about 1.49 Cr Deposit Certificates and include more than 1 Cr individual investors. The data submitted by company reveals that 50.77 percent of the total amount was taken in form of deposit certificates of value of Rs. 2000 or less. Number wise such certificates form 85.32 percent of total number of certificates issued. The majority of these investors are common citizens belonging to lower and middle income group including daily wage earners etc. Geographically, the investors involved belong to 30 states and Union territories of the Country. Majority of the investors belong to the state of West Bengal.

 

 



                     85% of total 1.4 Cr Deposits have been taken as Rs 2000 or less

 

The IEPF Authority is in the process of commissioning an online facility to collect primary information directly from retail investors about the deposits which have matured and are still pending with various entities for repayment or payment of interests. The online report will capture only essential fields with various dropdown options. The Authority may take various steps to make all such companies and other entities comply with provisions of Companies Act or other allied related legal provisions. 

The Authority has also acted against companies that have transferred the unpaid dividend amount to IEPF but have failed to transfer shares in accordance with section 124(6) of the Act. In some other cases, the companies are showing unclaimed and unpaid amounts in their Balance Sheets but have not transferred such amounts to IEPF even after seven years. Based on above, the authority has issued more than 4000 notices to the companies under section 206(4) of the Act for calling information. It has been noticed that there are many companies including NBFC companies which have neither refunded these amounts back to their entitled investors nor have transferred such amounts to IEPF even after expiry of the period of seven years.

                Contracts for Sixteen Anti Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Craft (ASW SWC) ships have been signed for construction of eight ships each from M/s CSL, Kochi and GRSE, Kolkata respectively. delivery of ships is scheduled to commence from October 22, with two ships per year subsequently, by each shipyard. 

In view of India's vast coastline of 7516.6 kilometer with 12 Major ports, 184 minor ports and 1197 Island territories, coastal surveillance for ASW operations is considered critical. 

Induction of these specialised ships with lower draught, would significantly enhance coastal shallow water Anti Submarine Warfare capability of the Indian Navy with improved performance of weapons, censors, hall mounted and towed Sonars. 

Equipped with state-of-art indigenous Integrated Platform Management Systems, Propulsion, auxiliary, and PGD Machinery, these ships are capable of subsurface surveillance of coastal waters and lying of mines, making them a potent platform and adding another milestone to the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government of India

                Ministry of Defence has awarded Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Limited (GRSE)contract to build eight Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Crafts (ASWSWCs) for Indian Navy. The contract worth Rs. 6,311.32 crore was signed today by Joint Secretary & Acquisition Manager (Maritime Systems) Shri Ravi Kant on behalf of Ministry of Defence and Shri S S Dogra, Director (Finance), on behalf of GRSE, in New Delhi.  

It may be noted that the RFP was issued by Indian Navy to DPSU Shipyards and Indian Private Shipyards in April 2014, withGRSE emerging as the successful bidderfor design, construction and supply of the eightASWSWCs. The 1st ship is to be delivered within 42 months from contract signing date and subsequent balance ships delivery schedule will be two ships per year. The project completion time is 84 months from today. The GRSE is currently handling major projects to make three Stealth Frigates for Indian Navy under P17A Project, ASW Corvettes for Indian Navy, LCUs for Indian Navy, four Survey Vessels (Large) for Indian Navy, FPVs for Indian Coast Guard, etc.

The GRSE has been a pioneer warship builder of the nation having delivered the highest number of warships till date since its inception as a DPSU in 1960. The 100 warships built by GRSE so far ranges from Advanced Frigates to Anti-Submarine Warfare Corvettes to Fleet Tankers, Fast Attack Crafts, etc. with the Shipyard having many firsts to its credit in terms of Innovation and Design. The present Project will further consolidate GRSE’s position as a unique shipyard with all round capability to design and build ASWSWC warships with state-of-the-art technology. 

These Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Crafts are designed for a deep displacement of 750 tons, speed of 25 knots and complement of 57 and capable of full-scale sub surface surveillance of coastal waters, SAU and Coordinated ASW operations with Aircraft. In addition, the vessels shall have the capability to interdict/ destroy sub surface targets in coastal waters. These can also be deployed for Search and Rescue by day and night in coastal areas. In their secondary role, these will be capable to prosecute intruding aircraft, and lay mines in the sea bed.

The vessels are equipped with highly advanced state-of-the-art integrated platform management systems including Propulsion Machinery, Auxiliary Machinery, Power Generation and Distribution Machinery and Damage Control Machinery, etc.These warships will be built as per Classification Society Rules and Naval Ship Regulations and will conform to latest Marine Pollution Standards of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).

The design and construction of these ships at GRSE is another significant milestone in the ‘Make In India’ Initiative of the Government of India.

                The first edition of this years’ bi-annual Naval Commanders’ Conference which commenced on 23 Apr 19, concluded on 25 Apr 19 after three days of fruitful deliberations. 

            The Hon’ble RM addressed Naval Commanders on 23 Apr 19 and complimented the Indian Navy for maintaining a high operational tempo and its ability to not only safeguard India’s interest in the maritime domain but also coerce an adversary into submission as was evident during the recent standoff. She appreciated Navy’s efforts in the area of indigenisation, self-reliance and support to the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government. She expressed happiness at the numerous initiatives taken to achieve ‘Digital Navy’ vision in line with the Government’s ‘Digital India Programme’. 

            During the interaction, the Hon’ble RM reviewed the combat readiness, pace of modernisation and progress of various acquisition and infrastructure related cases. While praising the Indian Navy’s foreign cooperation efforts to support the Navies in the region, she urged the Naval Commanders to optimally utilise available resources to build a strong Navy that is ready and vigilant to counter any challenge that may emerge in the maritime domain.

            Chairing the conference, the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba addressed the Commanders on various important issues pertaining to operational readiness, capability enhancement, maintenance, op logistics, infrastructure development and human resource management. 

             ‘Functional Reorganisation of Indian Navy towards improving Operational efficiency’ and ‘Optimal Manning’ formed the core of discussions towards finalising the long term road map of the Navy. In keeping with the Navy’s ethos of harnessing niche technologies, concrete plans to incorporate ‘Big Data Analytics’ and ‘Artificial Intelligence’ for solutions in the domains of naval combat, convergence of networks/ information, logistics, administration and equipment health monitoring for sustained operation were also discussed.

            The Indian Navy’s sustained prominence as the first responder for HADR and its role as the Net Security Provider in the IOR were reviewed by the Commanders. The Navy’s partnering with many Friendly Foreign Countries for developing comprehensive Maritime Domain Awareness, undertaking concrete steps such as 10th IONS anniversary celebrations at Kochi, concluding numerous defence cooperation agreements related to logistics, training and operations, which are a testimony to its primacy in the sphere of defence diplomacy in the wider Indo Pacific region and beyond were also reviewed during the conference.  

            The next edition of Naval Commanders’ Conference is scheduled in Oct/ Nov later this year.

                IN Ships Kolkata and Shakti entered Qingdao, China to participate in the International Fleet Review (IFR) as part of 70TH Anniversary Celebrations of PLA (Navy) on 21 Apr 19. Entry of IN Ships was marked by firing of 21 gun salute to the Peoples Republic of China. The Ships were welcomed into harbour by officials from PLA (N) North Sea Fleet with live performance of Naval Band as part of Welcome Ceremony. 


The participation of Indian Navy in PLA (N) IFR, for third consecutive time (2009, 2014 and 2019), is a demonstration of the Nation’s commitment to enhance maritime cooperation between the two navies and bolster bonds of friendship between the two Countries. The IN has deployed its finest assets for the IFR with an aim to strengthen existing cooperation, enhance mutual trust, extend interoperability and build greater synergy to address common maritime concerns among participating navies.

During the stay in harbour, activities scheduled include courtesy calls to various dignitaries of PLA(N), naval band performance in the famous MAY 4THSquare and various other functions of IFR including opening ceremony, planning conferences and table top exercise . IN Ships will take part in the parade of naval ships scheduled on 23 Apr which will be reviewed by the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Personnel from IN Ships would also be participating in various sporting events, professional exchanges with participating navies and ship visit by PLA (Navy) personnel and local populace. The Indian Ambassador to China, Shri Vikram Misri, will also host a reception onboard INS Kolkata for dignitaries, officers of PLA (Navy) and delegations participating in the IFR.

The IN Ships had earlier called at Port Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam for a good will visit prior entering Qingdao. The ships are also scheduled to visit Port Busan, South Korea and Singapore on their return journey to India as part of Eastern Fleet Overseas Deployment. The Annual Overseas Deployment to the South China Sea is an important facet of Government of India’s ‘Act East’ policy and Indian Navy’s efforts to “Unite Nations Through the Oceans”, through which India wishes to extend the ‘Bridges of Friendship’ through enhanced cultural, economic and maritime interactions with countries of East and South-East Asia.

                The first edition of Naval Commanders’ Conference of 2019 is scheduled at New Delhi from 23 to 25 April 2019. The conference is the apex forum within the Service for interaction between the Naval Commanders. The Chief of the Naval Staff, with the Commanders-in-Chief, will review major operational, materiel, logistics, HR, training and administrative activities undertaken during the previous six months and deliberate upon the course to be steered in the ensuing six months. 

          The Conference assumes greater significance in the backdrop of Pulwama associated events that have brought country’s defence under sharper focus and will provide the higher naval leadership a forum to discuss the emerging challenges in the maritime domain and fine tune the strategies for responding to the evolving geo-strategic environment.

          The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri is scheduled to address the Naval Commanders on the opening day and interact with them. The conference also serves as a platform for institutionalised interaction of Naval Commanders with senior Government Officials. 

          Interaction with Chiefs of Indian Army and Indian Air Force during the conference would be utilised to analyse the operational environment, deliberate on Tri-Service synergy and readiness to deter and neutralise threats aimed at the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

          The themes of 'Functional Reorganisation of Indian Navy towards improving Operational Efficiency' and 'Optimal Manning' will form the core of discussions towards finalising long term road map for the IN. 

          Discussions are planned on acquisition of new capabilities, harnessing niche technologies like 'Big Data Analytics' and 'Artificial Intelligence' for solutions in the domains of naval combat, convergence of networks/ information, logistics, administration and equipment health monitoring for sustained operations.

          In keeping with the expectation of IN being the Net Security Provider in the IOR and first responder to any crisis, the forum will also deliberate upon the lessons learnt from the recently concluded HADR operations by the IN and various other maritime security initiatives such as the IFC-IOR.

                The 14 days, 11 members Himalayan Heights Motorcycle Expedition from Leh to Karakoram Pass successfully completed the arduous challenge and was flagged in at Leh today by Lt Gen YK Joshi, General Officer Commanding Fire and Fury Corps. The unprecedented expedition that began on 07 Apr 19 traversed over 1000 Km in the forbidding landscape of Eastern Ladakh, crossing the mighty Khardung La and Chang La passes on the Ladakh Range at altitudes over 17000 ft.​​

​        The expedition team comprised six motorcyclists from the Army Service Corps, a major logistics service of the Indian Army and five riders from Royal Enfield and Himalayan Motorsports Association. To their credit goes the historic landmark of riding to the Karakoram Pass on the Karakoram Range situated at an altitude of 18600 ft, where they reached on    16 Apr 19. Speaking on the occassion at the Karakoram Pass, Lt Gen YK Joshi had complimented the spirited riders on their path breaking achievement.

        Displaying extremely high levels of endurance, physical fitness and mental resilience, the riders have conquered the harsh, under developed terrain and extreme temperatures with their zeal, skill and motivation. The expedition team led by Maj K Renuka includes Maj Bhupesh Rawat, Capt Akshay Joshi, Capt Jabez Philip, Capt Arpit Kapila, Capt Nikita A Nair, Sep Abhijit, Sep Shiv Singh, Sep Deewakar Mishra, Vijay Parmar, Aditya Malaker, Nihal Raheja, and Hema Choudhary. ​In a tribute to the immortal tales of sacrifice during the Kargil War fought in Ladakh in 1999, the expedition mirrored the soldierly attributes of indomitable courage and the steely will to contest seemingly insurmountable odds. Riding from Leh over the Chang La Pass, the expedition travelled across Durbuk, Tangtse, Chongtash, Daulat Beg Oldie, Karakoram Pass, Khalsar and back over the Khardung La Pass.

​        While flagging in the expedition as part of celebrating 20 years of Kargil Vijay Diwas,  Lt Gen YK Joshi, felicitated the team members for their achievement. Recalling the valour exhibited by the nation’s Armed Forces during Operation Vijay, the GOC complimented the young Army riders of the Army Service Corps for their high levels of fitness and tenacity and lauded the members of Royal Enfield and Himalayan Motorsports Association for their contribution to ‘Remember, Rejoice and Renew’ the indomitable spirit of the Indian Army, the 20th Anniversary year of the Kargil Vijay Diwas.

                Admiral Sunil Lanba PVSM, AVSM, ADC Chief of the Naval Staff launched the third ship of Project 15B, Guided Missile Destroyer Imphal, today (20 April 2019) at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, Mumbai. This launch marks yet another significant milestone in the annals of the indigenous warship design and construction programme of India. With a launch weight of 3,037 tonnes, the vessel made its first contact with water at 1220 Hours with full fanfare during the launching ceremony. In keeping with maritime traditions, Smt Reena Lanba, President NWWA, broke a coconut on the ship’s bow and launched the ship, as invocation from the Atharva Veda was being rendered. 

Project 15B ships feature cutting edge advanced technology and are comparable to the best ships of similar class anywhere in the world. These ships have been designed indigenously by the Indian Navy’s Directorate of Naval Design, New Delhi. Each ship spans 163 metres in length and 17.4 metres at beam and displaces 7,300 tonnes. These ships will be propelled by four gas turbines to achieve speed in excess of 30 knots. The P15B destroyers incorporate new design concepts for improved survivability, sea keeping, stealth and manoeuvrability. Enhanced stealth features have been achieved through shaping of hull and use of radar transparent deck fittings which make these ships difficult to detect. P15B ships will be equipped to carry and operate two multiple role helicopters.

            These ships are packed with an array of state-of-the-art weapons and sensors, including multi-functional surveillance radars and vertically launched missile system for long distance engagement of shore, sea-based and air targets. With significant indigenous content, these ships are a true hallmark of self-reliance attained by our country in warship design and shipbuilding, and a shining example of the ‘Make in India’ philosophy.    

Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Guest, Admiral Sunil Lanba commended the synergic partnership of MDL, Indian Navy, DRDO, OFB, BEL, other public sector enterprises and the private industry in ensuring that force levels are made available to meet India’s National strategic maritime objectives. He also congratulated all agencies associated with the milestone.

                IN Ships Kolkata and Shakti are scheduled to arrive Qingdao, China on 21 Apr 19 to participate in the International Fleet Review as part of 70TH Anniversary celebrations of PLA (Navy). International Fleet Review (IFR) is a parade of naval ships, aircraft and submarines, and is organised by nations to promote goodwill, strengthen cooperation and showcase their organisational capabilities. IFR also serves as an ideal platform for world’s navies to showcase their prowess and indigenous ship designing and ship building capabilities in a global/ international arena. The second IFR conducted by India off Visakhapatnam in Feb 2016 saw overwhelming participation of 50 navies with nearly 100 warships.

 

The Indian Navy would be represented in the IFR at Qingdao by indigenously built stealth guided missile destroyer INS Kolkata and fleet support ship INS Shakti. INS Kolkata is equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and sensors to address threats in all dimensions of naval warfare. INS Shakti, a replenishment ship, is one of the largest tankers displacing over 27,000 tonnes and capable of carrying 15,000 tonnes of liquid cargo and over 500 tonnes of solid cargo including victuals and ammunition. The visit of Indian Navy’s most potent destroyer and versatile fleet support ship showcases India’s prowess, reach and sustainability in addition to indigenous ship building capability. 

The harbour stay of IN Ships will be marked by interaction between personnel of participating navies, courtesy calls to various dignitaries of PLA (N) and Government officials, professional exchanges and various sporting events. Ships will be opened for visits by PLA (Navy) personnel and local populace to showcase Indian Navy’s prowess and India’s ship building capability. The ships are likely to sail in the evening of 22 APRIL to participate in the Naval Parade of ships scheduled to be reviewed by the Chinese President Xi Jinping on 23 April.

                In the backdrop of the growing maritime engagement between India and Vietnam, the Indian Navy undertook the second edition of the bilateral maritime exercise between Indian Navy and Vietnam Peoples’ Navy at/ off  Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam from 13 to 16 Apr 19. The maiden edition was conducted from 21 to 26 May 18 at Da Nang, Vietnam. The exercise was undertaken as a part of the ongoing Overseas Deployment of Eastern Fleet ships to South East Asian countries. IN Ships Kolkata under the command of Capt Aditya Hara and Shakti under the command of Capt Sriram Amur participated in the exercise, comprising a harbour and a sea phase.  

The Indian Navy and the Vietnam Peoples’ Navy have traditionally shared good relations. Conduct of the bilateral exercise on an annual basis would give a further fillip to the existing strong bilateral relation between the two countries, which since Sep 16 have been elevated to the level of ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ after the visit of the Hon’ble PM to Vietnam. The Navy to Navy cooperation involves a Composite Training Programme in the fields of Submarine, Aviation and Dockyard training. The two countries have also signed an agreement to exchange White Shipping Information and have a running ‘Information Sharing’ programme. 

The Indian Navy-Vietnam Peoples’ Navy Bilateral Exercise is a significant step in further strengthening mutual confidence and inter-operability as well as sharing best practices between the Indian and the Vietnam Peoples’ Navies.

                The 11 member ‘Himalayan Heights Motorcycle Expedition’ which was flagged off from Karu (Leh) on 07 April 2019 traversed the challenging terrain of Eastern Ladakh, across the Chang La pass and has reached the mighty ‘Karakoram Pass’ situated at an altitude of 18,176 feet on the Karakoram Ranges on 16 April 2019. The joint Motorcycle Expedition which comprises six Indian Army personnel from the Army Service Corps, four from Royal Enfield and one from Himalayan Motorsports Association is being undertaken in the year when the Fire & Fury Corps is celebrating 20th Anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas, which marks the victory of the Indian Armed Forces over Pakistan in 1999.         

This unprecedented feat over hazardous and unforgiving terrain with temperatures as low as -40C coupled with freezing winds, is a remarkable tribute to the immortal courage and bravery of the Indian Army. In a rare gesture of encouragement for the expedition members, Lt Gen YK Joshi, General Officer Commanding, Fire and Fury Corps reached the Karakoram Pass to meet and motivate the riders.​​

Speaking on the occasion, Lt Gen YK Joshi lauded the efforts of the team especially the two Women Officers from the Army Service Corps and the woman member of the Royal Enfield team who proved equal in strength, skill and spirit to the other members.

The Ladakh region was witness to the unparalleled valour, indomitable courage and immortal tales of sacrifice during the Kargil War in 1999. The Himalayan Heights Expedition undertaken by the Army Service Corps, Royal Enfield and Himalayan Motorsports Association demands similar attributes and is a salute to ‘Remember, Rejoice & Renew’ the spirit of fortitude, bravery and adventure of the Indian Army.

                A major catastrophe was averted by the well trained Indian Naval aircrew, when their Chetak helicopter ditched at sea last week.

The helicopter was integral to an Indian Naval Warship operationally deployed in the Arabian Sea.

 



As per reports, the helicopter developed technical failure prior ditching and the crew displayed immense professional prowess and sound training thereby deftly landing the helicopter in the water and successfully egressing from it.

While all three crew members are safe, a Board of Inquiry has been ordered to investigate the cause of the technical failure leading to the loss of the helicopter

                We have seen reports drawing conjectural connection between tax exemption to a private company and procurement of Rafale fighter jets by Government of India. Neither the period of the tax concession nor the subject matter of the concession relate even remotely to the Rafale procurement concluded during the tenure of the present Government. Any connections drawn between the tax issue and the Rafale matter is totally inaccurate, tendentious and is a mischievous attempt to disinform.

                Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM, AVSM, ADC the Chief of the Naval Staff, inaugurated the maiden ‘state-of-the-art’ Virtual Reality Centre (VRC) at the Directorate of Naval Design (Surface Ship Group), today. This centre would provide major boost to the Indigenous warship design capabilities of Indian Navy, providing impetus to self-reliance and greater fillip to warship construction under “Make in India” initiative of the Indian government.

            During his address at inauguration ceremony, Admiral Lanba complimented the Directorate for their untiring efforts, foresight and initiatives to conceptualise design and execute the project. This project will facilitate collaborative design reviews for continuous interaction between the designers and the end users to improve design and ergonomics onboard warships.

            Directorate of Naval Design (Surface Ship Group) had a humble beginning in 1960s and since then has made major contributions towards indigenous warship design capabilities of the Indian Navy improving self-reliance for warship design and construction. The multi-disciplinary team has successfully developed 19 warship designs on which more than 90 platforms have been constructed todate.

                Supreme Court has passed an order dated 10 April 2019 on 36 Rafale Procurement Case.

 

In the Review Petitions, the petitioners have relied upon the documents, some of which could not have been placed in public domain. The Central Government raised an objection that while considering Review Petitions, the said documents may not be considered as they are classified.

 

In the Order passed by the Supreme Court today, the Court has decided to look into the documents also while deciding the Review Petitions. The Review Petitions are pending and are yet to be heard. 

 

The Supreme Court by a well-reasoned judgement and order dated 14 December 2018 had already dismissed the Writ Petitions. 

 

It is reiterated that the petitioners are using documents with the intention to present a selective and incomplete picture of internal secret deliberations on a matter relating to National Security and Defence. The documents presented by the petitioners are failing to bring out how the issues were addressed and resolved and necessary approvals of the competent authorities taken. These are selective and incomplete presentation of the facts and records by the petitioners. 

 

Government had provided the requisite information as desired by the Hon’ble Supreme Court to the Court and also to the petitioners as per directions of the Court and in the manner prescribed by the Court. Government also provided all records and files as required by CAG. The main concern of the Government is relating to availability of sensitive and classified information concerning National Security in the public domain.

                The Battle of Kangla Tongbi, considered one of the fiercest battles of World War II, was fought by Ordnance personnel of 221 Advance Ordnance Depot (AOD) on the night of 6/7 April 1944.  Japanese forces had planned a three pronged offensive to capture Imphal and the surrounding areas.  In their attempt to extend their line of communication to Imphal, the 33rd Japanese Division cut in behind the 17th Indian Division at Tiddim (Mynmar) and establishing themselves firmly on the main Kohima – Manipur highway, started advancing towards Kangla Tongbi.  Here at Kangla Tongbi, a small but determined detachment of 221 AOD put up stiff resistance against the advancing Japanese forces. 

The position of 221 AOD was not at all sound from a tactical point of view.  It was exposed to the enemy from all sides and had to rely on its own combatant manpower for its defence.  Major Boyd, the Deputy Chief of Ordnance Officer (DCOO) was made in charge of the operations for defence of the Depot.  A Suicide squad comprising of Major Boyd, Havildar/ Clerk Store Basant Singh, Conductor Panken and other personnel from the Depot was created. 

On 06 Apr 1944, orders were received to evacuate 4,000 tons of ammunition, armaments and other warlike stores.  On the night of 6/7 Apr 1944, the Japanese mounted a heavy attack on the Depot, rushing downhill into a deep nallah which was used as a covered approach to the Depot.  A very well camouflaged bunker had been sited by the Depot on this approach.  The Bren Gun Section in this bunker having spotted an enemy section within range, opened fire.  This shook the enemy and forced the Japanese to withdraw leaving many dead.  The Bren Gun was manned by none other than Hav/ Clerk Store Basant Singh.     

For this act of gallantry, Major Boyd was awarded the Military Cross (MC), Conductor Panken, the Military Medal (MM) and Hav/ Clerk Store Basant Singh, the Indian Distinguished Service Medal (IDSM).

The Kangla Tongbi War Memorial is a mute testimony to this battle and the unflinching devotion to duty of the Ordnance personnel of  221 AOD, 19 of whom made the supreme sacrifice. It conveys to the world at large that Ordnance personnel, apart from being professional logisticians, are second to none in combat, being equally proficient soldiers, should the occasion demand.  As it commemorate the Platinum Jubilee of this hard fought battle, the spirit of Kangla Tongbi lives eternally in the hearts of all Army Ordnance Corps personnel of the Indian Army and continues to be source of inspiration for all ranks.   

The Platinum Jubilee of the Battle of Kangla Tongbi War was commemorated on 07 Apr 2019 by Army Ordnance Corps at Kangla Tongbi War Memorial near Imphal honouring the valiant brave hearts of Ordnance Personnel of 221 Advance Ordnance Depot who made their supreme sacrifice in the line of duty during the battle of World War-II on the night of 6/ 7 April 1944.

The event commenced with wreath laying by Lt Gen Dalip Singh, VSM, DGOS & Senior Colonel Commandant as the chief guest, Veteran Officers and next of kin of Britishers who participated during the Kangla Tongbi Ops and Descendants of Indian Martyrs. The event was also witnessed by the representatives of the local civil administration.  The locals enthusiastically participated during the complete event. 

Apart from laying wreath at Kangla Tongbi War Memorial, the DGOS & Senior Colonel Commandant, senior dignitaries and next of kin of the Britishers and descendants of Indian Martyrs visited the Kangla Tongbi Childrens Home. To commemorate the occasion and as a matter of charity, the inmates were presented with gifts during the interaction with them.

14 days, 11 bikes and 1 dream expedition, the Himalayan Heights winter bike expedition from Leh to KK Pass will cover over 1,000 km and is likely to qualify for inclusion in the record books. This road route initially used as the Afghan trade route has never been explored by any biker in the world. The expedition is led by Indian Army team comprising riders from Army Service Corps, Royal Enfield and Himalayan Motorsports. 

The Team is ready to brave all odds in the unforgiving terrain and the extreme climate of the region, to complete a motorcycle expedition to Karakoram Pass. In this 20th Anniversary of the Kargil Vijay Diwas, such adventure activities undertaken by brave Army personnel including women officers serve to renew and rekindle the spirit of fortitude, courage and adventure synonymous with the Indian Army.

                A 12 member Indian Army patrol along with a police representative recovered wreckage of a World War II vintage US Air Force aircraft in Roing district of Arunachal Pradesh on 30 Mar 2019. The patrol located the aircraft debris covered by thick undergrowth and buried under five feet of snow. Based on the information received from local trekkers of Lower Dibang district through the police, a special patrol of Army was sent to locate the wreckage in a remote location, 30 kms from Roing. The patrol moved cross country for 30 kilometers in thick jungles and snow covered areas for eight days to trace out the wreckage.  The region had seldom been ventured by anyone in the past and is even obscured from air due to thick foliage. The discovery of the vintage aircraft and other warlike stores will definitely lead to revelation of some historical inputs .

            The third edition of AUSINDEX scheduled from 02 to 14 April 19 would involve exercises in all three dimensions with focus on Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW) and shall be held in three phases.  The harbour phase from 02 to 07 April at Visakhapatnam – ‘the City of Destiny’  shall witness professional interaction in the form of Subject Matter Expert Exchange (SMEE) for sharing best practises, cross deck visits in addition to sporting, social and cultural engagement.  Operational planning conferences towards the smooth conduct of the sea phase shall also be held during this period.  The sea phase from 07 to 11 April shall be held in the Bay of Bengal.  This shall be followed by a second harbour phase from 12 to 14 April during which debrief and setting up of goals for the next edition of AUSINDEX, which is likely to be hosted by Australia in 2021 – would be discussed.

            During AUSINDEX-19,  RAN would be represented by HMAS Canberra, an Amphibious Assault Ship; HMAS New Castle and HMAS Paramatta, both frigates; HMAS Collins, a conventional submarine and HMAS Success, a replenishment tanker. While the ships are embarked with MRH-90 and MH-60R helicopters, this year, the Australian version of P8A and ASW helicopter would also be participating.  The IN would be represented by INS Ranvijay, a multi-role destroyer, INS Sahyadri, a multi-role stealth frigate, INS Kora, a missile corvette, INS Kiltan, an ASW corvette and INS Sindhukirti, a conventional submarine.  In addition to embarked helicopters such as Seaking Mk 42B and Chetak, the aviation component of the IN shall include Dornier maritime patrol aircraft, Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers and P8I ASW aircraft.  The sea phase of this year’s edition is being conducted under the command of Rear Admiral Suraj Berry NM, VSM, Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet.  The RAN maritime assets would be headed by Rear Admiral Jonathan Mead, the Commander of the Australian Fleet.

            The number and variety of units participating in the bilateral exercise is the highest till date from both navies and signifies the importance attached to the exercise by both countries while the enhanced complexity is indicative of the interoperability between the two navies.  The current exercise will contribute towards consolidating bonds of friendship across the seas.

                The third edition of AUSINDEX, an acronym for Australia India Exercise is scheduled to commence with the arrival of HMAS Canberra (L02), a Landing Helicopter Dock, HMAS New Castle(06)  and HMAS Paramatta(154), both frigates; HMAS Collins, a conventional submarine and HMAS Success(OR 304), a Durance-class multi-product replenishment oiler at Visakhapatnam on 02 April 19. The aim of the exercise is, “To strengthen and enhance mutual cooperation and interoperability between the IN and RAN, providing opportunities for interaction and exchange of professional views between the personnel of the two navies”.  

 A sign of strengthening of bilateral and defence cooperation between the two countries as envisaged in the Framework for Security Cooperation (FSC) announced by the Australian and Indian Prime Ministers in 2014. The maiden edition of the exercise was held in September 2015 at Visakhapatnam. Australia hosted the second edition of the exercise off Freemantle in June 2017, wherein ships of the Eastern Fleet of the Indian Navy (IN) exercised with Royal Australian Navy (RAN) ships and submarines.

Building on a long history of cooperation – including the shared experiences in the trenches of World War I in Gallipoli and along the Western Front – Australia and India have a positive defence relationship, underpinned by the 2006 Memorandum of Defence Cooperation and 2009 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation.  However, post the 2014 bilateral FSC the cooperation on defence and security matters between the two countries has gained significant momentum thus, witnessing conscious and focussed enhancements. 

The complexity of the biennial maritime exercise over the past four years has steadily increased.  The third edition would involve exercises in all three dimensions with focus on ASW. The number of units being fielded by both navies in the bilateral exercise is the highest till date.  The increased scale of participation signifies the importance attached to the exercise by both countries while the enhanced complexity is indicative of the interoperability between the two navies.  Overall, the exercise underscores India’s vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and shared objectives of the two countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and solidarity with friendly and harmonious countries.

An opinion piece titled “The truth about Swachh Bharat” was published yesterday in The Telegraph. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation would like to place on record its response to the claims made in the piece about the progress made under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) and the veracity of the findings of the National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey 2018-19.

The piece compares the nationwide 90240 household survey, NARSS, conducted in over 6000 villages, with a study of four states conducted by r.i.c.e. that surveyed merely 1558 households in 157 villages in the four States. Surprisingly, the piece seems to attach greater credibility to this statistically insignificant and non-representative sample survey than the large-scale NARSS survey. It is relevant to mention here that the methodology and processes of NARSS have been developed and approved by an empowered and independent Expert Working Group (EWG) comprising leading experts on statistics and sanitation which include Prof. Amitabh Kundu, Dr N. C Saxena, World Bank, UNICEF, BMGF, Water Aid India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), among others. The EWG oversaw the entire survey process and some of the members also conducted field visits to validate the data collection process and do a thorough quality check on the results.

 

The piece calls the nationally representative and expert validated NARSS survey “statistical jugglery” while believing the statistics of the  r.i.c.e. survey,  which was found to be rife with gaps in methodology and  bias of the surveyors which was evident in the questionnaire design itself. These gaps have been highlighted by this Ministry in detail through a media statement published on the PIB website, dated January 9, 2019.

 

The NARSS 2018-19 is the largest independent sanitation survey in the country to date, making it the most representative sanitation survey in the country. The survey has found toilet usage in rural India to be 96.5%. Two more independent surveys conducted in the past by the Quality Council of India in 2017, and National Sample Survey Organization in 2016, also found the usage of these toilets to be 91% and 95% respectively.

 

These results speak for themselves and cannot conceivably be achieved without true behavior change happening at the grassroots. The claims made in this opinion piece about the programme being focused on toilet construction rather than behavior change, therefore, seem to be either ignorant or biased. The piece goes as far as to quote a 2008 study with the aim to debunk a programme that was launched only in 2014. Glaring inconsistencies like this, aside from quoting anecdotal incidents in an attempt to debunk statistically proven results points further to the obvious bias of the authors.

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) is a people-led sanitation movement in rural India and is on track to achieve an ODF India by October 2019.

                Yesterday’s cyclonic storm ‘FANI’ (pronounced as ‘FONI’) over southeast Bay of Bengal (BoB) & neighbourhood moved nearly northwards and intensified into severe cyclonic storm in the same evening (1730 hrs IST). Continuing to move nearly northwards, it intensified further into very severe cyclonic storm over southeast and adjoining southwest BoB in the early morning (0530 hrs IST) of today, the 30th April 2019.  At 1130 hrs IST of today it lay  centred over southwest & adjoining southeast of BoB near latitude 12.6°N and longitude 85.7°E, about 800 km south of Puri (Odisha), 620 km south-southeast of Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and about 660 km north-northeast of Trincomalee (Sri Lanka). 

It is very likely to intensify further into an extremely severe cyclonic storm during next 12 hours. It is very likely to move northwestwards till 01st May evening and thereafter recurve north-northeastwards and cross Odisha Coast between Gopalpur and Chandbali, to the south of Puri around 3rd May afternoon with maximum sustained wind of speed 175-185 kmph gusting to 205 kmph.

Summary of the Forecast Assessment


	Southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September) rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be near normal.
	Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal (June to September) rainfall is likely to be 96% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5%. The LPA of the season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89 cm.
	Weak El Niño conditions are likely to prevail during the monsoon season with reduced intensity in the later part of the season.


The sea surface temperature (SST) conditions over the Pacific (El Niño/La Niña) and Indian Oceans (Indian Ocean Dipole-IOD) which are known to have strong influence on Indian monsoon are being continuously monitored. Overall, the country is expected to have well distributed rainfall scenario during the 2019 monsoon season, which will be beneficial to farmers in the country during the ensuing kharif season.

IMD will issue the second stage Monsoon-2019 Forecast during the first week of June, 2019.

1. Background

India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues operational forecast for the southwest monsoon season (June to September) rainfall for the country as a whole in two stages. The first stage forecast is issued in April and the second stage forecast is issued in June. These forecasts are prepared using state-of-the-art Statistical Ensemble Forecasting system (SEFS) and using the dynamical coupled Ocean-Atmosphere global


Climate Forecasting System (CFS) model developed under Monsoon Mission of the Ministry of Earth Sciences.

IMD’s SEFS model for the April forecast uses the following 5 predictors that require data upto March.

2. Forecast for the 2019 Southwest monsoon Season (June – September) rainfall over the country as a whole

2a. Forecast based on the Monsoon Mission CFS Model

For generating the forecast for the 2019 southwest Monsoon season rainfall, global atmospheric and oceanic initial conditions up to March 2019 were used involving 47 ensemble members.

The forecast based on the CFS model suggests that the monsoon rainfall during the 2019 monsoon season (June to September) averaged over the country as a whole is likely to be 94% ± 5% of the Long Period Average (LPA).

2b. Forecast based on the Operational SEFS


	Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall is likely to be 96% of the Long  Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5%.
	The 5 category probability forecasts for the Seasonal (June to September) rainfall over the country as a whole is given below:

Forecast suggests that the 2019 Southwest monsoon rainfall is likely to be near normal. However, there is very less chance for the monsoon rainfall to be above normal or excess.

Overall, the country is expected to have well distributed rainfall scenario during the 2019 monsoon season, which will be beneficial to farmers in the country during the ensuing Kharif season.

3. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Conditions in the equatorial Pacific & Indian Oceans

At present, weak El Niño conditions (SST anomalies between 0.50 C & 1.00 C) are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The latest forecasts from the Monsoon Mission CFS & other global climate models indicate such conditions are likely to persist during the monsoon season but with reduced intensity in the later part of the monsoon season. It is noted that El Niño predictions made in February/March generally have more uncertainties compared to the El Niño predictions made in June.

At present, neutral IOD conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean. The latest forecasts from the models indicate positive IOD conditions development likely during the monsoon season. Positive IOD conditions tend to associate with the normal monsoon over India.

                Analysis of Weather Conditions

Numerical model products, satellite information, and analysis of weather observations are indicating that a strong western disturbance is approaching and would adversely affect weather over Northwest India including Delhi-NCR during 15-17 April with peak activity on 16 April. The western disturbance on approaching Northwest India will draw fresh moisture from Arabian Sea as well as from Bay of Bengal, with both the streams confluence over central India and neighbourhood. The thermodynamic atmospheric conditions would become favorable for development of instability in the atmosphere and occurrence of widespread Thunderstorm activity over the region.

 

Weather Forecast for 15-17 April


	Rainfall activity would occur at most places over Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand mainly on 16-17 April.
	Light to moderate rainfall/thundershowers would occur at many places over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, and West Uttar Pradesh and at a few places over Rajasthan and East Uttar Pradesh.


 

Weather Warnings for 16-17 April


	Heavy rainfall very likely to occur at isolated places over Western Himalayan region.
	Intense Rainfall spells also likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi.
	Thunderstorm accompanied with lightening, Hailstorm and squall with wind speed of 60-70 KMPH gusting to 80 KMPH very likely over Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & West Uttar Pradesh and with wind speed of 40-50 KMPH gusting to 60 KMPH over Rajasthan and East Uttar Pradesh.


 

Forecast for Delhi/NCR

Partly Cloudy Sky with possibility of Thundery development and gusty winds likely on 15 April. However, weather is likely to be intense on 16-17 April with generally cloudy conditions and Thunderstorms accompanied with lightening, Hailstorm and squall with wind speed of 60-70 KMPH gusting to 80 KMPH.

                A one-day National Consultation on Loss and Damage, to deliberate and brainstorm on emerging perspectives on approaches to assess, minimise and address climate-related loss and damage, was hosted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in New Delhi today.

The workshop was inaugurated by Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Dr. P. K. Mishra, who mentioned that India has been experiencing weather and climate related loss and damage, the Kerala floods and Ockhi being the rarest of the rare events. Given the evolving scenario, he suggested that the past is no longer a good guide for the future, and therefore such workshops are important. He identified five principal challenges that need to be addressed, including the need to understand not only the total quantum of loss but also its location, as well as impact on gender and social groups, the need to go beyond what is easier to measure, such as biodiversity loss, ecosystem services etc., address the attribution of the loss and damage, generate scenarios for future situations and invest in adaptive capacities, and the need to bring out clearly that loss and damage is not only an issue for small island developing countries, but also a critical issue in large countries like India which has a long coastline with numerous islands and coastal cities and Himalayan states at the risk of glacier outbreaks. He further underlined that India has committed to ensuring climate justice and mentioned the need for the developed countries to show greater commitment to support the most vulnerable and developing countries, including financial and capacity building support.

CEO, NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant, complimented the Ministry for the unique initiative of organizing the workshop and mentioned that the topic of loss and damage has become a major pillar of international negotiations under UNFCCC and has gained importance since COP 19 held in Warsaw. He highlighted that India, being bigger than 23 European countries and having a higher rate of growth and population, is facing greater challenges as compared to developed countries. The need to follow low carbon sustainable pathway, poverty alleviation and addressing climate change impacts are to be prioritized, said Shri Kant

Secretary, Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri C. K. Mishra highlighted that GHG emissions have been talked many times, but the discourse needs to move to critical elements and systematic planning. He urged the global community to come up with a global plan to address the issue loss and damage. He mentioned the Fiji Clearing House on Risk Transfer introduced at UNFCCC COP23, which was the first time when risk transfer and mitigation was discussed internationally. It was brought out that it is not only a Small Island States issue, but also for countries like India which who are at the risk of facing climate induced loss and damage. He added that global experience is good for knowledge and learning, but the country needs to bring in its own policies and recommendations as it has a diverse geography. He also underlined the three critical elements for addressing the issue of loss and damage, including risk reduction through more plantation, risk retention and risk transfer through insurance and funding mechanism.

Mr. Chad Tudenggongbu, representative from UNFCCC, talked about the global context of the issue of loss and damage, including heat waves, tropical cyclones, salinization, glacial retreat and desertification. He highlighted that the response action for loss and damage often requires multinational arrangements, with enhanced action and support.

The workshop had two technical sessions on specific topics including ‘Strengthening response to address loss and damage’ and ‘Approaches to assess, manage and address climate risks and loss and damage’ with eminent speakers from various State Governments, organisations and institutions including International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, IIT Delhi, Madras School of Economics, National Institute of Disaster Management, ActionAid International, Government of Tamil Nadu, Government of Uttarakhand, Government of Kerala, GIZ, and Indian Institute of Public Administration.

                Income Tax Department conducted search and seizure operations at 5 locations in the Kashmir Valley today. The searches were carried-out against a Group which is a monopolistic wholesale distributer of pharmaceuticals in the Kashmir Valley. It was gathered that the Group charged huge premium on life saving drugs which were exclusively sourced through it in the Valley and the extra normal profits earned by this modus operandi were used for investment in real estate in Srinagar, as well as for unaccounted expenditure by the promoter’s family not disclosed in their income tax returns.

The search action has yielded incriminating documents and digital evidence that suggest huge concealment of income by the promoter and his family members. Apparently, Rs. 3.08 crore of on-money in transactions of 2 pieces of land in Srinagar has been earned by the Group, which has not been disclosed in the returns of income. The digital evidence in the form of hard disc that has been seized, indicates that a part of the sales proceeds, approximating nearly 10% of the turnover are kept outside the books of accounts to suppress profits.

The search action has also led to unearthing of an undisclosed bank account in the name of a family member of the promoter of the Group in the J& K Bank at the Allamgiri Branch in Srinagar. The proceeds in this bank account are apparently used to channel unaccounted income earned in the pharmaceutical business. Three bank lockers of the Group have also been found in the search and their operation is likely to yield more incriminating evidence against the Group. The Group has been allowed restructuring of its debt owed to J&K Bank, whereby 50 percent of its monthly interest repayment is waived. Prima facie, the debt has been restructured in a manner that defies normal commercial transaction norms.

The searched Group had deposited cash of Rs. 47.20 lakh in the old demonetised currency during the demonetisation period. The source of this cash remains unexplained.

	     Accommodation entries of Rs 370 crore: During the search, a maze of shell companies used as mere conduits for providing entries to the group have been detected. Accommodation entries in the garb of bogus unsecured loans/share application money to the tune of Rs. 370 crore have been found.


 


	   Bogus billing of Rs. 330 crore: Evidence of inflation of expenses through bogus billing to the tune of around Rs. 330 crore has been detected in the case of a power plant of the said group. The money so siphoned off was collected in USD through hawala operators.


 


	   Unaccounted diary transactions of Rs. 240 crore:  A handwritten diary containing records of out of books cash receipts to the tune of around Rs.240 crore was seized from the office of the group. The entries therein have been admitted by the persons concerned.


 


	   Bogus loans of Rs. 30 crore in a group company: Investigations reveal that a loan entry of Rs. 30 crore in one of the group companies was an accommodation entry arranged by an entry operator against equivalent cash.


 


	   Over-invoicing of imports and round tripping of Rs. 252 crore: During the search, evidence was found indicating that the group grossly over-invoiced its imports from original manufacturers by re-invoicing it through a shell company of a person who is an accused in a major defence scam. The surplus so created was ploughed back in the books as FDI through another shell company of the same person.


 


	  Unaccounted foreign investments/expenses: Enquiries reveal that the Group used the services of a Dubai based operator to park unaccounted foreign remittances in overseas jurisdictions. Out of such remittances, approximately Rs. 27 crore was paid towards credit card expenses and Rs. 72 crore for purchase of a property abroad.


 


	    Apart from the above, unaccounted payment of Rs. 9 crore towards purchase of a property has also been detected.


 


	   Seizure of unaccounted assets of Rs. 3 crore has been made during the search.


 

The search action was undertaken on the basis of credible information and has led to detection of large scale tax evasion of more than Rs. 1350 crore.

                Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) places the report of the Committee on Profit Attribution on online public domain and invites suggestions/comments to be furnished electronically within 30 days from the date of publication of the aforementioned document on the website of the Department. The document can be accessed at www.incometaxindia.gov.in and comments can be sent to email address: usfttr-1[at]gov[dot]in. 

 

Background:

Taxation of non-residents in India is governed by the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“the Act”) and the provisions of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement(s) [DTAA(s)] concluded or adopted by the Central Government under the powers conferred under Section 90 or 90A of the Act, respectively. The business income of a non-resident can be taxed in India if it satisfies the requisite thresholds provided under the Act as well as the threshold provided in the applicable tax treaty, by a concept of Permanent Establishment (PE), which is defined in Article 5 of Model Tax Conventions and tax treaties. Under Article 7 in the Indian treaties, profits are to be attributed to the PE as if it were a distinct and separate entity on the basis of the accounts of the PE and where such accounts are not available to enable determination of profits attributable to the PE, the profits attributable to the PE can be determined under the domestic laws. For the application of this method, the Assessing Officer in India can resort to Rule 10 of Income-tax Rules, 1962. 

Recognizing the significance of issues relating to attribution of profits to a permanent establishment as well as the need to bring greater clarity and predictability in the applicable tax regime, a Committee was formed to examine the existing scheme of profit attribution to PE under Article 7 of DTAAs and recommend changes in Rule 10 of the Income-tax Rules, 1962. The Committee has submitted its report and it has been decided to seek suggestions/comments of the stakeholders and the general public.

                Ministry of Health and Family Welfare along with World Health Organization (WHO) today formed a Solidarity Human Chain as part of the World Health Day celebrations to reaffirm their commitment to bridging gaps and working collaboratively towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The theme of World Health Day 2019 is Universal Health Coverage: Everyone, Everywhere. Speaking at the function, Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health) stated that this event emphasizes our commitment to ensure all people and communities have access to quality healthcare services, where and when they are required, without suffering financial hardship. At the event, Ms. Preeti Sudan also administered the solidarity pledge to work towards making universal health care available to everyone, everywhere.  

Shri Manoj Jhalani (AS&MD), Dr S. Venkatesh, DGHS, Dr. Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative India along with other senior officers of the Ministry and representatives from WHO were also present at the function.

Secretary (Health) further stated that Ayushman Bharat has two components - Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) for Primary Health Care and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) for secondary and tertiary care. These components are linked to address the major challenges of ensuring continuum of care, two-way referral system and gatekeeping. 

Ms. Preeti Sudan said that the government is committed to strengthening 1,50,000 health facilities as Health and Wellness Centres which will deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care closer to where people live in the rural and urban areas. “As of today, more than 17,000 HWCs are operational across the country and are providing services for non-communicable diseases in addition to existing services for reproductive and child health, communicable diseases etc,” Ms. Preeti Sudan elaborated.

Speaking at the event, World Health Organization Representative to India Dr. Henk Bekedam said, “A well-equipped primary health care delivery system is the key to achieving universal health coverage. This will require bringing quality care closer to people; strengthening peripheral health centres with linkages to secondary and tertiary care; and equipping primary health care providers to effectively deliver a package of preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative services. Let’s join hands to work on this.”

April 7 of each year marks the celebration of World Health Day. This year’s World Health Day will focus on equity and solidarity. From its inception at the First Health Assembly in 1948 and since taking effect in 1950, the celebration has aimed to create awareness of a specific health theme to highlight a priority area of concern for the World Health Organization. Over the past 50 years this has brought to light important health issues such as mental health, maternal and child care, and climate change. The celebration is marked by activities which extend beyond the day itself and serves as an opportunity to focus worldwide attention on these important aspects of global health.

                The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) met here today under the chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary and took stock of the situation arising out of the Cyclonic Storm ‘Fani’. Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal attended through Video Conference. Senior Officers from the Central Ministries/Agencies concerned also attended the meeting.

During the meeting, officers of all the concerned State Governments confirmed their full preparedness to deal with any emerging situation arising out of the cyclonic storm. Further, the State Governments have adequately warned fishermen not to venture into the sea and highlighted that there is a seasonal ban on fishing in sea upto 14th June due to breeding season. State Governments were advised to effectively enforce this ban.

Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) assured the State Governments to release in advance the first Instalment of SDRF, as per their request. 

According to India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s forecast, the Cyclonic Storm ‘Fani’ is at present located at 880 Kms. South East of Chennai.  It is expected to intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm by 30th April 2019. The storm will continue to move northwest till 01st May 2019 and thereafter recurve northeastwards gradually. The Government is keeping a close watch on the impact on States on the Eastern Coast.

NDRF and Indian Coast Guard have been put on high alert and are coordinating with State Government Authorities. They have prepositioned themselves adequately. Regular warnings have been issued since 25th April 2019 to fishermen not to venture into the sea and asking those at sea to return to coast.  IMD has been issuing three hourly bulletins with latest forecast to all the concerned States. MHA is also in continuous touch with the State Governments and the Central Agencies concerned. 

The NCMC Meeting followed directions from the Prime Minister who is closely monitoring the situation. NCMC will meet again tomorrow to take stock of the situation.

                MHA has issued orders to suspend the LoC trade in Jammu & Kashmir w.e.f 19-04-2019. This action has been taken as the Government of India has been receiving reports that the Cross LoC trade routes are being misused by the Pakistan based elements for funnelling illegal weapons, narcotics and fake currency etc.

It may be recalled that the LoC trade is meant to facilitate exchange of goods of common use between local populations across the LoC in Jammu & Kashmir. The trade is allowed through two Trade Facilitation Centres located at Salamabad, Uri, District Baramulla and Chakkan-da-Bagh, District Poonch. The trade takes place four days a week. The Trade is based on Barter system and zero duty basis.

However, reports have been received that the LoC trade is being misused on very large scale. It has been revealed that the trade has changed its character to mostly third party trade and products from other regions, including foreign countries, are finding their way through this route. Unscrupulous and anti national elements are using the route as a conduit for Hawala money, drugs and weapons, under the garb of this trade.

During the ongoing investigations of certain cases by NIA, it has been brought out that a significant number of trading concerns engaged in LoC trade are being operated by persons closely associated with banned terrorist organizations involved in fuelling terrorism/separatism. Investigations have further revealed that some individuals, who have crossed over to Pakistan, and joined militant organizations have opened trading firms in Pakistan. These trading firms are under the control of militant organizations and are engaged in LoC trade.

After the Pulwama incident, Government of India has withdrawn the MFN status to Pakistan. Inputs have also been received that in order to evade the consequent higher duty, LoC trade is likely to be misused to a much larger extent.

It has, therefore, been decided by the Government of India to suspend the LoC trade at Salamabad and Chakkan-da-Bagh in Jammu and Kashmir with immediate effect. Meanwhile, a stricter regulatory & enforcement mechanism is being worked out and will be put in place in consultation with various agencies. The issue of reopening of LoC trade will be revisited thereafter.

                For the first time in the 140 year long Census exercise in India, data is proposed to be collected through a mobile app, officials of  Registrar General of India said at the conference of data users here today to finalize the strategy and questionnaire for the Census 2021. They said enumerators would be encouraged to use their own mobile phone for which they would be paid appropriate remuneration or else there is also option to collect and record the data through paper schedules which will eventually be submitted electronically by them. 

Describing the Census 2021 as the world’s largest such exercise, Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba informed the conference that 33 lakh enumerators would be mobilized for data collection for which notification has already been issued. The reference date is 1st October 2020 for Jammu & Kashmir and snow bound areas of Himachal Pradesh & Uttarakhand  while for the rest of country the reference date is 1st March 2021.  Shri  Gauba  said Census is not just an exercise of head count but also provides invaluable socio-economic data which forms credible basis for informed policy formulation and allocation of resources. The changing demographics and socio economic parameters reflected by the census helps in reformulation of country’s plans for the economic development and welfare schemes for its people, he added. 

Besides, census data caters to the Constitutional requirement of delimitation of constituencies and reservation of seats for SCs & STs, Shri Gauba said. 

He urged caution while using technology for data collection in Census 2021 and stressed that data confidentiality should be maintained. He asked the participants – representatives from Ministries of Central and State governments, academic institutions and international organizations--  to deliberate on the strategy and questionnaire for the census to maximize the benefits from this exercise. 

Registrar General of India and Census Commissioner Shri Vivek Joshi in his welcome address  said that Census 2021 will be conducted in two phases. In the first phase House Listing Operations would be conducted in any two months chosen by the States between April-September 2020. In the second phase, actual population enumeration would be done during 9th – 28th February 2021, followed by the Revision round from 1st – 5th  March 2021.  Shri Joshi said in Jammu and Kashmir and snow bound areas of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, population enumeration would be conducted during 11th- 30th September 2020, followed by the Revision round from 1st – 5th October 2020. 

The data users conference is the first formal interaction of the census organization with various stakeholders. The two day conference is expected to have intensive deliberations on the proposed Strategy and the draft Questionnaire for the 2021 Census. The results of deliberations will form the basis for finalizing the questions and the methodology for the census. 

The Secretary DoPT, Dr. C. Chandramouli and the Secretary, Ministry of Minority Affairs, Shri Sailesh, both former RGIs, also addressed the Conference and gave their valuable suggestions and inputs to enhance the validation and quality of the data of Census 2021.

The conference is being  attended by Academics, representatives from different Ministries, States/UTs and Directorates of Census Operations.

• In order to maintain sustainable environment, pollution free clean air, it is essential to take up the plantation work.

• Cost of land has increased manifold and high rise buildings are coming up, people are getting hardly any area for the greenery. Keeping in view the same, plantation, greenery and other environment friendly applications should be planned around the building by way of dwarf trees, small shrubs, ground covers, hanging baskets, creepers, etc.

• There is need to adopt wood alternative in building construction. Use of alternate materials like Bamboo needs to be encouraged.

• Orientation and proper training should be imparted to the persons engaged in landscaping and Horticulture, for implementation of the new technologies in this field to save the labour and cost of the project in long run.

• Emphasis should be given for conserving and transplanting indigenous and grown up trees.

• Herbal and medicinal plants need to be encourage. Herbal plants are useful for keeping the life healthy.

• Application of Organic Manure needs to be adopted for healthy and nutritious food.

• Water conserving irrigation method like drip irrigation, Sprinkler irrigation and pop up system needs to be adopted.

• Plants and greenery help in reducing adverse effects of climate change. Therefore every individual should adopt minimum one tree.

                The selections for National Film Awards are made by an independent and impartial jury consisting of eminent film makers and film personalities and declared in the month of April every year.

However, this year elections to the 17th Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies of four states are underway and the Awards also include one for the most film friendly state. Since the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is in force, which facilitates level playing field to all political parties and the candidates and inter alia seeks to ensure that the power of media is not used in such a manner which affects the general conduct and level playing field during the election process, it has been decided to declare the awards after the election process is over and the MCC concludes.

Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø  Sohagpur West CBM Block:  Increase in number of wells requiring workover due to sanding, scaling and resultant pump replacement requirement etc. 36 development wells which are still under dewatering phase and gas breakout is yet to be seen. (RIL)

Ø  Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field.

Ø  Loss from Mangala due to delay in upgrade of Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) and delay in drilling, completion and hooking up online 45 infill wells and lower inputs from NE development drilling campaign (CEIL).

Total production crossed 13 lakh MT in FY’19 (up by 9% y-o-y), which is the highest achievement in last ten years. The company has also achieved highest-ever production of non-fines manganese ore. Non-fines sales are also at a record-high of11 lakh MT (up by 13% y-o-y). The total production growth in last three years is around 30%. Currently, MOIL holds 34% of manganese ore reserves of the country and is contributing 50% of the domestic production.

MOIL is also giving special focus thrust on expansion and modernization of its mines to sustain production levels and attain capacity enhancement. Projects of sinking of second vertical shaft at Chikla mine and shaft deepening at Kandri and Balaghat mines have been completed during the year. These will enable the Company sustain enhanced level of production from these mines. Its projects of shaft sinking at Ukwa and Munsar mines and high speed shafts at Balaghat and Gumgaon mines are progressing as per schedule.

In addition to the above, development and production activities have been started during the year at Parsoda (in Nagpur district) – 11th mine of MOIL. Annual production at this mine will gradually increase to 40,000 MT. The Company is also actively pursuing cases of prospecting and mining leases in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, mostly in areas adjacent to its existing mines.

The above projects/new leases will enable MOIL to move towards its vision of doubling production to 25 lakh MT by FY 2024-25.

                One day Technical Seminar was organized by Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation on “Use of Technical Textiles in Water Resources Works” in New Delhi today. 

 

 

 

Technical Textiles are being used globally for last several decades. These materials have provided innovative engineering solutions for several applications in civil and geotechnical engineering, for infrastructure water resources projects. Even while Technical Textiles have been extensively used in developed as well as many developing countries, India has yet to capitalise the technical, economical and environmental benefits on large scale. Various parts of India are subjected to floods and environmental degradation. In some of the terrains, the flood management and control can rely on Technical Textiles tubes, containers and bags. Technical Textiles have been found to perform better than concrete as water protection component because of permeability, flexibility and ease of underwater placement. The Seminar highlighted various application areas, best practices and mechanisms for encouraging larger usage of Technical Textile in Water Resources Sector and created a platform for all the concerned stakeholders for brain-storming and creating a roadmap to take the Technical Textiles uses to the next level.

The speakers from various fields discussed issues of Standards, Benchmarking & Testing, Technical-textiles for Water Resources Conservation, Advanced methods in use of Technical Textiles, Contractual Matters related to Technical Textiles etc. in detail.

 

The event was organized by Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation with participation from high level Officials from Central Departments, State Governments, Engineering Departments of States working in Water Resources, Institutions, Colleges, Universities, Manufacturers, Associations, Trade Associations, Consultants and Contractors.

 

The seminar was chaired by Shri Masood Hussain, Chairman, CWC. Smt. T. Rajeshwari, Addl. Secretary, MoWR, RD and GR, Shri N.K. Mathur, Member D&R, CWC, Shri S.L. Gupta, Director CSMRS and Shri Anuj Kanwal, Director, R&D Division, MoWR, RD and GR also attended the seminar. Chairman CWC released the “Practice Manual on use of Technical Textile in Water Resources Works”.

                The NITI Aayog and the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) released a report on opportunities for the automobile sector and government under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles II (FAME II) scheme. 

The technical report titled ‘India’s Electric Mobility Transformation: Progress to Date and Future Opportunities’,quantifies the direct oil and carbon savings that the vehicles incentivized under FAME II will deliver. RMI is an Indian and global nonprofit organisation focused on driving the efficient and restorative use of resources.

The report also quantifies the catalytic effect that FAME II and other measures could have on the overall Electric Vehicle(EV) market. According to the analysis, if FAME II and other measures – in public and private space - are successful, India could realize EV sales penetration of 30% of private cars, 70% of commercial cars, 40% of buses and 80% of two and three-wheelers by 2030. 

Extrapolating from the same, the lifetime cumulative oil and carbon savings of all electric vehicles deployed through 2030 could be many-fold larger than the direct savings from FAME II.For example,achieving these levels of market share by 2030 could generate cumulative savings of 846million tonnes of CO2 over the total deployedvehicles’ lifetime.

The FAME II scheme, which was notified by the Union Cabinet in February 2019, aims to further accelerate the government of India’scommitment to a clean mobility future, sees the electrification of transportation as a primary focus area. FAME IIintends to catalyze the market for faster adoption of EVs to ensure durable economic growth and global competitiveness for India’s automotive industry.

Key highlights from the report:


	Effects of FAME II will go beyond the vehicles that are eligible under the FAME II
	There is considerable energy and CO2 savings associated with the two, three, and four-wheeled vehicles and buses covered by FAME II over their lifetime, as well as the potential savings associated with greater adoption levels by 2030
	The electric buses covered under FAME II will account for 3.8 billion vehicle kilometers travelled (e-vkt) over their lifetime
	In order to capture the potential opportunity in 2030, batteries must remain a key focal point as they will continue to be the key cost driver of EVs.
	Vehicles eligible under FAME II scheme can cumulatively save 5.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent over their lifetime worth Rs 17.2 thousand crores.
	EVs sold through 2030 could cumulatively save 474 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) worth INR 15 lakh crore and generate net CO2 savings of 846 million tonnes over their operational lifetime.
	India needs auto industry's active participation to ease electric mobility transition. The auto and battery industries could collaborate to enhance customer awareness, promote domestic manufacturing, promote new business models, conduct R&D for EVs and components, consider new business models to promote EVs
	Government should focus on a phased manufacturing plan to promote EVs, provide fiscal and non-fiscal incentives for phased manufacturing of EVs and batteries. Different government departments can consider a bouquet of potential policies, such as congestion pricing, ZEV credits, low emission/exclusion zones, parking policies, etc. to drive adoption of EVs.


India’s electric vehicle market is poised for growth with a blend of policies, such as FAME II, and the automotive industry’s willingness to provide new mobility solutions to the citizens of the country. Such a transformation will create enormous economic, social and environmental benefits for the citizens of India.
