The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 33rd convocation of Ranchi University in Ranchi, Jharkhand today (September 30, 2019). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Jharkhand is home to 40 per cent of the country’s mineral reserves. Many big public and private sector industries are established in the state. There are many tourists’ attractions in Jharkhand. The state has also many good educational institutions. On the strength of many such characteristics of Jharkhand and the talent of youth, it has potential to become a developed state. 

The President noted that Ranchi University has established Department of Ethnic and Regional Languages in 1980 to preserve and promote languages and culture of Jharkhand. At present five tribal languages - Kudukh, Mundari, Santhali, Ho and Kharia - are taught in the University. He said that the knowledge of tribal languages and cultures should be used to connect with the community and for development. We should learn from the tribal communities to meet our needs in harmony with nature. He said that the Ranchi University could make multi-dimensional contribution by encouraging research on tribal culture and civilization.

The President said that universities should contribute towards Universities' Social Responsibility (USR). At least five students from each university should go to nearby villages at an interval of about two months, and if possible, stay there at night and interact with the villagers. They should communicate with the villagers about welfare and development schemes of the central and state government. He urged Ranchi University to pay special attention to USR.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced the Foundation Day Celebrations of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) in New Delhi today (September 26, 2019).  

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the true test of scientific research lies in its ability to help our society accelerate socio-economic development in various areas of human life such as health and hygiene, sanitation, education and agriculture. In the long run, this ability depends on the extent to which the culture of scientific research and innovation permeates our society, institutions and enterprises. 

The President said that science and technology is one of the key levers to achieve our national goals and to address the larger concerns confronting humanity today. We have set ourselves a goal of becoming a 5-trillion dollar economy by 2025. We are committed to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. We also wish to play our role in addressing global concerns such as climate change. To a great extent, our success in meeting these challenges would depend on our ability to find creative solutions based in scientific research. 

The President said that through innovation our entrepreneurs can become solution providers to many of our challenges. Their success will determine our economic future and our growth trajectory. Our academic and scientific institutions, industry and entrepreneurs must collaborate to ensure that scientific research can move from labs to our industry, agricultural fields, incubation centres and start-ups. 

The President said that the scientific community, academic institutions and industry are aware of the uncertainty and risks which are inherent to scientific research, innovation and entrepreneurship. He urged them to embrace that uncertainty and take that calculated risk. He said that there lies the possibility of developing truly transformative technologies and innovations that can help fulfil our goals as a nation, as humanity and as a planet.

	I am happy to be amongst you all on the occasion of the 78th Foundation Day of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. I fondly recollect attending CSIR’s platinum jubilee celebrations two years ago. With each passing year this apex science and technology institution seems to be getting stronger and contributing more and more to our nation’s development. I congratulate the entire CSIR fraternity as well as all the scientists who are being awarded today.


 


	CSIR is known for its cutting edge R&D in diverse areas. Its work covers a wide spectrum of science and technology. More importantly, CSIR has helped improve quality of life of our fellow citizens and aided business and industry with specific science and technology applications. Across different areas such as food and agriculture, generic drugs, leather, chemicals, several technologies developed by you have been embraced by the market. CSIR occupies a key place in India’s scientific space. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	The true test of scientific research lies in its ability to help our society accelerate socio-economic development in various areas of human life such as health and hygiene, sanitation, education and agriculture. In the long run, this ability depends on the extent to which the culture of scientific research and innovation permeates our society, institutions and enterprises.


 


	Science and technology is one of the key levers to achieve our national goals and to address the larger concerns confronting humanity today. We have set ourselves a goal of becoming a 5-trillion dollar economy by 2025. We are committed to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. We also wish to play our role in addressing global concerns such as climate change. To a great extent, our success in meeting these challenges would depend on our ability to find creative solutions based in scientific research. In this regard, your work has benefited society in ways that are not always known to many. For instance, I am told that through its interventions, CSIR contributed its bit in saving precious lives during cyclone Fani that hit Odisha earlier this year.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen, 


	India is blessed with a youthful population that should be motivated to learn, imbibe and adopt science and innovation. I am happy to learn that CSIR provides a large number of doctoral and post-doctoral research fellowships. The “Jigyasa” program of CSIR is connecting students to scientists and igniting the scientific spirit in school students all across the country. I am told that in the past year alone thousands of school students have visited CSIR’s R&D labs spread across the country.


 


	Initiatives such as Skill India, Start Up India and Stand Up India are aimed at releasing and realising the entrepreneurial power of India. Through innovation our entrepreneurs can become solution providers to many of our challenges. Their success will determine our economic future and our growth trajectory. Our academic and scientific institutions, industry and entrepreneurs must collaborate to ensure that scientific research can move from labs to our industry, agricultural fields, incubation centres and start-ups. 


 


	Today, Dr Harsh Vardhan presented to me the Fuel Cell Prototype that has been developed by CSIR labs in collaboration with Industry. I understand that this is the first indigenous prototype and the fuel cells use hydrogen to produce electricity. It has possible use for distributed power supply and e-mobility applications. This is an example of how scientific institutions can connect with industry and business for the benefit of society.


 


	The scientific community, academic institutions and industry are aware of the uncertainty and risks which are inherent to scientific research, innovation and entrepreneurship. I urge you to embrace that uncertainty and take that calculated risk. There lies the possibility of developing truly transformative technologies and innovations that can help fulfil our goals as a nation, as humanity and as a planet.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	I must point out here that none of our successes will have any meaning without equal opportunities for our girl-children. As President, I get an opportunity to attend convocations of Universities and academic institutions across the country. In most of these convocations, I find that our girl students outshine the boys, winning most of the academic awards. Recently, Project Director of Chandrayaan-2 mission, M Vanitha and its Mission Director Ritu Karidhal became household names. 


 


	Yet on a broader level, the participation of women in science in our country is far from satisfactory. We have to take the necessary steps to ensure greater participation of girl students and of women in science and technology. When this happens, our scientific achievements will become even more wholesome and more desirable. 


 


	The purpose of education, in its very essence, is to make us a well-rounded personality, a good human being and society. We must develop interest in a range of subjects beyond our own. A good scientist will become a better scientist with some knowledge of social sciences and liberal arts. Similarly, a student of humanities will gain from an appreciation of science. As academic institutions and as individual students we need to appreciate this and take measures to broad-base our education.  


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	We live in a world where technology surrounds us and dazzles us. Technological products and applications are changing our lives every moment. Space travel is no longer a distant dream, Artificial Intelligence and robotics are no longer science fiction, 3D printers have entered our homes and driverless cars are set to dominate our roads. The relationship between human and machine is evolving before our eyes. Indeed this is all exciting but let it not divert our attention from basic science research. For that remains fundamentally important.


 


	We look to CSIR to help us navigate and adapt to this new technological-world as well as to strengthen our basic scientific research. I am confident that CSIR will continue to work on new technologies as well as basic research relevant to our developmental goals.


 


	I convey my best wishes to CSIR and its community of scientists. May you continue your illustrious journey in the service of science and society. 


 

Thank You,

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated a seminar on ‘Spirituality for Human and Social Development’ today (September 26, 2019) in New Delhi. This seminar is being organised by the Ahimsa Vishwa Bharti to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Mahatma Gandhi had understood very well that emphasis on spiritual values is essential for establishment of peace and non-violence in the world. He made it clear that the uplift human society is only possible on the foundation of truth, non-violence, peace and harmony. These thoughts of Gandhiji are relevant even today, and will remain relevant in future as well. 

The President said that Gandhian values are relevant to address a range of contemporary issues our world is facing, such as terrorism, violence, corruption, immorality, discrimination based on - religion, race, language, -  and climate-change. The global community will benefit from following the path shown by Gandhiji.  

The President said that youth comprise 65 percent of our population. Connecting them to Gandhiji's ideals will help create a better society. He urged Ahimsa Vishwa Bharati to ensure maximum participation of youth in their programmes.

	I am happy to inaugurate the 6th India Water Week-2019 being attended by a large number of delegates and stakeholders from within the country and across the globe. I am sure that all of you will engage in meaningful discussion and help find effective ideas and innovative solutions to address water-related issues in India.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	I pose a question to all of you. Can we imagine life without water? We all will say ‘No’. Our Vedas have highlighted its importance. I quote a few words from Yajurveda:


 

आपो हिष्ठा मयो भुवः,

स्था न ऊर्जे दधातन......

यो वः शिवतमो रसः।

 

Broadly, it translates to:  Water is the life-giver on earth. It is a great source of energy. It is the most beneficial elixir.

 


	Over the ages, great civilizations and cities flourished alongside mighty rivers. Be it the Indus Valley, Egyptian, or Chinese Civilizations or be it Varanasi, Madurai, Paris, or Moscow, they all grew next to rivers. Where there was water, humanity thrived and survived. In the present times, we humans search for water as distant as the moon. At the same time, we have been negligent in preserving water resources on our own planet. When a child is born, the parents start planning for his or her future. We start saving for their future needs of education and so on. But do we ever think that our child would need fresh and clean water for his or her survival? We owe it to our future generations to make water conservation a priority. Many efforts for this cause are underway across the world. India Water Week too is one such notable effort. 


 


	The theme of this edition of India Water Week is ‘Water Cooperation – Coping with 21st Century Challenges’. Indeed, cooperation between different stakeholders is critical, if we are to face the challenges concerning water effectively. Water issues are too multi-faceted and complex to be solved by only the government or just one nation. All nations and their water communities have to come together to help build a water sustainable future for all. 


 


	Research suggests that about 40 per cent of the world’s population lives in water-stressed areas. Climate change and related environmental concerns have made provision of safe and clean drinking water even more challenging. Despite the challenges, I am happy to note that the Government of India has made provision of safe and clean drinking water to citizens one of its primary goals. 


 


	To ensure better water governance and improved sanitary conditions, the Government merged several departments related to water and sanitation into a new integrated Ministry of Jal Shakti. Now, this Ministry will provide a single-window system for all water-related issues, ensuring speedier and effective solutions.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	I also appreciate the Government for envisaging the Jal Jeevan Mission, which plans to supply water to every rural household by 2024. This is a bold and ambitious Mission as presently only about 18 per cent of rural households in India get piped water supply. This Mission will focus on integrated demand and supply side management of water at the local level. It will create infrastructure for rainwater harvesting, ground-water recharge and management of household waste-water. I am confident that with widespread people’s participation, the Government will be able to achieve the Mission’s goal.


 


	Water is a key resource for our farmers and for sustainable agriculture. The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana which was launched in 2015, is a major initiative for this sector. This nation-wide scheme is being implemented to increase the irrigated area in the country. Consistent with our water conservation goals, the scheme also envisages adoption of precision-irrigation and water saving technologies to ensure “More Crop-Per Drop”. We often talk of reducing our “carbon-footprint”. It is time we talk of reducing our “water-footprint” as well. Our farmers, corporate leaders and government bodies need to actively consider the “water-footprint’’ of different crops and industries. We need to encourage agricultural and industrial practices that have the least water-footprint.   


 


	Managing and mapping ground-water resources is also an important aspect of water governance. The widespread use of boring machines has led to unregulated and excessive exploitation of ground-water. We have to value our ground-water and be responsible. Moreover, we need to document our ground-water resources. I am told that under our National Aquifer Mapping Program, we have so far, mapped over a million square kilo meters, while another 1.5 million will be mapped by March 2021.


 


	We have to ensure that our precious rainwater does not get wasted. We need to store and capture our rainwater by utilizing our existing reservoirs, dams, other water bodies and by adopting water harvesting measures in our homes and neighbourhoods. Water scarcity and drought situation faced by many of our states can be greatly mitigated with effective rainwater harvesting. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	India is blessed with a number of rivers. These rivers form an integral part of our lives and culture. We worship them and we hold them in high regard. Yet, today our rivers are polluted. It is time we come together to rejuvenate them.


 


	Here, I must appreciate the Government of India for launching ‘National Mission for Clean Ganga’. This mission entails numerous projects to ensure the continuous and unpolluted flow of the Ganga. I grew up in Kanpur and have fond memories associated with river Ganga, which we regard as our mother. I am personally attached to the vision of a Clean Ganga. While attending an event last year, I was elated to witness both citizens and organisations pledging themselves to this cause. Making Ganga and our other rivers clean cannot be a mission of the Government alone. It has to be our collective endeavour and our collective promise. 


 


	As citizens we must contribute to this cause. For instance, we recently celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi and Navratras are a few days away. We need to ensure that the idols of deities immersed in the rivers are made of environment-friendly materials. It will help keep the rivers clean and ensure the safety of marine life. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	A few days from now, on 2nd October we will be celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. It will also mark the official completion of the Swachha Bharat Abhiyan. Over the past five years, Swachha Bharat Abhiyan saw participation of people from all strata of society as well as organisations, who took responsibility and made it their personal mission. I was pleased to felicitate few such Swachhta crusaders earlier this month in this very hall, as part of the Swachh Mahaotsav 2019. Today, we have achieved almost full sanitation coverage and the country is on the verge of becoming open defecation free. We all need to show the same dedication and commitment towards Jal Shakti Abhiyan. 


 


	The Central and State Governments are already collaborating on water conservation activities in the most water stressed blocks and districts of the country. Focused interventions for rain water harvesting and water conservation, including the restoration and renovation of traditional water bodies are being planned. I also acknowledge the several NGOs working for water conservation across the country. And there are numerous techno-entrepreneurs who are developing and implementing innovative technology solutions for improving our water management. I am sure that the Jal Shakti Ministry would build partnerships and work with all stakeholders to make the pursuit of assured water availability to each citizen, a Jan Andolan. 


 


	While we seek solutions to address different water-related issues, we should not lose sight of our age-old methods of conserving water. A blending of our traditional knowledge with modern technologies and techniques can help us become a water secure nation. Let us pledge to achieve our water-related goals with robust cooperation among all our states, public and private organisations and our people.


 


	I wish all of you and the India Water Week - 2019 all success.


Thank You!

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the 6th India Water Week-2019, today (September 24, 2019) at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi. The theme of the India Water Week-2019 is ‘Water Cooperation – Coping with 21st Century Challenges’ and it is being organised by the Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, the Ministry of Jal Shakti. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that cooperation between different stakeholders is critical, if we are to face the challenges concerning water effectively. Water issues are too multi-faceted and complex to be solved by only the government or just one nation. All nations and their water communities have to come together to help build a water sustainable future for all. 

The President said that we often talk of reducing our “carbon-footprint”.  It is time we talk to reducing our “water-footprint” as well. Our farmers, corporate leaders and government bodies need to actively consider the “water-footprint’’ of different crops and industries. We need to encourage agricultural and industrial practices that have the least water-footprint.   

The President said that managing and mapping ground-water resources is also an important aspect of water governance. The widespread use of boring machines has led to unregulated and excessive exploitation of ground-water. We have to value our ground-water and be responsible. We have to ensure that our precious rainwater does not get wasted. We need to store and capture our rainwater by utilizing our existing reservoirs, dams, other water bodies and by adopting water harvesting measures in our homes and neighbourhoods. 

The President said that while we seek solutions to address different water-related issues, we should not lose sight of our age-old methods of conserving water. A blending of our traditional knowledge with modern technologies and techniques can help us become a water secure nation. He called upon all stakeholders to pledge to achieve water-related goals with robust cooperation among all states, public and private organisations and people. He said that over the past five years, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan saw participation of people from all strata of society as well as organisations, who took responsibility and made it their personal mission. We all need to show the same dedication and commitment towards Jal Shakti Abhiyan. 

The President said that the ‘National Mission for Clean Ganga’ entails numerous projects to ensure the continuous and unpolluted flow of the Ganga. He emphasized that making Ganga and our other rivers clean cannot be a mission of the Government alone. It has to be our collective endeavour and our collective promise. He said that as citizens we must contribute to this cause. For instance, we recently celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi and Navratras are a few days away. We need to ensure that the idols of deities immersed in the rivers are made of environment-friendly materials. It will help keep the rivers clean and ensure the safety of marine life.

                A group of 169 IAS officers of the 2017 batch, currently attached to  different Ministries and Departments of the Government of India as Assistant Secretaries, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (September 23, 2019) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Addressing the officers, the President said that while discharging their responsibilities, they would have to look at approaches that give optimum results. They must emphasize on teamwork and take everybody along and recognize everybody’s contribution. And while they do so, they must lead and be a role-model. They must also encourage greater people’s participation in socio-economic programmes, especially where they are dealing with mindsets and attitudes. He said that administration is no more about “us” and “them”, but only about “us” and “us together”. The gap between government and people must go. He said that officers’ approach should be people-sensitive and people-centric. We are duty bound to enhance “Ease of Living” for our people. 

The President said that IAS officers are at the cutting-edge of implementation and their role is paramount if India is to transform itself to a 5 trillion economy, to double farm-income, to achieve social justice and to make women equal stakeholders in our progress.  He said that the officers had worked hard and with sincerity to reach thus far in life.  They must continue with the same zeal and dedication to serve the people of India.

                1.   Excellency, I warmly welcome you on your State Visit to India. It is a singular honour for me to host you and your esteemed delegation. You have made it even more special for us by accepting my invitation to stay at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Our ancient traditions teach us to be not just warm and welcoming to our guests, but to honour them with the spirit of “Atithi Devo Bhava”, that is to respect guests like God. We are grateful that you have given us this special opportunity to celebrate our age-old friendship. 

2.      India and Mongolia share close civilisational ties.  Buddhist heritage and spiritual traditions bind us together. We also share the ideals of democracy and freedom. Your visit is an important milestone in our Strategic Partnership. Its outcome and its warmth shall keep our friendship glowing.    

3.      Excellency, our centuries-old people-to-people exchanges have been the bedrock of our ties. Buddhist monks and traders from India traveled to Mongolia with the message of peace, harmony and friendship. Similarly, over the ages, Mongolian scholars and pilgrims came to India in pursuit of Buddhist studies and spiritual blessings. This ageless tradition continues. India, today, is privileged to host around 800 Mongolian students engaged in Buddhist studies. 

4.      Mr. President, we both have done well to preserve our Buddhist ties and take them forward. A few days ago our two countries organized SAMVAD THREE: the Global Dialogue for Peaceful Co-existence, Inter-religious understanding and Inter-dependent sustainability. Excellency, this morning you and my Prime Minister jointly unveiled the statue of Lord Buddha at the historic Gandan Monastery in Ulaanbaatar.  May he ever guide and bless us.  

5.      Excellency, India and Mongolia are not just “spiritual neighbours"" but strategic partners as well. We appreciate your ‘third neighbour’ policy. Our convergence of views on global issues makes our Strategic Partnership deep and meaningful.  

6.      Since the historic visit of my Prime Minister to Mongolia in 2015, our cooperation in diverse fields including defence, security, culture, IT, space and renewable energy has deepened. We are happy to partner Mongolia for capacity building and training. The Oil Refinery Project being built by us in Mongolia will stand as a shining example of our development partnership.  

7.    Excellency, Mongolia has given the world many values.  Your nomadic culture and your love for nature have deeply influenced both the eastern and western thought. You have combined material culture with spiritual well-being, as none other. Where else but in Mongolia, do we find the speed of the horse and the mark of the archer being balanced by peaceful spiritual traditions and the power of the deep meditative mind.  We all have, indeed, learnt a lot from you.  

8.      Excellency, India remains committed to working with the Government and people of Mongolia to further strengthen and expand our Strategic Partnership for the prosperity of our two peoples.

9.      Excellency, I wish you a fulfilling stay in India. I am confident that your State Visit will add yet another glorious chapter to our historic ties. May our friendship ever grow and prosper in the divine shade of the Mahabodhi tree!  

Thank you!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received His Excellency Mr Khaltmaagiin Battulga, the President of Mongolia, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (September 20, 2019). He also hosted a banquet in his honour.

Welcoming President Battulga to India, the President said this is the first visit of a Mongolian President in the last ten years. He expressed confidence that this visit will be a milestone in India-Mongolia bilateral relationship.

The President said that India greatly values its close and friendly relations with Mongolia. We are not just 'strategic partners' but also 'spiritual neighbours' connected by our shared Buddhist heritage. He was happy to note that bilateral relations between the countries are now expanding into economic cooperation in several areas of importance like infrastructure, space and digital connectivity. Both sides are also cooperating closely in the fields of cyber security, information technology, disaster management, mining and animal husbandry.

The President appreciated Mongolia for its consistent support to India’s candidature for permanent membership of the UN Security Council. He also appreciated Mongolia’s decision to join the 'International Solar Alliance’. He said that this will strengthen our partnership in the renewable energy sector and help us combat Climate Change. 

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that centuries-old people-to-people exchanges have been the bedrock of our ties. Buddhist monks and traders from India traveled to Mongolia with the message of peace, harmony and friendship. Similarly, over the ages, Mongolian scholars and pilgrims came to India in pursuit of Buddhist studies and spiritual blessings. This ageless tradition continues. India, today, is privileged to host around 800 Mongolian students engaged in Buddhist studies.

The President said that India remains committed to working with the Government and people of Mongolia to further strengthen and expand our Strategic Partnership for the prosperity of our two peoples.

                On the concluding day (September 17, 2019) of his visit to Slovenia, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, attended the Indian community and Friends of India reception in Ljubljana, hosted by Shri Param Jit Mann, Ambassador of India to Slovenia.    

Addressing the gathering, the President said that Indian community in Slovenia are the prism through which the Slovenian people see India. Their hard work, success and warmth for the local people have contributed to building a positive image of India in this country.

 The President urged the Indian community to visit India, and experience the transformative changes happening. He said that our globally connected, technologically savvy and enterprising youth are at the forefront of this change.  We seek Indian Diaspora’s support and participation in creating a New India, an India where there is progress and prosperity for all. 

The President also appreciated Friends of India in Slovenia for their love for India and for Indian customs, beliefs and way of life. He said that the role that they have played in enhancing understanding between India and Slovenia is commendable. He also appreciated the efforts they have put in creating a network of cultural institutions, dance and Yoga schools, Ayurveda centers and Indian restaurants. 

Yesterday (September 16, 2019), the President addressed the India-Slovenia Business Forum in Ljubljana. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that today, India is the fastest growing major economy in the world. Slovenian companies will find in India a transformed business climate, a good measure of which is India’s extraordinary jump of 65 places during the last five years on the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index. The introduction of the path-breaking Goods and Services Tax has transformed India, a country of 1.3 billion people, into One Nation, One Tax, and One Market for the first time in its history. 

The President said that the infrastructure landscape in India is making rapid progress. Next generation projects, from high speed railways to country wide expressways, are being created apace. Digital connectivity is giving major thrust to e-commerce, e-services and fintech sectors. India’s Rupay payment card is making deeper headway in the international market. The international business community has given a vote of confidence to these changes by choosing India as the most preferred destination for Foreign Direct Investment. In 2018-19, we received FDI worth US$ 44.3 billion. Indian industry is also reaching out to the world, be it through trade, direct investments or joint collaborations. Both India and Slovenia have their economic strengths and can complement each other for mutual growth and prosperity, he said. 

The President said that Slovenia has strengths in high-technology, research, innovation, smart solutions and small-scale precision manufacturing. Slovenian Smart Specialization Strategy and Indian growth make for a new-age partnership. We would like Slovenia to collaborate with us in our flagship programmes - Make in India, Clean India, Start-up India and Digital India. We want to leverage Slovenian knowhow in the environmental sector. We are also keen to learn from Slovenia in the field of urban infrastructure and waste management. 

The President said that Indian strengths in the fields of IT, pharma, biotech, healthcare services, automobile, ayurveda, energy and infrastructure, can be harnessed by Slovenia for its growth.  India can also be a partner in Slovenia’s development by providing skilled resource in technology intensive sectors.   

Yesterday, the President also met the President of the National assembly of Slovenia, Mr Dejan Židan. Later in the evening (September 17, 2019), the President will emplane for New Delhi after the successful completion of his state visit to –Iceland, Switzerland and Slovenia.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind reached Ljubljana, Slovenia, yesterday (September 15, 2019) in the final leg of his visit to – Iceland, Switzerland and Slovenia. This is the first ever presidential visit from India to Slovenia. 

Today (September 16, 2019), the President commenced his engagements with visit to the Congress Square where he was received by President Borut Pahor of Slovenia and accorded a ceremonial welcome. The two Presidents also paid tributes at the Victims of All Wars.  

During the subsequent one-to-one discussions with President Pahor, the President said that he was honoured to pay the first ever State Visit from India to Slovenia. The two leaders discussed possible collaboration between the two nations on a wide range of issues. 

Subsequently, the President led delegation-level talks between the two sides. Speaking on the occasion, the President was happy to note that India-Slovenia bilateral trade is picking up and Indian and Slovenian companies are finding new opportunities to do business together. He said that there is significant potential to increase bilateral trade by diversifying our trade basket. 

The President said that India’s growth and Slovenia’s technology and manufacturing capacity complement each other. India is targeting to become a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2025. There are immense possibilities of cooperation between the two countries in the fields of high technology, especially clean technology, robotics and artificial intelligence. Start-up and innovation sectors also present opportunities. Slovenia has developed niche technology in the defence sector and is a proven leader in the field of Artificial Intelligence, defence equipment and clean water technologies. 

Pointing out the India-Slovenia relations in multilateral fora, the President said that India values Slovenia’s support for India’s candidature for permanent membership in an expanded UN Security Council. He said that there is a need to strengthen multilateral institutions and we should work together on this issue. President Kovind thanked President Pahor for Slovenia’s support for India’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council and sought his continued support for India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

On the issue on Climate change and environment, the President urged Slovenia to join the International Solar Alliance and strengthen India’s efforts to combat climate change. 

The President said that terrorism is one of the biggest challenges confronting us. He thanked Slovenia for understanding and supporting India on issues of core concern including cross-border terrorism. Both sides also agreed that terrorism was one of the gravest challenges confronting humanity today and that the world should come together to defeat and destroy these evil forces.  

India and Slovenia signed and exchanged seven MoUs and Programmes of Cooperation in the fields of Investment, Sports, Culture, River Rejuvenation (Clean Ganga Mission), Science & Technology and Standards in the presence of the two Presidents.

Later, the President met Prime Minister Marjan Šarec of Slovenia at the Ljubljana Castle on a working lunch.  During the conversations, the two leaders discussed a range of bilateral and global issues. 

Later in the evening, the President will address the India-Slovenia Business event and also attend a banquet hosted in his honour by the President of Slovenia.

	I thank you for your warm and traditional welcome. I am honoured to unveil the bust of Mahatma Gandhi in Villeneuve. This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of Our Nation. I thank the Commune of Villeneuve for giving us the opportunity to celebrate his legacy here and for naming this Square after him. 



	Mahatma Gandhi shared special connection with this beautiful town.  He visited Villeneuve in 1931 at the invitation of Noble laureate Romain Rolland. Those, of course, were different times. India was still fighting for its independence led by the Mahatma. His teachings, though, continue to be relevant today, as much as then. The United Nations quite fittingly observes 2 October each year, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, as the International Day of Non-Violence. 



	Mahatma Gandhi’s life teaches us many things. He built his first hermitage in India on the banks of River Sabarmati. Today, we have brought him to the banks of Lake Geneva. You have given him a special place, close to nature and close to your hearts. It is a fitting tribute to a man who loved nature and cared so much for it.  His legacy shall inspire us as we work together to tackle climate change and to conserve our ecology. 



	Mahatma Gandhi believed in the oneness of humanity. He embraced all cultures and all peoples. He listened to Hindu religious songs and western classical music with equal ease and understanding. In Villeneuve, Romain Rolland played Beethoven for him. They had long conversations on the Great War that had ravaged Europe and how peace could be secured for future generations. As two democracies with deep respect for diversity, Mahatma Gandhi shall continue to guide us in our shared journey to bring peace and joy for one and all.  



	Gandhian thought has yet another connection with you. The communes have a distinct social and political role in Swiss democratic polity. It is very much similar to the way Mahatma Gandhi laid down his concept of Gram Swaraj or Village Republics. 



	Last year, we celebrated the 70th Anniversary of the India-Switzerland Treaty of Friendship signed in 1948. This was the first Treaty of Friendship that India signed as an independent nation. The seed of amity that we sowed then, has today grown into a luxuriant tree of mutual trust, cooperation and understanding.  



	I once again thank the commune of Villeneuve and all those who have contributed in organizing this special event.  


 

Thank you.

	Switzerland-India partnership is a special one. Economic engagement along with innovation and science and technology has been its key drivers. We have together created wealth and business opportunities for ourselves and for the world. I thank President Maurer for his august presence here and for his support for Indo-Swiss relations.  In our talks just a while ago, we once again placed primacy on enhancing our business links, one that would contribute to growth and to sustainability. President Maurer also holds the Finance portfolio. For this reason, enhancing economic ties are very close to his heart.



	I commend the Business Chambers of Switzerland and India for organizing this India-Switzerland Business Roundtable. I thank Economiesuisse and the Confederation of Indian Industry for their presentations and for organizing the business delegations.


Ladies and gentlemen,


	Most here are aware of the Indian growth story. We are aiming to become a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2025. We are the fastest growing major economy today. We are transforming our country and the way we do business. Our efforts are showing results. We have jumped 65 positions on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. Banking reforms have been introduced to enhance financial stability. Formalization of economy is taking place with increase in cashless transactions. Digital economy and fintech sectors are breaking new grounds. India’s Rupay card is gaining greater market abroad. The landmark introduction of the Goods and Services Tax has converted India into a single tax market for the first time in its history.  


Ladies and gentlemen,


	We live in a fast changing business world. A quality innovation ecosystem is necessary to keep pace with the disruptive shifts taking place. To be ahead of the curve, we have launched an ambitious Start-up India programme. We are home to the third largest Start-up network in the world with over 21,000 enterprises. Our 30 unicorns are valued at over 90 billion US dollars.  Swiss Start-up ecosystem is equally impressive. We must join hands and add value to each other. 



	Today, India has one of the world’s largest renewable energy programmes. Globally, India stands 4th in wind power and 5th in solar and overall renewable power capacity. Our target is to achieve 175 Giga Watts of renewable energy by 2022. We have also set a target to get 6 to 7 million electric and hybrid vehicles on the road by 2020.  


Ladies and gentlemen,


	I am happy that Swiss business is increasingly engaging India. Today, there are over 250 Swiss companies present in India. It includes different business models - from sales to manufacturing for exports to third countries. This operational diversity reflects the confidence of Swiss investors in the Indian economy. 



	Switzerland is home to high-end technology and India is producing world class human capital. India ranks as a major global player in areas such as pharmaceuticals, healthcare services, information technology, solar energy, automobiles, space and biotechnology. Our two economies are highly complementary. There is vast scope to combine our relative advantages in capital, technology, science and skills for mutual benefit. 



	We have received Swiss participation in our flagship Make in India, Smart Cities, Digital India, Clean India, Startup India and Skill India programmes. With almost half of India’s population, that is 600 million people, below the age of 25 years, and about 550 million people as labour force; India has abundant and youthful human resources. 



	We welcome Swiss companies to further invest and engage in our transformation and our growth. We have set up an online portal, India Investment Grid, to showcase investment opportunities across India.  I encourage you to visit it. 



	I am confident that your discussions today will contribute to further strengthening India-Switzerland trade and investment relations. 


Thank you.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, unveiled a statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Villeneuve, Switzerland today (September 14, 2019) in the presence of Mayor and President of Canton Vaud and other dignitaries. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Mahatma Gandhi’s life teaches us many things. He built his first hermitage in India on the banks of River Sabarmati. Today, we have brought him to the banks of Lake Geneva. It is a fitting tribute to a man who loved nature and cared so much for it. His legacy shall inspire us as we work together to tackle climate change and to conserve our ecology.

The President said that Mahatma Gandhi believed in the oneness of humanity. He embraced all cultures and all peoples. As two democracies with deep respect for diversity, Mahatma Gandhi shall continue to guide us in our shared journey to bring peace and joy for one and all. 

Yesterday, the President led the delegation level talks along with President Ueli Maurer of the Swiss Confederation and witnessed the signing and exchange of MOUs/agreements between two countries. He also addressed the India-Switzerland Business Roundtable.

During the delegation-level talks, both sides agreed that terrorism poses a grave challenge to humanity. President Kovind conveyed that India had been a victim of state sponsored terrorism for decades. The Swiss side extended its support to strengthen fight against terrorism in all its manifestations.

President Kovind said that trade and economic relations constitute the essence of India-Switzerland bilateral ties. Switzerland is the largest exporter to India from Europe. Our bilateral trade volume stands at around US$ 19 billion. He said that India is committed to expand its trading ties further.

The two sides also discussed the sharing of information on tax matters under the Automatic Exchange of Information framework. The sharing of information is scheduled to commence later this month.

The President said that India is keen to enhance its skill partnership and learn more from Swiss vocational education system. India is also interested in partnering Switzerland in areas such as Industry 4.0, biotechnology, life sciences, telecommunications, railway infrastructure sector, aviation and renewable energy. 

India and Switzerland signed and exchanged agreements/MOUs for cooperation in the field of Climate Change; Letter of Intent to create an India-Switzerland Science and Innovation Alliance; and for renewal of the Hindi Chair at the University of Lausanne.

Speaking at the Business Roundtable, the President said that Switzerland is home to high-end technology and India is producing world class human capital. India ranks as a major global player in areas such as pharmaceuticals, healthcare services, information technology, solar energy, automobiles, space and biotechnology. Our two economies are highly complementary. There is vast scope to combine our relative advantages in capital, technology, science and skills for mutual benefit.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, along with Mr Ueli Maurer, the President of the Swiss Confederation, addressed the Federal Council of Switzerland in Berne today (September 13, 2019). The Federal Council is the highest executive authority in Switzerland. It comprises seven members, who are elected by the Federal Assembly. 

In his address, President Kovind said that India - Switzerland partnership has made significant progress. Our complementary strengths make us natural partners. India is the world’s fastest growing major economy. We have set a target to become a 5 trillion economy by 2025. Around 65 percent of our population is below 35 years of age. Our youth has the drive, energy and confidence to script the machine-intelligence age and to draw the contours of the 4th Industrial Revolution. We are skilling and empowering them to convert our demographic profile into demographic dividend. We count on Switzerland’s cooperation to make them drivers of our growth and prosperity. 

The President was happy to note that India-Switzerland will have the first automatic exchange of information on tax matters in the coming weeks. He said that it is a very positive development. The President highlighted the linkages between tax evasion and money laundering with terrorism. He said that the scourge of terrorism is among the gravest challenges that the world faces today. India has been a victim of state sponsored terrorism for decades and it seeks Switzerland’s support to enhance global efforts to defeat and destroy all manifestations of terrorism, he said. 

The President emphasised that there is a need to strengthen India-Switzerland joint work in the multilateral arena. He said that in order to be effective, international institutions need to reflect the realities of the contemporary world. He thanked Switzerland for its consistent support for India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. He said that India is committed to work with Switzerland to fight climate change. India also looks forward to Switzerland joining the International Solar Alliance. 

Later today (13.09.2019), the President will lead the delegation level talks with his counterpart, witness the signing of MOUs/agreements and address the India-Switzerland Business CEOs Forum. He will also attend a banquet hosted by the Swiss President in the evening.  

Meanwhile, yesterday evening (September 12, 2019), the President attended Indian Community and Friends of India reception hosted by Shri Sibi George, Ambassador of India to Switzerland in Berne.  Addressing the gathering, the President said that India is proud of its vibrant and diverse diaspora which has earned respect throughout the world. In Switzerland our Diaspora include members of Federal and Cantonal Parliaments, CEOs and senior executives of several companies, senior Government officials, professors, doctors, engineers and medical professionals. We also have an increasing number of Indian students at premier Swiss Universities. All of them are the bridge that brings our two countries closer to each other. He appreciated Indian Embassy and the Indian Associations in Switzerland for the growing cultural engagement between our two peoples.

Over 80 scientific institutions and 300 researchers from India and Switzerland have connected with each other on joint programmes.

 

The President said that Switzerland is a world leader on innovation. India is also making new strides in the fields of Start-ups and smart solutions. India today hosts the third largest start-up network in the world with over 21,000 enterprises working on subjects as varied as robotics and vitiligo. Several Swiss and Indian start-ups have already join hands to create solutions for climate change, human health and more. India looks forward to many more such partnerships with Switzerland. 

 

The President said that India has an ambitious programme to build 100 smart cities. Swiss expertise in circular economy and resource efficient knowhow can help us to build sustainable urban space, to clean our rivers and to process our food. Swiss clean technology and Indian green energy requirements are smart suitors to each other. Today, India has one of the world’s largest renewable energy expansion programmes. Our target is to have 175 Giga Watts of renewable power capacity by the year 2022. 

 

The President said that India has nearly 20 percent of the world’s population with about 4 percent of the world’s renewable water resources. We are reviving traditional methods of water conservation and adopting modern innovations to reduce surface flow. Our new national water Mission – Jal Jeevan Abhiyan – with an investment of over 50 billion US dollars, aims to provide clean tap water to around 146 million households by 2024. The Mission opens new opportunities for Indo-Swiss collaboration. India wants to engage Switzerland on water governance, water use efficiency and treatment of waste water.

 

Later in the evening, the President will address the Indian Community and Friends of India at a reception hosted by Shri Sibi George, Ambassador of India to Switzerland in Berne.

	Let me begin by remembering the victims of the 9/11 terror attack in the US. On the occasion, let us once again resolve not to allow these inhuman forces to destroy our peace and harmony. 


 


	I am pleased to address the India-Iceland Business Forum. I thank President Johannesson for his august presence here. Our joint participation is an indication of our commitment to deepen India-Iceland economic ties. 


 


	I thank the India-Iceland Business Association, the Icelandic Federation of Trade, the Icelandic-India Trade Council, Promote Iceland, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India and the Confederation of Indian Industry who have come together to organize this Forum. We have over 30 companies from India here and many more from Iceland. I am happy about the excellent turnout.


 


	Yesterday, I had wide-ranging discussions with President Johannesson. We agreed to take forward and broaden our bilateral ties, in particular trade and investment relations. When you think of India and Iceland, an imagination of distance immediately comes to mind. But think of new-age technology, climate-smart solutions and blue economy, and you will realize how close Iceland and India are. India’s growth and commitment to sustainability and Iceland’s business strengths make for a natural partnership. 


 


	Iceland’s capacity in the fields of geothermal energy, circular economy, financial services, fisheries, food processing, shipping, tourism and innovation are second to none.  It is a pioneer in green technologies, be it carbon capture, energy efficient buildings or waste-to-wealth projects. Its economic success is a story that many would like   to emulate. India’s transformative growth programmes such as Digital India, Smart Cities, Clean India and next-generation infrastructure projects present immense opportunities for Icelandic companies. The case for deeper economic interaction between Iceland and India could not be more compelling! 


 

Ladies and gentlemen, 


	As with Iceland, Indian economic landscape is also an inspiring one. India is the sixth largest economy in the world today. We have set a target to reach the 5 trillion dollar economy mark by 2025. We are not only the fastest growing major economy, but have also become a leading engine of global growth. We are committed to further reforming our economy and making it ever more conducive for business. In the last five years, our sustained efforts in this regard have led to a spectacular jump of 65 places for India on the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index.  We have also moved 44 ranks on the Logistics Performance Index. Our seminal reform, the introduction of Goods and Services Tax, has made India into a single tax market for the first time in its history. As a result of our policies, we have attracted an impressive 44.3 billion US dollars as FDI in the financial year 2018-19. India is growing fast and transforming itself faster! 


 


	As I said earlier, India’s growth and Iceland’s niche capacities complement each other. There is scope to enhance economic partnership in several areas - from trade, investment, services to research and innovation. Our bilateral trade figures are modest. But Indian market and Iceland’s business strengths can add significant numbers to them. Iceland can look at sourcing manufactured goods, fruits and vegetables, textiles, chemicals and engineering goods from India.  Indian pharma Industry has much to offer. Every 5th tablet, capsule and injection in Generic Drugs in the world is manufactured in India. Iceland has made advances in genomics, genetics and biotechnology. It also possesses key technologies in the medical devices field. There is a lot that can happen between India and Iceland in the pharma, healthcare and biotech space. Finance, hospitality and tourism services also present significant opportunities. 


 


	 Food industry is another potential area of collaboration. India is the second largest food producer in the world. We require technology and investment support to process our food and modern logistics chain to market it. We are also keen to learn from Iceland’s sustainable management of fish stock and innovative fishery products - from fish-skin leather to cosmetics. We are looking at Iceland as an important partner as we work to double our farm-income by 2022.  


 

Ladies and gentlemen, 


	India’s growth is creating immense opportunities in the infrastructure, start-up and digital sectors. Smart cities, green buildings, airports, expressways, high speed railways and ports are fast changing the landscape of India. Our digital India programme is running at speed.  Over a billion people have been provided with digital identity. Broadband connectivity is reaching every village and every hamlet.  With the cheapest data price in the world, public services, from banking to municipal documentation, are being delivered through the digital i-way.  India is a world leader in IT services and Iceland a preferred destination for hosting data centers. There are opportunities for the two sides to collaborate in the digital space and in next-generation infrastructure projects. 


 


	  Iceland is known for renewable energy – geothermal and hydroelectricity.  There is scope for collaboration in this sector as well. India has set itself a target of installing 175 Giga Watts capacity of renewable energy by the year 2022, and meeting 40% of its total energy needs from renewable energy by the year 2030. In our ever-growing commitment to renewable energy, India would also be turning towards utilization of geothermal energy in the coming future. Wind energy is yet another area of cooperation. India ranks fourth in the world in terms of wind energy generation. We also have a dynamic domestic industry manufacturing wind turbines.  Our companies are ready to engage with Iceland to harness wind energy. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen, 


	We have talked of the present. Let us also elaborate on the future. Iceland’s technological prowess and India’s scientific skills could embrace each other to drive the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the machine-intelligence age. Our   Start-ups working on robotics, ecology and marine litter can be the potential anchors of our future engagement, in Iceland, India or in any other part of the world. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen, 


	I have highlighted some of the areas where our economic cooperation holds potential. You will know more of them as you sit across the table and talk to each other, as potential business partners and as friends. And as you do so, you must share stories of the beauty of Icelandic glaciers and the magic of Bollywood. Businesses fructify and flourish when they happen over warmth and friendship! I wish all of you a fulfilling day of business engagement. 


 

Takk Firir!

Thank you!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind landed in Reykjavik, Iceland, yesterday (September 9, 2019) in the first leg of his visit to – Iceland, Switzerland and Slovenia. This is the first visit of an Indian President to Iceland since the visit of Dr Kalam in 2005.

 

Today (September 10, 2019), the President commenced his engagements with visit to Bessastadir Presidential Residence where he was received by Mr Gudni Johannesson, the President of Iceland and accorded a ceremonial welcome.

 

During the subsequent one-to-one discussions with President Johannesson, the President thanked him for warm reception and hospitality. He appreciated Iceland’s lead in tackling climate change and managing the health of oceans. He assured India’s steadfast support on both these counts. The President congratulated him for Iceland taking over as chair of the Arctic Council in May 2019. He said that India, as an observer, would actively participate and contribute to the deliberations. Subsequently, the President led delegation-level talks between the two sides.

 

Both sides agreed that terrorism poses a grave threat to humanity and committed to work together to strengthen the global fight against terrorism. President Kovind thanked President Johannesson for his understanding for India’s core concerns; India has been a victim of cross border terrorism for several decades. Both sides agreed that terrorism was the worst violation of basic human rights and it needs to be dealt with strongly in whichever form it appears.

 

On the economic side, there is significant potential to strengthen Iceland-India partnership. Both sides discussed how ways and means to expand trade, investment, technology and innovation collaborations. With India having set a target to become a five trillion dollar economy by 2025, India’s transformative growth and Iceland’s technology and know-how can add immense value to each other.

 

India agreed to cooperate closely with Iceland on climate change, marine litter and other environment related issues. The President said that India wants to combine its economic progress with clean technology. He expressed that India is keen to leverage Iceland’s capacity in sustainable fishery, marine economy, shipping, green growth, energy, construction and agriculture sectors. Meanwhile, Indian companies can offer opportunities to Iceland in the fields of pharma, high-end IT services, biotechnology, automobile, innovation and start-ups.

 

India and Iceland also signed and exchanged three agreements in fields of fisheries collaboration, cultural cooperation and visa waiver for holders of diplomatic and official passport. President Kovind announced that teaching of Hindi language at University of Iceland will begin shortly and that all formalities for setting up that India supported Hindi Chair at the University of Iceland have been completed.

 

A press statement made by President Kovind on the occasion is attached. 

 

Later in the day, the President addressed the students and faculty members of the University of Iceland on the theme “India-Iceland for a Greener planet”.

 

The President said that today, we have an increasing number of global forums where we are discussing environment protection, biodiversity conservation, carbon sinks and green growth. And yet, despite extensive knowledge on the subject, we are witness to rapidly melting glaciers and ice caps, extreme weather events, depleting marine resources, receding forests and shrinking of biodiversity. Clearly, increase in knowledge and availability of scientific evidence have not led to adequate practical action to deal with climate change and environmental degradation.

 

The President said that India is today the world’s fastest growing major economy and we require a huge expansion of our energy production. But we are doing it in a sustainable manner. Even as we grow, we are on course to meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement.

 

The President said that India has pledged to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022. He also said that in order to conserve water and ensure piped water availability across the country, India has undertaken an ambitious national water programme. It would nourish our ecology and habitat, while quenching the thirst of millions.

 

In the evening, the President will attend a banquet hosted in his honour by the President of Iceland. 

 

Yesterday evening (September 9, 2019), the President attended the Indian Community and Friends of India Reception, hosted by Shri T. Armstrong Changsan, Ambassador of India to Iceland. 

 

The President said that India is on a transformational growth path. We have set a target to become a five trillion dollar economy by 2025. Major reform process is underway. He invited Indian diaspora to be part of India’s transformative journey. He said that they have an important role to play in forging technology, investment, tourism and cultural links and strengthening India’s ties with Iceland and the world.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the Swachh Mahotsav 2019, a function held at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi today (September 6, 2019), organised by the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti. On the occasion, the President presented the Swachh Bharat Awards in various categories. He also received the Swachh Bharat Mission’s Book on Behavior Change Communication from Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Union Minister of Jal Shakti, who formally released it.

 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that the biggest feature of ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ is that it has become a campaign of every Indian, not just a government campaign. Everyone has taken up the task of cleanliness as his/her own responsibility. He noted that Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations are to be achieved by 2030. But, India is set to achieve cleanliness targets 11 years ahead, that is in 2019 itself. He said that it is a matter of pride for us and every citizen of the country deserves appreciation for this achievement.

 

The President said that a new awareness has emerged in our society through Swachhta Abhiyan. He emphasized that goals of the next phase should be achieved while strengthening the success of the first phase. We have to pay attention towards the maintenance of the facilities set up during the first phase. He said that for this, we have to imbibe the culture of cleanliness more deeply.

 

The President said that we have to move forward, adopting the broader meaning of cleanliness. For example, providing clean drinking water also comes under the purview of sanitation. Cleanliness is also an essential condition for the success of 'Jal Jeevan Mission' launched by the Government of India this year.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented National Awards to meritorious teachers from across the country at a function held at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi today (September 5, 2019) on the occasion of Teachers’ Day.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that strong foundations of character-building are laid in schools. The main objective of education is to make the student a good human-being. And teachers do so by instilling honesty, discipline and integrity in their students. A good human-being possessing these values ​​will prove to be good in each and every sphere. By ensuring that their students become good human beings, teachers contribute in the nation-building process.

The President said that today, the world is moving from information era to knowledge era. However, knowledge alone will not be able to ensure the safety of human civilization. Along with knowledge, it is also necessary to have a conscience. Only when knowledge is combined with wisdom, it can solve human problems. In this globalized and highly competitive world, we have to establish a balance between ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘human compassion’ and between ‘digital learning’ and ‘character building’. Only on the basis of such rational knowledge, we can tackle the present challenges such as climate change, pollution, melting glaciers etc. Teachers can contribute significantly in the national campaign of water conservation by instilling in students the importance of water conservation.

The President urged teachers to build a new generation that is full of knowledge and wisdom, so that it can successfully address all the contemporary challenges.

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, Union Minister for Human Resource Development and Shri Dhotre Sanjay Shamrao, Minister of State for Human Resource Development.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon the Corporate, philanthropists and eminent sports personalities in India to supplement the efforts of the government in building sports infrastructure, especially in the northeastern region. He said Government’s efforts to improve sports facilities must be supported by one and all. 

Interacting with about 20 young boxers from Mary Kom’s Regional Boxing Foundation in Imphal, Manipur, who are on a National Interactive Tour organized by the 15 Assam Rifles, in New Delhi today, Shri Naidu said that there was an urgent need to create the necessary environment for sports to thrive in the country to make India a global sports superpower. 

The Vice President lauded the government of India, for launching Khelo India campaign to identify, encourage and support sporting talent from all corners of the country by giving them top-notch infrastructure and training of the highest level.

Shri Naidu asked champions like Mary Kom, P.V. Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, Dipa Karmakar, and others take lead and inspire the youth, especially the children to take up sports. “There is an urgent need to take this to the grass-root level and create a strong framework for all types of sports in the country and make India a great sporting nation,” he added.

Stressing the need to revive the sporting culture and nurture it right from school age, the Vice President said that Games and Sports or Yoga or any physical activity must become integral to people’s daily routine.

Pointing out that staying fit and staying healthy would have a bearing on the wellbeing of a person, family and the society at large, he said that: “A youthful nation such as ours with more than 65% of the population under the age of 30 must encourage the children, the youth and the elders to stay fit by doing any form of physical activity.”

Referring to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s call asking the youth to visit at least 15 tourist destinations within India by 2022 to give a boost to domestic tourism, Shri Naidu said such visits would enhance their understanding of the unique cultural mosaic of the country.

Stating that traveling was an essential part of life and it teaches many things that could not be taught in the classroom, the Vice President asked youngsters, especially students to undertake ‘Bharat Dashan’to learn about various facets of India’s culture, heritage, languages, and cuisine. 

The Vice President showered special appreciation to Smt. Mary Kom and her Husband, Shri K. Onler Kom for establishing Regional Boxing Foundation to train children and youth from remote and far-flung areas of Manipur and other North-Eastern parts.  He complimented the 15 Assam Rifles for organizing the National Interactive tour for these boxers.

The spouse of the Vice President, Smt. Usha Naidu, representatives of 15 Assam Rifles and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I welcome all of you to Upa Rashtrapati Bhawan.

I am indeed happy and delighted to meet our gen-next sports stars who have been receiving training under the guidance of Champion Boxer Smt. Mary Kom.

I am glad to see boxers from remote and far-flung areas of Manipur and I compliment the Mary Kom Academy for encouraging the young talent.

Mary Kom is a massive source of inspiration for boxers across the country and around the world. Her life, struggles, and success are inspirational. Her love for boxing, dedication and hard work knocked out all the hurdles that came her way.

She is arguably the most successful boxer our nation has ever produced.

Other than being the only woman in the world to win the boxing world championship six times, Mary Kom is also an Asian Games (2014) gold medalist, a Commonwealth Games (2018) gold medalist, and an Olympic bronze medalist.

She is one of the best ambassadors for sports in India and abroad and now she is also a member of Parliament ( Rajya Sabha).

I appreciate Mary Kom and her husband Mr. K. Onler for taking up the responsibility of promoting the boxing sport amongst underprivileged youth of Manipur and other parts of North East India by providing training. I am told that the Foundation has the state-of-the-art facilities for students and learners. I am sure like all of you, many more would benefit from the academy.

I call upon corporates, philanthropists and eminent sports personalities in India to supplement the efforts of the government in building sports infrastructure, especially in the northeastern region. Government’s efforts to improve sports facilities must be supported by one and all.

I am quite confident that Indian boxers will bring laurels to the country at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo next year.

Dear Youngsters,

India, in the last few years has made steady progress in the field of sports and showcased its prowess at many global platforms.

It is the time that we aim to make India a global sports superpower by creating necessary environment for sportsmanship to thrive. I appreciate and compliment the government of India, for launching Khelo India campaign a few years back to identify, encourage and support sporting talent from all corners of the country by giving them top-notch infrastructure and training of the highest level.

Here I call upon champions like Mary Kom, PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, Dipa Karmakar, and others take lead and inspire the youth, especially the children to take up sports.

There is an urgent need to take this to the grass-root level and create strong framework for all types of sports in the country and make India a great sporting nation.

Sporting culture needs to be revived and nurtured right from school age.

Games and Sports or Yoga or any physical activity should become integral to people’s daily routine. It not only keeps one healthy but also helps keeps the mind stress free and provide relaxation to the mind and body.

Sports improve efficiency, inculcates team spirit, teaches the value of time and at the same time playing and watching a sport or a game could be a good great source of entertainment.

As all of us are aware, a healthy mind lives in a healthy body and it helps in more than one way. Staying fit and staying healthy will have a bearing on the wellbeing of a person, family and the society at large.

A youthful nation such as ours with more than 65% of the population under the age of 30 must encourage the children, the youth and the elders to stay fit by doing any form of physical activity.

I am happy that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s initiative “Fit India campaign” encourages people to stay fit and healthy.

I was told that all you have been visiting several historic places and meeting people from different walks of life including sports personalities in the trip.

Dear Friends,

Traveling is an essential part of our life and it teaches many things that cannot be taught in the classroom. It gives a perspective on issues, situations, and things once you venture out. Traveling is a great learning experience.

Delivering Independence Day speech from Red Fort, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon people, especially the youth to visit at least 15 tourist destinations within India by 2022 to give a boost to domestic tourism. I second that call and encourage all to do the same.

Youngsters, especially students of our country must undertake ‘Bharat Dashan’to learn about various facets of India’s culture, heritage, languages and cuisine and enhance their understanding of the unique cultural mosaic of the country. This understanding would help them devise ingenious and effective solutions to the challenges faced by the country today.

I think we must explore India first, especially the northeastern region of India, that is home to a remarkable biodiversity.

I take this opportunity to appreciate 15 Assam Rifles under the agies of Headquarter 9 Sector Assam Rifles and the Director-General for organizing this National Interactive tour for 20 boxers from Mary Kom Boxing Academy.

Thank You!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the epics like Ramayana reminds about ones pious duty to perform in the larger interest of the society and the country. He asked everyone take a small step on a daily and regular basis on issues of common good such as controlling pollution, saving water or preserving the environment and others to make the world a better place.

“The Ram Rajya is waiting to be realized. Our smallest contribution will help in realizing the ideal Ram Rajya – a truly enlightened ethical democratic society.” he added.

Addressing the gathering after inaugurating Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra’s Dance Drama 'SHRIRAM' in New Delhi today, the Vice President described the Ramayana as a heritage of the entire mankind and called for efforts to preserve, propagate and deepen peoples understanding of this immortal epic. “As we know, tradition is best preserved through constant re-creation,” he added

Saying that the epic of Ramayana reminds people of their duty towards the world, society, and family, Shri Naidu said that the epic also defines the relationship of human beings with each other, and with mother earth, nature, birds, and animals.

Talking about the core values of the Ramayana and its essence, the Vice President said that Ramleela was not meant only to recall and recreate the episodes in Lord Rama’s life and enjoy the taste of different Rasas that the performance would give the audience, but it makes people actually realize the message that life story of Rama and Sita has for all humanity.

Stating that Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram and Yogeshwer Krishna were the two characters, who for ages have guided mankind to a life of valor, virtues and spirituality, Shri Naidu said that Shri Ram, in all the stages and roles of his life on the earth, his thoughts and actions sought to establish the path of righteousness by carrying out the duties and setting standards of conduct.

Pointing out that technology brought mankind together and that everybody was a global citizen in the global-village, Shri Naidu observed that it was time to have distinct duties and responsibilities towards each other, towards nature and environment, towards all the beings and elements that make the world.

“We have to perfect the art of living together. This is the true spirit of our ideal of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.  This is the ideal of caring and sharing that is at the core of our philosophy,” he added.

The Chairman, Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra, Shri Deepak Singh, the Director, Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra, Smt. Shobha Deepak Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“मुझे बड़ी प्रसन्नता है कि आज भगवान श्रीराम के जीवन चरित्र का उत्सव मनाने के लिए एकत्र प्रबुद्व और प्रतिष्ठित अतिथिगण के बीच आने का अवसर मिला है। आपके आमंत्रण के लिए आप सभी का आभारी हूं। 

श्रीराम भारतीय कला केन्द्र द्वारा आयोजित नृत्य नाटिका “श्रीराम” का लोकार्पण करते हुए स्वयं को धन्य हुआ अनुभव कर रहा हूं। मुझे ज्ञात हुआ है कि नृत्य नाटिका की इस वार्षिक परंपरा का प्रारंभ 1957 में हुआ था। विगत 62 वर्षों से प्रति वर्ष इस कला को नये प्रयोगों से निरंत समृद्व किया गया है। इस उपलब्धि के लिए मैं आयोजकों और इस संस्थान की निदेशक श्रीमती शोभा दीपक सिंह जी का अभिनंदन करता हूं।

विगत 62 वर्षों में आपने रामकथा को हमारी धरोहर के रुप में संजोया है, उसको कला रुप में समृद्व किया है-उसका देश-विदेश में प्रसार-प्रचार किया है। आपके प्रयास अभिनंदनीय हैं।

The Ramleela of India is a folk tradition, which has been recognized by the UNESCO as world’s Intangible Cultural Heritage. In fact, many countries in Asia have their own rich traditions of Ramayana performances. Since ancient times, Lord Rama’s glorious tales have spread through the South East and Far East and became an integral part of the culture of countries of this region such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, Vietnam and even Japan and China. For some of these countries, the Ramayana is the national epic, while Thailand’s ancient capital was named after Ayodhya itself.  Closer home, the Ramayana tradition is shared with Srilanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The pervasive influence and presence of the Ramayana in the life and cultural traditions of East Asia since ancient times must be cherished and respected by all Indians.

The story of Lord Rama travelled with Indian Diaspora and became a part of the culture of countries like Mauritius, Fiji, Trinidad and all such places. Rama has always been a part of local folklore in every part of India. Now, I am told that there is a group in Russia performing the epic in the Russian language regularly for many years, while research is going on to find lord Rama’s footprints in the Middle East too.

Undoubtedly, Ramayana is a heritage of the entire mankind .We must make the best efforts to preserve, propagate and deepen our understanding of this immortal epic.

The sublimity and creativity of a culture is reflected in its art forms, its literature, its music, folklores and crafts. Often these art forms, folklore and music develop around a central character which carries all that is deemed as virtuous in a tradition. In India, Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram and Yogeshwer Krishna are the two such characters, who for  ages have guided us to  a life of valor, virtues and spirituality.

Rama was a prince of Ayodhya, but his exile took him to the remotest parts of the subcontinental geography. His exile gave him the opportunity to travel widely across the length and breadthof the country. Even today, every region, every community,  claims to have some bit of Rama. They own Rama, they closely associate and identify with Ram katha as their own. And the tradition is still alive and continuing. There is an emerging trend in recent Indian writings to re-interpret Ramayana, relocate its ethics in modern context and re-discover its historicity.      

Within India Lord Rama’s epic story has been written, recited and enacted since the time of the Puranas in almost all the major languages – from Sanskrit to Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Bengali, Assamese, Kashmiri, Punjabi and Urdu, besides the languages and dialects of Hindi region. There are more than 40 adaptations of Ramayana in the Telugu language itself.

Similarly, in the performing arts while the Ramleela tradition is popular in the theatre form of the north, the episodes from the epic have been enacted in major theatre forms of the different parts of the country such as Kathakali of Kerala, Therukoothu of Tamil Nadu, KuchipudiYakshaganam of Andhra, Yakshagana of Karnataka, Ankia Bhaona of Assam, amongst others.

There are more than 300 versions of Ramayana in Indian literary tradition and a larger number in our performing art traditions – in songs, ballads, dance and theatre forms of all the regions.

I am very glad to know that the Shriram Bharatiya Kaka Kendra has consciously sourced, collated and synthesized elements from many of these traditions of the country in creating its Ramleela.

I appreciate the efforts of the Kendra in conceptualizing and creating a vibrant collage of Ramleela in dance drama forms based on India’s varied traditions of classical and folk dances, classical and regional music, martial and acrobatic arts, masks and make-up styles and many other stage techniques and devices. I understand, that constant and continuous effort is being made and new experiments are being done to bring in new elements, technology and energy every year for keeping its Ramayana tradition alive and inspiring to the audience. As we know, tradition is best preserved through constant re-creation.

It is appropriate that the Government of Uttar Pradesh through its Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan honoured this Kendra as one of the five international organisations for their unparalleled contribution in the field of Ramleela.

Today, as we assemble here to enjoy a beautiful performance, let us pause and think what are the core values of the Ramayana, what is its essence. The Ramleela performance is not meant only to recall and recreate the episodes in Lord Rama’s life and enjoy the taste of different Rasas that the performance would give us. As we relate to the scenes on the stage and go through various emotions of joy, affection, love, sorrow, fear etc. we actually realize the message that the life story of Rama and Sita has for all humanity.

The epic of Ramayana reminds us of our duty towards the world, society and family. Ramayana defines the relationship of human beings with each other, and with mother earth, nature, birds and animals. Through his ‘Leelas’ Maryada Purushottam Rama exemplifies the best of virtues in these relationships and sets the highest of ideals for man to follow. In all the stages and roles of his life on the earth, his thoughts and actions seek to establish the path of righteousness by carrying out the duties and setting standards of conduct.

In our current times, this message gains new relevance and importance. The inexorable march of technology has brought the mankind together. As global citizens in a global village now we have distinct duties and responsibilities towards each other, towards nature and environment, towards all the beings and elements that make this world. We have to perfect the art of living together. This is the true spirit of our ideal of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. This is the ideal of caring and sharing that is at the core of our philosophy. We have a duty to perform in the larger interest of the society and the country.  Be it for controlling pollution, saving water or preserving the environment or any other similar issues of common good, each one has to take a small step on daily and regular basis. We have a sustainable, inclusive, peaceful and prosperous world beckoning us.  We have huge challenges but there are countless opportunities.  The Ram Rajya is waiting to be realized. Our smallest contribution will help in realizing the ideal Ram Rajya – a truly enlightened ethical democratic society.

आज जब पहली नवरात्रि के शुभ अवसर पर रामलीला के वार्षिक आयोजन का शुभारंभ कर रहे हैं, मैं आपसे आग्रह करूंगा कि हमारे आदर्श पुरुष मर्यादा पुरुषोत्तम श्री राम द्वारा दिखाये गये नैतिकता के मार्ग का सत्यनिष्ठा से अनुसरण करें। आइये हम सभी इस विलक्षण कृति को प्रस्तुत करने वाले कलाकारों, डिजाइनरों, स्टेज का निर्माण करने वाले शिल्पकारों, तकनीकी सहायकों और निर्देशक का अभिनंदन करें कि रामायण के संदेश के माध्यम से हमें हमारे धर्मपरायण कर्तव्यों का स्मरण कराया।

 

जय हिन्द।""

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today said that language preservation and development cannot be the task of government alone and added thatit has to take the form of people’s movement. ‘Community participation is essential for preserving and protecting languages’, he added.

He was addressing the gathering at the 28th Saraswati Samman presentation ceremony organized by the KK Birla Foundation in New Delhi today.

He lauded the KK Birla Foundation for creating a framework to adjudge the creative output in literature of different languages of our vast country to honour the most deserving. 

Stating that promotion of Indian languages was a cause that was close to his heart, the Vice President said that language is the lifeline of a culture. ‘We must make every effort to preserve, promote and propagate languages. When a language dies, there will be a loss of cultural identity, traditions and customs associated with that language’, he added. 

Observing that language preservation and development needs a multi-pronged approach, Shri Naidu advocated the need for people to speak in their mother tongue at all times except where it becomes necessary to communicate in another language. 

The Vice President opined that promotion of mother tongue should begin at the primary school level. He advised all state governments to make mother tongue mandatory during primary education.

He also emphasized that the respective local languages should be used extensively by state administrations across the country for improving efficiency and delivery of services. ‘The best way to preserve or promote any language is to use it extensively in everyday life’, the Vice President said. 

Speaking of the Parliament’s initiatives to promote regional languages, the Vice President said that Rajya Sabha members can now speak in any of the 22 scheduled languages in the Parliament and put forth their points of view. And added that simultaneous translation is provided and members can effectively communicate their thoughts in any of those languages.

Shri Naidu suggested the harnessing of the power of technology to preserve and promote our languages and culture. He called for the creation of more and more online dictionaries, encyclopedias, glossaries, research articles and searchable databases in all Indian languages.  ‘Old manuscripts should be electronically stored for easy retrieval’, he said. 

He urged more and more people should to write poetry, stories, novels and dramas in their native languages. ‘There is an urgent need to accord a sense of dignity and a sense of pride to those who speak, write and communicate in their native languages’, he said.

He also said that there is an urgent need to develop adequate material in dialects and folk literature of all our states and added that language learning is a catalyst for inclusive development as well. 

Opining that reading good poetry, literature and writings will not only kindle new thoughts but also provide us withhumour, happiness and soul-fulfilling emotions, the Vice President congratulated Dr. K. Siva Reddy who won the ‘Saraswati Samman’ for his Telugu poetry collection ‘Pakkaki Ottigilite’.

Shri Naidu said that Dr. K. Siva Reddy is one of the major poets of not only Telugu but also of Indian Literature and he has become a trend setter with his prolific writing and effortlessly experimenting with themes and forms.

The Vice President said that Dr. Siva Reddy had a whole range of poetic expression, echoing themes ranging from Marxism to Humanism and added that the poet has been a champion of the oppressed and suppressed people. 

Smt. Shobhana Bhartia, President, K.K. Birla Foundation, Shri Priyavrat Bhartia, President’s Nominee, K.K. Birla Foundation and others were present on the occasion.

The following is the full text of the speech: (Kindly see the attachment)

I am extremely happy to be present here at the 28th Saraswati Samman presentation ceremony organized by the KK Birla Foundation.

This event is very close to my heart as I have a special affection for the promotion of Indian languages. I admire the concept on which this Foundation has been founded by Late Dr. K.K. Birla, Former M.P. in 1991 with a great vision to promote Indian culture, literature, art, science and education.

I commend KK Birla Foundation for creating a framework to adjudge the creative output in literature of different languages of our vast country, and to honour the most deserving. It is a remarkable gesture that helps writers to creatively express themselves in Indian languages. 

I am glad to note that awards given by this Foundation are considered as some of the most prestigious in the field of Indian literature, and I would like to extend my deepest appreciation to the K.K. Birla Foundation for their endeavours. 

Dear sisters and brothers, 

Language is the lifeline of a culture. India is home to many languages and we must make every effort to preserve, promote and propagate them. When a language dies, there will be a loss of cultural identity, traditions and customs associated with that language.  

Language preservation and development needs a multi-pronged approach. I have been consistently advocating the need for the people to speak in their mother tongue at all times except where it becomes necessary to communicate in another language. I am not against learning English or any other language. But a person can communicate effectively and articulate better in his or her mother tongue.

However, language preservation and development cannot be the task of government alone. It has to take the form of people’s movement. Community participation is essential for preserving and protecting languages.

In my opinion, promotion of mother tongue should begin at the primary school level. I have been advising all state governments to make mother tongue mandatory up to primary school. I am also of the firm opinion that the respective local languages should be used extensively by state administrations across the country for improving efficiency and delivery of services. 

The best way to preserve or promote any language is to use it extensively in everyday life. More and more people should start using their native languages at home, in the community, in meetings and in administration.

As you all are aware, Rajya Sabha members can now speak in any of the 22 scheduled languages in the Parliament and put forth their points of view. Simultaneous translation is provided and members can effectively communicate their thoughts in any of those languages.

Thanks to technology, we are now able to facilitate simultaneous translation into different languages. We must harness the power of technology to preserve and promote our languages and culture. Online dictionaries, encyclopedias, glossaries, research articles and searchable databases should be prepared in all Indian languages.  Old manuscripts should be electronically stored for easy retrieval. 

I also feel that more and more people should be encouraged to write poetry, stories, novels and dramas in their native languages.

There is an urgent need to accord a sense of dignity and a sense of pride to those who speak, write and communicate in their native languages.

Here, I would like to appreciate and compliment organizations such as the K.K. Birla Foundation for their efforts to promote languages by recognizing and rewarding the merit and talent. 

More such efforts are needed by various stakeholders for preserving and promoting Indian languages. There is an urgent need to develop adequate material in dialects and folk literature of all our states. 

We should recognize that language learning is a catalyst for inclusive development as well. 

I am happy that the Foundation is calling this award “Saraswathi Samman”. What you are doing through these award functions is to honour writers who have the blessings of Goddess Saraswathi, the Goddess of learning, knowledge, music and education.  Preserving and propagating good ideas and knowledge through literature, fine arts and creation of other cultural artefacts is the true worship of Goddess Saraswathi. This “Saraswathi Samman” is also a tribute to the creative spark that, in our tradition, comes from the Goddess Saraswathi.  It is a spark that ignites imagination, fosters creativity and spreads the light of knowledge all around.   

Dear sisters and brothers,

Reading good poetry, literature and writings will not only kindle new thoughts but also provide us with humour, happiness and soul-fulfilling emotions. 

I have just had the honour of presenting Saraswati Samman to Dr. K. Siva Reddy for his Telugu poetry collection ‘Pakkaki Ottigilite’.

Dr. K. Siva Reddy is one of the major poets of not only Telugu but also of Indian Literature and he has become a trend setter with his prolific writing and effortlessly experimenting with themes and forms.

His literary career spanning more than four decades encapsulates all the movements and trends of the period, ranging from progressive, revolutionary, protest and humanistic movements which encompass Modernism as well as Post Modernism.

Having been immensely influenced by Marxism, he has been a champion of the oppressed and suppressed. He has great empathy for the labourers and the marginalized sections of the society. 

The book ‘Pakkaki Ottigilite’ is one of his recent poetry collections, which captures his ability to creatively deal with diverse themes.

Indeed, Dr. K. Siva Reddy is a prolific poet who never gets tired of writing. Dr. Reddy has been a recipient of the Central Sahitya Academy award, Gangadhar Mehar National Award and Kabir Samman Award.

Dr. Siva Reddy has a whole range of poetic expression echoing themes ranging from Marxism to Humanism. But, he firmly believes that the life is too complex for generalization and simplification. 

From the physical and social issues of the world to psychological struggles and quest for the truth of the individual in the recent poems, Dr. Siva Reddy captures different nuances very well.

I am deeply thankful to the K.K. Birla Foundation especially Smt. Shobhana Bhartiaji for having given me the opportunity to present this award. I congratulate Dr. K. Siva Reddy for his magnificent contribution to enriching the Telugu literature.

Thank you

Jai Hind !

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon the world leaders to isolate nations that promote and abet terror. Describing terror as an enemy of humanity, Shri Naidu said that it was time to join hands to eliminate the menace and reject those who perpetrate violence and create unrest. 

Addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Global Conference on 'Unity, Peace and Prosperity through Spirituality' organized by Brahma Kumaris, in Mount Abu, Rajasthan today, he said the choice was clear before everybody to choose between “the ones advocating peace, progress, prosperity and development and the ones preaching violence, hatred and bloodshed”

Stating that India has always upheld the ideal of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” by treating the whole world as one family, Shri Naidu said that it always wished for the peaceful coexistence with others and never acted as an aggressor. “We believe in the philosophy of 'Sarve Jana Sukhino Bhavantu', We want peaceful coexistence of everybody. Despite being known as Vishwaguru, India never attacked anybody”, he added. 

Saying that it was ironic that even in the era of technology, communities were being identified on the basis of religion and caste, Shri Naidu said that those who were spreading violence and terrorism in the name of religion were acting against its tenets.

Asserting that only spiritual knowledge could ensure true peace, unity, harmony, and stability in the world and well-being of all humanity, Sri Naidu said that spirituality was the basis of all religions and the same spiritual thread binds them together.

“Significance of religion is not in its geographical spread but in giving spiritual peace and stability to humanity. One must understand the inherent spiritual unity of all religions. We have only studied the history of religions, their geographical spread,  not their inherent spiritual unity,” he added.

Pointing out that Science and Technology has the ability to bring in a positive change in lives of people and humanity at large, the Vice President said that spiritual knowledge was needed to show the welfare path to science. He also cautioned against its misuse and called for effective utilization of technology to spread the Indian message of universal peace and welfare to the remote corners of the world.

Shri Naidu said that one must not forget India’s spiritual moorings, including our rich heritage of Yoga,  tolerance and peaceful coexistence while adapting to fast-paced changes in the world.

Opining that a New India was taking shape with the aspirations and energy of our youth and young entrepreneurs, the Vice President said opportunities must be provided to them to address challenges faced by the present-day world.

Shri Naidu also stressed the need to promote value-based education that ensures lasting peace, stability in the society and creates a just, equitable social order. He said: “If the conflicts emerge from the minds of the men than the differences of peace too should be built in the thoughts, ideologies, and attitudes of people through education and shaping of their value-systems.”

The Vice President called upon organizations such as Brahma Kumari’s and other voluntary organizations to take part in programs such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Swachh Bharat, Water Conservation, Poshan Abhiyan, Ending of Single-Use Plastic and stressed the need to bring about a change in people’s mindset and behaviour. 

The Governor of Rajasthan, Shri Kalraj Mishra, the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, the Minister of State for Forest & Environment, Government of Rajasthan, Shri Sukhram Bishnoi, the Chief of Brahma Kumaris, Rajayogi Janaki, Rajayogi BK Nirwair and Secretary-General of Brahma Kumaris and more than 8,000 volunteers of Brahma Kumaris were present at the event attended by dignitaries from several other countries.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""माननीय राज्यपाल श्री कलराज मिश्र जी, राजस्थान, माननीय श्री रमेश पोखरियाल ‘निशंक’, केन्द्रीय मानव संसाधन विकास मंत्री, मंचासीन परम आदरणीय दादी जानकी जी, मुख्य प्रशासिका ब्रह्माकुमारीज़ एवं देश-विदेश से पधारे हुए मीडिया बंधु तथा अन्य सभी सम्मानित अतिथिगण .. 

 

यह मेरा सौभाग्य है कि मुझे इस महान आध्यात्मिक संगठन के वैश्विक शिखर सम्मेलन के अवसर पर आप सबसे अपने विचार साझा करने का सुअवसर प्राप्त हुआ है। इसके लिए मैं हृदय से आभारी हूं। ‘आध्यात्मिकता द्वारा एकता, शांति एवं समृद्धि’ यह विषय आज के विश्व के लिए अपार संभावनाऐं संजोये है। इस विषय पर विश्व आपके विचार जानने को इच्छुक है। वर्तमान और भावी पीढ़ियां आध्यात्म और विकास के बीच संतुलन बनाने के लिए, आपसे मार्गदर्शन की अपेक्षा करती हैं।

 

मित्रों,

नयी आशाओं का नया भारत आकार ले रहा है। नये युवा उद्यमी-नयी चुनौतियों को नये अवसरों में बदलने की क्षमता रखते हैं। नयी तकनीक के साथ हमें अपने पुराने संस्कारों और आध्यात्मिक आधार को नहीं भूलना चाहिए। भारतीय संस्कृति में आध्यात्म की प्राचीन परंपरा रही है-गीता स्वयं ईश्वरीय उपदेश है, भगवान बुद्ध, भगवान महावीर की शिक्षाएं, हमारे षड्दर्शन से लेकर शंकराचार्य, कबीर, रैदास, नरसी मेहता, नानक, सूफी संत तथा आधुनिक काल में स्वामी विवेकानंद जैसे गुरुओं ने समाज का आध्यात्मिक मार्गदर्शन किया है। उसी महान परंपरा को आज आप जैसी संस्थाऐं और समृद्ध कर रही हैं। योग, आध्यात्मिक दर्शन, हमारे सामाजिक संस्कार-भारत की साफ्ट पावर हैं। आप जैसी संस्थाऐं विश्व को भारत की आध्यात्मिक शक्ति से परिचित करा रही हैं। 

 

New India is taking shape with the aspirations and energy  of our youth and young entrepreneurs. They have the capability to convert challenges into opportunities. As we adapt to fast changing technologies, we must not forget our spiritual moorings including our rich heritage of  Yoga, spriritualism, tolerance and peaceful coexistance. I am glad that Institutions like yours have taken this Indian message of universal peace and welfare to the remote corners of the world. 

 

अपने लंबे इतिहास में भारत शांतिपूर्ण सहअस्तित्व का समर्थक रहा है। हमारा विश्वास ‘वसुधैव कुटुंबकम्’ के आदर्श में रहा है। हमने कभी किसी देश पर आक्रमण नहीं किया। यह देश सम्राट अशोक का है जिसने जनकल्याण के लिए धम्म यात्राऐं कीं, देश-विदेश में शांति और धर्म प्रचारकों के माध्यम से ‘धम्म विजय’ की। हमारे शांति मंत्रों में “सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिन:, सर्वे संतु निरामया” की प्रार्थना की गई है। Share And Care अर्थात् ‘माधव सेवा से पहले मानव सेवा’ - यही हमारा संस्कार रहा है।

 

We have always upheld ideal of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”. This is the country of Emperor Ashoka who took out Dhamma Yatras for the welfare of his people. This is the land which believed that “ Yato Dharmah Toto Jayah”- Whoever follows the path of Dharma or rightous path becomes victorious . In our Shanti mantras we pray for welfare of all “ Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah, Sarve Santu Niramaya.”

 

मुझे यह जानकर हर्ष है कि हमारे माननीय प्रधानमंत्री श्री नरेन्द्र मोदी ने इस संस्था की 103 वर्षीय मुख्य प्रशासिका दादी जानकी जी को स्वच्छ भारत अभियान का ब्राण्ड एम्बेसेडर बनाया है। मैं अपेक्षा करुंगा कि आपकी संस्था सरकार द्वारा प्रारंभ किये गये स्वच्छ भारत, बेटी बचाओ बेटी पढ़ाओ, जल संरक्षण, पोषण अभियान, Single use Plastic से मुक्ति जैसे रचनात्मक कार्यक्रमों में सहयोग करे। आपके सहयोग से ये कार्यक्रम जन अभियान बन सकेंगे जिसमें जनसाधारण स्वत: ही सक्रिय सहयोग करेंगे। सरकार और आपके साझा प्रयास से ही नयी सकारात्मक जन संस्कृति का प्रचार-प्रसार होगा। मैं आपके सहयोग का आग्रह करता हूं।

 

I am sure that with your support to many governmental initiatives like Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Swachh Bharat,  Water Conservation, Poshan Abhiyan, Removal of  Single Use Plastic, there will be greater sociual action and a significant social change in people’s mindset and behaviour.  

 

मित्रों,

आज सारा विश्व अपने ज्ञान कौशल, वैज्ञानिक तकनीक, प्रबंधन के बल पर भौतिक सभ्यता की ओर निरन्तर अग्रसर हो रहा है। अखिल विश्व संचार तकनीक के बल पर एक ग्लोबल विलेज बन रहा है। विभिन्न संस्कृति, धर्म, सभ्यताओं के बीच संवाद संभव हुआ है। एक दूसरे से संवाद करने के बेहतर अवसर और विकल्प उपलब्ध हो रहे हैं। 

 

परंतु इन उपलब्धियों के बाद भी, क्या मानव सभ्यता सही दिशा में बढ़ रही है? जिस आदर्श वैश्विक गांव का सपना हम देखते हैं वहां शांति, आध्यात्मिक, आत्मिक एकता होनी आवश्यक है। सूचना क्रांति हमें संपर्क के माध्यम तो उपलब्ध करा सकती है, पर सभ्यता साझे अनुभव, मूल्यों, आदर्शों और उद्देश्यों से बनती है, सिर्फ तकनीक से नहीं।

 

What we envisage as  “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,” the Global Village, is a global  community where not withstanding diversity of cultures, languages and beliefs, the inherent spiritual unity and harmony prevails. Information technology can only facilitate contact and communication, but a civilization is built on the basis of shared experiences, values, ideals and aspirations and by preserving the best in our cultural heritage. 

 

जब धर्म के नाम पर हिंसा और आतंक का तांडव-नृत्य होने लगता है तो हमारे मन में मनुष्य के ज्ञान और विवेक को लेकर संदेह होने लगता है। जब मनुष्य में स्वार्थ, अहंकार, भेदभाव इत्यादि संकीर्ण भावनायें उसके विवेक पर नियंत्रण कर लेती हैं तो एक दूसरे के प्रति सम्मान, सद्भावना, प्रेम, सहयोग, सहअस्तित्व जैसे मानवीय मूल्यों का अवसान होने लगता है। इससे मनुष्य के व्यक्तिगत जीवन, समाज तथा वैश्विक सभ्यता में विसंगतियां उत्पन्न हो रही हैं। इस स्थिति से उबारने के लिए आपका योगदान जरुरी है।

 

हम सभी के लिए यह गौरव का विषय है कि प्रजापिता ब्रह्माकुमारी ईश्वरीय विश्वविद्यालय, भारत सहित पूरे विश्व में लगभग 140 देशों में 8500 सेवाकेन्द्रों के माध्यम से अखिल मानवता को प्राचीन भारतीय सांस्कृतिक और आध्यात्मिक मूल्यों की शिक्षा प्रदान कर रहा है। 

 

मानवता को सांइस और टेक्नालाजी के साथ आध्यात्मिक ज्ञान की भी आवश्यकता है जो विज्ञान को कल्याणकारी राह दिखा सके। आज जब विश्व में धार्मिक, जातीय विद्वेष और आतंकवाद का विष फैल रहा है तब आशंका है कि विज्ञान की प्रगति का दुरुपयोग आतंकवादी गिरोह न करें। यह विडंबना है कि संपर्क क्रांति के इस युग में भी, आज समुदायों की पहचान धर्म और जाति के आधार पर हो रही है। 

धर्म की स्थापना तो जनकल्याण के लिए हुई थी न कि समाज में विघटन और हिंसा के लिए। जो धर्म के नाम पर हिंसा, आतंकवाद फैला रहे हैं वे वस्तुत: धर्म के विरोधी हैं। हमको धर्म के आध्यात्मिक आधार को समझना होगा। आध्यात्मिकता ही धर्म का मूल उद्देश्य है। हर धर्म का आध्यात्मिक आधार लगभग एक ही है। हमने धर्मों के इतिहास, उनके भौगोलिक प्रसार का अध्ययन ही किया है-उनकी निहित आध्यात्मिक एकता, उनकी दार्शनिक गहराई का नहीं। धर्म की सार्थकता उसके भौगोलिक प्रसार में नहीं बल्कि मानवता को आध्यात्मिक शांति और स्थिरता देने में है।

 

Spirituality is the basis of all the religions.  There is an inherent unity among all the religions. The same spiritual thread binds them together. We must collectively recognize this truth and propagate it. That is what your organization is actively doing and I am happy that you have been doing it over many decades. 

 

मित्रों,

सिर्फ मानव को ही यह विवेक प्राप्त है कि वह स्वयं अपने अस्तित्व, उसके उद्देश्य का विश्लेषण कर सके, जो स्वयं अपने से प्रश्न कर सके और उसके उत्तर ढूढ़ने का प्रयास करे। यह प्रयास ही हमें आध्यात्मिक गहराई प्रदान करता है। हमारे द्वारा ‘स्वयं’ को खोजना ही आध्यात्म है। उपनिषदों में पंच महावाक्यों का उल्लेख है अहं ब्रह्मास्मि (मैं ब्रह्म हूं); तत् तत्वमसि (वह ब्रह्म तुम हो); अयं आत्मा ब्रह्म (यह आत्मा ब्रह्म है); प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म (ज्ञान ब्रह्म है); सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म (सर्वत्र ब्रह्म है)-ये सभी हमारी मूलभूत आत्मिक एकता की ओर संकेत करते हैं। आध्यात्मिक उत्कर्ष, दूसरे मतों, विश्वासों को नीचा दिखा कर नहीं बल्कि स्वयं अपने अहंकार को पराजित करके प्राप्त होता है। किसी आध्यात्मिक आदर्श के बिना, हमारी वैज्ञानिक और तकनीक प्रगति भी मानव समाज को सुरक्षा, स्थायित्व प्रदान नहीं कर सकती। अत: जरुरी है कि हम अपनी तकनीकी प्रगति तथा आध्यात्मिक चिंतन को पूरक बनायें। आध्यात्मिक आधार के बिना मात्र भौतिक समृद्धि से संस्कारों और जीवन मूल्यों में विसंगतियां आयेंगी- व्यक्तिगत जीवन और समाज में असंतुलन बढ़ेगा। जीवन का सरल, स्वस्थ और संतुलित बनाने के लिए आध्यात्मिक आधार आवश्यक है।

 

मित्रों, 

यह माना गया है कि कोई संघर्ष सबसे पहले मानव मस्तिष्क में जन्म लेते हैं अत: संघर्ष के विरूद्ध सुरक्षा भी मानव मस्तिष्क, उसके संस्कारों, उसकी शिक्षा में ही तैयार करनी होगी। आध्यात्मिक ज्ञान ही विश्व में सच्ची शांति, एकता, समरसता और स्थायित्व सुनिश्चित कर सकता है और संपूर्ण मानवता का कल्याण हो सकता है।

 

If the conflicts emerge from the minds of the men than the defences of peace too should be built in the thoughts, ideologies and attitudes of people through education and shaping of their value-systems. Value based education can ensure lasting peace, stability in the society and create a just, equitable social order.

 

मुझे हर्ष है कि आपकी संस्था ने विश्व शांति के लिए संयुक्त राष्ट्र के Culture of Peace सहित वैश्विक स्तर पर अनेक अभियानों में अपना महत्वपूर्ण सहयोग दिया है। जिसके लिए हमारे श्रद्वेय प्रधानमंत्री स्व. श्री अटल जी द्वारा वर्ष 2002 में संस्था की तत्कालीन मुख्य प्रशासिका दादी प्रकाशमणि जी को सम्मानित किया था। संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ द्वारा आपकी आध्यात्मिक संस्था को 7 अंतरराष्ट्रीय शांतिदूत पुरस्कारों से सम्मानित किया जा चुका है। 

 

अंत में, इस महासम्मेलन में भारत, नेपाल तथा विश्व के अनेक देशों से पधारे हुए सभी महानुभावों का आभार व्यक्त करते हुए आशा करता हूं कि आप इस महासम्मेलन से शांति, एकता और समृद्धि के लिए एक आध्यात्मिक संदेश लेकर जायेंगे तथा देश और समाज को सशक्त बनाने में अपना योगदान अवश्य देंगे।

 

जय हिन्द।

                Expressing serious concern over inordinate delay in justice delivery in the country, Vice President of India and Chairman of Rajya Sabha Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has suggested several reforms including bifurcation of the Supreme Court  and setting up of four Regional Benches of the Apex Court besides evolving Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that limit the number of adjournments and the timeframe for disposal of cases by the courts. 

            Shri Naidu spoke at length on the present state of judicial system in the country and the pressing need for  reforms  in the presence of Supreme Court Judge Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, Attorney General of India Shri K.K. Venugopal, several former judges including Justice A.R. Dave and senior advocates like Shri Salman Khurshid, Shri Rajiv Dhawan, Smt. Mahalakshmi Pavani after releasing of book ‘Parameswara to PP’, a compilation of articles of former senior advocate of the Supreme Court late Shri Pavani Parameswara  Rao (P.P. Rao). 

            Shri Venkaiah Naidu strong endorsed the recommendation of the Law Commission towards splitting the Supreme Court into Constitutional Division and Courts of Appeal for steady disposal of cases. 

            Shri Naidu also underlined the need to set up four Regional Benches of the apex court and went to the extent of saying that this arrangement does not require any amendment to the Constitution. He recalled that Article 130 of the Constitution which says: “The Supreme Court shall sit in Delhi or in such other place or places, as the Chief Justice of India may, with the approval of the President, from time to time appoint.”  Shri Naidu also referred to a recommendation of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice on having Regional Benches of the Supreme Court on trial basis. 

            To cut the present delays in delivering justice, Shri Naidu urged that Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) may be evolved by the judiciary  by which the number of permissible adjournments can be specified and a time  limit can be set for disposal of cases based on the nature of issues involved. 

            The Vice President urged the Government to be much more proactive in addressing the large number of pending vacancies  in the judicial system so that delays are avoided. He urged the judiciary and the Government to act in tandem in this regard. 

            Continuing with his concern over justice delivery, Shri Naidu said; “the speed and quality of justice delivery in the country has a huge bearing on the economic development as it impacts the flow of investment. It would be better if judges at various levels are exposed to special orientation programmes organised by the judiciary itself on various technical and specialised branches of emerging laws and the attendant issues and processes. ”

            Shri Naidu has called for induction of capable judges and quality lawyers besides improving the quality of legal education to enable delivery of justice in time. 

            Shri Naidu who is also the Presiding Officer of Rajya Sabha underscored the need to revisit the Anti-Defection Laws contained in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution to prevent loopholes and set time limits for the Presiding Officers of various legislatures to decide on defection matters in quick time. He recalled several  instances  of delay in deciding on defection  matters as a result of which those subsequently disqualified have completed their terms in legislatures. He also suggested special judicial tribunals for disposing defection cases within six months to one year. 

            The Vice President also underscored the need for election cases and cases of criminal proceedings against politicians to be decided by special benches of higher courts for their disposal within six months. 

            Shri Naidu expressed concern over the huge pendency of over 3 crore cases in different courts across the country with some of them pending over for 50 years. 

            Shri Naidu hailed former senior Supreme Court advocate Late Shri P.P. Rao as an epitome of “sobriety, balance and equanimity” who never resorted to any histrionics in the court even in extreme situations. He recalled Late Shri P.P. Rao being instrumental in pioneering the instrument of ‘Curative Petition’ by successfully arguing for the right of appeal which was earlier rejected by a seven judge bench of the Supreme Court. “The Principle of Propriety which guided Late Shri P.P. Rao all through his forty year long legal profession and the values of the old world he upheld are worthy of emulation by the present generation ”  Shri Naidu said. 

The following is the full text of the speech:

Distinguished invitees and friends from media!

            For me, the release of this book ‘Parameswara to PP’ marks celebration of two sets of values, one of which relates to values held dear all through his professional career  by  a person and the other being the family values which are the most cherished in our society. 

            Parliament and Judiciary are among the three pillars of our parliamentary democracy. In respect of Parliament, it is said that Members  rush into the Well of the House when they short on facts.  About the Courts, it is said that lawyers raise their voice when they are short on law. 

            Late Shri Pavani Parameswara Rao, widely known as ‘PP’   was bound by a set of values that are usually associated with the ‘Old Word‘ all through his 40 year long career and still emerged as among the best  legal minds of our country. He started his career as a Law teacher earning about Rs. 400 per month and made his way up to earn the same for less than fraction of a second of his time as an impactful lawyer. 

            PP was neither flashy nor flamboyant. He did not resort to histrionics in the court when the Bench was not considerate to his point of view. He never raised his voice and was never discourteous to the court. In the words of Shri Abhishek  Manu Singhvi, the defining characteristics of PP were ‘sobriety, balance and equanimity’. PP always shunned vulgarity of speech or conduct and he never trivialised the issues at hand. His advocacy was marked by inherent balance, restraint and genetic gentlemanliness which were manifestation of either inherent inner calm and stability or cultivated by some special form of  meditation. PP always considered the client as ‘annadata’. PP himself wrote in one of his articles in the Book released today that ‘Advocacy is a profession, not business’.  

            Smt. Mahalakshmi Pavani, PP’s daughter-in-law and the spirit behind the book  revealed that she never got the open support and handholding expected of her influential father-in-law. PP’s mantra to his kith and kin was ‘deserve what you desire and there is no substitute for hard work’. When the delighted Mahalakshmi informed PP that she was designated as senior advocate, PP retorted saying ‘since when it has become so easy’. PP had even supported Mahalakshmi’s opponent for the post of vice president of the Supreme Court Bar Association saying that such an office should be held by a more experienced lawyer. 

            In my view, Parameswara became PP by virtue of his unflinching faith in the principle of ‘Power of Propriety’ and he guided by this principle in the pursuit of truth as defined by the laws of the land. Hence, the release of this Book marks the celebration such lofty values and ideals upheld by PP. 

            Smt. Mahalakshmi seems to have had a grudge against her father-in-law  for not backing her in the profession to the extent expected. However, this made her what she is today on her own as a senior advocate in the Supreme Court and she can be rightly proud of her accomplishments. This is what perhaps PP desired and  Mahalakshmi conformed to his principle of ‘deserve and desire’.  

            Despite not getting the open praise or support from her father-in-law, Smt. Mahalakshmi Pavani, out of her respect for the life and legacy of PP took upon herself the responsibility of brining out this Book ‘Parameswara to PP’ containing 48 illuminating articles written by PP besides revealing tributes to him by several legal luminaries.  This book in my view will serve as a useful guide to the practitioners of law and students of law on a range of issues including how to prepare a brief, present a case with proper framing of issues, argue the case with clarity of analysis, conduct oneself in the court and with the fellow professionals. This task undertaken by Smt. Mahalakshmi for the benefit of the posterity, in my view is spurred by the family values of gratitude to the head of the family who instilled the core values and principles of life in his family members.  Hence, release of this book is also a celebration of such values.  

            My common thread with PP being that he was also graduated from my hometown Nellore. Being in Delhi for long years, I have had some idea about PP’s rise to the top but I got a better peek into his mind and life when I read some of  his articles contained in this Book. 

            PP had been associated with quite a few landmark judgements of the apex court that set precedents. I came to know from this book that PP was instrumental in the coming into being  of the instrument of ‘curative petition’ after his forceful and successful articulation of the right to appeal in the A.R. Antulay case. Curative Petition is filed when a Review Petition for correcting a wrong committed by the Court is rejected. He also propounded the  doctrine of ‘Common Thread’ in SR Bommai case besides articulating that secularism is built into the basic structure of our Constitution. The concerned Benches   of the Supreme Court on several occasions went on record appreciating the analysis and presentation of PP in broadening the perspective of interpreting the Constitution and the laws even when he did not win those  cases. 

            It is heartening to know that PP was associated  with several landmark cases like the ADM  Jabalpur Vs. Shivkant Shukla Case, Keshawanand Bharati Case, MS Gill Vs. Election Commission Case, SR Bommai Case, JMM Bribery Case, PUCL Case on Voters right to information about antecedents of contesting candidates, Ayodhya case, Best Bakery Case, Entry Tax Case, 2G Spectrum Case etc.  

            Though PP assisted the then Attorney General Niren De in the ADM Jabalpur Case, he seems to have had some reservations about the extent of amending the Constitution impinging on the fundamental rights of the citizens. Though PP was successful in JMM MPs getting acquitted in the bribery case by strongly arguing for the immunity of the MPs against criminal proceedings, he had a change of heart on seeing the decline in the standard of politics. In one of his articles he wrote and I quote ‘In the prevailing conditions of public morality, I do not think such a privilege is justified’. 

            Known for his mild manners and sobriety, PP in his article on ‘Perils of Fearless Democracy’ wrote that “Rules of professional conduct and etiquette require that an Advocate shall present his case fearlessly with due respect to the court”. He, however, recalled as to how he was at the receiving end of a Judge for openly questioning the Judge’s line of interpretation of law. 

            After his success in the 2G Spectrum Case, PP had a word of advice for the Court. He wrote that ‘I am of the view that in cases involving far reaching economic consequences affecting the Nation, it would be better for the Court to take the assistance of financial experts in moulding relief appropriately.’

            After successfully opposing T.N. Seshan’s bid  against multi-member Central Election Commission, PP still has a word of praise for Seshan for making CEC an effective institution and said that Seshan would have been better off without his abrasive ways. 

            PP in one of the articles in this book opposed the judgement of Justice late Chinnappa Reddy in reducing death sentence of two naxalites  who shot dead a forest contractor to life terms. Justice Reddy in his judgement wrote and I quote ‘People acting out of genuine and passionate motive according to their conscience, do not merit extreme punishment’.  PP had an issue with this kind of reasoning. 

            In the context of the apex court hearing arguments in the Ayodhya Case, it is pertinent to recall what PP had written in one of the articles in this Book on the Presidential reference to the Supreme Court under Article 143(1) of the Constitution for its opinion on the question ‘Whether Hindu temple or any Hindu religious structure existed prior to the construction of the Ram Janm Bhumi – Babri Masjid’. PP wrote and I quote; “All the five Judges unanimously declined to answer the reference made by the President. Had the Constitution Bench answered the Presidential Reference, the dispute which has become a source of frequent communal tensions could have been resolved once and for all. In my turn, I pleaded before the Court and answer it in larger public interest. ”

            PP had an independent mind and was not a regime lawyer.  He was guided by the principles he believed in and functioned within the boundaries of law and the principles of decorum in the courts.  He was a true representative of the ‘Charm of the old world’ and is worthy of emulation by the present generations. 

            Dear Sisters and Brothers,

                        After recalling the life and contributions of an eminent legal luminary like PP in the presence of some leading legal minds and others, it would be in order to briefly look at the present state of judiciary in our country. 

Over the years, a number of reforms have made our judicial system more robust and responsive. But we have a long way to go. The most urgent judicial reform necessary is the elimination of judicial delays and the improvement of the efficiency of the justice system.

The government needs to be much more proactive in addressing the large number of pending vacancies in the judicial system so that delays are avoided.

It is widely known that we have several eminent lawyers and erudite judges in the courts. Still, the justice delivery process is crying for reform to further enhance the faith of the common man in our judiciary by ensuring justice in time and at affordable costs. The huge pendency of courts at various levels totalling over 3 crores is a matter of deep concern. Recently, the Chief Justice of India Justice Ranjan Gogoi stated that over one thousand cases are pending for 50 years and over 2 lakh cases are languishing for 25 years. Out of about 90 lakh pending civil cases, more than 20 lakh are at a stage where summons have not been served at. 

            Collectively, judiciary needs to address the issue of delay in the delivery of justice.  Adequate infrastructure in the form of the required number of judges at various levels and the attendant physical infrastructure need to be ensured. There is also a felt need for ensuring capable judges and quality advocates. Immediate attention needs to be paid to the quality of legal education in the country.  Ethical standards of profession should be imbibed by the students of law and the practicing lawyers. 

            The speed and quality of justice delivery in the country has a huge bearing on the economic development as it impacts the flow of investments.   It would be better if Judges at various levels are exposed to special orientation programmes organised by the judiciary itself on various technical and specialised branches of emerging laws and the attendant issues and processes. 

As regards election cases pending before various courts, they need to be disposed of expeditiously.

Election petitions and criminal cases against political leaders must be decided quickly by special benches of higher courts in a time-bound manner. If need be, separate benches may be setup to expedite such cases within six months or one year.

There are other Judicial and Legislative reforms, I would like to suggest.

I would like to reiterate that in the cases involving disqualification of member of legislature who change parties, the chairperson of the legislative bodies must expeditiously take a decision. Here also, the anti-defection law is not implemented in letter and spirit and because of the inaction of the Speaker or Chairman, the legislators continue in the new party and, in a few cases, even become ministers in the government. This kind of travesty of justice should not be tolerated. 

Any delays in these cases erode public confidence in the judicial and legislative bodies. 

I would suggest that we should have special judicial tribunals which will decide the cases within a reasonable time of, let us say six months or at the most one year. I would also suggest we revisit the 10th Schedule of our Constitution, containing anti-defection provisions, to ensure a time bound disposal of such cases and make it more effective by plugging loopholes. 

It is time to consider to evolve Standard Operation Procedures that specify the number of adjournments permissible and the outer limit for disposing of cases  based on the nature of cases. Judges and advocates need to imbibe time discipline and adhere to SOPs to ensure speedy justice. 

Dear Sisters & brothers

Government has enhanced the number of judges in the Supreme Court by 10% but I am afraid it may be still inadequate.

Expanding the Supreme Court bench and having separate benches in different regions on trial basis has been suggested by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice.

As the Law Commission has suggested, there is a need for division of the Supreme Court into a Constitution Bench at Delhi and Cassation benches in four regions—Delhi, Chennai/Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai.

I tend to agree with this recommendation. I think it is high time we had more benches because in a country as vast as India the litigants have to travel long distances and spend a huge amount of money and energy.

A number of civil and criminal cases have been pending for over 25 years. This makes me think that we need to not only expand the Supreme Court but also divide the work into Constitutional Division and a number of legal divisions or Courts of Appeal. 

As the Law Commission has suggested, I would like the Supreme Court to have two divisions’ one dealing with Constitutional matters and another with appeals. This suggestion merits serious consideration and decision by the Supreme Court as well as the government because it would enable the Supreme Court to devote more time to Constitutional issues and make it more accessible to common people. 

As regards the need for division of the Apex Court in four regions, Article 130 of the constitution states: “The Supreme Court shall sit in Delhi or in such other place or places, as the Chief Justice of India may, with the approval of the President, from time to time, appoint”.

At the end I would like to quote David Pannick a Member of Parliament in UK and a legal luminary “Judges are mere mortals but they are asked to perform a function that is truly divine.” Yes, ensuring delivery of justice in time is a divine task and the judges and advocates should rise to the task to uphold the divinity associated in delivering justice to the deserving. 

Shri P P Rao is one of those rare legal luminaries who spent a lifetime to the delivery of Justice.

             I am happy to be associated with the release of this Book which holds mirror to the mind and life of PP and his distinguished contributions over four decades to the cause of upholding law and enriching the attendant processes.

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today urged all stake holders of the tourism industry to be especially mindful of their ecological foot print and called for more responsible and sustainable tourism practices.

Expressing his concern over the problem of pollution, he asked service providers to make sustainability and conservation an integral part of their business plans. Adopt a more judicious approach to consumption of resources so that future generations also have the opportunity to avail of all the benefits of tourism, he said.

Inaugurating the World Tourism Day-2019 celebrations in New Delhi today, Shri Naidu expressed his happiness at India being selected as the host country for celebration of World Tourism Day 2019 by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).

Shri Naidu stressed that there is a need to keep in mind the aspect of ‘ethics’ in travel and added that tourism should benefit people and the environment in different destinations. ‘It should offer better income to families living in the area, by sourcing products and services locally. It should serve as a tool for the empowerment of local communities’, he opined.

The Vice President met with Ms. Sofia Montiel De Afara, Minister of Tourism of Paraguay on the sidelines of the event and held discussions about India-Paraguay co-operation in the field of tourism. Shri Naidu advised the Minister of Tourism to also look into easing of visa regulations to facilitate travel of citizens for tourism, business, trade and commerce and called for promoting people-to-people contacts between the two countries.

The Vice President also met with the Mr. Zurab Pololikashvili, Secretary-General of UNWTO. 

The Vice President said that World Tourism Day was celebrated every year to create awareness on the social, cultural and economic values of tourism and to encourage global communities to travel, experience and learn to respect the diverse cultures of the world.

Observing that tourism is a major engine of economic growth and an important source of employment and foreign exchange earnings in many countries, Shri Naidu said that tourism in India has tremendous potential, considering the country’s rich cultural and historical heritage, varied ecology, terrains and places of natural beauty spread across the country.

The Vice President expressed his happiness at the fact that, in both developed and less developed economies, Travel & Tourism employed a far higher proportion of women than other sectors. He urged more women to explore career opportunities in the tourism sector.

Noting that India had been placed at 34th position out of 140 economies, in the World Economic Forum’s ‘World Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Rank’ in 2019, the Vice President said that it remained the sub-region's most competitive Travel and Tourism economy.

Outlining the steps taken by the government to make the country accessible and safe to travelers, Shri Naidu applauded the liberalized visa regime and said that it would certainly stimulate business and investment, along with tourism.

Observing that Budget 2019 envisioned the development of 17 iconic tourist sites as world class tourist centres to improve the flow of domestic and foreign tourists, the Vice President called for augmenting and upgrading tourism infrastructure and urged the corporate sector to supplement the efforts of the governments in this regard.

The Vice President asked people, especially the youth to visit at least 15 tourist destinations within India by 2022 to give boost to domestic tourism, as per the suggestion made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Shri Naidu urged students to undertake ‘Bharat Darshan’ to learn about various facets of India’s culture, heritage, languages and cuisine and enhance their understanding of the unique cultural mosaic of the country. ‘This understanding would help them devise ingenuous and effective solutions to the challenges faced by the country today’, he said.

He advised tourism service providers to continuously strive for service excellence, and to make conservation and sustainability an integral part of their business model.

The Vice President also underscored India’s tremendous potential in the field of medical tourism and said that India must leverage its ancient practices of healing such as Ayurveda and Yoga to attract more tourists who seek holistic wellness.

Shri Prahlad Singh Patel, Hon’ble Minister of State (I/C) for Tourism and Culture, Mr. Zurab Pololikashvii, Secretary General, United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), Ms. Sofia Montiel De Afara, Minister of Tourism of Paraguay, Shri Yogendra Tripathi, Secretary, Ministry of Tourism and others were present on the occasion.

The following is the full text of the speech: 

I am delighted to be here with the delegates from the global tourism industry on the occasion of World Tourism Day 2019.I am happy that the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has selected India as the host country for celebration of World Tourism Day 2019.

World Tourism Day is celebrated every year with the objective of generating widespread awareness about the social, cultural and economic values of tourism and at the same time to encourage global communities to travel, experience and learn to respect the diverse cultures of the world.

This ultimately paves the way for economic development through Travel and Tourism.

I am happy to know that the theme for World Tourism Day 2019 is ‘Tourism and Jobs: A better future for all’.

Tourism is a major engine of economic growth and an important source of employment and foreign exchange earnings in many countries, including India.

In this context, this theme is most appropriate as it acknowledges the capacity of tourism to create large-scale employment opportunities and the important role it plays in achieving growth with equity and sustainability.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Tourism in India has tremendous potential, considering the country’s rich cultural and historical heritage, varied ecology, terrains and places of natural beauty spread across the country.

From the frigid deserts of Leh, to the sun-drenched sand dunes of Rajasthan, to the lush forests of Madhya Pradesh, to the expansive backwaters of Kerala, to the pristine waters of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the natural beauty of the Indian subcontinent is unparalleled.

Today, India is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world.

Home to 30 cultural and 7 natural World Heritage Sites, India has a mesmeric conflation of the old and the new.

As all of you are aware, ours is a 5000-year-old civilization. As such, tourism in India has a very old history. The essences of Vedic, Islamic and western cultures are all blended in Indian civilization.

Its travel tradition starts with Pre-Vedic- Indus valley civilization which witnessed visits of people of different centres of human settlements for the purposes of social integration, trade and learning.

Development of traditional industries, trading routes and flourishing trade created another stream of travellers in India.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, the great Indian philosopher also known as the Architect of Pilgrimage Tourism in India, Shankaracharya, encouraged domestic pilgrimage.

This trend of travel within the country continues to this day. Indeed, domestic tourism has become an important contributor to the tourism sector in India.

There has been a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.11% in domestic tourist visits to all States/UTs from 1991 to 2018.

My dear sisters and brothers,

It is heartening to know that a total of 1.4 billion tourists travelled across the world generating US$1.7 trillion in worldwide exports in 2018, marking a sustained growth in international tourism for the ninth consecutive year.

Tourism provides 10 percent of Income across the globe and creates myriad employment opportunities. Tourism goes where other sectors often don’t. Take a tiny island nation like the Maldives or a landlocked Himalayan kingdom like Bhutan, tourism generates revenue and provides jobs.

In both developed and less developed economies, Travel & Tourism also typically employ a far higher proportion of women than other sectors. Not only are more women employed in tourism, they have more opportunity for advancement

The growth of global tourism can be attributed to several factors including the removal of barriers to global mobility, increased accessibility as well as the desire in large numbers of people to travel and experience the diverse cultures and lifestyles of countries across the globe.

Tourism in India has also been experiencing a strong period of growth--driven by the burgeoning Indian middle class, growth in high spending foreign tourists, and coordinated government campaigns to promote ‘Incredible India’ as a multi-faceted tourism destination. The Indian tourism industry has in fact, emerged as one of the key drivers of growth among the services sectors in India.

India is now the 7th largest tourism economy in the world and is among the top 3 destinations in the world for medical tourism. In 2018, 27.39 million tourists visited India and over 6 lakh medical tourists visit India every year.

India has been placed at 34h position out of 140 economies, in the World Economic Forum’s ‘World Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Rank’ in 2019. It accounts for the majority of South Asia's Travel and Tourism GDP, and remains the sub-region's most competitive Travel and Tourism economy.

The government has also taken several decisive steps to make the country accessible and safe to travellers. The Visa regime has been greatly liberalized to stimulate business and investment, along with tourism.

We now extend e-visa facility to tourists from more than 180 countries.

India has also greatly improved its business environment, the ease of doing business, overall Travel and Tourism policy and enabling conditions, infrastructure and Information and Communications Technology.

We are also focusing on the augmentation and up gradation of tourism infrastructure. Budget 2019 envisions the development of 17 iconic tourist sites as world class tourist centres to improve the flow of domestic and foreign tourists.

While the central and state governments are doing their bit to develop tourist spots and promote tourism, I would like to suggest to the corporate sector to supplement the efforts of the governments.

I compliment the government for introducing schemes such as Swadesh Darshan, National Mission for Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD) and also the Railway Ministry for launching special pilgrimage packages.

The recent decision to reduce GST on hospitality sector is also a positive step to encourage tourism.

I feel that as suggested by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, people, especially the youth must visit at least 15 tourist destinations within India by 2022 to give boost to domestic tourism.

Youngsters, especially students of our country must undertake ‘Bharat Darshan’ to learn about various facets of India’s culture, heritage, languages and cuisine and enhance their understanding of the unique cultural mosaic of the country. This understanding would help them devise ingenuous and effective solutions to the challenges faced by the country today.

India is also emerging as a large source market for travel and tourism, with countries taking various steps to attract the Indian tourists. This two-way movement of tourists to and from the country is bound to be of mutual benefit to all.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Tourism is a key enabler of people to people contact.

Tourism helps in winning hearts and minds.

Tourism teaches us many lessons. It helps us imbibe the qualities of patience and tolerance. When we see new places, our knowledge of the world and understanding will be enhanced.

I am glad to know that as a United Nations Agency, the World Tourism Organization is spearheading the promotion of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism globally.

The role of UNWTO in promoting tourism as a driver of economic growth, inclusive development and environmental sustainability and offering leadership and support to the tourism sector in advancing knowledge and tourism policies worldwide is commendable.

We should look at tourism as a way of transforming not just the economy, but the lives of people within and outside the sector.

Transformation for us is not only about growth in tourist arrivals, growth of GDP, growth of investment and trade, and growth of jobs within the existing industry framework. The idea of transformation goes much beyond.

It is about creating opportunities, through tourism, for each and every individual to play a direct role and partake in the benefits that are accrued through tourism.

Such transformation should enable the local communities to actively and meaningfully playing a leadership role in industry development, and influence the direction of growth. 

Even as we prepare for larger numbers of tourists, stronger demands and higher sales turnover, we should remain mindful of the challenges ahead.

There is a need to keep in mind the aspect of ‘ethics’ in travel.

Tourism should benefit people and the environment in different destinations.

It should offer better income to families living in the area, by sourcing products and services locally. It should serve as a tool for the empowerment of local communities.

I congratulate the UNWTO for adopting the First Ever Convention on Tourism Ethics this month during its 23rd General Assembly, thereby bringing UNWTO in line with the wider United Nations system.

For the Indian Tourism Industry, my advice is to continuously strive for service excellence, an important measure of productivity in the Tourism industry.

We must also place great emphasis on conservation and sustainability as we promote tourism.

Large numbers of tourists also result in enormous volumes of water and energy usage, as well as waste creation and pollution.

The service providers as well as the tourists must be mindful of their ecological foot print and must adopt a much more judicious approach to consumption of resources so that future generations also have the opportunity to avail of all the benefits of tourism

For that, we must have a long term vision and a robust road map for the development of our tourism sector in an eco-friendly manner so that it is sustainable in the long run.

The government’s move to ban single-use plastics can go a long way in curbing pollution and is a right step in this direction.

We must also make full use of our tremendous medical tourism potential. India is home to unique, ancient systems of healing and wellness such as Ayurveda. We must leverage this ancient wisdom to attract more tourists who seek holistic wellness.

I am happy to see a partnership between the Government and the tourism sector that is focusing on improving skills, increasing the quality and quantity of jobs available and boosting entrepreneurship in the industry.

The government is committed to promoting culture and tourism to enable Indians to derive the maximum benefits from Tourism.

I commend the commitment and passion of the tourism industry stakeholders.

The ideal of ‘Athithi devo bhava’ has been at the core of our civilization since time immemorial. Let us keep up our commitment to this lofty ideal and open our nation to the world and welcome travellers from all over the globe to incredible India!

I would like to extend my heartiest congratulations to all the award winners and wish all of you a rewarding journey ahead as you take the tourism industry to greater heights through your outstanding service and excellence.

Thank you!

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has urged youth to participate in a big way to eradicate social evils, poverty, and illiteracy. He also asked them to be in the forefront in eliminating casteism and religious fundamentalism.

Delivering the first Prof. Yashwantrao Kelkar Memorial Lecture, in Mumbai today, he pointed out that the country was facing challenges on different fronts - about 20 percent of the population was still living in poverty and an equal percentage of people were illiterate.

Shri Naidu cited instances of social, gender discrimination and atrocities against women, corruption, casteism and religious fundamentalism as some of the challenges. On the external front, India was constantly facing the problem of cross-border terrorism, he added.

Stressing the need for promoting nationalistic outlook among the youth and involving them in constructive nation-building activities, he said: “All of us must strive to build a New India that is free of poverty, hunger, discrimination, and inequalities based on caste, creed, and gender”.

Shri Naidu advised student organizations such as Vidyarthi Parishad to instill the feeling of ‘nation first’ among the youth and encourage them to actively participate in national development. He called upon the youth to work with a missionary zeal and determination to transform India into a prosperous and happy nation.

Stating that India has a great demographic dividend with more than 65% of its population below the age of 35 years, the Vice President stressed the need to impart knowledge and skills to youth for effectively meeting the challenges of technology-driven the 21st century.

Observing that this was the age of innovation, incubation, and start-ups, he called for tapping the entrepreneurial potential among the youth of the country.

Stating that changing the face of our rural and backward villages was essential for inclusive development, the Vice President said that the critical challenge was to deploy the best possible ideas in the innovation-led development of the rural areas of the nation, where 60 percent of its population lives.

Describing the urban-rural divide in the country as a challenge, Shri Naidu called for planned and systematic initiatives to revive the rural economy. He stressed the need to strengthen the rural economy by empowering rural artisans, farmers and women.

Stating that advancement in technology, expansion of new and modern healthcare facilities provide an opportunity to address urban-rural divide, the Vice President said that there was an urgent need to make agriculture more sustainable and profitable.

Shri Naidu also called for a people’s movement to conserve water resources, ensure a sustainable  development and maintain the ecological balance. He said that climate change was real and affecting all species on the planet.

The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the Chairman, Piramal Group & Shriram Group, Shri Ajay Piramal, the National Organizing Secretary, ABVP, Shri Sunil Ambedkar, the National General Secretary, ABVP, Shri Ashish Chauhan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I express my gratitude to the organizers for having invited me to deliver the first Prof. Yashwantrao Kelkar memorial lecture.

I recollect him as a selfless, simple, affable, affectionate and a caring individual. He was a friend philosopher and guide to many people.

Yashwantrao was a man of high intellect, knowledge and great qualities of head and heart and it was impossible for anyone who came in contact with him to remain untouched by his illumination.

One of his great qualities was the immediate connect he used to establish with the younger generation. He always used to have animated discussions with them and believed in instilling samskara and nation first attitude. He used to stress on sharpening the intellect of the youth and involving them in nation-building activities. He had inspired and shaped thousands of students to work selflessly for the country throughout their lifetime.

He was the main architect of ABVP and he conceptualized, designed and successfully implemented a unique working methodology of ABVP.

The important organizational principles he believed in are --planning in advance and planning in detail; Everybody is important but nobody is indispensable;  Each one is incomplete but when many such incomplete individuals come together, they form a whole; Teamwork is the essence of an organization.

He used to say that we are human beings and not machines. We can make mistakes, so accept everyone as he is, but develop him as we want him to be.

These are the principles he inculcated in ABVP and had thus built a strong, vibrant, forward-looking, sensitive and nationalistic student’s organization.

He gave purpose and goal to the life of thousands of students and youth and made them participate in all walks of life with nation-first attitude. The Indian philosophy with its unique definition of the relationship between individual, society, nature, creation and the creator and its distinct concept of human happiness provides the basis for meeting the multi-pronged challenges faced by the world community today.

Dear Friends,

India is an ancient civilization and always believed in the philosophy of Vasudhaika Kutumbakam. India was the knowledge hub in ancient times and was known as ‘Vishwaguru’. World famous learning centres like Nalanda, Pushpagiri and Takshshila attracted scholars and knowledge seekers from far and wide.

Although, India was a flourishing trading centre and contributed up to 25 per cent of the world GDP some centuries ago, we never attacked anybody or entertained designs to conquer an alien territory. We always believed in peaceful co-existence with all, including our neighbours. Our country has achieved great heights by enlightening the world with its intellectual and spiritual wisdom. From zero to yoga, India has made numerous contributions to the enrichment of the world’s intellectual and spiritual progress.

While taking pride in our accomplishments and achievements from ancient times till now, we all should strive to preserve, protect and promote India’s rich culture, traditions, values and ethos. A corollary of the concept of seeing the whole world as one family is the attitude of empathy, of sharing and caring, of a sharp focus on alleviating the agony of fellow human beings.

There is a need to promote nationalistic outlook among the youth and involve them in constructive nation-building activities. All of us must strive to build a New India that is free of poverty, hunger, discrimination and inequalities based on caste, creed and gender.

Student organizations such as Vidyarthi Parishad must instill the feeling of ‘nation first’ among the youth and encourage them to actively participate in national development.

We have a great demographic dividend and more than 65% of our population is young. We need to impart knowledge and skills to our youth for effectively meeting the challenges of technology-driven the 21st century. This is the age of innovation, incubation and start-ups and we must fully tap the entrepreneurial potential among the youth of the country.

Dear youngsters,

Even 70 years after Independence, the country is facing  challenges on different fronts—about 20 per cent of the population is still living in poverty and an equal percentage of people are not literate; instances of social, gender discrimination and atrocities against women are happening now and then; then there is the canker of corruption; casteism and religious fundamentalism. On the external front, India is constantly facing the problem of cross-border terrorism.

One of the most glaring challenges is the urban-rural divide. With the advancement in technology, expansion of new and modern healthcare facilities, we have a tremendous opportunity to bridge the gap between urban and rural areas. Planned and systematic initiatives are needed to revive the rural economy. For that to happen, there is an urgent need to make agriculture more sustainable and profitable.

As you all are aware, the village economy relies mostly on agriculture, while the cities and urban centers have seen a growth led by services and manufacturing sectors.

We need to create economic avenues for rural artisans, farmers, women, and the youth by ensuring education and empowering them to use technology.

The critical challenge is to deploy the best possible ideas in the innovation-led development of the rural areas of the nation, where 60 percent of its population lives. Changing the face of our rural and backward villages is an essential component of inclusive development.

It is extremely important for the youth to participate in a big way to eradicate the social evils, poverty and illiteracy. They also should be in the forefront of eliminating casteism and religious fundamentalism. In spite of the challenges, India is marching ahead in various fields from space exploration to sports with our men and women bringing laurels and global recognition to our country.

As mentioned earlier, we need to fully tap the youthful energy into fast-tracking the nation’s progress and make India a five trillion dollar economy in the coming years. Young India’s aspirations and their united efforts would determine the future of the country.

Another important issue that I have been flagging often is the need to completely overhaul the education system to prepare students to effectively face the challenges of the 21st century. 

We need an education system that transforms a student to become a complete human being, who is sensitive to the needs of others, understands the other point of view and respects and values others for what they are. 

We need to revamp the education system and reorient the curriculum to suit the needs of the 21st century, while upholding the Indian values and ethos at the same time. I have also been advocating that education should inculcate morals, ethics, empathy, sensitivity and respect for women and elders. The New Education Policy must focus more on incorporating a complete and comprehensive history of India, apart from our rich culture and heritage.

There is also a need to make it education more equitable and inclusive. Policy makers and the educationists must ensure that every child receives holistic education.

India should once again become a Vishwaguru and the hub of innovation and knowledge. For that to happen, we have to drastically revamp the education system to make our institutions of higher learning and universities the centres of excellence with international standards.

Dear youngsters, I would also like you to be in the forefront of protecting our natural resources.

As you all are aware, climate change is real and affecting all species on the planet.  For long, we have tinkered with nature and it is showing its fury on us. I feel that a people’s movement is needed to conserve water resources, ensure a sustainable model of development and maintain the ecological balance. Protect nature and preserve culture for a better future.

Before concluding, I call upon the youth to work with a missionary zeal and determination to transform India into a prosperous and happy nation.

JAI HIND!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for presenting a “real history” of India to the younger generations as there were many distortions in the history drafted by the colonial rulers.

 

Presenting Punyabhushan Award to eminent Archeologist, Dr. G.B. Deglurkar, in Pune, Maharashtra today, he said that unfortunately our history books did not mention about the contributions made by many illustrious sons and daughters of India. The award has been instituted by the Punyabhushan Foundation.

 

Pointing out that India than 3,600 monuments of national importance were being protected and preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Shri Naidu said that it was important to protect and conserve the glorious history of the country embedded in these structures. “All of them are relics of India’s past and symbols of our cultural expressions,” he added.

 

“Archaeological sites act as the bridges to connect the present with the past and reveal different facets of the past to mankind. Archeology has tremendous potential to ‘reconstruct’ and ‘re-correct’ history,” he added.

 

Talking about the importance of Archaeology, Shri Naidu said that it was the responsibility of every citizen of the country to protect and preserve the monuments and pass on them to future generations. 

 

The Vice President called upon Public sector and private sector firms as well as individuals to adopt archeological sites and take part in the preservation of our great heritage. He said people’s participation was essential in strengthening the Government’s efforts in conservation of important archaeological sites.

 

The Vice President said that the time has arrived to bring together various academic disciplines such as history, archaeology, anthropology, iconography, epigraphy and sociology to establish a strong correlation of the literature, history and archaeological data for better understanding of the past. “I am sure that this approach will help us to make a fundamental contribution to textual and archaeological study of the epics of India”, he added.

 

Pointing out that archaeology helps in discovering not only ‘other’ civilizations but also in rediscovering our ‘own’ selves, he stressed the need to create greater awareness about monuments and their importance among the students. The Vice President urged schools and colleges to organize visits of students to nearby archaeological and historical monuments and encourage them to take part in upkeep activities and Cleanliness Drives at those monuments.

 

Shri Naidu appreciated the efforts of NGOs like the Aga Khan Trust who have undertaken the restoration of monuments in few cities, and conservation and restoration of the Sri Ranganatha Swamy temple at Srirangam undertaken by the government with the help of donors and said that many similar efforts were needed.

 

Shri Naidu also praised the organizers for felicitating ‘Veermata’, Smt. Lata Nair, Freedom Fighter, Mohammed Chandbhai Sheikh, War-injured Soldiers, Shri Naik Fulsingh and Shri Govind Biradar on the occasion. “I take this opportunity to salute these great warriors of nationalism and countless unsung heroes, who laid down their lives for the freedom of Mother India”, he added.

 

The Founder of Sancheti Hospital, Dr. K.H. Sancheti, the Founder of Symbiosis International University, Dr. S.B. Majumdar, eminent classical vocalist, Dr. Prabha Atre, former Captain of Indian Cricket Team, Shri Chandrakant Borde, the President, Punyabhushan Foundation, Dr. Satish Desai and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""It gives me immense pleasure to be present here in the historical and yet modern city of Pune, the cultural centre of Maharashtra and present the prestigious Punyabhushan Award.

It is indeed a unique civilian award, which blends well with the great cultural tradition of Pune city.

I always look forward to visit this historical city of Chhatrapati Shri. Shivaji Maharaj and salute this greatest king of India. Whenever I visit this city, I draw inspiration from the rich heritage of the city, nourished by the great nationalists, social reformers and educationists.

Pune has always been a centre of patriotism, equality and education and attracted people from all over the country. The Father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi had described this Punyanagari as the ‘bee-hive of social workers’.

On this occasion, I sincerely offer my homage to the great social reformer-couple, Mahatma Jotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule; one of the tallest leaders of India’s movement for independence, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak; great liberal thinkers Justice Mahadeo Govind Ranade and Dr. Gopal Krishna Gokhale; renowned Orientologist Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar; educationist Dr. Dhondo Keshav Karve and social reformer Maharshi Vitthal Ramji Shinde and many more leaders.

I am also happy to note that the citizens, who had made an exceptional contribution in different fields at the national and international level, are being recognized and felicitated from time to time. These felicitations are meant to inspire others.

I appreciate the endeavours of ‘Punyabhushan Foundation’ to commemorate the memory of the greatest ‘trio’ of our freedom struggle-- Shahid Bhagatsingh, Sukhadeo and Rajguru. I am aware of the fact that Hutatma Rajguru comes from Rajgurunagar in Pune District.

It is commendable on the part of organizers to remember and honour the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters in this function today. We owe our freedom to them. I take this opportunity to salute these great warriors of nationalism and countless unsung heroes, who laid down their lives for the freedom of Mother India.

I am also glad to know that stalwarts like, Bharat Ratna Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Dr. Banoo Coyajee, Dr. R. N. Dandekar, Shri. Shantanurao Kirloskar, Shri. B. K. S. Iyyengar, Shri. Mohan Dharia ji, Dr. Jayant Naralikar and many more were recipients of the Punyabhushan Award earlier. The recipients of the award have made commendable contributions to their chosen fields and made every Indian proud.

On this occasion, I specially congratulate Dr. G. B. Deglurkar, for being the recipient of the Punyabhushan Award for his long-standing contribution to the field of the Indian Archaeology through the world renowned Deccan College Post graduate and Research Institute.

Dear friends,

Respecting the Guru, recognizing the talent and merit is part of Indian culture. It is central to India’s rich traditions. Rewarding an achiever with a medal or prize money is to inspire others to do well in their respective fields.

As you are aware, Archaeology and Archaeological sites are the bridges that connect the present with our past. Archaeology is a fascinating subject that enhances our understanding of history through hard evidence. Because of this characteristic, it can be more credible than any other human science.

Archaeology plays a significant role in revealing different facets of the past. It is the primary source of information for prehistory and proto-history and it is very useful in revealing different facets of the past to the mankind. I believe that it has tremendous potential to ‘reconstruct’ and ‘re-correct’ history.

Archaeology helps in bringing to light the diversity in varied cultures and civilizations. It helps in discovering not only the ‘other’ civilizations but also in rediscovering our ‘own’ selves.

Disciplines like archaeology play an invaluable role in making us rediscover our roots by connecting us with our past.

India is a vast and culturally-rich nation. As on January, 2019 we have more than 3,600 monuments of national importance protected and preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). These archaeological sites are relics of our past and symbols of our cultural expressions. Our glorious history is embedded in these structures.

History and culture belong to everybody. People’s participation is essential in strengthening the Government’s efforts in conservation of important archaeological sites.

It is the responsibility of every citizen of the country to protect and preserve the monuments and pass on them to future generations.

Public sector companies, private sector firms as well as individuals must be encouraged to adopt sites and take part in the preservation of our heritage.

Notable NGOs like the Aga Khan Trust have undertaken restoration of monuments in few cities. Similarly, the conservation and restoration of the Sri Ranganatha Swamy temple at Srirangam was undertaken by the government with the help of donors.

There is also a need to create greater awareness about these monuments and their importance among the students. Schools and colleges must organize visits by students to nearby archaeological and historical monuments and also involve the students in regular Cleanliness Drives at those monuments.

Indian civilization is one of the oldest and unique in many ways. In a historical evolution, Col. Meadows Taylor of the early nineteenth century did pioneering work on the archaeology of India. His interest, however, remained more concentrated on the south Indian Megaliths. However, Alexander Cunningham in 1861 and Robert Bruce Foote in 1863 began their explorations and recording of prehistoric antiquities of the country in the subsequent period. The Archaeological Survey of India was established in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham, with a view to initiate archaeological research and the conservation and preservation of cultural monuments in India.

With the advent of the Archaeological Survey of India, thousands of historians were attracted to study Archaeology as well as Indology. Just to mention, Legendary Archaeologist B.B.Lal has done enormous contribution to the field of archeology with excavations that cover a wide range -- from Paleolithic times to early historical. Also,  from this very city of Pune- Dr. R. R. Bhandarkar, Dr. H. D. Sankalia, Dr. R. N. Dandekar, Dr. S. B. Deo, Dr. M. K. Dhavalikar, Dr. Z. D. Ansari, Dr. Smt. Shobhana Gokhale, Dr. Nagaraja Rao, Dr. M. S. Mate, made an exceptional contribution to this specialized field, though it originated and evolved in European countries in the 19th and 20th centuries .The discovery of the Harappan civilization is an excellent example of the immense potential in archaeology as a discipline. And in light of this, I consider that Dr. Deglurkar too belongs to this exclusive club of the stalwart Archaeologists and their glorious tradition.

I therefore have no hesitation in holding especially Pune’s Deccan College and Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in high esteem, next to the Archaeological Survey of India, for playing a pivotal role in promoting Archaeology, Sanskrit scholarship and Museum Studies in India.

I am highly impressed particularly by Deglurkar’s discoveries through excavations in different parts of India. When he excavated identical ivory dolls respectively from the sites at ‘Bhokardan’ in Jalna district of Maharashtra and ‘Pompeii’ in Italy, he conclusively established the presence of Roman tradesmen in this region during Satvahana rule. Similarly, Dr. Deglurkar made an everlasting contribution to the field of ‘Iconography’ too.

In light of the recent advances in the field of archaeological studies, many historians, Sanskrit scholars and archaeologists belonging to different schools of thought in India have been debating for a long time whether Ramayana and Mahabharata are ‘itihaas’ or ‘kaavya’.

I feel that the time has come to bring together various academic disciplines such as history, archaeology, anthropology, iconography, epigraphy and sociology. I am sure that this kind of multi-disciplinary approach will enable us to establish a strong correlation of the literature, history and archaeological data. I am sure that this approach will help us to make a fundamental contribution to textual and archaeological study of the epics of India.

I hope that the historians and archaeologists, who follow Sanskrit tradition, will take up this challenge and enable us to unearth the hidden details of the past with more concrete evidences and give a new direction to our illuminating historical and cultural heritage.

Mark Twain, one of the most celebrated authors and humorists from America beautifully described our country. I quote: “India is the cradle of human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, grandmother of legend, and great grandmother of tradition. Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only” (unquote).

The city of Pune has shown light to the country on many occasions. I am sure, Pune will live up to the great legacy of high quality of educational, cultural, historical and social institutions and provide an impetus to undertake research in Indology, Sanskrit and Ancient History.

I once again congratulate Dr. G. B. Deglurkar for receiving the prestigious Punyabhushan Award and thank the Punyabhushan Foundation for inviting me to this function this morning. My special thanks to the learned audience of Pune for their presence today morning.

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today said that skilling of youth should become national movement and urged all stakeholders to participate in a mission- mode to accomplish this objective.

Speaking at the National Institute of Personnel Management Personnel (NIPM) 2019 conference on ‘India’s Changing Paradigm: Skills and Entrepreneurship for Global Competitiveness’ in Bengaluru today, he pointed out that automation and artificial intelligence would greatly influence the requirements of the industry.

He said that while fundamental skills, like literacy, basic understanding of computer, internet, and communication skills were extremely relevant, it was equally important to anticipate the innovation and breakthrough processes required for the future and ensure the availability of high quality work force to meet the demands of different sectors.

Calling for a paradigm shift in the way people perceive skilling and entrepreneurship, he said a renewed focus on aspects such as ‘scale’ ‘speed’ and ‘quality’ was needed to make India competitive in the skill and entrepreneurship arena.

Urging educational institutions and academicians to inculcate the spirit of entrepreneurship right from school age, Shri Naidu said “empower the youth to become job creators rather than becoming job seekers"".

Stressing the need to eliminating digital and gender gaps and inequalities in knowledge acquisition, the Vice President said that strong foundations must be laid to provide vocational and technical skills to rural youth. There is a need to have a good mix of formal education, off-the-job and on-the-job training.

Stating that nearly 54 percent of the Indian population was under 25 years and 65 per cent of population below 35 years, the Vice President called for steps to encourage them to learn new technology and adapt to the changing technological requirements.

“Skill does not mean only knowing a task or performing a certain activity with precision. It is the willingness and readiness of the person to learn new things,” he added. 

Shri Naidu has said that creating a workforce with appropriate skilling was important to reduce unemployment, raise incomes, and improve standards of living. “It not only guarantees employment but also helps in the socio-economic development of people, especially women,” he added. 

Calling for active participation of Industry, educational institutions and vocational training centers to realize the huge potential offered by various programs like Start-Up, The Vice President asked the business leaders and HR leaders to mine talents as skilling assumed greater importance than ever before in the 21st century technology-dependent job market.

Shri Naidu also suggested revamping the education system in a holistic manner from the primary school level to higher education with a greater focus on academia-industry interaction and enhancing the component of vocational training are crucial for creating a skilled workforce. 

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am delighted to participate in NATCON 2019 conference on ‘India’s Changing Paradigm: Skills and Entrepreneurship for Global Competitiveness’’.

Indeed, the theme chosen by the National Institute of Personnel Management Personnel (NIPM) for NATCON 2019 is very apt.

Dear Friends,

As you all are aware, India is a young nation with nearly 54 percent of the total population under 25 years and 65 per cent of population below 35 years.

It is estimated that about 250 million young people will join India’s workforce over the next decade, bringing with them new skills in a rapidly changing competitive world. The new wave of technologies and digitization has transformed the industry in an unprecedented manner. As a result, the skills set needed for the future workforce in a world of disruptive technologies will be totally different. Automation and artificial intelligence will greatly influence the requirements of the industry. 

To enhance this journey of human development through focused skilling efforts and talent nurturing, many innovative approaches are being adopted by several stakeholders in the larger talent and skilling eco-system

While fundamental skills, like literacy, basic understanding of computer, internet, and communication skills either in mother tongue or English are extremely relevant, it is equally important to anticipate the innovation and breakthrough processes required for the future and ensure the availability of high quality work force to meet the demands of different sectors.

The World Economic Forum estimates that 35 percent of core skills will change causing more than a million people to seek different types of employment.i

I am must compliment NIPM for organizing this conference by keeping the future requirements in mind.

In the skill eco-space, Business leaders and HR leaders should mine talents as skilling is assuming greater importance than ever before this 21st century technology-dependent job market 

It should be noted that skill does not mean only knowing a task or performing a certain activity with precision. It means the willingness and readiness of the person to learn new technology and adapt to the changing technological requirements. 

As you all are aware, India ranks 80th on Global Talent Competitive Index according to a report released by INSEAD Business School in partnership with Tata Communications and Adecco Group in January 2019.

The report measured levels of Global Talent Competitiveness by looking at 68 variables such as ease of hiring, gender earnings gap and prevalence of training in firms. It said that India's biggest challenge was to improve its ability to attract and retain talent.


	a workforce with appropriate skilling is important to reduce unemployment, raise incomes, and improve standards of living. It not only guarantees employment but also helps in the socio-economic development of people, especially women. 


According to the World Bank, more than two billion working-age adults are not equipped with the most essential literacy skills required by employers. Among young adults under the age of 25, the number is about 420 million worldwide.

The rapidly changing global economy demands workers to be innovative, flexible and adaptive. It is important for companies, corporate and individual professional firms to invest in employee’s skill development, training and confidence-building.

Dear sisters and brothers, there is also a need to think beyond global skill supply and focus on creating more risk-taking entrepreneurs.

I appreciate the organizers for taking both entrepreneurship and skilling as two key focus areas of the event. One generates employment and the other makes a person eligible for employment.

As I have mentioned earlier, we have an excellent demographic dividend with youth as our strength.

In order to make India competitive in the skill and entrepreneurship arena, we must create an environment for entrepreneurship to thrive. This calls for a paradigm shift in the way we perceive skilling and entrepreneurship. Focus on scale, speed and quality are important.

Inculcating the spirit of entrepreneurship right from school age and empowering youth to become job creators rather than job seekers requires immediate attention.

Programs such as Skill India, Startup India, and Standup India should not be limited to government departments. Participation of Industry from all sectors, involving educational institutions and vocational training centers is extremely crucial for fully realizing the huge potential offered by those programs.

While we can be justifiably proud of India’s achievements in global indexes in respect of Milk Production, Remittance, and Global Retail Development and its below 10 ranking in the areas of Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness (2), Worlds Most valuable Nation Brand (7): Foreign Direct Investment- Confidence (8) and in Foreign Direct Investment inflows – (10), we have to focus on improving our global competitiveness index.

We need to collectively work towards eliminating inequalities in knowledge acquisition, close digital and gender gaps and intensify the efforts at skilling the youth on a war footing. Strong foundations must be laid to provide vocational and technical skills to rural youth. There is a need to have a good mix of formal education, off-the-job and on-the-job training.

Increased internet penetration provides an opportunity to train rural youth. Location-specific and Industry-centric skills are the best way to empower them. Otherwise, we will not be able to realize our demographic dividend.

Revamping our education system in a holistic manner from the primary school level to higher education with greater focus on academia-industry interaction and enhancing the component of vocational training are crucial for creating a skilled workforce. 

I do hope that the new education policy will address some of these issues. Education being on the concurrent list, central and state governments must work together in promoting vocation-based syllabus.

I am glad that as part of the reforms, the government has created a separate ministry for skill Development. The setting up of National Skill Development Council and formulating National Skills Qualification Framework are all steps in the right direction.

I am glad that you are deliberating on quality rather than quantity of skill supply against the demand for talent across sectors. Only if we are cost and quality competitive, we will attract more FDI and our products will be preferred beyond talent sourcing. 

Finally, before concluding, I would urge the industry to play a bigger role in developing a highly-skilled manpower that would not only meet the requirements not only of India, but the globe as well.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for revamping the education system to prepare students to effectively face the challenges of the 21st century, while upholding the Indian values and ethos at the same time.

Inaugurating the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of BHS Higher Education Society, in Bengaluru today, he wanted the New Education Policy to focus more on comprehensive history of India, apart from our rich culture and heritage. He said the history books should contain the contributions made by great freedom fighters from different parts of the country.

Shri Naidu said that our education system must make our institutions of higher learning and universities the centres of excellence with international standards.

“We need an education system that transforms a student to become a complete human being, who is sensitive to the needs of others, understands the other point of view and respects and values others for what they are,” he added.

The Vice President advised the teachers, educationists, researchers, and parents to make a study of the draft of the new education policy put forth by the government and make their suggestions to make it robust and more Indian, more equitable and inclusive.

“Policymakers and the educationists must ensure that every child receives a holistic education,” he added.

Expressing his concern over the rising cost of education, particularly and said that it was a worrisome trend.  Saying that education was the fundamental requirement and it must be made affordable, he asserted that providing quality education should not be equated with costly education.

There is also a need to make it education more equitable and inclusive. Policy makers and the educationists must ensure that every child receives holistic education. “I advise all the teachers gathered here, the educationists, researchers, and parents to make a study of the draft of the new education policy and make their suggestions to make it robust and more Indian”, he added. 

The Vice President also urged business associations, corporate firms, trusts, entrepreneurs and philanthropic organizations to create dedicated funds for the promotion of affordable education. 

Mentioning that India was a great repository of knowledge and wisdom and once upon a time it was known as Viswa Guru, he said that India’s ancient Gurukul education system with its Guru Shishya parampara used to provide value-based and holistic education, which empowered individuals. “We must once again get back to the roots”, he added.

Shri Naidu opined that any policy or strategy to provide universal education must ensure that the vulnerable sections of our population, the women, the differently-abled and the economically weak are fully covered.

Pointing out that 65% of the Indian population was below the age of 35, the Vice President said that education plays a pivotal role in realizing the demographic dividend. He called for steps to ensure that the educated and empowered youth, the human capital of the country, weree given adequate opportunities and support, especially in terms if skilling.

Shri Naidu also advised the Government, academia and the industry bodies to join hands in implementing rigorous academic standards and in creating the necessary infrastructure. 

Voicing his concern over instances of social and gender discrimination, he called for a change in the mindset of the people.

Shri Naidu also stressed the need for bridging the urban-rural divide and ensuring accessibility to affordable education to the people.

The Members of Parliament, Shri P.C. Mohan and Shri Tejasvi Surya, the President and Treasurer, BHS Higher Education Society, Shri G.V. Viswanath, the Vice President, BHS Higher Education Society, Shri N.B. Bhat, the Joint Secretary, BHS Higher Education Society, Dr. R.V. Prabhakara and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to participate in the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of BHS Higher Education Society in Bengaluru today. 

I was informed that the BHS Managing Committee was created in 1942 by a group of eminent educationists and philanthropists and was registered as a non-profit body dedicated to the cause of education.

I am glad to know that the mission of the BHS Higher Education Society is to achieve excellence in education so that it becomes the prime contributor to the development of self, society and diverse human enterprise.

I tend to agree with their mission. We are aware that education is the most powerful weapon that can transform the world. It completely changes the lives of the people and empowers them. It lays the foundation for a nation’s social and economic progress. Hence, it is important to ensure that every child has access to education. 

Needless to say that education plays a stellar role in protecting our democracy and ensuring the prosperity of our people.

In spite of the advances and efforts of the governments and people all over the world to make education available to everyone, millions of people are struggling for their survival and in trying to make both the ends meet. The root cause has been attributed to lack of literacy and want of proper education.

From time immemorial man’s quest for knowledge has guided mankind to shape a world of liberty, prosperity, and peace.

Our nation is a great repository of knowledge and wisdom and once upon a time was known as Viswa Guru. Our centres of learning such as Nalanda and Takshashila were world famous and knowledge-seekers from across the globe used to come and pursue their studies in those temples of learning.

Our ancient Gurukul education system with its Guru Shishya parampara used to provide value-based and holistic education, which empowered individuals.

Dear friends,

Education is the best way to empower individuals. It is the primary driving force that helps people grow and achieve their goals. Education gives us knowledge and helps us to bring about a positive change in an individual and the society at large.

Education is not just the accumulation of knowledge from textbooks. Albert Einstein once said that education is not the learning of facts but the training of the mind to think something that cannot be learned from text books. Sometimes, asking the right questions is more important than having the right answers.

We need an education system that transforms a student to become a complete human being, who is sensitive to the needs of others, understands the other point of view and respects and values others for what they are.

We need to revamp the education system and reorient the curriculum to suit the needs of the 21st century, while upholding the Indian values and ethos at the same time. The New Education Policy must focus more on incorporating a complete and comprehensive history of India, apart from our rich culture  and heritage.

There is also a need to make it education more equitable and inclusive. Policy makers and the educationists must ensure that every child receives holistic education. I advise all the teachers gathered here, the educationists, researchers, and parents to make a study of the draft of the new education policy and make their suggestions to make it robust and more Indian. 

India should once again become a Vishwaguru and the hub of innovation and knowledge. For that to happen, we have to drastically revamp the education system to make our institutions of higher learning and universities the centres of excellence with international standards. The Government, the academia and the industry bodies should join hands in implementing rigorous academic standards and in creating the necessary infrastructure.  

Dear Friends,

The rising cost of education, especially on the higher education front is a bit worrisome.  Since education is the fundamental requirement, it must be made affordable. Providing quality education should not be equated with costly education.

I call upon business associations, corporate firms, trusts, entrepreneurs and philanthropic organizations to create dedicated funds for the promotion of affordable education. 

Any policy or strategy to provide universal education must ensure that the vulnerable sections of our population, the women, the differently-abled and the economically weak are fully covered.

As all of you are aware, 65% of our population is below the age of 35 and education plays a pivotal role in realizing the demographic dividend. 

We must ensure that the educated and empowered youth who are human capital of the country must be given adequate opportunities and support, especially in terms if skilling.

Today’s India is young and aspirational. We must create an environment for talent to thrive. It is the job of both policy makers and the industry to see that the youth develop skills that are crucial to survive and sustain in the 21st-century technology-dependent job market.

Students passing out of senior secondary schools, colleges and other institutions must be provided an opportunity to learn skills and be provided with certificates along with academic certification.

It is advisable to organize industry internship programs during their academic courses. The higher education curriculum should be redesigned to ensure that students have internships at an industry or a company. Practical training is more important than acquiring bookish knowledge as it would go a long way in imparting the required skills to students.

Apart from imparting the right skills to the youth, we also need to establish a symbiotic relationship between the academia and the industry for creating the necessary ecosystem for innovation to thrive. Industry also needs to play a more pro-active role and establish a strong organic link with the academic institutions.

The industry should also come forward and lend a helping hand to educational institutions, particularly in terms of creating the needed infrastructure and equipment for undertaking high-quality research.

It is heartening to know that the objective of the BHS Higher Education Society is to provide an adult-learning environment with programmes designed to be responsive to the present and future needs of individuals, community and society.

I was happy to know that their curriculum integrates traditional higher education with innovative concepts to enable the students meet the demands of a diverse community and a complex society.

I was impressed to know that the society started the RURAL EDUCATION PROJECT in 1990 at T. Narasipura, near Mysore for the benefit of rural students and the youth.

Before I conclude, I covey my best wishes and appreciation to the management and staff of the institution for their service to society. 

Dear students, you must not deviate from the righteous path and remain committed to upholding ethics and morals at all times. You must always have an inquisitive mind and simply not remain complacent with the status quo.

As you step out of the portals of this institution, many of you might look for employment and many others might decide to pursue further studies. Irrespective of what you propose to do, one thing is clear---opportunities are aplenty and make yourself capable of utilizing these opportunities to the fullest possible extent. I am sure that all of you will have bright and fulfilling careers.

My best wishes to you all!""

Pointing out that elections were being regularly held in Jammu and Kashmir and MPs, MLAs and Sarpanchs to local bodies were getting elected, he said the reorganization of the Jammu and Kashmir was an internal matter. “We don’t want to interfere in the internal affairs of any country and we don’t anybody else to interfere in our affairs”, he added.

Criticizing a neighboring country for aiding, abetting, training and funding terror, he said that India always believed in having peaceful relations with all countries, including her neighbours.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for making India a thriving hub for natural healing and wellness in the world.

 

Inaugurating the 150th Birth Anniversary Celebrations of Vaidyaratnam, Shri P.S. Varier, at Kottakkal in Kerala today, he said “ I strongly believe that India has the capability to become the wellness capital of the world. It is home to centuries old traditional systems of medicine and wellness practices that not only foster physical health but also mental and spiritual wellbeing”.

 

Observing that from ancient times India had a very systematic, scientific and rationale approach to the treatment of diseases, he said “The Atharva Veda is a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom in the field of medicine. It is lauded as the earliest source of medical information in India”, he added.

 

Referring to the important role played by Ayurveda since ancient times, he said that despite, the non-supportive political environment created by foreign rulers, Ayurveda survived, thrived and earned global recognition as a benign healthcare science with time-tested healing and wellness capabilities. “It is not just a system of medicine. It is also a philosophy of life,” he added.

 

The Vice President stressed that research in traditional systems of medicine must lead to evidence-based improvement in treatment protocols and help in producing medicines of excellent quality so that India becomes a thriving centre for natural healing and wellness in the world.

 

Expressing his concern over the disturbing trend of increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer and hypertension in India, he said there was an urgent need to shift focus from the treatment of these diseases to their prevention and general wellness.

 

He said that holistic and comprehensive approach adopted by Ayurveda could play an important role in treating chronic and lifestyle diseases. Shri Naidu advised the youngsters to shun junk food and always remain physically fit.

 

While calling for promoting indigenous systems of medicine, he also stressed the need for integrating and harmonizing traditional systems like Ayurveda with the modern allopathic system for enhancing the efficacy of treatments.

 

“As a practicing science, the system of Ayurveda needs to be strengthened through research.  The ancient wisdom in this traditional system of medicine is still not exhaustively explored,” the Vice President said.

 

Observing that ancient system of medicine using herbs and plants exists all over the globe, the Vice President said there should be a regular exchange of information between nations to further strengthen healing protocols based on natural remedies.

 

Shri Naidu said that the dialogue between natural healing practices of nations should be constantly nurtured so that knowledge does not stagnate and innovation happens constantly. However, any protocol or practice must be evidence-based.

 

Referring to the evolving technologies of Molecular Biology and DNA profiling, Shri Naidu observed that exploration for new knowledge must happen constantly, especially in fields such as Ayurveda. He said that research in such areas would be helpful in learning more about plants and their properties.

 

He also paid rich compliments to Shri P K Varier, the Managing Trustee and added that he was the shining example of good lifestyle and dietary practices.

 

The Governor of Kerala, Shri Arif Mohammad Khan, the Minister for Higher Education, Kerala, Dr. K.T. Jaleel, the Managing Trustee, Arya Vaidya Sala, Dr. P.K. Varier and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""It is a matter of pleasure for me to be able to visit Kerala and especially Kottakkal once again.

 

I am particularly happy that my visit to Arya Vaidya Sala (AVS), Kottakkal is on a very important occasion.  Today we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Vaidyaratnam P.S. Varier, a great visionary who brought about a renaissance of Ayurveda, over the course of the last century.

 

As all of you know, the long years of foreign domination sought to make the country poorer materially and spiritually. However, the hard toil of several national heroes led to rediscovering the real India in all its splendid glory.

 

I position P.S. Varier in the category of Indian Renaissance leaders who drew heavily upon both the oriental and the occidental treasure troves of wisdom.

 

His karma mandala, as all of us know, was primarily the organising, updating and contemporising of the traditional Indian health care science of Ayurveda. Let me state here with conviction that he excelled in his mission like no one else did.

 

Though Vaidyaratnam P.S. Varier was an ardent follower of Indian traditions, he was not satisfied by merely dwelling on past glories and had set his vision on the future.

 

His greatest achievement, I would think, was the finesse with which he incorporated the principles and methods of modern knowledge into the traditional science of Ayurveda. This was done without compromising on the basic essentialities of Ayurveda.

 

He was also a successful Institution builder. The 117 year-old Arya Vaidya Sala,  100 year-old Ayurveda College , 87 year-old Vishwambhara Temple, 85 year-old Herb Garden of AVS and the 80 year-old Kathakali academy here are living monuments of his institution-building efforts.

 

He considered it as his mission to give quality, affordable health care to those who could not afford it. The Charitable Hospital, set up by him 95 years ago, is an eloquent testimony to his philanthropy.

 

I must also compliment the 98 year-old Dr. P.K. Warrier, who has nurtured and expanded this Charitable Organisation as Managing Trustee for the past 66 years.

 

My dear sisters and brothers,

 

I strongly believe that India has the capability to become the wellness capital of the world. It is home to centuries old traditional systems of medicine and wellness practices that not only foster physical health but also mental and spiritual wellbeing

 

From ancient times, India had a very systematic, scientific and rationale approach to the treatment of diseases. The Atharva Veda is a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom in the field of medicine. It is lauded as the earliest source of medical information in India.

 

Ayurveda has been regarded as an upaveda or a subtext of the Atharva Veda. Its history can be traced back to the 6th Century BC.

 

The foundations of Ayurveda were laid by the ancient schools of Hindu philosophical teachings-- Vaisheshika and the school of logic named as Nyaya.

 

The Charaka Samhita, the Sushrutha Samhita and the Ashtanaga Hridaya are the other texts that contain a wealth of knowledge about Ayurveda.

 

The mantras in the Atharva Veda contain a wealth of information regarding herbs, metals, medicines, diseases and treatments. They speak of the astounding properties and powers that plants possess to cure diseases.

 

The therapeutic principles of Ayurveda focus on prakriti and tridoshas. These principles propound that every individual has his unique constitution and responds differently to treatment and medication.

 

 In Ayurveda, it is believed, that a perfect balance between the nature elements and the Tridoshas of the human body should be maintained for a healthy state of living.

 

The practice of Ayurveda is based on a very sound knowledge base which is documented in hundreds of classical Treatises written in the classical language of Sanskrit as well as in several other Indian languages.

 

It has an uninterrupted history of providing primary and even tertiary health care services to vast populations of India during the past several centuries.

 

Ayurveda enjoyed the patronage of a number of rulers in ancient India. The Mauryan State is said to have given Ayurveda an institutional base, initiated by the exigencies of trade, commerce and agriculture.

 

In spite of the non-supportive political environment created by foreign rulers, Ayurveda still survived and thrived. Today, Ayurveda  is recognised globally as a benign health care science with time-tested healing and wellness capabilities. It is not just a system of medicine; it is also a philosophy of life.

 

It perceives humans as an integral part of nature. It entails a holistic way of life where individuals are in harmony with themselves and with the world that surrounds them

 

 Its approach to health and wellness is firmly rooted in the unique Indian philosophy of life. The essence of Ayurvedic healing philosophy rests in the divine diction enshrined in the Vedas.

 

The Shantimantra from the Brihadaranyakopanishad exhorts:

 

“Sarve bhavantu sukhinah

 

Sarve santu niraamayaah”

 

Meaning “May all be happy! May all be free from diseases!”

 

Ayurveda has now evolved as an effective health care system based on observations, empiricism and intuitive logic.

 

I understand that during its evolution during the past several centuries, it has assimilated useful inputs from parallel streams of knowledge and wisdom. It never remained insulated from diverse sciences.

 

Its operational modality is what has been proclaimed by the Vedas: ''Aano bhadra krtavo yantu vishwatah''

 

Meaning “Let noble thoughts enter from everywhere”

 

(Rig Veda, 1.89.1)  Interestingly, just like many other oriental bodies of knowledge, Ayurveda has also evolved and developed many regional traditions adding to its versatility. 

 

We must safeguard and promote this tradition of meaningful assimilation of ideas.  Ancient systems of medicine using herbs and plants exist all over the globe. There should be a regular exchange of information between nations to further strengthen healing protocols based on natural remedies.

 

This dialogue between natural healing practices of nations should be constantly nurtured so that knowledge does not stagnate and innovation happens constantly. However, any protocol or practice must be evidence-based.

 

Today, Ayurveda is increasingly being recognised, especially for its time-tested capabilities in dealing with non-communicable diseases, musculo-skeletal disorders, degenerative and life-style ailments and pre-and-post natal care.

 

India is now witnessing a disturbing trend of increasing incidence of life-style diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.

 

There is an urgent need to shift our focus from the treatment of these diseases to their prevention and general wellness.

 

Ayurvedic practices and wellness solutions coupled with yoga and other forms of physical exercise can go a long way in preventing and controlling these life-style related illnesses.

 

As a matter-of-fact, there is a need to integrate and harmonise traditional systems like Ayurveda with the modern allopathic system for enhancing the efficacy of treatments. The holistic and comprehensive approach adopted in Ayurveda could play an important role in treating chronic and lifestyle diseases.

 

I am told that institutions like AVS are evolving new therapeutic modalities to deal with the ailments of modern times like Cancer, Motor Neuron Diseases and Autism.

 

I must also refer to the Governmental initiatives in this regard. Whether it is education, drug manufacture, marketing, clinical institutions, or pharmaco-vigilance, there are strict Governmental regulations.

 

Drug manufacturers need Government license and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) approval from Drug Licensing Authority. Hospitals can opt for NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals) accreditation.  I am told that the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Committee of India has brought out several Technical Monographs.

 

There is a dedicated Ministry of AYUSH and a Department of AYUSH for promotion of traditional systems of Indian medicine. As you all are aware, thousands of Public Wellness Centres have been established across the country with the participation of AYUSH department and many more are being set up.

 

As a practising science, the system of Ayurveda needs to be strengthened through research.  The ancient wisdom in this traditional system of medicine is still not exhaustively explored.

 

New arenas of science such as ‘Ayurgenomics’ that bridge the gap between genomics and Ayurveda, serving as an aid in understanding of inter-individual differences in responses to therapies, are coming up.

 

We must make use of the latest technologies in the fields of Molecular Biology and DNA profiling to learn more about plants and their properties. Exploration for new knowledge must happen constantly.

 

All the new knowledge acquired must also be diligently documented so that it is transferred to the next generation.

 

I am happy to refer here to the support of the Government in this matter.  The CCRAS (Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences) and its different centres are undertaking extensive research activities.

 

More recently, a Task Force in Ayurvedic Biology has been set up under the Department of Science and Technology to extend support to National Research Institutions and Ayurvedic institutions to strengthen fundamental research in Ayurveda.

 

I am happy to note that several research papers have  been published in peer-reviewed International Journals like Nature and Plos-One on Ayurvedic concepts like prakriti and rasayana.

 

Nature is a natural healer. Several plants found in nature have some medicinal value. India is a treasure trove of botanical wealth. Exploration, identification, collection, documentation and conservation of medicinal plants should be accorded the highest priority by everyone associated with the study and promotion of Ayurveda.

 

I note with appreciation that Arya Vaidya Sala has partnered with modern institutions like IIT, BARC and BHU for undertaking research.

 

All research must lead to evidence-based improvement in treatment protocols and help in producing medicines of excellent quality so that India becomes a thriving centre for natural healing and wellness in the world.

 

Before concluding, I must pay my tributes to Vaidyaratnam P.S. Varier.

 

P.S. Varier was an exceptional person, an effective clinician with a unique healing touch, an academician-cum-educator par-excellence, a benevolent entrepreneur, a philanthropist, a man of letters, a promoter of fine arts and above all a representative of Indian renaissance.

 

As the Arya Vaidya Sala embarks upon a series of academic, social and public functions in the coming months as part the 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations of the illustrious P.S. Varier, I wish Arya Vaidya Sala and its Management Team and all the staff members who work under the leadership and guidance of Dr. P.K. Warrier, a very bright future in the coming years.

 

I hope that Arya Vidya Sala will remain a name that is synonymous with authentic Ayurveda.

 

Thank you!

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has stressed the need to introduce structural reforms to make agriculture profitable and sustainable.

Presenting Rythu Nestham Awards on the occasion of the 15th Anniversary of the publication of Rythu Nestham and two other journals Pasu Nestam and Prakruti Nestam at a function held in Swarna Bharat Trust, in Hyderabad today, he urged the Union Government and various State Governments to accord highest priority to agriculture, education and healthcare sectors.

With 60 per cent of the population dependent on agriculture, he said the foremost priority must be accorded to promoting agriculture and making it viable and remunerative. Observing that there was a need for agricultural renaissance in the country, he said that there should be more focus on ensuring insurance, irrigation and infrastructure development, apart from providing timely credit to farmers.

Pointing out that the Indian farmer was doing a pious duty in feeding millions of people, Shri Naidu said that the agriculture producer was getting less, while the trader was getting more. The government and the NITI Aayog should look into this aspect and make structural changes so that the farmer gets his due.

The Vice President also emphasized the need for diversification in agriculture and promotion of allied sectors like horticulture, poultry, pisciculture, aquaculture and sericulture to augment the income of the farmers.  Food processing was one area which has immense potential and needs to be fully tapped, he added.

Urging scientists to find ways for reducing the input costs for agriculture, Shri Naidu also called for revamping the curriculum of agricultural courses to ensure that students spend at 50 per cent of their study time by interacting with farmers in the fields. Spending time with the farmer in the field would be a huge learning experience for the students, he added.

The Vice President also cautioned people against the growing incidence of lifestyle diseases and said that it was important to adopt healthy dietary practices. He also advised people to protect nature and preserve culture for a better future.  

The Governor of Telangana, Dr. Tamilisai Soundararajan, the Chairman of Andhra Pradesh Official Language Commission,  Shri Yarlagadda Lakshmiprasad and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Addressing the gathering after inaugurating a Free Medical Camp organized by the KIMS Hospitals at the Swarna Bharat Trust, in Hyderabad today, he said that medical colleges and medical institutions should organize visits by medical professionals to nearby colleges and conduct awareness campaigns on disease prevention and adopting lifestyles.

Observing that people tend to neglect their health and take basic precautions, he said that many a time they incur huge healthcare costs for treatment of ailments. Hence awareness on disease prevention was extremely important as prevention is better than cure, he added.

Pointing out that sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy dietary habits were leading to increase in non-communicable diseases, he said that regular physical activity should become part of daily routine for everybody, irrespective of age.

The Governor of Telangana, Dr. Tamilisai Soundararajan, the former Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Dr. Kamineni Sreenivas and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon the private sector to play a bigger role in important nation-building activities such as infrastructure development and improving health and education sectors.

Inaugurating the 11th Project Management National Conference, in Hyderabad today, he said that public-private partnerships would be the order of the day for big projects like SMART Cities.

Observing that Project Managers were extremely important for a nation's progress, Shri Naidu said these were times for immense changes and the knowledge and skills of project managers would have a positive impact on the industry and the country's economy.

Describing India as a land of engineering and architectural wonders that serve as examples of great project management practices from the ancient temples of Mahabalipuram to the Ashoka Pillar, the Vice President said that modern-day India too has several remarkable achievements such as the newly-inaugurated State of Unity on the banks of Narmada and implementation of AADHAR, the world's largest biometric database.

Recalling his own experience in launching big projects earlier as the Minister for Rural Development in Shri Vajpayee's cabinet and as Minister for Housing and Urban Development in Shri Narendra Modi's cabinet, Shri Naidu cited the examples of the Pradhan Mantri Grammen Sadak Yojana, Swachh Bharat, SMART Cities, Housing and the Prime Minister's Awas Yojana.

Talking about the successful implementation of Schemes such as Swachh Bharat, Jan Dhan, Pradhan Mantri Ujwala Yojana and others, Shri Naidu said that bold initiatives such as these need champions who would inspire the team to work towards achieving bigger goals. In the case of Jan Dhan Yojana, the Prime Minister championed this greatest financial inclusion program in the world, he observed.

The Vice President welcomed the bold decision announced by the government to cut corporate tax as it will stimulate economic growth.

""The big project management challenge is to change people's perceptions and win their support for lasting impact,"" he added.

Stressing that all programmes must aim at achieving inclusive growth, Shri Naidu said that institutionalization of project management was one of the important lessons that government agencies must learn from the private sector.

Expressing his concern over delays in execution of projects on time, the Vice President said that this trend needed to change and called upon Project Managers to act as change agents to improve the execution of projects and programmes.

Referring to the recommendation of Task Force on Project and Programme Management which called for prescription of global standards and certifications for project professionals in public projects, Shri Naidu said ""We need to improve the way we plan projects, manage stakeholders, monitor progress, take corrective action swiftly and decisively and develop future-ready talent with a high technology quotient"".

Tasking Project Manages to acquire the right skills and keep constantly attuned to the demands of the future, Shri Naidu said that it was their opportunity to contribute to the industry and the country as the successful implementation of each project within time and budget, benefits hundreds, thousands and sometimes millions of people.

Referring to the policy framework initiated by the Quality Council of India, Shri Naidu said that it would pave way for a formal approach to project and programme management once it receives a go-ahead from the government.

The Vice President also stressed the need for the conservation of water and ending single-use plastic.

The Vice President also released a Book on Project Management in Braille facilitated by Ms. Neha Agarwal who is a visually impaired Chapter.

The PMI Board of Directors, Mr. Joseph Cahill, the Chair, PMI Board of Directors, Mr. Randall T Black, the Conference Chairman, Shri S.G. Sriram, the Conference Director, Smt. Komal Mathur, the General Secretary, PMI Pearl City Chapter, Hyderabad, Shri Bhaskar Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""Let me begin by congratulating Project Management Institute (PMI), India for organizing this mega-conference. I am also happy to be in Hyderabad, a city of happening and a city that has a special place in my heart.

Our country has seen big shifts in the past five years in terms of economic progress, infrastructure development, market confidence and social empowerment.

Under the able leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, we are on a mission to “reform, perform and transform”. The aim is to transform the lives of the people and the country at large.

I am happy to note that the theme of this conference is “Adapt, Transform, Accelerate, Made Possible by a Project Manager”. 

Project managers are extremely important for a nation’s progress -- whether it is to plan and execute projects well, be change leaders, or inspire people from different geographical locations, cultures, and ethnicities to work together for the common good.

Project managers have played a vital role in both public and private sectors - from infrastructure building to IT, from telecom to the power sector to healthcare and more.

However, to support fast growth across sectors, the country requires more skilled talent.

It has been estimated that by 2027, India will need 70 lakh new project managers.

So, let me assure you that you are in the right place at the right time.

This is your opportunity to contribute to your industry and your country - because for each project implemented successfully, within time and budget, there are hundreds, thousands, and sometimes millions of people who stand to benefit.

Sadly our country does not have a good track record of executing projects on time. This needs to change. Although transformation must be seen at all levels, the project managers play a key role and must act as change agents.

The flash report that the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation published in April this year says that more than 25% of large central sector projects (that cost Rs. 150 crore or more) are delayed beyond their scheduled date of completion.

We need to improve the execution of our projects and programs. For that, we need to improve the way we plan projects, manage stakeholders, monitor progress, take corrective action swiftly and decisively, and develop future-ready talent with a high technology quotient.

PMI India is part of a Task Force on Project and Program Management set up by NITI Aayog.

The task force has recommended the setting up of a ‘National Policy Framework for Project and Program Management’, and prescribed global standards and certifications for project professionals in public projects.

The Quality Council of India is currently working on the policy framework. If implemented, it would be the first time that the Government of India would have initiated a formal approach to project and program management.

I believe this is the right time for such a step. Our country has embarked on a development agenda that is bold, ambitious, and at a pace and scale that is unprecedented.

India is a land of engineering and architectural wonders that serve as examples of great project management practices, from the ancient temples of Mahabalipuram to the Ashoka Pillar that is a miracle even today among metallurgists because of its rust-resistant quality.

Modern-day India has had several remarkable achievements that serve as proof of our capabilities.

The newly inaugurated Statue of Unity on the banks of the Narmada, in Kevadia in Gujarat is an example.

Not only did we build the tallest statue in the world – at 597 feet - but we also built it in a record time of 33 months.

There are many other projects and programs that are a matter of great pride for us - Aadhar, the world’s largest biometric database; Chandrayaan 1 and 2 that have placed us among the best in the world of space research; Indian elections, which is the largest democratic exercise in the world; and the Kumbh Mela, which is the largest human gathering in the world.

I have had the privilege of heading two ministries that are responsible for some of the largest and most complex projects and programs that the country has seen of late – the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

In the next few minutes, let me talk about some of the biggest successes that we have seen in recent years, the challenges that we have faced and the lessons that we have learned from them.

As the Minister of Rural Development during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, I launched the Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana in 2000 to improve rural connectivity, with a mission to bring unconnected and isolated villages of the country into the road network.

So far, the ministry has built more than 6 lakh km of rural roads under this program. 

Many of these villages are in remote corners of the country and have a population of less than 500.

As the Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, I was privileged to have overseen the rollout of some of the most ambitious programs of the government - Swachh Bharat, Smart Cities, Housing and Prime Minister’s Awas Yojna.

We have made good progress towards achieving Gandhiji’s vision of a clean India, a pledge that Prime Minister Modi had made on October 2, 2014. In a few days when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we would have fulfilled that promise to a large extent.

Since October 2014, 699 districts and over 4300 cities across the country have been declared ODF. 

This is remarkable progress, but Swachh Bharat is much more than just building toilets. It is about changing people’s habits and breaking customs that are deep-rooted.

So the big project management challenge here is to change people’s perceptions and win their support for lasting impact.

Smart Cities is another ambitious programme that has few parallels in the world.

 

According to the World Urbanisation Prospects, the urban population in the year 2025 will rise to 42.5 percent (566 million).

Smart Cities will provide the answer to many of the problems that our growing cities face today - like public transport, water management, solid waste management and crime prevention.

To me the big challenge here is not funding or infrastructure or technology but leadership. Where the state or the city has strong, visionary leaders, Smart City projects have moved ahead well.

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is among the biggest successes of the government. We have over-achieved our targets - our original target was 7.5 crore new bank accounts, which was revised to 12.54 crore. 

The government has achieved 100 percent of that target - of which 60 percent accounts are in rural areas and 51 percent of account holders are women. 

The project management lesson that one can draw from this is that bold initiatives need champions who will inspire the team to work towards achieving bigger goals.

In this case, the Prime Minister championed this greatest financial inclusion program in the world.

Let me move to another inspiring initiative.

Difficulty in land acquisition has been one of the major reasons for highway projects lagging behind schedule.

We have found a good solution for that - we don’t award a highway contract unless 80 percent of the land is acquired. As a result, of the 700 ongoing national highway projects in India, over 40 percent have been completed in the past four years.

The project management lesson to learn from this – innovative thinking and the will to make it happen go a long way in overcoming difficulties.

We had made a promise to connect every village of India to the electricity grid, and today I am happy to say that we have achieved 100 percent of that target.

The biggest lesson here is the coordinated effort between the central and state governments, district administrations and village panchayats, and power distribution companies to translate a promise into reality.

Exposure to fumes during cooking has increased the incidence of respiratory diseases among rural citizens and the urban poor, especially women.

Through the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, now 7 crore poor households have received free LPG stoves and initial refills.

There are two other areas that need urgent attention in the country and the Prime Minister has rightfully flagged those issues – access to clean water and saving the country from plastic.

Another major project that is being undertaken by the government is the provision of piped water to all homes across India by 2024.

 

In many of the successes that our the country has achieved, there is a strong role of the private sector.

I believe the private sector can play an even bigger role in nation-building. Whether it’s smart cities, education, healthcare or infrastructure building, I believe public-private partnerships will be the order of the day.

One of the important lessons that government agencies must learn from the private sector is to institutionalize project management.

Many organizations flourish because of a leader but once the leader is gone, they go back to their old ways of working.

Yes, we need heroes who will inspire us and drive us to achieve big things. But we also need to establish systems and processes that will ensure that an organization functions well whether the hero is there or not. That will be crucial in the days ahead.

I believe that project managers carry a huge responsibility. These are times of immense changes and your knowledge and skills will be crucial in helping organizations grow, which in turn will have a positive impact on the industry and the country’s economy.

My message to you is two-fold: acquire the right skills and keep yourself constantly attuned to the demands of the future.

Technology is changing fast and you need to be aware of the latest digital skills to stay relevant in your job. However, only technical skills will not help you grow. Develop leadership skills and business knowledge to compete with the best in the world.

Secondly, there is a lot that you can do in your individual capacity for your community.

I am extremely happy to hear about PMI’s Global Celebration of Service in commemoration of its 50th anniversary.

I commend PMI for its pledge to dedicate 100,000 hours of service to the community.

This is a great opportunity for project managers to give back to society. So go ahead and commit yourself to a cause that you believe in.

I once again congratulate the members of PMI Pearl City Chapter and wish PMI all the best for its professional development and community-building initiatives.

Thank you!

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called upon people to learn as many languages as possible and asserted that there should not be imposition of any language, nor should there be opposition to any particular language.

Interacting with students from Sharada Residential School, who had returned recently after visiting NASA and other places in the United States of America, Shri Naidu stressed that India was blessed with many languages and asked students and teachers to give importance to promoting mother tongue, while learning other languages.

Describing travelling as a form of education and good learning experience, the Vice President advised the students to visit all the major tourist places within India to get acquainted with various facets of India’s culture, heritage, languages and cuisine and enhance their understanding of India’s unique cultural mosaic. “Before going out, look with in and enhance your knowledge,” he added.

Referring to the call given by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi asking people to visit 15 tourist places in India by 2022 to give a boost to the domestic tourism, Shri Naidu advised them to visit historic, spiritual, scenic tourist places in India and explore the cultural heritage of India. “Such visits will enhance your knowledge and give you an insight into our past,” he said.

Asking children to spend time in the lap of nature, the Vice President wanted them to take active part in protecting and preserving the nature and culture. He also called upon them to take a pledge to stop using single-use plastics from October 2 as suggested by the Prime Minister.

The Vice President called for revamping the education system and said that it must make students to enjoy schooling. “Revamping the curriculum is needed to focus on aspects that make a child curious, creative, caring, communicative, confident and capable,” he added.

The Vice President also suggested that the new education policy must focus more on Indian history and cover the contributions made by freedom fighters from different parts of the country. “There are many great stalwarts, who were in the forefront of the fight against the colonial rule. Our children must learn about them,” he said.

Stressing the need to allocate 50 percent of schooling hours outside classrooms to enhance physical fitness of the students, Shri Naidu cautioned the students about the growing incidences of non-communicable diseases due to unhealthy lifestyle practices and food habits.

Shri Naidu advised them to shun junk food and adopt healthy dietary habits as the Indian food was time tested and prescribed according to the seasons and regions.

He advised school administrations to encourage students to take part in voluntary services such as NSS, NCC, Scouts and Guides as they instil the spirit of volunteerism and service in them.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon people, particularly the youth to visit various tourist destinations in the country to get acquainted with various facets of India’s culture, heritage, languages and cuisine and enhance their understanding of its unique cultural mosaic.

 

Speaking after releasing the book ‘Himalayan Odyssey’, the English translation of the award-winning Malayalam original - ‘Haimavathabhuvil’, written by Shri M.P. Veerendra Kumar, Member of Parliament and Chief Managing Director of Mathrubhumi, in New Delhi today, he said that the diverse nature of various places of interest in the country, which are steeped in history, culture, mythology and heritage, provide immense opportunity to leverage the tourism potential. “One should know their country better before exploring the world”, he added. 

 

Observing that every state has unique tourist destinations, the Vice President said “certain places give you inspiration, new thoughts and new ideas”. He wanted the youth to spend time in the lap of nature and strive to protect it. Voicing concern that the nature was showing its fury after it has been exploited by human beings for decades, he wanted people to love and live with nature. “Protect Nature and preserve culture for a better future”, he added. 

 

The Vice President also called upon corporate bodies like CII, FICCI and ASSOCHAM to identify tourist places that are less developed and fund their development and beautification. He wanted them to supplement the efforts of Central and State Governments in making India an attractive global tourist destination.

 

Shri Naidu said that wherever possible Public-Private Partnership models must be adopted to take necessary steps to give a boost to domestic tourism. 

 

Describing tourism sector as a major engine for economic growth and for creation of employment in sectors like hospitality, transport and as a means for empowering local communities, Shri Naidu opined that there was is a great scope and need to develop tourist circuits on specific themes to attract the tourists having special interests in visiting such places. 

 

Referring to the call given by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, asking people to visit 15 new tourist places by 2022 to support domestic tourism, the Vice President urged students to undertake Bharat Dashan to understand the challenges faced by the nation and to device ingenious solutions to counter these problems.

 

Shri Naidu complimented the government for introducing schemes such as Swadesh Darshan, National Mission for Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD) and applauded the Railway Ministry for launching special pilgrimage packages to give a boost to domestic tourism.

 


	about the book, Shri Naidu said that with the core theme of various journeys made to the Himalayan Char Dhams, it takes in its grand sweep everything from the snow-capped Himalayan peaks to the banks of the river Nila in Kerala. 


 

The Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Shri Harivansh, the Member of Parliament, Shri Jayaram Ramesh, Shri D. Raja and others were present on the occasion. 

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

 

“I am extremely pleased to release ‘Himalayan Odyssey’, the English translation of the Malayalam original--Haimavathabhuvil.

I am glad that the book first published in Malayalam by Mathrubhumi Books has won the coveted Kendra Sahitya Akademi and Kerala Sahitya Akademi awards. The other honours include Moorthidevi Puraskar, Dr. Shivram Karanth award, Vayalar award and Amrita Keerthi Puraskaram.

 

The English version of the travelogue captures the grandeur, the civilizational ethos and culture of India in all its glory and I must compliment Shri Veerendra Kumar for the excellent work. 

 

Indeed, the book is about India’s legends, mythologies, history, geography, culture, arts, spirituality and politics, capturing the fecund diversity of Indian civilization.

 

With the core theme of various journeys made to the Himalayan Char Dhams, the book takes in its grand sweep everything from the snow-capped Himalayan peaks to the banks of the river Nila in Kerala.

 

The book talks of the spiritual evolution of our heritage from the Himalaya deva-bhumi to the veda-bhumi of the banks of Nila; Meditation on Krishna, the subtle concepts of Radhakrishna and Raslila and their deep-rooted hold on the native imagination and the poetic charm of Gita Govinda by Jayadeva. 

 

Beginning with the author’s journey to the Himalayas from Delhi in October 2003, it recounts his long association with the capital and talks of the mythical origins of Indraprastha and the hoary legend of Kurukshetra.

 

Tracing the historic events that unfolded on the banks of the Yamuna from the times of the Delhi Sultanate to the making of imperial Lutyens Delhi, it touches on the Hindu-Mughal-Islamic, Buddhist and Jain influences on the eclectic architecture. 

 

Among others, the writer mentions the landmark Stockholm convention in the context of pollution in the city of Ghaziabad and Meerut’s historic link to Alexander, its mythological links to the Mahabharatha and its role in the First War of Indian Independence.

 

After delving into the contributions of philosopher-poet-grammarian Bhartrihari, the work turns philosophical.

 

The hallowed land of Kankhal, the concept of Ardhanareeshwara, the Haridwar declaration to ‘Save Ganga’ in 2002 in the context of Tehri dam displacement, the earlier efforts by Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, and references to the various holy temples in the region are also found in the book.

 

The book also talks of the sacred Ganges with its perennial hold on the Indian imagination with poets, scientists and travelers lauding its mystical qualities. Apart from mentioning about Gangotri, the author refers to the retreat of the Gomukh glacier. Sounding an environmental alert, he also quoted many scientific studies on global warming.

 

The history of Tehri Garhwal, global ecological impact of massive dams, the origins of music, through Tansen to the little known musical bent of Swami Vivekananda, the sacred nature of Kedarnath, with its centrality to Shaivaite faith and the journey to the holy dham of Kedarnath are all interestingly penned by the author.

 

The book also talks of the eventful Kailash-trek of the head monk of Vasishtguha, the architectural marvel of the Baijnath temple dating back to the Katyuri dynasty on the banks of the Gomti River and ruminates on the concept of Devi as the high point of the feminine principle.

 

The final chapter is a summation on the journey through both space and time undertaken with a band of near and dear ones, with Kausani, home town to nationalist poet Sumitranandan Pant, and Anashakti Ashram triggering a wave of thoughts on Gandhian philosophy and its abiding relevance for all times.

 

Finally, I would like to stress the importance of promoting both domestic and international tourism and bringing out more travel books on India. 

 

Dear friends, 

 

From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, India has many scenic and pilgrimage destinations with relevance to Indian history, culture, mythology and heritage. 

 

There is a great scope and need to develop tourist circuits on specific themes to attract the tourists having special interest in visiting such places. 

 

Tourism is a major engine for economic growth and for creation of employment in sectors like hospitality, transport and empowers local communities.  

 

While the central and state governments are doing their bit to develop tourist spots and promote tourism, I would like to suggest to the corporate sector to supplement the efforts of the governments.

 

I compliment the government for introducing schemes such as Swadesh Darshan, National Mission for Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD) and also the Railway Ministry for launching special pilgrimage packages. 

 

I feel that as suggested by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, people, especially the youth must visit at least 15 tourist destinations within India by 2022 to give boost to domestic tourism.

 

Undertaking Bharat Dashan by students would be a good learning experience for them on various facets of India’s culture, heritage, languages and cuisine and enhance their understanding of the unique cultural mosaic of the country.

 

As a matter-of-fact, the corporate bodies like CII, FICCI and Assocham should identify tourism places which are less developed and fund their development and beautification. From pilgrim tourism to adventure tourism; from eco-tourism to wellness tourism, incredible India has plenty to offer. Wherever possible, PPP model should be implemented to make India one of the most attractive global tourist destinations. 

 

I would like to once again compliment Shri M P Veerendra Kumar for penning this fascinating book. He is a multifaceted personality and wears many hats. A former Union Minister, who had served in the cabinets of Shri H D Deve Gowda and Shri I K Gujral, he is a prolific writer and authored several books. 

 

I am told that he was conferred more than 100 awards, including the Kendra and Kerala Sahitya Akademi Awards and the moortidevi award instituted by the Bharatiya Jnanpith. As Chairman and Managing Director of the Mathrubhumi Printing and Publishing Company Limited, he has made immense contribution to the field of journalism.

 

Thank you!

 

Jaihind!!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon students, teachers and all educational institutions to build a people’s movement for water conservation and against the single-use plastics.

Addressing a group of students who secured top ranks in the Uttarakhand 10th Board Examinations, he referred to Swachh Bharat, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Per Drop More Crop, Poshan Abhiyaan and Yoga and said that they should be turned into people’s movements. He said Uttarakhand has been blessed with water and forest resources and it was the pious duty of the people to conserve these resources.

Emphasizing on water conservation, Shri Naidu described water as Mother Earth’s nectar.  At a time when we are looking for traces of water in search of life on the moon, we should give greater importance to conserving water on earth.

Referring to the many-splendored scenic spots in Uttarakhand, he said that there was huge potential to promote tourism, particularly pilgrimage tourism in the state as it would also create job opportunities for locals.  

The Vice President recalled the statement of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi urging people to explore 15 new domestic tourism destinations by 2022 and said that travelling itself was part of the learning process for the students as it would expose them to cultural diversity and unity of the country.  

Pointing out that technology was changing at a rapid pace the Vice President urged the students to keep abreast of the latest technological developments and strive to build a New India.

Shri Naidu complimented the students for their achievements.

The students were accompanied by the local MLA from Deoprayag, Uttarakhand, Shri Vinod Khandari.

The Vice President was informed that the MLA Shri Vinod Khandari has organised Bharat Darshan for meritorious students form 51 Government Schools in Uttarakhand.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has advised the Union Minister for Science and Technology, Shri Harsh Vardhan to expedite the setting up of a new research facility of National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) at Thupilipallam village in Nellore District of Andhra Pradesh.

The Vice President, while enquiring about the development projects in Andhra Pradesh, noted that the process for setting up the research facility was moving at snail’s pace due to legal hurdles. He immediately spoke to the Union Minister, Shri Harsh Vardhan.

Subsequently, the Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Dr. M. Rajeevan and the Advisor, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Dr. M.P. Wakdikar called on the Vice President and briefed him on the status of the project, here today.

The officials informed the Vice President that while 97.37 acres was acquired for the proposed facility, the process got delayed due to litigation pertaining to a portion of the land. The Vice President also spoke to the Collector, Nellore District and asked him to have the legal issues resolved at the earliest. He also wanted the Ministry of Earth Sciences to quicken the process for establishing the facility.

The foundation stone for the Rs.250 crore state-of-the-art seafront facility was laid on April 25, 2016 by Shri Harsh Vardhan as the Union Minister for Science and Technology in the presence of Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu when he was the Union Minister for Urban Development and the then Chief Minister, Shri N. Chandrababu Naidu.

The proposed facility envisages real time prototype testing, calibration, trials and demonstration of ocean technological activities at sea, development of prototype systems, validation of indigenously developed marine systems in the ocean, including establishment of laboratory and testing facilities on the seashore.

A long-term master plan has also been prepared considering the long-term development of test facilities.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for the expansion of Supreme Court and the establishment of more benches in different parts of the country, as per the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice, to put an end to the inconvenience caused to litigants who travel long distances and spend a huge amount of money and energy to access justice. Saying that Election petitions and criminal cases against political leaders must be decided quickly by special benches of higher courts in a time-bound manner, Shri Naidu called for setting up of separate benches to expedite such cases within six months or one year.

Shri Naidu also called upon the three limbs of the state, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary to work together and inspire synergy to ensure all-round development of the nation. He opined that these organs of the state perform their duties best when they don’t transgress into each other’s territory.

Speaking after launching the book ‘Rethinking Good Governance’, authored by the former Comptroller Auditor General (CAG), Shri Vinod Rai, in New Delhi today, the Vice President said that decentralization of powers and responsibilities to local bodies must be implemented more efficiently and asserted that funds, functions, and functionaries must be transferred to these institutions. “This will bring governance closer to people and enhance its credibility and effectiveness,” he added

Opining that the welfare of the common man must be the enduring theme of our vision for transforming India, Shri Naidu said that it was the pious responsibility of all to ensure that the fruits of democratic good governance reaches everyone, especially the ones who are at the farthest end of the development spectrum.

Stating that India was surging forward, fuelled by its vibrant economy and aided by a stable and progressive government, Shri Naidu stressed that India’s far-reaching and path-breaking reforms must be further accelerated by citizen-centric, technology-oriented, robust, transparent, responsive, flexible and adaptable good governance practices.

Pointing out that the three important functions of legislatures were legislative, deliberative and accountability, the Vice President said that while some legislative bodies were functioning well, in many of them, there was certainly considerable room for improvement.

Saying that the constitution has vested the Parliament with sufficient instruments through which it could enforce accountability of the government, Shri Naidu said that the efficacy of these instruments could only be as good as the Parliamentarians and political parties who deploy them.

Observing that the role played by an effective opposition in a Parliamentary democracy could never be undermined, Shri Nadu said that it was up to the opposition to hold the government to account and to provide constructive criticisms and meaningful interventions in the legislative process as and when necessary. “Disrupting proceeding of the house is not the way forward,” he added.

Saying that today’s enlightened citizenry, especially the youth was watching actions of Parliamentarians very closely and questioning their actions, motives, and attitudes within and outside the House, Shri Naidu asked Parliamentarians to always be mindful and respectful of the aspirations of the common man and advised them to carry on with rectitude and propriety, serving as model citizens of the country.

“We need legislators who are well informed and well intentioned and capable of articulating a well-presented viewpoint, not those who are eager to rush to the well of the House,” he said.

The Vice President asked political parties to adopt a code of conduct for their legislators and contribute to policymaking through informed decisions. He wanted Political parties to carefully choose candidates based upon their capacity, calibre, and good conduct and said that they must rise above the narrow considerations of caste and religion that seek to divide the society.

Calling for the need to constantly evaluate governance strategies and its outcomes, Shri Naidu advised policymakers to be flexible and open enough to bring about course corrections whenever necessary.

He wanted them to accord priority to the quality of service delivery on all programs and schemes and ensure that the intended benefits of a programme must reach the people in time.

Expressing concern over the heavy pendency of cases in various courts in the country, the Vice President suggested reforming the system to eliminate judicial delays and also to improve its efficiency. 

Pointing that a number of civil and criminal cases have been pending for over 25 years, the Vice President  said that there was a need for division of the Supreme Court into a Constitution Bench at Delhi and Cassation benches in four regions - Delhi, Chennai / Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai, as suggested the Law Commission

Expressing his agreement with the suggestions made by the Chief Justice of India to improve the functioning of the judiciary, he said that increasing the retirement age of high court judges and making tenure appointments to clear the backlog were pragmatic solutions.

Along with the author of the book, Shri Vinod Rai, Prof.  C. Raja Mohan, the Director, Institute of South Asian Studies, Singapore, Shri Shakti Sinha, Director, Nehru Memorial Museum & Library and Shri Kapish Mehra, Managing Director, Rupa Publications India were also present at the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It gives me great pleasure to release Shri Vinod Rai’s book, Rethinking Good Governance, an important and timely analysis of India’s public institutions that reflect our national character.

I congratulate Shri Rai for presenting his profound insights on various institutions in a brilliantly lucid, keenly observant, steadfastly honest and finely balanced manner.

The book offers a scholarly analysis of the country’s key accountability agencies whose functions underpin and affect all facets of life in India.

Shri Rai has rightly pointed out that the vital bond between people and the government is that of trust and that public institutions are the custodians of that trust.

Shri Rai begins by making a profound statement.

He says that ‘accountability institutions script the destiny of nations’. I tend to agree with this statement.

Accountability institutions support good governance which promotes sustainable development and welfare of the people. It has also been proven beyond doubt that economic development efforts cannot be sustained over time without good governance platforms that can foster and nurture them.

He emphasizes upon the need for Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) to shift from the conventional audit of public expenditure to public accountability and calls upon the civil service to be more professional and responsive.

Through his astute commentary presented in the book, Shri Rai focused on institutions such as the Parliament, the Supreme Court, Election Commission, Comptroller and Auditor General, Central Vigilance Commission and the Central Information Commission, among others.

Leveraging his long and distinguished innings in public life, he has done a commendable job of proposing a reform agenda, suggesting how the credibility of these institutions,once eroded, can be restored.

My dear sisters and brothers,

Today, India is surging forward, fuelled by its vibrant economy, supported by its scientific and technological progress, aided and abetted by the energy of its burgeoning youth population and helmed by a stable and progressive government.

The Prime Minister’s zeal for reforms, reflected in his mantra of “Reform Perform and Transform”, has given a new impetus to the transformational development of our country.

Today we dream of being a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25.

Reaching this lucrative goal would call for nothing short of the combined and united efforts of the government, the public institutions and the civil society.

The far-reaching and path breaking reforms must be further accelerated through citizen- centric, technology-oriented, robust, transparent, responsive, flexible and adaptable good governance practices.

As we step into the 73rd year of independence, it is crucial that we ponder on the current situation of our three state organs– the legislature, the executive and the judiciary–and see how we can further strengthen these three pillars.

Throughout my long and rewarding career as a Parliamentarian, I have always maintained that parliamentary democracy is all about ensuring governance through accountability to the people.

In fact, the three important functions of legislatures are legislative, deliberative and accountability.

While some legislative bodies are functioning well, in many of them, there is certainly considerable room for improvement. 

The constitution has vested the Parliament with sufficient instruments through which it can enforce accountability of the government. However, efficacy of these instruments can only be as good as the parliamentarians and political parties who deploy them.

The role played by an effective opposition in a Parliamentary democracy can never be undermined.

It is up to the opposition to hold the government to account and to provide constructive criticisms and meaningful interventions in the legislative process as and when necessary.

Disrupting proceeding of the house is not the way forward.

Shri Rai points out in the book that during the 11th Lok Sabha (1996-97), barely 5.2% of the time was lost due to disruptions but in the 13th Lok Sabha (1994-2004), 18.9% of the time was lost and that figure rose to 19.6% in the 14th Lok Sabha (2004-2009).

The 15th Lok Sabha saw an appalling 39% of its time lost to disruptions. This is a truly distressing trend and must not be allowed to continue under any circumstance.

As I have repeatedly emphasized in my public speeches, I would like legislators across the country to ‘discuss, debate and decide’ not ‘disrupt’.

We must realize that today’s enlightened citizenry, especially the youth, are watching actions of Parliamentarians very closely and questioning their actions, motives and attitudes not only within the House but outside as well.

Parliamentarians must always be mindful and respectful of the aspirations of the common man and carry on with rectitude and propriety, serving as model citizens of the country.

There is also general perception that the quality of debates in Parliament has been declining. We need legislators who are well informed and well intentioned and capable of articulating a well presented viewpoint, not those who are eager to rush to the well of the House.

I also hope that all political parties will adopt a code of conduct for their legislators and contribute to policy making through informed decisions.

Political parties must also very carefully choose candidates based upon their capacity, calibre and good conduct and rise above the narrow considerations of caste and religion that seek to divide the society.

It is indeed a matter of great concern that the Inter-Parliamentary Union ranked Indian 153 out of 190 nations in the proportion of women in Parliament. We must take special care to ensure that the parliament is a truly representational body and give more prominence to increasing the number of women parliamentarians and parliamentarians from other marginalized sections.

My dear sisters and brothers,

India is undergoing a rapid transformation.

A number of progressive policy interventions, legislations and programs from ‘Beti Baachao Beti Padao’ to the implementation of ‘Goods and Services tax’, from the striking down of ‘Triple Talaq’ to the implementation of ‘Ayushman Bharat’, touted to be the world’s largest free healthcare scheme, India is undergoing a 360-degree transformation.

Visionary programs such as ‘Swachh Bharat’, ‘Make-in-India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Start-up India’, ‘Skill India’ has put India on a path of rapid reforms.

All these initiatives will give results only when they are built on strong foundations of a robust governance system.

Making laws and policies is only a part of the story. Implementing and executing them is a more crucial aspect of governance.

Designing programmes intelligently, funding them sustainably, monitoring their implementation consistently and evaluating their outcomes scientifically is the crux of good governance.

We need to constantly evaluate our governance strategies and its outcomes and be flexible and open enough to bring about course corrections whenever necessary.

There should be no gap between policy intent and policy implementation. The intended benefits of a programme must reach the people in time. The quality of service delivery is an area that needs more attention than what is being done today.

We must ensure that the fruits of democratic good governance reach everyone, especially the ones who are at the farthest end of the development spectrum.

Results based management should become the norm.

One way to make the delivery of services more efficient is through the use of digital technologies. India has embarked upon an ambitious ‘Digital India’ mission, intended to drive governance and the delivery of services online, thereby eliminating middle men and infusing greater transparency and accountability in our systems.

I have also observed that government programmes tend to succeed when people get enthused and participate in the implementation of programmes. 

I strongly believe that decentralization of powers and responsibility to local bodies needs to be more efficiently implemented as per the Constitutional provisions. 

Funds, functions and functionaries must be transferred to these institutions. 

This will bring governance closer to people and enhance its credibility and effectiveness.

My dear sisters and brothers,

It is not only the legislature and the executive that should become more accountable to people. 

The judicial processes too must become more people-friendly.

Only an efficient, transparent, accessible and affordable judicial system can become a key touchstone of good governance, which can improve ease of doing business as well as ease of living.

Over the years, a number of reforms have made our judicial system more robust and responsive. But we have a long way to go.

The Chief Justice of India has recently talked about heavy pendency of cases in various courts. Apparently, there are nearly 60,000 cases pending in the Supreme Court and nearly 44 lakh cases in the High Courts. There is truth in the dictum that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’.

Therefore, the most urgent judicial reform necessary is the elimination of judicial delays and the improvement of the efficiency of the justice system.

The government needs to be much more proactive in addressing the large number of pending vacancies in the judicial system so that delays are avoided.

As regards election cases pending before various courts, they need to be disposed of expeditiously.

Election petitions and criminal cases against political leaders must be decided quickly by special benches of higher courts in a time-bound manner. If need be, separate benches may be setup to expedite such cases within six months or one year.

Similarly, the presiding officers of legislative bodies need to decide anti-defection cases within three months time.

It is heartening that the government has enhanced the number of judges in the Supreme Court by 10% but I am afraid it may be still inadequate.

We also need to bring the judicial system closer to people.

Expanding the Supreme Court bench and having separate benches in different regions on trial basis has been suggested by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice.

I tend to agree with this recommendation.

I think it is high time we had more benches because in a country as vast as India the litigants have to travel long distances and spend a huge amount of money and energy.

There is also a need to improve court management and infrastructure facilities, especially in lower courts.

The endless possibilities of Information Technology may be leveraged to facilitate e-filing and online case management.

A number of civil and criminal cases have been pending for over 25 years. 

This makes me think that we need to not only expand the Supreme Court but also divide the work into Constitutional Division and a number of legal divisions or Courts of Appeal.

As the Law Commission has suggested, there is a need for division of the Supreme Court into a Constitution Bench at Delhi and Cassation benches in four regions—Delhi, Chennai/Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai.

As regards the need for division of the Apex Court in four regions, Article 130 of the constitution states: “The Supreme Court shall sit in Delhi or in such other place or places, as the Chief Justice of India may, with the approval of the President, from time to time, appoint”.

The suggestions of the Chief Justice of India to raise the retirement age of high court judges and make tenure appointments to clear the backlog seem to be pragmatic solutions in the current context.

My dear sisters and brothers,

It is clear that there must be a synergy in the working of the three limbs of the state, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.

But the three organs of the state perform their duties well when they do not transgress into each other’s territory.

The welfare of the common man must be the enduring theme of our vision for transforming India. Let me remind you of the Talisman given to us by the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi.

He said and I quote. “Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore him to a control over his own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj for the hungry and spiritually starving millions? Then you will find your doubts and yourself melt away.""

The issues raised in Rethinking Good Governance about the most important institutions that sustain and nourish our democracy are indeed noteworthy and deserve to be discussed widely.

I would like to place on record my appreciation for the publisher Rupa Publications India, and in particular Mr Kapish Mehra, for bringing out such a worthy publication.

I once again congratulate Shri Vinod Rai for raising issues of national importance.

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today said that people have to be made equal partners in the development process for any democracy to be successful.  

Interacting with the officers of 2017 batch of Indian Administrative Services in New Delhi today, Shri Naidu called for streamlining service delivery by providing people-centric, transparent and effective governance at all levels. He also stressed upon the need to eliminate unnecessary rules and regulations and to simplify processes.

He asked the officers to interact with people on a regular basis and to be receptive to their problems. Urging officers to spend a lion’s share of their time in the field, the Vice President said that real education comes from the field.

Shri Naidu asked Civil Services Officers to take lead in translating “Swarajya” to “Surajya” by providing a corruption-free, citizen-centric and business-friendly governance and ensure that fruits of development reach each citizen to cause a perceptible improvement in the quality of life. 

Observing that the Government of India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had initiated several path-breaking administrative and governance reforms, the Vice President advised bureaucrats to ensure that legislative intent was translated into effective implementation.

He asked them to make full use of information technology to reach out to the intended beneficiaries and see to it that schemes and programmes of the government reach the common man without any hassle.

Describing civil services officers as the steel frame that bridges the social, cultural, linguistic, religious and economic differences in the country, Shri Naidu said that it was the brainchild of Shri Sardar Patel who foresaw the importance of a competent higher civil service.

Quoting Sardar Patel he said: “You will not have a united India if you do not have a good All-India Service which has the independence to speak out its mind.”

The Vice President asked officers to adopt a more empathetic, responsive and inclusive approach and urged them to take the effort to understand the problems faced by the common man.

He also asked them to make transparency and accountability their guiding principles at all times to serve all sections in society without any discrimination in the spirit of the principle “Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikaas and  Sab Ka Vishwas ”.

Stating that an inclusive and rapid economic development would solve a number of the problems faced by the nation, the Vice President said that it was necessary to ensure that terrorism, communal-violence, insurgency and Maoist extremism do not derail the processes of social and economic development of our country.

Observing that improving the lives of farmers, and those living in rural areas must become the priority, he wanted officers to ensure that the rural population had a say in all aspects of governance. 

He asked officers to seek people’s participation in movements such as Swachh Bharat, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Fit India and others and convert them into people’s movements. He also asked them to place special focus on Agriculture and rural areas and to develop a pronounced bias towards them while designing policies.

Dr. C. Chandramouli, Secretary, DoPT, Shri K. Srinivas, Addl. Secretary, DoPT and others were present at the occasion.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asserted that the dilution of Article 370 would accelerate the process of development in the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh by paving the way for extension of various schemes and legislations, including 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments to strengthen the funds and functions of local bodies.

Interacting with a delegation of a Sarpanches (Village Heads) and Panches (Panchayat Members) from Jammu and Kashmir, in New Delhi today, the Vice President pointed out that Article 370 was only a temporary and transitory provision in the Constitution.

Referring to holding of Panchayat elections under the Governors rule in J&K after a long gap, Shri Naidu expressed his happiness that 74% of the electorate voted and that around 3,500 of the 4,483 Panchayats have been elected.

The Vice President said that with dilution of Article 370 the Panchayats would now become more dynamic as the 3Fs - Funds, Functions & Functionaries would be devolved to them. ‘The financial power of Panchayats has also been increased by 10 times enhancing their financial powers up to Rs one lakh,’ he said.

In addition, the Vice President pointed out that the Panchayats were vested with powers to raise their own resources by increasing taxes. “The Panchayats are also now empowered to conduct audit of schemes like ICDS and PMAY to improve the quality of delivery,” he added.

Observing that greater devolution of funds, functions and functionaries would enable 3-tier administrative system to function more effectively, he said that J&K was losing around 4000 Crores for not conducting Panachayat elections as per the norms set by the 14th Finance Commission. “Now that elections have been conducted, the funds recommended by the Finance Commission will start flowing. I am happy to know that 500 crores have already been released and another 3,000 crores will be released shortly. This will be a big game-changer for Panchayat system,” he added.

The Vice President also suggested that holding elections to local bodies every five years should be made mandatory. “There should be no discretion or scope for the States to either postpone or advance them,” he added.

Stating that effective local governance was key for better implementation of development, and welfare initiatives and for better service delivery, he said that the funds allocated to the local bodies should go into the accounts of Panchayats, municipalities and corporations and spent in accordance with the resolutions of the respective bodies.

The Vice President said that talks with Pakistan would be held only on PoK and asserted that the safety, security and integrity of the nation were paramount for every Indian.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that art unites hearts and added that music transcends the conventional boundaries of geography and it enriches the quality of lives of people.

The Vice President, along with his family members, gave audience to a rendition of classical vocals and bhajans by singer Ms. Sooryagayathri, at Uparashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi today.

Speaking after listening to her Carnatic renditions and recital of Hanuman Chalisa, the Vice President said that it was heartening to see the young and talented singer capture the hearts of music lovers across the globe through her singing talent both on stage and on the internet via YouTube and other platforms.

Shri Naidu said that prodigy musicians like Ms. Sooryagayathri have a noteworthy role to play in enriching the rich and varied cultural heritage of India and in taking it to all corners of the world.

Describing her as a role model, the Vice President said that her dedication, curiosity to learn, her sincere efforts to follow the teachings of her Gurus was inspiring. He expressed confidence that many young people would be inspired to join the fascinating world of Indian musical tradition after listening to Sooryagayatri.

Pointing out that the vast repertory of songs in Indian music has been providing continuous nourishment to the mind, heart, and soul, Shri Naidu said that Indian musicians like late Bharat Ratnas Dr. M.S Subbulakshmi, Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan and many others have given the world a rare menu of soul-stirring musical masterpieces and made it popular around the globe.

Appreciating the GMR Varalkshmi foundation for encouraging Indian traditional art forms, Shri Naidu said that there was an urgent need to preserve, protect and promote Indian culture.

Ms. Sooryagayathri, who hails from the village of Purameri in Vadakara, North Kerala received formal training in Carnatic music from Smt. Anandi and Sri Nishanth. Composer and musician Sri Kuldeep M. Pai has been her mentor both musically and spiritually.

Ms. Soorya Gayathri received several accolades including the M.S. Subbulakshmi fellowship in music at a very tender age of 10 from Mumbai Shanmukhananda Sabha, the Trivandram Kalanidhi Sangeeth Rathna award and Samaj Sakthi Award in 2017 along with her Guru Kuldeep M. Pai, from Hariharaputhra Bhajan Samaj Mumbai.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has described India-France Strategic Partnership as an important pillar of India’s foreign policy and said that India and France could act as harbingers of peace and stability.

Interacting with a delegation of French Parliamentarians led by Mrs. Sophie Primas, the Chair, and Senate Standing Committee for Economic Affairs, in New Delhi today, Shri Naidu called for closer cooperation between India and France to promote peace and harmony in the world.

The Vice President said that India always believed in peaceful co-existence with all countries, including its neighbours. “We don’t want anybody to interfere in the internal affairs of our country, nor do we interfere in the affairs of other countries”, he told the delegation.

Observing that India valued its partnership with France on defence cooperation, maritime security, counter-terrorism, space co-operation, economic partnership, and the other areas, the Vice President suggested the setting up of Indo-French Parliamentary Friendship Group to promote closer ties between the two nations. He also expressed happiness over France’s decision to partner with India under the Smart Cities initiatives. India’s development needs require massive investments in urban renewal and clean energy, he added.

Calling for greater trade, technology, and capital flows between the two nations, Shri Naidu said the bilateral trade momentum needs to be multiplied to reach the set target of trade in goods to 15 bn Euros by 2022.

Stating that Climate Change was an article of faith for the Indian government, Vice President reaffirmed India’s commitment to Paris Agreements and said that India was on way to achieve the goals well in advance. He commended France on the initiatives in this regard and in particular, for holding the One Planet Summits.

Shri Naidu also recollected his visit to France during the centenary of World War I Armistice held in November 2018 where he had inaugurated the first Indian War Memorial in Villers Guislain in the memory of more than 9,000 Indians, who sacrificed their lives in that war.

Referring to the longstanding and multifaceted space cooperation between India and France through ISRO and CNES, he said, “We are committed to carrying forward this cooperation”.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon educational institutions across the country to partner in programs such as ‘Fit India’ and ‘Khelo India’ and encourage students to lead a physically active life.

He said that health and physical fitness of the youth were as important as their intellectual and emotional development. It was particularly essential in the wake of the spurt in the non-communicable diseases in the country.  

Speaking at the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of Maharaja Agrasen College, in New Delhi today, the Vice President stressed the need to provide a multidisciplinary and holistic education that includes co-curricular activities and community service.

The Vice President asked the academicians to promote critical thinking, problem-solving, cultural literacy, global outlook, teamwork, ethical reasoning, and social responsibility among the students. 

Advising the authorities to empower the youth by revamping the education system and reorient it to suit the present-day needs, Shri Naidu said that ending the digital divide, improving quality of education and building adequate infrastructure for skill up-gradation of rural youth was essential to realizing India’s demographic dividend.

He stressed the need to boost the employability of the graduates through intensive skilling programs, especially in cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Robotics, etc.

Talking about India’s long and illustrious history of holistic education and the guru Shishya Parampara, the Vice President asserted that the main aim of education was not for employment alone, but to enhance knowledge and provide enlightenment and empowerment to individuals.

Referring to the Draft National Education Policy 2019, the Vice President said that it proposes to focus on the holistic aspect of education and emphasizes that education throughout life was based on four pillars – i) Learning to know -  ii) Learning to do -  iii) Learning to live together –  iv)  Learning to be.

Shri Naidu asked teachers, scholars, professors and all other citizens to provide inputs to strengthen India’s education system and make it relevant to the needs of 21st century.

The former Governor of Gujarat & Madhya Pradesh, Shri O.P. Kohli, the Vice Chancellor of University of Delhi, Prof. Yogesh Tyagi, the Chairman of the Governing Body of Maharaja Agrasen College, Prof. Sunil Sharma and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to be here, amidst bright, talented youngsters of the Maharaja Agrasen College on the occasion of its Silver Jubilee Celebration.

I am told that the 25 year long journey of this institution had humble its beginnings in a temporary campus in Mayur Vihar, Delhi, with few courses and a small team of teaching faculty and administrative staff.  Back then, the college was known as ‘Co-Educational College’.

The college was renamed as ‘Maharaja Agrasen College’ in 1995 in memory of the great philosopher and King, Maharaja Agrasen. The college continued flourishing and celebrating years of imparting holistic education in various creative ways, to reach its current stature.

I congratulate the college for being accredited with 'A' rank by NAAC in 2016 for excellent academic output and all-round achievements. I hope that such accolades will keep motivating you to achieve much better results in future.

I am happy to note that, the college has been continuously upgrading its infrastructure to create conducive learning environment. I understand that the college auditorium was inaugurated in 2014 and named after our great leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

The strong commitment to women’s education that the college possesses is reflected in the construction of a hostel exclusively for girls, aptly named 'Vidyottama', inaugurated in 2015, to provide home away from home to the outstation and needy meritorious girl students.

I applaud the institution for erecting a statue of Maharaja Agrasen, the Indian ruler and philosopher, in 2018. I hope that the statute will constantly remind you of the human, social and moral values upheld by the great king.

I also commend the college for its initiatives to bring about equity in education by extending a helping hand to youngsters from under-privileged sections of the society through motivational and informative workshops, remedial classes, short term language courses, basic computer workshops and many more such successful, encouraging voluntary efforts.

I am also glad to learn that under project ABHI (Agrasen Baroji Help Initiative), the institution has adopted a village 'Baroji' and encourages students to interact regularly with the members of the village community for the mutual development of the college and the village.

The many awards and accolades won by the college for Good Practices are an eloquent testimony to the institution’s   strong commitment to excellence through inclusion.

I congratulate each and every one of you for the important milestone that this institution has achieved today.

My dear young friends,

India is writing a great growth story today, a story that has been recognized and acknowledged by the entire world.

India’s vibrant economy, buoyed by investments, exports and favorable demographics is surging forward, aspiring to become a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024-25 (Economic survey 2019).

Flagship schemes such as the Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, has breathed a new life into India’s quest for inclusive development.

India inc. is stronger than ever before due to visionary initiatives like make-in-India, start-up India and Digital India.

More than 21,000 start-ups have been recognized since the inception of Start-up India and more than 1,20,000 Gram Panchayats have been connected by optical fiber network. 413 Crore financial transactions have happened via the BHIM app since August 2016.

This emphasis on digital technology has effectively tackled corruption and unnecessary delays in processes, transforming our governance, making it much more transparent, participative and fast.

India is also conquering new horizons when it comes to technology. The recently launched Chandrayaan 2 mission has completed all its orbit manoeuvres around the Moon and is ready to land close to the lunar south pole and we are all set to launch India’s first human space mission by 2022. 

India has also rightly recognized that sustainability must form the cornerstone of every development plan. As a testament to the love and respect for nature that is at the core of India’s civilizational philosophy, we have doubled our efforts towards securing clean energy and ensuring a green future for posterity.

India now has 78 GW installed renewable energy capacity and plays a leadership role in international partnerships like the Solar Alliance to strengthen initiatives to fight climate change and global warming.

The Government is also striving hard to take the benefits of this growth and macroeconomic stability to the bottom of the pyramid, to the last man in the queue, through a range of initiatives.

But the most incredible opportunity that is at our disposal today is our tremendous demographic dividend. We have a perfectly balanced population pyramid where 65 per cent of our population is less than 35 years old today.

In-order to reap this dividend, we must revamp our 3Es (Education, Employment, and Employability), of which education is the most important, for it serves as the crucial fuel that propels India’s growth engine forward.

My dear sisters and brothers,

India has had a long and illustrious history of holistic education. The aim of education in ancient India was not just the acquisition of knowledge but also wisdom, complete realization and liberation of the self.

The Indian education system gave birth to scholars like Charaka and Susruta, Aryabhatta, Bhaskaracharya, Chanakya, Patanjali and Panini and numerous others.

They made seminal contributions to the collective knowledge of the world in diverse fields such as mathematics, astronomy, metallurgy, medical science and surgery, civil engineering and architecture, shipbuilding and navigation, yoga, fine arts, chess, and more.

Swami Vivekananda once said that “Education is not the amount of information that we put into your brain and runs riot there, undigested, all your life. We must have life-building, man-making, character-making assimilation of ideas.”

Culturally, India has been, and continues to be, a cradle of great diversity in all walks of life, with its myriad languages and dialects, with as many as seven classical dance forms and two classical music forms, many well-developed traditions of folk arts and music, pottery, sculptures and bronzes, exquisite architecture, incredible cuisines, fabulous textiles of all kinds, and so much more.

These rich legacies to world heritage must not only be nurtured and preserved for posterity, but also enhanced and put to new uses through our education system.

We should integrate this rich tradition with modern education to help develop the creativity and originality of students, and to encourage them to innovate.

Such multidisciplinary education and 21st century capabilities necessary for the employment landscape of the future - such as critical thinking, communication, problem solving, creativity, cultural literacy, global outlook, teamwork, ethical reasoning, and social responsibility - will not only help to develop outstanding employees but also outstanding citizens and communities, in the next twenty five years.

Such an articulation of a broad view of education encompassing the holistic development of students with special emphasis on the development of the creative potential of each individual, in all its richness and complexity, has grown increasingly popular in recent years.

Students must develop not only cognitive skills – both ‘foundational skills’ of literacy and numeracy and ‘higher-order’ cognitive skills such as critical thinking and problem solving skills - but also social and emotional skills, also referred to as ‘soft skills’, including cultural awareness and empathy, perseverance and grit, teamwork and leadership, among others.

Based on the developments that have taken place in the world of cognitive science, there is now deep engagement with the idea that these social and emotional competencies must be acquired by all learners and that all learners should become more academically, socially and emotionally competent.  

The Draft National education Policy 2019 focuses on the holistic aspect of education. The Policy emphasizes that education throughout life is based on four pillars:

i) Learning to know - acquiring a body of knowledge and learning how to learn;

ii) Learning to do - acquiring not only an occupational skill but also the competence to deal with many situations and work in teams and deal with the various challenges of working life;

iii) Learning to live together – developing an understanding of other people and an appreciation of interdependence in a spirit of respect for the values of pluralism, mutual understanding and peace; and

iv) Learning to be - developing one’s personality and being able to act with autonomy, judgement and personal responsibility.

To provide such multidisciplinary and holistic education to the students it is essential to combine education with a number of co-curricular activities, including community service.

Education alone will not be sufficient to reap the demographic dividend. It is necessary that we boost the employability of our graduates through intensive skilling programs, especially in cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Robotics etc. 

Single-skill and single-discipline jobs are likely to become automated over time. Therefore, there will be a great need to focus on multidisciplinary and 21st century competencies for future work roles - these are indeed the capabilities that will separate the developed countries from underdeveloped countries in future.

Apart from the intellectual and emotional development of our youngsters, we must also focus on health and physical fitness. Our educational institutions must be partners in initiatives of the government such as ‘Fit India’ and ‘Khelo India’ and must encourage students to lead a physically active life.

I am sure that Maharaja Agrasen College will be successful in its pursuit to create model global citizens with a strong national consciousness and will thrive in a cosmopolitan world.

I once again congratulate all of you on this accomplishment and wish each and every one of you the very best in your future endeavors.

Thank You! Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu expressed concern over the prevalence of social evils and asked people to play a proactive role to eradicate instances of social evils like untouchability and gender discrimination. He said that there was an urgent need to put together an eco-system that utilizes the pool of extraordinary talent, ideas and innovative capabilities available in the country to ensure inclusive and sustainable development. 

Speaking after releasing books on Selected Speeches of hon’ble President of India, Shri Ramnath Kovind, titled ‘The Republican Ethic (vol. 2)’ and ‘Loktantra ke Swar (khand 2)’ at the Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra in New Delhi today, the Vice President said that India was at a the crucial moment in its history where it could take the major leap forward towards inclusive development by overcoming major challenges and formidable obstacles lying its way to achieving inclusive development 

The Vice President said that upholding values and ethics was of paramount importance for people in public life and added that both he and the hon’ble President Shri Ram Nath Kovind, felt strongly about it and their priorities for the nation converged at a number of points such as the “clean India, an educated skilled India, an innovative India, a fit India and a harmonious, strong and empowered India” 

The Vice President said that he witnessed the essence of the Nation, its vision, aspirations, expectations and its ethos in the President’s addresses on many occasions and that his clarity of thought – his ability to analyse and synthesise was evident in all speeches of the hon’ble President – whether he was addressing the nation on landmark occasions; addressing his exalted audiences during his foreign visits or promoting the cause of education and inculcating values among the youth of this country.  

Shri Naidu said that the President constantly reminded us of the contributions of our Annadaatas – the farmers, our scientists and professions and above all our brave jawans. 

Observing that education was a recurring theme, reflected in many speeches of the hon’ble President, the Vice President opined that to Shri Kovind, education is not about accumulating facts and figures. “Education, for him, is an instrument of empowerment. He wants our Universities to be the powerhouses of progress towards a new India. He specially pins his hopes on our scientific institutions”, he added.

The Vice President noted that being a seasoned and distinguished lawyer, hon’ble President was aware of the power and challenges of the profession. “Being a firm believer of social change through constitutional methods, Shri Kovind always emphasises the potential of legal profession in delivery of justice to the poorest of the poor – in wiping away the tears from the eyes of the most unfortunate”, he said.

Underscoring that the President expected a high level of commitment and empathy among the bureaucrats because they are crucial instruments of delivering the fruits of a democratic constitution to the masses, the Vice President said that Shri. Kovind has inspired hundreds of young civil servants, belonging to various services, to become change agents delivering social justice and acting as custodians of constitutional ethic and rule of law. He added that the book of selected speeches was a profound collection of our President’s nuggets of wisdom.

Referring to a quote from the book on India’s commitment to protecting the sovereignty of the country through peaceful means, the Vice President said that India has always strongly adhered to the values of peace and co-operation but warned that the country would give a befitting reply to any acts of aggression against it. 

The Vice President complimented the Minister of Information & Broadcasting, Shri Prakash Javadekar and his team in the Ministry for publishing the collection of speeches of honourable President.

Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister of Environment, Forest & Climate Change and Information & Broadcasting, Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, Minister of Social Justice & Empowerment, Shri Amit Khare, Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Smt. Sadhana Rout, Pr. DG, Publications Division and others were present at the occasion. 

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am privileged to release the Volumes of Selected Speeches of our Hon’ble President, Shri Ram Nath Kovindji, a friend, philosopher and guide to all of us. I am doubly honoured, as I had this pleasant duty of releasing the first volumes of his speeches as well. 

At the outset I must congratulate Shri Prakash Javadekarji, Minister of Information & Broadcasting for his dynamic leadership and his excellent team in the Ministry for publishing this collection of speeches of our beloved President.

As the Head of the State, the First Citizen of our robust Republic, he represents the essence of the Nation, its vision, aspirations, expectations and, above all, its ethos.  I have been following his erudite addresses, in which, I find an earnest call for inclusiveness I find in his statements a rare pragmatism, a close connect with our people and a vision for a new India.

I am pleased to note that this year also, the fascinating diversity of our nation is reflected through these speeches. Again, the overriding ethos of our country – the ethos of Vasudhaiva Kutumbkam – the world is one family reverberates through the wise words of our President. 

We, as a country, have chosen the path of democracy to achieve a better quality of life for all people. The faith of Shri Kovindji in democratic values is unwavering. And he goes much deeper and reveals before us multiple aspects - layer after layer, when he delves into the vision of our republic.  Addressing the nation on the eve of 70th Republic Day, he reaffirmed this faith in beautiful words, and I quote:  

Our Republic’s vision is that of reaching democratic goals by democratic means, pluralistic goals by pluralistic means, enlightened goals by enlightened means, inclusive goals by inclusive means, compassionate goals by compassionate means – and constitutional goals by constitutional means.   

This clarity of thought – this ability to analyse and synthesise – is evident in all speeches of the Hon’ble President – whether he is addressing the nation on landmark occasions; addressing his exalted audiences during his foreign visits or promoting the cause of education and inculcating values among the youth of this country.  

The same spirit prevails when he reminds the contributions of our Annadaatas – the farmers, our scientists and professions and above all our brave jawans. 

He evokes the idea of excellence and exhorts young entrants of our bureaucracy to stand like a rock to safeguard our Constitutional ethos. 

This is a profound collection of our President’s nuggets of wisdom. You find in this collection some excellent thoughts on national priorities, his fascination towards the diversity of national life, his visionary worldview, his commitment towards better education and better opportunities to all. They emphasize pursuit of excellence and good governance at every level and his concern and admiration for our brave defence forces, quite rightly, as their Supreme Commander.  There is a special segment on Kovindji’s speeches commemorating Gandhiji – the embodiment of the idea of India.

Education is a recurring theme, reflected in many speeches of the Hon’ble President. For him, education is not about accumulating facts and figures.  Education, for him, is an instrument of empowerment. He wants our Universities to be the powerhouses of progress towards a new India. He specially pins his hopes on our scientific institutions. Delivering the convocation address at IIT, Hyderabad he says- I quote-

“The best scientific universities and institutions of learning are not just teaching shops or degree factories. Increasingly, they are sources of innovation and incubators of technology and technology-driven start-ups.” 

This is Shri Kovindji’s vision for optimum utilization of resources in a holistic manner to create eco-systems and incubators for progress – for start ups and ultimately, for a ‘New India.’

However, material gains apart, he never loses sight of the moral compass of education. Addressing on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of St. Thomas College, Trissur, he says, and I quote: 

I have always believed that greatest service to God is to help another person, to heal another person and to spread the light of knowledge to another person.  Unquote. 

Being a seasoned and distinguished lawyer, Hon’ble President is aware of the power and challenges of the profession. Being a firm believer of social change through constitutional methods, Shri Kovind always emphasises the potential of legal profession in delivery of justice to the poorest of the poor – in wiping away the tears from the eyes of the most unfortunate. Addressing a function on the occasion of the platinum jubilee of Karnataka law society, Hon’ble President emphasises, and I quote:

Law is not a career, it is a calling. More than a mean to earn a livelihood, it is a mechanism to assist the cause of justice, to help the poorest and the most unfortunate among us, and to build a society and nation defined by adherence to rules, norms and fairness.  Unquote. 

The President expects a high level of commitment and empathy among the bureaucrats because they are crucial instruments of delivering the fruits of a democratic constitution to the masses. Last two years, he has inspired hundreds of young civil servants, belonging to various services, to become change agents delivering social justice and acting as custodians of constitutional ethic and rule of law. Addressing young officers of Indian Police Service, his observations are so pertinent and practical: 

“In many ways, police represents and symbolises the quality of state itself. For a common citizen and visitor to a country, the impression of the state and governance is formed by their interactions with the traffic constable at the signal, the beat officer on neighbourhood patrol and the reception desk officer in a police station.”

These messages of concern and empathy, which are hallmarks of our national ethos, are reflected in Hon’ble President’s interaction abroad as well, symbolizing Indian ethos and India’s offer of friendship and camaraderie to all.  Addressing the House of Representatives in Cyprus, he says, and I quote:

When we think for India and when we act for India, we try to think and act for the world. We are clear in our belief that the global village is an organic, integrated entity, where everybody, every nation, is part of an interlinked chain and contributes to each other’s prosperity. Unquote.

But one thing is clear in his mind. Goodwill should never be construed as weakness of our sovereign nation. As Supreme Commander of our glorious armed forces, President has unquestioned clarity in this matter.  On the occasion of presenting standards to 118 Helicopter Unit and Colours to Air Defence College, he says, and I quote: 

Though we remain firmly committed to peace, we are determined to use all our might to protect the sovereignty of our nation. Whenever an occasion demanded, our brave men and women in uniform have ensured that the nation has dealt with the security challenges forcefully and effectively.  Unquote. 

This year, indebted nation is celebrating 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Hon’ble President is the Chairperson of National Commemoration Committee. At home and abroad, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, spread the message of Mahatma in beautiful words. He reminded India and the world the timeless wisdom of Gandhiji’s advice-

I quote:

“The Mahatma gave us a talisman to judge any policy and indeed, any action - to assess if the proposed action would enhance the life, dignity and destiny of the poorest person we met. This is the talisman for all times, all places and all conditions.” 

And lastly, to conclude, our best take-away today is perhaps, these noble hopes of our respected President, from his address to the joint session of Parliament, in June 2019, and I quote:

A New India: where equal opportunities to progress are available to every person; where life of every person becomes better and their self-esteem is enhanced; where brotherhood and harmony bind the people with each other; where the foundation built on our ideals and values become stronger; and where benefits of development reach every region and the last person standing in queue.  Unquote.  

This is an expression of a dream that every Indian is dreaming today.  This is the ideal that we are trying to pursue.  This is the vision that our Prime Minister has articulated in his numerous public speeches, the most recent being the Independence Day address on the 15th of August.  

The President and I are on the same page. 

We feel equally strongly about upholding values and ethics in public life. 

We feel concerned at the persistence of social evils like untouchability, gender discrimination and socio-economic inequalities. 

Our priorities for the nation converge at a number of points. 

I strongly feel that India is at a crucial moment in its history where it can take the major leap forward towards inclusive development.  

There are major challenges.  There are formidable obstacles. 

But we have a pool of extraordinary talent in our country. We have ideas and innovative capabilities.  We must put together an eco-system that builds upon this excellent foundation.  

A clean India, an educated skilled India, an innovative India, a fit India and a harmonious, strong, empowered India is a dream we all share.  

The President of India gives an eloquent expression to some of these hopes and aspirations.  The books is a testament of faith in the strength of India.  It is a rejuvenating stream of ideas for us to understand the core of our republican ethic. 

I congratulate Ministry of Information & Broadcasting and the Publications Division for this noble effort. It is heartening to see that the initiatives taken during my tenure in Ministry of I&B are being carried forward with devotion and due diligence. I congratulate Shri Amit Khare, Secretary, I&B, Smt. Sadhana Rout, Principal DG, Publications Division and the entire team in Publications Division for bringing out such excellently produced books. Let the good work continue. I am thankful to the presence of Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot ji, members of diplomatic corps, Secretaries to the Government of India and other dignitaries, and the very receptive audience. 

I do hope we will all read these books and benefit from the President’s thoughts as we collectively build a Republican ethic we can all be proud of. 

Thank you.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon the Indian Diaspora to effectively counter false propaganda and negative narrative about India, particularly in the wake of the recent reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir State.

Speaking after releasing the Coffee Table Book titled 'Glorious Diaspora- Pride of India' containing brief profiles of the recipients of Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards from 2003 to 2019 in New Delhi today, he said the overseas Indians must create awareness in the countries of their stay that the dilution of Article 370 was purely an internal administrative measure and aimed at accelerating the development of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.

It has nothing to do with religion and any such false propaganda should be rebutted, he added.

Cautioning that some vested interests at times spread a lot of disinformation about India in the western media by portraying a negative image, Shri Naidu said “ a few isolated incidents are used to spin fictitious narratives that intolerance, religious and social disharmony are on the rise in India”.

The Pravasi Bharatiyas must effectively counter such falsehoods and project the correct image of India, especially on the harmonious co-existence of the people belonging to all religions and various social groups, the Vice President added.

Describing the Indian Diaspora as ambassadors of India’s great culture, heritage and its intrinsic values of humanism, the Vice President lauded their contributions for the welfare of the nation through their philanthropic and charitable work.

Observing that giving back to the society was key element of Indian philosophy, the Vice President asked the diaspora to contribute towards India’s growth story through greater participation in the areas of education, health, and agriculture. He urged them to become partners in programmes such as Swachh Bharat, Clean Ganga, Make in India, Digital India, and Skill India and strengthen them.

Shri Naidu appreciated the Indian Diaspora Club for bringing out the book.  He said that since the launch of Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award (PBSA) in 2003, many deserving people of Indian origin from around the world have been honoured--they include politicians, business leaders, scientists, economists and artists from around the world.

Shri Rajat Kapoor, Managing Director, Indian Diaspora Club, Dr. Dnyaneshwar Mulay, IFS (Retd.), Member of the National Human Rights Commission, Lord Raj Loomba, Founder and Chairman Trustee of Loomba Foundation, Shri Dinesh Patnaik, Additional Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, Shri Kanwaljit Singh Bakshi, MP (New Zealand) and other dignitaries attended the event.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am pleased to launch this Coffee Table Book titled 'Glorious Diaspora- Pride of India' containing brief profiles of the recipients of Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards from 2003 to 2019

As you all are aware, the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award (PBSA) is the highest honour conferred upon overseas Indian by the Indian Government. Since the launch of the award in 2003, many deserving people of Indian origin from around the world have been honoured--they include politicians, business leaders, scientists, economists and artists from around the world.

I must compliment Mr. Rajat Kapoor of the Indian Diaspora Club for bringing out this coffee table book – ‘Glorious Diaspora- Pride of India’.

The Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award is being conferred as part of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) Convention on a Non-Resident Indian, Person of Indian Origin or an organization or institution established and run by the Non-Resident Indians or Persons of Indian Origin, who have made a significant contribution in any one of the following ways:

For promoting a better understanding of India abroad;

Supporting India’s causes and concerns in a tangible way;

Building closer links between India, the overseas Indian community and their country of residence;

Social and humanitarian causes in India or abroad;

The welfare of the local Indian community;

Philanthropic and charitable work;

 

Eminence in one’s field or outstanding work, which has enhanced India’s prestige in the country of residence; or Eminence in skills which has enhanced India’s prestige in that country (for non-professional workers).

Dear sisters and brothers,

January 9 was chosen as the day to celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) since it was on this day in 1915 that Mahatma Gandhi, the greatest Pravasi, returned to India from South Africa, led India’s freedom struggle and changed the lives of Indians forever.

As you all are aware, the Conventions are being organized to connect India with its vast overseas diaspora and bring their knowledge, expertise, and skills onto a common platform. While the convention was held on an annual basis till 2014, it is being organized once in two years from 2015.

I am glad that over the years Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Conventions have become effective platforms for the exchange of views and networking to the Persons of Indian Origin on matters of common interest. These Conventions also provide an occasion to better understand the expectations of the overseas Indians and acknowledge their role in India’s progress and development.

While the late Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji is credited with having promoted serious engagement with the Indian diaspora to develop mutually beneficial linkages, the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji has intensified it. In his foreign trips and outreach activities with India’s expatriate communities, he has been persuading them to “contribute to India’s growth story”.

The Prime Minister has invited the NRIs and PIOs to not only share the vision of India in the new millennium but also help us shape its contours.

Dear sisters and brothers,

The NRIs, PIOs and professionals settled abroad are India’s cultural ambassadors and play a key role in strengthening the country’s image. Apart from promoting India’s cultural values and traditions, they must also actively counter false propaganda on India, especially in the wake of the recent reorganization of the Jammu and Kashmir State.

The overseas Indians must create awareness in the countries of their stay that the dilution of Article 370 was purely an internal administrative measure aimed at accelerating the development of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. It has nothing to do with religion and any such false propaganda should be rebutted.

At times, we also find that some vested interests spread a lot of disinformation about India in the western media by portraying a negative image. A few isolated incidents are used to spin fictitious narratives that intolerance, religious and social disharmony are on the rise in India. 

The Pravasi Bharatiyas must effectively counter such falsehoods and project the correct image of India, especially on the harmonious co-existence of the people belonging to all religions and various social groups.

I would also like the Indian diaspora to contribute towards India’s growth story through greater participation in the areas of education, health and agriculture. The overseas Indians must partners in programmes like Swachh Bharat, Clean Ganga, Make In India, Digital India, and Skill India. I am sure, the diaspora has plenty to contribute.

Apart from conducting outreach activities to engage with the overseas Indians, the government is also encouraging the diaspora to contribute to India’s growth through philanthropy, knowledge transfers, investments in innovation and assistance in other development projects.

Over the years, the diaspora has become an increasingly important factor in international politics. The Jewish, Chinese and British diasporas have achieved successes in their second homes. The Indian diaspora, for their part, have many of the elements required for success — they are a “model minority”, they are affluent, and they are growing in number. Many of them are willing to exert their influence in electoral politics and are engaged in multinational businesses, and are thus highly visible. This makes for a ripe environment for India to aggressively tap on its potential.

I am sure that the glorious journey of overseas Indians will continue to inspire us with their passion to excel and emotion to connect with their motherland in various ways.

Indian Diaspora Club deserves appreciation for taking the lead for publication of this attractive Coffee Table Book with such an inspiring profile of Distinguished Overseas Indians who have made their indelible mark in various fields.

My best wishes to all of you for future endeavours!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for providing integrated and holistic education to children.

Describing teachers as architects of national development, he advised them to inculcate values of democracy, equality, freedom, justice, secularism, concern for others well being, respect for human dignity and human rights in children.

Addressing teachers from Delhi Tamil Education Association Schools on the occasion of Teacher’s Day, here today, Shri Naidu said the best way to pay tribute to India’s first Vice President Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was by conducting themselves as ideal teachers.

The Vice President called upon teachers to rededicate themselves to transform   classrooms into hubs of joyful learning by raising the entire education system to a much higher level than what exists today.

He also wanted them to understand the psyche, strengths, and weaknesses of children during their interactions with them in classrooms and counsel them.  

Stressing the need to make the Children aware of the rich heritage, traditions and the glorious history of the country, Shri Naidu wanted text-books to include lessons on freedom fighters, eminent scientists, artists, and others to inspire children.  

The Vice President asked for inclusion of concepts such as sustainable development, living with nature, making children aware of programs such as Swachh Bharat, Clean India, and other people’s movements.

Shri Naidu said it was necessary to promote physical education at par with academics and encourage students to actively take part in activities such as sports, games, and yoga to ensure that they were fit and healthy.  

Talking about the importance of mother tongue, the Vice President urged teachers and parents to encourage children to speak in their mother tongue at home. He also wanted mother tongue to be the medium of instruction up to primary school level.

At the same time, the Vice President advised children to learn as many languages as possible.  Saying that one should not hesitate to learn new languages, the Vice President, however, said no language should be imposed and that no language should be opposed.

Observing that the country needs teachers with competence, confidence and commitment to bring in a difference in the educational landscape, the Vice President said the teachers have the unique opportunity to lay the foundations of a vibrant nation through their knowledge, attitude, behaviour and the ability to create the right conditions for learning.

The Vice President sought comments, suggestions and ‘innovative’ inputs of educators, teachers, and scholars on the new education policy and asked them to contribute to the shaping of a policy that would take our country forward in the 21st century.

More than 100 teachers from the Delhi Tamil Education Association and students of various schools were present at the event. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to be with all of you today on the occasion of Teachers' Day, a day when the nation celebrates the extraordinary contribution teachers are making to national development. It is a day when we respectfully remember the first Vice President of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a great teacher, an intellectual giant and an eloquent exponent of Hindu philosophy.

Ours is a country that has given a central place to teachers. We call them ‘gurus’, a Sanskrit word that connotes ‘a source of illumination’. In fact, the respect a teacher receives in our culture is well depicted in the lines:

“Gurur Brahmaa, Gurur Vishnuh, Gurur Devo Maheshwarah Guru Saakshaat Parabrahma Tasmai Shri Gurave Namah— ‘Guru is like Brahma the Creator initiating us into learning, Vishnu the Preserver nurturing our talents and Maheshwara the Destroyer dispelling doubts and negative thoughts. Guru is the Supreme God and my salutation to such a Guru’.

We are the inheritors of the system of gurukulas. A system in which the teachers and the students lived together and pursued studies in a caring environment. It was a system of education that was based on a constant dialogue between the teacher and students. It was a system that promoted the concept of ‘Vidya’ as a process of discovery.

You are all blessed to have the unique opportunity to shape the destiny of our nation in your classrooms every day and every minute through your interaction with students.

We, in India, have come a long way after independence. Today, 95 percent of children are in schools and we have more universities and institutions of excellence than we had in 1947.

Nearly 70 lakh teachers are teaching 20 crore children in 15 lakh elementary schools across the country. The literacy rate has been steadily improving from a mere 18 percent in 1947 to nearly 80 percent at present.

One of the most important issues facing school education today is the need to improve quality in education and learning.

We need more teachers who can build in our children a commitment to the values of democracy, equality, freedom, justice, secularism, concern for others well being, respect for human dignity and human rights. Children should be made aware of our rich heritage and the glorious history.

I call upon all teachers at all levels in the country, in the pre-primary centres, elementary schools, high schools, colleges and universities to rededicate themselves and pledge that they will transform the classrooms into hubs of joyful learning and raise the entire education system to a much higher level than what exists today.

We cannot rest on the past laurels. Nor can we be satisfied with a few islands of excellence. We need a system that responds effectively to the learning needs of all children, youth and adults and keeps constantly innovating.

We need teachers who have the required competence, confidence and commitment to make a difference to the educational landscape of our country.

As has been said:

“The mediocre teacher tells;
The good teacher explains;
The superior teacher demonstrates;
The great teacher inspires.”

What we need today are more and more great teachers. We need teachers who are learners and creators.

We need inspirational, transformational leaders in our classrooms.

It is not merely the grand building that makes a school good but the dedication and commitment of teachers that makes it great.

Dr. Radhakrishnan had said; “true teachers are those who help us think for ourselves”. 

In a similar vein, Shri Aurobindo has said “The teacher is not an instructor or task-master, he is a helper and a guide”.

All these principles emanate from our ancient Indian heritage which views education as integrated development of all faculties. As Swami Vivekananda said, “We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded and by which one can stand on one’s own feet”.

The new education policy contains a lot of good ideas. It is before the country for comments, suggestions and ‘innovative’ inputs. Please have a look at the draft and contribute to the shaping of a policy that will take our country forward in the 21st century.

You, teachers, are the key architects of national development. You lay the foundations of a vibrant nation through your knowledge, attitude, behaviour and your ability to create the right conditions for learning. You lay the foundations for your happy, fulfilling life. I wish you all the best in your efforts to shape a new, resurgent India.

Thank you.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon the world community to work together to completely root out terrorism and promote a peaceful global order.

Speaking at the valedictory session of a national conference on ‘India-Africa Partnership in a Changing Global Order--Priorities, Prospects and Challenges’, organized by the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA)  in New Delhi, Shri Naidu said that terrorism is the enemy of humanity and must be eliminated.

Observing that peace was a prerequisite for progress, he asserted that India believed in peaceful relations with all countries, including one of its neighbors provided they did not interfere in the internal affairs of the country.

The Vice President also called for enlarging and democratizing the United Nations Security Council, while pointing out that India represented one-sixth of the global population. He said that India and Africa have common interests in issues such as UN Security Council reforms, counter-terrorism, peacekeeping and cybersecurity.

He said that India would stand with Africa for a just, representative and democratic global order to provide a voice for one-third of the humanity that lives in Africa and India.

Saying that India and African nations have always been natural partners in civilization, culture, and progress, the Vice President said that they were forged by a strong bond of long traditions of friendship, civilizational contacts, historical goodwill, shared experiences, mutuality of worldviews and interests.

Shri Naidu said that Africa’s support played a decisive role in making the Non- Aligned Movement initiated by India, Yugoslavia, and Egypt into a powerful voice of the developing world.

“The sense of solidarity and unity formed during the Cold War days continues to drive the India-Africa relations to this date,” he added.

Opining that there was a greater scope for India Africa business cooperation, the Vice President said that Africa became an important trade and investment partner for the country with USD 62.66 billion bilateral trade in 2017 – 2018. With cumulative investments in Africa amounting to US$54 billion, he said that India was the fourth-largest investor in Africa and expressed hope that there was scope to explore for more opportunities.

Stating that India Africa development partnership model seeks mutual benefits through a consultative process, he said that it was responsive to the needs and priorities of African countries. Both India and Africa have vital stakes in each other’s progress, peace, and prosperity, he added.

The Vice President said that India’s development initiatives including capacity building and human resource development under ITEC, Lines of Credit and Grant Assistance to Africa made it a close partner of Africa in its socio-economic transformation.

Shri Naidu released two publications of Indian Council of World Affairs titled शक्ति की मान्यता: संयुक्त राष्ट्र् सुरक्षा परिषद (Shakti Ki Manyata- Samyukta Rashtra Suraksha Parishad) written by Shri Dilip Sinha and भारत और यूरोपीय संघ: एक अंतरंग द्रष्टिकोण लेखक (Bharat Aur European Sangh: Ek Antarangik Drishtikon) written by Bhaswati Mukherjee.

The Vice President also advised ICWA to bring out publications in Hindi and other Indian languages.

Mr. Alem Tsehaye Woldemariam, Ambassador of the Republic of Etria and Dean of African Groups of Heads of Mission, Dr. T.C.A. Raghavan, DG, ICWA, Dr. Nivedita Ray, Director Research, ICWA and members of Indian Council of World Affairs were present.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to be here at Sapru House for the Valedictory session of the national conference on India - Africa Relations in the Changing Global Order.

Africa has been accorded a very high priority in India’s foreign policy. While articulating our Africa policy in 10 broad guiding principles, Prime Minister Modi during his visit to Uganda on 25 July 2018, stated that “we will continue to intensify and deepen our engagement with Africa… it will be sustained and regular”.

There are some key areas that have been highlighted as high priority in India’s Africa-outreach. 

We are clear that our development partnership would be guided by African priorities and agendas. It will be on terms that are comfortable to Africa; that will liberate Africa’s potential and not constrain their future.

India, with its vast experience with the digital revolution would certainly support Africa’s development; improve delivery of public services; extend education and health; spread digital literacy; expand financial inclusion; and mainstream the marginalized.

India will also work with Africa to improve agriculture as Africa has 60% of the world’s arable land, but produces just 10% of the global output.

India and Africa fought colonialism together. Both regions have experienced the exploitation and subsequent ruination associated with colonialism. India will therefore work together for a just, representative and democratic global order that has a voice for one-third of humanity that lives in Africa and India.

As India strengthens and intensifies its engagement with Africa, the need to promote a better understanding on India-African relations and Indian perspective on African Affairs, becomes even more important.

India on its part has initiated a series of policy interventions like TEAM 9 initiative, Focus Africa Programme and India Africa Forums Summit process to strengthen and diversify India’s the engagement with African states.

This national conference therefore is very timely and relevant.

I am glad that ICWA has brought together scholars, experts, analysts on African studies from across India to this conference to discuss and debate on wide spectrum of issues relating to India-Africa ties.

It is indeed noteworthy that the conference explored Five most important themes in India-Africa relation, Governance and Geopolitics, Economic and Development Cooperation, Diaspora Relations, Common Security Challenges, Media, Culture and Education exchange and Promotion of African studies in India.

I am particularly happy that this conference takes place on the threshold of the 150th birth anniversary of the father of our nation. To the vast masses of our country Africa is indistinguishable from the Mahatma’s first Karmabhoomi. His early struggles for equity and justice contributed greatly to cementing older cultural and historical links between India and Africa.

I am happy to note that the conference over the past two days held very productive discussions on various dimensions of India-Africa relations, the ways to advance our wide-ranging ties and more importantly on means to promote African Studies in India, to bridge the knowledge gap on Africa in India.

India and Africa have always been natural partners in civilization, culture and progress. The bonding has been forged by long traditions of friendship, civilizational contacts, historical goodwill, shared experiences, mutuality of worldviews and interests.

India has strong historical ties with countries in Africa. The countries in the region share the common legacy

of struggle against colonialism. Africa’s support played a decisive role in making the Non- Aligned Movement initiated by India, Yugoslavia and Egypt into a powerful voice of the developing world. The sense of solidarity and unity formed during the Cold War days continues to drive India-Africa relations to this date.

Over the last decade we have seen how the relationship has acquired a renewed significance with fundamental changes seen in the respective regions and the international system.

India’s rise as a significant economic and global player which aspires to be a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 as outlined  in  the Economic Survey-2019  and Africa’s rapid economic growth and its desire to take charge of its own destiny, as outlined in its Agenda 2063 adopted in January 2015, are factors that are shaping the contemporary relationship.

Africa’s Agenda 2063 today seeks to deliver on a set of Seven Aspirations that reflect its desire for shared prosperity and well-being, for unity and integration, for a continent of free citizens and expanded horizons, where the full potential of women and youth are realised, and with freedom from fear, disease and want. 

Africa’s priorities and commitments to its seven aspirations are in line with India’s 10 broad guiding principles of its engagement with Africa.

Today Africa is poised to be a significant growth engine in the global economy.  It is a continent that holds immense opportunity given its rising economic growth and, education standards; quest for democracy; pursuit for regional integration, relentless efforts to mitigate conflict and address security threats; abundance of natural resources and fastest growing youth population and human capital.

Our interactions with Africa in recent years have acquired vibrancy and dynamism.

There has been unprecedented intensification of our political engagement with Africa with 32 high-level visits to African countries apart from several Ministerial visits; and in addition and we have hosted over 36 leaders from Africa since the third India-Africa Forum Summit held in 2015.

India has already opened 6 of the 18 additional Missions in Africa to increase its diplomatic outreach in Africa. This focus will further strengthen in the years ahead.

Africa has become an important trade and investment partner for us. Our bilateral trade stood at USD 62.66 billion in 2017 - 2018, and cumulative investments in Africa amounting to US$54 billion, making India the fourth-largest investor in Africa. However there remains great uncharted potential to be explored.

We view the signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA), which will make Africa the largest free trade area in the world, as yet another opportunity to boost trade and economic ties with Africa.

Our model of development partnership seeks mutual benefits through a consultative process and is responsive to the needs and priorities of African countries.

Towards this end, our development initiatives including capacity building and human resource development under ITEC, Lines of Credit and Grant Assistance has made India a close partner of Africa in its socio-economic transformation.

We have vital stakes in each other’s progress, peace and prosperity.

It is indeed noteworthy that India has provided 189 LOCs to 42 African countries for a total of US$11 billion, which represents 42 percent of the total amount of LOCs offered by India through EXIM Bank.

The projects that are being implemented under Indian LoCs have expanded our development cooperation and cover a range of sectors including power generation and distribution, water related projects, railways, sugar plants, infrastructure, agriculture, irrigation and Information Communication and Technology.

As development is closely linked with security, preserving peace and security has become an important element in our engagement. Over the years   we have deepened our security and defence cooperation with many countries in Africa.

At the international level we have common interests in issues such as UN Security Council reforms, counter-terrorism, peacekeeping, and cyber security.

In our 10 guiding principles PM Modi has articulated that “ We will strengthen our cooperation and mutual capabilities in combating terrorism and extremism; keeping our cyberspace safe and secure; and, supporting the UN in advancing and keeping peace”.

The Indian Ocean, the third largest ocean in the world that amounts to 20% of the global oceans, over the last two decades has been facing grave maritime security challenges, especially in the form of piracy.

These daunting problems are dynamic and cross-jurisdictional. Consequently, combating them necessitates combined efforts and unified response from India, Africa and other nations along the shores of the Indian Ocean, making maritime security a crucial area of cooperation.

Our cooperation in other sectors such as education, health, information technology and skill development continues to grow, and our partnership has also expanded to new frontiers including, digital technology, blue economy and climate change.

In today’s integrated foreign policy domain Africa is and must continue to remain at the centre of our radar.

Whether we look at the vast Western Indian Ocean with all its ramifications or at India’s civilizational contacts with the East coast of the African continent or indeed in any other manner that conclusion is inevitable.

Therefore while the pragmatic element of our interest in Africa cannot be denied, but what is equally important is this external policies should be sustained and given proper direction by an intellectual climate.

In other words our policy goals and objectives in Africa cannot become meaningful unless we have sufficient knowledge and expertise about Africa in India.

It is in these contexts that African studies in India and promoting Indo-African intellectual understanding assumes added importance.

I would therefore like the Indian Council of World affairs to continue with its traditional focus on Africa and hold such conferences periodically and also focus in the sub regional dimensions.

Once again, I congratulate ICWA for this endeavour and extend my best wishes to all the delegates. I hope that the relationship between India and Africa continue to flourish bringing peace and prosperity to both regions.

 

Thank You!

 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu attended a prayer meeting held in memory of Late Shri Arun Jaitley, the former union Finance Minister, in New Delhi today and paid his respects.

Shri. Naidu took to social media to pay tributes to Late Shri Arun Jaitley, and said that Shri Jaitley was a close associate and a dear friend. “Jaitley ji will forever be remembered as one of the most prominent architects of India’s socio-economic resurgence”, he said. 

The Vice President said that Shri Arun Jaitley was an outstanding Parliamentarian, legal luminary, towering intellectual, an able administrator and a statesman of impeccable integrity. “He distinguished himself by effectively handling important portfolios as Union Minister”, he added.

Referring to Shri Jaitley’s vast repertoire of knowledge and his grasp of both national and international issues, Shri Naidu said that he would be missed by one and all for the hall mark perspectives he used to present on all major issues, enriching public and parliamentary discourse. 

Observing that Shri Arun Jaitely epitomized versatility and was a multi-faceted genius, the Vice President said that he possessed remarkable clarity of thought and conviction. “He was a communicator par excellence and would articulate the most of complex issues in a simple manner”, he added.

The Vice President said that Shri Arun Jaitley has left an indelible mark on the canvas of India’s history and expressed hope that his life and legacy would inspire many more to take up the noble pursuit of serving the nation with dedication and selflessness.

Recalling that Shri Reddy and he were fellow-travellers for a considerable period in the politics of united Andhra Pradesh, the Vice President said that he was a friendly guide. 

Highlighting Shri Reddy’s mastery over the languages – English as well Telugu, Shri Naidu said that he was a brilliant Parliamentarian whose speeches were laced with wit, sarcasm, and humor. 

Stating that he was a man of integrity and never compromised on his principles, the Vice President said that Shri Reddy always held on firmly to his moral and political values. “He had brought name and fame to every position he had held without ever compromising on his fundamental beliefs”, he added.

Lauding Shri Reddy’s spirit, Shri Naidu said that through his words, deeds and accomplishments, he epitomized the real meaning of “differently-abled” and proved himself to be “extraordinarily-abled”. He added that Shri Reddy’s life was a saga of an irrepressible creative spirit that transcended all obstacles to soar to great heights.

The Vice President said that Shri Reddy’s life should become a role model for other politicians and added that he was an upright person and a man of integrity who dedicated his life in the service of common people. “Shri Jaipal Reddy was a gentleman-politician and known for his qualities of head and heart”, he added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has advised political parties to come up with long-term, constructive programmes to propel the country’s economic growth rather than resorting to populist, vote-catching schemes for temporary gains.

Speaking at a ‘Meet and Greet’ programme organized by the Vice President’s friends and well wishers at Nellore, Andhra Pradesh today, on the completion of his two years in office, Shri Naidu said that even 72 years after Independence, about 18-20 per cent of people were living below the poverty line and about 20 per cent were not literate.

The Vice President wanted the parties to focus on improving the basic amenities to the people, ensuring quality medical and educational facilities, combating gender and social discrimination and bridging the urban-rural divide.

Shri Naidu also asked political parties to be patient and tolerant towards the mandate given by the people. Respect rivals and accept constructive programmes with an open mind. Resorting to violence or hitting below-the-belt would be detrimental to democracy, he added.

The Vice President also called for initiating reforms in the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary to make India’s parliamentary democracy a role model for others to follow. There was a need to provide effective governance, cut down delays in judiciary and ensure that legislatures and the Parliament functioned without obstructions or disruptions. “Ultimately what matters is delivery of services to people”, he observed.  

Calling for a change of mindset, attitude, behavior and conduct on many aspects at different levels, Shri Naidu urged people to give up cynical thinking and adopt a positive and constructive attitude.

Asserting that there was a new-found enthusiasm and interest about India all over the world, the Vice President expressed confidence that India would be able to achieve double-digit growth if people functioned in a constructive manner.

Referring to the abrogation of Article 370, the Vice President described it as a simple reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir. Pointing out that Article 370 was a temporary provision in the Constitution, he said that it was a national issue and not a political one.

The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishen Reddy, the Minister for Irrigation, Andhra Pradesh, Shri P. Anil Kumar Yadav, the Members of Parliamnet, Shri Prabhakar Reddy and Shri Durga Prasad, MLAs, MLCs and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for collective efforts by the Government, NGOs and the private sector to remove economic inequalities in the country.

He lauded the efforts of various Industries and the NGOs in supplementing the efforts of the government in upgrading the skills of the youth and women through various programmes.

Addressing the gathering after inaugurating a “Two wheeler Technician Training Centre” set up by Hero Motor Corp in association with Swarna Bharat Trust and SOMA Technical Training Institute at Nellore in Andhra Pradesh today, the Vice President said the training center is equipped with world class training facility and a fully automated workshop and supported by fully trained faculty. Trainees from various parts of Andhra Pradesh and other States would get hands-on training in bike mechanic course.

He appreciated the efforts of Andhra Pradesh government to touch 20 million people in AP in next 15 years and provide them with skilling and entrepreneurship to meet the skilled demands of seven missions launched by the government.

The Vice President said it was important to have skilled manpower with the needed skill sets in various sectors to drive growth. It was also important to reduce urban-rural divide in terms of ensuring equitable growth and creating opportunities, he added.

Referring to the call given by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi to Reform, Perform and Transform, he said the connectivity revolution launched by former Prime Minister Shri A B Vajpayee was being accelerated by the present government to transform the lives of the people and fulfill their aspirations.

Referring to the various programmes undertaken by the Swarna Bharat Trust, he said that they were aimed at empowering the rural youth and women to stand on their feet by imparting the required training and skills in different vocations.

The Minister for Irrigation, Andhra Pradesh, Shri P. Anil Kumar Yadav, the CIO/CHRO, Hero Motor Corp, Shri Vijay Sethi, the Vice President of Hero Motor Corp, Shri Rajesh Makhija, the Managing Trustee of Swarna Bharat Trust, Smt. I. Deepa Venkat, Managing Trustee, Sri Muppavarapu Foundation, Shri M. Harshavardhan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to be present here and inaugurate “Two wheeler Technician Training Centre” established by Hero Motor Corp in association with Swarna Bharat Trust and SOMA Technical Training Institute. 

I am told that training center is equipped with World Class Training facility and a fully Automated workshop, with required Pneumatic tools & Precision equipment’s and supported by fully trained faculty. I am happy that trainees from various parts of Andhra Pradesh are going to get hands on training in bike mechanic course with qualified and professional trainers. 

My compliments and best wishes to the Management of Hero Motor Corp and Swarna Bharat Trust for their noble mission of fostering skill development. 

I was informed that Andhra Pradesh Government has formed 7 different Missions to achieve double-digit growth for the state and to make AP among the most developed state in the country. Among these, the Knowledge and Skills Mission has been formed to provide trained and skilled manpower to all other Missions. 

I appreciate the efforts of the government to touch 20 million people in AP in next 15 years and provide them skilling and entrepreneurship to meet skilled human power demands of all Missions and shape AP as the hub for skilled-workforce and knowledge.

As we look forward to make India a global economic superpower and an epicenter of knowledge, we must ensure that we create an enabling environment for innovation to thrive. Innovation must be complemented by creating a skilled manpower by tapping the huge demographic potential in the country.

It is widely acknowledged that India has the advantage of Demographic dividend. The demographic dividend is the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population’s age structure, mainly when the share of the working-age population is larger than the non-working age share of the population.

India is a young, aspirational country. 65% of our population is below 35 years of age. 62% of our population is in the working-age group of 15-59 years. We have a workforce of 48 crores and more than a crore join the workforce every year.

It is the right time that we reap the benefits of our demographic dividend by providing skills. Skills and knowledge are driving forces of economic growth and social development for any country.

As we aim to become a developed country with a $5 trillion economy, it is important to have skilled manpower with the needed skill sets in various sectors to spur growth. It is also important to reduce urban- rural divide in terms of ensuring equitable growth and creating opportunities.

We also need to equip our students with effective communication skills. Mere degrees and diplomas will not make a person employable. For instance, a NASSCOM Survey (2011) found that only 25 percent of the graduates working in the IT sector have the required skills.

Therefore, your degree and diploma need to be supplemented by appropriate skills to take full advantage of the innumerable opportunities in the globalized and liberalized economic environment.

It is important to nurture the talent of our youth to disrupt the status quo and lead to radical innovations. Aligned with our growing economic profile, we have promoted skill development as a National Mission.

Universities should not only be the knowledge hubs but also need to emerge as the hotspots of research, incubation, and innovation. There is a great need to build a strong research ecosystem by collaborative, inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary research initiatives.

Expenditure on Research and Development is a key indicator of private and public sectors effort to foster competitive advantage of Science and Technology. But in India, public expenditure on Research and Development is rather low.

Empowering the youth by skill-building is a powerful tool in current times. It will enhance the efficacy and quality of the work for improved productivity and growth in the future.

I am happy to learn that more than a crore youth are being imparted skill training annually under various programmes of the Government. 56 lakh youth have been trained under flagship Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna, since its inception.

I am happy that government at the Centre and several state governments have been focusing on providing training courses and modules based on Industry requirements. 

Our country is poised for a big transition. Youth are the agents of this transformation. I call upon each one of you to use the available programmes and expanded opportunities.

India is transforming and reinventing itself rapidly, inspired by PM Modi’s call to you “Reform, Perform and Transform”.

I urge each one of you to keep learning and improve your skills. Be lifelong learners.

Universities, higher education institutions must work with corporate firms and other industries to make students familiar with the skills required for the 21st-century technology-dependent job market.

We must build the required infrastructure for skilling existing and new entrants to the labor force. Here I would urge the Industry and Industry bodies such as FICCI, ASOCHAM, and others to play a more pro-active role in creating skilled manpower for various sectors.

I would also call upon every institution providing higher education to have a dedicated department to promote skills and entrepreneurship. Such a department must empower students to seek opportunities in entrepreneurship as well.

Thank you!

Jaihind!

                Observing that connectivity was key to make India a developed country, the Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today called for developing infrastructure on par with the highest international standards, particularly in providing rail, road, air and port connectivity and improving the service delivery to the people.

Speaking after flagging off Gudur-Vijayawada Inter-City Super Fast Express at Gudur Railway Station, Shri Naidu stressed the need to step up investments to strengthen and modernize the infrastructure--be it railways, airways, ports, airports, inland waterways, rural roads, warehouses, transport, rural roads and cold storage units among others.

Shri Naidu also dedicated to the nation the electrification of Venkatachalam-Obulavaripalle railway line, India’s longest electrified rail tunnel( 6.6 km between Cherlopalli and Rapuru) and remodelled yard at Gudur Railway station and inaugurated new platforms (4 & 5) and second foot over bridge at Gudur railway stations.

Pointing out that India was the fastest growing major economy in the world, the Vice President said that an ambitious plan to build next-generation infrastructure including 100 Smart Cities, 10 green-field airports, 7 high-speed train corridors, 5 major ports, highways, inland water ways, rural roads, warehouse and cold storage chains and nation-wide broadband connectivity linking our villages and urban areas was underway.

“These programs will vastly improve connectivity, and prove as catalysts for industrialization and to take our trade and investment to a new level”, he added.

Under the Bharatmala Pariyojana, about 60,000 km of National Highways were being built. As many as 111 rivers have been identified as National Waterways. Apart from modernizing our railways, new metros in the urban centres and dedicated freight corridors were being built.

Expressing his happiness that railway stations were being modernised in a phased manner and that about 500 stations were taken up for redevelopment through PPP model, Shri Naidu said that the PPP model should be adopted wherever necessary.

The Vice President hailed the bullet train as a visionary project which will herald a new era of safety, speed and service for the people and help Indian Railways become an international leader in scale, speed and skill.

Shri Naidu described India's first high-tech, energy-efficient train, the Vande Bharat Express as a prime example of the success of Make in India programme.

Referring to the BharatNet project, he said that about 2.5 Lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country were being connected through high-speed Optic fibre cable network and called for creating a digital society to empower the people. 

He said the new Inter City Super Fast Express between Gudur and Vijayawada fulfills a long-cherished dream of the people of the region and would provide comfortable day journey at an affordable price.

He said the series of developmental initiatives undertaken by the Railways would not only boost the rail infrastructure and passenger facilities in Andhra Pradesh but would also help in boosting the socio-economic growth of this region.

Shri Naidu said the new rail line between Venkatachalam and Obulavaripalli would help in faster movement of freight and reduces distance and the travel time by at least 5 hours. 

Shri Naidu also appreciated the Indian Railways for creating large scale employment and contributing to economic development in the country through various projects. The railways was playing a major role in promoting tourism in the country, he added.

The Minister of State for Railways, Shri Suresh Angadi, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy, the Minister for Irrigation, Andhra Pradesh, Shri P. Anil Kumar Yadav and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the 56th Convocation of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras today.

Addressing the gathering Prime Minister said, “In front of me is both a mini-India and the spirit of New India. There is energy, vibrancy and positivity. I could see dreams of the future in your eyes. I could see the destiny of India in your eyes”. Congratulating the parents and teachers of the graduating students, PM also lauded the support staff. “I also want to highlight the role of the support staff. The silent, behind the scenes people who prepared your food, kept the classes clean, kept the hostels clean”.  

PM said that there is confidence in the abilities in the young people of India. ""During my visit to the U.S., in our discussions there was one thread common. It was optimism about New India. The Indian community has made a mark for itself all over the world, especially in science, technology and innovation. Who is powering this? Lot of them are your IIT seniors. You are making Brand India stronger globally”.

""Today as India is aspiring to become a 5 billion dollar economy, your innovation and aspiration of technology will fuel this dream. It will become the bedrock of India to become the most competitive economy. India's innovation is a great blend of economics and utility”.

We have worked to create a robust ecosystem for research and innovation in our country.  Atal Incubation Centres are being  created in many institutions. The next step is to find a market for the startups, PM added.

PM exhorted, ""Your hard work made the impossible possible. There are many opportunities awaiting you, not all of them are easy. Never stop dreaming, keep challenging yourself. That way you will become a better version of yourself”.

PM urged, ""No matter where you work, where you live, do also keep in mind, the needs of your motherland, your Mother India. Think of how your work, research, innovation will help your motherland. It is also your social responsibility”.

""Today, as a society, we want to move beyond single use plastics. What can be an environmentally friendly replacement that offers similar use but not similar disadvantages? This is when we look towards our young innovators like you. When technology comes together with data science, diagnostics, behavioural science and medicine, interesting insights can emerge”, PM added. 

""There are two types of people- those who live and those who exist."" Quoting Swami Vivekananda, PM said that those who live for others live a happy and fulfilled life.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded his address by adding that education and learning is a continuous process. He requested the students to continue learning and exploring even after leaving the institute.

Panneerselvam ji, Chairman, IIT Madras, Members of the Board of Governors, Director, Faculty of this great Institution, Distinguished guests, and, my young friends who are standing on the threshold of a golden future,It is a great pleasure to be here today.

Friends,

In front of me is both a mini-India and the spirit of New India. There is energy, vibrancy and positivity. As I was awarding the degrees to you, I could see dreams of the future in your eyes. I could see the destiny of India in your eyes.

Friends,

I want to congratulate the parents of those graduating. Imagine their pride and joy. They have struggled, they have sacrificed to bring you to this juncture in your lives. They have given you your wings, so that you can take flight. This pride is also reflected in the eyes of your teachers.  They have created, through their untiring efforts, not just good engineers but also good citizens.

I also want to highlight the role of the support staff. The silent, behind the scenes people who prepared your food, kept the classes clean, kept the hostels clean. In your success, they too have a role to play.Before moving on, I urge my student friends to rise and applaud your teachers, parents and support staff with a standing ovation.

Friends,

This is a remarkable institution. I am told that here, the mountains move and the rivers are stationary. We are in the state of Tamil Nadu, which has a special distinction. It is home to one of the oldest languages in the world- Tamil. And, it is home to one of the newest languages in India- the IIT-Madras language. There is a lot that you will miss. You will surely miss Saarang and Shaastra. You will miss your wing-mates. And there are something you will not miss. Most notably, you can now buy top quality footwear without any fear.

Friends,

You are indeed fortunate.  You are passing out of such a fantastic college at a time when the world is looking at India as a land of unique opportunities.  I have just returned home after a weeklong tour of the United States of America.  During this visit, I met many Heads of State, business leaders, innovators, entrepreneurs, investors.  In our discussions, there was one thread common.  It was - optimism about new India. And, confidence in the abilities of the young people of India.

Friends,

The Indian community has made a mark for itself all over the world. Especially in science, technology and innovation. Who is powering this? Lot of them are your IIT seniors. Thus, you are making Brand India stronger globally. These days, I interact with young officers clearing the UPSC exam. The number of IIT graduates will surprise both you and me! Thus, you are also making India a more developed place. And, go to the corporate world and you will see many many who studied in IIT. Thus, you are also making India more prosperous.

Friends,

I see the foundations of the 21st century resting on three crucial pillars of innovation, teamwork and technology. Each of these compliment each other.

Friends,

I just came from the Singapore-India Hackathon. There innovators from India and Singapore working together. They were finding solutions to common challenges. All of them devoted their energies towards one direction. These innovators came from different backgrounds. Their experiences were different. But all of them must create solutions that help not only those in India and Singapore but also to the world. This is the power of innovation, team work and technology. It benefits not a select few but everyone.

Today, India is inspiring to become a 5 trillion dollar economy.  Your innovation, aspiration and application of technology will fuel this dream. It become bedrock of India’s big leap into the most competitive economy.

Friends,

IIT Madras is a prime example of how a decades old institution can transform itself to meet the needs and aspirations of the 21st century.  A little while ago, I visited the research park established on Campus. This is the first such effort in the country.  I saw an extremely vibrant start up ecosystem today. I was told, that so far, about 200 start-ups have been incubated here.  It was my good fortune to see some of them.  I saw efforts in electric mobility, internet of things, health care, Artificial intelligence and more. All these start-ups should create unique Indian brands which will make their places in the world markets in future.

Friends,

India’s innovation is a great blend of Economics and Utility. IIT Madras is born in that tradition. Here the students and researchers take up the toughest problems and come up with a solution that is accessible and workable for all. I am told students here intern with start-ups, write codes from their rooms and that too without food or sleep.  Except for the hungry and no sleep part, I hope that spirit of innovating and pursuing excellence continues in the times to come.

Friends,

We have worked to create a robust ecosystem for innovation, for incubation for research and development in our country.  Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, State of the art technologies are now all being introduced to students much earlier in schools now. We are working to create Atal Tinkering Labs all over the country. 

Once the student comes to an institution like yours and wants to work on innovations, there are Atal Incubation Centres being created in many institutions that will support them. The next challenge is to find a market; to develop a start-up.  The start-up India Programme is designed to help you meet this challenge. This programme will support innovations to find their way to the market.  In addition, in order to promote research and development in the country, we have created the Prime Minister’s Research Fellow Scheme.

Friends,

It is the result of these untiring efforts that India is today one of the top three start-up friendly ecosystems.  You know what is the best part of India’s strides in start-ups? That this rise is powered by people from Tier-2, Tier-3 cities and even rural India. In the world of start-ups, the language you speak matters far less than the language you can code in. The power of your surname does not matter. You have the opportunity to create your own name. What matters is your merit.

Friends,

Do you remember when you first began to prepare for the IITs? Remember how tough things looked. But, your hard work made the impossible into possible. There are many opportunities awaiting you, not all of them easy. But, what today looks impossible is only waiting for your first step to seem within reach. Do not be bogged down. Break things down in steps. As you move from one step to another, you will see the problem unraveling in front of you bit by bit. The beauty of human endeavor lies in possibilities. So, never stop dreaming and keep challenging yourself. That way you will keep evolving and becoming a better version of oneself.

Friends,

I know that there are great, attractive opportunities waiting for you when you step out of this Institution. Make use of them. I have, however, a request to make of all of you.  No matter where you work, no matter where you live do also keep in mind the needs of your Motherland, India.  Think of how your work, innovations and your research could help a fellow Indian.  Not only is this your social responsibility, it also makes immense business sense. 

Can you find most cost-effective and innovative ways to recycle water used in our homes, offices, industry, so that our fresh water extraction and use is reduced?  Today, as a society, we want to move beyond single use plastics. What can be an environmentally friendly replacement that offers similar use but not similar disadvantages? This is when we look towards our young innovators like you.

Many of the diseases that affect a large section of the population in the near future will not be the traditional contagious diseases. It will be lifestyle diseases such as hyper-tension, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, stress. With the field of data science maturing and with the presence of data around these diseases, technologists can find a way to find patterns in them.

When technology comes together with data science, diagnostics, behavioural science and medicine, interesting insights can emerge. Are there things that can be done to reverse their spread? Are there patterns that we need to be wary of? Can technology answer these questions? Will IIT students take this up?

I speak about fitness and healthcare, because high achievers like you may run a risk of neglecting your own health because you are so immersed in work. I urge you to be active participants in the Fit India Movement both by focusing on personal fitness and by furthering innovation in health care.

Friends,

We have seen that there are two types of people, those who live and those who merely exist. It is for you to decide, do you want to exist or do you want to live life to the fullest? Consider a bottle of a medicine well passed its expiry date. Perhaps even a year passed its expiry date. The bottle exists. Perhaps the packaging also looks attractive. The medicine inside also still exists, but what is its use, can life be like this. Life should be lively and purposeful. And the best recipe for living a full life is to know , to learn, to understand and to live for others.

As Vivekananda rightly said, “They alone live who live for others”

Friends,

Your convocation ceremony indicates the conclusion of your current course of study. But it is not the end of your education.  Education and learning is a continuous process.  As long as we live, we learn. I wish you all, again, a bright future, dedicated to the good of humanity. Thank you. Thank you very much.

                Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi gave away Prizes to the winners of the 36 Hour Singapore India hackathon which concluded at IIT Chennai today.

The Hackathon the second such one was organised in collaboration with Government of Singapore, Government of India, IIT Chennai and the Nanyang Technical University (NTU), Singapore.

The First Hackathon was organised based on the idea mooted by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi at NTU,Singapore in 2018.

Addressing the students and academic fraternity, the Prime Minister congratulated the winners of the hackathon.

“Friends, I congratulate the winners of the hackathon. And, I congratulate each and every young friend assembled here, particularly my student friends. Your willingness to confront challenges and find workable solutions, your energy, your enthusiasm is of much greater value than just winning a competition“.

The Prime Minister said that India is among the top 3 Startup Friendly ecosystems.  He said India had given great emphasis to innovation and incubation in the last five years.

“Programmes like Atal Innovation Mission, PM Research Fellowships, Start-up India Abhiyan are the foundation of 21st century India, an India that promotes a culture of innovation.  We are now trying to give exposure to modern technology like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain to our students as early as in 6th grade.  From school to research in higher education, an ecosystem is being created that becomes a medium for innovation.”

Urging the students to find easy solutions to the problems being faced by India, the Prime Minister said that India would like to offer its solutions to the entire globe and especially the poorest of the nations.

“We are encouraging Innovation and Incubation for two big reasons, One is - we want easy solutions to solve India's problems, to make life easier. And another, we, in India want to find solutions for the whole world.  Indian Solutions for Global Application - this is our goal and our commitment. We would also like our cost effective solutions to be available to serve the needs of the poorest countries - Indian innovation in support of the poorest and the most deprived, no matter where they live.”

Prime Minister will also be attending the diamond jubilee celebrations and convocation ceremony of IIT-M.

                Friends,

 

You have been working non-stop for the last 36 hours to solve challenging problems.

 

Hats off to your energy. I do not see fatigue, only and only freshness.

 

I see satisfaction of a task well-accomplished. I think this sense of satisfaction comes also from Chennai’s special breakfast – Idli, Dos, Vada-Sambar.  The hospitality offered by the city of Chennai is extraordinary in its warmth. I am confident that everybody here, particularly our visitors from Singapore, must have enjoyed Chennai.

 

Friends, I congratulate the winners of the hackathon. And, I congratulate each and every young friend assembled here, particularly my student friends. Your willingness to confront challenges and find workable solutions, your energy, your enthusiasm is of much greater value than just winning a competition.  

 

My young friends, here we have solved many problems today. I specially like the solution about cameras to detect who is paying attention. And now what will happen you know, I will talk to my speaker in the Parliament. And am sure it will be very useful to the parliamentarians. 

 

For me, each of you is a winner. You are winners because you are not afraid of taking risks. You are committed to your efforts without worrying about the results.       

 

I will also take this opportunity to specially thank Mr. Ong Ye Kung, Education Minister, Govt. of Singapore and Nanyang Technical University (NTU) for extending help and support to make the India-Singapore Hackathon a grand success. 

 

From the Indian side, the Innovation Cell of the Ministry of Human Resource development, IIT-Madras and the All India Council for Technical Education have all done a fantastic job to ensure that the 2nd edition of India-Singapore Hackathon is extremely successful.

 

Friends,

 

There are few things as satisfying as seeing an effort one is associated from the very beginning become vibrant and successful.

 

I had suggested this idea of a Joint Hackathon during a previous visit to Singapore. Last year, this was organised in Nanyang Technical University in Singapore. This year it is being organised in the historic, yet modern Campus of IIT, Madras. 

 

Friends,

I have also been told that last year, the focus of the hackathon was competition. This time each team consists of students of both countries who have worked together to solve problems. So it can be safely said we have moved from competition to collaboration. 

This is the strength that we need, to bear jointly, on the challenges that both our countries face. 

 

Friends,

      Hackathons like this are great for youngsters. Participants get access to state of the art technology for the solution of global problems. And, they have to do it in a time frame.

Participants can test their ideas, their Innovative Skills. And, I firmly believe that the solutions found in today’s hackathons are the start-up ideas for tomorrow. 

We in India have been doing the Smart India Hackathon for the last few years. 

This initiative brings together Government Departments, people associated with Industry, and all premier Institutes. 

We incubate, fund and handhold solutions from the Smart India hackathon and try converting them into start-ups. 

 

On similar lines, I hope that NTU, MHRD and AICTE will jointly explore the possibility of creating ventures on ideas from this joint Hackathon. 

 

Friends,

 

     Today India is poised to grow into a Five Trillion dollar economy.  

For that Innovation and start-ups will play a crucial role. 

Already, India is among the Top Three Start-up Friendly Ecosystems. During the last five years, we have given great emphasis to encourage Innovation and Incubation. 

Programmes like Atal Innovation Mission, PM Research Fellowships, Start-up India Abhiyan are the foundation of 21st century India, an India that promotes a culture of innovation.

       We are now trying to give exposure to modern technology like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain to our students as early as in 6th grade.  

From school to research in higher education, an ecosystem is being created that becomes a medium for innovation.

Friends,

      We are encouraging Innovation and Incubation for two big reasons, One is - we want easy solutions to solve India's problems, to make life easier. And another, we, in India want to find solutions for the whole world.

      Indian Solutions for Global Application - this is our goal and our commitment.

We would also like our cost effective solutions to be available to serve the needs of the poorest countries - Indian innovation in support of the poorest and the most deprived, no matter where they live.

Friends, I genuinely believe that technology unites people, even across countries, across continents. I welcome the suggestions of Minister Ong. 

 

Let me take this opportunity to propose a similar Hackathon involving those Asian countries that may be interested in participating, with support from NTU, Government of Singapore and Government of India. 

 

Let best brains in Asian countries compete to offer innovative solutions for reducing ‘Global Warming and Climate Change’.    

 

To conclude, I once again congratulate all the participants and organizers for making this initiative a grand success. 

 

You are in Chennai, which offers rich culture, great heritage and food. I request all participants, especially our friends from Singapore, to enjoy their stay in Chennai. Take this opportunity to visit places like Mahabalipuram which is famous for its stone carvings and stone temples. They are classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

 

Thank you! Thank you very much!

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Chennai to take part in the 56th Convocation of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. He addresses the media at Chennai International Airport.

Speaking on the occasion, the PM said that this is my first visit to Chennai after the General Elections of 2019. I have come to attend the Diamond Jubilee Celebrations of IIT Madras, but I am highly indebted to all of you for coming in such large numbers to welcome me.

When I spoke in Tamil to the Indian Community in America during my recent visit and told that Tamil is the oldest language in the World it was widely reported in all the media in the USA, he added.

He said that during my visit to the USA, I realised that the World is looking up to India with great expectations and that the expectation is increasing by the day. Now it is our responsibility to not only make India a great nation but also to see to it that it meets the expectations of the World community.

Shri Modi said that this cannot merely be done by the Union Government it can happen only through the 130 Crore Indians. It can happen only with effort of every Indian in every nook and corner of the country, either rich or poor, either rural or urban, young or old.

He said that we have achieved many a success through Public Participation and in the same way we should rid the country of the Single Use Plastic. Some people by mistake are misinterpreting that I wanted India to be rid of Plastic, I did not say so, What I said was that I want the country should be rid of Single Use Plastic. This plastic can be used only once and it creates a lot of problems later.

On 2nd October, the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi we shall take up a Padyatra, and shall spread the ideals of Gandhi through these padyatras, he added.

He said, “I once again thank you for coming in such large numbers to welcome me”.

He will also address the Singapore India Hackathon 2019 at the IIT-M Research Park and will visit the startups at the pavilion there. He will deliver the Convocation address at the institutes’s Students Activity Centre.

                My dear countrymen, Namaskar, Friends, in today’s episode of Mann Ki Baat, I shall also talk about a great personality of the country, cherished by all Indians with respect and affection from the core of their hearts. There must be hardly an Indian citizen who does not show deep regard for her, does not revere her. She is elder to most of us and has been a witness to myriad phases, different eras the country has passed through. We address her as “DIDI”, elder sister…. Lata Didi. She turns ninety this 28th of September. Before leaving on the foreign tour, I was blessed with an opportunity to converse with her on the phone. This chat was akin to a younger brother speaking to his elder sister affectionately. I usually refrain from sharing such personal conversations; but today, I want you to listen to the tete a tete; listen to Lata Didi. Listen to it for yourself how Lata Didi is earnestly concerned and eager about everything concerning the country. Her satisfaction and reassurance too, lies in the progress being made by India; India on the path of change; the India that is gaining newer heights.           


                                     CONVERSATION WITH LATA MANGESHKAR


Modi Ji            :           Lata Didi, Pranaam. This is Narendra Modi

speaking. 

 

Lata Didi:        Pranaam.

 

Modi Ji            :           I gave you a call, since on your birthday this

time, I would be travelling on a flight.

 

Lata Didi:        Okay. 

 

Modi Ji            :           So, I thought, before leaving, I would wish you in 

advance… heartiest best wishes on your birthday. May you stay healthy, may your blessings always be showered upon us, we pray. And I called you up before leaving to greet you.

 

Lata Didi:        I was touched when I came to know that you 

would be giving me a call. When are you returning?

 

Modi Ji            :           I am returning in the intervening night of the 28th 

& the 29th, slightly past your birthday. 

 

Lata Didi:        Okay, Okay. What’s there to celebrate on a 

Birthday! Just at home with near & dear ones.

 

Modi Ji            :           Didi, you see….

 

Lata Didi:        I seek your blessings.

 

Modi Ji            :           It is we who seek your blessings, you are much 

elder to us. 

 

Lata Didi:        There are many who are elder just by age, but 

greater are the blessings of those who do great work, and hence are greater.

 

Modi Ji            :           Didi, you are greater, not only in terms of age, 

but also, in terms of your illustrious work. Your attainment through your glorious achievements are the result of your perseverance, your Sadhana & Tapasya. 

 

Lata Didi:        All this is just the fruit of the blessings of my 

parents; the blessings of my listeners. I am a nobody.

 

Modi Ji            :           That is your humility. For everyone from the new 

generation, it is a lesson. For us it is an immense source of inspiration that even after reaching glorious heights, you have always accorded the highest priority to acknowledge the upbringing, the sanskar bestowed by your parents and also to being humble.   

 

Lata Didi:        Jee…

 

Modi Ji            :           And it gives me joy when you proudly say that 

your mother was a Gujarati.

 

Lata Didi:        Yes.

 

Modi Ji            :           And whenever I visited you, you offered me a 

variety of Gujarati dishes.

 

Lata Didi         :           You do not have an idea of what you are. I know 

for sure that your advent is transforming the 

landscape of India. It gives me joy, feels nice.

 

Modi Ji            :           Didi, all we want is that you continue blessing us, 

blessing the whole country, may we keep on doing the good work. I keep getting your letters and gifts as well. Our close bond feels like family and gives me immense joy.

 

Lata Didi:        Of course. I do not wish to trouble you further, 

since I can see how busy you are with myriad pressures on the work front. There are so many things that you have to think of. After you had gone to touch your mother’s feet, I too sent someone to her to seek her blessings.

 

Modi Ji            :           Yes. My mother remembered. She was telling me 

that. 

 

Lata Didi:        And she blessed me over the telephone. I felt 

overjoyed.

 

Modi Ji            :           Your affection made Mother very happy. And I 

am extremely thankful to you for the concern that you show towards me. Once again, I extend my heartiest wishes for your birthday. This time when I had come to Mumbai, I felt like meeting you in person. 

 

Lata Didi:        Yes, certainly.

 

Modi Ji            :           But I could not be there because of paucity of 

time. But I shall come very soon to your place. And I would love you to feed me a Gujarati dish.

 

Lata Didi:        Of course, sure. I shall feel fortunate & 

privileged.

 

Modi Ji            :           Pranaam, Didi.

 

Lata Didi:        Pranaam.

 

Modi Ji            :           Lots of good wishes to you 

 

Lata Didi:        Greetings to you.

 

Modi Ji            :           Pranaam Didi.

 

My dear countrymen, with the advent of Navaratri today, the air is bound to be full of new hopes, new energy, newer zest and newer resolves, once again. After all, it’s the festival season. The ensuing weeks shall be witness to the sparkle of festivals throughout the country. All of us shall celebrate the Navaratri Mahotsava, Garba, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali, Bhaiya Dooj, Chhath Puja…. in fact, innumerable festivals. Heartiest greetings to all of you for these festivals to come. During festivals, families come together. Homes will be filled with joy! But… you must have felt this… there are many people around us who remain deprived of these celebrations. And this is what is termed as “Chirag Tale Andhera”, darkness just beneath the lamp!  Perhaps this adage is not just a set of words; for us, it is an order a philosophical thought, or an inspiration. Just think about it; there are some homes, bathed in shimmering lights; on the other hand, just close by, there are some homes mired in darkness. There are homes where sweetmeats are left to rot; there are homes where children yearn for a sweet; at places almirahs run out of space to store more clothes; elsewhere, people have to slog to earn a decent covering for their bodies. So, is this not the darkness, just beneath the lamp? Indeed, it is. The true joy radiating out of festivals is only when the darkness subsides and dissipates and a radiant glow emerges. Let us distribute joy, where there is a paucity of it… let it come naturally to us. On the one hand, when we experience the ‘Delivery In’ of sweetmeats, apparel, gifts and so on, let us think for a moment on the process of ‘Delivery Out’. At least in our homes, items that are in excess and thus, not required anymore, could be allocated for ‘Delivery Out’.  In many cities, many NGOs run by young friends have formed Startups for this endeavor. They collect clothes, sweets, food from homes, look for the needy and hand them over discreetly. Can we, this time, during the festival season, dispel some of the darkness beneath the lamp with due awareness and resolve? The smiles thus accrued on the faces of numerous underprivileged families will more than double your joy during festivals… your faces will be lit up with a glow that will brighten your Diwali immensely.

My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi, the goddess of wealth, makes an entry into each and every household in the form of fortune and prosperity. Of course, Laxmi should be welcomed in the traditional way. Can we, this time, introduce a novelty in welcoming her? In our culture, daughters are considered Laxmi, since they are harbinger of fortune and prosperity. Can we, this time around in society, organize programmes to felicitate daughters in villages, towns and cities? It could be in the form of a public function. There must be numerous daughters amongst us who, through there perseverance, diligence and talent have brought glory to their families, society and the country. This Diwali, can we arrange programmes to honor the Laxmi of India? If you look around, you’ll find many daughters and daughters-in-law who are performing extraordinarily. Some must be engaged in teaching underprivileged children, others could be occupied in spreading awareness in the field of sanitation and health, while many could be doing society a service by working as Doctor and Engineers. Or striving for justice to someone by working as Lawyer! 

Our society must recognize such daughters, honor them and feel proud of them. Programmes to felicitate them should be held throughout the country. We could do something more; we could highlight the achievements of these daughters by sharing their achievements on social media, using the hashtag # BHARAT KI LAXMI. The way we jointly ran a mega campaign “Selfie with daughter”, which spread globally. Similarly, this time, let us do a campaign BHARAT KI LAXMI. Encouraging the Laxmi of Bharat amounts to strengthening the paths of prosperity for the country and her citizens. 

My dear countrymen, as I have mentioned earlier, a great advantage of Mann Ki Baat is that, I’m blessed with the opportunity to converse with a lot of people, known or unknown, directly or indirectly. 

A few days ago, Aleena Taayang, a student from far off Arunachal has written an interesting letter to me. And the contents are… Let me read out the letter to you.

Respected Mr. Prime Minister, my name is Aleena Taayang. I hail from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh. On my exam result this time, some people asked me if I had read the book Exam Warriors! I replied in the negative. But on returning, I purchased the book and read it more than twice. My experience after that has been very good. I felt, had I read the book before my exams, I would have benefited a great deal. I liked quite a few aspects of this book, but I noticed that it contains may mantras for students, but for parents and teachers, this book does not have much. I wish;if you are thinking anew on a new edition, do include a few mantras for parents and teachers and of course new content.   

See… even my young friends bear this trust that whatever they ask the Pradhan Sevak, the principal servant of the country to do; it will be done.

My young student friends, first of all, I thank you for writing to me. Thank you for reading Exam Warriors more than twice and special thanks for pointing out shortcomings in the book. At the same time, my little friend has entrusted me with a task, in fact there are orders for me. I shall certainly comply with your directions. As you have told me, I shall positively try to write something for parents as well as teachers, as and when I get the time to pen a new edition. But I urge all of you… can you be of help to me? It is about experiences in your daily lives. I call upon all students, teachers and parents to come up with your experiences and suggestions on aspects of stress free exams. I shall duly go through them, study them. I’ll give it due thought and whatever comes across as apt, I shall try and incorporate that in my own words. And quite possibly, if the suggestions are sufficiently large in number, it will lend certitude to the idea of a new edition. So, I shall eagerly wait for your thoughts to flow. Once again, I express my gratitude to our little friend, student Aleena Taayang from Arunachal.

My dear countrymen, you update yourselves with the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and television, you even discuss the engagements. But, I hope you are aware that I am just as common a being as you are.  Being an ordinary citizen, whatever affects you has the same effect on me, since I’m just one amongst you. Just see how on the one hand, victory in the U.S. open was discussed; on the other, runner up Daniil Medvedev’s speech was equally doing the rounds in public discourse, especially on social media. Hence I too heard the speech and watched the match. The sheer simplicity and maturity displayed by the 23 year old Daniil Medvedev touched everyone. It surely stirred me. Moments before this speech, he had suffered defeat at the hands of Tennis legend Rafael Nadal, 19 times grand slam winner. An event such as this would have pushed anyone towards remorse and despair; in the case of Medvedev, there was no sign of the slightest pallor on his countenance. Rather, his expression lit up the faces of those watching him with meaningful smiles. He won hearts with his humility and simplicity; the epitome of the spirit of sportsmanship in the truest sense that he is, in letter and spirit. Spectators welcomed his reflections with warmth and fervor. He also touched upon Nadal being the inspiring force in Tennis for millions of young people, adding how difficult it was to face him in the game. The way Medvedev heaped praise on his opponent after a defeat in a fierce duel makes him a living example of the true essence of the spirit of sportsmanship. Of course, on the other hand champion Nadal too showered glowing praise on Daniil’s game. The display of the indomitable ardour of the defeated and the sheer humility of the victorious in the same frame was a sight to behold. If you haven’t heard Medvedev’s speech yet, I shall urge you, especially young friends to watch this video. It holds much for people across the age and class spectra to see and learn. These are moments that go way beyond winning and losing, where victory and defeat cease to be. It is life that is victory…. This has been beautifully articulated in our scriptures. The wisdom of our ancestors is truly praiseworthy. Our ancient texts observe: 

विद्या विनय उपेता हरति 

न चेतांसि कस्य मनुजस्य  

मणि कांचन संयोग: 

जनयति लोकस्य लोचन आनन्दम

meaning, when ability and humility amalgamate in a person, whose heart will he not be able to win over? As a matter of fact, this young player has won the hearts of people across the globe.

My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to tell you now is directly for your benefit. Discourses and debates will continue, the support and opposition will continue, but, if some things are checked before they proliferate, then there is a huge benefit. Things that spawn and spread a lot are very difficult to stop at later stages. But, if we become aware at an early stage and put a stop to it, then a lot can be saved. Continuing in the same vein, I feel, today, that I should definitely have a talk with my young friends.

We all know that addiction to tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit this addiction. People who consume tobacco are vulnerable to high risk diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure etc. Everyone knows that. Tobacco intoxication occurs due to the nicotine present in it. Brain development is hampered by its consumption during adolescence. But, today, I want to have a discourse with you on a new topic. You must be knowing that, recently the e-cigarette got banned in India. An e-cigarette is a type of electronic device unlike a typical cigarette. In an e-cigarette, the heating of nicotine-containing fluids creates a type of chemical smoke and this is the pathway through which nicotine is consumed. While we all understand the dangers of common cigarettes, a misconception has been generated about e-cigarettes.

The myth that has been spread is that e-cigarettes pose no danger. Like the conventional cigarette, it does not spread odour as fragrant chemicals are added to it. We have seen around us, that, even if the father in any house is a chain smoker, still he tries to stop the rest of the household from smoking and wants his children not to fall prey to the habit of cigarettes or bidis. His effort is that no family member should take to smoking. He knows that smoking or tobacco causes great damage to the body. There is no confusion about the dangers posed by a cigarette. It only causes harm and this even its seller too knows. The smoker also knows this fact and so do people around. But the case of e-cigarettes is quite different. There is little awareness among people about e-cigarette. They are also completely unaware of its danger and for this reason sometimes e-cigarettes sneak into the house out of sheer curiosity. And Kids at times pretending to be showing some magical trick, blow smoke in the presence of Peer Company or their parents, without lighting a cigarette or striking a match to light it! And as if a magic show is going on, the family members respond with applause! There is no awareness! There is no knowledge that once the teenagers or our youth get caught in its clutches, then, slowly, they become hooked and fall prey to this noxious addiction.

And our real wealth -the youth become condemned to tread on the path of waste, quite unaware! In fact, many harmful chemicals are added to e-cigarettes, which have a deleterious effect on health. You are aware of the fact that when someone smokes around us, we come to know about it through its odour. Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in someone’s pocket, the smell can be detected. However, this is not the case with an e-cigarette and many teenagers and young people, unknowingly and sometimes proudly displaying an e-cigarette as a fashion statement, keep it in  their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes hold it in their hands and thus fall prey to it. The younger generation is the future of our country. The e-cigarette has been banned so that this new form of intoxication does not destroy our demographically young country. It does not trample the dreams of a family and waste the lives of our children. This scourge and this obnoxious habit should not become rooted in our society.

I urge all of you to quit the addiction to tobacco and do not harbour any misconceptions about e-cigarettes. Come, let us all build a healthy India.

Oh Yes! Do you still remember Fit India? Fit India does not mean that if we go to the gym for two hours every morning and evening, it will suffice! All these addictions have to be avoided to be a part of Fit India. I am sure you will not misconstrue whatever I’ve said, but rather happily accept my counsel; I will definitely like it.

My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great providence that our India has been the birthplace and work-place of extraordinary denizens, who spent all their lives, not for themselves, but for the good of the society.

Our Mother India, our country is a bountiful land! Many gems of human beings took birth here. India has not only been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, but also the land of their karma. And these are the people who have spent themselves in service of others. One such illustrious Indian is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October. It is a matter of pride for every Indian that, on the coming 13thOctober, His Holiness Pope Francis will declare Sister MariamThresia a saint. Sister MariamThresia, in her short lifespan of 50 years, worked for the good of humanity becoming a noble example for the entire world. Whatever task Sister Mariam Thresia undertook and accomplished, she did so with utmost dedication and devotion.She rendered service in the fields of education and social service. She had built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and throughout her life, remained devoted to this cause.

She founded the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family which is still continuing on the path of her life’s philosophy and mission. I once again pay heartfelt tributes to Sister MariamThresia and congratulate the citizens of India, and especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.

My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world today, while we are celebrating ‘Gandhi 150’, our 130 crore countrymen have pledged to be rid from the menace of Single Use Plastic. In view of the kind of lead that India has taken towards environmental protection, today the countries of the entire world are looking towards India as a model example. I am confident that you will all be a part of the campaign for liberation from the menace of Single Use Plastic on 2ndOctober. In India, citizens are contributing in this campaign in their own way. But, a young man from our country has initiated a very unique campaign.

My attention was drawn towards his work, so I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand the new experiment being attempted by him. It could be that this attempt of his may work for other people of our country. Mr. Ripudaman Belviji is making a unique effort by attempting plogging! When I first encountered the term Plogging, it was novel even to me. Perhaps this word is in usage in certain measures in foreign lands. But, in India, Ripudaman Belviji has promoted it to a great extent. Let's talk to him.

 


	
		
			
			    PM’S PHONE CALL WITH RIPUDAMAN BELVI 
			
		
	


 

Modi ji: Hello Ripudaman ji, This is Narendra Modi speaking.

 

Ripudaman: Yes…yes sir. Thank you very much sir.

 

Modi ji: Ripudaman ji |

 

Ripudaman: Yes sir.

 

Modi ji: You are working in a quite dedicated manner with regards to this work termed as ‘plogging’!

 

Ripudaman: Yes sir.

 

Modi ji: So I was a bit curious, so I thought to myself to call and ask you.

 

Ripudaman: Ok

 

Modi ji: When did it? I mean this inspiration strike your mind?

 

Ripudaman: Yes sir.

 

Modi ji: When did this term…and this technique came to your mind?

 

Ripudaman: Sir, the youth of today wants something cool, you need something interesting

to motivate them, so I got motivated. If I had to involve 130 crores of Indians in this mission then I had to devise something interesting, so I myself am a runner, so in the morning when we run at time traffic is Less as well as the people. And therefore garbage and trash and plastic are most visible. Instead of cribbing and complaining I thought to do something about it! And I started with my running group at first in Delhi and then took it all over India! And got quite a lot of appreciation from everywhere...

Modi ji: What exactly did you do? Please explain a bit so that I can understand and through 'Mann Ki Baat' our Countrymen can also get to know.

Ripudaman: Sir, so we started ‘Run & Clean-up

Movement,' where in our running groups after their workout, during their cool down activity period we said that you start collecting trash, and start lifting your own plastics yourself start lifting plastics! As you are running as well as you're cleaning-up at the same time, hence lots of exercise was getting added up! So you're not just running but are also doing squats, doing deep squats, you are doing lunges, because you are bending forward! So it became a holistic work out. And You will be happy to know that last year in all fitness magazines it has been nominated as ‘Top fitness trend of India’...This Fun (filled activity)...

 

Modi ji: I congratulate you on this.

 

Ripudaman: Thank you sir.

 

Modi ji: So now you plan to start from Kochi from 5th September?

 

Ripudaman: Yes sir, the name of this mission is 'R  Elan, Run to make India Litter Free,' like you are going to deliver a historic verdict on 2nd October - and I am sure if we’ll be garbage free then we will also be free from plastic and that it will become an individual responsibility. So, I am running and cleaning-up a thousand kilometres covering 50 cities. It is being said said that this is probably the world's longest clean-up drive and in addition we will have begun a very cool sir, usage of social media at # (Hashtag) plasticUpvaas where we are telling people that they tell us which single thing, single use anything, not just single use plastic but single use anything that you will completely rid from your life!

Modi ji: Wah! ... what has been your experience since you’ve been out from 5th September till now?

Ripudaman: Sir, it has been a very good experience so far. From last two years, we have done around 300 plogging drives all over India. So when we started from Kochi and then the running groups joined, the local clean-ups were also added.  After Kochi,  Madurai, Coimbatore, Salem we have just been in Udupi

Where we got a school invitee, small children, Sir, from 3rd standard to 6th standard, were to be given a workshop for half an hour for which they called me. And that half-hour workshop became a three hours Plogging Drive! Sir, because these kids are so enthusiastic that they wanted to do this and they wanted to take it back and tell their parents, tell their peers,  their neighbors! That it becomes a big motivation for us to take it to the next level!

Modi ji: Ripu ji this is not a mere toil, it is a penance. You’re performing penance really!

 

Ripudaman: Yes sir.

 

Modi ji: I congratulate you very much. But if you were to tell three things to the countrymen.

So what specific three advice would they be?

Ripudaman: I would really like to give three steps. For a litter free India! Towards a Garbage Free India! Step number one Deposit litter in the dustbin only. Step number two any garbage you see, pick it up from the ground and deposit in the dustbin. Step number three if you don’t see a dustbin then take the litter in your pocket or in your car and carry it home!  Segregate it into Dry and Wet waste and in the morning when municipality van comes, you give it to them ! If we follow these three steps we will see a litter free India We will get an India free from garbage!

Modi ji: see Ripu ji in very simple words and simple language that an ordinary human being can also practice your advice, and you seem to be walking in step with Gandhiji's dream, as well as you have adopted to tell it in simple manner similar to the way Gandhiji used to do.

Ripudaman: Thank you.

That is why you are worthy of praise. Ripudaman ji, I felt nice talking to you. You have designed this entire programme in a very innovative manner, in a way that it will be liked, especially by young people. Heartiest congratulation to you. And friends this time on the anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports too is organizing a ‘Fit India Plogging Run’. On the 2nd of October, plogging for two kilometers; and it will be held across the country. We heard through the experiences of Ripudaman Ji, how this programme should be organised; what it should consist of. What we have to do in this campaign that commences on 2nd of October is that while we jog for 2 kilometers; and on the way, collect all kinds of plastic waste. Through endeavor, we shall not only pay better attention to our health; we shall also take a step towards ensuring protection for Mother Earth. This campaign is resulting in raising awareness levels in people; as far as sanitation and cleanliness, along with fitness levels. I do believe that a single step towards freedom from single use plastic taken by 130 crore countrymen will give India a lead by a 130 crore steps. Ripudaman ji, once again, many thanks to you. And to your team, and your imaginative, innovative bent of mind, heartiest congratulations from my side. Thank you.

 My dear countrymen, groundwork for 2nd October is going on all over the country and also the world over, but we want to transmute 'Gandhi 150' as a task on the path of our duty. We want to move forward devoting our lives in the interest of the nation. I would like to remind you one thing in advance. Although in the next episode of 'Mann Ki Baat' I shall dwell upon it in detail, still today I am telling this in advance so that you get time to prepare. You do remember that, 31stOctober is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and that ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ is our common dream; hence for that reason, every year on 31 October, we run for fostering unison in the country as 'Run for Unity', all over the nation. We have to run for the unity of the country on that day in in large numbers; elders, everyone, schools, colleges, all of us have to run for unity in lakhs of villages across the span of Hindustan. So, better start preparing from this instant onwards! I shall talk about it in detail later, but right now we have time on our hands; some people can begin their practice, whereas some can chalk out a plan.         

 My dear countrymen, you will remember, that on 15 August, I had in my address said from the ramparts of Red Fort that by 2022, you should visit 15 tourist destinations in India. At least 15 places and if possible, make a program to stay over there for an overnight, two-night stay. You should observe, understand and experience India. We have so much diversity. And when holidays come in the shape of Diwali and allied festivals, people do travel and that's why I urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.

My dear countrymen, the 27th of September, two days prior to today, was celebrated as World Tourism Day and you will be happy to know that certain reputed tourism agencies of the world which rank standards of travel & tourism have shown that India has displayed a lot of improvement in the Travel & Tourism Competitive Index. And all this has been possible due to your cooperation and especially because understanding the importance of tourism has increased. The Swachhata Abhiyan also has a big role to play in all of this. And you will be delighted to know that today our rank is thirty four on this index whereas five years ago we were ranked 65th, which in a way is a big jump. If we tried all that harder, then by the 75th year of our independence, we would have carved a place for ourselves amidst the major tourist destinations of the world.

My dear countrymen, once again, I wish you all the best for various festivals that will be celebrated in the oncoming season in India, which is filled with diversity! Yes! Also, please see to it that during the celebration of Diwali, firecrackers do not lead to incidents of fire or loss of a life. Whatever precautions or preventive care is to be taken, should be taken during Diwali. Happiness should co-exist with joy, and of course there must also be enthusiasm and our festivals do indeed bring the aroma of collectiveness, and also the rituals connected with communal harmony. Symbiotic living provides us with renewed vigour and the festive season is the symbol of the culmination of that renewed vigour. Come! Together brimming with enthusiasm, renewed dreams and resolutions we should celebrate. Once again here’s wishing many felicitations to you all. Thank you.

                Mr. President,                                                                     

I take the floor to exercise India’s right of reply to the statement made by the Prime Minister of Pakistan.                       



 


	Every word spoken from the podium of this august Assembly, it is believed, carries the weight of history. Unfortunately, what we heard today from Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan was a callous portrayal of the world in binary terms. Us vs Them; Rich vs Poor; North vs South; Developed Vs Developing; Muslims vs Others. A script that fosters divisiveness at the United Nations. ​Attempts to sharpen differences and stir up hatred, are simply put - “hate speech”.      


           


	Rarely has the General Assembly witnessed such misuse, rather abuse, of an opportunity to reflect. Words matter in diplomacy. Invocation of phrases such as “pogrom”, “bloodbath”, “racial superiority”, “pick up the gun” and “fight to the end” reflect a medieval mindset and not a 21st ​ century vision.


 


	Prime Minister Khan’s threat of unleashing nuclear devastation qualifies as brinksmanship, not statesmanship.


 


	Even coming from the leader of a country that has monopolized the entire value chain of the industry of terrorism, Prime Minister Khan’s justification of terrorism was brazen and incendiary.           


 


	For someone who was once a cricketer and believed in the gentleman’s game, today’s speech bordered on crudeness of the variety that is reminiscent of the guns of Darra Adam Khel.                                 
	Now that Prime Minister Imran Khan has invited UN Observers to Pakistan to verify that there are no militant organisations in Pakistan, the world will hold him to that promise.
	
		
		
			
			
				
				
					
					
						
						
							 
						
						
					
					
				
				
			
			
		
		
	
	
	Here are a few questions that Pakistan can respond to as a precursor to the proposed verification.                                               



	Can Pakistan confirm the fact that it is home to 130 UN designated terrorists and 25 terrorist entities listed by the UN, as of today?


 


	Will Pakistan acknowledge that it is the only Government in the world that provides pension to an individual listed by the UN in the Al Qaeda and Da’esh Sanctions list!


 


	Can Pakistan explain why here in New York, its premier bank, the Habib Bank had to shut shop after it was fined millions of dollars over terror financing?


 


	Will Pakistan deny that the Financial Action Task Force has put the country on notice for its violations of more than 20 of the 27 key parameters?


 


	And would Prime Minister Khan deny to the city of New York that he was an open defender of Osama bin Laden?


Mr. President,                                                                                                        


	Having mainstreamed terrorism and hate speech, Pakistan is trying to play its wild card as the newfound champion of human rights.


 


	This a country that has shrunk the size of its minority community from 23% in 1947 to 3% today and has subjected Christians, Sikhs, Ahmadiyas, Hindus, Shias, Pashtuns, Sindhis and Balochis to draconian blasphemy laws, systemic persecution, blatant abuse and forced conversions.


 


	Their newfound fascination for preaching human rights is akin to trophy hunting of the endangered mountain goat - markhor.


 


	Pogroms, Prime Minister Imran Khan Niazi, are not a phenomenon of today’s vibrant democracies. We would request you to refresh your rather sketchy understanding of history. Do not forget the gruesome genocide perpetrated by Pakistan against its own people in 1971 and the role played by Lt. Gen A A K Niazi. A sordid fact that the Hon’ble Prime Minister of Bangladesh reminded this Assembly about earlier this afternoon.                                      


Mr. President,


	Pakistan’s virulent reaction to the removal of an outdated and temporary provision that was hindering development and integration of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir stems from the fact that those who thrive on conflict never welcome the ray of peace.


 


	While Pakistan has ventured to upstream terrorism and downstream hate speech there, India is going ahead with mainstreaming development in Jammu and Kashmir.


 


	The mainstreaming of Jammu & Kashmir, as well as Ladakh, in India’s thriving and vibrant democracy with a millennia-old heritage of diversity, pluralism and tolerance is well and truly underway. Irreversibly so.


 


	Citizens of India do not need anyone else to speak on their behalf, least of all those who have built an industry of terrorism from the ideology of hate.


 

I thank you, Mr. President.

                Namaskar
Hon'ble Mr. Secretary,

It is a great honour for me to address the 74th Session of the United Nations on behalf of 1.3 billion Indians.

It is a very special occasion, also, because this year, the entire world is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

His message of truth and non-violence is very relevant for us even today, for peace , development and progress in the world.

Mr Secretary,

This year, the world’s biggest election took place. In the world’s biggest democracy , the highest ever number of voters voted me and my government into power for a second term with an even stronger mandate than before.

And it is thanks to this mandate that I am standing here before you once again.

However, the message that this mandate conveys has an even greater significance, a wider and more inspiring one.

Mr Secretary,

When a developing country is able to successfully implement the world’s biggest sanitation campaign, building over 110 million toilets in just 5 years for its countrymen, all its achievements and outcomes are an inspirational message for the entire world.

When a developing country, successfully runs the world’s biggest health insurance scheme, giving 500 million people the facility of an annual health cover of 500,000 Rs for free treatment; the achievements and responsive systems that result from this scheme show the world a new path.

When a developing country, successfully runs the world’s biggest financial inclusion scheme, opening over more than 370 million bank accounts for the poor in just 5 years, the systems that result, build confidence in the poor across the entire world.

When a developing country, launches for its citizens, the world’s biggest digital identification program, giving them a biometric identity , thereby ensuring they can avail their rights, and saves more than 20 billion dollars by checking corruption, the modern systems that result from it, give the world a new hope.

Mr Secretary,

As I came in here, on a wall at the entrance to this building, I noticed the sign, 'no more single use plastic' I am pleased to inform this assembly that even as I am addressing you today, a very large campaign is being implemented across the entire country to make India free of single use plastic.

In the next 5 years, apart from promoting water conservation, we are going to ensure water supply to 150 million homes.

In the next 5 years, we are going to build over 125,000 kilometers of new roads.

By the year 2022, when India celebrates its 75th Independence day, we plan to build 20 million houses for the poor.

Though the world may have set itself the target of eradicating TB by 2030, in India we are working towards eradicating it by 2025.

The question that arises is just how have we been able to achieve all of this. How is it that such rapid changes are taking place in India?

Mr. Secretary,

India is a great culture that is thousands of years old, a culture that has its own vibrant traditions, and which encompass universal dreams. Our values and culture see divinity in every being and strive for the inclusive welfare of all.

Therefore, The very core of our approach is public welfare through public participation and this public welfare is not just for India but for the entire world.

And that is the reason we draw inspiration from our motto : Collective efforts , for growth of all, with everyone’s trust (sabka sath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas).

And this too, is not confined within the borders of India.

Our endeavours, are neither an expression of pity, nor a pretense. They are inspired by a sense of duty, and duty alone.

All our endeavours, are centered on 1.3 billion Indians. But the dreams that these efforts are trying to fulfill, are the same dreams that the entire world has, that every country has, and that every society has.

The efforts are ours, but their fruits are for all, for the entire world.

And this conviction of mine, gets stronger every day, when I think of those countries, who, just like India, are striving for development, each in their own way.

When I hear about their joys and sorrows, when I get to know about their dreams, my resolve to develop my country at a faster pace gets even stronger, so that India’s experience can be beneficial to these countries.

Mr. Secretary,

3000 years ago, a great poet of India, Kariyan Pungun-dra-naar, wrote in Tamil the most ancient language of the world:

""Ya-dum, Oo-ray, Yaav-rum Ke-rir”

which means We belong to all places, and to everyone.

This sense of belonging beyond borders, is unique to India.

In the last 5 years, India has worked towards strengthening its centuries old great tradition of fraternity among nations and welfare of the world, which is indeed, in line with the key objectives of the United Nations.

The issues that India raises, the kind of new global platforms that India has come forward to build, seek collective efforts to address serious global challenges and issues.

Mr. Secretary,

If you look at it from a historic and per capita emission perspective, India’s contribution to Global Warming is very low.

However, India is one of the leading nations when it comes to taking steps to address this issue.

On one hand, we are working towards achieving the target of 450 Giga Watts of renewable energy, and on the other hand, we have also taken the initiative to create the International Solar Alliance.

One of the effects of Global Warming is the increasing number and severity of natural disasters, and at the same time they are appearing in new areas and in new forms.

In view of this, India has initiated the formation of the ""Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure” (CDRI). This coalition will help build infrastructure which can withstand natural disasters.

Mr. Secretary,

The largest number of sacrifices made by soldiers of any country for UN Peace keeping missions is from India.

We belong to a country, that has given the world, not war, but Buddha’s message of peace.

And that is the reason why, our voice against terrorism, to alert the world about this evil, rings with seriousness and the outrage.

We believe, that this is one of the biggest challenges, not for any single country, but for the entire world and humanity.

The lack of unanimity amongst us on the issue of terrorism, dents those very principles, that are the basis for the creation of the U.N.

And that is why, for the sake of humanity, I firmly believe, that it is absolutely imperative, that the world unites against terrorism, and that the world stands as one against terrorism.

Mr. Secretary

The face of the world is changing today.

Modern technology in the 21st Century, is bringing about sweeping changes in social life, personal life, economy, security, connectivity and international relations.

In such a situation, not a fragmented world, is in the interest of no one. Neither do we have the option to confine ourselves within our boundaries.

In this new era, we will have to give new direction and energy to Multilateralism, and to the United Nations.

Mr. Secretary,

One Hundred and Twenty Five years ago, the Great Spiritual Guru, Swami Vivekananda, gave this message to the world during the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago.

The message was, ""Harmony and Peace…. And NOT Dissension”.

Today, the message from the world’s largest democracy, for the International community is still the same: ""Harmony and Peace”.

Thank you Very much.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York today.

Evoking Mahatma Gandhi, Prime Minister said that Gandhiji’s message of truth and non-violence is relevant even today for peace, progress and development of the world.

Prime Minister highlighted the huge transformation brought about by the pro–people initiatives of the Government like Swachh Bharat, Ayushman Bharat, Jan Dhan Yojana and Digital identification (Aadhar). He added that when India pursues such initiatives, it instills hope in the entire world.

Prime Minister mentioned about India’s commitment towards eliminating single use plastic. He spoke about the government’s commitment to provide water to every household, a house for every family and elimination of tuberculosis in the coming five years.

Emphasizing on Indian culture, Prime Minister said public welfare is part of our cultural ethos. He said that public welfare through public participation is the mantra of his government. 

 In addition to fulfilling the dreams of 130 crore Indians, the efforts of the government will also be beneficial to the entire world. “We are working not just for the welfare of our people, but for the welfare of the entire world. That is why our motto is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’, PM added.

Terming terrorism as the biggest challenge for the world, Prime Minister urged all the nations to unite against terrorism for the sake of humanity. “India is a country that has given the world, not war, but Buddha's message of peace,'' the PM said. He also mentioned about India’s contribution to the United Nation peacekeeping Mission

Prime Minister urged the international community to give a new direction to multilateralism. He said as the world is going through a new era, the countries do not have the option to confine themselves within their boundaries. “A divided world is in no one's interest. We must give a thrust to multilateralism and reforming the United Nations,” the PM said.

Prime Minister invoked the quotes of Tamil philosopher Kaniyan Pungundranar and Swami Vivekananda to seek collective action to address various global challenges. He said that ‘Harmony and Peace’ is the message of the world’s largest democracy to the rest of the world.

Speaking about global warming, Prime Minister said that even though India’s contribution towards global warming in terms of per-capita emissions is very low, India is at the forefront of the response against it. In this context, he elaborated on the steps taken by his government to fight climate change, including the 450 GW of renewable energy target and the formation of International Solar Alliance.

                The Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Dr. P.K. Mishra, today addressed the gathering at the 15th Formation Day of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), at New Delhi. 

In his address, Dr. Mishra recalled his association with NDMA in its early days, and expressed satisfaction that NDMA's efforts and initiatives towards disaster management are being recognized widely. He appreciated NDMA for its role in forming a consensus with multiple partners and stakeholders to ensure that disaster risk reduction is integrated into our development activities at all levels.



Dr. P.K. Mishra described the launch of the guidelines on Disability-Inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction as a milestone in our path to resilience. He said this initiative delivers on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas’, and strives to make our risk reduction initiatives more inclusive by addressing the needs of one of the most vulnerable sections of our society.He observed that risk reduction is an ever-evolving process, and urged NDMA to continuously work to further improve its processes and interventions.

Talking about ""Fire Safety"", the theme for this year's Formation Day, he said that the subject has been in global focus recently, with incidents such as the devastating fire in the Amazon forests, and the Surat fire tragedy. In particular, he emphasized the need for fire risk mitigation planning in the urban areas. He said different kinds of fire - residential, commercial, rural, urban, forest fire, and industrial fire – all pose different challenges and dealing with each one of them requires specific strategies. He stressed on the need for adequate training and the right protective gear for firefighters.

The Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister asserted that all critical infrastructure, shopping complexes, commercial establishments and government buildings should be regularly audited for fire safety, and necessary preventive measures should be put in place on priority. 

He said that this is especially relevant for major cities, where adhering to municipal laws can prevent incidents like the one at Surat, where fire at a coaching centre in a commercial complex killed many students.



Dr. P.K. Mishra appreciated the efforts of the city of Mumbai, in incorporating the latest technology and equipment for fire prevention, mitigation and response. This includes drones, hand-held laser infra-red cameras, and remote-controlled robots equipped with thermal imaging cameras for firefighting operations. He urged other cities to emulate the Mumbai model. 

Noting that response times are very critical in case of fire accidents, he said that mobile fire stations, as developed in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Gurgaon, are an innovative way of reducing the response time. He said local administrations should collaborate with fire services and come up with solutions best-suited to their local contexts to increase the efficiency of response. 

Dr. P.K. Mishra drew attention to the fact that in the western world, fire services form the first line of response to any disaster or emergency. He said we should consider upgrading our fire services in a manner that firefighters become the first responders in case of any disaster or emergency, after the affected community itself. Regular mock drills coupled with massive awareness campaigns at the community level are needed to make fire safety everyone’s agenda, he added. 

He called upon NDMA to revisit and update its National Guidelines on Fire Services, released in 2012. 



In conclusion, he reiterated that fire safety is a concern for everyone and that we need to strive towards “Fire Safety for all.”

The gathering included senior officials of the NDMA, Union and State Governments, and representatives from State Disaster Management Authorities and Fire Services.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Prime Minister of New Zealand H.E. Ms. Jacinda Ardern on the sidelines of UNGA meetings in New York on 25th September 2019.



Both leaders reviewed the state of bilateral relations and discussed steps to intensify political, economic, defence, security and people to people relations. They recalled their earlier meeting in November 2017 in Manila and noted that following the visit of former Prime Minister of New Zealand to India in October 2016, new institutional mechanisms have been instituted, which has substantially enhanced the bilateral relationship. PM Modi thanked PM Ardern for accepting his invitation to participate in the event ""Relevance of Gandhi in the contemporary Times” held on the sidelines of UNGA on 24 September 2019.

 

The New Zealand PM informed PM Modi about their New strategic paper ""India 2022- Investing in the relationship”, which is a continuation of the NZ Inc. India Strategy 2011. PM Ardern noted that Indian diaspora and students in New Zealand is important bridge between the two nations and contributing to bonds of friendship between the two countries.

They also discussed the global and regional issues of mutual interest, including the issue of international terrorism and appreciated the convergence of views between the two countries on this issue. Both countries have strongly condemned and extended support to each other following the Pulwama and Christchurch terror attacks. India had also supported the joint New Zealand French initiative on Christchurch Call of Action.

                India’s historic and warm relations with the countries of the Caribbean witnessed a new momentum with the meeting of PM Modi with 14 leaders of the CARICOM group of countries on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2019 in New York. Hon’ble Allen Chastenet, Prime Minister of St Lucia and current Chairman of CARICOM co-chaired the meeting. The meeting was attended by the Hon’ble Heads of Governments of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Vice President of Suriname, and Foreign Ministers of Bahamas, Belize, Grenada, Haiti and Guyana.



It was the first-ever meeting of PM Modi with CARICOM leaders in a regional format and highlighted the steadily intensifying and deepening relations between India and partner countries of the Caribbean, not only in the bilateral, but also in the regional context. PM Modi reiterated India’s firm commitment to strengthen its political, economic and cultural engagement with CARICOM. He recalled the presence of more than a million-strong Indian diaspora as a vibrant and enduring link of friendship with the Caribbean.

 



The meeting deliberated on strengthening the political and institutional dialogue processes, boosting economic cooperation, increasing trade and investment and fostering greater and more robust people- to- people relations. PM Modi also laid emphasis on partnering with CARICOM countries in capacity building, development assistance and cooperation in disaster management and resilience. He invited CARICOM countries to join the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. PM expressed his condolences on the destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian in the region and the worst hit island of Bahamas to which India has provided immediate financial assistance of USD 1 million.

PM Modi announced a USD 14 million grant for community development projects in the CARICOM and another 150 million Line of Credit for solar, renewable energy and climate- change related projects. He also announced the setting up of the Regional Center for Excellence in Information Technology in Georgetown, Guyana and the Regional Vocational Training Center in Belize by upgrading the existing India-funded centers in these countries. The Indian side also expressed support to specialized capacity building courses, training and deputation of Indian experts based on the needs and requirements of the CARICOM countries. He invited a Parliamentary delegation from CARICOM to visit India in the near future.

 



CARICOM leaders welcomed the initiatives proposed by PM Modi to strengthen engagement and cooperation between the two sides and reassured full support from their respective governments.

It was decided to set up a Joint Task Force to expeditiously look into possible areas of cooperation and identify the way forward.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi delivered the keynote address at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York today.

Addressing the prestigious gathering, the Prime Minister said that he would use this opportunity to talk about the future direction of India’s growth story. The Prime Minister said that India’s growth story was built on four pillars, namely Democracy, Demography, Demand and Decisiveness. 

Prime Minister noted that the Indian economy has benefited from the climate of political stability in the country.

Prime Minister also highlighted global recognition of the successful reforms introduced by the Government. In this regard he mentioned the ten rank jump in the Logistics Performance Index, the thirteen point jump in the Global Competitiveness Index, the twenty four rank rise in Global Innovation Index; along side the sixty five rank improvement in the Ease of Doing Business index calculated by the World Bank.

Prime Minister also spoke of the Bloomberg National Brand Tracker 2018 survey that recently ranked India as the top performing Asian economy in attracting global investment. In 7 out of 10 indicators of this report i.e. political stability, currency stability, high quality products, anti-corruption, low cost of production, strategic location and respect for IPRs, India has been ranked at the top position.

On the technology and innovation front, the Prime Minister invited the global business community to invest in India and stated that their technology and India’s talent can together change the world; their scale combined with India’s skill-set can accelerate global economic growth.

Prime Minister’s Keynote was followed by an interactive session with the founder of Bloomberg Mr. Michael Bloomberg.

                Friends!

It is a pleasure for me to be among you in New York, the Nerve Centre of Global Business and Economy. I am extremely grateful to the Bloomberg Global Business Forum for giving me the opportunity to speak on India's feelings and prospects, India's expectations and aspirations, India's growth story and its future direction.

Friends,

Today, you are again looking at the same government in India which went to the public with its work of five years and came back with even more numbers. In your conversations you often talk about business statement. In this election, 130 crore Indians have not only expressed their sentiment but they also gave a judgment that development is their biggest priority. And the business leaders sitting here can understand that this strong mandate in favor of development is actually proclamation new opportunities in India. Today, the people of India are standing with that government, which does not hesitate in taking the biggest and most stringent decisions to improve the business environment. Today, there is a government in India which respects the business world and wealth creation.

Friends,

It will be in your knowledge that just a few days back, we have decided to drastically reduce the corporate tax. This is a very revolutionary step from the level of investment and after this decision, all the people from the business world whom I met or had a discussion with, are considering it very historical. During this time, several decisions have been announced one after another by the government to increase investment. We have also abolished more than 50 such old laws which were hindering the development work. Let me remind you again, it has not been more than three-four months of our new government. Today I want to say from this platform that this is just the beginning. There is still a long time to go. This is a golden opportunity for the business world across the world to partner with India in this journey. Friends,

Today, India is in a unique position where our rapid growth enables us to cater to diverse demand. Our people are rapidly defeating poverty, moving up the economic ladder and diversifying their consumption. Thus, if you want to invest in a market where there is scale, come to India. Our middles class is a huge segment of people who are aspirational and has a global outlook. Thus, if you want to invest in a market where the latest trends and features are appreciated, come to India. Our youth are one of the largest users of the app economy. From food to transport and from movies to hyperlocal delivery, start-ups are acing everything. Thus if you want to invest in start-ups with a huge market, come to India. Our infrastructure creation is expanding at an unprecedented pace. From highways to metros, from railways to ports, from airports to logistics, each sector is seeing massive investment and tremendous potential. Thus, if you want to invest in one of the largest infrastructure ecosystem, come to India. We are rapidly modernizing our cities, and equipping them with latest technology and citizen friendly infrastructure. Thus if you want to invest in urbanization, come to India. We have opened our defense sector like never before. If you want to make in India, for India and for the world, come to India.

Friends,

Today, as much our government is investing on the development of infrastructure in India, has never been done earlier. In the coming years we are now going to spend 100 lakh crore rupees, i.e. about $1.3 trillion on modern infrastructure. Apart from this, lakhs of crores of rupees are also being spent on India's social infrastructure. The roadmap for qualitative and quantitative leap in India's Growth Story has hit the ground. Now India has set a big goal - to make the country a $ 5 trillion economy. Friends,

When we came into government in 2014, the country's economy was at around $ 2 trillion. In the last five years, we added about one trillion dollars to it. And now we are working hard to achieve the goal of $ 5 trillion.

Friends,

To achieve this huge target, we also have the Capability and the Courage and conditions are also with us. Today there are four important factors of India's growth story which are difficult to find in the world together. These 4 factors are Democracy, Demography, Demand and Decisiveness. If I talk about the first factor, then this kind of opportunity and political stability in India has come after many decades. When there is Democracy, Political Stability, Predictable Policy, and Independent Judiciary then confidence of Safety, Security and Growth of investment is automatically found there.

Friends,

This growth is bolstered by India's Demographic Dividend and the Young and Energetic Talent Pool of India. Today India is one of the countries with the largest Engineering Education base and the strongest R&D facilities in the world. Due to the encouragement that the youth of India are getting regarding innovation, India is ranked number 3 in terms of Unicorns after America and China.

Friends,

The third is the factor of Demand. As India's large population is becoming economically empowered, Purchasing power is increasing, so is the demand too. For example, the growth of Air Passenger Traffic has been in double digit for the past few years. Because of that today India has become the third largest Aviation Market in the world.

Friends,

Along with Democracy, Demography and Demand, what makes India special today is Decisiveness. Despite being a Diverse and Federal Democracy, in the last 5 years the emphasis has been laid on preparing Seamless, Inclusive and Transparent arrangements for the whole of India.

.Where previously there was a web of taxes in India, now a single Indirect Tax Regime in the form of GST has become part of the business culture of the entire country.

· We have also worked hard to strengthen the IPR and trade mark regime.

.Similarly, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was created to deal with the insolvency and bankruptcy.

· We will continue to make necessary reforms to bring Laws related to Tax and Tax on Equity Investments at par with Global Tax Regime.

Apart from Tax Reforms, the world's largest Financial Inclusion has happened in India in a very short time. About 370 million people have been linked to banking system for the first time in the last 4-5 years. Today, almost every citizen of India has a unique ID, mobile phone and a bank account. Due to which Targeted Service Delivery increased, Leakages have stopped and Transparency has increased manifold.

Friends,

In the New India, we have started the campaign for de-regulation, de-licensing and de-bottlenecking. Due to such reforms, India has been consistently doing better in every Global Ranking. A jump of 10 points in the Logistics Performance Index, a jump of 13 points in the Global Competitiveness Index, a 24-point improvement in the Global Innovation Index and, most importantly, a 65-rank improvement in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, are phenomenal. And friends, you all know very well that these rankings do not improve just like that. We have improved the arrangements/systems and made the rules easier by going to the absolute ground level. Let me give you an example. Earlier it used to take many years for industries to get electricity connection. Now an electricity connection is provided in just few days. Similarly, it used to take several weeks to register a company earlier. Now company registration is done within a few hours. Let me give you an example of what has changed in the last 5 years. In the last 5 years there has been FDI of $286 billion in India. This is half of India's total FDI Inflow of last 20 years. 50 percent of the FDI that US has done in India in the last decades has been done only in the last 4 years. And this is when FDI Inflow Level is decreasing all over the world. There is another interesting thing in this, about 90 Percent FDI is done by Automatic Route and 40 Percent is Greenfield Investment. That means Investor's trust in India has increased today and they are coming for a long time.

Friends,

Bloomberg's own report is also a witness to the changes happening in India. India has been ranked number 1 in Asia in terms of investment in Bloomberg's Nation Brand Tracker - 2018 survey. India has been number one in 7 Indicators out of 10 - Political stability, Currency stability, High quality products, Anti-corruption, Low cost of production, Strategic location and respect for IPR. India is ranked high on rest of the indicators too.

Friends,

Your desires and our dreams match perfectly; your technology and our talent can change the world; your scale and our skills can speed up global economic growth;
Your prudent method and our pragmatic mind can write new stories in management;
Your rational ways and our human values can show the path which the world is looking for.
And if there is any gap anywhere;
I will personally act as a bridge.

Thank You!

Excellencies, Friend’s,

Today we all have gathered here to discuss the relevance of Mahatma Gandhi in the current era on his 150th birth anniversary.

I welcome all the distinguished guests here.

I express my special thanks to the UN for issuing a commemorative stamp on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Gandhi Ji was an Indian but he was not only for India. Today this platform is a living example of the same.

This is not seen anywhere in history when a person which does not have even far-fetched relationship with the administration and with the power of truth and non-violence, he not only shook the centuries-old empire but also instilled the spirit of freedom in many patriots.

Mahatma Gandhi was such a person and despite being so far away from power, he is still ruling the hearts of crores of people.

You can imagine how impressed people have been with his life even though he never met them. Whether it was Martin Luther King Jr. or Nelson Mandela, the basis of their ideas was Mahatma Gandhi, it was Gandhi's vision.

Friends,

Today the definition of democracy has a limited meaning that the people should choose the government of their choice and the government should work according to the expectations of the people. But Mahatma Gandhi emphasized on the real power of democracy. He showed the direction in which people should not depend on governance and become self-reliant.

Friends,

Mahatma Gandhi was the focal point of India's freedom struggle, but for a moment we should also think that if Gandhiji had been born in a free country, what would he have done?

He fought the freedom struggle, this is important but it is not the total expansion of Gandhiji’s work.

Mahatma Gandhi pioneered a social system that did not depend on the government.

Mahatma Gandhi brought change, it is well known, but it is also fair to say that he awakened the inner strength of the people and awakened them to bring about change.

Had Gandhi not been responsible for the freedom struggle, he still would have gone ahead with the basic elements of Swaraj and self-reliance.

This vision of Gandhiji is becoming a great medium of solving big challenges that India is facing today.

In the last 5 years, we have given priority to Peoples Participation. Whether it is Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Digital India, the people are now leading these campaigns themselves.

Friends,

Mahatma Gandhi used to say that his life is his message. Gandhiji never tried to make an impact from his life, but his life became the cause of inspiration. Today we are living in the era of How to Impress but Gandhiji's vision was - How to Inspire.

I want to tell you an incident related to what was the strength of Gandhiji's loyalty towards democracy. When I met Queen Elizabeth of Britain a few years ago, she showed me a napkin with great emotion. This was a handkerchief made from Khadi, which Gandhi had gifted her at the time of her marriage.

Just imagine, with whom he had a conflict of principles, still he had so much sensitivity in his relationship with her. He also wanted, the wellbeing and respect for those who were against him, with whom he was fighting the freedom struggle.

Friends,

It was this commitment to the principles that drew Gandhi's attention to seven such perversions that everyone should be aware of. These are

Wealth Without Work
Pleasure Without Conscience
Knowledge Without Character
Business Without Ethics
Science Without Humanity
Religion Without Sacrifice
Politics Without Principle

Whether it is climate change or terrorism, corruption or selfish social life, these principles of Gandhi ji act as a guide to protect humanity.

I believe that this path shown by Gandhiji will prove to be a motivator in creating a better world.

I understand that as long as this flow of ideas of Gandhiji with humanity continues, Gandhiji's inspiration and relevance will also remain among us.

Once again I express my gratitude to all of you!

 

Thank you.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi received the ‘Global Goalkeeper’ Award by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, on 24 September 2019. The award ceremony took place on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session in New York.

Prime Minister dedicated the award to those Indians who transformed the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan into a mass movement and made it a part of their daily lives.

“The success of the Swachh Bharat Mission is due to the people of India. They made this their own movement and ensured the desired results were attained.”, Prime Minister said after receiving the award.

Terming it as a significant moment personally to receive the award on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Prime Minister said Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is proof that when 130 crore Indians take a pledge, any challenge can be overcome. He added that India is making remarkable progress in fulfilling Mahatma Gandhi’s dream of a Swachh Bharat.

""In the last five years, a record of more than 11 crore toilets were constructed. This mission has benefitted the poor and women of the country the most”, Prime Minister noted. In addition to improving sanitation and health, building of 11 crore toilets has also boosted economic activity in villages, PM added.

Speaking about improving global sanitation coverage, Prime Minister said that India is ready to share its expertise and experiences with other nations, so that there can be collective effort towards increasing sanitation coverage.

Prime Minister also mentioned about India’s efforts towards preventive healthcare through mission mode movements like Fit India Movement and Jal Jeevan Mission.

                Mrs and Mr Gates,  
Excellencies,  
Friend, 

I am extremely grateful to you all for this honour. This honour is not mine but for those crores of Indians who have not only proved the resolve of Swachh Bharat but have also applied it in their everyday lives.  Receiving the award from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is special to me for two other reasons.  Firstly, the Foundation is working in remote areas of India as an important partner in the Swachh Bharat Mission.  Secondly, the way Bill and Milinda Gates are now contributing to social life after achieving several successes in personal life, I see it with great appreciation. 

Friends, 

It is also very important for me personally to get this award on the 150 birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.  This is a proof that if 130 crore people resolve to accomplish any resolution, then one can overcome any challenge.  I remember the kind of reaction that I received when I mentioned about Swachh Bharat five years ago.  Even today people often taunt me.  But when any work is done with a goal, with a purpose, and a commitment to one's work, then such things do not matter.  What matters to me is the coming together of 130 crore Indians to make our country clean.  What matters to me is to develop a vision among 130 crore Indians for cleanliness.  Every effort made by those 130 crore Indians to make India clean matters to me.  And so, I dedicate this honour to the Indians, who transformed the Swachh Bharat Mission into a mass movement; who began to make cleanliness a top priority in their daily lives.  Today I want to mention about the old lady who sold her goats to build toilets in the village.  Today I want to mention about those retired teachers who donated their full pension for the construction of toilets.  Today I want to mention about a woman who even sold her Mangalsutra to build a toilet in the house. 

Brothers and sisters,

Of late, such a campaign was not heard of and seen in any country.  This campaign was started by our government, but the command was taken by the people themselves.  As a result, in the last five years, over 11 crore toilets could be constructed in the country, which is a record.  As a result, the percentage of ​​rural sanitation which was once less than 40 percent before 2014, is now almost reaching 100 per cent.  Just imagine, less than 40 per cent in 70 years after independence and about 100 per cent in 5 years.  But I believe that the success of Swachh Bharat Mission is beyond any figure.  If this mission has provided the greatest benefit to any section of the society, then it is the poor of the country and the women of the country.  For those who are a little well-off, it is normal to build two to three toilets in their homes.  But those deprived of this facility knew the pain of not having a toilet very well.  For women, daughters and sisters in particular, not having toilets was one of the greatest difficulties in their lives.  It was against their dignity.  From my personal experience I can say that despite being aware of the whole situation, there was no concern about the importance of constructing toilets in the house.  Can you imagine that the women used to wait for the evening the entire day! Besides being prone to the diseases caused as a result of open defecation, this wait (for relieving themselves) pushed them further towards more diseases.

Due to lack of toilets, many girls had to drop out from schooling midway.  Our daughters want to study, but the lack of toilets had forced them to drop out from school and sit at home.  It was the responsibility of my government to pull away the poor women and daughters of the country from this situation, and we have done it with all our strength and honesty.  Today, it is a matter of great satisfaction for me that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a medium for the survival of millions.  As per the report of the World Health Organization, there is a possibility of saving 3 lakh lives due to clean India.  Similarly, UNICEF has estimated that every family living in the village who are constructing toilets in their homes is saving at least 50 thousand rupees.  I have been told that as per a new report by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the increase in Rural Sanitation in India has reduced the heart problem in children and also improved the Body Mass Index of women.  Looking at all these advantages of cleanliness, Mahatma Gandhi had said that he considered cleanliness more important than independence.  Today I am glad that Mahatma Gandhi's dream of cleanliness is now going to come true.  Gandhiji used to say that an ideal village can be built only when it is completely clean.  Today we are moving towards making the whole country ideal in terms of cleanliness, and not just the villages. 

Brothers and sisters,

Since the inception of the United Nations, its main objective has been to improve people's lives.  The Swachh Bharat Mission has not only made the lives of crores of people better, but has also protected their dignity and has also played an important role in achieving the goals of the United Nations. 

I would like to remind you of another study of UNICEF.  This report has revealed that the quality of ground water has improved in the last five years and I believe that Swachh Bharat Mission is also a major contributor to the same.  The Swachh Bharat Mission has another impact that has not been very well discussed.  More than 11 crore toilets built during this campaign has also opened a new door to economic activity at the village level.  The raw material mobilized for the construction of toilets, and the women being given the major work of construction as heads has given new employment opportunities to the poor at the very grassroots level. 

Friends,

The simple meaning of democracy is that people should remain at the center of the systems and schemes.  A strong democracy is the one that makes policies keeping the needs of the people at the center.  And when the expectations and needs of the people, as well as the policies and decisions of the government are on a single platform, then the people make the schemes successful.  This power of democracy is also reflected in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.  The success of Swachh Bharat Mission is also an example of bringing alive a system of the Constitution.

Friends,

India had seen only Constitutional Federalism for decades.  Our government has tried to convert this into Cooperative Federalism and over a period we are now moving towards the path of Competitive-Cooperative Federalism.  The way in which different states of India went ahead and participated in this campaign, made people aware, worked for the construction of toilets, is also commendable.  During this campaign, the central government has made the states partners in every subject related to cleanliness.  No stone was left unturned from training to funding.  The states were helped in every way so that they could speed up the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in their own way and fulfil the resolutions related to it.  Today, I am glad that through the Swachhta Survekshan, there is a competition among the states to reach the top in the cleanliness rankings. 

Friends & Excellencies, 

I am also pleased with this contribution of India to the world because we have considered the world as our family.  For thousands of years, we have been taught that the  उदार चरितानाम तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्।    That is, for the down to earth person or for the golden-hearted person, the whole earth is a family.  Therefore, India wants to play a strong role in the International Cooperation for Sanitation and Hygiene.  We are ready to share our experience and expertise with other countries of the world.  India is close to achieving its goal of cleanliness, at the same time India is also working at a rapid pace on other major missions.  A campaign to promote Fitness and Preventive Healthcare is underway through Fit India Movement.  By 2025, we have set the target for India to be free from TB and we are also moving rapidly towards Universal Immunization.  With the National Nutrition Mission, India is also overcoming problems like anemia and stunting very fast.  Our focus under the Jal Jivan Mission is on water conservation and recycling so that every Indian gets adequate and clean water. 

And India has also launched a campaign to get rid of single-use plastic by 2022.  Today, while I am talking to you, the work of collecting plastic waste is going on in many parts of India.  Many such mass movements are going on in India today.  I have full faith in the strength of 1.3 billion Indians.  I am confident that like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, other missions will also be successful.  With this expectation, I conclude my speech thanking all the friends of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation once again for this award, and also other friends present here today. 

 Thanks a lot!!!

                To commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi – a global icon of peace and non-violence, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted a high-level event on the sidelines of the 74th UNGA today at 6:30 pm in the ECOSOC Chamber of the UN Headquarters.



The event was graced by H.E. Mr. António Guterres, Secretary General of the UN, H.E. Mr. Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, H.E. Mr. Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore, H.E. Ms. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, H.E. Mr. Andrew Holness, Prime Minister of Jamaica and H.E. Ms. Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand.

Other dignitaries who took part in the event include the Prime Minister of Bhutan H.E. Mr. Lotay Tshering, First Lady of Republic of Korea H.E. Ms. Kim Jung-Sook, senior officials of the UN and diplomats from member states.



External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar gave the welcome remarks. The participating dignitaries together inaugurated the Gandhi Solar Park at the UN Headquarters (contributed by Government of India to the UN), the Gandhi Peace Garden at State University of New York College at Old Westbury and unveiled the special commemorative edition of the Gandhi@150 Postage Stamps brought out by the UN Postal Administration.

PM Modi in his keynote address talked about the contributions of Mahatma Gandhi to the cause of greater human freedom in the 20th century; emphasis on the welfare of all (Sarvodaya); championing of the downtrodden (Antyodaya); and prescient concern for environmental sustainability. PM said that Mahatma Gandhi’s faith in collective will, shared destiny, moral purpose, people’s movements and personal responsibility are extremely germane to contemporary times.



PM said that violent conflict, terrorism, economic inequalities, socio-economic deprivation, pandemics and the looming existential threat of climate change are impacting people, states and societies. Leadership is crucial to addressing any and every one of these issues and the values promoted by Gandhi serve as moral compass for enlightened leadership.

Secretary General Guterres said that Gandhi gave us a talisman to judge any policy and indeed any action – to assess if the proposed action would enhance the life, dignity and destiny of the poorest person we met. Sanitation, maternal health, primary education, gender balance, women empowerment, reduction of hunger, and ensuring partnerships for development formed the basis for Gandhi's life and practice long before the MDGs or SDGs were designed. In fact, the Sustainable Development Goals are Gandhian philosophy in action.

The participating leaders used the occasion to pay tribute to Gandhian thinking and said that the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi will endure for generations to come. They said the name of Mahatma Gandhi transcends the bounds of race, religion and nation-states, and has emerged as the prophetic voice of the twenty-first century. Gandhi was a multi-faceted personality. He was a nationalist and an internationalist, a traditionalist and reformist, a political leader and a spiritual mentor, a writer and a thinker and a pacifist and an activist for social reform and change. The world remembers the Mahatma not just for his passionate adherence to the practice of non-violence and supreme humanism, but as a benchmark against which we test men and women in public life, political ideas and government policies, and the hopes and wishes of our shared planet.

The first and second editions of the FIPIC took place in Fiji (2015) and Jaipur (2016). During the FIPIC Summits Prime Minister articulated India’s desire to be a close partner of the Pacific Island nations and its readiness to work closely to advance their developmental agenda. This is the first time, the Prime Minister has met the leaders of the PSIDS on the margins of UNGA in plurilateral format.

He highlighted the need for development policies to be inclusive and sustainable to reduce inequality and contribute to empowerment and improvement of the quality of people’s lives. He said that India is equally committed to tackle the impact of climate change and supports the efforts of the PSIDs to achieve their developmental goals through necessary developmental and technical assistance.

PM Modi underlined the reality of climate change and called for increasing the share of renewable energy in the total energy mix to mitigate many adverse effects of climate change. He also expressed India’s readiness to share its experiences in developing alternative energy. He expressed his satisfaction as many countries from the region have joined the International Solar Alliance and invited others to join this initiative. PM also invited Leaders of PSIDS to join the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).



In the spirit of his fundamental Mantra ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas (together with all, for the development of all and with the trust of all) PM Modi announced allocation of US$ 12 million grant (US$ 1 million to each PSIDS) towards implementation of high impact developmental project in the area of their choice. In addition, a concessional Line of Credit of US$150 Million which can be availed by the PSIDS for undertaking solar, renewable energy and climate related projects based on each country’s requirement was announced.

PM Modi reaffirming his commitment for providing developmental assistance for capacity building proposed to depute technical experts to provide training and offered to organize specialized courses also under ITEC programme in priority areas identified by partner countries, including training of diplomats from Pacific Island nations at the Foreign Service Institute. In the health sector, PM offered to organize a Jaipur Foot Artificial Limb Fitment Camp in a Pacific regional hub under ‘India for Humanity’ programme.

To further enhance people-to-people contact, PM announced a Distinguished Visitors Programme under which eminent persons from these countries can visit India. India would also welcome the visit of a Parliamentary delegation from the PICs to India. To continue High-Level engagement, PM extended an invitation to all the leaders for the 3rd FIPIC Summit to be held in Port Moresby in first half of 2020.

Leaders of PSIDS welcomed the initiatives proposed by PM Modi to strengthen engagement and cooperation between the two sides and reassured full support from their respective governments.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the Climate Action Summit's opening ceremony organized by the UN Secretary General on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the PM said that this was the first opportunity to address the United Nations, after having received the Champion of the Earth award last year. He said that  to overcome a serious challenge like climate change, what we are doing at the moment is just not enough. He called for a global people’s movement to bring about behavioral change.

 

He said that the respect for nature, the judicious use of resources, reducing our needs and living within our means have all been important aspects of both our traditions and present day efforts. He added that Need not Greed has been our guiding principle. And therefore India today has come not just to talk about the seriousness of this issue, but to present a practical approach and a roadmap. We believe that an ounce of practice is worth more than a ton of preaching.

 

He pledged that the share of non fossil fuel will be increased, and by 2022 India’s renewable energy capacity would be increased to much beyond 175 GW, and later till 450 GW. He said that India plans to make the transport sector green through e mobility and considerably increase the proportion of the biofuel blend in petrol and diesel. He added that clean cooking gas has been provided to 150 million families in India.

 

Shri Modi said that Jal Jeevan mission has been launched for water conservation, rainwater harvesting and for the development of water resources and approximately 50 billion dollars is going to be spent on this in the next few years.

 

He said that on the International forum, almost 80 countries have joined our International Solar Alliance campaign. India and Sweden together with other partners are launching the Leadership group within the Industry transition track. This initiative will provide a platform for governments and the private sector with opportunities for cooperation in the area of Technology innovation. This will help to develop low carbon pathways for industry.

 

He said that in order to make our infrastructure disaster resilient, India is launching a Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and invited other Member states to join this coalition. He added that this year on the occasion of India’s Independence Day on 15th August, a people's movement to end the use of single use plastic was called for. He emphasized that the time for talking is over; the world needs to act now.

                Namaste!

Mr. President,

World welfare begins with the public welfare and health is a very important unit of this. And hence this subject is a very big priority for India.

We are working on this with Holistic Approach through four pillars. The first pillar is Preventive Health. We have laid special emphasis on Yoga, Ayurveda and fitness. We are building more than 1.25 lakh wellness centers.

This is helping to control lifestyle diseases like diabetes, blood pressure, depression etc.

The ever increasing craze of e-cigarette is a matter of great concern. India has banned e-cigarette to save the younger generation from this serious threat.

Our Clean Indian Mission has contributed to saving millions of lives.

We also have special emphasis on immunization. With the addition of new vaccines, we have also improved access to far-flung areas.

The second pillar is Affordable Healthcare. We have implemented the world's largest health assurance scheme Ayushman Bharat. Under this, 500 million poor are being provided free treatment up to 500 thousand rupees per year. And in the last one year only 4.5 million people have been benefited from it.

We have started more than five thousand special pharmacy stores where more than 800 essential medicines are being made available at affordable prices.

The cost of heart stent has been reduced by 80 percent and the cost of knee-implant by 50 to 70 percent.

Millions of people suffering from kidney problems are availing free dialysis facility in India.

The third pillar is to improve the Supply Side and for this we have taken many historic steps for quality medical education in India, and for medical infrastructure. We have made radical reforms for the second sector.

And the fourth pillar is Mission Mode Intervention. If mothers and children are healthy, then it can create the foundation to make the whole society healthy and hence we have taken initiatives like National Nutrition Campaign on mission mode.

Sustainable Development Goals aims to eliminate TB by 2030. In India, we intend to achieve this in mission mode by 2025 and I am confident that we will achieve this goal as well.

We have also started a campaign against the diseases caused due to air pollution and the ones that are transferred from animals to humans.

Excellencies,

Health is not just about getting rid of disease, healthy life is also the right of everyone. It is our government's responsibility to make every effort for the same.

And India's efforts are not confined to the boundaries of India only. We have collaborated and will continue to increase access to affordable healthcare through tele-medicine in many countries, especially to the countries in Africa.

Our experience and our capabilities are available to all the developing countries.

Excellencies,

I would end my talk with the feelings of Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah, Sarve Santu Niramaya Which means, Wishing all happiness and wishing all a disease free life.

Thanks a lot!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi spoke at the first-ever United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting on universal health coverage, on 23 September 2019.


Prime Minister in his remarks highlighted the bold steps taken by India to achieve Universal Health Coverage. He said that health does not simply mean freedom from diseases. A healthy life is every person’s right. The onus for this is on governments to ensure this.


He said that India has taken a holistic approach towards this subject and is working on four main pillars of healthcare:


- Preventive Healthcare


- Affordable Healthcare


- Improvements on the supply side


- Implementation in mission mode



Prime Minister said that special emphasis on Yoga, Ayurveda and Fitness and building more than 125,000 wellness centers have helped to promote preventive healthcare, helping in controlling life style diseases such as diabetes, blood pressure, depression etc. Banning of e-cigarettes, greater awareness through Clean India campaign and immunization campaigns have also contributed to health promotion.

“To ensure affordable healthcare, India has rolled out the world’s largest health insurance scheme- Ayushman Bharat. Under this scheme, 500 million poor have been given the facility of free treatment worth up to 500,000 rupees annually (more than USD$7000). There are more than 5000 Special Pharmacies, where more than 800 varieties of vital medicines are available at affordable prices.”, PM said

He also mentioned several historic steps taken by India to ensure quality medical education and medical infrastructure development.

On mission mode interventions in health sector, Prime Minister spoke about the role of National Nutrition Mission in improving nutritional status of mother and child. He highlighted India’s commitment to eliminate Tuberculosis by 2025, five years ahead of the global goal of 2030. He also mentioned about the campaign against diseases that spread due to air pollution and through animals, are of vital importance.

India’s efforts are not limited to its boundaries. India has helped to provide access to affordable health care including by way of tele-medicine to several other countries, especially African countries.

The meeting was held under the theme ""Universal Health Coverage: Moving Together to Build a Healthier World,” which aims to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage (UHC).It aims at mobilizing the global community to secure political commitment from Heads of State and Government to accelerate progress toward achieving universal health coverage by 2030.
Nearly 160 UN Member States are slated to speak at this meeting.

In 2015 Heads of States and Governments made a commitment to achieve universal health coverage by 2030, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

                I thank UN Secretary General for organizing the Global climate summit.

After having received the Champion of the Earth award last year, this is my first opportunity to address the United Nations. I am pleased that my first meeting during my visit to New York is on the subject of Climate.

Excellencies,

Various efforts are being made by different countries to fight climate change.

We must accept that if we have to overcome a serious challenge like climate change, then what we are doing at the moment is just not enough.

What is needed today, is a comprehensive approach which covers everything from education to values, and from lifestyle to developmental philosophy. What we need is a global people’s movement to bring about behavioral change.

The respect for nature, the judicious use of resources, reducing our needs and living within our means have all been important aspects of both our traditions and present day efforts. Need not Greed has been our guiding principle.

And therefore India today has come not just to talk about the seriousness of this issue, but to present a practical approach and a roadmap. We believe that an ounce of practice is worth more than a ton of preaching.

In India, we are going to increase the share of non fossil fuel, and by 2022 we plan to increase our renewable energy capacity to much beyond 175 GW, and later till 450 GW.

In India we have made plans to make our transport sector green through e mobility.

India is also working to considerably increase the proportion of the biofuel blend in petrol and diesel.

We have provided clean cooking gas to 150 million families.

We have launched the Jal Jeevan mission for water conservation, rainwater harvesting and for the development of water resources. India is going to spend approximately 50 billion dollars on this in the next few years.

On the International forum, almost 80 countries have joined our International Solar Alliance campaign. India and Sweden together with other partners are launching the Leadership group within the Industry transition track. This initiative will provide a platform for governments and the private sector with opportunities for cooperation in the area of Technology innovation. This will help to develop low carbon pathways for industry.

In order to make our infrastructure disaster resilient, India is launching a Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. I invite Member states to join this coalition.

This year on the occasion of India’s Independence day on 15th August, we called for a peoples movement to end the use of single use plastic. I hope that this will create an awareness at a global level about the harmful effects of single use plastic.

Excellencies,

I am happy to announce that tomorrow we are going to inaugurate solar panels on the roof of the UN building, funded by India at a cost of 1 million dollars.

The time for talking is over; the world needs to act now.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

                Good morning Houston,
Good morning Texas,
Good morning America,
Greetings to my fellow Indians in India and around the world.

Friends,

This morning we have a very special person with us. He needs no introduction. His name is familiar to every person on the planet.

His names comes up in almost every conversation in the world on global politics. His every word is followed by tens of millions.

He was a household name and very popular even before he won on to occupy the highest office in this great country.

From CEO to Commander-in-Chief, from boardroom to the Oval Office, from studios to global stage, from politics to the economy and to security he has left a deep and lasting impact everywhere.

Today he is here with us. It is my honor and privilege to welcome here in this magnificent stadium and magnificent gathering.

And I can say I had a chance to meet him often and every time I found the friendliness, warmth, energy, the President of the United States of America – Mr. Donald Trump.

This is extraordinary, this is unprecedented.

Friends,

As I told you we have met a few times and every time he has been the same warm, friendly, accessible, energetic and full of wit. I admire him for something more.

His sense of leadership, a passion for America, a concern for every American, a belief in American future and a strong resolve to Make America Great Again.

And he has already made the American economy strong again. He has achieved much for the United States and for the world.

Friends,

We in India have connected well with President Trump. The words of candidate Trump – Abki Baar Trump Sarkar rang loud and clear and his celebration in the White House lit up millions of faces with joy and appreciation.

When I met him for the first time he said to me, ‘India has true friend in White House.’ Your presence here today is great testimony to that.

In these years our two nations have taken the relationships to new heights. Mr. President this morning in Houston, you can hear the heartbeat of this great partnership in this celebration of the world’s two largest democracies.

You can feel the strength and depth of human bonds between our two great nations. People are at the heart of all relationships from Houston to Hyderabad, from Boston to Bengaluru, from Chicago to Shimla, from Los Angeles to Ludhiana, from New Jersey to New Delhi.

Hundreds of millions are glued to their TV even though it is rather late on a Sunday night in India millions around the world, in different time zones are with us today. They are witnessing history in the making.

Mr. President, you had introduced me to your family in 2017 and today I have the honor to introduce you to my family, over a billion Indians and people of Indian heritage around the globe.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you my friend, a friend of India, a great American President Mr. Donald Trump.

                Howdy my friends,

This scene, this atmosphere is just unimaginable. And when it comes to Texas then everything has to be big and grand, this is ingrained in the nature of Texas.

Today the spirit of Texas is also being reflected here. The presence of this humongous crowd is not just limited to arithmetic, today we are witnessing a history in the making here and even chemistry too.

This energy here in the NRG is a witness to the growing synergy between India and America.

Whether it is the presence of President Trump here or the presence of many elected representatives of the great democracy of America be they Republicans or Democrats, their presence here and praising India, lauding me, congratulating me, what Steny Hoyer, Senator Cornyn, Senator Cruz and other friends have said about progress of India and praised us, it is honoring the capabilities of Indians in America and their achievements.

This is reverence for 1.3 billion Indians. Other than the elected representatives there are many other American friends who are present in this program today. On behalf of every Indian I would like to extend a hearty welcome to them also.

I also congratulate the organizers of this event. I have been told that a large number of people had registered for this but due to lack of space, thousands of people could not come here. I personally apologize to those who could not come here.

I would also express my deep appreciation to the Houston and Texas administration, who handled the situation and streamlined the arrangements in such a short time after a sudden change of weather two days ago, and as President Trump was saying, they proved that Houston is strong.

Friends,

The name of this program is Howdy Modi, but Modi alone is nothing. I am an ordinary person working as per the wishes of 130 crore Indians. And so when you have asked Howdy Modi, then my heart says the answer to that really is- All is well in India.  Sob khoob bhalo (Bengali) , Antaa baagundi (Telugu), Ellaam sowkkiyam (Tamil),   Ellam Saukhyam ( Malayalam), Sab Changaa see (Punjabi), Badha Ja Majama Chhe (Gujarati)  

Friends,

Our American friends must be wondering what I have said. President Trump and my American friends, I have said only this much - Everything is fine but in some different languages ​​of India.

Our languages are a great identity of our Liberal and Democratic Society. For centuries hundreds of languages, hundreds of dialects, have been moving forward in our country with a sense of co-existence and they still remain the mother tongue of millions of people.

And not only language, our country has different sects, dozens of denominations, different methods of worship, hundreds of different regional cuisines, different clothing patterns, different seasons, which made this land amazing.

Unity in diversity is our heritage, this is our specialty. This diversity of India is the very basis of our Vibrant Democracy. This is our source of power and inspiration. Wherever we go, we carry the rites of diversity and democracy along with us.

Today, more than 50 thousand Indians sitting here in the stadium are present here today as the representatives of our great tradition.

Many among you present here have also made active contribution in the general elections of 2019, the biggest celebration of democracy in India. It was indeed an election that brought out the power of Indian Democracy to the world.

More than 610 million voters took part in this election. In a way, almost double the total population of America. There were also 80 million youth who were the first time voters.

This time highest number of women voters had voted in the history of democracy of India and this time the highest number of women have also been elected.

Friends,

The 2019 general elections made another new record. It happened after six decades that a government returned with even greater numbers than earlier after completing their previous five year term.

Why did all this happen, what caused it? No, it is not because of Modi, it happened because of the Indians.

Friends,

Indians are identified by their virtue of patience but now we are impatient for the development of the country and to take the country to newer heights in the 21st century. Today India's most popular word is development, today India's biggest mantra is - Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas. Today, India's biggest policy is public participation. Today, the most popular slogan of India is accomplishment by way of resolve and today India's biggest resolve is - New India.

Today India is working day-night to fulfill the dream of New India and the most important thing in it is that we are not competing with anyone but ourselves.

We are challenging ourselves. We are changing ourselves.

Friends,

Today, India wants to move ahead faster than ever. Today, India is challenging the thinking of some people, whose thinking was that nothing can change.

In the last five years, 130 crore Indians have together achieved such results in every field, which no one could have imagined earlier.

We are aiming high, we are achieving higher.

Brothers & sisters,

In seven decades the rural sanitation of the country had reached only 38 percent. In five years, we built more than 110 million toilets. Today rural sanitation is at 99 percent.

Cooking gas connections in the country were also close to 55 percent only. Within five years, it reached 95 percent. In just five years, we have connected more than 150 million people with gas connections.

Earlier rural road connectivity in India was also at only 55 percent. In five years, we took it to 97 percent. In just five years, we have built over 2 lakh kilometers of roads in rural areas of the country, i.e. 200 thousand kms.

Less than 50 percent people in India had bank accounts. Today, in five years, about 100% of the families have joined the banking system. In five years, we have opened new bank accounts of more than 370 million people.

Friends,

Today, when people are not worried about basic necessities, they are able to dream big and are putting all their energies in the direction of achieving them.

Friends,

Ease of doing business is important for us as much as the ease of living and its path is empowerment. When the common man of the country is empowered then the social and economic development of the country will move forward at a very fast pace.

Let me give you an example today. Nowadays it is said that - Data is the new oil. You Houstonites know very well what it means when it comes to oil.

I will also add to this that Data is the new gold. The entire focus of Industry 4.0 is on data. If in the whole world, listen carefully, if the lowest price data is available anywhere in the whole world, then that country is India.

Today in India, the cost of 1GB of data is only around 25-30 cent i.e. just a quarter of a dollar and here I would also like to mention that the average world price of 1GB of data is 25-30 times more than that.

This cheap data is becoming a new identity of Digital India in India. Cheap data has also redefined governance in India. Today, about 10 thousand services of Central Government and State Governments are available online in India.

Friends,

There was a time when getting a passport took two to three months in India. Now the passport comes home in less than a week. You probably know more than me about the kind of problems that were there with the visa earlier. Today US is one of the biggest users of India's e-visa facility.

Friends,

There was a time when the registration of a new company took two to three weeks. Now a new company can be registered within 24 hours. There was a time when filing a tax return was a big headache. It used to take months to get tax refund.

Now you will be shocked if you hear about the changes that have taken place. This time, on August 31, in one day, I am talking about one day only, about 50 lakh people i.e. 5 million people have filed their income tax returns online in one single day.

That means 5 million returns in just one day, i.e. more than double the total population of Houston. And another biggest issue which was there earlier that tax refund used to take months, now it is directly transferred to the bank in 8 to 10 days.

Brothers and sisters,

Any country which is striving for rapid development, welfare schemes are necessary for its citizens. Along with running welfare schemes for the needy citizens, quite a few things are also being bid farewell to build a new India.

We have given as much importance to the welfare as we have given to the farewell. On this 2 October, when the country celebrates the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, India will give farewell to open defecation.

India has also given farewell to over 1500 very old and archaic laws in the last five years. The web of dozens of taxes in India also used to create a hindrance for fostering a business friendly environment.

Our government gave farewell to this web of taxes and implemented the GST. After so many years, we have realized the dream of one nation one tax in the country.

Friends,

We are also challenging corruption. We are taking one step after another to give it farewell from every level. In the last two-three years, India has also given farewell to more than three and a half lakh dubious companies.

We have also given farewell to more than 80 million fake names which existed only on documents and were taking advantage of government services. And friends, can you imagine how many rupees have been saved from falling into the wrong hands by removing these fake names, about $ 20 billion.

We are building a transparent ecosystem in the country so that the benefits of development reach every Indian. And brothers and sisters, if even a single Indian stays away from development, that too is not acceptable to India.

For 70 years our country had yet another big challenge to which India has now given farewell just a few days ago.

Yes, you got it. That is the issue of Article 370. Article 370 had deprived the people of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh from development and equal rights. Forces of terrorism and separatism were taking advantage of the situation.

The rights given by the Constitution of India to the rest of Indians are now available to the people of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh too.

Discrimination against women, children and dalits has now ended there.

Friends,

It was discussed for hours in both the Upper House and the Lower House of our Parliament, which was telecast live in the country and the whole world to see. In India, our party does not have a majority in the Upper House i.e. in the Rajya Sabha, yet both our parliament’s Upper House and Lower House have passed the decisions related to it by two-thirds majority.

I urge you all, I urge you all to give a standing ovation for all the MPs of India.

Thank you very much.

Whatever India is doing for itself that is also troubling some people who are not able to manage their own country. These people have made hatred towards India the center of their politics.

These are the people who want unrest, are supporters of terror, and nurture terror. Their identity is well known not only by you all but by the whole world.

Whether it is 9/11 in the United States or 26/11 in Mumbai, where can its conspirators be found.

Friends,

The time has come for a decisive fight against terrorism and against those who promote terrorism. I would like to emphasize here that in this fight President Trump has stood firmly against terror.

We should give standing ovation for President Trump's morale in the fight against terror.

Thank you. Thank you friends.

Brothers and sisters,

A lot is happening in India, a lot is changing and we are moving ahead with our intentions that we have to do a lot more.

We are determined to set new challenges, and to fulfill them. I wrote a poem a few days ago on these very feelings of the country. Today I will recite just two lines from that. As there is not much time, I will not say much.

The mount of difficulties which is lying there, that is also the tower of my spirits.

Friends,

India is not avoiding challenges today, we are taking them head on. Today India insists on complete solutions to the problems, not just on some incremental changes. Today, India is making all that possible which seemed impossible just a while ago.

Friends,

India is now gearing up for a $ 5 trillion economy. We are emphasizing on increasing infrastructure, investment and exports. We are moving forward by creating a people friendly, development friendly and investment friendly environment.

We are about to spend one hundred lakh crores i.e. about $1.3 trillion, on infrastructure.

Friends,

In spite of all the uncertainties in the world, India's growth rate has been an average 7.5% in the last five years. And also do keep in mind that if we look at the average of the entire tenure of any government, it has never happened before.

For the first time, there has been a period of low inflation, low fiscal deficit and high growth. Today India is one of the finest FDI destination in the world. FDI inflow has almost doubled from 2014 to 2019.

Recently, we have simplified the norms of FDI in single brand retail. Foreign investment in coal mining and contract manufacturing can now be made up to 100%.

I met the CEOs of the energy sector here in Houston yesterday. The decision taken by India for a drastic reduction in corporate tax made all the people very excited. Their feedback is that the decision to reduce corporate tax has led to a very positive message not only in India but also among the global business leaders.

This decision will make India more globally competitive.

Friends,

There is immense scope for Indians to move forward in India, and for Americans in America. The journey of new India for a $ 5 trillion economy and the strong economic growth of America under the leadership of President Trump will give new wings to these possibilities.

The economic miracles that President Trump mentioned in his address will be icing in the cake. I am going to have discussions with President Trump in the next two to three days. I hope that will yield some positive results too.

Although President Trump calls me a tough negotiator but he himself specializes in the art of the deal and I am learning a lot from him.

Friends,

Our forward march for a better future is going to grow at a much faster pace now. All of you my friends are an important part of this, the driving force behind it. You are far away from your country, but the government of your country is not far from you.

In the last five years, we have changed both the meaning of dialogue and the way of communication with the Indian diaspora. Now the Embassy and Consulate of India abroad are not just a government office but your first partners.

The government is also continuously working to protect the interests of our friends working abroad. MADAD, e-migrate, pre-departure training before going abroad, improvement of insurance scheme for overseas Indians, facility of OCI card to all the PIO cardholders, and many such things have been done which have helped overseas Indians both before and after going abroad.

Our government has also strengthened the Indian Community Welfare Fund. Overseas Indian Assistance Centers have also been opened in many new cities all over the world.

Brothers and sisters,

Today, the impression of the message emanating from this platform will give rise to new definitions, new possibilities in the 21st century. We both have the power of same democratic values.

Both countries have similar resolutions for new construction and both of them will definitely lead us towards a bright future.

Mr. President, I would like you to visit India with family and give us an opportunity to welcome you. Our friendship will give new heights to the shared dreams and vibrant future of India and America.

I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to President Trump and the political, social and business leaders of America for coming here.

I also thank the Government of Texas and the administration here.

Thank you Houston, thank you America.
May God bless you all.
Thank you.

                I am visiting the United States of America from 21 to 27 September 2019. I will visit Houston and, thereafter, New York to attend the High Level Segment of the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

In Houston, I will interact with CEOs of leading energy companies in the US with the aim to enhance India-US energy partnership. Energy has emerged as a new area of mutually beneficial cooperation and is fast becoming an important facet of our bilateral relationship.

In Houston, I look forward to my meeting with and address to the Indian-American community. Their success in diverse fields, their contribution to the US in various walks of life, their strong bonds with India and their role as a living bridge between our two democracies is a source of pride for us. It is a matter of great honour for the Indian diaspora and pleasure for me that President of the United States Mr. Donald Trump will grace the occasion with his presence and join me in addressing the community. This would be a maiden appearance of US President in an Indian community event with me, and marks a new milestone in our outreach to them.

While in Houston, I will also have the opportunity to interact with various groups of the Indian-American community and their elected representatives.

In New York, I will participate in various major events in the United Nations. Since its participation as a founding member of the United Nations in 1945, India has shown unwavering commitment to multilateralism to advance peace and security and promote broad-based inclusive economic growth and development in the world.

This year, the 74th session of the UN General Assembly has the theme “Galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion”. There are many pressing challenges for the international community – a still fragile global economy, turbulence and tension in many parts of the world, growth and spread of terrorism, climate change and the endemic global challenge of poverty. They require stronger global commitment and concerted multilateral action. I will reiterate our commitment to reformed multilateralism, which is responsive, effective and inclusive, and in which India plays her due role.

Through my participation in UN events, I will showcase our success in realizing the Sustainable Development Goals. At the Climate Action Summit on 23rd September, I will highlight India’s robust action to address climate change in line with global goals and our international commitments.

At the UN event on Universal Health Coverage, similarly, I look forward to sharing on the world stage India’s achievements in providing healthcare for the needy through many initiatives, including the Ayushman Bharat programme.

India will also host at the UN an event to celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, which will underline the continuing relevance of Gandhian thoughts and values in today’s world. Several Heads of State and Government along with UN Secretary General will grace the occasion to pay our collective tribute to Gandhiji and underscore the significance of his message.

I will also hold bilateral meetings with leaders from other countries and UN entities on the margins of the UNGA. For the first time, India will hold leadership level interactions with the leaders of the Pacific Island States, and leaders of the CARICOM group on the margins of UNGA. This will take forward our vibrant South-South cooperation and partnership with them.

I look forward to meeting President Trump in Houston and New York in a span of a few days. We will review our bilateral relations in order to bring even more benefits to our two nations and peoples. The US is a vital partner for our national development, with rich possibilities of partnership in education, skills, research, technology and innovation, and an enabler for India in economic growth and national security. Shared values, convergent interests and complementary strengths provide the foundation for natural partnership between the world's oldest and largest democracies. Working together, we can contribute to building a more peaceful, stable, secure, sustainable and prosperous world.

The New York leg of my visit will also cover important elements of our bilateral relations with the US. I look forward to addressing the opening plenary of the Bloomberg Global Business Forum and inviting American business leaders to participate more actively in India's economic growth and transformation. I am honoured by the decision of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to confer upon me the Global Goalkeepers Goals Award 2019.

I am confident that my visit would present India as a vibrant land of opportunities, a reliable partner and a global leader, and will also help impart new energy to our relations with the US.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi and H.E. Mr Khaltmaagiin Battulga, President of Mongolia, jointly unveiled a statue of Lord Buddha and his two disciples, installed at the historic Gandan Tegchenling Monastery in Ulaanbaatar.

 

Prime Minister had offered prayers at the Gandan Tegchenling Monastery during his visit to Mongolia in 2015 and had announced to gift a statue of Lord Buddha to the monastery, underlining the common Buddhist heritage and civilizational links between our two countries and peoples.

 

The Statue depicts Lord Buddha in a sitting posture along with his two disciples conveying the message of compassion along with peace and co-existence. The statue was installed and consecrated at the Gandan Monastery earlier this month during the third edition of SAMVAAD dialogue held in Ulaanbaatar from 6 – 7 September 2019. Third edition of SAMVAAD dialogue brought together Buddhist religious leaders, experts and scholars from different countries to deliberate on contemporary issues related to Buddhism.



Gandan Tegchenling Monastery is a prominent centre of Mongolian Buddhists and a treasure house of valuable Buddhist heritage. It hosted the 11th General Assembly of Asian Buddhist Conference for Peace (ABCP) from 21-23 June 2019 marking the 50th anniversary of the Conference. Over 150 guests from 14 countries including India, South Korea, Russia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, North Korea, LPDR, Thailand, Japan etc. had participated in the event.



The Statue unveiled today by Prime Minister and Mongolian President H.E.  Khaltmaagiin Battulga symbolizes the shared respect of our two countries for the universal message of Lord Buddha.

Governor of Gujarat Acharya Devvrat ji, Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Vijaybhai

Rupani, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Bhai; My great brothers and sisters present in large numbers and all the dignitaries present on the stage!

At one point of time I was into photography. I loved taking photos. Over time my photography stopped but today as I am sitting here, I feel the urge to take some snaps. I am missing my camera. The view I am seeing from above is such that there is a river of people (Jan sagar) below, a river of water (Jal sagar) behind and I will also request all the people with camera, who have already taken a lot of our pictures, to shift the angle to the other side and click the photo of how Jan sagar and Jal sagar are converging. Perhaps such a view is very rare in the world of photography. And I also congratulate the administrators here for their aesthetic sense in choosing this location.

It's a great privilege to have got the opportunity to visit Maa Narmada on this day, and to offer prayers and I am thankful to all of you, and the Government of Gujarat for inviting me to be a part of in Namami Devi Narmada ceremony. I also congratulate all the people of Gujarat for this festival and today I want to say that the scheme benefits the people, the farmers of four states Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat.

 

Friends, 

In our culture it has always been believed that development can happen even while protecting the environment. Nature is worshipped by us; nature is our jewel. A live example of how development can be brought about while preserving the environment is now seen in Kevadia.

Since this morning I have had the opportunity to visit many places. And at every place I have experienced the wonderful synergy of nature and development. On one side there is Sardar Sarovar dam and electricity generating equipment, while on the other side there are very beautiful arrangements related to eco-tourism like Ekta Nursery, Butterfly Garden, Cactus Garden etc. Amidst all this, the grand statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is seen blessing us. I think Kevadia is having a wonderful confluence of progress, nature, environment and tourism and it is a great inspiration for all.

 

Friends, 

Today is also the birth anniversary of Vishwakarma ji, the God of creation. In our resolution of moving towards creating a New India, creativity like Lord Vish wakarma and willpower to achieve big goals are also very important. We all pray to Lord Vish wakarma to keep his blessings on India.

Today, as I am talking to you, the world's tallest statue of Sardar Saheb and the Sardar Sarovar Dam both are the symbols of willpower.

I believe that with his inspiration we will fulfill and accomplish every resolve and achieve every goal associated with the New India.

This occasion today is also very emotional. The dream that Sardar Patel had seen is being fulfilled after decades and that too is happening in front of those eyes of the grand statue of Sardar Saheb.

We have seen the Sardar Sarovar dam full for the first time. There was a time when reaching the target of 122 meters was considered a great accomplishment. But today, within 5 years, the filling of Sardar Sarovar by 138 meters is amazing and simply unforgettable.

 

Friends, 

Lakhs of people have contributed to bring us to the present day situation. The contribution was made by the most ordinary citizens. The sages and saints have also played an important role. Many social organizations have also contributed. Today is the day to express gratitude to those lakhs of friends who have contributed to this Sardar Sarovar Project. I salute every such person.

 

Friends, 

The enthusiasm in Kevadia today is as much as the enthusiasm in the whole of Gujarat. Today, the work of cleaning drains, ponds, lakes, rivers is being done. In the coming days, a large scale tree planting campaign is also planned. It is certainly a laudable and an admirable work. This is the inspiration on which the Jal-Jeevan mission is going to move forward and the water conservation movement in the country is going to be successful. We have to carry forward the successful experiments in Gujarat, the experiments of public participation, and many important tasks related to public participation. I would urge such friends who have been associated with such kind campaigns through public participation in the villages of Gujarat for decades to share their experiences across the country.

 

Friends, 

Mother Narmada is now blessing those areas of Kutch and Saurashtra today where once water could not reach for many weeks. There were days in Gujarat decades ago when bullets were shot during water wars. The daughters and sisters had to walk 5-5, 10-10 kilometers to make arrangements for drinking water. On the onset of summer the people of Saurashtra and North Gujarat had to travel hundreds of kilometers with their livestock in search of areas with water. There they were forced to leave their houses, villages and fields. I remember that in the summer of 2000, the condition was such that Rajkot had to run a special water train for providing water to Surya Nagar and Jam Nagar for the first time.

 

Friends, 

When we think of those old days today, it seems that Gujarat has come so far today. You are proud or not? Are you happy? When you gave me the responsibility here, the dual challenge before us was to speed up the work of Dam for irrigation, drinking water and electricity. On the other hand, the Narmada canal network was also to be extended and alternative irrigation system was also enhanced. Just imagine, till the year 2001, the work of the main canal could be completed only for 150 kilometers. The irrigation system and the network of canals were unfinished, incomplete and in a limbo. But all of you, the people of Gujarat have never lost courage.

Today, an extensive network of irrigation schemes has emerged in Gujarat. In the last 17-18 years, almost double the land has been brought under irrigation.

 

Brothers and sisters, 

You can imagine that the area under ​​drip irrigation, micro irrigation was only 14 thousand hectares in the year 2001 and about 8000 farmers families only were able to benefit from it. With 'Per drop more crop' campaign, campaign to save water, micro irrigation and drip irrigation today we have about 19 lakh hectares of land under the same micro irrigation. And about 12 lakh farmer families are getting its benefits. This would not have been possible without your cooperation. This was not possible without the sensitivity of the farmers sitting in the villages of Gujarat. The result of Gujarat's farmers accepting new science and technology was that we could accomplish such a big dream. Per drop more crop could reach every field in Gujarat. Recently, IIM Ahmedabad had conducted a study on this. I also want to tell you and the nation about it.

This study revealed that due to micro irrigation like drip and sprinkler irrigation Gujarat has saved water up to 50 per cent. Fertilizer use decreased by 25 per cent. Labor cost was reduced by 40 per cent and additionally savings from electricity were also there. Moreover, on the one hand there was savings while on the other hand there was an increase of up to 30 per cent in crop yield. Also, there was an increase in the income of every farmer family by about fifteen and a half thousand rupees per hectare.

 

Friends, 

I remember that when Narmada water reached Kutch I had said that water would prove to be a paras (philosopher's stone) for Kutch, today I am happy that the water of Mother Narmada is proving to be a paras for not only Kutch and Saurashtra but also for a large part of Gujarat. Narmada water is not just water. It is Paras which turns the soil into gold as soon as it touches the soil. Not only has the Irrigation facility improved due to Narmada water, but the percentage of tap water has also increased almost three times in the last two decades. In the year 2001, only 26 per cent of the households in Gujarat had water from the tap. That is, since the work of providing water through taps in the house started in the country till the year 2001, only 26 per cent houses were covered for nearly 5 decades. Today, as a result of your efforts and Gujarat government's schemes that 78 per cent of the households in the state get water from the tap. Now with this inspiration, we have to achieve the goal of delivering water in every house across the country.

 

Brothers and sisters, 

Today with schemes like SAUNI Yojana, Sujalam-Sufalam Yojana, the villages and cities of Gujarat are fast connecting with water network. I congratulate first the former Chief Minister of the Government of Gujarat Anandiben Patel and the incumbent Chief Minister Rupani ji and the previous governments under which the mission of connecting every house, every field with water was successfully carried out.

 

Friends,

The farmers of Gujarat have benefitted from the irrigation facility. Earlier farmers used to grow traditional crops only. But once the irrigation facilities were provided, the cash crops started to grow and the inclination towards horticulture increased. Recently another study has come out which shows that this change has increased the income of many farming families.

 

Brothers and sisters, 

Many efforts are going on in many directions to double the income of every farming family of the country including Gujarat by 2022. After the formation of the new government, several steps have been taken in this direction in the last 100 days. The benefit of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi is now being extended to every farmer family of Gujarat.

A few days ago a pension scheme for small farmers, small shopkeepers, and small traders has also started. Its benefit will also be given to the farmer families of Gujarat and the country.

 

Friends, 

A comprehensive system of transport via water is also being prepared for farmers, traders and other citizens of Gujarat. I have had the privilege of starting the Ghogha-Dahej Ro-Ro Ferry Service. I have been told that till now more than 1.25 lakh passengers have used this ferry facility. Moreover, about 70 thousand vehicles have also been transported with its help. Imagine, earlier you had to drive around 350 kilometers by road. Now you have to travel only 31 kilometers by sea. Compare the distance of 350 kilometers and 31 kilometers! This facility has increased the convenience of the people and has also saved their time. The environment is also protected and has also facilitated financially.

 

Friends, 

A similar service is being considered from Mumbai to Hazira. The Government of Gujarat has given constitutional consent to this. Work on it will start very soon. Water tourism in Gujarat is also getting boosted by projects like Ro-Ro Ferry.

 

Friends, 

When it comes to tourism, the discussion of the Statue of Unity is natural. Due to this, Kevadia and Gujarat have been prominently on the tourism map of the whole world. It has been inaugurated only about 11 months back; not even a year has passed, but in 11 months so far more than 23 lakh tourists from all over the country and the world have come to see Sardar Patel's Statue of Unity.

On an average 8500 tourists come here every day. I am told that on the day of Janmashtami last month, more than 34 thousand tourists had visited this place. When you see such a big achievement, you can guess that if the average number of people visiting the Statue of Liberty of America is 10,000 per day, although it has been 133 years old, the Statue of Unity is only 11 months old and 8500 tourists visit it per day. The visits made by 23 lakh people in 11 months is a unique wonder in itself.

 

Brothers and sisters, 

The Statue of Unity is also becoming a medium of employment for the tribal brothers and sisters and young friends here. In the near future, when the roads here and other tourism related projects are completed, then the employment opportunities will increase further. Today I had spent most of the time reviewing the progress of the projects here. I was late here for the same reason and there was no traffic for me and even with high speed, it took four hours to reach here and yet I was not able to see the work completely. Work is very extensively here. When the tourists come here in future, they will feel like staying for two or four days. Here a huge market will be available to the tribal companions who produce vegetables, fruits, flowers and milk.

All we have to keep in mind is to protect this area from plastic. The whole country is trying to get rid of single-use plastic. I am aware that all of you are engaged in this work under the cleanliness drive. But let's not forget that our water, our forest and our land should be free from plastic. Our efforts should be expedited for the same, and every citizen should pledge and be committed.

 

Friends, 

As I said in the beginning, 17 September is celebrated as Vishwakarma Day. But with 17 September there is another importance of this day. This day is etched in the pages of history for Sardar saheb and his efforts for the unity of India. A golden chapter has been written on 17 September of his efforts made. Today is also celebrated as Hyderabad Liberation Day. On this day in the year 1948, Hyderabad was merged with India and today Hyderabad is contributing strongly in the development and progress of the country.

Imagine if Sardar Ballabh Bhai and his foresight was not there. If Sardar saheb did not have this work, then how would the map of India be today? The problems of India would have been much greater.

 

Brothers and sisters, 

Today India is witnessing the fulfillment of Sardar's dream of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat'. Today, India is trying to complete the tasks which were left incomplete in the years after independence.

The people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have faced discrimination for 70 years. As a result, the entire India has suffered from the consequences of violence, isolation, and unfulfilled hopes and aspirations.

The country has taken an important decision with the inspiration of Sardar Saheb. It has been decided to walk a new path to solve the decades-old problem.

I am confident that with the active support of lakhs of friends from Ladakh and Kargil in Jammu and Kashmir, we are going to succeed in emanating a new stream of development and confidence.

This servant of yours is fully committed to the unity of India and the excellence of India. We have strengthened this commitment in the last hundred days. Many major decisions have been taken one by one in the last hundred days. It also includes solutions ranging from welfare of farmers to strengthening the infrastructure and economy.

I told you during the election too and I am saying it again today. Our new government will work faster than before, achieving even bigger goals than before.

Once again, I congratulate the entire Gujarat on realizing the spirit of Sardar Saheb. Thank you so much for making me a part of this occasion. I salute all of you, the people of Gujarat and the entire country and world who have showered their blessings on me today keeping Mother Narmada as a witness. I also bow down to her and thank her. Once again raise both hands and say with me .. ... Narmade... your voice should reach Kutch! Narmade... Narmade ... Narmade ....

 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

                 Prime Minister Narendra Modi today attended  the 'Namami Narmada' festival at Kevadiya Gujarat. The festival is being celebrated by the Gujarat government to mark the filling up of the dam to its full reservoir level of 138.68 metres. For the first time since the height of the dam was raised in 2017, the water level reached its highest peak on evening of 16th September.  PM also performed puja at the dam site to welcome the water of river Narmada, the lifeline of Gujarat.

Later, the Prime Minister visited the Khalvani Eco-Tourism site in Kevadiya and a Cactus Garden. At the Butterfly Garden in Kevadiya, the Prime Minister  released a large basket full of butterflies into the park. He also visited the Ekta Nursery, situated in the vicinity of the Statue of Unity. Later the PM addressed a public meeting next to the ‘Statue of Unity’.

PM stated “I am blessed to see water in the SardarSarovar Dam rise above 138 metres. The SardarSarovar Dam is a ray of hope for the people of Gujarat. It is a boon for lakhs of hardworking farmers”.

Comparing the tourist flow at Statue of Unity with Statue of Liberty, the PM said, “Within 11 months of unveiling, the Statue of Unity is attracting tourist footfall which is almost on par with the 133-year-old Statue of Liberty. Kevadiya and Gujarat are on the world tourism map because of the Statue of Unity. I am told over 23 lakh tourists from India and across the world have visited this place in the last 11 months”. The Statue of Liberty attracts on average 10,000 tourists every day. But you need to keep in mind that it is 133 years old. On the other hand, Statue of Unity is just 11 months old. Despite that, it is attracting over 8,500 tourists every day. This is a miracle, he said.
The Statue of Unity was opened to the public on October 31, 2018 to mark the birth anniversary of the country's  first home minister.

The Prime Minister lauded the vision of Sardar Patel, adding that the government’s decision last month on Jammu and Kashmir was an inspiration from the former home minister of India. And the decision to bifurcate the state into two union territories are inspired by Sardar Patel and is an attempt to find solution to a decades-old problem. PM said that he is confident of bringing prosperity and trust to Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakhwith the active support of millions of colleagues.

The Prime Minister said, “Your servant is fully committed to the unity and superiority of India. We have strengthened this commitment over the last 100 days, and the new government will work faster than before, will achieve bigger goals than before”.

                In another major effort to secure the lives of the farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana at Ranchi, the Capital of Jharkhand.

The Scheme shall secure the lives of 5 Crore Small and Marginal Farmers by providing a minimum pension of Rs 3000 per month, to those who attain 60 years of age.

Prime Minister also launched the National Pension Scheme for the Traders and The Self-Employed.

The scheme aims at providing a minimum assured pension of Rs 3000, to small traders and self - employed after attaining the age of 60 Years.

Around 3 Crore Small traders would be benefitted from the scheme.

PM stated that the electoral promise of a strong government that will fulfill your aspirations is delivered.

“I said that every farmer family of the country will get the benefit of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi after the formation of the new government. Today, more than 21 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the accounts of about six and a half crore farmer families of the country. There are also 8 lakh farmer families of Jharkhand, in whose account about two hundred and fifty crores have been deposited.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated “Development is our priority as well as commitment. Our government is trying to provide a shield of social security to every Indian.”

“Government is becoming the companion of those who need it the most. Since March this year, a similar pension scheme is going on for crores of unorganized sector workers of the country.”

“More than 32 lakh laborers have also joined the Shramayogi Manadhan Yojana. More than 22 crore people have joined Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, out of which more than 30 lakh beneficiaries are from Jharkhand only. Also under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 44 lakh poor patients have been benefitted, out of which about 3 lakh are from Jharkhand.”

In an effort to empower all, the Prime Minister today launched 462 Ekalavya Model Schools across the country in Tribal Dominated Areas. The schools would focus to provide quality upper primary, secondary and senior secondary level education to ST Students in these areas.

“These  Eklavya schools will not only serve as  medium of education for tribal children but there will also be facilities for sports and skill development along with protection of local arts and culture.In these schools, the government will spend more than one lakh rupees a year on every tribal child.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also inaugurated the Multi-Modal Transport Terminal at Sahibganj.

“Today I also have the privilege of inaugurating the Sahibganj multi-modal terminal. This is not just another project, but is giving a new option of transportation to this entire region. This waterway will connect Jharkhand not only with the whole country, but also with foreign countries. From this terminal, the tribal brothers and sisters, farmers here, will now be able to access their produce in the markets across the country more easily, PM added.”

The Prime Minister also inaugurated the New Vidhan Sabha Building of Jharkhand.

 “Today, nearly two decades after the formation of the state, the temple of democracy is being inaugurated in Jharkhand. This building is the holy place where the foundation of the golden future of the people of Jharkhand will be laid and dreams of present and future generations will be realized”.  PM also laid the foundation stone of the new building of the Secretariat.

The Prime Minister exhorted the country to reduce the usage of Single-Use Plastic.

Referring to the Swachhata Hi Seva Programme launched on the 11th September 2019, the Prime Minister said, “Since yesterday, the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign has started in the country. Under this campaign, by October 2, we have to collect single-use plastic in our homes, schools, offices. On October 2, the day of Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, we have to remove that plastic pile”.

Bharat Mata ki jai! 

Bharat Mata ki jai! 

All the dignitaries present on stage and all my dear brothers and sisters who have come from far-fetched areas in large numbers.
After the formation of the new government, Jharkhand is one of the few states that I have got the opportunity to visit first. I remember, it was morning time and we were all doing yoga and a light rainfall was also blessing us at this very Prabhat Tara Maidan. Today when I came to this ground again, many old memories flashed before my eyes. This is the ground from where Ayushman Bharat scheme was launched last September.

Friends, 

Today I am fortunate to add one more thing to the identity of Jharkhand. Brothers and sisters, your Jharkhand is going to be known as the launching pad for major schemes pertaining to the welfare of the poor and tribal communities. That is, when there will be a discussion in the country about which state started the major schemes related to the poor, the name of Jharkhand will come up in most of the discussions. The world's largest health assurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was started from Jharkhand and today lakhs of people of the country who could not get treatment due to lack of money have been treated. They are showering their blessings. That blessing is also reaching Jharkhand.


Today, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Mandhan Yojana, which ensures pension to crores of farmers across the country, is also starting from the land of Birsa Munda in Jharkhand. Besides, the National Pension Scheme for crores of businessmen and self-employed in the country is also being launched from Jharkhand. I congratulate the farmers and traders across the country from this great land.

That is, we have given a scheme of pension to the workers of the unorganized sector of the country; later the pension scheme was launched for the farmers and thereafter for the businessmen and self-employed. In a way, we are ensuring that those sections of the society that play a major role in building the country should not face trouble in their old age. This pension scheme guarantees the same.

Friends, 

Today I am also fortunate to inaugurate the Sahibganj Multi-Modal Terminal and our Minister Mr. Mansukh Mandaviya is sitting there. Many people of Santhal Pargana have also become witnesses to this very important occasion. And this project is not just about Jharkhand, it will also give a new identity to Jharkhand, the entire country as well as the world. This is not just another project, but is also giving a new option of transportation to this entire region.

This terminal is an important part of the National Water Way -1 Haldia-Banaras Waterways Development Project. This waterway will connect Jharkhand not only with the whole country, but also with foreign countries. Immense possibilities of development are going to open up for the people of Jharkhand through this project. With this terminal, the tribal brothers and sisters and the farmers here will be able to take their produce now more easily to the markets across the country. Similarly, through the waterway, the produce of Jharkhand will easily reach the markets of the North Eastern states of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya as well as the North India besides Jharkhand. This terminal will also create new employment opportunities. This waterway will prove to be very beneficial from the point of view of both progress and environment conservation and the costs of transportation by water route are much lesser than by road. Its benefit will also trickle down to every producer, businessman, and buyer.

Brothers and sisters, 

During the elections I had promised you to give a strong government and a government that delivers; a government that will work faster than ever before; a government that will put all its energy to meet your expectations. In the last hundred days, the country has seen its trailer; the entire film is yet to be seen.

 

Our pledge is to deliver water to every house and today the country has set out to fulfill the Jal-Jeevan Mission. Our resolve is to protect the rights of Muslim sisters, and within hundred days a stringent law has been enacted against triple talaq.

Our pledge is that of a decisive fight against terrorism. In the first hundred days, the anti-terror law has been strengthened.

Our resolve is to take Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to new heights of development. We have started it within a hundred days.

Our resolve is to send those who looted the public to their rightful place. And this is also working very fast. And some people have already gone to jail.

Brothers and sisters, I said that every farmer family of the country will get the benefit of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi after the formation of new government. This promise has been fulfilled and now more and more farmers are being connected to this scheme.

Today, more than 21 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the accounts of about six and a half crore farmer families of the country. Today I am satisfied that in this entire scheme 8 lakh farmer families of my Jharkhand have also become its beneficiaries; about two and a half crore rupees have been deposited in their accounts. There is no middleman. No recommendation is needed.  It is said in Bengal ‘if you get the money then you will have to give cut-money to someone’. No.  Here the money is deposited directly into the accounts of the farmers.

Brothers and sisters, today is a historic day for Jharkhand. Today, the new building of the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly has been inaugurated and the foundation stone of the new Secretariat building has also been laid. Nearly two decades after the formation of the state, the temple of democracy is being inaugurated in Jharkhand today. This is not just a building; it is not a structure of four walls; this building is such a holy place where the foundation of the golden future of the people of Jharkhand will be laid. This building is a pilgrimage for every citizen who believes in democracy. Through this temple of democracy, the dreams of present and future generations of Jharkhand will be realized. I would like the bold, brave and talented youth of Jharkhand to visit the new assembly building. Whenever one gets a chance, after four months, six months or a year, one must visit it.

Friends, you must have heard a lot about the session of Parliament this time.  Every citizen of India became happy witnessing the way our Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were run after the formation of the new government, after the formation of the new parliament. This happened because this time the Monsoon Session of Parliament was one of the most productive sessions in the history of independent India. The whole country saw how the time of Parliament was fruitfully utilized in the monsoon session. Parliament session continued till late in the night. The debate continued for hours, during which a number of important topics were intensely discussed and laws necessary for the country were enacted.

Friends, the credit for the smooth functioning of Parliament also goes to all MPs, all political parties and all their leaders. I congratulate all the MPs; congratulations to the countrymen.

Friends; development is our priority as well as our commitment. Our promise of development is also an equally strong intention. Today, the country is moving forward at such a great pace that has not been witnessed earlier. The kind of change that is taking place in the country today could not have been thought of before. People who used to think that they are above the law of the country, above the courts of the country, are seeking bail from the court today.

Brothers and sisters, do you want to see a government that works fast like this? Are you happy with our hundred days of work? Are you happy?  Am I doing the right thing? Am I going in the right direction? I am getting your blessings and I hope I will continue to get it. It is just a beginning. Five years left; many resolutions are to be accomplished; a lot of efforts are to be made; a lot of hard work still to be done. In this process, historical schemes have been started a short while ago for the welfare of small farmers, shopkeepers and traders. I would urge small farmers, shopkeepers and traders from all over the country, including Jharkhand, to take advantage of these schemes.

Brothers and sisters, 

Our government is trying to provide a shield of social security to every Indian. The government is standing with those who need help the most. Since March this year, a similar pension scheme is going on for crores of unorganized sector workers of the country. So far, more than 32 lakh labourers have joined the Shram Yogi Mandhan Yojana.

Friends, 

Till five years ago, life insurance or accident insurance for the poor was beyond their imagination. One reason was the lack of information, and those who had the knowledge, on seeing high premium, had to think a hundred times. They thought they should worry about the current situation of arranging food instead of thinking about old age. We have tried to change this situation.

Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana have been placed in front of the common man of the country for just 90 paise. Can you imagine that insurance of two lakh rupees has been ensured under both the schemes at the rate of only 90 paise per day and one rupee per month? So far, more than 22 crore countrymen have joined these two schemes and out of which more than 30 lakh are from Jharkhand. Besides, through these two schemes, claims of more than Rs.3500 crore have been received by the people so far.

Brothers and sisters,

Just like insurance, treatment for serious illnesses was almost impossible for the poor person. We brought the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana that was launched from Jharkhand. Under this scheme, about 44 lakh poor patients have got the benefit of treatment so far, out of which about 3 lakh people are from Jharkhand. Over 7 thousand crore rupees have been paid to hospitals for the same. The poor are getting the benefits of treatment under Ayushman Bharat and they are also free from the burden of debt. Now the poor doesn't have to go to the moneylender and pay huge amount of interest for his treatment.


Brothers and sisters, when the poor is less concerned about his daily life and the struggle minimizes in everyday life, then he gets so much strength that he starts trying to get himself out of poverty. Our government, whether it has been at the center or in Jharkhand, has made sincere efforts to make the life of the poor and the tribal society easier.


There was a time, when the children of the poor were left out of vaccination and fell prone to serious diseases with age. We started Mission Indradhanush to ensure vaccination for children even in remote areas of the country.

There was a time when the poor faced difficulty in even opening a bank account. We have helped to open bank accounts of 37 crore poor people in the country through the Jan Dhan Yojana.

There was a time, when it was difficult for the poor to get cheap government houses. We have built more than 2 crore houses for our poor through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Now work is going on for 2 crore more houses.

Friends, 

There was a time when the poor did not have toilet facilities. We have removed that pain from the lives of poor sisters and daughters by constructing more than 10 crore toilets.

There was a time when the lives of poor sisters and daughters were getting ruined due to the kitchen smoke. We have given 8 crore gas connections free of charge, have protected their health, and have made their lives easier.

Brothers and sisters,

There is no area upon which the government has not worked. The dignity of the poor, his health, his treatment, his medicine, his insurance security, his pension, his children's education, his income, and everything else has been kept in mind. Such schemes not only empower the poor, but also infuse new confidence in life. And when we talk about confidence, the discussion on the children of our tribal society is quite natural. Today, a huge project has been started to improve the education and skills of tribal children, tribal youth and tribal daughters. The initiative to build 462 Eklavya Model Residential Schools across the country has started from here today from the soil of Jharkhand, i.e. from the land of Birsa Munda.  And its benefit will especially go to the brothers and sisters of my tribal community in Jharkhand. These Ekalavya schools are not only the medium of education for tribal children, but also the medium of honing the children's skills in different hobbies and sports. The facilities for conservation of local arts and culture are also available. You will be surprised to know that in these schools, the government will spend more than one lakh rupees every year on every tribal child. I am sure that those who will come out after learning from these schools will play a very big role in building a New India in the near future.

Friends,

Work on other means of connectivity is also underway in Jharkhand. In areas where it was difficult to come out after sun-set, today roads are being built and the streets are full of hustle and bustle. Highway Projects worth more than nine thousand crore rupees have been approved for Jharkhand alone, many of which have already been completed. In the coming days, the National Highway will be further expanded under the Bharatmala Scheme. In addition to roadways, highways and waterways, work is on to strengthen the connectivity of railways and airways.

All these works of development that have been done in the last five years has been possible because of the hard work of our friend Raghubar Das ji and his team as well as your blessings. The Raghubar Das government of Jharkhand has made every effort to bring about a change in the prevailing situation that was plagued by scams and lack of transparency in governance during the previous regime.

Brothers and sisters,

As so much is happening, may I ask you, the people of Jharkhand, to take up a responsibility as well? Since yesterday, the ‘Swachhata Hi Seva’ campaign has started in the country. Under this campaign till October 2, we have to ensure cleanliness in our homes, schools, offices, villages and in the neighborhood; but we also have to do a special work together. We have to collect single-use plastic and store it in one place. This type of plastic is the one which comes in handy only once; then it becomes useless and thus becomes a problem. By collecting all such plastic in one place, we have to get rid of that plastic.

On October 2, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we have to remove that plastic pile. The government is mobilizing all the departments so that this plastic can be collected and recycled later. I appeal to the people of Jharkhand, the nature lovers of Jharkhand to take part in this campaign and to lead the country in liberating the country from single-use plastics.

Friends,

Now for the new Jharkhand, for the New India, we all have to work together, and have to take the country forward together.  In the next 5 years, Jharkhand will again ride a ‘double engine’ of development with this belief I conclude my speech. 

 Many greetings to the people of Jharkhand and to the countrymen for the various schemes launched today and thank you all! With both fists closed and both hands up, say loudly – ‘Bharat Mata ki – Jai’! Your voice should reach every village in Jharkhand!

 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Thanks a lot!

                I pay homage to the holy soil of Brajbhoomi which is a witness to the birth of Lord Shri Krishna and Shri Radha ji . 'Radhe-Radhe' to all the Brajwasis who have come here!

Once again 'Radhe-Radhe' to all my dear farmer and cattle herder brothers and sisters who have gathered here in large numbers! 

After the new mandate, I have had the privilege of coming to the city of Kanha for the first time.  Once again, I and all my colleagues have received many blessings from Mathura and the entire Uttar Pradesh.  I bow my head down to the land of Braj, thanking you for your cooperation and for making decisions in the interest of the country.  We have shown unprecedented work in the last hundred days as per the wish of all of you.  I am sure that your support and cooperation for the development of the country will continue to be with us.

Friends, 

Brajbhoomi has always inspired the whole country, the world, the lives and the entire humanity.  Today, the whole world is looking for role models in the world to protect the environment, to save trees and plants; but India always had a source of inspiration like Lord Shri Krishna whose reference is incomplete without environmental love.

Just imagine, can Sri Krishna's picture be complete without Kalindi which is known as Yamuna, Vaijayanti Mala, peacock feather, bamboo flute, the shade of Kadam tree and cow-herds grazing green grass?  Can anyone imagine Bal-Gopal without milk, curd and butter?

Friends, 

Just as our God is incomplete without nature, environment and livestock, similarly India too will seem incomplete without these.

Environment and livestock have always been a very important part of India's economic thinking.  This is the reason why be it Swachh Bharat Mission, Jal Jeevan Mission, or encouraging agriculture and animal husbandry, we are moving towards a strong and New India by balancing nature and economic development.

Brothers and sisters, 

Taking this idea forward, we have taken many big resolutions here today.  And I believe that there can be no place in India better than Brajbhumi to start such a programme for the country's crores of animals, for the environment and tourism.

The 'Swachhata Hi Seva Abhiyan' has been launched a short while ago.  The National Animal Disease Control programme has also been launched.  Some other schemes related to animal health, nutrition and dairy industry have also been started.

Besides this, the inauguration and foundation stone-laying ceremony of several projects related to infrastructure and tourism of Mathura have taken place today.  Wish you all the best for these schemes and projects, and many congratulations. It is a matter of pleasure for me that today, in all the agricultural science centers of India, thousands of farmers of those regions have gathered and are witnessing this programme.  A number of farmers and herders today are directly connected with Brajbhoomi through technology.  I salute them.  My best wishes to them too.

Friends, a few days from now, our country will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.  It is the responsibility of all the Indians to learn from Mahatma Gandhi's insistence upon nature and cleanliness.  And this will be the best possible way of paying homage to him.  'Mahatma Gandhi 150' is the year of inspiration. The same sentiment is attached to 'Swachhta Hi Seva' as well.  Starting today, this campaign has been dedicated exclusively to free the country from plastic waste.

 

Brothers and sisters, 

The problem arising out of plastic is getting serious with time.  You Brajwasis know very well how plastic is causing animal deaths.  Similarly, it becomes difficult for the organisms and fishes living in rivers, lakes and ponds to survive after swallowing the plastic there.  So now we have to get rid of the single-use plastic, a plastic that we throw away after using it once.  We have to try to make our homes, our offices, our work places free of single-use plastic by 2nd October this year.

I urge all Self-Help Groups, civil societies, social organizations, youth organizations, women's circles, clubs, schools and colleges, government and private institutions, and  individuals working in villages and across the country  to join this campaign.  We have to do this for the bright future of your children.  The administration will take care of the plastic waste collected by you and then it will be recycled.  The waste that cannot be recycled will be used in cement factories, or in road construction.

Brothers and sisters, 

I had the opportunity to meet some women who segregate different types of plastic just a short while ago.  Most of this plastic is recycled.  This is also a source of income for those women.  I believe that this kind of work needs to be done in every village.  This idea of ​​waste to wealth means we will protect our environment and make the environment around us clean.

 

Friends, 

Apart from the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign, we also have to make some changes in our habits.  I have told you about this from the ramparts of Red Fort too.  Today I am raising this topic again. We have to decide that whenever we go to the shop, to the market, to get vegetables or for shopping, then we should carry our personal bags along with us.  Be sure to carry a cloth or a jute bag.  We must ensure that shoppers should make minimum use of plastic for packaging.  I am also in favour of using metallic utensils or clay pots in government offices and government programmes instead of plastic bottles.

Friends, 

When the environment is clean and there is no dirt around, then it has a direct and positive effect also on health.  I would praise Yogi ji's government for working very seriously on cleanliness and health.  This is the result of the efforts of his government and the details of which have been given by Yogi Ji. When Yogi ji was the Member of the Parliament, in every session, he used to draw the attention of the country towards the painful 'brain fever'. He used to try to awaken the country by telling painful stories.  Thousands of children used to die. When Yogi ji's government was formed, it was just a beginning, yet some vested interest groups had tried to blame the same Yogi ji for the ordeal who had fought against this disease for his entire life and had awakened the Parliament and the country about it.  But Yogi ji was not deterred. He was not afraid.  He didn't let go of the matter for which he was continuously working for the last 30-40 years. I do not know whether the data you are seeing will catch the attention of the media or not.  But the country must pay attention to the fact that we have lost thousands of our children to such a serious disease, the root cause of which is unhygienic conditions.  Yogi ji's government is moving ahead with a lot of success. I congratulate the citizens, families, institutions, governments and everyone associated with this sacred and humanitarian work of saving the lives of the children by stressing on cleanliness. I express my gratitude to them.

Friends, 

Another topic related to environment and health is water scarcity and the remedy is Jal Jeevan Mission.  Under this mission, emphasis is being laid on water conservation and water supply to every household.  The people of our villages, the farmers and particularly our mothers and sisters will get the greatest benefit of the Jal Jeevan Mission. Reduced expenditure on water means, their savings will also increase.

Friends, 

Animal husbandry and other businesses also play a major role in increasing the income of the farmers.  Be it animal husbandry, fish farming, poultry or bee keeping, the investment made in these professions, brings more earnings.  Over the last 5 years, we have moved forward with many new approaches on alternative options related to agriculture.

All the necessary steps have been taken to improve the aspects ranging from quality and health of livestock to a variety of dairy products.  To ensure the quality of milk-producing animals, National Gokul Mission was started first; and this year it has been decided to create Kamdhenu Commission for taking proper care of animals across the country.  Consequently, the milk production has increased by about seven per cent in the last five years.  Besides, an average increase of about 13 per cent has been registered in the income of farmers and cattle-keepers.

And let me tell you my experience. Rwanda is a small country in Africa.  I went there last year and some people had created hullabaloo saying Modi ji went to Rwanda and arranged a programme to present 250 cows; but the entire story was not brought before the country.  A country like Rwanda in Africa is running a wonderful scheme there. The government of Rwanda gives cows to the people of villages and there is a rule that the government will take away the first calf of that cow and give it to those who do not have a cow. This whole chain keeps running and their effort is to ensure that every household in every village has a cow and the cow, animal husbandry and milk production become the backbone of Rwanda's economy.  They have planned this very well.  And I also got a chance to visit a village of Rwanda.  I got the opportunity to inaugurate this scheme and to witness how the entire network was created to earn a livelihood in the villages through animal husbandry, especially through cow's milk.  I have seen it myself.  But our country is unfortunate as some people become frightened when they hear the word 'Om' or 'cow' and they think that the country has been driven back into the sixteenth-seventeenth century.  Such knowledge and such people have left no stone unturned to ruin the country.  And so livestock is a very valuable thing in our Indian rural economy. Can anyone imagine the economy without livestock? Can a village or a family in a village imagine their lives without livestock? But some people get shocked by hearing certain words.

Friends, 

The seriousness of the government regarding livestock can be gauged from the fact that one of the major decisions taken in the hundred days after the formation of the government is related to the vaccination of animals.  The National Veterinary Control Program and the Artificial Insemination Program have been launched to expand this campaign.

Friends, 

You all know very well that the livestock falling sick comes as a major shock.  Today, a major campaign of Rs. 13 thousand crores has been started with the objective to ensure that our animals do not fall ill again and again, so that farmers do not have to spend unnecessarily on their treatment.  We are starting a comprehensive campaign to free the animals from this disease called FMD, i.e. Foot and Mouth Disease.

In some areas of Uttar Pradesh, the term used for FMD, i.e. Foot and Mouth Disease is 'Muh-paka'.  This is the campaign to get rid of this disease.  And you will be surprised that many countries of the world have campaigned in their countries and have freed the animals from this disease.  Many small countries and poor countries have worked towards it.  But unfortunately here so many governments have come and gone without working on this campaign. So we could not get results. 

If the poor, small countries of the world could get the animal out of trouble, then no animal on Sri Krishna's land should live in such a condition. And to get rid of the diseases, 51 crore cows, buffalo, sheep goats and pigs will be vaccinated twice a year. Moreover, the animals that will be vaccinated will be tagged in the ears and will be given a unique ID called 'Pashu Aadhaar'. Health cards will also be issued to the animals.

Brothers and sisters, 

The objective of these programmes is very clear; that is, our livestock should be healthy and nourished. Besides, new and the best quality animal breeds should also be developed. By following this path, the income of our animal-keepers will also increase.  Our children will also have access to a fair share of milk and India will also be recognized as the world's largest milk producer.

Brothers and sisters, 

To expand India's dairy sector, we need innovation and new technology.  These innovations should also involve our rural society. So, today as I am starting the Startup Grand Challenge, I especially invite the youth, the promising youngsters of the country who work on Startup in Bangalore, Hyderabad and also the bright students of IIT, to come forward and join the Startup Grand Challenge.  We have to find the solutions on how to arrange green fodder and how the cattle should get access to nutritious food.  What could be the cheapest and the easiest alternative of plastic bags?  Startups providing solutions to many such issues should be established and the Government of India is launching that challenge in front of you today.  Come, come out with new ideas. The solutions to the problems of the country will come out of the soil of the same country; this is my belief.

I assure my young friends that their ideas will be seriously considered. They will be taken forward and necessary investment arrangements will also be made.  This will also create many new employment opportunities.

Friends, 

This entire Braj region including Mathura is a place of spirituality and faith.  There are immense possibilities of heritage tourism here.  I am happy that Yogi ji's government is actively working in this direction.

Today in Mathura, Nandgaon, Govardhan and Barsana several projects related to beautification or connectivity were inaugurated and the foundation stones were laid.  The facilities that will be built here will boost the tourism of not only UP but the whole country.  The way tourism has been promoted in the last 5 years has brought a huge improvement in India's ranking.  A few days ago, global ranking of tourism was announced in which India reached number 34; while in 2013 India was ranked number 65. This improved ranking of India is also a witness to the fact that new employment opportunities have continued in this sector as well.

Friends, 

This day of September 11 is special for another reason. A century ago, on this day, Swami Vivekananda had delivered his historic speech in Chicago.  Through that speech, the whole world had understood the culture of India and our traditions more deeply.  In his address, Swami Vivekananda had also put forward the vision of India for world peace.  But look at the misfortune, on September 11, on 9/11, there was such a major terrorist attack in America that shook the world.

Brothers and sisters, 

Today terrorism has become an ideology that is not limited to any border. It is a global problem. It has become a global faith, whose strong roots are flourishing in our neighbourhood.  Today, the whole world needs to take resolution and strong action is needed against those who pursue this ideology and those who shelter and train terrorists.  India is fully capable of meeting this challenge at its own level.  We have also proved it and will further prove it.  The recent decision to toughen the anti-terror law is also an attempt in this direction.  Now the terrorists will not be able to hide their activities by renaming the organizations.

Brothers and sisters, 

Whether the problem is of terror, of pollution or of disease, we have to defeat them together.  Let us move ahead with determination and try to achieve the purpose for which we have gathered here today. Once again I congratulate you all for all the new development projects.  My heartfelt gratitude to all of you!  Say with me loudly and with both hands up ...

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the National Animal Disease Control Programme (NACDP) to control and eradicate the Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis amongst the livestock in the country, at Mathura today.

The 12,652 Crore fully Central Government sponsored programme will vaccinate over 600 million cattle in the country in an effort to mitigate the two diseases.

The Prime Minister also launched the National Artificial Insemination Programme and a country wide workshop in all the KrishiVIgyanKendras(KVKs) in all the 687 Districts of the country on vaccination and disease management, Artificial Insemination and Productivity.

Addressing a huge gathering the Prime Minister said, “Environment and Livestock were always at the core of India’s economic thought and philosophy. And hence be it Swachh Bharat or Jal Jeevan Mission or promoting Agriculture & Animal Husbandry we always try to maintain a balance between Nature and Economy. And this is what enables us to build a strong new India.”

The Prime Minister also launched the Swachhta Hi Seva Programme with focus on reducing the usage of Single Use Plastic in the country.

“We should all try that by the 2nd of October this year our homes, offices, work places should be rid of the Single Use Plastic”.

“I appeal to all the Self Help Groups, Civil Society, NGOs, and Women & Youth Organisations, every college, every school, every Government and Private Organisation, every individual to join in this campaign against Single Use Plastic”

“We should look for cheaper and easier alternatives for polythene bags. So many solutions can be found through our Start Ups.”

The Prime Minister also launched several other programmes concerning Livestock Health, Nutrition and Dairy Farming.

“Animal Husbandry and other allied activities have a greater role to play in increasing the farmers’ income. Investments in Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, bee-keeping etcbring in more returns”

“In the last five years we have moved ahead with a new approach towards farming and allied activities. We have taken the necessary steps to improve the quality of livestock, dairy products and diversify them.”

“We need to find an appropriate solution for the regular supply of green fodder and nutritious diet to the livestock.

“Innovation and new technology is the need of the hour, to expand the Dairy Sector in India. We have launched the “Start up Brand Challenge” so that these innovations could come from our villages. “

“I want to assure my young friends that their ideas will be given a serious consideration to take them ahead and find suitable investment for them. This will create newer opportunities of employment”.

                Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi addressed the High Level Segment of the 14th Conference of Parties (COP14) of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) today, at Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh. 

 

The PM said that India looks forward to making an effective contribution as we take over the co presidency for a two year term. For ages we in India have always given importance to land. In Indian culture the Earth is held as sacred and treated as a mother.

 

 “You will be shocked to know that desertification affects over two third of countries of the world. This makes a compelling case for action on land front combined with the action to address water crisis facing the world. Because when we address degraded lands we also address water scarcity issue. Augmenting water supply, enhancing water recharge, slowing down water run off and retaining moisture in the soil are all parts of a holistic land and water strategy. I call upon the leadership of UNCCD to create a Global Water Action Agenda which is central to the land degradation neutrality strategy”, the PM added.

 

PM said “Today I was reminded of the India’s Indices that were submitted at the Paris COP at the UNFCCC. It highlighted india’s deep cultural roots of maintaining a healthy balance between land, water, air trees and all living beings. Friends it would make you happy that India had been able to increase its tree cover. Between 2015 to 2017 India’s tree and forest cover had been increased by 0.8 Million Hectares”.

 

PM stated that the government has launched a program to double the income of farmers by increasing crop yield through various measures. This includes land restoration and micro irrigation. We are working with the motto of per drop more crop. We are increasing the use of bio fertilisers and reducing the use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers. We have created Jal Shakti Ministry to address all water related important issues in totality. And India would put an end to single waste plastic in the coming years.

 

PM said “Friends human empowerment is closely linked to the state of environment. Be it harnessing water resources or reducing the usage of single use plastic, the way ahead is behavioural change. It is only when all sections of society decide to achieve something we can see the desired results. We may introduce any number of frameworks but the real change will be powered by teamwork on the ground. India saw this in the case of the Swachcha Bharat Mission, people from all walks of life took part and ensured sanitation coverage, which is up from 38 percent in 2014 to 99 percent today”.

 

The PM reiterated India’s commitment to the global land agenda. “I also offer India’s support to those countries who may like to understand and adopt some of the LDN (Land Degradation Neutrality) Strategies that have succeeded in India. From this forum I would like to announce that India would raise its ambition of the total area that would be restored from its land degradation status from 21 Million Hectares to 26 Million Hectares between now and 2030”, PM added.

 

PM said that in order to further develop a scientific approach and facilitate induction of technology to land degradation issues, we have decided to set up a centre for excellence in India at the Indian Council for Forest Research and Education. This will actively engage, to promote South-South cooperation with those who wish to access knowledge, technology and training of manpower to address land degradation related issues.

 

Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi concluded his address with ‘ओम्द्यौःशान्तिः, अन्तरिक्षंशान्तिः’, elaborating that the word Shanti does not only refer to peace or the anti-dote to violence. Here, it refers to prospering. Everything has a law of being, a purpose and everybody has to fulfil that purpose.The fulfilment of that purpose is prosperity. So, it says- may the skies, heaven and space prosper.

                I welcome you all to India for the 14th session of the COP to the UN convention to combat desertification. for the UN Combat Desertification. I thank the executive secretary Mr Ibrahim Jio for having brought this convention to India. The record registration for this convention reflects the global Commitment to the task of reversing land degradation.

India also looks forward to making an effective contribution as we take over the co presidency for a two year term.

Friends For ages we in India have always given importance to land. In Indian culture the Earth is held as sacred. And treated as a mother.

While getting up in morning when we touch the earth with our feet we seek forgiveness of mother earth by praying



Samudra-Vasane Devi Parvata-Stana-Mandale | 
Vissnnu-Patni Namas-Tubhyam Paada-Sparsham Kshamasva-Me.

Friends Climate and environment impact both biodiversity and land. It is widely accepted that the world is facing the negative impact of climate change. This is seen in loss of land and plants and animal species, facing threat of becoming extinct. Climate change is also leading to land degradation of various kinds, be it due to rise in sea levels and wave action, erratic rainfall storms &sand storms caused by hot temperatures.

Ladies and Gentlemen, India has hosted global gathering through the COP for all the three conventions. This reflects our commitment to addressing all the three main concerns of the Rio Convention.

Going forward India would be happy proposing initiatives for greater South - South Cooperation on addressing the issue of climate change, bio diversity and land degradation.

Friends you will be shocked to know that desertification affects over 23rds of countries of the world. This makes a compelling case for action on land front combine this with the water crisis facing the world. Because when we address degraded lands we also address water scarcity issue.

Augmenting water supply enhancing water recharge, slowing down water run off and retaining moisture in the soil are all parts of a holistic land and water strategy. I call upon the leadership of UNCCD to create a Global Water Action Agenda which is central to the land degradation neutrality strategy. 

Friends, restoring the health of land is critical for sustainable development. Today I was reminded of the India’s Indices that were submitted at the Paris COP at the UNFCCC

It highlighted india’s deep cultural roots of maintaining a healthy balance between land, water, air trees and all living beings. Friends it would make you happy that India had been able to increase its tree cover. Between 2015 to 2017 India’s tree and forest cover had been increased by 0.8 Mn Hectares.

In India any diversion of forest land for development purposes has to be compensated by making an equivalent land mass available for afforestation. It is also required that a monetary payment of the value of timber which such forest land would have yielded.

Am happy to share that only last week funds amounting to nearly 6 Billion USD, means 40 to 50,000 crore Rupees have been released to the provincial governments in lieu of such diversion for development of forest lands.

My government has launched a program to double the income of the farmers by increasing crop yield through various measures. This includes land restoration and micro irrigation. We are working with the motto of per drop more crop.  At the same time we are also focusing on zero budget natural farming. We have also introduced a scheme to determine the soil quality of each of the farms and are issuing soil health cards to the farmers. This enables them to grow right type of crops, fertilisers, and use the right quantity of water. So far about 217 Million Soil Health Cards have been distributed. We are increasing the use of bio fertilisers and reducing the use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers.

Water management is another important issue we have created Jal Shakti Ministry to address all water related important issues in totality. Recognizing the value of water in all forms we enforced Zero liquid discharge in many industrial processes. The regulatory regime, Provides for treatment of waste water to a degree that it can be put back into the river system without harming life in water. Friends I would like to draw your attention to another form of land degradation which if not prevented could be impossible to reverse. This is the menace of plastic waste. Apart from having adverse health implications, this is going to render lands unproductive and unfit for agriculture.

My government has announced that India would put an end to single waste plastic in the coming years. We are committed to the development of environment friendly substitutes and also an efficient plastic collection and disposal method.

I believe the time has come for even the world to say good bye to single use Plastic.

Friends human empowerment is closely linked to the state of environment be it harnessing water resources or reducing the usage of single use plastic, the way ahead is behavioural change. It is only when all sections of society decide to achieve something we can see the desired results.

We may introduce any number of frameworks but the real change will be powered by teamwork on the ground. India saw this in the case of the Swachcha Bharat Mission, people from all walks of life took part and ensured sanitation coverage, which is up from 38 percent in 2014 to 99 percent today.

I am seeing the same spirit when it comes to ensuring the end of single use plastic, youngsters in particular are more supportive and are taking the lead to bring positive change. The media is also playing a very valuable role.

Friends I would like to make further commitment to the global land agenda, I also offer India’s support to those countries who may like to understand and adopt some of the LDN (Land Degradation Neutrality) Strategies that have succeeded in India. From this forum I would like to announce that India would raise its ambition of the total area that would be restored from its land degradation status from 21 Million Hectares to 26 Million Hectares between now and 2030.

This will support India’s large commitment to achieve an additional Carbon Sin between 2.5 Bn MT to 3 Bn MT through tree cover.

We in India take pride in using remote sensing and space technology for multiple applications including land restoration. India would be happy to help other friendly countries develop land restoration strategies, through cost effective satellite and space technology.

In order to further develop a scientific approach and facilitate induction of technology to land degradation issues, we have decided to set up a centre for excellence in India at the Indian Council for Forest Research and Education. This will actively engage, to promote South-South cooperation with those who wish to access knowledge, technology and training of manpower to address land degradation related issues.

Friends I understand that an ambitious new Delhi declaration is being considered. We are all aware that the Sustainable Development Goals have to be achieved by 2030 of which attainment of LDN is also a part. I wish you well as you deliberate further towards proposing a global strategy for Land Degradation Neutrality.

 

I would end by saying a very popular prayer from one of our oldest scriptures:

 

ओम् द्यौः शान्तिः, अन्तरिक्षं शान्तिः

 

The word Shanti does not only refer to peace or the anti-dote to violence. Here, it refers to prospering. Everything has a law of being, a purpose and everybody has to fulfil that purpose.

 

The fulfilment of that purpose is prosperity.

 

ओम् द्यौः शान्तिः, अन्तरिक्षं शान्तिः

 

So, it says- may the skies, heaven and space prosper.

 

पृथिवी शान्तिः,

आपः शान्तिः,

ओषधयः शान्तिः, वनस्पतयः शान्तिः, विश्वेदेवाः शान्तिः,

ब्रह्म शान्तिः

 

May Mother Earth prosper.

 

This includes the flora and fauna with whom we share our planet.

 

May they prosper.

May every drop of water prosper.

May the divine Gods prosper.

 

सर्वं शान्तिः,

शान्तिरेव शान्तिः,

सा मे शान्तिरेधि।।

 

May everybody prosper.

 

May I also be blessed with prosperity.

 

ओम् शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः।।

 

Om prosperity. Prosperity.

Prosperity.

 

The thought and philosophy of our ancestors, was all-embracing and filled (फिल्ड) with great thought. They realized the true relationship between me and we. They knew that prosperity of me can only be through prosperity of we.

 

When our ancestors said we, they did not just mean their family or community or even just humans. It included the sky, water, plants, trees – everything.

 

It is also very important to know the order in which they are praying for peace and prosperity.

 

They pray for the sky, the earth, the water, the plants – these are things that sustain us. This is what we call the environment. If these prosper, then I prosper – this was their mantra. Even today, this is an extremely relevant thought.

 

With this spirit I once again congratulate you for taking part in this Summit.

 

Thank You.

Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of Shri Ram Jethmalani, the legal veteran and a former union minister.

“In the passing away of Shri Ram Jethmalani Ji, India has lost an exceptional lawyer and iconic public figure who made rich contributions both in the Court and Parliament. He was witty, courageous and never shied away from boldly expressing himself on any subject.

One of the best aspects of Shri Ram Jethmalani Ji was the ability to speak his mind. And, he did so without any fear. During the dark days of the Emergency, his fortitude and fight for public liberties will be remembered. Helping the needy was an integral part of his persona.

I consider myself fortunate to have got numerous opportunities to interact with Shri Ram Jethmalani Ji. In these sad moments, my condolences to his family, friends and many admirers. He may not be here but his pioneering work will live on! Om Shanti”, the Prime Minister said.

                Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

All the dignitaries present on stage; mothers, sisters and friends who have come here from far off places! I can see all the sisters standing far behind; probably they are not even able to see anything from that far. Yet you have come here to attend the event and shower your blessings; I am extremely grateful to you all. 

All of you are playing a major role in the development of the country, financially empowering our villages, the rural areas and your family. I salute all the sisters who are involved in building a New India empowering the country through Self-Help Groups and especially congratulate sister Pankaja.

Today an important building related to the development of Aurangabad has been inaugurated a short while back. The signature building of Aurangabad Industrial City is now ready for service. This will be an important building in the new Aurangabad city. This building will handle many facilities of the entire industrial city.

Aurangabad is becoming a new smart city; it is also going to be a major hub of industrial activities of the country. It is also an important part of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. Many big companies have started working here. In the near future, more companies will come here. These companies are going to provide new employment opportunities to lakhs of youngsters here.

Aurangabad is witnessing another huge accomplishment today. This achievement is yours i.e. crores of sisters of the country.

The resolution that we had taken to provide 8 crore free gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme has been accomplished in the presence of these crores of sisters on this platform today. We have not only been successful, but have achieved the target 7 months ahead of schedule.

Out of these 8 crore connections, about 44 lakh have been provided to Maharashtra alone. I congratulate all of you, and every sister of the country who has got rid of smoke, for this great achievement. I also salute those friends throughout the country who have worked hard and have helped in making this scheme a success.

In order to help our poor sisters getting suffocated in smoke, a target was set to first five crore gas connections for free. In March last year, this target was expanded to eight crore. Whenever I met you during the elections, I have always talked about achieving this goal. I am satisfied that this work was completed within 100 days of formation of the government.

This work was not limited to just giving connections. For this, more elaborate arrangements were made, and a holistic work was done. A much larger infrastructure was required for it, which was constructed in a very short time. Most of the 10 thousand new LPG Distributers for this purpose were appointed in the villages. Moreover, new LPG bottling plants were set up throughout the country so that there is no shortage of gas cylinders. The government expanded the gas pipeline network besides increasing the terminal capacity around the ports.

We are trying to ensure that there is no single family in the country that doesn't have an LPG connection. Besides, a 5 kg cylinder is also being promoted to make this scheme more convenient. In many areas of the country, the work of delivering gas through pipes is also going on at a faster pace.

Brothers and sisters, 

Now we have started with a big mission, which is also directly related to all of you, i.e. crores of sisters of the country. I am well aware of the difficulty all of the sisters have to face for water. Jal Jivan mission has been started only to get rid every sister in the country of this problem. Under this mission, the whole country is committed to conserve water so that water can be delivered from door to door. It has been decided that in the coming 5 years, about Rs. 3.5 lakh crores will be spent on this water campaign.

You might have heard that socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia ji had delivered a speech in Parliament in the 60-70s. He had said that the women of India had two major problems. We should solve it immediately. These are the things said by Lohiaji during the 60-70 periods. He said that there were two major problems faced by women of India, one was sanitation and the other was water. That is, there is no toilet for women, and there is no water available for women to run their homes. If these two problems are solved then the women of this country will become the powerhouse to solve the problems of the country. Lohia ji is gone; the governments changed; leaders changed, it is us who have decided that every house should have toilets and every house will also have water.

This region of Marathawada is going to be its biggest beneficiary anyway and all of you are also making commendable efforts along with the government of Devendra ji. Now Devendra ji has described in detail about his dream of bringing water to this area, in front of you. The first water grid being built in Marathawada is a commendable effort. After this grid is ready, the availability of water in this area will increase. This will help in providing drinking water to every village, and irrigation water to every field.

The Central and the state governments are taking several steps such as providing irrigation facilities to farmers. Many such efforts like Direct Benefit Transfer to the bank account of every farmer family, pension facility to farmers after the age of 60 years, vaccination campaign to keep livestock healthy are being made.

Brothers and sisters, 

Your contribution is very crucial in improving the economic condition of the village. Self-Help Groups, the work you are doing in the form of women's savings components, is not only empowering you financially but is also improving the family conditions. When the family is financially empowered, the strength of the country increases automatically.

Ladies, in view of your role in the development of the country, special efforts have been made in the last five years to further expand this movement. New entrepreneurship opportunities are being created for women through Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rural Livelihoods Mission. In the new India, we are moving ahead of the welfare of women and thinking of national welfare under the leadership of women.

That is why important announcements for Self-Help Groups have been made in this year's budget. The subsidy on interest for women Self-Help Groups is now being implemented across the country. Similarly, the members of the group who have Jan-Dhan bank accounts will receive an additional benefit of an overdraft of up to Rs 5000. Now you will not have to take more money from any money lender. This means that even if there is not single money deposited in your account, even then you can withdraw 5 thousand rupees from it for your need. This is a kind of easy loan, whose facility will be available on Jan-Dhan account.

Similarly, under the Mudra scheme, one woman member of every Self-Help Group will get a loan of up to Rs 1 lakh. This will help you to start or grow your business.

Friends, 

Mudra Yojana is playing an important role in turning the sisters into entrepreneurs. So far, around 20 crore loans have been distributed across the country under the scheme. Of these, about 14 crore loans have been given to our sisters and daughters. In Maharashtra too, out of 1.5 crore beneficiaries of Mudra Yojana, 1.25 crore beneficiaries are our mothers and sisters. We have to intensify and strengthen this change coming in the field of women entrepreneurship. For this, all kinds of steps required to be taken at the government level will be taken.

As a Self-Help Group, you are not only a strong medium for economic empowerment, but also an important watchdog for social change. The government has taken several steps from saving the lives of daughters, to ensuring their education and creating a safe environment for them. Here the government of Devendra ji has done a commendable job in this direction. But government planning and legislation alone are not enough. We need to bring a comprehensive change in the mindset of the society towards daughters. The role of AAP sisters and daughters is also important for the same.

Recently you have seen that a strict law has been enacted to get Muslim sisters out of the evil of triple talaq. Now you have to spread awareness about this law within the society.

When we achieve the goal ahead of time, the courage to accomplish the bigger resolutions automatically enhances. When work is done honestly and with a good intent, then there is no lack of effort in it. You must be familiar with what had happened to Chandrayaan.

Our scientists had tried to achieve a major goal, but there was an obstacle. Scientists had been working hard for this mission for a long time.

I was with them last night and this morning. They were sentimental, but at the same time, they were very confident of working at a faster pace than on; by taking lessons from what had happened and moving forward. With this kind of a commitment only the country can be taken forward and the lives of the people can be made easier.

Due to the commitment of such passionate people in different parts of the country, several efforts such as providing electricity to every village in the country and gas connections to 8 crore families have been completed ahead of time. Now very soon the whole country is moving towards declaring itself Open Defecation Free.

I am confident that in 2022, when we will be celebrating 75 years of independence, the resolutions we have taken will surely be fulfilled.

Brothers and sisters, 

By 2022, we are moving fast towards the goal of providing a pucca house to every poor. So far, about 1crore 80 lakh houses have been built in the villages and cities of the country. The beneficiaries have moved to live therein. Many people ask us that the scheme for providing houses to the poor was run even before, and the funds were also available earlier, but what did you do differently?

First of all, I want to say that we used to believe that we have to build homes, not houses; we should build your dream home and not just a house with four walls. We wanted to build houses where all facilities are also available. That is, apart from the ways of erecting four walls in the name of the house, we needed to do something better. Our intention was to provide maximum facilities in the shortest possible time without any cost.

Friends, 

Our government did not adopt a fixed formula for the houses that should be built, It was not that the houses would have to be built in the same way as on papers. No, but on the contrary, we also took into account the needs and desires of the local people while constructing the houses and making plans to build houses keeping those things in mind. In order to ensure all the basic amenities in the house, we combined various government schemes together so that electricity, gas connections, toilets and all such facilities would also be present in those houses simultaneously.

We have heard the needs of you all so that these houses could be made according to the expectations of the people. After this, not only the area of ​​the house was increased but the funds for construction was also raised. We also included local artisans and labourers in this process. Many women had worked. You will also hear words like 'Rani Mistri' if you go to Jharkhand today. We also focused on delivery of homes in minimum time, without any extra cost. For this, technology was adopted as an important part of the same.

Brothers and sisters, 

We have also tried to strengthen the dreams of those who wish to buy their own house. To further promote the affordable houses, the government made an additional exemption in income tax on the interest of Rs 1.5 lakh on home loans so that the middle class family can buy a home.

Our emphasis was also on transparency. Photographs of different stages of house construction were uploaded online. Correct information was made available to the administration in a transparent manner. Moreover, there was a lack of transparency in the field of real estate. As a result, people buying homes were facing serious problems. The government has worked to instill confidence in the home buyers by enacting the RERA law. Today the RERA law has been notified in most states. Tribunal is also working. Lakhs of new flats are being constructed under this project.

Overall, we have worked with a holistic approach for the house. If we had come up with different isolated plans, it would have been difficult to achieve a huge success. Large-scale solutions are possible only when all departments work together and all decisions are made considering a major goal and when all the ministries and all the schemes work together on one track. This is the hallmark of the functioning of our government - think in totality, not in a piecemeal manner, and work together by taking along everyone.

All of you have contributed immensely to the mass movements that have taken place in the last 5 years, from cleanliness to bank to transactions, as well as behavioral changes in the society. That is why for the next 5 years too, I have immense faith in you regarding the fulfillment of the resolutions that have been taken. I thank you with the expectation that these beliefs will be strengthened further.

Thank you and so many mothers and sisters have come on the day of the festival to bless us in such large numbers; it is an empowering feeling in itself. Saluting this power of mother, I end my speech. Say along with me loudly with both hands up-

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Thanks a lot!

                My dear brothers and sisters,

Greetings to the people of Mumbai!

Ganapati Bappa Moreya!

Ganapati Bappa Moreya!

 

I got the opportunity to seek the blessings of the Ganpati Bappa at the Lokmanya Seva Sangh before coming here. This is the Centenary Year of the Ganeshotsav of the Lokmanya Seva Sangh. The tradition that was spread by Lokmanya Tilak to strengthen the society is now popular in the country and around the world.

 

Our new Governor, Shri Koshyari ji, is also present here. Probably very few people are aware of the fact that he had been a popular Chief Minister of Uttarakhand once. More importantly, I am feeling proud to mention that while I used to work for the organization of Bharatiya Janta Party, and was assigned work in Uttarakhand, I used to work under his guidance. 

Friends,

The simplicity and affection of the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra always overwhelms me. During the election campaign, I had been to several cities of Maharashtra and had interacted with you. The rally held at night in Mumbai was in news for several days. I am grateful to you all for this affection and blessings. 

The fact that you have come here to attend this event in such large numbers taking time out in this inclement weather depicts your mood and is an indicator of your dreams. 

Friends,

I was constantly being updated of the condition in Mumbai when I was in Russia. I returned yesterday morning only and left for Bengaluru that evening. I was with my scientist friends from ISRO the entire night there. I am extremely influenced by their courage. We can all learn from our ISRO scientists, our engineers how they have toiled day and night to achieve their goal with patience, even in the adverse circumstances. 

 

Brothers and sisters, 

There is a wealth of knowledge in our scriptures. Bhartrihari said-

प्रारभ्यते न खलु विघ्नभयेन नीचैः ,

प्रारभ्य विघ्नविहिता विरमन्ति मध्याः ।

विघ्नै: पुनः पुनरपि प्रतिहन्यमानाः ,

प्रारभ्य च उत्तमजनाः न परित्यजन्ति ।।

That is, there are three types of people who try to achieve any goal. At the lowest rung are those people who never start work for fear of obstacles; then, there are some people at the middle level who start work, but run away as soon as the first obstacle comes. Besides these two types, there are people who reach the highest level, who despite several obstacles and challenges try relentlessly and do not stop until they achieve their goals.

Friends, ISRO and the people who work with it, are the third type of people. Until the goal is reached, they do not stop, nor do they get tired or just sit. Now we have seen an obstacle in the mission Chandrayaan today, but ISRO scientists will not stop till they accomplish their mission. The dream of reaching the moon will be fulfilled.

 

And friends, we also have to remember that the orbiter sent with Chandrayaan is still there, orbiting the moon, which is also a historical achievement. I have seen and heard a lot about the spirit of the people of Mumbai. Today, I saw the spirit of the people of ISRO and I felt it necessary to share those things with you.

Brothers and sisters, 

In an environment wherein ceaseless efforts for accomplishing the resolutions are being made with the spirit of Ganeshotsav, thousands of crores of rupees worth schemes are being launched in Maharashtra today.

After Mumbai I also plan to go to Aurangabad. Many projects will also be launched there. I convey my best wishes to the people living in Mumbai and its suburban areas. The work of more than 20 thousand crore rupees is starting here today. Be it a new metro line, a metro building, an expansion of facilities at the metro station, a project to connect the Bandra-Kurla complex with the Eastern Express highway; all these projects will not only give a new dimension to Mumbai's infrastructure but will also help in making the lives of the people here easier.

The project connecting Bandra-Kurla with the express highway will bring a huge relief to lakhs of professionals.

BKC is a huge center of business activity. It will be easier to come here now in less time and now one can reach Mumbai in minutes. Everyone demands – ‘Mumbai in minutes’. I congratulate all of you, every Mumbaikar, for all these projects.

Friends, 

Mumbai is the city whose dynamism has also given pace to the country. The hardworking people here, the professionals here, the mothers, sisters, youth here, and all of you love this city and proudly say ' I am a Mumbaikar'. We have tried very sincerely to improve the infrastructure of Amchi Mumbai in the last five years. Here, I know very well how hard the Fadnavis government has worked for each project of Mumbai and Maharashtra. Today all these efforts have the effect that a gradual change can be seen in Mumbai. And I see the most positive side in it that work is being done right now according to the needs of the present as well as the future keeping in mind the needs of the coming decades.

Brothers and sisters, 

Today as the country is moving towards the goal of 5 trillion dollar economy, we also have to modify our cities according to the world of the 21st century. Be it mobility, connectivity, productivity, sustainability or safety, we have to prepare a better system in every respect. With this thinking, our government is going to spend 100 lakh crore rupees on modern infrastructure in the next five years. Apart from Mumbai, this amount is going to benefit all the cities of Maharashtra as well.

 

Friends, 

We are emphasizing on an integrated system to improve mobility and transport in cities across the country. Every such medium like rail, road and metro is being connected to each other. Today, a vision document has been released here to prepare better public transport system in Mumbai metropolitan region. There are different modes of travel, such as Mumbai local, bus system and metro. The details of how to use them properly are given in this. In particular, a master plan has been built for Mumbai Metro.

Brothers and sisters, 

For the past five years, I have been getting a chance to continuously connect with the expansion work of Mumbai Metro. The metro network is being expanded here at a cost of about Rs 1.5 lakh crore. At present, Mumbai has a metro network of only 11 km. But by 1920, 1923 and 1924, it will increase to more than 325 kilometers. The biggest advantage of this will be that today, as many people travel daily by local trains in Mumbai; the metro will be able to cater to almost the same number of people. Besides modernizing the local train, this combination of metro expansion will cater to the current needs of Mumbai and also prepare it for the coming years.

Friends, 

We are not only laying the metro lines but also ensuring that the coaches of the metro that will run on these lines are also built in India. I have seen the Mock-up coach a short while ago. These modern metro coaches built under Make in India are going to make Mumbai Metro safe, convenient and economical.

Brothers and sisters, 

Infrastructure is equally related to employment as it is related to the economy and ease of living. Investing in Infrastructure means to create new employment opportunities. If I consider only the Metro related work that has started in Mumbai; that alone will provide employment opportunities to 10 thousand engineers and 40 thousand skilled and unskilled people.

Brothers and sisters, 

The infrastructure work that is being done in the villages and the cities, generates employment at the local level, and creates business opportunities for small traders; but people do not talk much about it. Perhaps one of the reasons for this is that the speed and scale at which the work is being done today has never happened before. Therefore, it is natural for the people to lose their attention towards it. Now that the situation is changing, this topic will also start becoming a part of the discussion. Just imagine! Could anyone have ever imagined before that the work of Navi-Mumbai Airport, which had been stuck for years, or the work of Mumbai Trans Harbor Link, or the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train would start at such a large scale or would progress at such a fast pace? All these projects are giving new opportunities of employment to the people in and around Mumbai.

Brothers and sisters, 

When I talk of speed and scale, I have so many examples that if I start counting them, it will be evening. Today, massive projects of metro have started here, so I want to give you an example related to that.

Friends, 

The first metro in our country had started 30-35 years ago. After this, the metro could run in only a few big cities by 2014. Today, metro in 27 cities in the country has either started or is going to start in the near future. Today, 675 km line is operational across the country, out of which 400 km of metro service has started in the last five years. Just imagine! More than half of the metro lines have been connected just in the last five years. And more than 850 kilometers of metro line is currently under construction.

Brothers and sisters, 

Nearly 600 kilometers of new metro lines have been approved in the last five years. Be it Mumbai, Pune or Nagpur, the work on Metro started during this period and I would praise Fadnavis ji for the fast pace of work on these projects.

Brothers and sisters, 

Connecting the country with the modern infrastructure of the 21st century is extremely necessary to take the country forward at a faster pace. Today work is going on to develop the country's infrastructure in a holistic way. Not in isolation, but we are moving forward with the vision of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat'. From ‘One Nation One Power Grid’ to ‘One Nation One Mobility Card’; from ‘One Nation One Tax’ to ‘One Nation One Network of Optical Fiber’, our government is building modern infrastructure across the country.

Brothers and sisters, 

We all have the responsibility to ensure that our children, our future generations, do not have to face the same problems that we have faced all these years. We must not bequeath troubles to our children. Improvement in the standard of living of every person improves the condition of the country. We have to fulfill the dreams of our present and the past as well as have to prepare for the future. If the country is ready for the future from today, only then your children will be able to live a happy life.

The decisions taken by our government after the formation of the new government with your blessings will strengthen the future of Indians and secure them.

Friends, 

Honouring the mandate given by the people of the country, several important decisions have been taken in the right direction. This government is completing 100 days and within these 100 days such works have been done, which are unprecedented as well as historic. Be it the launch of Jalajeevan Mission or the decision to bring every farmer in the country under the Kisan-Samman Nidhi, or the law to free our Muslim sisters and daughters from the crisis of triple talaq or the law related to the protection of children; Work is being done very fast in every field.

But besides these decisions and actions of the government and apart from serving you, I have taken another resolution. This resolution is to make more people aware of their responsibilities on more and more occasions. And that is: ‘One Indian - One Resolution’. Lokmanya Tilak Ji had said, 'Swaraj is my birth right'. 75 years of independence is about to come; we have a new mantra - 'Surajya is the duty of the countrymen'. I request you all to adopt this ‘One Indian-one resolution’. You must make at least one resolution and that resolution must be in the interest of the country and never step back from fulfilling the resolution. You can make any resolution that you want in the interest of Mumbai and in the interest of Maharashtra.


	the way, I can give you one suggestion right now, would you accept? The voice is rather inaudible. Will you agree? Will you agree? Will you accomplish it? Will you do it alone and also together with everyone?


Friends, 

During Bappa’s immersion, a lot of plastic and other waste goes into our seas. This time we have to try and ensure that such items which increase water pollution will not be thrown in the water. Moreover, after immersion, we will engage in making sweet river water and other water sources besides the seas plastic free at personal level. Will you do this? I want to hear from the back, will you? Sure? I am sure that this enthusiasm of yours will play a huge role in making the entire country free of plastic.

Once again, many best wishes and many congratulations to all of you for all the development projects. I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for coming here taking time out from your busy schedules and arrangements during the festival.

Jai Mumbai, Jai Maharashtra.

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Thanks a lot.

                The PM addressed a state-level Mahila Saksham Melava or Empowered Women’s Meet of Self Help Groups, organized by Maharashtra State Rural Livelihood Mission (UMED), in Aurangabad today.

Addressing the gathering, the PM commended the empowered women present for their contribution towards empowering themselves and their communities through Self Help Groups.

The PM observed that Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC) will become an important part of the Aurangabad town and an important industrial centre of the country in the near future. Aurangabad is an important segment of Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor as well, the PM added. The firms investing in AURIC will create a lot of jobs as well, said the PM.

Marking the ahead-of-date achievement of 8 crore LPG connections under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, the PM distributed LPG connections to five beneficiaries. Noting that this has been achieved seven months ahead of the target date, the PM observed that in Maharashtra alone, 44 lakh Ujjwala connections have been given. Saluting the colleagues who made this possible, the PM said that we were able to achieve it due to our concern for the health of women suffering from the smoke emanated by chullahs.



The PM added that not only were connections given, but a holistic infrastructure comprising 10,000 new LPG distributors, mostly in rural India, have been appointed. “New bottling plants have been built. Terminal capacity near ports has been increased and pipeline network has been widened. 5-kg cylinders are being promoted. Piped gas is also being delivered. We want to ensure that not a single household remains without LPG connection.”



The PM said that Jal Jeevan Mission has been launched in order to free women from the trouble of having to toil hard to fetch water. “Jal Jeevan Mission involves saving water and delivering water at one’s doorstep. The Government will spend 3.5 lakh crore rupees for this, in the next five years”.

Recalling Shri Ram Manohar Lohia’s statement that toilet and water are the two biggest problems faced by Indian women, the PM said that if these two issues are resolved, women can then lead the country. “Marathwada region is going to benefit in a big way from Jal Jeevan Mission. The first water grid in the country will be made in Marathwada; this will increase water availability in the region”.

Pointing out the importance of public participation in government schemes, the PM said that the government is providing pension to every farmer after attainment of 60 years of age. Similar efforts are being made for vaccination of animals as well, said the PM. 

Aajeevika – National Rural Livelihoods Mission creates earning opportunities for women, observed the PM. He added that the Union Budget 2019 has made special provisions to provide interest subsidy to SHGs; Jan Dhan account holders belonging to SHGs will also get an overdraft facility of 5000 rupees, thereby obviating the need for them to approach private moneylenders, the PM added.

Speaking about other initiatives for the empowerment of women’s Self Help Groups, the PM said: “Under MUDRA scheme, one woman in every SHG will get a loan of 1 lakh rupees; this will help them start new ventures and grow their business. Loans worth 20 crore rupees have been distributed till now, out of which 14 crore rupees were given to women. Maharashtra has 1.5 crore MUDRA beneficiaries, 1.25 crore out of which are women”. 

The PM highlighted the role of women in ushering positive social change. “You are an important driver of social change. Many steps have been taken for saving girl child, educating and protecting her. We need to make changes in societal outlook, the role of women is important in this. Muslim women are being saved from the bad practice of teen talaaq. You have to create awareness about this.” 

On India’s Chandrayaan 2 Mission, the PM said: “Our scientists had decided to achieve a big milestone. I was among them today; they were emotional but they have an indomitable spirit as well. They wish to go ahead on learning from mistakes.” 

The PM stated that India will soon declare itself as Open Defecation Free. 

Stating that the Government wants to provide homes not just houses, the PM added: “We want to give you a home of your dreams, not a structure with four walls. We want to give many facilities in it. We worked without any fixed formula and we made homes as per local requirements. We have tried to give all the basic facilities, by integrating the benefits provided under various schemes. 1 crore, 80 lakh homes have already been built. I am confident that when we observe Independence Day in 2022, we will try to give a pucca home to everyone.”

Speaking further on provision of homes, the PM said: “Interest exemption on home loans up to 1.5 lakh rupees has been provided, so that the middle class can have their homes. Photos of houses in various stages of construction have been put on the website, bringing in transparency and removing fund leakages. We brought in RERA Act, to bring in transparency in the real estate sector; the Act has now been notified in many states, lakhs of flats are being made under this”. 

Stating that the Government does not want to work in silos but wants to bring all schemes together for development, the PM expressed hope that the people will contribute to the success of Government schemes.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated and laid foundation stone for various Mumbai Metro projects, in line with the vision of Mumbai in Minutes. The projects will provide a boost to the metro infrastructure of the city and will contribute to a safer, faster and better commute for every Mumbaikar.

Appreciating the spirit of Mumbaikars, the PM said that Ganesh Utsav started by LokmanyaTilak has become popular in India and abroad too.

Speaking on the undying resolve of ISRO and its team of scientists, the PM said: “There are three types of people who strive to attain goals: those who do not even start due to fear of failure, those who start but run away on facing challenges and those who strive continuously despite big challenges. ISRO and those associated with it belong to the third category; they do not stop or get tired or pause before the mission is attained. Though we have faced a challenge in Mission Chandrayaan 2, ISRO’s scientists will not stop until the goal is realized. The goal of conquering the moon will definitely be achieved. It is a historic achievement that the Orbiter has been placed successfully in the lunar orbit.”



The PM said that projects worth 20,000 crore rupees have been initiated in Mumbai today, while 1.5 lakh crore rupees have already been invested in Mumbai Metro. He said that new metro lines, Metro Bhavan and new facilities at metro stations will give a new dimension to Mumbai and make life easier for Mumbaikars. “The connection between Bandra and expressway will make life easier for professionals. With these projects, Mumbai can be reached in minutes”. He complimented the state government for the changes being brought about in the field of infrastructure.

As India proceeds towards the goal of becoming a 5 trillion dollar economy, our cities too should become cities of the 21st century. In line with this goal, the Government is spending 100 lakh rupees in next five yearson building modern infrastructure, which will benefit Mumbai and many other cities. The PM highlighted the importance of future-ready infrastructure and noted that connectivity, productivity, sustainability and safety need to be considered while developing cities.

To make transport easier, the Government is striving to build integrated transport systems. A vision document has been released to provide better infrastructure for Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The document explains how to make best use of various modes of transport, such as Mumbai local, bus system. A master plan for Mumbai metro has been made.

Informing citizens about the expansion plan for Mumbai Metro, the PM said: “From 11 km today, the metro network of the city will increase to 325 km by 2023-’24. The capacity of the metro will become as much as that of the volume of people carried by Mumbai local today. The coaches which run on the metro lines will also be manufactured in India.”

The PM stated that 10,000 engineers and 40,000 skilled and unskilled workers will get job opportunities due to the metro projects. Citing the examples of Navi Mumbai airport, Mumbai Trans Harbour terminal and bullet train project, the PM said that the scale and speed with which projects are being executed today is unprecedented.



Reflecting on the fast expansion of the metro system in India, the PM said that metro was present in only a few cities until recently, while today a metro is present or is being launched in the near future in 27 cities. “675 km of metro lines are operational today, out of which around 400 km became functional in the last five years; work is in progress on 850 km, while approval has been given for work on 600 km of metro lines.”

The PM said that efforts are being made to develop India’s infrastructure in a holistic way, in order to fast-track development. 

The PM said that historic decisions have been taken by the government in the first 100 days. CitingJal Jeevan Mission, Pradhan MantriKisanSammanNidhiYojana, abolition of triple talaq and Act for child safety, the PM said that the government has taken decisive and transformative steps.

Speaking of the importance of being aware of one’s responsibilities, the PM said that Surajya is the duty of every Indian. The PM exhorted everyone to make a resolve for the sake of the country and to work hard in fulfilling it.He suggested to avoid pollution of water bodies during immersion of Bappa(Ganesh idol), noting that a lot of plastic and waste goes into sea during the festival. He also exhorted people to make the Mithi River and other water bodies plastic-free, thereby setting an example to the rest of India, in the shared quest to make India free of plastic.

Projects in Brief

The PM laid foundation stone for three metro lines, which will together add more than 42 km to the metro network of the city. The three corridors are 9.2 km long Gaimukh to ShivajiChowk (Mira Road) Metro-10 corridor, 12.7 km long Wadala to ChhatrapatiShivajiMaharaj Terminus Metro-11 corridor and 20.7 km long Kalyan to Taloja Metro-12 corridor.

                Bharat Mata Ki Jai! 

Bharat Mata Ki Jai! 

Bharat Mata Ki Jai!

You are the people who live for Maa Bharti and for her victory. You are the people who fight for Maa Bharti's victory. You are the ones who have passion for Maa Bharti. You spend your entire life and dreams so that Maa Bharti’s head is held high.

Friends, 

I could understand your state of mind last night. Your eyes said a lot, I was able to read the sorrow on your face and hence I did not stay amongst you for long. You have not slept for several nights, yet I thought of calling you again and talking to you in the morning. Everyone associated with this mission was in a different state of mind. There were many unanswered questions. You moved forward with a great success. But suddenly nothing was visible. I too have lived that moment with you. When the communication was lost, you were all shaken. I was watching everything. A natural question came to the mind - Why did that happen? How did that happen? And the mind of a scientist works similarly. He starts everything with a 'why'. There were a lot of expectations. I realized that even after that you had hopes because your hard work was behind everything and you have developed it every moment taking care of all the nuances. 

Friends, 

Today, even though there have been some obstacles and challenges, but this has not weakened our spirits rather strengthened it. Today, even though one last hurdle has appeared on our path in the end, it has not deterred us from the path of our destination. Today even though we could not go through our plan of touching the surface of the moon, and if a poet has to write today's event, the literature has to be written, the writer would describe the moon in a romantic way. But the language of science is different. The description had assimilated even in the nature of Chandrayaan. And so the Chandrayaan raced to embrace the moon. The poet would say the same. Today our will to touch the moon and our determination to reach the moon has been further strengthened.

Sisters and brothers of India, my scientist friends, for the last few hours the entire nation was awake. We were awake in solidarity with our scientists, who had embarked on one of the most ambitious missions of our space program.

We came very close but we will need to cover more ground in the times to come. Every Indian is filled with a spirit of pride as well as confidence. We are proud of our space program and scientists, their hard work and determination has ensured a better life not only for our citizens but also for other nations.

It is the outcome of their innovative zeal that several people have got access to a better quality of life including better Health Care and education facilities. India is certain that there will be many more opportunities to be proud and rejoice, thanks.

At the same time, we are full of confidence that when it comes to our space program the best is yet to come. 

There are new frontiers to discover and new places to go. We will rise to the occasion and scale newer heights of success. 

To our scientists I want to say India is with you. You are exceptional professionals who have made an incredible contribution to national progress.

You have given your best always and will give us several more opportunities to smile. True to your nature you ventured into a place where no one had ever ventured before.

You are the people who leave your impression on a rock. 

You came as close as you could. Stay steady and look ahead. I also salute the families of our space scientists. Their silent but valuable support remains a major asset.

Sisters and brothers of India resilience and tenacity are Central to India’s ethos. In our glorious history of thousands of years we have faced moments that may have slowed us but they have never crushed our spirit. We have bounced back again and gone to do spectacular things. This is the reason our civilization stands tall.

My dear friends as important as the final result, is the journey and the effort. I can proudly say that the effort was worth it and so was the journey. Our team worked hard, traveled far and those teachings will always remain with us. We will look back at the journey and effort with great satisfaction. The learning from today will make us stronger and better. There will be a new dawn and a brighter tomorrow very soon.

Friends, it has also been our tradition and culture to continuously move towards the goals without being disappointed by the results. Our thousands of years old history is full of such examples. Despite the initial disruptions, we have achieved historical results.

ISRO itself is a living example of the culture of never giving up. If we had stopped by our initial problems and challenges, today ISRO would not have become one of the world's leading space agencies.

Friends, 

Getting desired result is one thing. But me and the entire nation is proud of the efforts of all the scientists and engineers. I had told you at night and I am reiterating it again that I am with you, the nation is with you.

Friends, 

Every problem, every struggle, or every challenge teaches us something new. These inspire for some new inventions and new technology. And this determines our success ahead. I anyway believe that the greatest teacher of knowledge is science. There is no failure in science; there are only experiments and efforts. Every experiment and every effort sows new seeds of knowledge. It lays the foundation for new possibilities and makes us realize our immense potential.

Friends, 

The last lap of Chandrayaan's journey may not have been as per our expectation, but we also have to remember that Chandrayaan's journey has been a spectacular one; it has been lively. The country has rejoiced several times during this entire mission. Our nation is feeling immense pride at this moment as the Orbiter is whirring around the moon. I myself have been seeking information related to the status of Chandrayaan every time whether I was in the country or abroad during this entire mission. 

Friends, 

India is one of the important space powers in the world. So all of you who have worked in ISRO and we're behind this programme have put your hard work and contribution to it. It is you who have hoisted the flag of India on Mars in your very first attempt. Earlier, no such achievement was made in the world. Our Chandrayaan gave the world important information about aspects like water on the moon. It was with your efforts that we created a new record by launching more than a hundred satellites simultaneously. When ISRO has encyclopedia of successes, your flight cannot be out of trajectory just because of one or two interruptions. 

Friends, 

Our culture and our thinking are full of what we say and what we believe - 'Vayam Amrutasya putra'. We are children of nectar; or nectar is associated with us. There is neither any hindrance nor any disappointment for the children of nectar. We do not have to turn back and be disappointed. We have to take lessons, learn, keep moving forward and never stop until the goal is achieved. We will certainly succeed; we will be successful in our next mission as well as in every effort thereafter.

No momentary obstacle can stop us from fulfilling India's dreams and aspirations in the 21st century. I wish you all the best for every mission in the future. And as I said earlier, science is never satisfied with results. The inherent quality of science is effort, effort and effort. Even from the result, one seeks opportunities for a new endeavour. One does not stop with the result. Nor does one bow down to the result and these are inherent in your values. And that's why the country is proud of you. I too believe in you; your dreams are higher than mine; your resolutions are deeper than mine. Your potential to kiss the accomplishments is greater than mine and that is why I trust your confidence completely. Actually I have not come here to preach. I have come here in the morning to seek inspiration from you. You are a sea of ​​inspiration, a living form of inspiration. And so this is a moment of inspiration for me; where the scientific mind converts despair into hope; where dreams sprout into scientific accomplishment, and so I congratulate this team of friends dedicated to such a powerful, zealous and determined accomplishment.

Thanks a lot!

Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai!

Thanks a lot!

“You are those people who work for Mother India’s victory and struggle for it and have a grit and determination to make her proud. “

“We might have faced a small setback in our journey but this would not let down our zeal and enthusiasm to achieve our goals”

Our resolve strengthens now.

“The whole nation was awake last night in solidarity with our scientist sisters and brothers. We came very close to the surface of the moon and that effort is highly laudable. “

“We are proud of our space programme and scientists, their hard work and determination has ensured a better life not only for our citizens but also other nations. It is their outcome of their innovative zeal that several people got better quality of life including better health care and education.”

“India knows that there would be many more proud moments to rejoice.”

“When it comes to space programme the best is yet to come.”

“There are new frontiers to discover and new places to go. We will rise to the occasion and scale newer heights of success. “

“To our scientists I want to say, India is with you. True to your nature, you ventured into a place where no one had never gone before.”

 “You have gone as close as you could. I can proudly say the effort was worth it and so was the journey

Our team worked hard and travelled far, and those teachings will always remain with us”

“The learning from today will get us a stronger and better tomorrow”

“I thank the families of our space scientists. Their silent but valuable support remains a major strength in our effort.”

“Sisters and brothers, resilience and tenacity are centre to India’s ethos. In our glorious history we may have faced moments that could have crushed us but we never gave up. This is the reason our civilization stands tall.”

In our glorious history we may have faced moments that could have crushed us but we never gave up. This is the reason our civilization stands tall.”

 “We have made historical achievements. I know that ISRO also does not failures to let it down”

“There will be a new dawn and a better tomorrow. Without worrying about results we go ahead and that is our history.”

I congratulate you all and wish you all the best in your endeavours.

                Excellency President Putin, 
President Battulga, 
Prime Minister Abe, 
Prime Minister Mahathir, 
 
Friends, 
Namaskar 
Dobry Den! 
 
It is a pleasant experience to have a dialgoue with you in the quiet and light environment of Vladivostok. The morning light spreads from here and makes the whole world energized. I am confident our brainstorming today will give a new energy and a new momentum not only to the Far East but also to the efforts being made for the welfare of the entire human race. I am grateful to my friend President Putin for making me a part of this important occasion. The President had extended me this invitation before the General Election of India. 130 crore Indians expressed their confidence in me and your invitation sealed that trust with a stamp. Two years ago, President Putin invited me to the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. From the Frontier of Europe to the Gateway to the Pacific, in a way I have completed the whole trans-Siberian journey. Vladivostok is a confluence of Eurasia and the Pacific. This presents opportunities for the Arctic and the Northern Sea routes. About three quarters of Russia's land is Asia. The Far East reinforces the Asian identity of this great country. The region is approximately twice the size of India, with a population of only 6 million, but this region is rich in natural resources like minerals and oil and gas. People here have overcome the challenges of nature with their tireless hard work, courage and innovation. Not only this, there is no such area of Art, Science, Literature, Sports, Industry and adventure activity in which the people of Far East, the residents of Vladivostok have not achieved success. At the same time they have created many opportunities for Russia and its friends. By transforming Frozen Land into a flower bed the base for a golden future has been prepared. Yesterday, along with President Putin, I visited the 'Street of the Far East' exhibition. The diversity, the talent of the people and the development of technology here has greatly impressed me. I feel there are immense possibilities of progress and cooperation. 
 
Friends, 
 
The relationship between India and Far East is not of today, it is very old. India was the first country to open its consulate in Vladivostok. At that time and even earlier also there was a lot of trust between India and Russia. Even during Soviet Russia when there were restrictions on other foreigners visiting there, Vladivostok was open to Indian citizens. A lot of defense and development equipment used to reach India through Vladivostok and today this partnership tree is deepening its roots. It is becoming the pillar of prosperity for the people of both the countries. India has made significant investments here in the energy sector and other natural resources like diamonds. Sakhalin's oil fields are a classic example of the success of Indian investment. 
 
Friends, 
 
President Putin's affinity to the Far East and his vision has brought unprecedented opportunities not only for the region but also for its partners like India. He has declared the development of Russian Far East as the National Priority for 21st Century. His holistic approach here is a motivating effort to make every aspect of life better, be it economy or education, health or sports, culture or communication, trade or tradition. On the one hand, he has opened avenues for investment and on the other, equal attention and importance has also been given to social sectors. I myself have been deeply impressed by his vision and share this as well. India wants to walk step by step with Russia in this visionary journey. On the basis of my experience, I can say that President Putin's vision for rapid, balanced and inclusive development of the Far East and Vladivostok will surely succeed because it is realistic and it is backed by its valuable resources and the immense talent of people here. His vision reflects respect and love for this region and for the people here. In India too, we are engaged in building a new India with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas. (Together with development for all with trust of all). We are trying to fulfil our resolve of making India a $ 5 trillion economy by 2024. Partnership of rapidly growing India and its talent with this region is a historic ‘one plus one equals to eleven’opportunity. 
 
Friends, 
 
With this motivation, unprecedented preparations were made for our participation in the Eastern Economic Forum. Many Ministers, Chief Ministers of four states and about 150 business leaders came here. They met President's Special Envoy for Far East, its all the 11 governors and their business leaders. Russian ministers and business leaders from Far East also visited India. I am happy to say that these efforts are bringing very good results. From energy to health, education to skill development, mining to timber, there have been about 50 business agreements in many areas. They are expected to invest several billion dollars. 
 
Friends, 
 
India will provide a $ 1 billion line of credit to further contribute to the development of the Far East. This is the first time that we are giving a line of credit to a particular region of a country. My Government's Act East Policy has actively engaged with the East Asia. Today's announcement will prove to be the take-off point of the Act Far East policy and it is my firm belief that this step adds a new dimension to our economic diplomacy. We will be active participants in the development of the regions of our friendly countries according to their priorities. 
 
Friends, 
 
Ancient Indian civilization values have taught us that we must take from nature only that much what we need. We believe in the promotion of natural resources. For centuries this very association with nature has been an integral part of our existence and development. 
 
Friends, 
 
The leaders of the countries where the Indian diaspora is present always praise the labor, honesty, discipline and loyalty of Indians whenever I meet them. Indian companies, businessmen have contributed to the development of so many sectors around the worldand helped in wealth creation. Indians and our companies have always respected the local sensibilities and the culture also. I am sure that the money, sweat, talent and professionalism of Indians will bring rapid development in the Far East. I invite all the 11 Governors of the Far East to visit India to take forward the excellent results that India has achieved in the Eastern Economic Forum. 
 
Friends, 
 
I and President Putin have set ambitious targets for the Indo-Russian cooperation. We have added new dimensions to our relationship and have diversified them. Bringing the relationship outside the domain of government domain has led to solid cooperation among the private industries. We have taken the relations out of the capital brought them to the States and regions. We have expanded and modeled cooperation in every field as per the framework of our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. Together we will cross the distances of the space and also bring out prosperity from the depths of the sea. 
 
Friends, 
 
We are about to start a new era of cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. When the ships will start sailing between Vladivostok and Chennai, and when Vladivostok will become India's springboard in North East Asia market, India-Russia partnership will further deepen and flourish. Then the Far East will become a confluence of the Eurasian Union on one side and the open, free and inclusive Indo-Pacific on the other. Our relations in this region will have a strong foundation of rule based order, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and abstaining from interfering in the internal affairs of a country. 
 
Friends, 
 
Famous philosopher and author Tolstoy was greatly influenced by the immense knowledge of the Vedas of India and he was immensely fond of this sentence. एकम सत विप्रःबहुधा वदन्ति।। In his words he expressed it like this - 
 
""All that exists is one. People call that one by different names.” 
 
This year the whole world is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Tolstoy and Gandhi Ji left an indelible influence on each other. Let us strengthen this shared inspiration of India and Russiaand become greater partners in each other's progress. Let’s work together for our shared vision and a stable and secure future of the world. This will be the beginning of a new chapter in our partnership. Whenever I have come to Russia, I have found love, friendship and respect for India here. Even today, I am going from here with the precious gift of these feelings and a resolve for a deeper cooperation. I would like to express my special thanks to my friend President Putin. Whenever we meet, we meet with very open hearts and dedicate a lot of time. Yesterday, in the midst of all his engagements, he spent many hours with me at different places and we stayed together till one o'clock in the night. It reflects the love that he has not only for me but towards India also. I see another cultural similarity here and in India. In my home state of Gujarat, instead of Bye-Bye, we do not say Bye-Bye, instead we say, Aavajo, which means - come back soon. Here it is said - Dasvidania. 
 
So I say to everyone - Aavajo, Dasvidania. 
 
Thank you very much! 
Spasibo Bolshoi!

                Your Excellency President Putin,
Friends,
Namaskar,
DobreVecher!

Where the dawn comes first in the whole world, where the victory over the nature of the unstoppable struggle of our Russian friends has become the inspiration for the whole world and where new stories of human development are being written in the 21st century. I am extremely happy to have come to such a great place-Vladivostok. And it has been made possible on the invitation of my dear friend President Putin. For this I thank from my heart my friend - President Putin.The invitation, which gave me the privilege of being the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Vladivostok. I am grateful to President Putin, my friend for this.

And it is a pleasant historical coincidence that President Putin and I have participated in the 20th Annual Summit between India and Russia. In the year 2001, when the Indo-Russian summit took place in Russia for the first time, my friend Putin was the President of Russia, and I was in the delegation of India with Atal Ji, the then Prime Minister and I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. During the political journey of President Putin and me, the friendship and cooperation between the two countries has grown rapidly and gone a long way. During this time, our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership has not only served the strategic interests of our countries, rather, we have linked it with the development of people and their direct benefits. President Putin and me have taken this relationship to new heights of cooperation through trust and participation. And its achievements have brought not only quantitative but qualitative changes also. First, we have brought co-operation out of the realm of the people and added the immense energy of the private industry. Today we have dozens of business agreements.

Even in the strategic areas like defense, today’sagreement on the manufacturing of spare parts of Russian equipment by Joint Ventures of both the countries in India will promote the industry. This agreement and the joint venture of the AK-203 earlier this year are steps that are giving our defense cooperation a solid foundation of co-manufacturing outside the limited environment of Buyer-Seller. Increasing localization of Nuclear Plants in collaboration with Russia in India is also developing a genuine partnership between us in this field. Second, we are moving our relations beyond the capitals to the states of India and the regions of Russia outside the capitals. This is not surprising because on the one hand I have been the Chief Minister of Gujarat for a long timeand President Putin is also aware of capabilities and potential of Russia's territories. Therefore, it is natural that he conceived the Eastern Economic Forum and understood the importance of connecting a diverse country like India with it. No matter how muchyou appreciate it, less it is.

Immediately after receiving his invitation, we began to prepare very seriously. For this, Commerce Minister of India, Chief Minister of 4 states and more than 150 businessmen came to Vladivostok. Meeting with the special envoy to Far East and all 11 Governors of Far East have given very good results. Relations between states and regions found a framework. And coal, Diamond, Mining, rare earth, agriculture, timber, Pulp & Paper and tourism have revealed many new possibilities. And now a maritime route between Chennai and Vladivostok has also been proposed to increase connectivity between the regions. Third, we have greatly diversified our bilateral cooperation and added new dimensions to it. Nowadays the highlight and headline is the unprecedented investment in each other's hydrocarbon sector, not just oil and gas deals between India and Russia. A 5-year roadmap for cooperation in this sector, and cooperation in the search for Hydro-Carbon and LNG in Far East and the Arctic have been agreed. Our long association in space is touching new heights. Astronauts of India will receive training in Russia for Gaganyan, i.e. Indian Human Space Flight. To achieve the full potential of mutual investment, we have agreed to have an investment protection agreement soon. India's 'Russia Plus Desk' and Russia's Far East Investment and Export Agency's Mumbai office will facilitate mutual investment.

Friends,

To our Strategic Partnership,new chapters are also being added. The immense Tri-Services Exercise 'Indra-2019' between the two countries symbolizes our growing trust and confidence. Whenever the need arises, India and Russia work together not only in ordinary places of the world butin Antarctica and Arctic also. Both countries are well aware that in today's era, multi-polar world is essential for peace and stability. And the role of our cooperation and coordination in building it will be important. Therefore, we intuitively cooperate closely in BRICS, SCO and other global forums. Today we have open and meaningful discussions on many of the major global and regional issues. India wants to see an Afghanistan that is free, secure, unbroken, peaceful and democratic. We are both against external interference in the internal affairs of any country. We also had a fruitful discussions onconcept of India's free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. We agree that India and Russia will cooperate and strengthen in areas such as cyber security, counter-terrorism, environment protection. India and Russia have agreed to organize a High Level Forum on Tiger Conservation next year.

Once again I express my great gratitude to my friend President Putin very much for this invitation and welcome reception. I am looking forward to attending the Eastern Economic Forum with them tomorrow, and with my other leaderfriends. I will wait for President Putin’s visit to India for Annual Summit next year. Russia will chair the SCO and BRICS in the year 2020. I believe that these organizations under President Putin will set new records for success. India and I will have all my personal supportfor this.

Thank you very much
SpasibaBalshoi!

                Following is the text of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s message on Teachers Day.

“Wishing you, and the entire teaching community a Happy Teachers’ Day! 

This is a day to salute the entire teaching fraternity for their hardwork, dedication and commitment. In addition to teaching subjects in the classroom, teachers are exceptional guides and mentors, who play prominent roles on the lives of their students.

The selfless nature of teachers is universally admired. Despite the busy schedules and familial responsibilities, teachers ensure that students are able to learn new ideas and concepts with ease. 

 

Focus on outcomes:

Today, India is witnessing a paradigm shift in the education sector. We have moved away from the conventional approach of merely focusing on outlays and are now giving priority to outcomes. In this context, it makes me happy to see our teachers working hard to ignite a spirit of research and innovation among young minds. It is this spirit that will give our youth the power to do exceptional things for themselves and the nation.

 

Help curb single use plastic:

This Teachers’ Day, I have a request for my fellow teachers. As you are aware, India has taken up a mass movement to eliminate single use plastic. I seek the active support and participation of the teaching community in this movement. If teachers explain to the students the harm caused to our environment by single-use plastic and advice them to shun it, students will feel motivated to become a part of the cause. This would be a great tribute to beloved Bapu on his 150th Jayanti.

On this day, I also pay tributes to the great Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, a brilliant teacher and mentor himself. May his life inspire more people to join the teaching profession and shape young minds.

 

Teachers’ Day greetings once again!”

                I will be visiting Vladivostok, Russia on 4-5 September, 2019.

My visit to Far East Region of Russia, the first by an Indian Prime Minister, underlines the desire on the both sides to diversify and further strengthen the bonds of our robust bilateral relations.

The objective of my visit is two fold- to participate as the Chief Guest at the 5th Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of President of the Russian Federation Mr Vladimir Putin andto hold the 20th India-Russia Annual Summit with him. The Forum focuses on development of business and investment opportunities in the Russian Far East Region, and presents enormous potential for developing close and mutually beneficial cooperation between India and Russia in this region.

Our two Countries enjoy excellent relations, based on the strong foundation of our special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. Both countries cooperate extensively in the strategic fields of defence, civil nuclear energy and peaceful uses of space. We have robust and growing trade and investment relations.

Our strong partnership is complemented by a desire to promote a multipolar world and the two countries closely cooperate towards this end in regional and multilateral fora.

I look forward to discussing with my friend President Putin the entire gamut of our bilateral partnership as well as regional and international issues of mutual interest. I also look forward to meeting other global leaders attending the Eastern Economic Forum, and interacting with Indian Industry and business representatives participating in it.

                Governor of Gujarat Acharya Devvrat ji, Governor of Uttar Pradesh and former Chief Minister of Gujarat Sister Anandi Ben, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani ji, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel ji and all the dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen present here.

I am looking many people after 12-15 years. There are also those who have spent their youth for Gujarat. Many retired officers can be seen who contributed a lot to Gujarat in their time, and consequently the lamp of Gujarat is giving out light.

So I am especially grateful to the Government of Gujarat that I got the opportunity to see you all. Cutting the ribbon of the building is secondary. 

First of all, a very happy Ganesh Chaturthi to all of you. May the grace of Lord Ganesha be on the countrymen! May every resolution of nation building be accomplished! On this auspicious festival, my best wishes to all of you and the countrymen and especially to the people of Gujarat today. 

And on Ganesha Chaturthi in the evening, after the completion of the 'Pratikramana' or introspection, we did carry out a very important task and in the Jain tradition it is the best ceremony 'Michhami Dukadam'. If you have hurt anyone by words or action, then this festival of forgiveness is considered as 'Michhami Dukadam'. So I wish the people of Gujarat, the people of the country, and now even the world, 'Michhami Dukadam'.

I am glad that we have gathered here to celebrate another Siddhi on the festival of Lord Siddhi Vinayak. Garvi Gujarat Sadan is ready to serve all of you in accordance with the feelings, tradition and culture of crores of people of Gujarat. I congratulate all of you, the people of Gujarat for the same.

You have just watched a film on Gujarat Bhawan, but I have just been there. A short while ago, we have got a glimpse of Gujarat culture here. And in a way, the artists have delivered great performances in a short time and less space.

Friends, after the Gujarat Bhavan, now the presence of the Garavi Gujarat Sadan will come in many different ways. I congratulate the friends associated with the construction of this building, who have constructed this magnificent building ahead of schedule.

The foundation stone was laid by the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister two years ago in September and today I have got the opportunity to inaugurate it in the beginning of September itself. I am happy that a habit of completing projects on time is developing in government institutions and government agencies.

And when I was in Gujarat, I used to say with conviction that I will inaugurate the project whose foundation stone has been laid by me. And there was no ego. Only public commitment was there. And because of that all my colleagues had to be engaged in these works. And we used to get results as well. And we not only have to adopt this work culture but also expand it at all levels.

This building may be a model of Mini Gujarat, but it is also a direct proof of our idea of a New India, wherein we talk about moving forward by dovetailing our cultural heritage and traditions with modernity. We want to stay connected to the roots and touch the sky.

And as described in this building, modern systems that are eco friendly, water harvesting, water-recycling facilities are also in full use, while on the other hand there is a depiction of Rani ki Vav. While there is arrangement for solar power generation, there is also a place for Modhera Sun Temple. Besides the modern technology of solid waste management, the Lippan art of Kutch has also been given a place in this building and there animal waste is given the shape of an art.

Brothers and sisters, 

This building can certainly prove to be very important for Gujarat's art & craft and handicrafts as well as for promoting Gujarat's heritage tourism. It is very useful to have this type of facility in the capital of the country, where people and businessmen from all over the world keep visiting.

Similarly, the idea of ​​using the Central Archaeum of the building for exhibitions based on Gujarati culture is also very laudable.

I would urge the Chief Minister that the arrangements for Gujarat tourism here should be strengthened further. Tourists from all over the country can connect with Gujarat through events such as cultural events and food festivals.

There was a time when the people of North India in particular did not like the food of Gujarat and used to say, ""Oh man, Gujarati food is very sweet; you add sugar even in bitter gourd?"" But these days, people ask, ""Where will you find good Gujarati cuisine?"" ""Where do you get good Gujarati Thali? And the specialty of the people of Gujarat is that when they are in Gujarat, they do not cook on Saturday and Sunday evenings, and they go out and look for Italian, Mexican and South Indian dishes. But when they are outside Gujarat, they look for Gujarati dish. And here Khaman is also called Dhokla and Handwa is also called Dhokla. But they belong to the same family. Now if the people of Gujarat do good branding and deliver these things to the people in the right way, then people would know that Khaman, Dhokla and handwa are three different things.

In order to attract investment in Gujarat in the new building, new arrangements have been made for it to become an important centre for industries in Gujarat. And I am confident that with these facilities Indian and foreign investors desirous of investing in Gujarat will get more facilities.

Friends, 

You can imagine that in such a scenario what would happen when people will sit in the modern dining hall of the house and have Dhokla, Fafda, Khandvi, Pudina Muthia, Mohanthal, Thepla Ho, Sev and Tomato Chaat. Once a journalist wanted to interview me. I was then the Chief Minister of Gujarat. And he had a habit of interviewing during breakfast and he used to interview while having breakfast. Well then the interview was good. I knew what to say and what not to say, and I knew more what not to say. But even after that, when he reported, he wrote - I went to Gujarat Bhavan and talked to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, but was disappointed that he did not offer Gujarati breakfast, instead offered South Indian. I would like no one to undergo the same situation now. The Gujarat Bhawan should have its own identity. People should come looking for it.

Gujarat has always attached importance to development, enterprise and labor. I have watched Gujarat's ardour for development as Chief Minister for almost a decade and a half. For the last 5 years I can see that Gujarat has accelerated its journey of development. Initially, Anandiben Patel gave a new energy and strength to the pace of development and later Rupani ji made many new efforts to touch new heights. The growth rate of Gujarat has been more than ten per cent in recent years.

Friends, 

Since the formation of the BJP-led government at the Center and in the state, and the combined efforts of the two governments, many hurdles in the development of Gujarat have been removed. One such hurdle was against the Narmada Dam, and just now Vijay ji has mentioned about it a lot. Today we can see that as soon as the problem has been resolved, the water of Narmada is satiating the thirst of many villages of Gujarat and is benefiting the farmers.

Friends, 

With the growing pace of the two schemes like the SAUNI Yojana and Sujalam-Sufalam scheme, today lakhs of families of Gujarat are getting benefitted. Availability of water in Gujarat is being ensured.

And I am glad that Gujarat has mastered over both water harvesting as well as the campaign to deliver water from village to village. It has accomplished it in systematic way and it also involves participation of its citizens. This has been possible through public participation. And with such efforts, we will be successful in delivering water to every household of the country by 2024.

Besides irrigation, unprecedented investments are also being made in the other sectors of infrastructure in Gujarat during the last five years and the pace of these infrastructure projects has also increased. Many projects of modern infrastructure including metro in Ahmedabad have been completed rapidly. The airports of Baroda, Rajkot, Surat and Ahmedabad have been modernized. Besides this, Dholera Airport and Expressway were approved in Dwarka. As Vijay ji was saying, a bridge was being constructed in Dwarka. Similarly, Railway University, Maritime museum, Marine police academy, Gandhi museum, and many such works, have been carried out in Gujarat in these five years. The Statue of Unity has helped India bring more glory in the Tourist map of the world. Renowned magazines of the world, especially those associated with the tourism sector, discuss the Statue of Unity. And I was reading just a few days ago, and I was happy that on the day of Janmashtami, 34000 people had come to see the Statue of Unity, Sardar Saheb. The arrival of 34000 people in a day is a big thing in itself.

Gujarat has also done a commendable job in providing facilities to the common man and to make their health better. In the last 5-6 years, there has been more rapid work in the medical infrastructure in Gujarat. A network of modern hospitals and medical colleges is being laid in many parts of the state including Ahmedabad. As a result, youth are getting medical education and employment opportunities in Gujarat itself.

Besides health, Gujarat has also been far ahead in implementing the Ujjwala scheme and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. This campaign to make the lives of the people of Gujarat easier, we have to give more momentum to the furthering of Ease of Living.

The cultural, social and economic strength of every state of India makes it great and strong. Therefore, we have to recognize the strengths of every part of the country, every state, and push it forward. They have to be given opportunities at national and global stage. With this common strength, we will be able to accomplish the resolutions that have been set for the coming five years.

There are buildings and bhavans of almost every state in Delhi. These should not be confined merely in the form of guest houses; it should be kept in mind. These Houses of States should be truly representative of the brand of the States in Delhi, communicating with the country and the world, and it is necessary to work for it. Work should also be done to turn these bhavans into centers of tourism and trade.

There are many states in the country which are a little far away in terms of connectivity. Sometimes it takes a lot of time for the business leaders and entrepreneurs from India and abroad to go there from Delhi. When the time is short, it is very useful to have the business centers of that state in the capital of the country to showcase its culture, art and craft.

From Jammu and Kashmir to Leh-Ladakh to the North East, from the tribal regions of the Vindhyas to the maritime expanse of the South, we have much to share with the country and offer to the world. Now we have to increase our activity to promote it. In such a situation, there should be such an arrangement in the state buildings or bhavans so that anyone can go there and get answers to all the questions ranging from tourism to investment.

I once again congratulate you all very much for Garvi Gujarat. And I hope while tasting the cuisine of Gujarat, it must be kept in mind that we have to liberate the country from single-use plastic. I believe that in this mission too, Garvi Gujarat Sadan will set an example.

Once again congratulations to all of you for this new building and my best wishes. And it's good to see a lot of people from the mission here. So, we should keep inviting the people of the mission to Gujarat Bhavan from time to time, then your business will grow automatically. So this should be done.

Thank you very much and best wishes!

                In a major health and wellness initiative for the country, the Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Promulgation of the Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (production, manufacture, import, export, transport, sale, distribution, storage and advertisement) Ordinance, 2019.

Electronic-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that produce aerosol by heating a solution containing nicotine, which is the addictive substance in combustible cigarettes. These include all forms of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, Heat Not Burn Products, e-Hookah and the like devices. These novel products come with attractive appearances and multiple flavours and their use has increased exponentially and has acquired epidemic proportions in developed countries, especially among youth and children.

Implementation:

Upon promulgation of the Ordinance, any production, manufacturing, import, export, transport, sale (including online sale), distribution or advertisement (including online advertisement) of e-cigarettes shall be a cognizable offence punishable with an imprisonment of up to one year or fine up to Rs. 1 lakh or both for the first offence; and imprisonment of up to three years and fine up to Rs. 5 lakh for a subsequent offence. Storage of electronic-cigarettes shall also be punishable with an imprisonment up to 6 months or fine up to Rs 50,000 or both.  

The owners of existing stocks of e-cigarettes on the date of commencement of the Ordinance will have to suomoto declare and deposit these stocks with the nearest police station. The Sub-Inspector of Police has been designated as the Authorized Officer to take action under the Ordinance. The Central or State Governments may also designate any other equivalent officer(s) as Authorized Officer for enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance.



MAJOR IMPACT:

The decision to prohibit e-cigarettes will help protect population, especially the youth and children, from the risk of addiction through E-cigarettes.   Enforcement of the Ordinance will complement government's efforts for tobacco control and will help in reduction of tobacco use and reduction in associated economic and disease burden.

BACKGROUND:

The current decision has come on the back of an advisory issued by the Government in 2018 to all States to consider banning e-cigarettes. 16 States and 1 UT have already banned e cigarettes in their jurisdictions. Notably, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in a recent white paper on the subject, also recommended a complete ban on e-cigarettes based on currently available scientific evidence. The WHO has also urged member countries to take appropriate steps including prohibiting these products. These products are usually marketed as being safer alternatives for conventional cigarettes but such notions of safety are false. On the other hand, available literature suggests that these products may act as gateway products to induce non-smokers, especially youth and adolescents, to nicotine-use, leading to addiction and subsequent use of conventional tobacco products. E-cigarettes are usually promoted by the industry as smoking cessation aids but their efficacy and safety as a quitting aid has not yet been established.

Unlike the tried and tested nicotine and non-nicotine pharmacotherapies that are known to help people quit tobacco use, the WHO does not endorse e-cigarettes as cessation aids. The possibility of tobacco industry interference in tobacco cessation efforts through misinformation about the potential benefits of these products, which are presented as alternatives but in most cases are complementary to the use of conventional tobacco products, also is a present and real possibility. Apart from nicotine, e-cigarettes may also be used for delivery of other psychoactive substances. Scientifically proven nicotine replacement therapies, without the risks associated with e-cigarettes, exist in the form of gums, lozenges and patches for those willing to quit tobacco use. Widespread use and unchecked proliferation of e-cigarettes and the like devices would seriously undermine and derail Government's efforts to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use.

Considering the highly addictive nature of nicotine; safety concern of flavours in combination with nicotine; risk of use of other psychoactive substances through these devices; initiation of nicotine or psychoactive substances by non-smokers, especially adolescents and youth; dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes; scant scientific evidence for use of e-cigarettes as effective tobacco cessation aids; threat to country's tobacco control efforts; hindrance in achieving the targets envisaged under Sustainable Development Goals, National Monitoring Framework for Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases and National Health Policy, 2017; and in overall interest of public health as envisaged under Article 47 of the Constitution of India, the decision has been taken to prohibit/ban e-cigarettes including all forms of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems [ENDS), Heat Not Burn Products, e-Hookah and the like devices.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the payment of Productivity Linked Bonus (PLB) equivalent to 78 days wages to over 11.52 Lakh eligible non-gazetted railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) for the Financial Year (FY) 2018-19, for maintaining industrial peace and motivation of railwaymen. This entails an expenditure of Rs. 2024.40 crores to the exchequer.

This is the sixth consecutive year that the Government led by Mr Narendra Modi has maintained a bonus of 78 days wages. It has never lowered it.



Benefits:

Payment of PLB equivalent to 78 days wages to eligible railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) for the FY 2018-19 would result in motivating a large number of railway employees to improve the performance of the Railways and enhance the productivity levels further, besides maintaining industrial peace.

PLB to all non-gazetted railway employees is an acknowledgement of their contribution to the efficient running of the Railways.

There being large number of railwaymen and their families, this acknowledgement will enhance the sense of inclusiveness and equity among them.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Infusion of Rs 4,557 crore by Government in IDBI Bank.

 

It will help in completing the process of IDBI Bank’s turnaround and enable it to return to profitability and normal lending, and giving Government the option of recovering its investment at an opportune time.

 

IDBI Bank needs a one time infusion of capital to complete the exercise of dealing with its legacy book. It has already substantially cleaned up, reducing net NPA from peak of 18.8% in June 2018 to 8% in June 2019. The capital for this has to come from its shareholders. LIC is at 51% and is not allowed to go higher by the insurance regulator. Of the Rs. 9,300 crore needed, LIC would meet 51% (Rs. 4,743 crore). Remaining 49%, amounting to Rs. 4,557 crore, is proposed from Government as its share on one time basis.

 

After this infusion, IDBI Bank expects to be able to subsequently raise further capital on its own and expects to come out of RBI’s Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework sometime next year. This cash neutral infusion will be through recap bonds i.e. Government infusing capital into the bank and the bank buying the recap bond from the Government the same day, with no impact on liquidity or current year’s Budget.

 

Background:

Following Cabinet’s approval in August 2018, LIC acquired 51% stake in IDBI Bank. Government continues to be a promoter and holds 46.46% stake.

 

The financial parameters of IDBI Bank have improved considerably during the last one year:


	CRAR has improved from 6.22% as on 30.9.18 to 11.58% as on 31.3.19.
	Net NPA ratio reduced from 17.3% as on 30.9.18 to 10.11% as on 31.3.19 and further to 8.02% as on 30th June 2019
	Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) improved from 69% (30.9.18) to 83% (31.3.19) and further to 88% on 30th June 2019
	Synergy with LIC has enabled access to 29 crore policyholders base spread over 3184 branches and also to 11 lakh agents and 2 lakh employees of LIC.
	Rs.500 crore revenue for FY 2020 and Rs.1,000 crore from FY 2021 onwards projected from LIC Synergy.
	Sale of insurance kick-started in March 2019 with Rs.160 crore premium. This momentum has continued with over Rs. 250 Cr premium collection in first four and a half months of this year. FY 2019-20 target is Rs.2000 crore of premium and Rs. 200 crore revenue.
	Additional business anticipated is Rs.5,000 crore (Housing loan, Auto loan, personal loan) by leveraging LIC agents’ network.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for the following, including fixing higher ethanol price derived from different raw materials under the EBP Programme for the forthcoming sugar season 2019-20 during ethanol supply year from 1st December 2019 to 30th November 2020: 

 

(i)         The price of ethanol from C heavy molasses route be increased from Rs.43.46 per lit to Rs.43.75 per litre, 

(ii)        The price of ethanol from B heavy molasses route be increased from Rs.52.43 per lit to Rs.54.27 per litre, 

(iii)       The price of ethanol from sugarcane juice/sugar/sugar syrup route be fixed at Rs.59.48 per litre, 

(iv)       Additionally, GST and transportation charges will also be payable. OMCs have been advised to fix realistic transportation charges so that long distance transportation of ethanol is not disincentivised,

(v)        OMCs are advised to continue according priority of ethanol from 1) sugarcane juice/sugar/sugar syrup, 2) B heavy molasses 3) C heavy molasses and 4) Damaged Food grains/other sources, in that order,

 

All distilleries will be able to take benefit of the scheme and large number of them are expected to supply ethanol for the EBP programme. Remunerative price to ethanol suppliers will help in reduction of cane farmer’s arrears, in the process contributing to minimizing difficulty of sugarcane farmers. 

Ethanol availability for EBP Programme is expected to increase significantly due to higher price being offered for procurement of ethanol from all the sugarcane based routes, subsuming “partial sugarcane juice route” and “100% sugarcane juice route” under “sugarcane juice route” and for the first time allowing sugar and sugar syrup for ethanol production. Increased ethanol blending in petrol has many benefits including reduction in import dependency, support to agricultural sector, more environmental friendly fuel, lesser pollution and additional income to farmers.

 

Background:

Government has been implementing Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme wherein OMCs sell petrol blended with ethanol up to 10%. This programme has been extended to whole of India except Union Territories of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands with effect from 01st April, 2019 to promote the use of alternative and environment friendly fuels. This intervention also seeks to reduce import dependence for energy requirements and give boost to agriculture sector.

Government has notified administered price of ethanol since 2014. For the first time during 2018, differential price of ethanol based on raw material utilized for ethanol production was announced by the Government. These decisions have significantly improved the supply of ethanol thereby ethanol procurement by Public Sector OMCs has increased from 38 crore litre in ethanol supply year 2013-14 to estimated over 200 crore litre in 2018-19.

Consistent surplus of sugar production is depressing sugar price. Consequently, sugarcane farmer’s dues have increased due to lower capability of sugar industry to pay the farmers. Government has taken many decisions for reduction of cane farmer’s dues.

With a view to limit sugar production in the Country and to increase domestic production of ethanol, Government has taken multiple steps including, allowing diversion of B heavy molasses and sugarcane juice for ethanol production. As the ex-mill price of sugar and conversion cost have undergone changes, there is a need to revise the ex-mill price of ethanol derived from different sugarcane based raw materials. There is also a demand from the industry to include sugar and sugar syrup for ethanol production to help in solving the problem of inventory and liquidity with the sugar mills.

                Union Minister of State (I/C) for Development of North Eastern Region, MoS PMO, Personnel, Atomic Energy and Department of Space Dr. Jitendra Singh said that space technology has reached almost every house in five years under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He said, “Our Prime Minister has a naturally scientific nature. He never fails to promote scientists and the example is Chandrayaan Mission. He was present to witness Chandrayaan's landing."" The Minister was speaking during the inaugural session of National Conference on ‘System for Transforming India: Challenges and Opportunities’ at Space Application Centre, Ahmedabad today.

Emphasizing the use of space technology for the common people, the Minister said that there are some examples of the use of space technology such as road transport, railway, unmanned railway crossing and geotagging of works under MNREGA. He said that three to four years ago, there were reports of accidents at unmanned railway crossings. But the use of space technology has shown a significant reduction in such accidents. He further said that it was difficult to get the Fund Utilization Certificate in the North East region. With the use of space technology, it became possible to get such stuck fund utilization certificate of worth Rs. 7000 crore.

Praising ISRO and the Department of Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that ISRO has built a work culture through dedication and commitment that other scientific communities should follow. ""I can say with pride that India will soon become a superpower and this journey will start with the Department of Space."", he said.

ISRO Chairman Dr. K Sivan said, “Young generation should come forward to shape the future of the country.” He added that the system engineering defines the complex system. The purpose of system engineering is not limited to building a best & optimal system, but to build a system that is feasible and serve a purpose. “The system engineering reduces the risk involved in space missions”, he said.

The two-day national conference was organized by the Indian Society of Systems for Science and Engineering (ISSE) and the Space Application Centre. During the inaugural ceremony, the Minister released the souvenir of the conference and conferred ISSE awards.

                The 63rd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is presently going on at Vienna (September 16 -20, 2019). Following is the statement made today (18-09-2019) by Dr. K N Vyas, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission and Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India and Head of the Indian delegation to the conference:

“I take this opportunity to convey on behalf of the people of India and the Government of India the warmest greetings to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Member States on the occasion of the 63rd General Conference.

I also join my other colleagues to express our deep condolences on the sad demise of DG Amano in July this year. His contribution to IAEA is well known. We in India very fondly remember his visits to our country and his helpful nature. During his tenure, we brought 12 facilities under IAEA safeguards and signed the Additional Protocol to the India-IAEA Agreement for the Applications of Safeguards to Civil Nuclear Facilities. DG Amano’s contribution will be remembered forever, especially his vision of “Atoms for Peace and Development” which has global relevance. India whole heartedly supports designating The Flexible Modular Laboratory at Seibersdorf as Yukia Amano Laboratories. 

Let me congratulate you Madam President on your election as the President of the 63rd General Conference. I am sure that under your able leadership the current General Conference will accomplish all the tasks laid before it successfully. 

As in the previous years, during this year too, India’s interaction with IAEA has remained significant. I am happy to share that the 27th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference (FEC-2018), a forum for discussions on key physics and technology issues was held at Gandhinagar, Gujarat, in October 2018. This saw great success as more than 700 experts from 39 countries participated in the Conference. 131 oral & 641 poster presentations and showcasing of products enriched the Conference. 

Out of 19 programmes organized at the Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership in India in 2018-19, eight were conducted jointly with the IAEA, thus reinforcing India’s collaboration with IAEA in capacity building.  

I am very pleased to share with you that India’s Kaiga Generating Station (KGS-1) has set a new world record of continuous operation for 962 days on 31 December 2018 while working at 99.3% plant load factor. 

Tarapur Atomic Power Station Units (TAPS 1 &2), connected to grid in April and May 1969, have completed 50 years of safe operation. These are currently the oldest operating power reactors in the world, producing nuclear power at less than 3 cents per unit. Such achievements demonstrate India’s ability to design, build and reliably operate PHWRs & LWRs.

India has plan for capacity addition in nuclear power generation and presently we have 21 reactors under the stage of construction and planning. This will help in achieving an additional capacity of about 15,000 MWe.   

Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC), a unit under DAE, has completed the supply of fuel bundles to KAPS-3, the first 700 MWe PHWR, towards initial core requirement.

Apsara-U, an upgraded swimming pool type reactor, operational since September 2018, has been operated at 90% of rated power and demonstrated that it can produce carrier free Cu-64 radioisotope, which has potential for usage in PET scans.

The U-233 fuelled Kalpakkam Mini Reactor (KAMINI) has continued its successful operation. It is being used for neutron radiography of a large number of pyro-devices from the Indian Space Research Organization, activation analysis, neutron detector testing, etc. 

Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), a unit under DAE, today has seven hospitals and one research institute catering to the needs of more than half a million patients every year, among which, ~100,000 are new patients.

I am very happy to share with you that yesterday we have launched a global cancer care network, “NCG-Vishwam Cancer Care Connect” (NCG-Vishwam 3C) during our side event. NCG-Vishwam envisages integration of the hospitals and relevant cancer care institutes in partner countries with the National Cancer Grid (NCG) of India. NCG managed by Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), was established in 2012 with the vision of creating uniform standards of cancer care across India and this has grown to a large network of 183 cancer centres, and hospitals.

We hope that NCG-Vishwam 3C will bring a paradigm shift in cancer care in the form of sharing guidelines for management of   common cancer, giving second opinion, deciding on treatment, sharing online resources, etc.

India has made huge progress in utilisation of radiation technologies for societal uses. We are willing to share our knowledge and expertise with our friendly partners. The process has already set in through increased interactions and actual collaborations in all areas of nuclear technologies concerning human life, be it power, health, agriculture or human capital development. We are determined to take this collaboration to a higher level.  

We also acknowledge the dynamic role played by the IAEA in guiding peaceful uses of nuclear energy, ensuring safety and security, and look forward to the Agency’s continued and vital support for providing a conducive atmosphere for the growth of nuclear science and technology.

I conclude by thanking Government of Austria and its people for hosting the IAEA and the General Conference and wish the 63rd Conference a grand success.”

                Shri K. N. Vyas, Secretary DAE & Chairman AEC launched NCG Vishwam Cancer Care Connect on 17th September 2019 in Vienna on the sidelines of 63rd General conference of IAEA. By virtue of this, National Cancer Grid (NCG) established and managed by Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), which has 183 participating stake holders from India has been made open to the cancer hospitals and other relevant institutes from foreign countries. Dr. Rajendra Badwe, Director, Tata Memorial Centre (TMC) gave the details of NCG and how it could be extended to the foreign hospitals and the benefits which they shall accrue. 

The objective of the NCG has been removing the disparity in Cancer Care. The NCG Vishwam is expected to play the same role globally. Eleven countries expressed interest immediately after the launch. Hospitals from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh conveyed their appreciation through a video message of offering the NCG to foreign countries. Ms. May Abdel-Wahab, Director, NAHU, IAEA conveyed appreciation of IAEA on the launch of NCG Vishwam, called it as comprehensive package help bridging the gap in cancer care and underlined IAEA’s support to the initiative. Official logo of NCG Vishwam Cancer Care Connect was launched on the occasion. [In the logo, uses three Cs of ‘Cancer Care Connect’ together to form an earthen lamp, whose flame is represented by a red dot. The red dot is also symbolic of kumkum, while its orientation represents an eye. The lamp projects prosperity and life whereas the flame is a mark of freedom through enlightenment.]           

The speech delivered by Chairman AEC at the time of launch is as follows:

“Cancer Care is an integral part of the responsibilities of the Department of Atomic Energy. The radioisotopes for detection of cancer and treatment are exclusively produced by the Department. The Department is also involved in development of newer radiopharmaceuticals. A cobalt teletherapy machine, called Bhabhatron, for cancer treatment, has also been developed by the Department.  

The Tata Memorial Centre (or TMC), which is an integral part of the Department, has been a premier cancer care facility since 1941 and it has struck an excellent balance with trilogy of patient care, education and research. The Centre has championed cost effective interventions, accessible all over India. Research conducted at the Centre has saved many lives across the globe. The Centre offers state of the art training to create human resource for cancer care.

TMC today has seven hospitals and one research institute catering to the needs of more than half a million patients every year, among which there are ~100,000 new patients. 

I am very happy to announce that India is launching a global cancer care network, “NCG-Vishwam Cancer Care Connect” (NCG-Vishwam 3C). Vishwam is a Sanskrit word, which means Universal or Global. Through this connect, we shall join hands with all interested partner countries in our fight against Cancer.

NCG-Vishwam envisages integration of the hospitals and relevant cancer care institutes from partner countries with the National Cancer Grid (NCG) of India. NCG is managed by TMC and was established in 2012 with the broad vision for creating uniform standards of cancer care across India. In the short span of seven years, it has grown to a large network of 183 cancer centres, research institutes, patient advocacy groups, charitable organizations and professional societies. Incorporating virtually all stakeholders of cancer care in India, it has now become a strong, unified and powerful System in the fight against cancer.

We have been receiving requests from a number of partner countries for sharing the platform and this has been the incentive for the launch of NCG-Vishwam 3C. We invite Member States to be a partner in this noble cause.

Our partner countries shall benefit in different ways through the NCG Vishwam connect, such as NCG guidelines for management of common cancers; Second Opinion Service for patients/ physicians; decisions on treatment; availability of massive open online courses; etc. I am happy that different hospitals from Russia, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Nepal, United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Jamaica, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Zambia have agreed to become part of the NCG-Vishwam.”

                The third 2 days’ workshop on Electoral Literacy Clubs (ELCs)for State Level Master Trainers & SVEEP Nodal Officer of Election Commission of India commenced on 30th September, 2019 at the IIIDEM Campus, New Delhi.  After Lok Sabha Election 2019, it was decided to conduct workshops for effective establishment and working of ELCs as well as to strategize on the way forward.  Two such workshops have already been held on 23-24 and 26-27 September, 2019.



 The Chief Election Commissioner, Sh. Sunil Arora inaugurated ELC exhibition, wherein glimpses of the ELC activities carried out in the workshops were shown to the Commission alongwith ELC resources. Thereafter, addressing the special session of the workshop, Chief Election Commissioner, Sh Sunil Arora said, “Despite attaining a historic turnout we should strive for more and make sustained & dedicated efforts to sensitise people from all over the communities and enhance participation even further.  While interacting with the participants, he said, “You all are brick and mortar of the SVEEP programme of ECI. Having been entrusted with the responsibility of being part of this gigantic effort, I urge you to be pioneers of the ELC project on the field and ensure that the power of indelible ink represents all.”  Senior Deputy Election Commissioner, Shri Umesh Sinha and Director General of IIIDEM Sh Dharmendra Sharma were also present at the occasion alongwith other senior officers of Election Commission of India. 

Briefing on ELC project, Sr DEC Sh Umesh Sinha emphasized on the importance of having a strong foundation, he stated that“Unless you have a proper root, the grass will not grow. Our aim is to have all eligible voters to register in the electoral roll and ensure it is 100% error free in order to strengthen our democracy even further. One of the main objectives of Voter Education is to make the voters informed and ethical and help in enhancing their participation.  He further added that the ELC project requires a robust movement and momentum by all present by reaching out to schools, colleges, communities, organizations etc.’ Mr. Sinha envisioned further stating that Electoral literacy Club would be the biggest electoral literacy movement in the world and through this we can fulfill the aim of  ‘No Voter to be Left Behind’ .

 



Under its flagship programme ‘Systematic Voters’ Education & Electoral Participation’ (SVEEP), the project for Mainstreaming of Electoral Literacy through Educational Institutions/ Organizations was introduced which envisages setting up of Electoral Literacy Club in every educational institution and Chunav Pathshala at every booth to cover those outside the formal education system.  Launched on 8th National Voters’ Day on 25th January, 2018, ELCs shall serve as a vibrant hub of Electoral Literacy for developing and strengthening the culture of electoral participation through hands on experience.Till now 5,80,620ELCs have been established across the country.



The entire project revolves around keeping voter education relevant and practical through a host of co-curricular and extra-curricular methods for the young and future voters. The ELCs and Chunav Pathshala activities are conducted by the Convener using a resource Guide where step by step instructions are given for conducting each activity.  Separate Resource books have been developed for Class IX to XII, colleges and communities. A calendar of activities in a year has also been indicated.Total of 6-8 activities, with specific learning outcome, running into approximately 4 hours in all, have been identified for each category.

The purpose of the workshop is to provide a refresher of ELC activities to the participants in order to ensure their preparedness for subsequent trainings that they shall be conducting with District Level Master Trainers. Commission’s endeavor is to make the ELC project sustainable and to achieve its vision of establishing 1.5 million ELCs in 2 hundred thousand secondary and senior secondary schools, 27 thousand colleges and universities and the 1 million polling stations.

                The Election Commission of India today organized a Briefing for Observers to be deployed for Elections to be held next month for the Haryana and Maharashtra Legislative Assemblies. Around 500 officers drawn from IAS, IPS officers as also from Indian Revenue Service and few other Central Services attended the briefing meeting. These officers are being deployed as General, Police and Expenditure Observers. 

Reminding the Observers of their crucial role, Chief Election Commissioner Sh. Sunil Arora emphasised on the conduct of elections in a transparent, participative & voter friendly manner, more so for Persons with Disabilities and Senior Citizens who need assistance. He stated that the Observers should ensure strict compliance of ECI's rules and Standard Operating Procedures to be followed. Sh Sunil Arora pointed out that the officers need to be extremely careful to ensure that no mistakes are committed. Sh Arora cautioned that even the most minor of mistakes at times spiral into avoidable news reporting. He said the Observers as ECI appointed nominees need to be vigilant, neutral and responsive in their approach to all stakeholders at field level. Sh Arora noted that keeping in view specific requirements, the Commission has also appointed two Special Expenditure Observers for the State of Maharashtra viz  Ms Madhu Mahajan (ex IRS 1982) who, given her past experience in Investigations Wing of Income Tax department, was appointed Special Expenditure Observer for Tamil Nadu in recent Lok Sabha elections also and Sh B Murali Kumar (ex IRS 1983) who was also appointed Special Expenditure Observer for 8-Vellore Parliamentary Constituency during Lok Sabha Elections and had served as DGIT(Inv.), Chennai earlier. 

            Election Commissioner Sh Ashok Lavasa noted that ECI's procedures for the field level functionaries are well laid out. ""ECI expects and depends a lot on the Observers as the ground level officers also depend a lot on expert advice and impartial perspective of the Observers so posted'', Sh Lavasa added. The Election Commissioner said ECI has developed the Observers' App and other tech-tools such as CVigil to aid the officers, though it is expected that the Observers would be alert and discharge their duties faithfully at all times. 

            Addressing the group, Election Commissioner Sh Sushil Chandra drew the attention of the Officers that as Observers they have a crucial statutory duty to perform on behalf of Election Commission of India. He exhorted the officers to observe all due details with respect to smooth conduct of elections on the ground level - be it the Assured Minimum Facilities at Polling stations or the diligent following of laid down procedures of mock poll, etc for Electronic Voting Machines or enforcement of expenditure guidelines and coordinated functioning among all agencies to take preventive measures to ensure free and fair elections. He pointed out that the role of Expenditure Observers has become quite significant in current milieu.  The Observers should keep a keen eye on all key election functionaries at the field and should act as eyes & ears of the Commission , Sh Chandra added.

 

            During the half-day long briefing sessions, the officers were given comprehensive and thorough inputs about the various aspects of election management by the Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Planning & SVEEP Sh Umesh Sinha as also on aspects of Electoral Roll, IT Applications, Model Code of Conduct by Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Sh Sandeep Saxsena. Sh Saxsena also as State in-charge of Elections for Haryana briefed the officers on ground-level concerns of the State of Haryana.  DEC Sh Chandra Bhushan as State in-charge of Maharashtra and one handling legal provisions at the Commission, briefed the Observers on details to be followed. DEC Sh Sudeep jain briefed the Observers on EVM-VVPAT protocols to be monitored. Detailed thematic presentations were made on Election planning, Observer’s roles and responsibilities, electoral roll issues, enforcement of Model Code of Conduct, legal provisions, EVM/VVPAT management, media engagement and the wide array of activities undertaken for voter facilitation under the Commission’s flagship SVEEP (Systematic Voter’s Education and Electoral Participation) programme. The Observers were also acquainted with the various IT initiatives and expenditure guidelines. 

            Using the Observers App, General, Police and Expenditure observers can submit their report securely to ECI to upload the relevant document from the mobile app. The Observers will get all important notifications, alerts, and urgent messages on this App while they are on duty. It will also facilitate observers to get their deployment status, download the ID card and update their profile. The Observers can make a written observation after the flying squads have investigated the matter. Observers are put on deputation with ECI for the entire duration of the Election Process till end of October 2019.

                Chief Election Commissioner, Shri Sunil Arora today assumed Chairmanship of Association of World Election Bodies (AWEB) for the term 2019-21 as India takes over the Chair from Romania. India was unanimously nominated to be the Vice-Chair of AWEB at the last General Assembly held at Bucharest in 2017. The AWEB Flag was handed over to the new Chairman, Sh.

EMBs from Ukraine, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Political Parties Registration Commission of Sierra Leone, Indonesia and Mauritius joined the A-WEB family as Members and the Association of Asian Election Authorities (AAEA) as an Associate Member.

Sh Arora also noted that a number of nascent democracies are still working on to stabilize their political system through improving their electoral and legal systems. Shri Arora highlighted “This is where organizations such as A-WEB provide valuable contribution, professional support and advice by sharing innovations, experience and skills with support from and participation of its Members. Free, fair, credible and professionally managed elections form the bedrock of a healthy and vibrant democracy” Since its inception in October 2013, A-WEB has marched ahead empowering the democratic framework of member countries.    With 120 EMBs from 111 countries as its Members and 21 International Organisations as Associate Members, it has truly become the largest global organisation of Election Management Bodies providing momentum to the spread of electoral democracy, the Chair noted.

                            Chief Election Commissioner of India Shri Sunil Arora today spoke to the Extraordinary Session of the Executive Board of Association of World Election Bodies in Bengaluru. Sh Arora recalled that Election Commission of India had been closely associated with the formation process of the A-WEB during 2011-12, and was one of the founding members of AWEB in October 2013. India has been member of the Executive Board since 2013 and took over as Vice-Chair of AWEB since 2017. India continues to promote AWEB’s mission wholeheartedly to promote partnership among Electoral Management Bodies (EMBs) around the world.

           Speaking on the occasion, Sh Arora said the constituent units of the A-WEB are the Electoral Management Bodies (EMBs) of different countries, structured to work together and learn from the experiences and best practices from one another. With 115 EMBs from 109 countries as its members, and 20 international organizations as Associate Members, the A-WEB has truly become a global organization to strengthen electoral management in a non-invasive manner.

 

          Citing Thomas Alva Edison – “Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration”, Sh Arora said it is especially true about democracy. “It is a very noble idea, which has inspired generation of patriots, reformers and humanists. But it takes a lot of imagination, diligence and professionalism to implement it on ground level. Eternal Vigilance is price that Democratic Countries pay for liberty, said Sh Arora.” He added “This is particularly true of emerging democracies where despite the political will of the citizens, the persisting statusquoist system suffers from ingrained weakness of institutions and trained manpower to conduct free, fair and participatory elections in a transparent manner. An electoral miscarriage might breed distrust towards democratic institutions, he cautioned. “This is where the importance of a multi-lateral organization like A-WEB comes to the fore”, he stated.

                Shri Arora recounted that the framers of Indian Constitution were such visionaries that they chose to setup the institution of Election Commission on 25th January 1950 ie. one day before promulgation and formal adoption of our constitution on 26th January 1950. He said Election Commission of India (ECI) has successfully conducted 17 national elections and 388 state elections, thus strengthening the nation’s faith in electoral democracy. He added “ECI stands today as an institution of repute in imparting knowledge and sharing of best practices and skills with other EMBs through its robust International Cooperation Programme.” ECI has signed Memorandum of Understanding on Electoral Cooperation with 26 EMBs and International Organisations.   

 

         Shri Arora complimented Mr. Yong-Hi Kim, the current Secretary General of AWEB and his colleagues at the Secretariat for successfully organising various training programmes and conferences and other activities year after year fostering promotion of exchange and cooperation among participating EMBs.  

 

            Mr. Ion Mincu Radulescu, Adviser in the Permanent Electoral Authority of Romania, representing the Chairperson of A-WEB, Chairpersons/Presidents and senior delegates from  Election Management Bodies  of   Bangladesh; Burkina Faso; Dominican Republic; El Salvador; Fiji; Kenya; Malawi; Palestine; Paraguay; Tunisia & Uzbekistan were present as Members of the A-WEB Executive Board. Also participating in the meeting were Presidents and senior delegates from Election Management Bodies of Cameroon & Ecuador as also members of the Oversight and Audit Committee of A-WEB. Current Secretary General Mr. Yong Hi Kim and senior officials of A-WEB and ECI attended today’s session.

 

            More than 120 delegates from 50 countries across the globe have come to Bengaluru for the AWEB’s meetings being held from 02nd to 04th September, 2019. By far this is the largest congregation of EMB delegates in India.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials met today with the representatives of the Trade and Industry bodies in Sikkim.

 

 The Commission observed that:

 


	Sikkim has been able to sustain a relatively higher growth in income. The trend growth rate of nominal growth rate of GSDP has been 13.5% from 2011 to 2018. This was as high as 24.9% from 2005 to 2018. The high growth rate has been mainly due to hydro-power sector and pharmaceutical industries. 
	The State has abundant opportunities in areas of tourism, horticulture & floriculture, organic products, pharmaceuticals and ethnic handlooms/handicrafts.
	59% of State’s GSVA comes from Secondary sector. This is very high as compared to other States.
	However, according to Ease of Doing Business ranking-2017-18, Sikkim is third lowest after Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. The State has given the following reasons for its low ranking in Ease of Doing business: 
	
		Sikkim currently does not have a Companies Act, as after the repeal of the old Act, new Companies Act has not been notified.
		It is an environmentally sensitive zone so the clearance cannot be automatic as each issue needs a closer look. 
		The land laws protect the interest of ethic community and any change of title requires approval at highest level.
	
	
	According to 5th Employment Un-employment survey of Labour Bureau 2015-16, Sikkim has second highest unemployment rate (after Tripura) of 18.1 per cent. This implies jobless growth in the State.
	Growth rate of GSDP has not kept pace with revenues of the State. 


 

Regarding the Infrastructure issues and poor connectivity in Sikkim, the Commission observed:

 


	A small airport with limited capacity has become operational, however the number of flights to the airport are limited are not frequent. 
	Sikkim also lacks rail networks.
	The State is entirely dependent on the National Highway-10(NH-10), the only link with the rest of the country. The frequent road disruptions due to natural calamities on this single lane road creates huge problem for transportation of goods resulting in rise in prices of essential goods and high cost of living in the State. 


 

Difficult geographical terrain, recurring devastation and its impact on maintaining assets are other challenges for development of manufacturing industries in Sikkim.

 

According to the State Memorandum –

 


	The tax collected before GST regime from some of the ancillary industries associated with pharmaceuticals, has been flowing out in the form of input tax credit to main producers. 
	Sikkim did not need GST compensation in year 2018-19.


 

Representatives of Sikkim Chamber of Commerce, Cipla Pharmaceutical, Zuventus Pharmaceutical, Intas Pharmaceutical, Marchak Manufacturing Pvt. Ltd. Corrugated Boxes, Sikkim Distilleries Ltd., Sun Pharmaceuticals, Mato-Potter, Designer Candles, Temi Tea Estate, Tea Bag & Flavoured Tea, Bamboo Handicrafts, Govt. Fruit Preservation  and Simsar Bakery attended the meeting.

The Commission noted all the concerns highlighted by the representatives of the Sikkim Trade and Industry and promised to address them in its recommendations to the Central Government.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials met today with the Shri Prem Singh Tamang, Chief Minister of Sikkim alongwith his Cabinet colleagues and senior State Government officials.

The Commission observed that:


	The State has good potential in tourism, organic farming and horticulture. It may establish more cold storages, value chains and develop food processing industries. 
	Sikkim was the first State to be declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) in India.
	Sikkim has the second highest per capita income and low BPL population:


 


	
	
		Per capita income of Sikkim is Rs 2,97,765 (second highest after Goa) while India’s average is Rs 1,14,958 in 2017-18. Per capita income is more than double of the country’s per capita income.
		Below poverty line (BPL) population in Sikkim is only 8.19% while the country’s average is 21.9% (Tendulkar methodology, 2011-2). Sikkim witnessed a significant decline in BPL population by 23 percentage points from 2004-05 to 2011-12.
	
	


 


	High share of GSDP from secondary sector: The production of electricity from hydropower units and production of the pharmaceutical industries increased the relative share of secondary sector which contributes about 59% of GSDP. Sikkim has good potential of hydropower sector. State should speed up the execution of the ongoing Hydel Projects so as to exploit the potential and to increase the revenue earnings.


Sound debt and deficit indicators: 


	
	
		The fiscal deficit of the State has remained under 3% in recent years except in 2018-19 (RE). State is mostly revenue surplus. Debt to GSDP ratio has also remained moderate at 23.2% in 2016-17 which is lower than the average of 28.6% all North-East and Hill States. However, it has increased slightly in recent years. Also, AG Sikkim has informed of significant off-budget borrowings amounting to Rs 3628 crores of the State Government. 
		The introduction of State FRBM Act in 2010-11 provided the rule based fiscal management with defined deficit and debt targets. The State managed to avail the flexibility of increasing the fiscal deficit by 0.5 per cent in 2017-18 by satisfying the condition relating revenue surplus and debt stock as recommended by the FC-XIV.
	
	


 

According to the 5th Employment Un-employment survey of Labour Bureau 2015-16, Sikkim has second highest unemployment rate of 18.1 per cent (after Tripura). High per capita income and good share of secondary sector in GSDP is paradoxical to the high unemployment rate hinting towards jobless growth.

Sikkim has third lowest own-tax revenues out of all States, in spite of having second highest per capita income. Due to sparse own resource base, the State depends heavily on transfer of resources from the Central Government. It receives 75% of its total Revenue Receipts from Union Government. 

The own non-tax revenue remains an important source of revenue for the State.   It constitutes about 40 to 50 % of the own revenue receipts. However, NTR has declined significantly in last few years due to fall in revenues from lottery. It has a trend growth rate of (-10.9%) from 2011 to 2018. State has potential to increase its earnings through Hydro-power sector and tourism which should be explored.

 

The Commission was informed that:          

There are 15 PSUs in the State out of which 7 are non-working. As on 31 August 2019, 11 accounts of four working SPSUs and one account of one non-working SPSU were in arrears.The accumulated losses of 9 SPSUs have increased from ₹ 53.82 crore (2012-13) to ₹ 1,013.27  crore (2017-18). (AG, Sikkim)

 

In Sikkim, the Energy & Power Department is solely responsible for supply of electricity in the State of Sikkim. Power Department of State Government does generation, transmission, distribution and trading of power. State Government gives heavy subsidy to rural consumers on electricity. Also, 15% of the consumers were not metered as on 31.03.2017.  AT&C losses are about 33% and ACS-ARR gap is 6.93 which is extremely high (M/o Power)State Government should take steps to corporatize and unbundle the power department and allow it to run on sound economic principles.

 

Sikkim is fully mountainous and geologically young and hence its structure is extremely fragile. It is also in the seismic zone IV and susceptible to earthquakes and it is prone to flash floods and landslides during the monsoon which starts from May to mid-October. Climate Change is posing risk from potentially dangerous glacial lakes in Sikkim Himalaya. 

Sikkim faces the problem of high cost of infrastructure building and maintenance and compressed working season due to heavy rainfall.

The State faces difficulties in service delivery to a dispersed population living in hilly areas as the density of population is very low.

According to the State Government’s submissions:


	The FC-XIV projected the State GSDP based on a trend growth rate of 24.32% which was very high as compared to actual. It led to high calculation of OTR for the award period. Due to this, Sikkim became ineligible to get revenue deficit grants from the FC-XIV.
	Sikkim promotes organic farming and there is ban on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Hence, it has no longer remained eligible for any compensation from large fertilizer subsidies which is available to farmers of other States. Cost of production in organic farming is usually high and increase in yield and income of the farmers take time to get sustained. 
	TheState has suggested that farmers may be compensated in Sikkim for their eco-friendly initiative by making the State eligible for subsidy on fertilizers as revenue forgone. 
	Sikkim Government has recommended that the States’ share in overall divisible pool of taxes should be increased to 50%.


 


	Fund devolution should be made for all tiers of the local bodies.

	
		Fund requirement for RLBs-

		
			Projected requirement for both tiers of RLBs is Rs.1,356.8211 cores for 5 yrs
			Additional one time grant amounting to Rs 1100 crores requested for support of human resources and building of panchayat ghar.
		
		
		Fund requirement for ULBs
		
			Projected requirement of Rs.134.1163 crores  for 5 yrs
			Additional one time grant amounting to Rs 660 crores requested for basic infrastructure, ULB office, town halls and training institutes
		
		
	
	


The State has also asked for separate grants for Disaster Management.

Further, the State has also called for a “Peace Bonus” and a value of the amount of carbon sequestered by Sikkim’s forests.  The State has also made a state specific demands for big projects to create capital assets.  State has asked for a State Specific Grant of Rs. 26483 crore to bridge resource gap.

 

All inclusive the State has made a demand of Rs. 71623.97 crore to the 15th Finance Commission.

The meeting discussed in details all the State specific queries raised by the Chairman and Members.  The State was assured that all their issues would receive due attention of the Commission in its recommendations to the union government.                                                      

On the first day of its visit,  the Commission had a detailed meeting with the representatives of all the political parties in the State including Bhartiya Janta Party, Sikkim Pradesh Congress Committee, Sikkim Democratic Front and Sikkim Krantikari Morcha.   All the issues raised by the parties were noted by the Commission for addressing at the time of framing its recommendations.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials today met with the representatives of the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)  of  Sikkim.

The Commission was informed that:


	The Sikkim Municipalities Act 2007 was introduced in March 2007 for setting up of Urban Local Bodies in the state. The ULBs in the State were formed in the year 2010-11.
	Sikkim follows a three tier structure for urban local bodies namely Municipal Corporation, Municipal Council and Nagar Panchayats.
	Sikkim has a total of 7 ULBs, of which one is Municipal Corporation,  3 are Municipal Council and 3 are Nagar Panchayats.  
	Only 6 functions out of 18 have been transferred to ULBs. Steps should be taken to devolve the remaining functions to ULBs.
	The Fifth SFC of Sikkim submitted its report in July 2017.
	Projected requirement of Rs.134.1163 crores  for 5 yrs
	Additional one time grant amounting to Rs 660 crores requested for basic infrastructure, ULB office, town halls and training institutes


The revenue sources of ULBs provided by the State in 2017-18 are –


	
		
			
			Own revenues
			
			
			Transfers from 14th FC
			
			
			Devolution by SFC
			
			
			Grant-in-Aid from State Government
			
		
		
			
			8.59
			
			
			7.15
			
			
			2.94
			
			
			1.93
			
		
	


Some of  the issues of concern pertaining to accounting of ULB are –


	The State Government is yet to set up Property Tax Board as required by 13th FC for realisation of Property Tax despite enabling provision in the Sikkim Municipalities Act, 2007.
	Transfer of functions to ULBs have not yet been completed in full.         


 Meanwhile the recommendations of Fifth State Finance Commission were:


	4.5% of State’s own tax revenue 2020-2025 should be transferred to Local bodies.
	0.5% of net proceeds of State’s own tax revenue should be allocated for capacity building of PRIs and ULBs and
	0.5% of net proceeds of State’s own tax revenue should be allocated for special support to most backward PRIs and ULBs.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials met today with the representatives of the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) of Sikkim.  

 

          The Commission noted that the State has transferred all 29 functions listed in the 11th schedule of the Constitution to Rural Local Bodies.      

          Sikkim has a total of 189 PRIs, of which 185 are Gram Panchayats  and 4 are Zila Parishads.

          The revenue sources of PRI’s as informed by the State:

PRIs earn negligible revenues of their own. In 2017-18, they earned only 1.60 crores. The combined sources of revenues in 2017-18 are given below:

Sources of Revenues in 2017-18 (in Rs crores):


	
		
			
			Own revenues
			
			
			Transfers from GoI
			
			
			Transfers from 14th FC
			
			
			 Devolution by SFC
			
			
			Grant-in-Aid from State Government
			
		
		
			
			1.60
			
			
			90.00
			
			
			28.95
			
			
			22.32
			
			
			20.57
			
		
	


 

According to Pr. AG Sikkim, following are the issues pertaining to accounting of  PRIs –


	Transfer of functions to PRIs were not completed in full. (However, State Government has informed that they have devolved all functions to PRIs)
	New Accounting Format issued by Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Government of India in consultation with CAG was adopted since April 2010.  However, accounts were not maintained in New Accounting Format. System of certification has not been introduced in the State, as yet.


          Requirements of Panchayat Raj Institutions in Sikkim as highlighted to the Commission, include –


	RLBs in Sikkim earn no revenues on their own. State government may help the local bodies to use innovative methods like market fees, parking space etc for improving the own revenues.
	Property Tax Board has not been set up by State Government yet. This should be immediately set up to explore and enhance own revenues.

v Rajasthan State Industrial Development & Investment Corporation Ltd. (RIICO) and Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) have collaborated for facilitating Japanese investment in the State of Rajasthan during the period 2006-2016. 

 

v Rajasthan is the second largest crude oil producing state in India after Bombay High offshore field being operated by ONGC.   

 

v Tourism Potential in Rajasthan:

 

The state offers vast and unexploited potential for domestic tourists who, along with the foreign tourists, could contribute towards pushing the economic growth further, while providing employment opportunities.

o   According to the Tourism Statistics at a Glance 2018, State ranks 5th amongst all Indian States in attracting foreign tourists visits in the country in 2017. 6 percent of all Foreign Tourist visits were attracted by the State of Rajasthan in 2017.

 

o   State ranks 10th amongst all Indian States in attracting domestic tourists visits in the country in 2017. 2.8 percent of all Domestic Tourist Visits were attracted by the State of Rajasthan in 2017.

 

Positive Points:

 

v  Poverty: The State has made significant development in reducing the poverty, thereby showing its commitment towards SDG 1. The state has a poverty ratio of 14.7 in 2011-12 declining from 34.4 in 2004-05 (Population below Poverty Line Tendulkar Methodology).

v Education: According to ASER 2018 Report, (section on sports infrastructure in schools) Among the top states, almost half the schools in Rajasthan were seen to have dedicated physical education teacher, followed by Kerala, Bihar and Karnataka.

v In primary schools, student attendance improved by 3 percentage points or more over 2016 levels.

v Forest Cover: According to Forest Survey of India, the state has shown 2.48% increase in the forest cover in 2017 from 2015. This shows states commitment towards maintaining of ecological cover in the state.

 

 

v The state is taking ample steps to address the issues of low literacy and education levels like -

o    Appointment of 2 lakh new teachers

o    Development of model schools in each Panchayat,

o    ‘Panchayat Elementary Education Officer’ (PEEO) has been setup at Gram Panchayat level in charge of literacy for operation, monitoring and review of schemes,

o    Free bicycle distribution to girls, smart virtual classes etc.

 

v There has been substantial progress in development of Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) in State:

o   Budgeting is being done through Budget Module and Accounting through Treasury Module.

o   CAG/AG interface module and Online Reconciliation Module are under implementation process.

o   Integration of Local Bodies Accounting into IFMS to facilitate monitoring of utilization of funds by local bodies which is currently the weakest link in accounting of the State.

 

v Balanced Memorandum: The memorandum submitted by the State has given a balanced picture of both equity and efficiency indicators. The State has proposed various indicators for performance based indicators linked to The National Priority Programme like states effort in widening and deepening of GST Net, Efforts towards achievement of flagship schemes, sustainable development goals etc.

 

The issues of concern of the Finance Commission are:

 

v The state is exhibiting a rising trend in its Outstanding Debt to GSDP no’s. The Debt to GSDP ratio has increased from 23.87% in 2012-13 to 34.15% in 2017-18.

v UDAY: GoR had taken over 75 % of total debt amounting to  Rs. 62,422 crore during the period 2015-16 and 2016-17

v Double Digit Debt growth rate of government of Rajasthan for the past years violating the norms of fiscal prudence.

 

 

Rising gap between Revenue Receipts and Revenue Expenditure of the State-

v The state is experiencing an unsustainable trajectory in growth of revenue receipts and expenditure pattern where there is huge divergence observed in the revenue receipts growth and expenditure growth.

In the Power Sector, specifically on UDAY:

v The State has achieved 100 % progress in Feeder Metering, Rural feeder audit and reducing the ACS-ARR gap per unit.  GoR appears to have done all financial restructuring (loan, subsidy, equity) as per UDAY Scheme. However, the operational reforms and efficiency reforms are behind targets.

v State has not initiated metering of DTs in rural areas, poor performance is noted in feeder segregation.

v The State has not achieved target of reduction of AT&C loss to 15 % by 2018-19. 

v Out of 92.21 lakh total household as on July 2018, 71.82 lakh households (77%) have been electrified. Remaining 20.38 lakh (22.10) still remained un-electrified.

v There is a need for Improvement in power supplies and services with provision of 24 hours uninterrupted proper power supply to the rural domestic individual consumers

v Reducing the T&D loss and the Distribution Transformers (DT) failure rate should be a priority for the state Government.

v Wrong classification of consumers and Non-billing/delayed billing of consumer should be curtailed.

The Commission has noted that:

v    Though the Database formats of Third Tier bodies have been linked to the Model Accounting System and through this few reports/data such as annual receipts and payments, monthly reconciliations, consolidated abstracts register are being generated. However only few PRI’s do monthly reconciliations.

v    Following the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, orders on devolution were issued by the State Government in June 2003 and October 2010. Accordingly, out of 29 functions to be devolved in terms of XI Schedule of the Constitution, 23 functions were transferred. However, funds and functionaries were transferred in respect of 15 subjects only.

v    Dependency on grants and lack of fiscal autonomy is a matter of serious concern that needs to be addressed for improving governance at grass-root level.

 

Aspirational Districts

Special focus has to be made for improving the socio-economic development indicators of aspirational districts of Baran, Dhaulpur, Jaisalmer, Karauli and Sirohi.

 

Key Social Indicators- Rajasthan:

v    With an HDI Score of 0.577, Rajasthan is ranked 11th and is below the All-India score of 0.609. This indicates that efforts made towards improving social indicators have not been fruitful and there is an urgent need for course correction.

v    The states performance in key social indicators is adverse as compared to the National Average for key social indicators.

 

SDG INDEX – NITI AAYOG- 14th Rank

v   The state has a SDG Index value of 59, slightly higher the national average value of 57. The State ranks 14th amongst the Indian States.

v   State is a front runner in SDG-4- Quality Education, SDG-10-Reduced Inequality, SDG-15- Life on Land, SDG-16- Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. However, the state needs to improve on SDG-2 Zero Hunger, SGD -3 Good Health and Well Being SDG 5 Gender Equality SDG-6 Clean Water and Sanitation and SDG-11 sustainable cities and communities.

 

Inadequate Technical Skilled Population

v   According to Niti Aayog, Lack of technically qualified personnel in the state has been a concern.

v   The expected availability of skilled personnel is around 2.17 lakh less than half of the expected requirement in the state.

v   In case of Semi-skilled personnel, where the expected requirement is 30.91 lakh and the expected availability is around 10.91 lakh individuals.

 

 

 

Low Water Endowment and Severe Problem of Drinking Water-

v    The state comprises of only 1.1 percent surface water and 2. 5 percent of ground water resources. The per capita water availability in India is 1700 cubic meter per year, whereas, in Rajasthan, the availability is only 640 cubic meter per year.

v    The ground water condition in the State has become quite alarming due to overexploitation in the last two decades. Out of total 295 blocks in the State, only 52 blocks are safe, 191 over exploited, 11 critical, semi critical and 3 are saline.

v    34 Blocks have been identified by Central Ground Water Board as highly critical.

 

Inadequate Transport Infrastructure

 

v    Rajasthan still lags behind the national average with respect to road length.

v    The road density in Rajasthan is 74.3 km per 100 sq. km as against the national average of 143.1 km in the year 2016-17.

v    The total length of roads in the State is about 1,89,825 km in the year 2017-18. The length of national highways in the State is about 9,271 km while state highways extend to about 15,032 km.

 

7th Pay Commission

v    The state is reeling under the burden of 7th Pay Commission, there has been a substantial impact on salary and pension expenditure due to implementation of 7th Pay Commission with effect from 1st January 2016 and a large-scale creation of posts during the last 2 years.

v    The annual additional liability is around Rs. 10400 crore on account of salary and pension (Salary: Rs. 7124 crore: Pension: Rs. 3276 crore)

                15th Finance Commission held a meeting with economists in Jaipur on 8th September 2019, in coordination with the Government of Rajasthan and CUTS International. Many issues pertinent to fiscal devolution and issues specific to improving the economic growth of Rajasthan have been discussed in the meeting. The major points raised by the economists during the meeting include the following. 

(i) The deficit management of Governments is a matter that needs to be carefully handled with full recognition of contingent liabilities. At the same time, considering the investment requirements of the Indian economy, it is also important to ensure that future fiscal policy crowds in private investment.

(ii) Corrections attempted in the power distribution sector in terms of UDAY scheme affected the deficit position of the Government of Rajasthan considerably. Going forward, the assessment of the expenditure and revenue deficit of the State should take this into account. 

(iii) Water availability and distribution is one of the most important concerns for the State of Rajasthan. In Rajasthan, water supply at the village level is extremely expensive. This gives rise to concerns about sustainability of water supply programmes. 

(iv) Considering the above special issues concerning Rajasthan, future fiscal allocations may give special consideration to the difficulties in managing the cost of implementing programmes in deserts. Finance Commission may also think of making allocations that incentivise water use efficiency. 

(v) It is important to stay on course of the debt consolidation roadmap mandated by the States’ own Fiscal Responsibility legislations. 

(vi) It is important that the grants from the Union Government including through the window of Finance Commission may give enough scope for project level innovations at the State level and at the level of implementation agencies. 

(vii) At the macro level, the local government expenditure as percentage of total expenditure of the consolidated public sector is very low in India. This needs to be corrected. As responsible and accountable governments, it is important that local self-governments raise resources on their own and maintain their accounts properly. 

(viii) It is also important to create mechanisms to assess the impact of schemes implemented by governments at different levels.

 

A number of other issues relating to the Terms of Reference of the 15th Finance Commission were also discussed. 

The economists who were present at the interaction with Chairman Shri N. K. Singh and members of the Finance Commission include:- 

Shri Ambuj Kishore, Dr. Arvind Mayaram, IAS, (Retd), Mr. Atul Sharma, Mr. Basantt Khaitan, Prof. C.S.

                The Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh, the Members and officials of the 15th Finance Commission today held a detailed meeting with Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Union Minister for Food Processing Industries and senior officials of her Ministry.  The Minister presented an overview of the Food Processing sector to the Commission and its contribution to the economy.  She detailed the focus of the Ministry and outline the major policy initiatives.  The Finance Commission commended the fact that post 2015 a number of important initiatives have been taken up by the Ministry to improve the reach and quality of the Food Processing sector in India, which is walking towards minimizing waste, enhancing farm income and generating value-added activities.         

The Commission felt that it was of immediate value to complete the ‘Cold Chain Grid’ project of the Ministry and Value Added Infrastructure, which is now under way.  This grid could facilitate seedless Cold Chain Infrastructure from Farm to Fork and would require a grant of about Rs. 10 crore per project.  The Commission felt that these are critically dependent on simultaneous reforms in the agriculture sector, long-term contract farming, abolition of APMC and reducing the obtrusive reach of other connected regulations.

The Commission was also appreciative of the Ministry’s project “Operation Greens” which is an Integrated Value Chain development of Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) Crop and price stabilisation measures.  The Commission felt that it was a positive development that Tomato, Onion and Potato are out of the purview of outmoded  regulations.  The 15th Finance Commission is committed to favourable multipliers on form incomes, skill based employment activity and promoting  small and medium enterprises in this growing sector.

The Commission was also sympathetic to the Ministry’s suggestions that the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) and Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA)  wings of the Commerce Ministry should be under the Food Processing Ministry for better and effective management of agricultural and marine processed food exports.

                Recognition as a farmer by the Government through its PM KISAN scheme has played an important role in not only is ensuring income but also is giving confidence to every farmer across the country. Addressing the “3rd India Agricultural outlook forum 2019” with theme ‘Universal Basic Income for Farmers’ today, Secretary Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Sanjay Agarwal said that 85 million farmers have already registered for the scheme and an amount to the tune of US $ 3.5 billion has been transferred to about 65 million farmers in the first installment itself. The income support scheme had really supported the farmers as about 1.1 million farmers in the initial installment had less than Rs. 500 in their account and the amount of Rs. 2000 credited through PM KISAN was withdrawn on the day itself. Elaborating the Scheme to the gathering which consisted of representatives from World Organizations and foreign delegates the Secretary said that beneficiaries are being identified by the State Governments and it is 100% Central Sector scheme, providing an income support of Rs.6000/- per year provided to small and marginal farmer families. 

Highlighting several topics for the two day session, Shri Agarwal said that Artificial Intelligence and Big Data can play a great role in Agriculture Sector as the data is key to targeted development. Government is collating the data of its farmers through registration process for major Schemes, details of land holdings are getting digitized, insurance data, Soil Health Card data, KCC information data etc. which is further being utilized for understanding the actual status of farmer and his cultivation. He informed that recently a pilot project has been initiated in coordination with IBM’s Watson Decision Platform in 4 districts in the States of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh respectively to provide weather forecast and soil moisture information on pro bono basis at village level/ farm level to help farmers in taking decisions regarding water and crop management.

The Secretary said that the issue of food scarcity has been addressed through concerted efforts over the years and especially the pulses scarcity issue has been addressed through the steps taken in the last 3-4 years. This has been achieved with right information, reaching at right time to the framers and also access to required equipments. Now that the production has increased immensely in 2018-19, Government has started distributing pulses through the Public Distribution System with a focus to ensure nutrition security. 

In the Crop Insurance sector, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana now envisages use of improved technology like remote sensing imageries, Artificial Intelligence, Modeling tools to reduce time gap for settlement of claims. The PMFBY insurance cover is to the tune of about US $3.5 billion annually and covers nearly 20 million farmers. On the water management front Shri. Agarwal said that recently in a major programme by Government for the first time in history, the Prime Minister had given a task to 4000 officials to go to the districts and village level and to create awareness among the citizens on importance of water conservation and water management techniques.

Inaugurating the National Conference on Agriculture for Rabi Campaign 2019 Union Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shri Parshottam Rupala highlighted the record production achieved for food grains (285 million tonnes) and also complimented state governments for effective implementation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes. He said that this cooperation has made possible an all time high production of rice (116 million tonnes), wheat (102.5 million tonnes), pulses and oilseeds. He expressed concerned about the shortage of oilseeds for which he suggested launching a separate mission to increase capacity and reduce import of edible oils. The Minister emphasized that the demand for fertilizers should be made after consultation with farmer organizations at the District level. The State Agriculture Departments should furnish their fertilizer demands to Centre in time so that availability can be ensured to farmers at crucial stages of crops. He stressed taking advantage of favorable weather conditions so that better production can be achieved in the Rabi season. The State Agriculture Departments of Gujarat and Punjab should remain vigilant for locust attack as it has been reported in Rajasthan, he added. 

In his address, Secretary (AC&FW) Shri Sanjay Aggrawal informed that at the onset of monsoon ensuing Kharif season was slow but recorded an area of 1054 lakh hectare and it is expected that area coverage will surpass normal area. The department has decided to distribute seed mini-kits for Rabi crops, pulses and oilseed with active involvement of State Agriculture Departments. As far as Kisan Credit Card is concerned, major changes in terms of waiver of registration fee, minimum time for issuance of KCC, widening the range of loans etc have been made for covering large number of farmers. He said inputs have been received from State Agriculture Departments for modification in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and the scheme would be reviewed accordingly. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Rabi oilseed and pulses would be decided shortly.

Secretary (DARE) Shri Mahapatra informed that 45 biofortified varieties have been released with enhanced percentage of nutrients, protein etc. The State Agriculture Departments have been asked to provide support for strengthening the seed hubs. There is need to strengthen the Lab to Land connect for maximum benefit of farmers.

Secretary (Fertilizer) informed that a Fertilizer Awareness Drive will be organized by State Agriculture Departments on onset of Rabi season. The requirement for fertilizers needs to be generated at district level and needs to be forwarded to Centre by State Agriculture Departments. Buffer stock of fertilizers like urea would be explored at state level.

Presentations by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare were made on the subject of Credit, PMFBY, MSP operation, Farmers Welfare and Fertilizers. Three State Government presentations were also delivered and various components of flagship schemes were deliberated upon. Further, key implementation issues were discussed during the interactive sessions with state governments/UTs. 

The National Conference on Agriculture for Rabi Campaign 2019 was organized on 20.09.2019 at NASC, Pusa, New Delhi. The conference was inaugurated by Sh. Parshottam Rupala, Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. The Conference was graced by Secretary (AC&FW), Secretary (DARE), Secretary (Fertilizers) and senior officers from DAC&FW, DARE, ICAR & State Governments/UTs.

Thanking the farmers for bringing down the Stubble burning incidents, Shri Parshottam Rupala Union Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare requested further support and ideas from the farmers to ensure zero burning in all the villages. Inaugurating the National Conference on Crop Residue Management for the farmers from the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh & Delhi the Minister said that success stories from these States should be shared with all farmers.



The Minister expressed his immense pleasure after listening to the good experiences shared by farmers and requested them to sensitize other farmers about learning from the Conference. Several farmers shared experiences and suggestions during the Conference, more than 1000 farmers attended from the 4 states. 

Earlier, to support the efforts of the Governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi to address air pollution and to subsidize machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue through agriculture mechanization, a Central Sector Scheme for the period 2018-19 to 2019-20 has been implemented by Ministry in these States with a total outgo of Central funds Rs.1151.80 crores. 

During the year 2018-19, total funds of Rs. 584.33 crores were released to the State Governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and ICAR. All three State Governments have distributed 32,570 machines to the farmers on individual ownership basis and established 7,960 Custom Hiring Centres. 

This conference was organized in collaboration with ICAR in order to address concerns of farmers and State Governments. The straw burning events in 2018 have reduced by 15% and 41% as compared to that in 2017 and 2016 respectively, as per the report of the High Power Committee Chaired by Dr. Nagesh Singh. 



During the Conference, 20 farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were honoured for their valuable contribution in management of crop residue by using identified agricultural machinery, as well motivating other farmers of their village for in-situ management of crop residue to stop the straw burning. The Minister also launched a multilingual Mobile App “CHC Farm Machinery” for the farmers to avail the custom hiring services of CHCs located in the radius of 50 Kms. This app connects the farmers with Custom Hiring Service Centres in their area. This app can be downloaded on any android phone from Google Play Store.

                Highlighting the efforts of ICAR in scientific water management in line with the Jal Shakti Abhiyan Shri T. Mohapatra, DG ICAR and Secretary DARE said that measures like scheduling irrigation, constructive use of water, proper crop selection and utilising modern irrigation technologies are some major aspects which will enhance water security ensuring a high agricultural productivity. Shri Mohapatra added that after initiation of Jal Shakti Abhiyan by the Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, over 10.8 crore farmers have been trained through the Krishi Vigyan Kendras and 371 melas were conducted across the country from July 1st till date.



Detailing the benefits of several water conservation methods, Shri Mohapatra said that about 35-40% water could be saved and 20-25% reduction in fertilizer use could be ensured by scheduling of irrigation. Moisture sensors and automated irrigation systems which can be controlled by a farmer using mobile phone will help in deciding the time and amount of irrigation to be carried out. Constructive use of water, which includes use of recycled water and proper selection of crops, also helps in enhancing water security. Alternatives like cultivation of Fruits, Millets, Bajra and selection of proper varieties of crops also ensure constructive utilisation of water. Using Bio mulch and Hydro Gels which ensures slow release of water and utilising microbes that help in efficient absorption of water shall help in further ensuring reduced and proper utilisation of water in agriculture.

Explaining the objectives of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) Shri Mohapatra said that District Irrigation Plans has been prepared by the respective states based on the technical support from ICAR for implementation under PMKSY so that the slogan Har khet ko pani may be translated into reality. ICAR also contributed in preparing State Specific Action Plan for water sector for scientific assessment of the supply and demand side of water resources and vulnerability to climate change under National Water Mission. This will help to formulate annual State/UT Water Budgets and hence, allocation and efficient utilization of available water resources. 

Shri Mohapatra added that steps are being taken by Government in ensuring that the groundwater usage for irrigation is reduced. Water is the critical input of agriculture and about 80% of the current water use is drawn by agriculture. Out of 140 million ha of net sown area in the country, net irrigated area accounts about 68.38 million ha (48.8%) and remaining 51.2% is under rainfed. Out of the net irrigated area, about 40% is irrigated through canal systems and 60% is irrigated through groundwater. An important challenge facing the irrigation sector in India is the growing gap between Irrigation Potential Created (IPC) and Irrigation Potential Utilized (IPU), and uneven distribution of water over the length of the canal system. The overall irrigation efficiency of the major and medium irrigation projects is estimated to be around 38%. The efficiency of surface irrigation system can be improved from about 35-40% to around 50-60% and that of groundwater from about 65-70% to 72-75%. 

Shri Mohapatra added that low irrigation efficiency (35-40%), inequity in water distribution, mismatch between irrigation water supply and crop water demand, tail enders deprivation, irrigation induced salinity and waterlogging are some of the major challenges being faced in the canal commands. Similarly, in the groundwater irrigated command, indiscriminate withdrawal of groundwater has resulted in decline of groundwater table in North-Western and Southern regions. Contrary to this, the groundwater development in the Eastern region is sub-optimal. The stage of groundwater development in India is 63.3%. However, it is 166%, 140%, 137% and 120% in states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi, respectively, which has serious negative consequences. 

India with a geographical area of 328 M ha supports more than 18% of the world’s population, but has only 4.2% of freshwater resources. The country receives annual precipitation (including snowfall) of almost 4000 billion cubic meter (BCM), which results into estimated average water potential of 1869 BCM. Per capita annual water availability has declined from 5177 m3 in 1951 to 1508 m3 by 2014 and likely to reduce further to 1465 m3 and 1235 m3 by 2025 and 2050, respectively. The situation may further deteriorate, if anticipated impact of climate change on hydrology and water resources are also considered.

Congratulate PHD Chamber for gathering all the stakeholders of the Healthcare Industry on one platform through such conference, said that the sector is expected to generate 40 million jobs in India by 2020.

The health care industry in India has been one of the country’s largest economic sectors, with regard to both employment and revenue.

Indian healthcare sector, is expected to record a threefold rise, at a CAGR of 22 per cent during 2016-2022 to reach US$ 372 billion in 2022 from US$ 110 billion in 2016, the Minister said.

India ranks 145th among 195 countries in terms of quality and accessibility of healthcare. There is immense scope for enhancing healthcare services penetration in India, thus presenting ample opportunity for development of the healthcare industry.

Indian healthcare industry is one of the most knowledgeable and professional industry in the world.

The Minister said that this has been amply proved by the following facts:

We are one of the largest exporters of Pharmaceuticals.

The Indian healthcare Delivery as in the hospitals are one of the most efficient and cost-effective healthcare delivery systems due to our expert doctors and specialists and well-equipped diagnostics and nursing services.

Though we are dependent on imports in medical devices but Indian Medical Device manufacturers have now taken a lead and are producing high quality devices.

India is the only country with largest number of US-FDA compliant Pharma plants (more than 262 including APIs) outside of USA. We have nearly 1400 WHO-GMP approved Pharma Plants, 253 European Directorate of Quality Medicines (EDQM) approved plants with modern state of the art Technology. No other country can boast of such an infrastructure.

Indian pharmaceutical industry supplies over 50 per cent of global demand for various vaccines, 40 per cent of generic demand in the US and 25 per cent of all medicine in UK.

India accounts for 20 per cent of global exports in generics. India’s pharmaceutical exports stood at US$ 17.27 billion in 2017-18 and are expected to reach US$ 20 billion by 2020. In 2018-19 these exports are expected to cross US$ 19 billion.

Indian pharmaceutical sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15 per cent in the near future and medical device market expected to grow $50 billion by 2025. India is the second largest contributor of global biotech and pharmaceutical workforce. The pharmaceutical sector was valued at US$ 33 billion in 2017.

Indian pharmaceutical companies received record 300 generic drug approvals in USA during 2017 where the generic market is expected to reach US$ 88 billion by 2021.

By 2024-25, India’s biotech industry is estimated to increase to US$ 100 billion.

                Contract for coal gasification plant for urea project at the erstwhile Talcher unit of FCIL was awarded today.  The Minister of Chemicals & Fertilizers Shri Sadananda Gowda and the Minister for Petroleum Shri Dharmendra Pradhan presided over the contact Award Ceremony in New Delhi today. Both the leaders expressed happiness about the step that is being taken today and expected that the project would progress well.

Speaking on the occasion Shri Gowda said that it is heartening that the award is granted on this momentous day of VishwakarmaJayanti today.He hoped that this award on this auspicious day shall usher into making of New India.

The Minister said that India is an agriculture driven economy with a huge population which istouching 1.3 billion and counting. While this presents its own set of opportunities and strengths, feeding this huge population is an enormous task which our farmers are successfully doing for the past 70 years. For meeting the food requirements of the country, the role of fertilizers especially Urea in Indian context is paramount. Currently India imports about 50 to 70 lakh tones of urea every year to meet the urea requirement

Shri Gowda said that the Government is putting its earnest efforts to augment the availability of domestically produced urea and in this direction, efforts have started in the form of revival of closed FCIL and HFCL units at Sindri, Barauni, Ramagundam, Gorakhpur and Talcher.

Currently production of urea in the country is done by using pooled natural gas which comprises of domestic NG and imported LNG. Import of LNG is a costly affair and leads to spending valuable foreign exchange. Hence it is preferred that an indigenous raw material is used for production of urea and other fertilizers in the country. Talcher Fertilizer Project is a step in this direction wherein indigenous coal in a mix of petcoke shall be used for production of urea.

Talcher Fertilizers Limited (TFL) is implementing this Coal Gasification based Ammonia/Urea Project under Government's flagship program of revival of closed fertilizer units of Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited (FCIL). The project shall be the first operational Urea plant in Odisha and shall produce 1.27 MMTPA of Urea at an estimated investment of about Rs. 13000 Crore.

Coal gasification technology, which shall be deployed at TFL unit, is a state-of-the-art technology of M/s Air Products, USA and has been selected after following due shortlisting procedure. 

The project shall use a blend of coal and petcoke as feedstock for production of Fertilizer. Coal for this project shall be sourced from captive Northern part of North Arkhapal mine in Talcher region allotted to TFL. Petcoke shall be sourced from Paradip refinery for the project. This project shall promote use of abundantly available domestic coal in an environment friendly manner. Also, success of this technology shall also propel usage of coal for production of other products like, syngas, diesel, methanol, petrochemicals etc.

The project shall improve India's self-sufficiency in Urea, promote agriculture growth in Odisha and increase reliability of Urea availability to farmers of Odisha in particular and India in general. This initiative would propel India towards self-reliance in the Urea sector through efforts under ""Make in India"".

Rest of the world is quite ahead in Coal Gasification with more than 200 Coal Gasifiers being operational which are being used to produce Syngas (SNG), Ammonia/Urea, Methanol and various petrochemicals. Being environment­friendly, this project shall help meet the commitments made by India during CoP-21 Paris Agreement. This project has the potential to be a game changer in Indian context due to the harnessing of Coal through cleaner technologies in sectors other than power and shall produce 2.38 MMSCMD of Natural Gas equivalent Syngas leading to direct reduction in LNG import bill.

The project is expected for completion in 2023 and would generate direct and indirect employment of about 4,500.

This project of National Importance is in sync with the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi of ushering in a New India by 2022 and is thus a project worth showcasing. The project marks a watershed moment for India and also exemplifies the resolve and courage shown by the Central Government to tackle complex and challenging issues in order to find optimal, pragmatic and long - lasting solutions in the interest of India's future generations.

Department of Fertilizers is committed to do its utmost efforts to reduce the consumption of single use plastics.  As these are non biodegradable they pollute our environment.  An effective ban on single use plastic can happen if an alternative is available in the market.  Cloth/Jute bags, locally tailored and produced can be viable alternative.

 

Women’s self help groups can easily be trained for tailoring and marketing of such cloth bags.

 

Looking into such opportunities, Department of Fertilizers, during the Swachhata Pakhwada and Swachhata Hi Sewa campaign, decided to distribute cloth bags produced by Women’s Self help Group Sri Laxmi Devi Swasya Group of village Maragondanahalli Grama Panchayat Ramohalli District, Karnataka to its employees.

 



 

It is hoped that  the employees would not only use cloth bags for the daily use but will be enthused to take action towards reducing use of plastic and would focus plastic waste management in a big way.  At the same time, the local production by self-help groups would also contribute as  additional source of income to them.

 

It is a small step taken by Department of Fertilizers to reduce single use plastic usage and to make people aware of viable alternative while at the same time to improve the income and livelihood of rural women of India.

                Ministry of Civil aviation has undertaken many initiatives in the past 100 days in the direction of enabling affordable flying and healthy aviation sector growth. Some of the key initiatives are-

            India’s tallest Air Traffic Control tower was inaugurated earlier this month at the Indira Gandhi International Airport which will ensure up-scaled services and systems for efficient, smooth and uninterrupted air traffic management.

            The airports of Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Mangaluru have been awarded to a private concessionaire through Public Private Partnership (PPP) to bring efficiency in delivery, expertise, enterprise and professionalism apart from harnessing the needed investments in the public sector.

            ‘Aviation Jobs’ is a unique web-based portal launched by Ministry of Civil Aviation on 29.08.2019, which seeks to bring together job seekers and prospective employers in the Indian civil aviation sector. It is a common platform for enabling candidates to register their job interests across various sub-sectors. At the same time it facilitates sourcing of information about candidates available in the market by prospective employers with a view to improve prospects for employment or re-employment in the civil aviation ecosystem

            34 routes have been operationalized, awarded under round 1, 2 and 3 / Tourism RCS. These 34 RCS routes provide connectivity to 4 unserved (Jharsuguda, Mysore, Kolhapur and Jalgaon) and 4 underserved (Gwalior, Belgaum, Durgapur and Shillong) airports connecting 10 served (Raipur, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Goa, Kochi, Rajahmundry and Vizag) airports under the scheme.

As part of Digital initiatives the Ministry has taken up  


	eDGCA project conceptualized to completely automate the processes and functions of DGCA and its constituent directorates as well as to provide a strong base for IT infrastructure and service delivery framework. The work on development of various modules including licensing of pilots is under progress.
	DigiSky– an online portal to regulate the entire gamut of activities relating to governance and operation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS)/Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs)/drones has been made operational. While ensuring safety and security in drone operations, it will also help in promotion of drone technologies.
	 Esahaj-100% of security clearances pertaining to the Ministry have been made online on Esahaj online portal launched by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The portal is operational for granting clearances in respect of 24 categories.
	DigiYatra Trial for rollout of DigiYatra initiative has been started at Bangalore and Hyderabad airports. The initiative envisages seamless and hassle free passenger travel using biometric technologies to improve passenger experience, reduce queue waiting time as passengers can walk through e-gates by using advanced security solutions. It will remove redundancies at check points and enhance resource utilization.


            Passenger Service Fee (PSF) now called Aviation Security Fee (ASF) charged as part of passenger fare and collected by the airlines which is deposited in the escrow account of respective JVs or AAI account has been rationalized and a National Trust has been created to pool all the ASF collections across airports. The trust is to be managed by AAI. The collection of PSF(SC)/ASF in a single pool account will serve the purpose of cross subsidizing the smaller airports of AAI with low PSF(SC)/ASF collection thus bridging the funding gap.

            Recognizing India’s progress in resolving its safety oversight deficiencies and improving the Effective Implementation (EI), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has announced a Council President Certificate to India which would be presented during a special ceremony at ICAO headquarters, Montreal during the 40th Session of the Assembly.

                The seventh meeting of the UAE-India High Level Joint Task Force on Investments (the Task Force) was held on 22nd September 2019 in Abu Dhabi to review and maintain the significant progress made in enhancing bilateral trade and investment between the two countries.

The meeting was co-chaired by Sheikh Hamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Managing Director   of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Chairman of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince’s Court and Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry. Senior officials from both countries participated in the meeting.

The Task Force was established as a key forum to promote economic ties between the UAE and India. As the two countries implement the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in  January 2017 by Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Task Force has acquired new significance in promoting and facilitating investments between the two countries and in addressing mutual concerns. 

At the 7th meeting of the Task Force, the two sides expressed satisfaction at the progress made in mutually identified areas aimed at promoting bilateral trade and investments and took note of the successful outcomes of the recent visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to UAE.

Both sides also discussed issues relating to the tax treatment of the ADIA wholly owned subsidiaries at the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). The Indian side has agreed to give an early consideration and mutually beneficial solution to the issue in a way that could facilitate ADIA’s investments in India.

In the context of the Air Services Agreement between India and UAE and the memorandum of understanding, with the Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras-Al-Khaimah and Sharjah, both sides discussed the implementation of these bilateral agreements. They further agreed that pending issues, interests and concerns expressed by both sides be taken up for mutual benefit of the carriers and civil aviation sectors of the two countries. Both sides expressed their confidence in reaching mutually beneficial outcomes in the consultations that are planned to be held during the second half of October 2019.

 

The co-chairs noted the efforts to expedite the resolution of outstanding issues experienced by DP World in relating to expansion of its investment portfolio in India and agreed to resolve these issues to mutual satisfaction.

 

To increase the confidence of the business communities of the two countries, both sides stressed the importance of the bilateral judicial cooperation   through the recognition and enforceability of court judgement in civil and commercial cases and arbitration awards in each other’s country.

 

Areas for future cooperation were also discussed at the meeting, including growth opportunities for Indian banks, asset managers and technology companies at ADGM, and the potential for private banks operating at ADGM to offer high quality private wealth services in India. In this regard, the UAE side further emphasized the strategic role that ADGM has played in fostering collaborations to enable sustainable trade flows and investments between the two economies.

 

The co-chairs appreciated the functioning of ‘UAE PLUS’ special desk and the ‘Fast Track Mechanism’ established at the 6th HLTFI to facilitate investments and resolve issues relating to UAE Investments into India.

 

The two sides reviewed and expressed satisfaction on a number of significant achievements and areas of progress made by the Task Force since its creation in 2012, including (i) the signing of a bilateral agreement for the promotion and protection of investments, which is now being renegotiated as a 

Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) (ii) the UAE’s contribution to India’s strategic petroleum reserve, (iii) ADIA’s participation in India’s National Infrastructure Investment Fund as the first foreign 

institutional investor and (iv) the positive progress being made in addressing the clubbing issue of UAE investment entities for the purpose of the foreign investment limit in Indian listed companies. 

Sheikh Hamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince’s Court and Co-chair of the Task Force, expressed his appreciation for the positive role the Indian community has played in the UAE across various areas, which demonstrates the depth of friendship, trust and cooperation that has developed between both countries.

Commenting on the seventh meeting of the Task Force, Sheikh Hamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, said that the activities of the UAE-India Joint Task Force have and will continue to play an important role in promoting bilateral investment and supporting our countries’ growth ambitions. By providing a platform to strengthen the dialogue between our countries, we have emerged with a deeper understanding of each other’s key goals and objectives, which has led to progress in a number of key areas. Bilateral trade and investment between the UAE and India is growing at an encouraging rate. Through the initiatives we discussed today, and others, we are confident this growth will continue.

Piyush Goyal added that UAE-India High Level Joint Task Force on Investments is an important pillar of our deep economic relations. It is a platform to communicate our mutual requirements and vision for the future, and has helped boost bilateral investments and cooperation. UAE is one of the largest investors in India and one of our most important trading partners, and will also help India in our goal of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy. In this context, he further added that the discussions will go a long way in promoting ease of doing business and investments in both our countries, which will help in economic growth and development of our people.

                The 16th Session of the Joint Economic Commission (JEC) between India and Belgium Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) was convened in New Delhi on 17th September, 2019. The Session was co-chaired by Anup Wadhawan, Commerce Secretary with Ms. Sylvie Lucas, Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg.

The session was attended by officials of Department of Commerce and Promotion of Industry & Industrial Trade, Ministry of AYUSH, New & Renewable Energy, External Affairs, Information and Broadcasting and Railways. The delegation from Belgium was led by Ms. Anick Van Calster, Director General for Bilateral Affairs, Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation.

India and BLEU side reiterated the importance of the JEC towards the development of bilateral economic and trade relations through facilitating dialogue and enhancing cooperation on a wide range of issues of mutual interest, such as, transportation and logistics, renewable energy, aerospace and satellites, audio and visual industry, agro and food processing industry, life sciences, ICT, traditional medicine, Ayurveda and yoga, and tourism. The India and BLEU sides resolved that dynamic nature of commercial exchanges seen in the last few years is reflected in the increasing number of companies interested in establishing and gaining access to respective markets, and signing of MoU among the three Countries for cooperation in multiple fields of mutual interest.

 JEC Sessions are convened based on an agreement signed in 1990 in New Delhi. This biennial event is organized in capital cities of the three countries alternatively, and is a main vehicle for discussing economic and commercial issues between India and BLEU.  

The bilateral trade between India-Belgium and India-Luxembourg in year 2018-19 was USD 17.2 billion and USD 161.98 million, respectively, registering growth of 41% and 150%, as compared to 2017-18. Cumulative FDI inflows to India from Belgium and Luxembourg during April, 2000 to June, 2019 were around USD 1.87 billion and USD 2.84 billion, respectively. While economic exchanges between India and BLEU remain satisfactory, they nevertheless still offer ample opportunities for further intensification and diversification in mutually beneficial areas and their complementarities.

Joint Economic Commission between India and Belgium - Luxembourg Economic Union (India-BLEU) was established in 1997 and is the main vehicle for discussing bilateral economic and commercial issues. 

The focus of bilateral relations has been on trade and investment. India is Belgium’s second largest export destination and fourth largest trade partner outside the European Union with a significant contribution from the Indian diaspora.

The leading exports from Belgium to India are in the sectors of gem and jewellery (rough diamonds) chemical and chemical products and machinery and mechanical products. The major exports from India to Belgium are in the sectors of gem and jewellery (finished products), base metals and articles and chemicals and chemical products. 

There are around 160 Belgian companies in India. Several Indian companies particularly in the IT and software sectors like TCS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL have established base in Belgium to cater to the Belgian and European markets.

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal gave way the export awards of CAPEXIL in New Delhi today. Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Pratap Chandra Sarangi was also present at the award function.

Speaking on this occasion Commerce and Industry Minister said that in the chemicals and allied sectors, which has some of the oldest industries in the country, has much more potential than has been tapped and it is time that the entire sector should make a combined effort to take up new challenges, set higher goals and aspire for extraordinary results. 

Commerce and Industry Minister complimented the award winners and said that they must inspire others, who have not won an award today, to take bold decisions and risks and aspire to do extraordinary work in their industry. For this, the Minister added that the CAPEXILsector industries must embrace new technology and explore new markets, make value addition to the products that are being manufactured and not just remain in their comfort zone as manufactures and exporters of raw and basic products.

Piyush Goyal further said that although India’s exports of the chemicals and allied sectors amount to 10 % of the global chemical market, it is time now to aspire to be the number one exporter of products from this sector and for this the Commerce and Industry Minister urged all the industries of this sector to think of ways and means to make more value addition to their products in the export basket and be bold and nimble footed. 

Commerce and Industry Minister added that it is in the MSME sector that the future of India lies and urged industries of the MSME sector to demand the support of the Government in development of clusters near ports, availability of land in bulk, common effluent treatment plants and common testing facilities. Piyush Goyal further said that investing and caring for the environment is an advantageous proposition for everybody, the industry as well as citizens, as it helps tocreate a conducive business climate and acceptability for Indian products worldwide. 

Commerce and Industry Minister urged industry to engage with the world, grasp all opportunities that are available through the free trade agreements that India has entered into with other countries but at the same time protect the national interest, their business interests and above all the interest of the consumers.

                Recognising the importance of nurturing innovation and creativity in a knowledge economy, India is taking great strides in strengthening its intellectual property ecosystem.

Further, given the key role played by MSMEs in the economic growth of India, it is proposed to reduce the fees for various IPRs as follows:

			ACTIVITY
			
			
			CATEGORY
			
			
			CURRENT FEES
			
			
			PROPOSED FEES
			
			
			REDUCTION (%)

			NIL

Fees structure is for e-filing/ physical filing. Draft Rules for amendment in GI Rules have been notified.

National IPR Policy adopted by the Government in 2016 has paved the way to further strengthen the IPR regime in the country. Already, the concrete steps undertaken in the past 5 years have seen IP filings rise:


	
		
			
			Filing of IP applications
			
			
			Increase from 2013-14 to 2018-19 (%)
			
		
		
			
			Patents
			
			
			18
			
		
		
			
			Trademarks
			
			
			69
			
		
	


 

Domestic filing for patents has increased from 22% in 2013-14 to 34% in 2018-19. Awareness programmes for IP are being conducted at schools, colleges, universities, R&D institutes and industry clusters. Multi-pronged strategies have been used to address the issue of pendency in IP applications, including manifold augmentation of manpower and streamlining of procedures. These strategies have paid rich dividends, and there has been a sharp jump in the disposal of IP applications:


	
		
			
			Disposal of IPR applications 
			
			
			Increase from 2013-14 to 2018-19 (%)
			
		
		
			
			Patents
			
			
			353
			
		
		
			
			Trademarks
			
			
			395

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal informed about the details of the Export Credit Insurance Scheme (ECIS) in New Delhi today at a press conference. Minister of State for Commerce & Industry, Hardeep Singh Puri was also present. The scheme was announced by the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, as part of measures to boost exports, on 14th September 2019 in New Delhi. 

Due to the global slowdown and rising NPAs, banks are in stress and therefore require additional support. Finance Ministry has taken steps towards merger of Banks and has infused additional capital to the banks. In order to facilitate banks further Ministry of Commerce & Industry has enhanced Insurance cover for Banks up to 90% for the working capital loans and moderation in premium incidence for the MSME sector.

Enhanced cover will ensure that Foreign and Rupee export credit interest rates will be below 4% and 8% respectively for exporters.

The stimulus package will catalyze Banks to enhance volume of export credit lending particularly to the MSME Sector with optimal pricing due to capital and risk optimization.

The existing covers issued by Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (ECGC) will continue for the existing customer banks and similar covers will also be made available to all other banks. All standard accounts covered under ECGC as on the date of transition, shall be eligible for cover under the ECIS.

The scope of cover has been enlarged to cover not only the principal outstanding but also for the unpaid Interest (for a maximum of two quarters or the NPA date, whichever is earlier).

The cover percentage has been enhanced to 90% from the present average of 60% for both Principal and Interest.

A single cover document for ECIS shall be issued covering both the Pre-shipment and Post-shipment advances unlike the present two different documents being issued by ECGC.

The scheme envisages simplified procedure for settlement of claim and also for provisional payment up to 50% within 30 days on production of proof of end-use of the advances in default by the Insured Bank.

The ECIS support shall be in force for a period of 5-years and on conclusion, the standard ECGC covers will be available for Banks with its regular features.

For accounts with limits below Rs.80 crore the premium rates will be moderated to 0.60 per annum and for those exceeding Rs.80 crore, it will be 0.72 per annum for the same enhanced cover.

Banks shall pay premium to ECGC on monthly basis on the Principal and Interest as the cover is offered for both outstandings. 

Under the scheme, inspection of bank documents and records by ECGC officials shall be mandatory for losses exceeding Rs.10 crore as against the present Rs.1crore.

Other procedural aspects such as reporting or seeking approval of limits, monthly declarations with premium, extension in due date under Pre-Shipment/Post-Shipment, Report of Default, Lodgment of Claim, placing of borrower in Specific Approval List (SAL), Sharing of recovery, Checking of Buyers Specific Approval List (BSAL) and Checking of Restricted Cover Category (RCC) Country shall continue as per the existing terms and conditions of cover of ECGC.

Banks shall continue to adhere to the RBI and their internal guidelines relating to export finance backed by enhanced due diligence on the borrower. 

The proposed cover will bring down the cost of credit due to capital relief, less provision requirement and liquidity due to quick settlement of claims and will ensure timely and adequate working capital to the export sector. 

ECGC is a fully Government of India owned company established in the year 1957 to promote exports by providing credit insurance services. ECGC provides Export Credit Insurance to Banks (ECIB) to protect the Banks from losses on account of export credit at the Pre and Post-Shipment stage given to exporters due to the risks of insolvency and/or protracted default of the exporter borrower.

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce & Industry, Hardeep Singh Puri, launched Common Digital Platform for Issuance of electronic Certificates of Origin (CoO) in New Delhi today. 

 

This platform will be a single access point for all exporters, for all FTAs/PTAs and for all agencies concerned. Certificate of Origin will be issued electronically which can be in paperless format if agreed to by the partner countries. Authorities of partner countries will be able to verify the authenticity of certificates from the website. Further, it provides administrative access to Department of Commerce for reporting and monitoring purposes. The benefits of this platform will be:


	
		
			
			New Platform
			
			
			Existing Process
			
		
		
			
			The issuance process is electronic, paperless and transparent
			
			
			Current process requires the exporter to visit the agency thrice for each certificate
			
		
		
			
			Real-time tracking of FTA utilization at product level, country level etc.
			
			
			Real-time tracking is not possible as data is fragmented across various agencies
			
		
		
			
			Electronic Certificate of Origin issued
			
			
			Physical Certificates of Origin issued
			
		
		
			
			Possible to electronically exchange CoO with the partner countries
			
			
			Electronic exchange of CoOs not possible
			
		
		
			
			Reduces transaction cost and time for the exporters
			
			
			Current processes take more time and cost
			
		
	


 

Exporters may register on this platform and apply for CoOs to any of the designated agencies. EIC and its agencies are already on-boarded. Other agencies are in the process of registering on the platform. The on-boarding process is only for the purposes for payment integration so that the application fees may flow to the respective agencies.

The platform will be made live for FTAs in a phased manner as per the concurrence of the concerned partner countries. Various territorial divisions have already informed their partner countries. We are scheduled to start with the India-Chile PTA.

Further, once the partner countries agree to an electronic data exchange, the CoOs will be electronically sent to the Customs of the partner countries. After this, there will not be any need for physical CoO copy, saving transaction cost and time for the Indian exporters.

India has 15 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)/ Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) with various partner countries under which Indian exporters avail reduced import tariffs in the destination country.  In order to avail this benefit, the exporters must provide a preferential CoO. About 7 lakh certificates are issued annually by designated agencies. These verticals certify that exported goods are made in India. These certificates are issued by designated agencies in India after vetting of the rules of origin criteria as per the respective FTA/PTA. Some designated agencies for CoO issuance are EIC, Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Textile Committee and Tobacco Board. 

 

At present preferential Certificate of Origin is issued from the various notified agencies around the country through manual processes. A new common digital platform for issuance of electronic preferential CoOs has been conceptualized to address various challenges in the current process. The platform has been designed and developed by DGFT and Regional & Multilateral Trade Relations (RMTR) Division, Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India.

                The Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways, Piyush Goyal, chaired a meeting of the Board of Trade (BoT) and held a day-long interaction with the Industry and Agriculture Ministers and officials of various States, industry representatives, Export Promotion Councils and officers of the economic and infrastructure Ministries of the Central Government for identifying and addressing issues aimed at boosting exports and improving competitiveness of domestic manufacturing. 

The Minister addressed the gathering and noted that significant progress has been made since the last Board of Trade meeting held on 6 June 2019, and an action taken report in the matter has been shared with stakeholders. 

In the area of export credit, including forex credit, especially with regard to credit at affordable terms and in sufficient volume, Piyush Goyal informed that the contours of a scheme will be soon shared by the Government. In addition, he informed that ECGC procedures and practices are being revamped to make them more exporter friendly. He also assured that issues raised by States will be resolved expeditiously. 

The Commerce and Industry Minister also stressed the importance of cooperative and competitive federalism for faster growth and the need for transforming each district into an export hub to fulfil the vision of Prime Minister to make India a USD 5 trillion economy within the next five years. He emphasized the need to prioritize the area of addressing key issues related to imports, including unfair competition through dumping and subsidies, and import of sub-standard products due to lack of standards, while enabling smooth import of key inputs and raw materials. 

During the day-long deliberations, Export Promotion Council and other Industry bodies raised the issue of transparency in risky exporters by Customs/GST authorities, GST refunds, declining export credit, requirement of collaterals and inverted duty structure. 

Various States also participated in the discussions and raised the matter of special packages for automobile, textiles, diamonds and fisheries as these sectors are facing problems leading to loss of employment. 

Issue of extension of sunset clause in respect of SEZs, technology park for ancillary industries in defence sector, and promotion of border trade from North Eastern States were also discussed. Deliberations were also carried out with regard to utilising opportunities in Free Trade Agreements, addressing key regulatory concerns related to imports. Specific action points for expediting IGST refunds, timely disbursal of export incentives, reducing logistics costs, improving ease of doing business in all States, increasing domestic manufacturing and reducing inessential imports were identified. 

While noting that many States have finalized export strategies since the last BoT meeting, the remaining States were urged to finalise their export strategies at the earliest keeping in view their state specific requirements and advantages. It was also suggested that a State level senior officer may be appointed exclusively as Trade Facilitation Commissioner in each State to look into trade and export facilitation. 

Minister of State (Independent Charge) Housing and Urban Affairs and Civil Aviation and Minister of State, Commerce & Industry,Hardeep Singh Puri, and Minister of State for Commerce & Industry,SomParkash, also participated in the deliberations. Amitabh Kant, CEO NITI Ayog, AnupWadhawan, Commerce Secretary GuruprasadMohapatra, Secretary DPIIT were also present during the conference.

                The Press Note No. 17 (1984) series regarding Environmental clearance of Industrial Licence- conditions of Letter of Intent/Industrial Licence, relates to pre-1991 period.

i. Cigars and Cigarettes of tobacco and manufactured tobacco substitutes

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal and Ministers of State of Commerce and Industry, Hardeep Singh Puri and SomParkash addressed the 2nd meeting of theBoard of Trade in New Delhi today.

The Board of Trade and Council for Trade Development and Promotion have been merged into the Board of Trade and representatives of both bodies were present in today’s interactive meeting. 

Addressing the participants Minister of Commerce & Industry, Piyush Goyal said that each district of India has the potential equal to that of a country with its own distinct handicraft and unique specialties like saris, perfumes, sweets and utensils which has the potential for exports. There is a need for transforming each district of India into anexport hub. Commerce and Industry Minister urged his colleagues from States to identify and take measures to realize this by incorporating it into its export strategy. 

Commerce & Industry Minister further said that the merger of banks will now enable them to disburse enhanced credit, raise their risk appetite and to raise resources from the market. He further added that Rs 70,000 crore will be released to PSBs upfront and additional lending and liquidity to the tune of Rs 5 lakh crorethat will benefit corporate, retail borrowers, MSMEs, small traders and exporters. 

All pending GST refunds due to MSMEs will be paid within 30 days and improved One Time Settlement policy will benefit MSMEs and retail borrowers in settling their overdue, added the Minister.

In his opening remarks Piyush Goyal listed out the many initiatives that have been taken to digitisethe interaction with exporters like e-issue of importer-exporter’s code, paperless MEIS, paperless Advance and EPCG Authorizations and online RCMC for exporters. Thereorganization of DGFT field offices have led to better utilization of human resources.

Piyush Goyal said that although total exports of India have crossed half trillion-dollar mark at USD 537 billion in 2018-19, goods exports are at an all-time high of USD 331 billion and services exports stand at a record USD 205 billion but India will have to achieve one trillion USD of exports in the next five years. For this, the Minister said that we need to increase domestic production and improve our competitiveness. 

Simultaneously, both Central and State Governments, together have to take measures for further improving ease of doing business, decrease logistics cost, simplify regulatory procedures. It is a matter of pride that our rank in ease of doing business has improved from 142 in 2014 to 77 in 2018 with trading across borders up from 122 to 80. However, we have to break into top 50 nations and we have to improve ease of doing business throughout the country and the States have to play a major role in this. 

The Commerce and Industry Minister announced that the Ministry will soon be coming out with a credit scheme for exporters with enhanced insurance cover upto 90% instead of the present 60%. 

Piyush Goyal said that there has not been much growth in exports this year and it is not satisfactory as India has a huge potential for exports due to the trade dispute between US and China which has provided a window of opportunity to Indian manufacturers for taking up exports of products to US or China where the higher tariffs have been imposed on imports from the other country. We have a trade surplus of USD 17 billion with USA while we have a trade deficit of USD 53 billion with China, added the Minister and for this India needs to work on its strengths by exploring market access for agriculture and pharma products in different regions. 

Commerce and Industry Minister hoped that the day-long session will help in identifying undesirable imports and help in the formulation of guidelines for the foreign trade policy which is being formulated to make it more robust. 

During the inaugural session the LEADS Index - 2019 was released by Commerce and Industry Minister along with Ministers of State for Commerce and Industry,Hardeep Singh Puri and SomParkash, CEO NITIAayog, Amitabh Kant, Commerce Secretary,AnupWadhawan, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade Secretary, GuruprasadMohapatraand Director General of Foreign Trade,AlokVardhanChaturvedi.

The top ranking state in the logistics sector is Gujarat followed by Punjab and Andhra Pradesh. Among the hilly Eastern States Tripura is the top performer and among Union Territories (UTs) Chandigarh was selected as the best performing UT.

The LEADS Index is an effort by the Commerce and Industry Ministry to establish the base line of performance in the logistics sector based on the perception of users and stakeholders at the State level. It provides the basis for stakeholder engagement, discussions and evolving action plan by various agencies. It is not an index of the performance of the State Government but may be used to assess the status of logistics efficiency in each State. 

The State Logistics Performance Index is arrived at using a ranking methodology based on a series of meetings with stakeholders and online surveys in the key areas of the logistics like infrastructure, services, timelines, traceability, competitiveness, security, operating environment and efficiency of regulation.

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal, held a meeting with around 100 domestic industry, manufacturers, associations of various sectors and users today in New Delhi to discuss and provide a holistic view about regulatory instruments for the formulation and implementation of effective trade policy and development strategy. Senior officials of various Ministries and Departments of Central Government also participated in the meeting. Ministers of State for Commerce & Industry, Hardeep Singh Puri and SomParkash were also present during the meeting.

Commerce & Industry Minister, Piyush Goyal, in his address,said that tariff & non-tariff measures will be used judiciously by India with an  ultimate aim to enable industry to become more competitive. Piyush Goyal said that Departments of Commerce & DPIIT are there to balance interests of domestic consumers and industry. He said that DGTR office is being strengthened with more man power who will be properly trained to perform their duties effectively. Regarding corruption issues that are delaying consignments,the Minister requested exporters to write directly to Secretaries of line ministries or to Commerce & Industry Ministry as Government of India is committed to ensuring a corruption free environment in each and every Ministry and Department of the Government.

Additional Secretary and DG Trade Remedies said that the helpdesk in Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has been upgraded to a facilitation centre to create awareness regarding trade remedies and to provide full support to the industry, particularly nascent domestic producers and MSMEs. Help line number is 1800 111 808 and Email: helpdesk.dgtr[at]gov[dot]in

The objectivesof the meeting were awareness generation about regulatory instruments amongst the stake-holders, to provide a platform where issues faced by the domestic industry may be appropriately addressed andcalibrate trade policy to balance domestic industry interests, including protection against unfair trade practices with imperatives of consumer interest, efficiency and competitiveness. The meeting focused on the prudent use of all available Trade Policy Instruments, viz. Tariff Measures, Non-Tariff Measures as well as Trade Remedial Measures for the Indian industry. 

Detaileddiscussions were held on the ease of goods movement and competitiveness which are necessary for India to integrate with global value chains. Piyush Goyal stressed on the need to ensure secure and vibrant manufacturing in strategic sectors, and the necessity to include domestic stakeholders in trade policy-making process, along with policy and institutional coordination amongst stakeholders and the Government. 

Today’s meeting stressed on a systematic understanding of trade policy instruments, especially non-tariff measures, to ensure that limited resources are channelized for achieving economic development. Further, the meeting discussed the policies adopted by other countries. In this context, it was noted that other countries, especially the developed ones resort more to non-tariff measures than tariff measures.

The rate of growth of merchandise imports during 2018-19 over 2017-18, was higher than that of exports over the same period, which underscores the need to increase exports at a much higher rate. This is possible only if Indian industry is globally competitive.

Senior officers from ministries of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Coal, Food & Public Distribution, Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare, Mines, Textiles, New and Renewable Energy, Civil Aviation, Electronics & Information Technology, Steel, Shipping, Health and Family Welfare, Food Processing Industries, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Departments of Telecommunications, Fertilizers, Heavy Industries, Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Chemicals & Petrochemicals, Pharmaceuticals, Animal Husbandry & Dairying and Fisheries also attended the meeting.

                Economic Ministers from ten ASEAN Member States and the Minister of Commerce and Industry of the Republic of India (“the Ministers”) met on 10 September 2019 at Bangkok in Thailand for the sixteenth AEM-India Consultations. The Consultations were co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce, Thailand, Jurin Laksanawisit and Minister of Railways and Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal.

The Ministers noted that, based on preliminary ASEAN data, two-way merchandise trade between ASEAN and India grew by 9.8 per cent from USD 73.6 billion in 2017 to USD 80.8 billion in 2018. The Ministers were also pleased to note the recovery of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows from India in 2018, amounting to USD 1.7 billion. This placed India as ASEAN’s sixth largest trading partner and sixth largest source of FDI among ASEAN Dialogue Partners. According to India’s preliminary data, FDI inflows into India from ASEAN in 2018 was USD 16.41 billion, approximately 36.98 per cent of total FDI flow into India. 

The Ministers were pleased to note the ratification of the ASEAN-India Trade in Services Agreement by all Parties in 2018. The Ministers also noted the on-going efforts for the ratification of the ASEAN-India Investment Agreement and looked forward to the full ratification by all Parties as soon as possible. The Ministers agreed to initiate the review of the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) to make the AIFTA more user-friendly, simple, and trade facilitative for businesses and to constitute a Joint Committee, as provided in Article 17 of the AITIGA, for this purpose. The Ministers tasked officials to work on the details of the review and submit an update at the 17th AEM-India Consultations. 

 

The Ministers commended the outcomes of the 4th India-ASEAN Expo and Summit held on 21-23 February 2019 in New Delhi, India. The Ministers noted that the event provided an ideal platform for investors, business leaders, industry captains and policy makers to enhance their engagements in further facilitating mutual trade and investment. In this regard, the ASEAN Economic Ministers encouraged for the promotion of this event to business communities in ASEAN as an effective platform for discussions, exchange of ideas, and buyer-seller matching. 

The Ministers welcomed the recommendations of the ASEAN-India Business Council to further promote the potential of bilateral trade through the utilisation of ASEAN-India FTA  as well as cooperation in some areas of mutual interest such as financial technology (FinTech), connectivity, start-ups, and innovation, empowerment of youth and women, and MSMEs development. The Ministers also expressed their support for the Fourth ASEAN-India Business Summit and Business Excellence Award, which will be held in Manila in October 2019.

                As part of Prime Minister’s call to action for Plastic Waste Management, during his Independence Day speech, the theme of this year’s Swachhta hi Sewa is Plastic Waste Management. Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce & Industry, is playing a critical two-fold role for the success of the campaign as mandated by Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti.

First, DPIIT will ensure recycling of plastic waste collected on 2nd October 2019 in cement kilns and second, collect plastic waste through nationwide shramdaan on 2nd October 2019. For this DPIIT has requested all the State Governments and Union Territories to mobilise the Industrial Parks in States and Union Territories for collection of plastic waste across all Industrial Estates, Parks, Corridors, Nodes and Industrial Areas for the Swachhta hi Sewa 2019 campaign beginning from 11th September, 2019.

The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, has requested DPIIT to mandate the use of plastic waste by cement kilns and DPIIT will ensure that all collected plastic waste may be recycled in cement kilns by Diwali this year.

On 2nd October, for the Swachhta hi Sewa campaign this year, DPIIT personnel will undertake Shramdaan and ensure the collection of plastic waste on and around industrial areas all across the country.

DPIIT has requested State Governments to sensitize Industrial Parks by focusing on Plastic Waste Management on a sustained and continuous basis. State and Union Territory Governments will monitor the campaign through their nodal teams to be set up by them.

The Ministers from the 16 RCEP Participating Countries (RPCs) gathered in Bangkok on 8 September 2019 for the 7th RCEP Ministerial Meeting to review developments in the RCEP negotiations since the Ministers last met in Beijing on 2-3 August 2019. The Meeting was chaired by Jurin Laksanawisit, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce of Thailand.

The Ministers recognised that negotiations have reached a critical milestone as the deadline for the conclusion of negotiations draws near. Notwithstanding the remaining challenges in the negotiations, RPCs are working on addressing outstanding issues that are fundamental to conclude the agreement this year as mandated by the Leaders.

Continuing uncertainties in trade and investment environment have dampened growth outlook across the world, with likely impact on businesses and jobs, adding to the urgency and imperative of concluding the RCEP. While noting that certain developments in the global trade environment may affect RPC’s individual positions in the course of the negotiations, Ministers agreed that RPCs should not lose the long-term vision of deepening and expanding the values chains in the RCEP. The Ministers underscored that, successfully concluded, the RCEP will provide the much-needed stability and certainty to the market, which will in turn boost trade and investment in the region. To this end, Ministers reaffirmed their collective resolve to bring negotiations to a conclusion.

The Ministers committed to avail negotiators with the necessary resources and mandate to bring negotiations to a close. The Ministers made the collective call to negotiators at all levels to translate this commitment into constructive actions and positive outcomes.

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal, will attend the 7th RCEP Ministerial Meeting, 16th ASEAN India Economic Ministers (AEM) meeting and the 7th East Asia Economic Ministers Summit being held in Bangkok from 8-10 September 2019.  The meetings will be   attended by Economic Ministers and senior leaders of ten ASEAN member countries and eight East Asia Summit (EAS) countries. 

 Engagement with ASEAN is at the core of India’s ‘Act East’ policy. ASEAN is the gateway to the Indian Ocean region and as close partners, there is convergence of views in India’s and ASEAN outlook in the region. 

Trade and investment relations between India and ASEAN continue to show remarkable growth. India’s bilateral trade jumped threefold from USD 21 billion in 2005-06 to USD 96.7 billion in 2018-19.  ASEAN countries together have emerged as the largest trading partner of India in 2018-19 (followed by USA), with a share of 11.47 % in India’s overall trade, while India was ASEAN’s sixth largest trading partner in 2018. 

Investment flows are also substantial both ways.   The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows into India from ASEAN between April 2018 to March 2019 was about USD 16.41 billion which is approximately 36.98 % of total FDI flow into India. FDI inflows from India to ASEAN in 20018 amounted to USD 1.7 billion, placing India as ASEAN’s sixth largest source of FDI.  

The EAS meeting will discuss regional and global economic developments and ASEAN’s outlook on the Indo-Pacific regions. Matters related to promotion of trade and investment among the partner countries will also be discussed in the India ASEAN AEM and EAS-EMM meetings.

Piyush Goyal is also scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from Japan, Singapore, China, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, Thailand and Russia.

                Smart Cities Mission, in partnership with Invest India and the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India organized the Smart Cities Mission Technology Showcase in Pune. Pune Smart City Development Corporation Ltd. was the host smart city for the event. The aim of the event held on 30th August 2019 was to bring forward the best technologies in four focus areas: 


	Traffic management, transport and mobility, pollution management
	Water, sanitation and solid waste management 
	Safety, surveillance and security  
	Social (health, education, and citizen engagement) 


The solutions in the above focus sectors will help solve some of the pressing issues faced by Indian smart cities today. The showcase was a first step towards bringing the innovation ecosystem and smart cities closer to contributing towards the development of smart cities.

The start-ups and national science and technology research labs presented their solutions to smart city CEOs during small round table discussions wherein each CEO along with knowledge partners interacted with start-ups and research labs to understand their solutions better and identify possible synergies. The knowledge partners present at the event gave their inputs for the solutions presented to help them customize their innovation for smart cities.

Twelve smart city CEOs from Maharashtra and Gujarat along with various knowledge partners and R&D labs were present at the event. A total of nine start-ups got an excellent opportunity to present their technologies, interact and network with the various stakeholders present there. 

Smart city CEOs expressed intent to work with the start-ups and further materialise pathways to deploy these solutions in their respective smart cities. To take the initiative forward, Invest India along with Smart Cities Mission, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs will organize similar technology showcases in other zones of India as well.

                Union Minister for Communications, Electronics & Information Technology and Law & Justice Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad has launched the maritime communication services at Mumbai today. He said that Maritime Connectivity will enable high-end support to those in sea by providing access to Voice, Data and Video services while traveling on sailing vessels, cruise liners, ships in India, using satellite technology.

Nelco, India's leading VSAT solutions provider is the first Indian company that will now provide quality broadband services to the maritime sector. Nelco through global partnerships, infrastructure including transponder capacity on satellite of ISRO Indian Space Research Organization) and a comprehensive service portfolio will help Energy, Cargo and Cruise vessels by enhancing operational efficiency, improving crew welfare and enabling customer services. The IFMC licence has not only enabled connectivity for on-board users on ships but also brings operational efficiencies for shipping companies which were less evolved until now.

In December 2018, the Government of India announced the licenses for In-flight and Maritime Communications (IFMC) that allows voice and internet services while flying over the Indian skies and sailing in Indian waters, both for international and Indian aircrafts and vessels. The IFMC license is a key initiative of the Telecom Ministry, a move to liberalise satellite communication services in India.

Speaking on this occasion, Mr. P J Nath, MD and CEO of NELCO said that they will also be offering a bouquet of digital services to cater to the needs of the various types of maritime vessels. 

Shri Prasad also launched a web portal for reporting of stolen mobiles for tracing purposes.

International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is supposed to be an unique identity of a mobile phone device. Generally, a phone with one/two slots of SIM card is programmed with one/two IMEI number as the case may be. IMEI number being programmable, some miscreants do reprogram the IMEI number, which results in cloning of IMEI causing multiple phone devices with same IMEI number. As on date, there are many cases of cloned/duplicated IMEI handsets in the network. 

If such IMEI is blocked, a large number of mobile phones will get blocked being handsets with same IMEI causing inconvenience to many genuine customers. Thus, there is a need to eliminate duplicate/fake IMEI mobile phones from the network.

Accordingly, a project called Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR) system has been undertaken by the DoT for addressing security, theft and other concerns including reprogramming of mobile handsets. 

 


	The major objectives of the project include following:


 


	Blocking of lost/stolen mobile phones across mobile networks thus discouraging theft of mobile phones
	Facilitate in tracing of such reported lost/stolen mobile phones
	Prevention of mobile devices with duplicate and fake IMEIs in the network
	Curtail the use of counterfeit mobile devices 
	Reduced health risks to the users with the control of use of counterfeit mobile phones 
	Improved QoS and reduced call drops with reduction in use of counterfeit mobile devices 


 

 

Inflight and Maritime Telecom Connectivity

 

In a major policy decision, Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications had notified the Flight and Maritime Connectivity (FMC) Rules, 2018 on 14th December, 2018 permitting voice and data service provisioning in flights and ships. The policy intent of the Government is to open the airspace and territorial waters for telecommunication services for general public which was not possible earlier due to lack of enabling rules. Rules envisage creation of satellite gateway within India for providing telecom services in aircraft and ships through Indian licensed service providers. Further, Indian satellite bandwidth has to be utilised. If a foreign satellite is used, it has to be approved by ISRO.

 

Only the authorized IFMC service provider, can provide wireless voice or data or both type of services on ships within Indian territorial waters and on aircraft within or above India or Indian territorial waters. Territorial waters are 12 nautical miles from baseline of the coast and beyond that is the Exclusive Economic Zone upto 200 nautical miles (1 nautical mile is 1.852 Kms.). 7 Companies viz. (i) M/s Hughes Communications India Ltd., (ii) M/s Tatanet Services Ltd., (iii) M/s Indo Teleports Ltd., (iv) M/s BSNL, (v) M/s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., (vi) M/s Cloudcast Digital Ltd. & (vii) M/s Bharti Airtel Ltd. have taken the authorisation to provide Inflight and Maritime Connectivity (IFMC) services till date. 

 

Satellite bandwidth has been provided on Indian Satellites by ISRO for providing IFMC service.

                Government of India under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi has demonstrated unique boldness and decisiveness in the first 100 days of its second term. Addressing media persons on the achievements of the Modi.2.0 Government in its first 100 days, the Union Minister of Law and Justice, Communications and Electronics and Information Technology Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad said this in Ahmedabad today.

 

Allaying the fears of economic slowdown, the Union Minister categorically said that the fundamentals of Indian growth story are intact so the declining of GDP in the first quarter to 5% is certainly not a sign of overall disappointment. He added that the Central Government and the State Governments are taking multifold actions to protect the economy from worldwide recession and at the same time give an impetus to development through various measures such as credit expansion by PSBs, merger of PSBs and relaxing the norms for NBFCs. Mr Prasad said that a temporary slowdown will be checked by multidimensional pro-development efforts which will not only generate large scale employment but will also ensure enhanced private sector investment in sectors such as agro-processing, real estate and construction and other manufacturing sectors. Replying to a question, the Union Minister said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are well aware of the benefits of the Government’s action to abrogate various provisions of Article 370 and abolition of 35A. Lambasting Pakistan for gross human rights violations in PoK, the Minister asserted that if any talks in terror free atmosphere with Pakistan will be held that will be on PoK. Showering praise on the leadership of the PM, Shri Narendra Modi, he said that the decisiveness of leadership has provided clear directions for inclusive development of the nation as a whole. Enumerating the achievements further, the Minister said that there has been a quantum jump in the “ease of doing business” worldwide rank from 142nd in 2014 to 77th in 2019.


The Minister also cited simplification and digitization process in major tax structures as another significant feather in the cap. The Law Minister informed the media persons that abolition of triple talak and amendment of POCSO Act have been welcomed by all as deterrent laws in prevention of respective crimes. He further said that under PMJAY, 16,000 hospitals have been empaneled and 10 crore e-cards have been issued in addition to over 20,000 health and wellness centers being made operational. Mr Prasad lauded the PM KISAN Maan Dhan Yojana saying that crores of farmers are being benefitted under this scheme. The formation of new Jal Shakti Ministry is a landmark step in the direction of water- saving, water conservation and waste water treatment, the Minister opined.

 

The Minister of State for Home in Government of Gujarat Shri Pradeepsinh Jadeja, Members of Parliament Shri Hasmukh Patel and Dr Kirit Solanki were also present during the media interaction.

                The Union Minister for Communications, Electronics & IT and Law & Justice Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad today announced the rollout of Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) Services by India Post Payments Bank (IPPB), giving a strong boost to its efforts in expanding access to financial services for millions of unbanked and underbanked customers. Speaking at the First Anniversary Celebrations of IPPB here, the Minister congratulated IPPB for achieving the milestone of 1 Crore customers and exhorted them to achieve 5 crore target in next one year. Referring to 440 Central schemes on-boarded to the DBT platform, Shri Prasad said that all these schemes must ride on IPPB platform too. He said, ‘Inclusive’ is the key mantra of the government and the department of Posts should strive for Banking the unbanked, funding the unfunded and securing the unsecured.

 

With the launch of AEPS services, IPPB has now become the single largest platform in the country for providing interoperable banking services to the customers of ANY BANK by leveraging the last mile unprecedented reach of the Postal network. 

IPPB’s unparalleled network complimented with robust interoperable technology platform set up by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is poised to take banking to each & every household across the remotest parts of the country. With AePS services any common person with a bank account linked to Aadhaar can perform basic banking services such as cash withdrawals and balance enquiry irrespective of the bank they hold their account with. To avail these services, a customer with an Aadhaar linked account can simply authenticate his/her identity with fingerprint scan & Aadhaar authentication to complete a transaction. AePS services are bank-agnostic and are driven by an inexpensive infrastructure enabling low cost delivery of doorstep banking services to every section of the society without discrimination, thus bringing forth the dawn of a ‘Truly Inclusive Financial System’.

 

Speaking about the launch of AePS services, Shri Prasad said, “As the biggest Financial Inclusion initiative in the world, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana brought millions into the economic mainstream. There are over 34 crore Jan Dhan accounts out of which 22 crore account holders are in rural India. With IPPB’s AePS Services, we now have the ability to provide Interoperable Doorstep banking services to customers of ANY BANK including the 34 crore Jan Dhan account holders, by leveraging the unprecedented last mile reach of IPPB. This fulfills the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision set forth at the time of launch of IPPB last year of ushering in economic transformation by bringing banks to the doorsteps of the villagers and poor. I wish IPPB and its management all the success in its future growth journey.”

Shri. A.N. Nanda, Secretary, Department of Posts said, “It has been our belief that financial and banking services have a transformational impact on the lives of people and communities. For a significant majority of these people, the Postman and Grameen Dak Sevak (GDS) are the most important channel for delivery of various financial services at the last mile, making India Post Payments Bank the most accessible, affordable and trusted bank for them. The launch of AePS by India Post Payments Bank enhances the last mile interoperable banking infrastructure by 2.5 times. The network brings doorstep banking access to millions of underbanked customers and gives a fresh impetus to inclusion of customers facing accessibility challenges in the traditional banking ecosystem.”

Shri Suresh Sethi, Managing Director & CEO, India Post Payments Bank said, “With the launch of AePS services, IPPB has now become the single largest interoperable platform in the country. By leveraging AePS customers can now access their accounts with ANY BANK by simply using their fingerprint for cash withdrawal and balance enquiry right at their doorstep through the Postmen and GDS. IPPB’s services are now available across more than 136,000 Post Offices and delivered by over 195,000 Postmen and GDSs. The ability of the Postmen and GDS to reach every village on an almost daily basis has brought down the distance to access banking services to ‘0 kms', truly capturing the essence of Aapka Bank, Aapke Dwaar.”

                In view of sustained high price of onions in the market, the Central Government today took several steps to contain the prices namely, imposition of stock limits on traders, ban on exports and has asked State Governments to take strict measures to prevent hoarding by traders including organising raids.

 

2.         In a swift move, the Central Government today imposed stock limits on onion traders to facilitate release of stocks in the market and prevention of hoarding by traders.  In the past, Centre had authorised the State Governments to impose stock limits.  This time, Centre has decided to impose stock limits directly upon the States across India.  The stock limit of 100 quintal on retail traders and 500 quintals on wholesale traders has been imposed across the country today.

 

3.         Further, Government has banned export of onions with immediate effect till further orders for improving domestic availability.  Recently, on 13 September 2019, the Minimum Export Price of US$ 850 F.O.B. per metric ton was imposed on export of onions.  Though there was some reduction in export of onions thereafter, yet the exports were still continuing.  The ban on export of onions is expected to improve domestic availability and cool prices.

 

4.         Centre has asked the State Governments to enforce the stock limits strictly and carry out anti-hoarding operations against the unscrupulous traders by organising raids, etc.

 

5.         A Central buffer of about 56,700 MT was built by the Government through NAFED during Rabi 2019 season.  This buffer stock is being utilised for supplies to Delhi at a rate of not more than 23.90 per kg.  Haryana and Andhra Pradesh are also being supplied from the buffer.  Other States have also been asked to utilise this buffer and indicate their demand for the same to Department of Consumer Affairs and/or NAFED.

 

6.         The reported export below Minimum Export Price to Bangladesh & Sri Lanka will be immediately stopped and strict action will be initiated against those who are found to be violating this decision of the Central Government.

                The Central Government has taken several key decisions to curb rise in prices of Onions today.Concerned over rise in prices of Onions, the central Governmentannounced the following key decisions:


	States have been requested to utilize a stockof 35,000 ton available with the Central Government for direct retailing to ease the pressure on prices. Communication in this regard was sentto the State Governments asking them to indicate their requirement from the Central Buffer. Till date, 5 States namely, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Tripura and Odisha have demanded Onions from this stock.


 


	NAFED which holds the Central Buffer on behalf of Union Government has been directed to distribute Onions in Delhi through stores of Safal, Mother dairy, NCCF and its own outletsat a fixed rate of not more than Rs. 24 per kilo.The Central Government also offered the Delhi Government, Onions from its Buffer stocks for direct retailing through its channels at similar rates. This would improve the total number of distribution centres across Delhi to about 700 outlets.


 


	The Kharif crop of Onion from Karnataka has already started arriving in the market and this will ease the pressure on supply from Maharashtra as well as prices in adjoining regions.


 


	There is sufficient stock of Onions in Maharashtra to meet the current demand. However, Supplies are seemingly being restrained to increase prices. Government is taking all measures to improve these supplies and from Central buffer to mitigate any such shortfall in availability and will also consider imposing stock limit if prices do not moderate on account of speculative behaviour of traders.


 


	MMTC has also been directed to float a tender for import of Onions to meet any short fall in availability.


 


	NAFED has also been directed to be in preparedness for meeting any contingencies during the ensuing festive season and move sufficient stock in advance to places of consumption and distribution to ensure that supply remains unhindered.


 


	The reported export below Minimum Export Price to Bangladesh& Sri Lanka will be immediately stopped and strict action will be initiated against those who are found to be violating this decision of the government.

Addressing the media after the meeting, Shri Paswan stated that the meeting was held with all stakeholders, Regulators and officials to review the ‘Process of Making Standards’ and also deliberate on improving the implementation and enforcement of the set Standards. Shri Paswan urged all stakeholders to provide all their suggestions in this regard by 17th September, 2019. Shri Paswan also said that the purpose of setting standards and enforcing them is not intended to bring back ‘’inspector raj’’ but to ensure that quality products are made available for all consumers across the country.  

Shri Paswan asserted that Indian Standards should be set as per global benchmarks and just like other countries enforce their standards on imported products. Similarly, foreign goods coming into India should also comply with Indian standards. He said that this should be done on a reciprocal basis for International goods and a system should be put in place for effective monitoring and checking to ensure that they are effectively enforced.

Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs, Shri Avinash K Srivastava expressed happiness at the fact that the time taken to complete the process of Standards formation has been reduced from 24 months earlier to 18 months now. He said that detailed discussions were held on “One Nation One Standard” and for that it is important that BIS is empowered. Shri Srivastava also said that since the BIS is a National Standards body, residuary powers are vested with BIS, all other standard making bodies must work in coordination with BIS.

Dr. D K Paul, Member, NITI Aayog informed the media that NITI Aayog is currently working on a draft Medical Devices Bill which will help to tackle the problem of non-standard medical devices coming into the market.  It was stated that devices of 23 categories are regulated and notified under drugs and the attempt is to do this on a comprehensive scale.

The gathering was also informed that the standard set for Bullet Proof Jackets in India is higher than global benchmarks and India is only the 4th country in the world to have such a standard after USA, Germany and UK. He said that the standard has been set after due consultations with stakeholders and it is now being exported to several countries under the ‘’Make in India’’ initiative.

Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan today met key stakeholders from Plastic bottle industry and senior government officials from various ministries to find suitable alternative for single use plastic. During the meeting various alternatives to plastics were discussed including Glass, Metal, Paper and Natural Polymers. The Senior Economic adviser from the Ministry at the onset explained the various dangers associated with plastics. He said that micro-plastics contaminate the soil and water resources, influence animal tissues and also become active breeding ground for mosquitos etc. Therefore, the need of the hour he said, is to find suitable alternatives to plastic.

Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswan asserted that plastic plays a major role in damaging environment and has adverse impact on the health of human beings as well as animals. Shri Paswan stated that kilos of plastic material is extracted from cows’ stomach, collected from beaches in Mumbai and also chokes our rivers such as Yamuna. He further said that recycling is not a permanent solution and apermanent solution is that plastic should be banned and replaced. Shri Paswan also said there is a need to find an alternative, which is equally affordable and reliable. He said even paper bottle is not an alternative as some plastic is mixed in that too.

Shri Ram Vilas Paswan asked manufacturers of packaged drinking water to come up with alternative packaging solutions in the next three days and also asked all manufacturers to send their suggestions by September 11. He informed that an inter-ministerial committee, under the chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary, has been formed to look into the issue of banning single use plastic either all at once or in a phased manner. The suggestions as received would be sent to the inter-ministerial panel and the Prime Ministers’ Office (PMO) after which the final decision would be taken by the government.

Addressing the media after the meeting, Shri Paswan said that the ban would not affect employment as the ‘alternative to plastic’ would create jobs. Railway ministry which manufactures and sell packaged drinking water under 'Rail Neer' brand is also looking for alternatives including inserting polymers to make the bottle biodegradable.

During the meeting, the status on various plastic materials presently allowed for packing of drinking water including restrictions, both at national and international levels were discussed. All the participants agreed that there is a need for innovation in recycling and finding new alternatives to develop packing materials which were safe for use and in fighting the menace of environmental pollution. The meeting was attended by several stakeholders including Secretary, Consumer Affairs Shri Avinash K Srivastava, DG, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), FSSAI, CIPET, CSIR along with officials from the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Jal Shakti, Petroleum, Railways and big private manufacturers such as Bisleri, Kinley and Pepsi Co.

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution held the Fifth National Consultation Meeting of State Ministers, Secretaries and other officials of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairsat VigyanBhawan in New Delhi today. Union Minister Shri Ram Vilas Paswan presided over the proceeding and interacted with all the participants in a free and open manner to seek their suggestions on various new initiatives of the Ministry and also understand their concerns and look for ways to address them. Wide ranging discussions were held on consumer empowerment, protection and welfare, National Portability of Ration Cards, automation of Fair Price Shops, Aadhaar seeding etc with State Ministers from Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Manipur, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, UP and West Bengal.

Addressing the media after the consultative meeting, Shri Paswan expressed happiness that State Governments widely participated in the event and discussed implementation of several key initiatives of the Government. Shri Ram Vilas Paswan exhorted State governments to buy Pulses and Onions from Central buffer for retailing in their respective States/UTs to check price rise and ease pressure on prices. The Minister stressed on the need for creation of a Price Stabilization Fund in each State so as to ensure that price rise can be effectively tacked at the State level itself.

The Union Ministeralso sought inputs from State Governments on simplification of Essential Commodities Act in general to boost investments specifically in the agriculturalsector and also penal provisions to make it more attuned to government’s policy regarding “Ease of doing business”. Shri Paswan highlighted the fact that all States are now covered under NFSA as compared to just 11 States in 2014. Shri Paswan emphasised on the need for larger State participation in Rice Fortification Scheme as well as the portability of Ration Cards.

Shri Paswan asked the representing officials from Jammu and Kashmir to give their requirements under NFSA so that the requisite food grains can be stocked up before the onset of winters. During winters, due to bad weather, it becomes difficult for the transportation of food grains and therefore they were requested to provide their demand in advance.

The Minister of State, Shri RaosahebPatilDanve addressing the State governments stated that there is a need for effective and time bound implementation of digitisation of PDS system. He urged State governments to come forwards with the issues being faced by them so that a discussions can be held on finding solutions.

 It was emphasised during the meeting that empowering and protecting consumers is the joint responsibility of both the Centre and the State governments and achievement of this objective entails coordinated action between both. The action plan for the next year was also adopted in the meeting.

Through the exhibition, efforts have been made to highlight the talent of the artists to the public.



46 textile objects were displayed in the exhibition that are hand-woven on traditional Indian draw looms over last twenty-five years at ASHA, a silk weaving workshop at Varanasi. To situate the textiles within the milieu of luxury arts in which they were traditionally created, they shall be juxtaposed with 21 objects comprising of historic textiles, miniature paintings, jewellery and decorative arts from the reserve collection of the National Museum.

Believed to be India’s oldest and most sacred city, Kashi (Varanasi) has been a spiritual destination for Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina pilgrims since the first millennium BCE. From around the same time, the city has been celebrated for its textiles and in recent centuries for weaving luminousgold- and silver-brocaded silks that mirror the transcendental light of its sacred river, the Ganga.

The exhibition will showcase the greatest range and diverse products of Asha through varied technical aspects, discernible shift in pattern and materials across their full range. The exhibition shall also depict the story of the finest Indian textiles produced at Varanasi. The textiles showcased in the exhibition are created under the guidance of Padma Shri Rahul Jain, a leading expert on the traditional textile arts of India. Textiles woven at the Asha workshop today feature in several major museum collections including the British Museum, London; the Musee Guimet, Paris; the Art Institute of Chicago,and the Textile Museum, Washington DC.

                Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Dr. Harsh Vardhan and Minister of State for Culture (Independent Charge) Shri Prahlad Singh Patel jointly inaugurated the exhibition ‘Superbugs: The End of Antibiotics?’ today at National Science Centre, New Delhi. The Exhibition explores how society is responding to the enormous challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and antibacterial resistance (ABR) in particular featuring scientific research from across the globe and personal stories of those waging war on Superbugs. 

 

Union Minister of Health Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that it is a matter of great pleasure that a large number of children have gathered in today's program. Many times children are able to accomplish big things, if they are determined. During the polio campaign, children contributed to making the campaign a success by creating ‘polio sainiks’. He added that he actively practiced as a doctor for almost 25 years but apart from two three antibiotics he has never prescribed any antibiotics. So the practioners of medical professional should also exercise caution in this regard. 

 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Patel said that the way National Council of Science Museums has designed planned & arranged this exhibition is very effective. He added that antibiotic has reduced our immunity, which has become a serious problem. He further stated that it is our duty to create awareness among the future generation about the limited use of antibiotics. He highlighted the importance of social media to create awareness to the masses. He reiterated the Prime Minister’s view that we should avoid using too many antibiotics for quick recovery. The Minister further added that I assure you that the Ministry is ready to help in every way and appealed to everyone to cooperate in making more people aware of this exhibition. 

 

 

The exhibition has been organised by National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) in collaboration with Science Museum, Group, London, Wellcome (UK) and supported by ICMR.

Bacteria, tiny organisms capable of causing disease are becoming resistant to our most powerful weapon against them, antibiotics and turning into Superbugs. Today antibiotic-resistant 'Superbugs' kill up to 7,00,000 people a year. By 2050 that could rise to 10 million.

The exhibition has three major sections: Microscopic, Human and Global. Microscopic Section explores the hidden world of bacteria. Be it their size or characteristics, evolution of superbugs or history of antibiotics; the exhibits of this section will take you on a journey in which you can zoom into the world of microbes, explore the touch screen multimedia to understand how bacteria evolve into superbugs or flip a digital e-book to know the history of antibiotics.

On the other hand, Human Section showcases several stories, specifically from India, of how people are reaching out to combat the challenge of antibacterial resistance. When antibiotics stop working, lives are put at risk. People catch infections that can’t be treated. Hospitals find it difficult to keep the spread of bacteria under control. Farmers can’t treat their animals when they become ill. Our environment poses several risks for spreading ABR in human and animals as well. The section highlights how Doctors, Patients, Scientists, Researchers, Nurses, Campaigners, Pharmacist, Farmers all need to work in tandem to cope up with problem.

Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri A. D. Choudhury, Director General, NCSM, Prof. Balram Bhargava, Secretary, DHR & DG, ICMR, Dr. Renu Swarup, Secretary, Dept. of Biotechnology, Govt. of India, Ms. Jan Thompson, Deputy British High Commissioner to India, Mr. Jonathan Newby, MD, Science Museum Group.. 

The exhibition is supported by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and British Council, India. For Details about the exhibition, please visit the website www.superbugs.in

Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said that Mobile Science Exhibition in Ladakh will benefit all the people of Ladakh through its mobility and knowledge. He said that Mobile Science Exhibition (MSE) programme, originally launched as Mobile Science Museum (MSM) in 1965, with a mission ‘If the people cannot visit the museum, let the museum visit the people at their doorsteps’, is the largest and the longest running outreach programme of NCSM. It is very successful in supplementing formal education with non-formal mode of science education, in creating a scientific awareness in the society and nurturing scientific temper and creative potential of the young people in the areas where MSE programmes are conducted, the Minister explained.

 



 

The Union Culture Minister simultaneously launched 25 new Mobile Science Exhibition buses for Aspirational Districts of India. Speaking on the occasion, he said that it is a rare moment to carry out the  National launch of 25 new Mobile Science Exhibition buses from  Leh. He explained that considering the vastness of our country and the need to reach out to the unreached, Ministry of Culture has taken a drive to launch 25 new MSE buses this year in the Aspirational Districts.

 



 

 

The Minister further stated that the Government of India aims to upgrade the districts which have shown relatively less progress in achieving key social outcomes through a mass movement. This will help to quickly and effectively transform these districts named as ‘Aspirational Districts’. He also informed that to fulfil this objective, NCSM, an autonomous S&T institution under the Ministry of Culture jointly with the Department of Science &Technology (DST), Government of India is launching 25 new Mobile Science Exhibition Buses specifically for these aspirational districts. The buses will travel to schools in Aspirational Districts through out the year except during the vacations and will aim to create a scientific awareness among the rural children. Each specially designed bus contains 20 interactive exhibits and other demonstrations related to children and rural life. More Exhibition buses will be added in coming years, he added.

The Union Minister also said that several other buses will roll out with exhibition the same day in different parts of the country simultaneously. The program has been fully funded by Ministry of Culture, Govt. of India, he added.

The topics chosen for these exhibitions are:

1.Measurement

2. Machines in everyday life

3.Food & Health

4.Chemistry & Life with focus on Water

5.Energy

6. Hygiene & Sanitation

7. Space Science for Human Welfare

 

What is a Mobile Science Exhibition (MSE) Programme?

Tfirst MSE on the theme ‘Our Familiar Electricity’ was inaugurated at Ramakrishna Mission Boys’ School, Narendrapur, near Kolkata on 17th November 1965. The first MSE Bus was flagged off in 1966 from Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, Kolkata.

Mounted on a specially designed bus, a Mobile Science Exhibition carries a number of interactive exhibits related to everyday science. The MSE or Museo-bus travels from school to school in rural areas and organize exhibitions there throughout the year. Along with the exhibition, some other programmes like Sky Observation Programme through telescope, science films show, Science Demonstration Lectures etc. are also organised. 

Why MSE Programme in Leh,Ladakh Region:

The Science Explorer MSE programme in the Leh, Ladakh region will be the first of its kind in the region with a broad objective to:


	   Popularize science and technology among the students and general public.
	    Creating a scientific awareness in the society.
	    Inculcating a spirit of enquiry among the young people.
	Inspiring youngsters to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
	Supplementing formal education imparted in schools and colleges with non-formal science education.

                 A seminal achievement was accomplished in the quest for technologies related to operation of indigenous fighter aircraft from aircraft carriers. On 29 September, 2019, LCA Naval Prototype-2 launched off the ski jump at 1621 hours and then subsequently “trapped” at 1631 hrs on the arresting gear site (both locations situated at Shore Based Test Facility INS Hansa, Goa). While both these activities had been achieved individually earlier, this was the first occasion when the complete cycle of launch and recovery necessary for aircraft carrier operations was accomplished in a single sortie.  



Being a pioneering technology acquisition and demonstration program for the unique Short Take-Off but Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) concept of aircraft operations, the LCA (Navy) team has had to conceptualise and experiment with complex software modes from a clean slate. All this had to be done while tentatively exploring and incrementally expanding the structural capabilities of the aircraft to withstand the brutal requirements of carrier operations. The exploratory nature of this stage of the programme necessitates experimentation with multiple software options and hardware configurations. These include multiple configurations of aerodynamic surfaces, different flight control strategies, avionics tools and display symbols to ease the piloting task, multiple iterations to the “mechanicals” (dampers/structural members/contact points) etc.

Comprehensive and seamless integration of all these experimental variants simultaneously into a single platform is therefore not possible till all options have been evaluated and the preferred configuration has been decided. The events on September 29, 2019, therefore, demonstrate the completion of the basic exploration phase of the programme and transition to refinement and improvement iterations.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has congratulated DRDO, ADA, HAL and Indian Navy for this major feat. Secretary, Department of Defence, R&D and Chairman DRDO Dr. G Satheesh Reddy also congratulated DRDO, ADA, HAL and Indian Navy for the achievement.

                The Indian Navy is ready to defend the country against all threats, Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh said today while addressing the personnel of Western Fleet, during his “day at sea” onboard INS Vikramaditya off the Goa coast. After witnessing the prowess and fire power of the Western Fleet first hand, Raksha Mantri said, “I am most impressed to see the professionalism, commitment and spirited approach shown by the brave sailors of the Indian Navy. I am reassured that the security of our nation is in safe hands”. 

            Emphasising that security of India relies a lot on being strong at sea, Shri Rajnath Singh lauded the multi-dimensional approach adopted by the Navy to ensure safety and security in the country’s areas of maritime interest. He said, the Navy’s Mission Based Deployments at critical regions of the Indian Ocean have strengthened the maritime security environment in the region. 

            Raksha Mantri also commended the Western Fleet which was immediately deployed in a strong posture in the northern Arabian Sea when the Government effectively responded to the Pulwama attacks through strikes on terror camps in Balakot. He said, “Western Fleet degraded the ability of our adversary and ensured they did not attempt any misadventure at sea”. Shri Rajnath Singh termed as most significant the role of Indian Navy to have a credible “second strike” capability as a Nuclear deterrent. 

            Saying that Indian Naval ships are continuously deployed for anti-piracy operations, Raksha Mantri commended the Navy for demonstrating and re-affirming its role as a Net Security Provider in the Indian Ocean Region. He said, the Navy has been able to achieve credible deterrence by maintaining a very high degree of preparedness through regular training, quality maintenance and strategic situational awareness. He also termed naval deployments as an important tool of diplomacy which is essential to build bonds with friendly nations. 

Describing Navy as the key enabler and guarantor of the India’s maritime security, Raksha Mantri said, India’s economic resurgence is directly linked to its overseas trade and energy needs, most of which is by sea. “About 90 percent of India's international trade by volume and about 70 percent by value are carried by sea. As we move towards our goal of 5 trillion dollar economy; the volume of maritime trade will only grow in times to come. Thus, I firmly believe that the role of the Indian Navy in general and the Western Fleet in particular is also critical in ensuring the energy security and economic growth of the country”, he added. 

            Shri Rajnath Singh said the Government’s commitment towards building a strong and modern Navy was evident in the time of Atal ji also when strong policy decisions to increase funding for warship construction were taken in order to build ‘blue water’ capability for the Navy. He suggested a push for a ‘blue water’ navy considering the increasing prestige and economic power of the country. 

            Listing out the measures implemented by the Government in this direction, Raksha Mantri said, induction and integration of new state-of-the-art equipment through the Prime Minister’s ‘Make in India’ initiative is making the Indian Navy amongst the most advanced Navies of the world today. “Our indigenously built destroyers, frigates, submarines, patrol vessels and attack craft are a testimony of the industrial strength of the country and the role of the Navy towards empowering domestic technologies and industries is noteworthy”, he added. 

            On commissioning INS Khanderi, the second indigenously built Scorpene class submarine, launching ‘Nilgiri’, the first of the indigenous Project 17A frigates and commissioning the Aircraft Carrier Dock at Naval Dockyard, Raksha Mantri said, “this is an indication of a self-reliant India and generates confidence about our maritime power and the bright future of the country.” 

            Recalling his visit to the world’s highest battle field at Siachen at the start of his term as Raksha Mantri, Shri Rajnath Singh saluted the unwavering commitment of the ‘Siachen Warriors’ to prevail in extreme harsh weather and highly treacherous terrain for maintaining the sanctity of Indian borders and ensuring utmost safety of fellow countrymen. He also said, his experience of flying the fourth-generation aircraft “Tejas” made him appreciate the professionalism, courage and bravery of the pilots of Indian Air Force even more. 

During his stay on INS Vikramaditya, the biggest ship of Indian Navy, Raksha Mantri witnessed a wide range of naval operations including weapon firing by the fighter aircraft and night flying operations by helicopter from the deck of the Aircraft Carrier. In addition, surface shoots, Missile and Rocket firing by various ships Underway Replenishment with multiple ships and submarines operations were also demonstrated. Shri Rajnath Singh witnessed operations at sea which included simultaneous underway replenishment of multiple warships by the tanker, ensuring prolonged sustenance at sea. 

Raksha Mantri joined the ship’s crew during morning Yoga followed by a walk around the Aircraft Carrier. He was also briefed on the reach of Indian Navy and enhanced Maritime Domain Awareness. He also spoke to INS Mysore, deployed in the Strait of Hormuz, through video conferencing. Shri Rajnath Singh also interacted with the crew of INS Vikramaditya over Barakhana. 

The visit culminated with the Steam Past and Fly Past - the traditional naval salutation by ships, submarines and aircraft of Western Naval Command. 

The Raksha Mantri was accompanied by the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh, Flag Offcer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command Vice Admiral Ajith Kumar and Rear Admiral Jasjit Singh Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh today said, the Government is making concerted efforts to modernise the Navy and equip it with the best platforms, weapons and sensors to deal with any conventional and unconventional threats to India’s maritime interests. Shri Rajnath Singh was speaking at the launch of INS ‘Nilgiri’, the first of the Navy's seven new stealth frigates, at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited in Mumbai. He said, 70% of India’s trade by value and 95% by volume is taking place through the sea route and even a slight disruption of seaborne trade due to piracy, terrorism or conflict, could have serious repercussions on the economic growth and well-being of the nation.

Raksha Mantri said, India is growing and its commercial interests are spreading far and beyond, yet there are challenges, including a hostile neighbourhood. “State-sponsored terrorism remains a challenge and the strong-willed Government will not hesitate to take tough decisions in the larger interest of the country. The repealing of the provisions under article 370 of the constitution is one such decision. We are confident that this will usher a new era of development and prosperity in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh”, Raksha Mantri added.

Saying that “any credible defence of a country is based on the indigenous defence capability”, Shri Rajnath Singh emphasised on ‘Make in India’ and ‘Design and Make in India’ with regard to defence equipment. 

Raksha Mantri highlighted that Directorate of Naval Design has designed over 19 classes of ships to which more than 90 ships have been built since then. He said, today India belongs to an elite group of nations which is building its own Aircraft Carrier and Strategic Submarines. “Out of total 51 ships and submarines on order at various shipyards as on date, 49 are being constructed indigenously. This contributes to our target of building a five trillion dollar economy by 2025 and 70% defence indigenisation by 2027”, he said.

“A vibrant shipbuilding industry can play a major role in the overall economic development of the country”, Raksha Mantri said adding that shipbuilding is a labour intensive industry with tremendous potential for employment generation, not only in its own sector, but also in various upstream and downstream industries. He noted that construction of one frigate itself provides direct employment to 4,800 personnel and indirect employment to around 27,000 personnel for a period of 8 years. Almost 87% of the total warship cost is invested in the Indian economy which significantly contributes to nation building.

Raksha Mantri said, the Indian Ocean region is the epicentre of activity and the entire world sees Indian Navy as a Net Security Provider. He said, with growing stature of India in geo-political and geo-strategic dimension and increasing reliance of neighbors on us, it is the Navy’s responsibility to provide credible security and peaceful and prosperous sea routes.

Shri Rajnath Singh added that, “while the Navy is continuously evolving to meet emerging challenges to India’s maritime interests by means of state-of-the-art platforms and infrastructure, the core strength of our forces remain our men and women”.

Raksha Mantri expressed confidence that Nilgiri and the other six ships of the Project will proudly fly the Indian Flag across the oceans, showcasing India’s shipbuilding prowess and would spread India's message of peace and strength across the globe. He appreciated the work done by the workforce of the shipyard, saying that the ship is not just metal and paint, it is a story of hard work, sweat and perseverance of the men and women involved with the project.

INS Nilgiri is the first ship of Project17A. Project 17A frigates is a design derivative of the Shivalik class stealth frigates with much more advanced stealth features and indigenous weapons and sensors. These frigates are being built using integrated construction methodology. The P17A frigates incorporate new design concepts for improved survivability, sea keeping, stealth and ship manoeuvrability.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh also commissioned the largest dry dock of Indian Navy - The Aircraft Carrier Dock at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai. He termed it as an “edifice of modern India”.

                Government is deeply conscious of the requirements of the Armed Forces and remains committed in providing requisite focus and financial support for its modernisation, Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh said today at the Commissioning Ceremony of indigenously built submarine INS Khanderi in Mumbai. Shri Rajnath Singh said due impetus has been given for timely acquisition of state-of-the-art weapons, sensors and platforms, adding that the Government has given more freedom and support to armed forces to take decisions in the nation’s interest. “We are committed to far-reaching changes in our defence preparedness”, he said.

“You cannot buy a confident Navy. A confident Navy is always built by a confident Government”, Raksha Mantri said, adding that the Indian Navy has the confidence which no other country in the Indian Ocean possesses.

Shri Rajnath Singh urged not just the security forces, but every citizen of the country to stay alert and united to meet any future challenges. “We have to be on the guard against state and non-state actors from across the border”, he said.

Underlining the importance of Oceans in development trajectory of a nation, Raksha Mantri said, oceans are gateway of opportunities as well as grave threats if the maritime forces are not alert. He said, the Indian Navy should be the last men standing in the Indian Ocean Region. “We need to safeguard the sea lanes of Indian Ocean to maintain and promote peace & trade in the region. We care about the Indian Ocean & we will take strong action if anyone tries to disturb the peace”, Raksha Mantri added.

Shri Rajnath Singh said the nation can never forget the exceptional role it played in 1971 war when Operation Trident and Operation Python broke the backbone of Pakistan Navy. He said Pakistan should understand that today with the Government’s strong resolve and advancement in naval capacity with additions like INS Khanderi, India is capable of giving a much bigger blow to it.

Shri Rajnath Singh also said Government’s progressive steps in Jammu and Kashmir are receiving global support, while the Prime Minister of Pakistan is running door-to-door unsuccessfully. He said, during the recent visit of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to USA, President Donald Trump acknowledged the potential of the Indian Government and was of the view that Shri Modi is capable of handling Pakistan-based terrorism.

Raksha Mantri assured the Indian Navy will not pose any threat to any peace-loving nation but will build a sense of confidence and mutual trust with all big-small nations in the Indian Ocean Region.

Shri Rajnath Singh highlighted “Security and Growth for All in the Region” (SAGAR), saying that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi articulated it keeping up with India’s collaborative approach in the wider Indian Ocean Region. “We believe in peaceful and mutually beneficial co-existence with our neighbours”, he said. Raksha Mantri added protected sea lanes have a positive impact on trade.

Describing INS Khanderi as a ‘potent combatant’, Shri Rajnath Singh congratulated the Navy and the Western Naval Command on its induction and for achieving very high levels of operational preparedness prior its commissioning. He said it is a matter of great pride that India is one of the few countries capable of constructing their own Submarine.

Raksha Mantri said construction of submarines not only benefits the industry, but also helps evolve a positive culture of stringent quality control and complex engineering. “It brings plough-back benefits for the economy of the nation at large with significant contributions towards ‘Make in India’”, he added.

Shri Rajnath Singh termed the commissioning of INS Khanderi as yet another significant and historic step in showcasing the will and intent of the Government.

“The name Khanderi is inspired by the dreaded ‘Sword Tooth Fish’ a deadly fish known to hunt whilst swimming close to the bottom of the ocean. Khanderi is also name of an island fort built by great Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He was man of great valour, courage and determination. He was one of the first Indian ruler in medieval era to recognise importance of strong Navy. Commissioning of INS Khanderi will bring same valour and sharpness back on sea.”, Shri Rajnath Singh said.

INS Khanderi is the second of Kalvari Class diesel electric attack submarines of the Indian Navy. It has been built in India to the French Scorpene design and is the second submarine of the Project-75. Built indigenously by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, INS Khanderi is a lethal addition to Navy’s conventional submarine arsenal and is designed for silent and stealthy sub-surface operations.

INS Khanderi is the follow-on to INS Kalvari, which was the first of the French origin Scorpene class submarines being indigenously constructed in India and commissioned by the Prime Minister in 2017.

First put out to sea in 2017, INS Khanderi has undergone comprehensive sea trials, torpedo and missile firings to validate her fighting capability. She was handed over to the Indian Navy on completion of trials on September 19, 2019. At 67.5 meters long and 12.3 meters high, Khanderi embodies cutting edge technologies that ensure stealthy, silent operations underwater and is equipped with an array of torpedoes, missiles and sensors that enable her to detect, identify and destroy enemy targets.

The first submarine was commissioned into the Indian Navy on December 6, 1968 and was decommissioned on October 18, 1989 after 20 years of service to the nation.

                Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik has reiterated the government’s commitment in pursuing defence modernisation to fulfil the aspirations of the 130-crore Indians and domestic Defence Industry. Addressing India Defence & Security Expo 2019 on the theme ‘Make in India 2.0’ at Indian Institute of Technology here today, Shri Naik said, the government under the dynamic and effective leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has enhanced defence production in the country under the ‘Make in India’ Initiative. “It is time, Indian Armed Forces fought wars in the Subcontinent with Indian industry made weapon systems”, said the Raksha Rajya Mantri. 

 

Underlining the significance of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Defence Production, the RRM called upon all concerned to focus on MSMEs, saying they are employment generators, innovators, focussed with niche expertise, flexible, adaptive and resilient. He added that MSMEs have the power to shape the future of the national Defence Industry. 

 

Advocating an integrated approach to the defence industry, Shri Naik said, “it is time we do not talk of, ‘we’ and ‘they’ and find methods of PPP between DPSUs/OFB and the private sector. The efficiencies in the global industry through best practices must be taken advantage of.”

 

Appreciating the industry for giving attention to the Defence Industry Corridors, the RRM said that the industry was capable of creating holistic capabilities in various identified disciplines for achieving strategic Independence. “Our government is looking at the big picture, that of ‘Strategic Independence’. This can be effectively established only if we can reduce our import dependence,” added Shri Naik. 

 

Also present at the event were Additional Director General (Perspective Plan - PP), Army Design Bureau Maj Gen A K Channan; President and Managing Director, Airbus India Shri Anand E Stanley; President, Boeing India Shri Salil Gupte; Secretary General, Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry (ASSOCHAM) Shri Deepak Sood and other senior officials of the Ministry and the Industry.

                As part of Indian Navy's Overseas Deployment to Africa, Europe and Russia, Indian Naval Ship Tarkash arrived at Maputo, Mozambique on 25 Sep 19 for a three day visit. INS Tarkash, commanded by Captain Sathish Vasudev, is a potent frontline frigate of the Indian Navy equipped with a versatile range of weapons and sensors. The ship is part of the Indian Navy's Western Fleet and under the Operational Command of Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Naval Command, based at Mumbai.

During the port call, the Commanding Officer will pay courtesy calls on various dignitaries and government officials of Mozambique including the Minister of National Defence, Government of Mozambique, Chief of General Staff, Mozambique Defence Forces and Commander of Mozambique Navy. Professional interactions are planned with the Mozambique Navy towards further enhancing co-operation between the two navies. In addition, social engagements, sports events and best practices will also be shared between the two Navies. Further, the ship would be kept open for visitors on 27 Sep 19. 

 Mozambique and India have traditionally enjoyed warm and friendly bilateral relations, sharing common values of democracy, development and secularism. There have been regular high level exchanges and interactions in numerous fields between both countries. Bilateral Defence Cooperation is being progressed through regular Joint Defence Working Group (JDWG) meetings. Indian Naval Ships Sujata, Shardul, Magar and ICGS Sarathi, of the First Training Squadron undertook a port call at Beira in Mar 19 and provided Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) to the local population in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai. 

Indian Navy ships are regularly deployed overseas as part of Indian Navy's mission of building 'bridges of friendship' and strengthening international cooperation with friendly countries.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has called for a proactive coordination among all agencies and stakeholders involved in coastal security to achieve the common goal of national security. He was addressing a gathering at the Commissioning Ceremony of Indian Coast Guard Ship (ICGS) ‘Varaha’ in Chennai today. Raksha Mantri exuded confidence that ICGS ‘Varaha’ will further strengthen the Coast Guard fleet in responding to the threats of maritime terrorism, smuggling and challenges of maritime law enforcement. He hoped that ICGS ’Varaha’ will enhance the surveillance and patrolling capabilities of Indian Coast Guard and reinforce their role as ‘Sentinels of our Seas’.

Highlighting Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR)’, Raksha Mantri said, as a responsible maritime power, oceans have been the Government’s foremost policy priorities.

Raksha Mantri described ICGS ’Varaha’ as a fine example of collaboration with industry and ‘Make in India’ where Larsen & Toubro (L&T) shipbuilding has played a very important role in production and maintenance of our sea-based assets.

Shri Rajnath Singh said, “the name ‘Varaha’ is taken from Puranas, who was the third incarnation of Lord Vishnu which took the form of Boar to protect mother earth by carrying her out of the sea on his tusks. It reminds us of the principle of sacrifice and rescue in the duty of saving mother earth”.

Raksha Mantri also stressed on the need to ensure availability of world class assets, both commercial vessels & warships, in adequate numbers to achieve maritime supremacy. He said, there is no other way of providing the needed numbers than having a strong and vibrant shipbuilding industry.

“Great fleets cannot be just bought, they have to be built”, said Raksha Mantri.

Appreciating the important role played by private players in the indigenisation of shipbuilding technology, Shri Rajnath Singh urged them to develop naval equipment of stringent standards.

Raksha Mantri said, the Government has taken a conscious decision to encourage other shipyards, including private yards, to enter the specialised field of warship-construction. He termed the response as encouraging.

“There are not many countries in the world having capability to produce such a wide variety of warships ranging from Fast Attack Craft to Aircraft Carrier”, Raksha Mantri added.

Shri Rajnath Singh said, an Indian Naval Indigenisation Plan from 2015-2030, as a guideline document, has been formulated in pursuance to the Government’s vision of ‘Make in India’. He said, the document is aimed to enable indigenous development of equipment and systems over the next 15 years.

Raksha Mantri commended ‘Swachh Sagar Abhiyan’ of Indian Coast Guard in line with ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ saying that “Clean oceans are important for India’s Economic prosperity and sustainability”. He said, ICGS ‘Varaha’ is capable of carrying Pollution response equipment. He also lauded the initiatives of ICG like Community Interaction Programmes and Safety Awareness drives for the fishermen and making them as “Eyes and Ears” for a national cause.

Earlier, ICGS ‘Varaha’, the state-of-the-art offshore patrol vessel, was commissioned into the Coast Guard fleet. It is the fourth among the series of seven ships to be delivered by L&T with features like ultra-advanced navigation, communication sensors and machinery. It will operate from the port of New Mangalore on the West Coast covering Exclusive Economic Zone up to Kanyakumari.

ICGS ‘Varaha’ is capable of operating the indigenously-developed Advanced Light Helicopter by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). The ship is well equipped with high speed boats, medical facilities and modern surveillance systems.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh also undertook a tour of ICGS ‘Varaha’ and was briefed about the functioning of the vessel by Director General, ICG Shri K. Natarajan.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has called for a 24x7 vigil, co-ordination and pro-active approach from all agencies in the Maritime domain to thwart any potential threats posed by 'non-state' as well as 'state-sponsored' terrorism. He was addressing the Investiture Ceremony of Indian CoastGuard (ICG) in Chennai today.

Raksha Mantri voiced the Government’s unwavering commitment to ensure that the people of the country feel safe and contribute towards nation-building.“The security at land is strongly linked to security at sea. Our country is facing significant challenges from 'non-state', as well as 'state-sponsored' terrorism. The attack of 26/11 happened through sea route only. It is the strong resolve of this government that we will not let such incidents to happen on our territory”, said Shri Rajnath Singh.

Raksha Mantri also lauded ICG for playing a pivotal role in building the synergy and cohesion of efforts between all stakeholders responsible for ensuring safety and security in the Maritime zones. Describing it as vibrant, Shri Rajnath Singh said ICG has been at the forefront in evolving regional co-operation and is steadily working with international maritime agencies for lasting maritime peace in the Indian Ocean region. He expressed happiness that ICG has become a Maritime Force to reckon with and is responding to a multitude of challenges in the Maritime Sphere with professionalism and pride.

Shri Rajnath Singh acknowledged that ICG has made an impact in its Area of Responsibility due to its omnipresence and commitment for ensuring safer seas for mariners. “Each successful mission resonates the efficiency of the officers and men and highlights the effective response capabilities of this service”, he said.

                Raksha Mantri added that apart from saving one precious life every second day at sea, Indian Coast Guard was actively involved in saving over 4,000 precious lives during recent flood disaster relief operation “Sahayata” in Coastal States of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. He said ICG also proved its prowess and reach by undertaking major fire-fighting operation onboard Merchant Ship Daniela off Colombo, Motor Tanker Genessa off Kandla and Merchant Vessel Maersk Honam on the fringes of Indian Search and Rescue Region and thus carved a niche among International Maritime community.

“The service created a Maritime history by seizing 1.5 Ton Heroin from Merchant Ship Henry, giving a setback to anti-national elements by averting misuse of funds that would have been generated from contraband. These are just a few of many such incidents wherein Indian Coast Guard has lived up to its reputation as ‘Sentinels of Sea’”, Shri Rajnath Singh added.

Listing out the measures being taken by the Government for President’sTatrakshak Medal and Tatrakshak Medals awardees, Raksha Mantri said a proposal to confer a scroll signed by the President of India for the awardees has been approved by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and is submitted to PMO. He also said a proposal for inclusion of ICG medals in Order of Precedence (OOP) is under consideration of MoD in consultation with Ministry of Home Affairs so that the awardees are not deprived of the desiring prestige and benefits.

Congratulating all the awardees at the ceremony, Shri Rajnath Singh lauded the tremendous courage and dedication to the nation they displayed under testing conditions. He hoped that the recognition further motivatesthe ICG personnel and they go the extra mile while discharging the mandate of the vibrant maritime force.

Earlier, Raksha Mantri conferred gallantry and meritorious service medals to ICG personnel. A totalof 61 awards includingone President’sTatrakshak Medals (Gallantry), eight President’sTatrakshak Medals (Distinguished Service), 32 Tatrakshak Medals (Gallantry) and 20 Tatrakshak Medals (Meritorious Service) were conferred to the ICG personnel by Raksha Mantri.

The President Tatrakshak Medals and Tatrakshak Medals are awarded as recognition to selfless devotion to duty, exemplary courage and acts of valour under extreme condition to the officers and men.

Director General Indian Coast Guard K Natarajan, senior officials of MoD and Indian Coast Guard were present on the occasion.

                1. The Sixth Reunion of the Corps of Army Air Defence was celebrated on 20 and 21 Sep 2019 at Army AD College, Gopalpur on Sea near Brahmapur in Odisha. 

2. The Corps of Army Air Defence is a relatively young arm. However in a short span of twenty five years since its bifurcation from the Regiment of Artillery, the Army Air Defence has already created a legacy for itself within the Indian Army. As sentinels of the skies, the Army Air Defence has proved its mettle in war, internal security duties and during natural calamities. 

3. The role of Army Air Defence in preserving strategic assets & key assets in the Tactical Battle Area of the nation assumes great significance in view of the emerging air threat. Army Air Defence will play a defining role in future conflicts and has thus taken a lead in induction of technologically sophisticated weapons and equipment besides selective upgradation of the existing equipment. 

4. The exploits of Army Air Defence warriors have earned the Corps numerous Gallantry & Distinguished Services awards incl two Ashoka Chakras, two Kirti Chakras, 20 Vir Chakras, nine Shaurya Chakras, 112 Sena Medals, one Medal of British Empire, seven India Distinguished Service Medal, two order of British Empire, 10 PVSMs, 22 AVSMs, and 44 VSMs in various operations including the 1947 Internal Disturbance, 1965 & 71 Indo-Pak Wars, besides operations in J & K, North Eastern states and the Siachin Glacier. In addition, four Army Air Defence units have been awarded the coveted Honour Titles in the 1971 War. 

5. The sixth Army Air Defence Reunion provided a platform for interaction among the serving and retired Army Air Defence gunners to renew their ties, pay tributes to their martyred comrades and to honour their Veer Naries. The celebrations included Wreath Laying at the War Memorial, a specially convened Sainik Sammelan for all ranks including veterans, felicitation of gallantry award winners and Veer Naris, display of transformation of Army Air Defence equipment profile, as also the traditional military gettogether over a Barakhana. A spectacular display of Army Air Defence history and heritage, Light and Sound Show at Army Air Defence Museum & Army Air Defence Band symphony were also organised to commemorate this occasion.

                Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik has called upon media to remain sensitive towards the national security while reporting about the developments related to the Armed Forces. Addressing the valedictory function of the Defence Correspondents’ Course (DCC) 2019 here today, Shri Shripad Naik said the duty of journalists is to encourage the soldiers who discharge their duties in extremely difficult conditions and are even prepared to make the supreme sacrifice in the service of the nation.

Raksha Rajya Mantri urged the journalists to act as a bridge between the government and the people which is vital for a country to prosper. He said, the Government’s mandate is to continuously strive for the welfare of the citizens and media’s duty is to inform the people of the Government’s policies & programmes. He reiterated that the government will make every possible effort for the betterment of the Armed Forces.

Congratulating the trainee journalists for successfully completing DCC 2019, Shri Shripad Naik hoped that the course provided a multi-dimensional perspective which will help them reach out to the people with an objective, in-depth and precise coverage of events and developments related to the Armed forces. “We wish to create a pool of skilled Defence journalists who understand the Armed Forces at all levels”, he added.

Raksha Rajya Mantri also gave away certificates and medallions to the trainee journalists on their successful completion of DCC 2019.

The participating media-persons thanked Directorate of Public Relations (DPR), Ministry of Defence for providing them with a unique opportunity to closely interact with senior officers of the Armed Forces, visit the forward locations and watch from close quarters the military equipment operated by the soldiers. They said the exposure they received during the course widened their perspective.

Shri Sitanshu Kar, Principal Director General, Press Information Bureau; Shri A Bharat Bhushan Babu, ADG (M&C), DPR and other senior officials of MoD were present on the occasion.

The Defence Correspondents’ Course (DCC), one of the most prestigious courses conducted by DPR, was held from August 26 – September 19, 2019. Thirty-two journalists drawn from all over the country underwent rigorous training in four modules – the Navy and Coast Guard leg in Mumbai; the Air Force leg in Chandigarh and Ambala; the Army leg in Jammu & Kashmir; and MoD leg in Delhi NCR.

                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully flight tested the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (BVRAAM) ‘Astra’ from Su-30 MKI platform off the coast of Chandipur, Odisha. The trials were held from 16th to 19th September 2019. The trials were conducted by Indian Air Force (IAF) against Jet Banshee target aircraft simulating all possible threat scenarios.

The five trials conducted during this period tested missiles in different configurations. During the campaign, three missiles were launched in combat configuration with warhead and manoeuvring targets were neutralized to establish the end game capability of the missile. The trial campaign also included a direct hit of the target by the telemetered missile at maximum range. All the subsystems performed accurately meeting all the mission parameters and objectives.

Astra BVRAAM has range of more than 100 kms with modern guidance and navigation techniques. The missile has midcourse guidance and RF seeker based terminal guidance to achieve target destruction with pin point accuracy.

The effort for building a state-of-the-art BVRAAM by DRDO, together with IAF has completed the user trial phase of the weapon system successfully. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has played a role in modifying the aircraft for weapon integration. More than 50 public and private industries have contributed in building the Astra weapon system.

The present flight trials have proved the end to end performance of the missile system in various combat scenarios giving greater confidence to users. The five successful trials of Astra will culminate into induction of the missile system into Indian Air Force, which will certainly be a force multiplier considering its accuracy and effectiveness in neutralizing aerial threats.

Dr G Satheesh Reddy, Secretary, Department of Defence R&D and Chairman, DRDO congratulated team ‘Astra’ for developing and flight testing such a formidable class of weapon system. The technologies developed under the programme will be the building blocks for development of future variants of Air-to-Air and Surface-to-Air Missiles.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO and IAF teams for the successful trials.

                            Soldiers from 5-20 Infantry Battalion of US Army and The Assam Regiment from the Indian Army concluded Exercise Yudh Abhyas – 2019 at Joint Base Lewis McChord (JBLM), Washington, USA on 18 September 2019.

            Yudh Abhyas - 2019 is an annual, US Army pacific sponsored Theatre Security Cooperation Program bilateral exercise designed to strengthen the US and Indian Army partnership. The training was focused on specialised drills and procedures involved in counter insurgency & counter terrorist operations in an urban environment. Helicopter based mobilisation of teams for quick response was also practiced. The initial days of field training comprised of platoon level training on basic manoeuvres, which then progressed towards company level operations.

            The soldiers organised into platoon sized teams, each team operating towards maintaining control of a town square or assaulting enemy targets in an urban environment at Seattle Town, which is a mock up town at JBLM used to simulate scenarios for possible deployment. The soldiers finished their tactical procedures by incorporating various lessons learned to successfully assault and eliminate enemy threats, seize the objective and evacuate causalities, during the culminating training event.

            The two Armies have gained from each other's expertise and experience in conduct of platoon and company level operations. In addition the lndian contingent got a first-hand experience of operating with the 'Stryker' Infantry Combat Vehicle and the US Army gained an insight on training of an infantry unit in mountainous terrain.

The training also included friendly games of cricket and football. A closing ceremony, to commemorate the proceedings of two weeks, showcased the flourishing partnership between the two nations.

                India needs more R&D, innovation and creation of cutting-edge technologies to become self-reliant in defence production, Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh said today while inaugurating the 7th edition of Engineers Conclave 2019 in Bengaluru. This year’s conclave is based on two themes, ‘Defence Technology & Innovation’ and ‘Transformation of Rural India Using Digital Technologies’.

Raksha Mantri said the Indian defence industry had not performed to its full potential in the past that led to the country’s overwhelming dependence on imported arms. He emphasised that developing critical and cutting-edge technologies indigenously will make the country self-sufficient, saving the precious foreign exchange, which could be utilised in other development activities in the country. He described continuous innovation as the key to success for any nation, given the fast pace at which technology becomes obsolete every passing day.

“It is well said that when nations go to war, the one with the best technology is most likely to win”, said Shri Rajnath Singh.

Stressing on the need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Defence, Shri Rajnath Singh said AI is capable of bringing significant transformations in the way future military operations would be conducted. He said the Government has already prepared a roadmap for making India a significant power of AI application in Defence.

Raksha Mantri emphasised on technology and innovation in the defence sector as it has enormous spin-off benefits for the masses as well.

Listing out the initiatives launched by the Government in this direction, Shri Rajnath Singh said Innovation for Defence Excellence (iDEX) scheme has been started to foster innovation and technology development in Defence and Aerospace by engaging Industries including MSMEs, Startups, Individual Innovators and R&D institutes. To encourage innovation, he said, ‘Make in India’ initiative has ensured that opportunities are given to MSMEs and Start-up companies. ‘Start-up India’ is providing a platform for conversion of new ideas into niche technology and its application, he added.

Reiterating the Government’s resolve to make India a USD five trillion economy by 2024 and subsequently USD 10 trillion by 2030, Raksha Mantri said defence is the major sector which has to contribute significantly towards realisation of this level of growth. He expressed hope to achieve a turnover of USD 26 billion in Aerospace and Defence goods & services by 2025, creating employment for nearly 2-3 million people.

On ‘Transformation of Rural India Using Digital Technologies’, Raksha Mantri said in his earlier tenures as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and Union Minister of Agriculture, he always tried to ensure that policies and programmes of the Government are formulated taking into account the concerns of rural India. He said rural transformation is the basic requirement for the overall development of India.

Raksha Mantri voiced the Government’s resolve of transforming the lives of farmers and people living in rural India. “The trinity of Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM) had been rightly emphasised by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to bring about this transformation”, he said.

Secretary, Department of Defence, R&D and Chairman DRDO, Dr G Satheesh Reddy, President, Indian National Academy of Engineering (INAE), Dr Sanak Mishra, and other officials of DRDO, ISRO, DPSUs, academia and industries were present at the inaugural function.

The ‘Engineers Conclave’ is being organised by INAE, in association with Navratna Defence PSU Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), from September 19-21, 2019, at the Bharat Electronics Academy for Excellence (BAE), Bengaluru.

                Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) called ‘Ship Builder to the Nation’, is one of India’s leading Defence public sector undertaking shipyards under the Ministry of Defencecontinuing their service to the nation with ‘’Make in India’’ programme. They delivered the second Scorpene submarine ‘KHANDERI’ to the Indian Navy at an event held in Mumbai today. The Acceptance Document was signed by Cmde Rakesh Anand, Chairman & Managing Director, MDL and RAdm B Sivakumar, Chief of Staff Officer (Tech), Western Naval Command in the presence of MDL Directors and Navy personnel at MDL.The submarine would soon be commissioned into the Indian Navy. It is a milestone event for MDL.

The submarine ‘KHANDERI’ is named after the wide snouted Saw fish, a deadly sea predator of the great Indian Ocean. The first Submarine Khanderi was commissioned into the Indian Navy on 06th December 1968 and decommissioned on 18th October 1989 after more than 20 years of yeoman service to the nation. In true nautical tradition, she will now be ‘reincarnated’ by MDL to guard the vast maritime area of our nation.

Building of the Scorpene was indeed a challenge for MDL, as the complexity of the simplest of tasks increased exponentially due to all work having to be done in the most congested of spaces. This complexity was further aggravated by the stringent tolerances required to be achieved. However, all of these challenges were accepted head-on and successfully overcome by MDL, without any compromise in quality whatsoever. 

The technology utilised in the Scorpene has ensured superior features of the submarine.

The Scorpene class of submarines can undertake multifarious tasks typically undertaken by any modern submarine which include anti-surface as well as
anti ­ submarine warfare.

With the delivery of Khanderi, India further cements its position as a submarine building nation and MDL has lived up to its reputation as one of the India’s leading shipyards with a capacity to meet requirements of the Indian Navy by the ""Indian commercial and warship building and ship repairing industry report"" released in Mumbai during March, 2018 by CRISIL.

The constructions of third Scorpene at MDL, KARANJ, was started on
31st January 2018, and is currently undergoing the rigorous phase of sea trials. The fourth Scorpene, VELA was recently launched in May 2019, and is being prepared for sea trials, whilst the remaining two submarines, VAGIR and VAGSHEER, are in various stages of outfitting. The Scorpene project would not have been achieved up to the current progress without the unconditional support and active encouragement of the Department of Defence Production (MoD).

It is also pertinent to mention that the two SSK submarines built by MDL in 1992 and 1994 are still serving Indian Navy, after more than 25 years. This is testimony to our skill and capability of MDL. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited also achieved expertise in submarine refits by successfully executing the medium refit-cum-upgradation of all the four SSK class submarines of the Indian Navy. lt is presently carrying out the medium refit and Life Certification of INS Shishumar, the first SSK submarine.

MDL has always been in the forefront of the nation's progressive indigenous warship building programme. In fact, with the construction of the Leander and Godavari class frigates, Khukri class Corvettes, Missile Boats, Delhi and Kolkata class Destroyers, Shivalik class Stealth Frigates, the SSK submarines and the first Scorpene submarine under its belt, the history of modernday MDL almost maps the history of indigenous warship building in India.

MDL's contribution to national security and nation building continues with the P-15B Visakhapatnam class Destroyers and the P-17A class Stealth Frigates.

Recognising the challenges of the future well in time, MDL has completed an extensive mordernisationprogramme, at the end of which, today it is building eight Warships, SIX Submarines, in its yard, which have four drydocks, three slipways, two Wet Basins and more than sixty thousand square metres of work shop area.

Leveraging the experience, the transfer-of-technology of theScorpeneproject, and with its enhanced and upgraded infrastructure, MDL is ready for undertaking construction of future submarines projects.

                Shri Rajnath Singh has scripted history by becoming the first Raksha Mantri to fly the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) ‘Tejas’. Shri Rajnath Singh undertook 30-minute sortie in the indigenously-built multi-role fighter aircraft with Air Vice Marshal Narmdeshwar Tiwari, at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Airport in Bengaluru this morning.

Raksha Mantri described his experience of flying the fourth-generation aircraft as ’thrilling and special’. Congratulating HAL, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) for building the multi-role fighter aircraft, Shri Rajnath Singh said demand has been received for ‘Tejas’ from different countries. He expressed pride that India has reached a stage where fighter aircraft and arms & ammunition can be exported to the world.

Raksha Mantri also praised the Indian Air Force as well as Army & Navy for their professionalism, courage and bravery. “I am proud of the soldiers of our Armed Forces”, he said.

Air Vice Marshal Narmdeshwar Tiwari said Raksha Mantri even controlled ‘Tejas’ in the air for some time and was shown the Avionics and Sophisticated Systems onboard the aircraft. He said “Shri Rajnath Singh was very happy with the quality and smoothness of the aircraft”.

Earlier, Shri Rajnath Singh was briefed about the functioning of the ‘Tejas’ by senior officials of Air Force.

Dr G Satheesh Reddy, Secretary, Department of Defence R&D and Chairman, DRDO; Shri R. Madhavan, CMD, HAL and other senior officials of DRDO and HAL were present on the occasion.

Tejas is a multi-role fighter with several critical capabilities. It is meant to strengthen India’s air defence capabilities.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has said the Government is committed to work towards achieving a USD 26 billion Defence industry by 2025. Addressing the second annual session of Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers here today, he said the Defence sector has been identified as one of the most prominent sectors under “Make in India” Initiative to realize USD 5 Trillion Economy by 2024.

Underlining the need to reduce dependency on arms imports, Raksha Mantri said several steps have been taken under the “Make in India” initiative to make the country a major Defence manufacturing hub and net Defence exporter. The Government would not hesitate to initiate more measures, if required, he added.

He said that the defense production policy reflects the resolve of the government to achieve USD 26 billion Defence industry with an anticipated investment of USD 10 Billion in aerospace and Defence goods and services by 2025. This will also provide employment to about 2-3 million people. He said, the government has introduced many far-reaching reforms in the past five and a half years to create an ecosystem where private and public sectors contribute together as per their respective strength and experience. The reforms have touched almost all aspects of Defence production and procurement, he added.

Raksha Mantri said that simplification of procedures for Defence Exports has resulted in export of Rs 10,745 Crore in 2018-19, which is nearly seven times the export achieved in 2016-17 and a target of USD 5 Billion for exports has been set till 2024.

Describing India as a big Defence industrial base, the Raksha Mantri said there are nine Defence Public Sector Units, 41 ordinance factories, 50 dedicated R & D labs and many other establishments are included in it. There are about 70 license holding private companies. They have a dedicated workforce of 1.7 lakhs people.

Shri Rajnath Singh said, the government has simplified industry licensing process, increased the FDI cap and taken necessary steps to promote Defence exports. He said, Defence offset policy has been streamlined and government owned trial and testing facility has been provided to private sector. Two Defence industrial corridors have been launched in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.

Elaborating the Government’s initiatives to promote Start-Ups and MSMEs, the Minister said that at present over 8000 MSMEs are engaged in Defence production. Efforts are on to double this figure to 16,000.

Under the “Make” procedure, till date 40 industry development proposals have been given in principle approval. Eight such projects would have an estimated value of Rs 2,000 Crore in next five years. As against 215 Defence licenses issued till 2014, the number of Defence licenses issued went up to 440 by March 2019, he added.

Shri Rajnath Singh said Defence Procurement Procedure was revised in 2016 to stimulate the growth of domestic Defence industry. A new category ‘Buy {Indian-IDDM (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured’)} was introduced to promote indigenous design and development of Defence equipments. He said in recent times most of the capital procurement approvals by the Defence Acquisition Council were given under indigenous development and production.

Shri Rajnath Singh further said that strategic partnership model has been introduced in Defence Procurement Procedure to ensure that private sector manufactures big-ticket items like Fighter Aircraft, Helicopters, Submarines and armored vehicles. This will help Indian private companies to evolve into global giants in coming years.

Underscoring the symbiotic relationship between innovation and enterprises to flourish manufacturing in today’s fast moving world, Shri Rajnath Singh said that Innovation for Defence Excellence (IDEX) has been launched to promote innovation and technology development.  
44 winners have been chosen in 14 projects under two defence innovation Start-up Challenges (DISC).

Referring to the strong IT industry of the country, Shri Rajnath Singh said that a road map has been prepared to promote Artificial Intelligence in national security to make India a significant power in Defence AI. It has been planned to develop 25 Defence Specific AI products by 2024.

The Raksha Mantri said that steps are being taken to make defence manufacturing sector self-reliant and a new Transfer of Technology (ToT) policy is under process that will pave the path of transferring DRDO developed technologies to the industry. A new policy on the use of DRDO patents by the industry is under consideration to promote and motivate Defence industry for innovation. He mentioned that till now over 900 ToT licencing agreements have been signed with the industry which is a major step towards making Defence manufacture sector self-reliant.

Shri Rajnath Singh assured the Defence Manufactures of all possible support from the Government. He said that the government is open to new ideas and is committed to fully harness the energies, entrepreneurship spirit and enterprise of private sector in the defence sector.

I am happy that the Subroto Cup International Football Tournament this year has seen participation from 09 international teams. I take this opportunity to congratulate the winning teams and for the others my wishes are that they come back stronger next year to become victorious.”

The team rode for 1505 km and scaled eight of the world’s highest passes across the strenuous and treacherous terrain of Ladhakh region, a feat which has not been achieved before in a single expedition.

Army Medical Corps, since its inception has been taking part in operations and providing medical support to our valiant soldiers deployed in arduous terrain, be it the world’s highest battlefield in Siachen Glacier, the harsh deserts of Rajasthan or the dense and most inhospitable jungles of North-East. The Medical Officers as well as Medical Assistants from the Corps have actively participated in various expeditions within the country as well as overseas, including in United Nation Peacekeeping Operations and have excelled in their role as life saviours.

The expedition, which was flagged off by Lt Gen YK Joshi, GOC Fire & Fury Corps on Aug 31, 2019 rode through eight of the world’s highest passes namely, Khardung La (5359m/17582 ft), Saser La (5411m/17753ft), Wari La (5312m/17428ft), Chang La (5360m/17586ft), Marsimek La (5582m/18314ft), Kaksang La (5438m/ 17841ft), Photi La (5524m/18124ft) and Taglang La (5328m/17480ft) in that order. During their quest to conquer the mighty Karakoram, Kailash and Ladakh ranges, the team also paid their tribute to the gallant martyrs Indian Army by visiting Siachen Base Camp. The 8-member expedition team from Army Medical Corps was led by Team Leader Col Rajesh W Adhau, SM, a mountaineer and Gallentry Award winer in Kargil War with Col Saurabh Bhardwaj as Deputy Team Lleader. The team members were: Maj Mahesh Mahto, Maj Sashikant, Capt Karanvir Sidhu, Hav Vinayak Dhamle, LNk Pinto Dash, LNk DK Singh.

The expedition flag will be handed over to Lt Gen Anup Banerjee SM, PHS, DGMS (Army) at Ayurvigyan Auditorium, R& R hospital in presence of Lt Gen Bipin Puri, PVSM, VSM, PHS, Director General Armed Forces Medical Services and Senior Col Comdt as a Chief Guest. This unique effort would not only imbibe the ‘esprit de corps’ and spirit of adventure amongst all ranks of the Indian Army but has also showcased the tough and robust face of Army Medical Corps warriors.

                A maiden trilateral exercise, involving Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN), Royal Thailand Navy (RTN) and Indian Navy (IN) has commenced at Port Blair on 16 Sep 19. The five-day-long exercise is aimed at bolstering the maritime inter-relationships amongst Singapore Thailand and India, and contribute significantly to enhancing the overall maritime security in the region. This would also strengthen the mutual confidence amongst three navies in terms of interoperability and development of a common understanding of procedures.



Under the ambit of this exercise, RSN Tenacious, a Formidable-class guided missile stealth frigate and His Majesty's Thailand Ship (HTMS) Kraburi, a Guided Missile Frigate would be exercising with Indian Naval Ships Ranvir, a Guided Missile Destroyer, Kora, a missile corvette and Sukanya, an Offshore Patrol Vessel along with P8I Long Range Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft. During the harbour phase scheduled at Port Blair, professional exchanges, sports fixtures and cross deck familiarisation visits would be organised. The sea phase scheduled from 18 Sep to 20 Sep 19, a host of surface and air operations involving Gunnery, Force Protection Measures and Communication drills would be conducted providing experience gaining and learning from each other's best practices. 

 

Besides fostering co-operation, the maiden IN-RSN-RTN Trilateral exercise would provide an opportunity to participating navies to come together in a spirit of collaboration to nurture stronger ties.

                            In continuation of the Indian Navy’s overseas deployment to Africa, Europe and Russia, Indian Naval Ship Tarkash made a port call at Walvis Bay, Namibia today, on 15 Sep 19 for a three days visit. The port call by INS Tarkash at Walvis Bay is a demonstration of India’s warm ties with Namibia and its commitment to enhance operational reach, maritime security and its solidarity with friendly nations.

            INS Tarkash commanded by Captain Sathish Vasudev, is a state of the art warship of the Indian Navy equipped with a versatile range of weapons and sensors capable of addressing threats in all the three dimensions. The ship is part of the Indian Navy’s Western Fleet and is under the operational Command of Flag Officer Commanding –in –Chief, Western Naval Command, based at Mumbai.

            During the visit, the Commanding Officer of the ship will pay courtesy calls on Namibian dignitaries and senior defence officers, including the Chief of the Namibian Navy. Professional interactions are planned with the Namibian Navy towards further enhancing co-operation between the two forces. In addition, social engagements, exchange visit of ships, sports event and sharing of best practices are also organised. 

            India and Namibia have enjoyed warm and friendly bilateral relations sharing common values of democracy, development and secularism. A number of bilateral arrangements for co-operation and military exchange exist between the two countries. As part of its defence cooperation, India, over the years, has extended training to a large number of Namibian military officers in various military institutions.

            Indian Navy ships are regularly deployed as part of Indian Navy’s mission of building ‘bridges of friendship’ and strengthening international cooperation with friendly countries as well as to address maritime concerns across the globe. The current visit seeks to accentuate India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly countries and, in particular, to strengthen the existing bonds of friendship between India and Namibia.

                Today, Air Force Record Office (AFRO) celebrated 80th anniversary of  it's formation with ceremonial fervour at Subroto Park, New Delhi. Senior serving and retired officers were present to celebrate the event.

The Air Officer Commanding AFRO, Air Commodore AR Shendye VM delivered a performance status report as a prelude to the ceremony. He also gave a gist of the events being undertaken to commemorate the event. The activities included inauguration of the AFRO History Cell and Museum by Air Vice Marshal GS Bedi VM VSM, Assistant Chief of Air Staff (PO), a Musical Evening being graced by Air Vice Marshal S Ravi Vridhachalem VM VSM, Assistant Chief of Air Staff (PA&C), Mini Sports Olympiad, Walkathon (for ladies), Marathon (for men), Painting Competition (for children), Cycling Expedition, Tree Plantation and Blood Donation Camp.

The highlight of the evening would be the release of a Coffee Table Book titled ‘AFRO Through the Ages’ by Air Marshal RaghunathNambiar PVSM AVSM VM & Bar ADC, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Air Command.

The AFRO can justifiably take pride in being one of the oldest IAF formations. After its formation as IAF Record Office at Ambala in 1939, it changed several locations such as Lahore in 1941, Bombay in 1942, Madras in 1946 and New Delhi in 1947 before finding its permanent location at Subroto Park in 1966. During its eight decades of existence, its growth has been closely interlinked with that of the IAF. Initially handling the end to end HR management of only 14100 Hawai Sepoys in 1947, today it has grown into a mammoth institution looking after nearly 1,43,000 Air Warriors. Its aim now is to automate all manual processes and reduce paper movement between outlying field units and AFRO, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability. The skilled and dedicated personnel of ‘Team AFRO’ follow the IAF tenet of “Mission, Integrity & Excellence” in the discharge of their duties so that the IAF touches the sky with glory.

                Royal Thai Navy Ship HTMS Kraburi, a Guided Missile Frigate commanded by Capt Bunpot Jaibunjong and a Naval Maritime Patrol Dornier aircraft of the 3rd Naval Area Command, Royal Thailand Navy, arrived at Port Blair today, on 13 September 2019 for the closing ceremony of the 28th cycle of the Indo-Thailand Coordinated Patrol (INDO-THAI CORPAT). Commodore R Vinod Kumar, officiating Naval Component Commander, Andaman & Nicobar Command, welcomed the RTN delegation led by Rear Admiral Wittanarat Gajaseni, Deputy Commander, 3rd Naval Area Command. The Planning Conference for the CORPAT was conducted on 05 September 2019 at Phuket, Thailand.

Indian Naval Ship Kesari, an amphibious Landing Ship Tank (Large), commanded by Commander Mukesh Tayal, along with Indian Naval Maritime Patrol Dornier aircraft, participated from the Indian Navy. During the sea phase of the CORPAT from 06 to 12 September 2019, units of both the navies undertook coordinated maritime patrolling in their respective sectors of the International Maritime Boundary Line. In addition, the participating ships and aircraft undertook joint exercises including Ship Boarding operations, Search and Rescue exercise, coordinated maneuvers at sea, etc. Upon arrival at Port Blair, Rear Admiral Wittanarat Gajaseni along with RTN delegates called on Maj Gen Beji Mathews, Chief of Staff at Headquarters Andaman and Nicobar Command. The subsequent programme includes debrief of the sea phase, sports fixtures, local sightseeing and professional interaction between naval personnel of both the nations.

Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region. In addition, the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with EEZ Surveillance, Search and Rescue and other capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment is in consonance with Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate     inter-operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas. 

The 28th cycle of Indo-Thai CORPAT seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly and harmonious countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and to strengthen existing bonds between India and Thailand.

                Today is a golden letter day in the history of Indian Naval Aviation.

Today, the First ever arrested landing of LCA (Navy) at the shore-based test facility, INS Hansa Goa took place which will pave the way for this Indigenous platform to undertake Aircraft Carrier landing demonstration on board the Indian Naval Aircraft Carrier, Vikramaditya.

After several years of flight testing and four campaigns of dedicated testing at Shore Based Test facility Goa, today the LCA (Navy) Flight Test Team led by Cmde J A Maolankar (Chief Test Pilot), CaptShivnath Dahiya (LSO) & Cdr J D Raturi (Test Director) successfully executeda text book arrested landing at the Shore Based Test Facility, INS Hansa, Goa. This arrested landing heralds the arrival of true indigenous capability and displays the professional prowess of our scientific community Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) embedded with design and build capability of HAL(ARDC), DRDO and CSIR Labs involved in executing this land mark event.

This event marks the start of a new era where multiple agencies have come together to achieve a common goal. The participation of Certification Agency (CEMILAC), Quality Agency (DGAQA) and above all the men and women on the ground who serviced the aircraft and monitored it during strenuous trails is truly commendable. The support of Indian Navy through the Navy Project office and DAPM at IHQ MoD Navy is noteworthy.

Today’s event has put India on the world map as a nation with the capability to design a deck landing aircraft.

Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh congratulated ADA, HAL, DRDO and Indian Navy for this major feat.

                 As part of Indian Navy's Overseas Deployment to South East Asia and  Western Pacific, Indian Navy ships Sahyadri and Kiltan made a port call at Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia today, for three days visit from 12 – 15 Sep 19. The ships are part of the Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command under the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command, based at Visakhapatnam. The port call is a demonstration of India's warm ties with Malaysia. 



IN Ships Sahyadri and Kiltan, operating under the Command of Rear Admiral Suraj Berry, Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet, are the latest, indigenously designed and built multi-role ships of the Indian Navy. The two ships are equipped with a versatile array of weapons and sensors, can carry multi-role helicopters and represent the ‘coming of age’ of India’s warship building capabilities. 

 

During the port call, the Indian Navy and the Royal Malaysian Navy would be participating in the bilateral exercise Samudra Laksamana. The exercise would include a harbour phase wherein professional interactions, official calls, social engagements, visits by the local populace and various sports events would be conducted. The Sea Phase of the exercise would enable the two navies to further hone their skills in order to enhance interoperability between the navies to ensure peaceful and secure seas for all. 

 

The visit of the IN ships would further bolster the strong bonds of friendship between the two countries and contribute to the security and stability in the region.

                The white water Rafting Expedition christened 'RUDRASHILA' being undertaken by Kalidhar Battalion under the aegis of Battle Axe Division was Flagged Off on 11 September 2019 at Jaisalmer Military station by Major General T K Aich, General Officer Commanding Battle Axe Division.

The expedition christened 'Rudrashila' has been organised to commemorate the 75th Raising day of the Kalidhar Battalion. 'Rudrashila' takes its name from the famed Rudraprayag tributary of the Ganges River in the Mountains of Uttarakhand. 'Kalidhar Batttalion' was raised on 01 November 1943 and has participated in all major operations of the Indian Army including two overseas assignments in Korea in 1953 and UN peacekeeping Mission in Congo in 2005-06.

The expedition team led by Major Ravi Kant Gaurav comprising of two Officers, Four Junior Commissioned Officers and 18 Soldiers will  cover a total distance of 140 kilometers from Rudraprayag to Rishikesh over some of the most difficult and dangerous rapids in mighty Ganges River. The expedition will be conducted from 01 October to 04 October 2019.

Major General Tarun Kumar Aich expressed that such expeditions display the spirit of adventure, team work, leadership and ability to discharge operational tasks under stress, which are bed rock of Indian Army. He also highlighted the need to spread awareness towards ' Preservation of River Eco-system' in line with the 'Namami Gange Initiative' as well as tremendous potential for water sports and eco-tourism which would provide a sustainable source of income to the locals.

The General Officer concluded by lauding the expedition team for the exceptional rafting experience gained over past few months through training at various Army aqua nodes and wished them success for the expedition.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has called upon the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) of SCO countries to devise ways to effectively deal with new threats posed to soldiers by the ever advancing battle field technology. Inaugurating the first ever conference of Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) Countries on Military Medicine here today, Shri Rajnath Singh said the threat of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare adds to the complexity of the existing challenges and AFMS plays a vital role in identifying those challenges, defining the limits of human tolerance and suggesting strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects.

Raksha Mantri also underlined the importance of building capabilities to deal with the menace of bio-terrorism, terming it as a real threat the world is facing today. He described bio-terrorism as a “contagious plague” and asked the armed forces to be at the forefront of combating the menace.

Raksha Mantri asked AFMS to have a clear, effective and rehearsed protocol with respect to casualty management strategies. He said the protocols and strategies need to be devised taking into account not just the peculiarities of the operating environment and the nature of operations, but also competence and capabilities of AFMS.

Shri Rajnath Singh also suggested co-operation among countries during disasters to ensure that timely assistance reaches those in need even across international borders. He said the scale of magnitude of destruction following disasters can often overwhelm the resources and relief efforts of a nation and the medical services of Armed Forces form a vital component of humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations.

Identifying “Patient Safety” as another area which needs to be further strengthened, Shri Rajnath Singh stressed on the need for awareness on healthy practices of patient safety that will greatly enhance the combat effectiveness of military services. “Patient safety does not end at making correct diagnosis and prescribing correct medication. Dispensing that prescribed medicine to the correct patient via the correct method plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of patients”, he said.

Raksha Mantri said SCO is the “alliance of the East”, due to its growing centrality in Asia-Pacific and described it as the primary security pillar in the region. He said SCO is the largest regional organisation in the world in terms of geographical coverage and population. “SCO countries cover 22 per cent of the land mass, 40 per cent population and contribute to 20 per cent of world’s GDP”, Shri Rajnath Singh said. He said India has been making positive contribution to SCO and actively participated in EX PEACE MISSION in Russia. Currently an Indian contingent is participating in EX CENTRE 2019 in Russia along with other SCO partners. The military exercises are conducted among members regularly to promote co-operation against terrorism and other external threats, he added.

In his address, Chiefs of Staff Committee and Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said, evolving technology translates into more and more complex casualties and therefore, it is imperative that AFMS keeps pace with technology and expertise.

Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to Chairman, Chief of Staff Committee, Lt Gen P. S. Rajeshwar said India decided to host the conference as it understands that wellness is an important component in maintaining effectiveness and efficiency of a soldier. He said there is a need to enhance co-operation and build capacities so that common challenges faced by all nations can be overcome jointly.

Chair SCO, Major Gen Krainyuko Pavel Yevgeniyevich of Russia hoped that this conference will significantly improve international cooperation in military medicine.

Director General, AFMS, Lt Gen Bipin Puri, Deputy Chief Integrated Defence Service (Medical) Air Marshal Rakesh Kumar Ranyal, delegates from SCO Member states and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                An Indian Army sponsored Capacity Building Tour comprising of 22 students and three teachers of Kishtwar District of Jammu and Kashmir returned to Batote after a ten-days tour which included visit to New Delhi and Indian Military Academy, Dehradun. The team was flagged-in at Batote on 11 Sep 2019 amidst a rousing welcome in a befitting ceremony.

Over the period of ten days i.e from 02 Sep to 11 Sep 2019, the budding youth of Kishtwar District were exposed to a unique experience which entailed visit to premier military institution such as Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, icons of historical legacy such as the Rashtrapati Bhawan, India Gate, & National War Memorial and scientific establishments such as Science Meseum, Nehru Planetarium and Forest Research Institute. 

The main attraction of the visit was tour to Indian Military Academy where in the students and teachers witnessed the Gentleman Cadet’s training activities and world class infrastructure available in the Academy. The tour team was also taken to Khetarpal Auditorium of the academy and was shown “Making of Warrior” movie to motivate the young boys to join Indian Armed Forces. The team also interacted with dignitaries of the Indian Army during their voyage with an overall aim to instill self-confidence and motivate them for a bright future.

 The visit also focused on exposing the students to the career opportunities available in the Indian Army as well as Government Sector wherein the students were made to visit the much famed Baalnoi Academy which prepares students for competitive exams including Services Selection Board for entry as officers in the Army.

The visit also incorporated leisure slots which included Metro Train Ride, visit to Select City Mall, Musoorie Town and to a Movie theater which was a thrilling experience for the boys who were never exposed to cosmopolitan cities. The students were amazed and motivated after watching ‘Mission Mangal’ Movie.

The students and teachers were bubbling with eagerness to share their experiences and knowledge gained during the tour with others in their Schools and villages. They thanked Indian Army for organising the tour which provided them a unique opportunity to broaden their horizon.

 Indian Army has been regularly conducting such tours for students from remote regions of Jammu and Kashmir.

                India and Republic of Korea (ROK) have formulated a forward looking roadmap to take bilateral Defence Industry co-operation to the next level, Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh said today while addressing CEOs of Korean and Indian Defence Industries in Seoul, in the presence of Minister of Defence Acquisition and Program Administration, ROK, Mr Wang Jung-hong. Raksha Mantri said the roadmap has listed a number of proposed areas of co-operation in sectors of Land Systems, Aero Systems, Naval Systems, R&D co-operation and collaboration in Testing, Certification and Quality Assurance.

Shri Rajnath Singh invited the Korean Industry to explore the feasibility of local production of items, used in main weapon system, imported by Indian Defence PSUs. He proposed setting up of a task force which identifies such items which are economically viable and locally produced in India resulting in reduction of import bill.

“India offers tremendous business opportunity to Korean defence industries in India with liberalised licencing regime, attractive FDI provisions, strong and skilled industrial work force, single window clearances and establishment of Defence Investor Cell to facilitate investors and various other industry friendly initiatives”, said Shri Rajnath Singh.

Raksha Mantri also invited a delegation from Korean Defence Industries to participate in DefExpo 2020 which will be held from 05 - 08 February, 2020 in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. He also took note of the MoU being entered into to facilitate participation of large OEMs, MSMEs and Korean Industries in various Defence Exhibitions in India. “Attractive discounts can also be offered to such companies who come forward to participate in Def Expo 2020”, he added.

Shri Rajnath Singh expressed confidence that India and ROK will seize the opportunity for a win-win situation by collaboration, cooperation, co-production and co-development. He assured the Korean Industry that the Indian Government will take all necessary steps to facilitate investment and joint ventures.

Earlier, the CEO Forum was given detailed information about India’s initiatives to attract investments in Indian Defence Corridors from ROK’s defence industries. The Forum was jointly organised by Embassy of Indian and Department, Defence Production, Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Secretary (Defence Production) Shri Subhash Chandra, Defence Secretary Dr Ajay Kumar, Indian Ambassador in ROK, Smt Sripriya Ranganathan and other senior officials of India and ROK were present on the occasion.

The senior government officials and industry leaders of both sides also held Business-to-Government (B2G) meeting in which they explained various investment opportunities available in defence corridors in Uttar Pradesh & Tamil Nadu and the upcoming DefExpo 2020.

Later, Raksha Mantri addressed the captains of Indian and RoK Defence Industry at the reception given by Indian Embassy in Seoul. He assured the South Korean Industry leaders that the Government will facilitate investments in India’s Defence corridors and extend all incentives and concessions as per the policy. He said those companies can have easy access to markets in other countries in the region.

“We are progressing towards becoming a manufacturing hub of defence equipment and investors can use India as a spring board to export defence equipment manufactured in India to various friendly countries in South East Asia, Middle Asia, Middle East Asia, South Asia and Africa”, added Shri Rajnath Singh.

Raksha Mantri expressed happiness that the defence relations between India and ROK have expanded in recent years, spurred by a convergence of strategic interests and shared mutual goodwill. He said Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and President of Republic of Korea, Mr Moon Jae-in share a close bond which has infused the relationship with a greater sense of purpose. “Under its ‘Act East Policy’, India considers ROK an indispensable partner for co-operation. We are also conscious of the fact that ROK aims to cement its bilateral relations with India further through the “New Southern Policy”, said Shri Rajnath Singh.

Raksha Mantri also took the opportunity to express his happiness on ISRO’s Chandrayan – 2 Mission which is scheduled to land on the Moon. He said the achievement is an embodiment of India’s technical expertise, capability of Scientific and technological community that the country can deliver. He termed it is as the most economical voyage ever undertaken by a Space Agency of any country.

Shri Rajnath Singh concluded by saying that his visit to ROK was highly satisfying. He expressed confidence that the visit will further cement the relationship in defence co-operation between India and ROK.

US and Indian soldiers stood side by side, and gave a ceremonial salute to the two senior most officers of the US and Indian side reviewing the ceremony. 

          The US contingent was represented by a company of 5-20 Infantry Battalion of the US Army while the Indian side was representing  The Assam Regiment. Major General Xavier Brunsen, US Army welcomed the Indian soldiers, and in his inaugural remarks highlighted the common shared beliefs of democracy, freedom, equality and justice that are precious to both nations.

Experts from both sides will also hold detailed discussions to share their experience on varied topics for mutual benefit.

                28th edition of India-Thailand Coordinated Patrol (Indo-Thai CORPAT) between the Indian Navy (IN) and the Royal Thai Navy (RTN) is being conducted from 05 – 15 September 2019. Indian Naval (IN) Ship Kesari and His Majesty’s Thailand Ship (HTMS) Kraburi along with Maritime Patrol Aircraft from both the navies are participating in the CORPAT. 

 

IN ships and aircraft of Andaman and Nicobar Command have been participating in the biannual Coordinated Patrol (CORPAT) with the Royal Thai Navy (RTN) since 2003. The Objectives of the Indo-Thai CORPAT are to ensure effective implementation of United Nations Conventions on Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS) which specify regulations regarding protection and conservation of natural resources, conservation of marine environment, prevention and suppression of illegal, unregulated fishing activity/ drug trafficking/ piracy, exchange of information in prevention of smuggling, illegal immigration and conduct of Search and Rescue operations at sea.

 

IN Dornier along with aircrew arrived at Bangkok, Thailand on 05 Sep 19 for Single Planning conference for the 28th cycle of Indo-Thai CORPAT. Detailed discussions were held towards scheduling and conduct of the CORPAT along with joint exercises between ships/ aircraft of both the navies. 

 

The 28th cycle of Indo-Thai CORPAT is poised to further enhance strong bilateral ties and maritime cooperation between India and Thailand. The CORPAT is truly reflective of the strong desire for a peaceful Indian Ocean safeguarded through good maritime order in the region.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has called for a collective international action to check perpetrators of terrorism and advocated strong measures against those who support and finance terrorism and provide sanctuary to terrorists.

 

Delivering a keynote address at the ‘Seoul Defence Dialogue 2019’ with the theme, ‘Building Peace Together: Challenges and Vision’, during his visit to Republic of Korea (ROK), Raksha Mantri said “of the numerous security challenges that the world is facing, the gravest is that of terrorism.” No country in the world is safe from terrorism and India has been actively pursuing counter terrorism cooperation bilaterally, regionally and globally through UN and other fora, he added.

 

Shri Rajnath Singh said, world politics today is in a state of flux and this has aggravated global and regional challenges to international peace and security. He added that new and emerging technologies have impacted the regional as well as global security environment. “Our region is confronted with numerous traditional and non-traditional security threats such as terrorism, conflicts, transnational crimes, maritime threats, proliferation as well as the challenges of sustainable development, including the lack of energy, low intra-regional trade and lack of connectivity”, he said.

 

Raksha Mantri emphasised that good relations with neighbours – both immediate and extended – are a priority for India’s foreign policy as part of its Neighbourhood First Policy. “A key feature of India’s Neighbourhood First Policy is also its engagement with its neighbours in sub-regional groupings of Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and Bay of Bengal initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), apart from a trilateral maritime co-operation format with Sri Lanka and Maldives to improve Maritime Domain Awareness and co-operation”, he added.

 

 

Shri Rajnath Singh expressed India’s support for peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and its denuclearisation through dialogue and diplomacy. “Our quest for common prosperity and security requires us to evolve a common rules-based order for our region, the Indo-Pacific region. This order must be based on sovereignty and territorial integrity and equality of all nations, irrespective of size and strength. These rules and norms must be based on the consent of all”, he said.

 

Raksha Mantri said, India has strengthened co-operative engagements in the Indo-Pacific region on the basis of the principle of “SAGAR – Security and Growth for All in the Region”, a principle that remains the cornerstone of India’s outlook for the Indo-Pacific region. He advocated for an open and inclusive architecture for the Indo-Pacific region with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) centrality, equal access to the global commons, freedom of navigation in the seas and in the air and unimpeded commerce, the importance of connectivity, a rules-based order and dialogue as the means to resolve disputes.

 

Shri Rajnath Singh said Asia can make 21st century as century of peace and holistic development, where the nations can tackle the common challenges of poverty, disease, illiteracy and terrorism. He stressed the five principles of Indian thought –Samman (respect), Samvad (dialogue), Sahayog (cooperation), Shanti (peace) and Samriddhi (prosperity) - to achieve this goal.

 

Raksha Mantri said India and ROK play a stellar role in bringing about peace, progress, prosperity, riding on twin pillars of economic and security partnership. He said, bilateral co-operation can be instrumental in the following:


	Ensuring rules-based order in the region;
	Fighting terrorism, piracy, proliferation and transnational crimes;
	Collaboration on issues such as HADR, Cyber Security and other maritime related threats;
	Seek to align and coordinate regional maritime capacity building/security assistance efforts.


Shri Rajnath Singh termed as ‘spectacular’ the progress made by ROK over the past few decades saying that it has been a source of inspiration for India. He added that the synergy between India’s ‘Act East Policy’ and Korea’s ‘New Southern Policy’ has further strengthened Special Strategic Partnership between the two countries.

 

It may be noted that India has been among the first responders in Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) situations in the region, from Fiji to Yemen. Recently, the Indian Navy conducted HADR operations in the aftermath of Cyclone IDAI that hit Mozambique in March this year.

                In the second leg of his two-nation tour to Japan and South Korea, Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh arrived in Seoul today from Tokyo.

He met Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea (RoK), Mr. Lee Nak-Yon and had a comprehensive interaction over a wide range of issues pertaining to bilateral ties between India and Republic of Korea. Shri Singh said that India and RoK are natural partners with many complementarities, while stressing that RoK’s ‘New Southern Policy’ and India’s ‘Act East Policy’ will provide a strong framework for future engagement and consolidation of Special Strategic Partnership between the two countries.

                Today, the IAF formally inducted the AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopter into its inventory at Air Force Station Pathankot. Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa PVSM AVSM YSM VM ADC, Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee and Chief of the Air Staff was the Chief guest at the event.

Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa during the induction ceremony said “Apache attack helicopters are being purchased to replace the Mi-35 fleet. Alongside the capability to shoot fire and forget anti tank guided missiles, air to air missiles, rockets and other ammunitions, it also has modern EW capabilities to provide versatility to helicopter in a network centric aerial warfare. Apaches have been an integral part of numerous historic campaigns worldwide. These aircraft have been modified specifically to suit the exacting standards demanded by IAF. I am happy to note that the delivery schedule is on time with eight helicopters already being delivered.”

IAF has signed a contract with ‘The Boeing Company’ and US Government for 22 Apache Attack Helicopters. The first eight helicopters have been delivered on schedule and the last batch of helicopters is to be delivered by March 2020. These helicopters will be deployed in the Western regions of India.

The helicopter is capable of delivering variety of weapons which include air to ground Hellfire missiles, 70 mm Hydra rockets and air to air Stinger missiles. Apache also carries one 30 mm chain gun with 1200 rounds as part of area weapon sub system. To add to the lethality of the helicopter, it carries fire control radar, which has a 360° coverage and nose mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and night vision systems.

The addition of Apache Attack Helicopter is a significant step towards modernisation of Indian Air Force helicopter fleet. This procurement will enhance the capability of IAF in providing integrated combat aviation cover to the army strike corps. These tandem seating helicopters are day/night, all weather capable and have high agility and survivability against battle damage. These are easily maintainable even in field conditions and are capable of prolonged operations in tropical and desert regions.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh co-chaired the Japan – India Defence Ministerial Meeting with Defence Minister of Japan Mr Takeshi lwaya in Tokyo today. The dialogue discussed various issues of mutual concern including ways to further strengthen the existing bilateral co-operative arrangements and adopt new initiatives towards achieving peace and security in the region.

The lndo-Pacific vision was discussed at length with an expression of India's preference for a rules-based order along with centrality of Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and inclusiveness and security for all. The importance of the Special Strategic and Global Partnership between India and Japan in addressing regional peace, security and stability was also highlighted. Furthermore, the two Ministers had free and frank discussion on the emerging regional security scenario.

Raksha Mantri also discussed abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian constitution and said talks and cross-border terrorism originating from Pakistan cannot go together. He invited participation of Japanese companies and other stakeholders at biennial DefExpo 2020 to be held in Lucknow. In a tweet Shri Rajnath Singh said, “Had an extremely fruitful Ministerial Level Dialogue with Japan’s Defence Minister, Mr Takeshi Iwaya in Tokyo. We discussed the full spectrum of India-Japan defence cooperation. We will continue working together to further deepen the defence ties between both the nations.”

Later, Shri Rajnath Singh called on Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Shinzo Abe. During the meeting, Raksha Mantri praised the exceptional relationship between Mr Shinzo Abe and Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Raksha Mantri apprised the Japanese Prime Minister on the contents of the discussion at the Defence Ministerial Dialogue.

Shri Rajnath Singh also conveyed to the Prime Minister of Japan that Jammu & Kashmir is an integral part of India and abrogation of Article 370 benefits the people of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. He also said Pakistan has no locus standi in Jammu & Kashmir.

There was a general understanding that more co-operation should be realised in Defence Equipment and Technology Co-operation. Prime Minister Mr Abe requested Raksha Mantri to convey his regards to Prime Minister Shri Modi whom he expects to meet on the sidelines of UNGA in New York later this month. Raksha Mantri tweeted after his interaction with PM Abe, “The meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan Mr Shinzo Abe was excellent. India attaches the highest priority to our bilateral relationship with Japan. I conveyed to him the Government of India’s commitment to further enhance the defence engagements between both the countries.”

Earlier, Shri Rajnath Singh paid homage to the martyrs of Japanese Self-Defence Forces at Ichigaya in Tokyo. He also inspected the Guard of Honour at Ministry of Defence Headquarters, Japan.

                The Navy and Coast Guard leg of the 2019 edition of the Defence Correspondents Course (DCC) concluded at Mumbai on 31 Aug 19.  The course was conducted at Western Naval Command, Mumbai and coordinated by the Maritime Warfare Centre (Mumbai). The course aimed to enlighten journalists on nuances of naval operations and their significance and in the long run build a pool of journalists who understand the Armed Forces.

 

During the Navy and Coast Guard phase of a week, which started on 26 Aug, over the first three days, the DCC participants were apprised on organisation, roles and responsibility of the Navy, Coast Guard and the Naval Value System. They visited the Naval Dockyard Mumbai and were also taken for the Heritage Walk around the dockyard. The course also visited frontline submarines and warships of Indian Navy as well as the Coast Guard. A visit to the Joint Operations Centre (JOC) and a brief on the coastal security construct brought the participants up to speed on the nuances and workings of the coastal defence mechanism. 

 

The highlight of the course, in their own words, was the one-day sea sortie on a frontline frigate of the Navy, INS Brahmaputra. A few participants even had the opportunity to participate in naval activities being conducted at sea.

The naval leg culminated with a valedictory reception hosted by the Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet (FOCWF) for the participants and the organisers where the understanding and bonhomie between the teachers and the students made it clear that the naval leg was successful in its primary task. The DCC now moves to Chandigarh for the phase with the Indian Air Force.

                The Union Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) Dr. Jitendra Singh inaugurated the Cane and Bamboo Technology Park-cum-Office Premises of Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre (CBTC) at Burnihat, Assam today.  

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Singh said that there are many unexplored potentials in North East and one of them is bamboo, as more than 50% of India’s bamboos are found in this region. The Minister further said though the biggest storehouse of bamboo in India is North East, the market of bamboo is extended all over India. Now it is up to us how we utilize it, what we produce, how much and how far can we reach, where we can capture market and how it can also become the source of livelihood for the youth, he added. Dr. Singh urged the youth of the region to utilize the home grown bamboo to produce different commodities which will help them to earn their livelihood sitting at home.  And for this purpose, with the help of the North Eastern Council (NEC) and other organizations, Ministry of DoNER would be always there to help them to facilitate their marketing beyond North East, the Minister further added. 

Talking about the importance of creating awareness about the benefits of bamboo industry, Dr. Singh said that there is no dearth of takers or buyers for our products; the only problem is that they do not know what we are producing. What is important is creating awareness, for which simultaneously the Ministry has started a campaign across the country, he said. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Secretary of North Eastern Council and Chairman, CBTC, Shri Ram Muivah said that the Cane and Bamboo Technology Park was a long awaited dream and today it got materialized. From last year Bamboo is one of the focused areas of NEC and it has lots of plans for up-gradation and strengthening of the CBTC, he added. 

Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh also visited the Cane and Bamboo Technology workshop and the product stalls within the compound of Cane and Bamboo Technology Park during the event. 

The Bamboo Technology Park has been developed to exclusively deal with Bamboo & Cane, catering to the needs of the industries, entrepreneurs, designers, crafts persons, rural people, teachers, policy makers, technicians and technologists. The Centre will  be identifying and transferring appropriate manufacturing techniques, providing technical assistance, rendering specific services such as, laboratory testing and quality assurance. This will itself promote the tangible benefits and will focus for generating village-level cluster and micro-processing units, encouraging and mobilizing SHGs, NGOs to adopt to bamboo culture, attract investment in the bamboo sector in both medium and small sector, create awareness generation, design innovation, new product development, technology infusion and adaptation to the requirement of this country. The Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre (CBTC) was established in Guwahati as a centre for “Cane and Bamboo Technological Up gradation and Networking Project” implemented by NEDFi  under the UNIDO country program for India. The Department of Science & Technology (DST), Govt. of India and United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) were the main stake holders. After completion of the Project, it was registered as a Society under North Eastern Council, Ministry of DoNER, Government of India. The CBTC has trained more than 5400 artisans, students, farmers and entrepreneurs of North Eastern Region as well as foreign countries in the field of Cane and Bamboo Technology.

                Reports have appeared in a section of the media to the effect that:


	There is a tussle between Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (M/o DoNER)  and North Eastern Council (NEC);
	M/o DoNER has restrained the council from sanctioning of new projects and instead asked NEC to clear the liabilities of NLCPR-Central Scheme of  M/o DoNER.


       In this regard, it is clarified that Union Cabinet had fixed the allocation of NEC as Rs.4500 Cr for a period of three years starting from 1st April, 2017, which included the allocation required for clearance of certain committed liabilities. 

Out of the said allocation of Rs 4500 Cr, NEC has sanctioned new projects worth Rs. 1741.06 Cr since 1st April, 2017. Therefore, the report which appeared in the media is incorrect. During the period, NEC has spent an amount of Rs 2688.33 Cr on various ongoing and newly sanctioned projects. Out of this only an amount of Rs 343.86 Cr has been utilized for clearing liabilities of schemes transferred from M/o DoNER to NEC.

NEC is a statutory body set up under an Act of Parliament, and enjoys the requisite autonomy in its functioning and freedom to sanction projects in various Sectors entrusted to NEC as per Cabinet decision subject to approval of competent authority and availability of requisite budgetary provisions. During 2017-18 and 2018-19, NEC has spent an amount of Rs 2140.29 Cr on various projects. For the current year, against an allocation of Rs 1476.10 Cr, as on Sep 09,2019 an amount of Rs 548.04 Cr has been spent on various ongoing & newly sanctioned projects. Reallocation of sectors between M/o DoNER and NEC was done with the approval of Cabinet to avoid overlapping of Sectors.

                The 68th Plenary session of the North Eastern Council (NEC) was held in Guwahati on the 8th & 9th September, 2019. 

 

The Plenary session was inaugurated by the Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah yesterday. The Union Home Minister announced that the North Eastern Council will earmark 30 per cent of its fund for focussed funding of priority areas and deprived sections of society in the North East. He said that every state will identify those villages or regions which are backward in various indicators and will work to bring those regions at par with the rest of the country. The growth story shall never be complete until the entire state progresses at par with the other part, he added. Shri Shah said that after abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, there was some misinformation that there will be also changes to Article 371. He however asserted that the Centre respects Article 371 and it will not touch the Article which grants special provisions to the North East.

 

The MoS (DoNER) Dr. Jitendra Singh while acknowledged the uniqueness of the Northeastern region, Dr Singh said that as far as the region is concerned there is much more to learn from Northeast for rest of India than Northeast has to learn from the rest of the country. In the last five years Northeast has come more into focus and that has been possible because the government is actually moving in that direction. Reiterating the commitment of the Government for the development of the Northeast, Dr Singh said that North East Council has been given its highest budgetary allotment of 1476 crore rupees for the year 2019-20.

 

All the Governors and Chief Ministers of the eight north eastern states and other members also attended the meet and presented their speeches. While addressing the Plenary, they highlighted the achievements of the NEC and gave insights for shaping the development agenda of the region. It was emphasised that NEC as a regional planning body and a resource centre should play a major role in guiding the states towards achieving the goal of development at par with the rest of the country. The creation of shared infrastructure, setting up of shared institutions and finding & pursuing common interests for all the eight states should continue to be the vision and objective of the Council.

 

Senior officials from the states and key Ministries of the Government of India were also present. From the Central Government, presentations were made by the Ministries of Civil Aviation, Telecommunications, Jal Shakti, Railways, Health & Family Welfare, Power, Road Transport and Highways, Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Tourism, External Affairs, School Education & Literacy and Food Processing highlighting recent efforts made by the Government in the NE region. Some of the key areas in which initiatives have been taken are upgradation of airports, increasing air connectivity of north east region with South-East Asian countries, strengthening broadband network and mobile connectivity especially in the uncovered villages in areas along the international border.

 

While making their presentations, the state Chief Secretaries highlighted the progress made in various projects funded by the NEC. There were deliberations on the progress of ongoing projects of the NEC, outlays by Central Ministries in the North Eastern Region and plans for the period beyond March 2020, when the Fourteenth Finance Commission era comes to an end. They also gave valuable suggestions on increasing the scope of the Council’s interventions in the Region and improving the funds flow to the states. 

The decisions and recommendations of the NEC Plenary will be sent to various Ministries and departments of the Central and state governments for taking appropriate action.

                Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah today addressed the opening session of the 68th Plenary of the North Eastern Council in Guwahati today. Shri Shah began his address by paying tribute to Bharat Ratna Late Bhupen Hazarika. He said that this day also assumes importance for the fact that today is also the Birth Anniversary of the late Bhupen Hazarika who introduced to the world the entire Northeast through his art and music. He added that Bhupen Hazarika got ample opportunities to get himself settled in other parts of the country and even outside the country as he was a legend who expressed himself through music and songs in different languages. But he never left Northeast as he was of the view that if he will leave his native place the rich heritage, culture and unique tradition of the Northeast will fail to get a platform to be showcased before the entire world, he added. He added that throughout his life he remained as the ambassador of the culture of the Northeast, and that the present Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, as a respect for his contribution for the enrichment of the rich culture of the region, conferred him with Bharat Ratna.

Shri Shah referred to the PM’s remark where he said that Northeast can be the new engine for India’s Growth and the contribution from this region towards the progress and development of the country should be the highest among other states. Northeast is a mini India in itself which consist of the mighty Himalaya range in one hand and on the other hand there is the most beautiful landscapes of the world - Barak, Brahmaputra and Imphal valley. Hinting on the immense potential of the region, Shri Shah said that Northeast comprises of around 9 percent of the total area of the country with a population of around 5 crore which comprises of 3.78 percent of the total population. The region also bears strategic importance for the fact that it shares International border for around 5300 km. referring to the diverse culture of the Northeast region, Shri Shah said that there are around 270 ethnic group and around 150 dialects in the region and all development activities and initiative should be directed towards preserving and enriching the rich heritage of this region. He said that the identity of India was never geo-political rather it was geo-cultural and if this principle is accepted by all India and Northeast will be never be treated separate. He said the cultural and linguistic identity of the North East Region should be preserved and maintained even as fast development is taking place under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi.

Quoting substantially from the Mahabharata, the Home Minister said North East and rest of  India are connected since mythological era and this will never be separated under the able leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. North East Region will develop, prosper and become a pride of India, Shri Shah asserted. He also said that the growth of Northeast during the last 5 years is much more in comparison to that of the 70 years after independence. The development process which was started in 2014 will be expected to be accomplished in 2022. Shri Shah said the 8 North Eastern states are like Astalakhmi and they will play a vital role in the development of the country.

Shri Shah announced that the North East Council will earmark 30 per cent of its fund for focussed funding of priority areas and deprived sections of society in the North East. Shri Shah said that every state will identify those villages or regions which are backward in various indicators and will work to bring those regions at par with the rest of the country. The growth story shall never be complete until the entire state progresses at par with the other part, he added.

The Minister said that the North Eastern Council have been the nodal agency since 1971 for planning and implementation towards economic and social development of the North Eastern Region and in 2022 NEC will be completing 50 years while India will be completing 75 years of its independence. He added that it is the time NEC should work on preparing the road map to ascertain the progress that Northeast will achieve by 2022. He opined that today we should set the targets to ascertain the law and order situation in Northeast by 2022 and to set the targets for enriching the culture, tradition and language of the Northeast. He said that that Northeast, as a region prior to the Independence, was the greatest contributor of GDP for the Nation and today we all should manifest our efforts and set targets to bring back those days. He also said that NEC should focus on afforestation, development of organic farming, measures to revive lost languages and measures to resolve inter-state disputes between North Eastern states.

Speaking on the Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement, Shri Shah said that the landmark decision will enable the re-establishment of link between Kolkata and Dhaka Ports. Prior to independence these ports served as the gateway for trade and commerce of the Northeast region. With the opening of the trade through this route, considering the huge natural resources of the Northeast, this region can once again become the leading contributor of GDP for the country. He said that the present government has also set up targets to bring all the eight states in the railways and air map of the country by 2022.

Shri Shah said that after abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, there was some misinformation that there will be also changes to Article 371. He however asserted that the Centre respects Article 371 and it will not touch the Article which grants special provisions to the North East.

He explained the difference between Article 370 which was temporary in nature and Article 371 which is about special provisions in the North East. “I have clarified in Parliament that this is not going to happen and I am saying it again today in Assam in presence of the eight Chief Minister”, Shah added.

Commenting on the commitment of the Central Government for the development of the Northeastern region, Shri Shah said that there has been a 1.5  time increase of budget of NEC from 13th Finance Commission to 14th Finance Commission from Rs 3376 crore to Rs 5053 crore. Enumerating the various development schemes directed towards the progress of the region Shri Shah listed some of the schemes and said that from the projected 558 projects 352 projects have been completed, construction of 997 km roads have been completed, 2480 km transmission lines have been completed, APJ Abdul Kamal Centre for Policy and Research has been set up, Bogibeel Bridge has been completed and Rs 1400 crore under the North East Road Sector Development scheme under DoNER has been sanctioned.

Speaking on the recent publication of NRC in Assam, Shri Shah expressed his satisfaction over the timely completion of the process and also added that the government will not allow a single illegal immigrant to stay back in the country.

Shri Shah said that the Northeast is progressing steadily on the road to development under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi as a result of which Northeast which was identified with  negative labels such as bandhs, blockades, extremism, arm trafficking and corruption is now known for infrastructure development, organic farming, sports, connectivity and Act East Policy.

Shri Shah concluded his address with an appeal to all the states to invest more on Bamboo Mission and added that if it is developed to its full potential it can restrict 1 lakh crore imports.

Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region and Minister of State for Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh while acknowledged the uniqueness of the Northeastern region, Dr Singh said that as far as the region is concerned there is much more to learn from Northeast for rest of India than Northeast has to learn from the rest of the country. In the last five years Northeast has come more into focus and that has been possible because the government is actually moving in that direction. He said that under the direction of the Prime Minister in every fortnight one Minister will be visiting a state of the Northeast to listen to people and ensure the region is developed in every sphere. Reiterating the commitment of the Government for the development of the Northeast, Dr Singh said that North East Council has been given its highest budgetary allotment of 1476 crore rupees for the year 2019-20.

Dr Singh said that one of the major achievements of the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during the last five years has been that the students from Northeast have been provided the facility for cost-effective living through hostels and other means in different parts of the country. He informed that a Northeast Hostel for Girl Students has been completed within the campus of Bangalore University. Similarly, he said, an exclusive Northeast Hostel is under construction within the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where a very large number of youth are pursuing higher studies. A similar will come up at Rohini for Northeast students studying in Delhi University, he added.

Complementing the youth from North Eastern region for their diligence and aspirational focus, Dr Singh said, the “Start-up India, Stand-up India” programme initiated by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been implemented in the North Eastern region, with an added incentive from the Ministry of DoNER in the form of “Venture Fund” to be provided to any young entrepreneur or Start-Up who wishes to pursue it in the region. The response to this, he said, has been very encouraging and in the years to come, Northeast may become a favourite destination for young Start-Ups from all over India.

For the youths of the Northeast, the minister added that they are at the one of the best times in the journey of India. Every youngster from across India will come forward to Northeast as his destination and that it is for people living in the Northeast to rise upto that occasion and to cultivate the capacity of being able to make the best use of these new opening of vistas of development that is happening rapidly, he added.

The NEC Plenary meeting is being attended by Governors, Chief Ministers, MPs of the Northeast and senior officers of the eight North-Eastern states and Union Ministry of DoNER.

                The Ministry of Human Resource Developments has issued a clarification regarding the news relating to the hike in the fee of M. Tech programme in IITs. The HRD Ministry has clarified that the decision of the Council of IITs to accept the recommendations of a three Member Committee on reforms in the M.Tech. programmes in IITs is based on the following facts:-

 


	There is no fee hike for the existing students.
	For new admissions, hike will be gradual over a period of three years or more, as will be decided by the respective Board of Governors of IITs.
	Needy students will be provided necessary financial support. 
	All concessions and scholarships for SC/ST/OBC and others will continue without change.
	The fee hike will discourage non-serious students, who after a few months of stay in IITs, leave the programme midway to take up employment or to prepare for competitive exams.
	This drop out in the middle of the programme leads to wastage of coveted seats on the one hand and denies opportunity to other serious and meritorious students, on the other.
	IITs will offer only those programmes that have demand in the market.  This will ensure immediate placement after completion of the course.
	Good and deserving students will be provided Teaching Assistantship/Scholarship.
	The fee for the M.Tech. programmes in IITs have not been revised for a long time whereas the cost per student has gone up substantially.


The Ministry has assured to all future students who will come to study at IITs that no student will be deprived of opportunity for education because of weak financial condition.

                To channelize the energy of the youth from Jammu and Kashmir, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has implemented the Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme for Jammu and Kashmir Students. 

Taking one step forward, today, on 27th September, 2019, AICTE and IIT Guwahati have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in the auspicious presence of Union Minster for Human Resource Development, Shri. Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ for extending internships to students from Jammu and Kashmir and students studying in AICTE approved institutions across the country under Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme.

Under this MoU, IIT Guwahati will enrol 100 Meritorious students from Jammu and Kashmir in batches of 25, for internship at IIT Guwahati from 1st May 2020 - 30th May 2020. The objective of the MoU is to provide an exposure to the youth from Jammu and Kashmir to the academic culture at Higher Learning Institutes of India. 

The MoU was signed during the IIT Council meeting at IIT Delhi on 27th September 2019. Union Minster for Human Resource Development, Shri. Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ encouraged other IIT’s to be involved in this Nation building initiative. Three other IITs at Kanpur, Raipur and Hyderabad have also expressed their interest in such an MoU. Prof. Anil D. Sahasrabudhe, Chairman, AICTE, informed that AICTE has decided to contact all other IITs/NITs & IIMs to follow suit so that maximum number of brothers and sisters from J&K get empowered.

                Union HRD Minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'  chaired the 53rdMeeting of the Council of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) at IIT Delhitoday. Minister of State for HRD Shri Sanjay ShamraoDhotre was also present on the occasion.

The following major decisions have been taken: -

 


	Every IIT will work on improving their research excellence and through that their national and international rankings. For this, each IIT will come up with their action plan. 
	For promoting IITs as global education destinations, foreign students - including the OCI card holders with foreign passport & have studied abroad - would be provided direct entry to appear in the JEE Advanced examinations. Further, IITs would prepare a scheme for providing scholarships for the bright foreign students to study in IITs. They would also explore the possibility of offering online programmes to students both in India and abroad. The process of recruiting foreign faculty would be continued by liberalising the current regulatory processes. 
	A major drive will be launched for improving the hostel facilities and rebuilding the dilapidated hostels. Separate funding for this would be earmarked under HEFA. Further, where possible, the PPP model would be implemented which would be started by IIT Delhi. 
	In order to promote excellence in the IITs, all new appointments would be through tenure tracksystem, under which IITs will have more flexibility in recruitment without insisting for necessary three years post-PhD experience. The performance of such faculty members will be reviewed by an Internal Review Committee after three years,and by an External Review Committee after fifth year based on which the decision for their retention or promotion to the next higher grade will be decided. It was also decided that the first and second generation IITs will not engage faculty membersfrom third generation IITs before they complete a minimum of two years.
	The Council approved, in principle, recommendations of the three Member Committeeconstituted for suggesting reforms in M.Tech system. The Committee has, inter-alia, recommended uniform fee structure for M.Techprogramme in all IITs, and for charging the same fee for M Tech as in B Tech programmes.  Institutions are encouraged to move towards sponsored students or even sponsored programmes as per requirement of industry.
	Academically weak students, who are not able to secure the required credits for promotion to the next semester may be allowed an exit optionwith a degree programmeafter second semester,rather than being forced out of the programme. Individual IITswill decide modalities for this.
	In order to ensure that students passing out from IITs do not face any difficulty in foreign countries with regard to their degrees not being accredited by the designated authority, the Council decided that external peer review of IITs will be done by an External Review Committee in the format prescribed by the NBA and based on the review by the Committee, accreditation will be given by NBA.
	Continuation of the weaker section scholarships for slow paced students for one additional year beyond the regular term of four years.
	Each IIT will identify their thrust areas for specialization and communicate the same to MHRD within a month.In these areas, they have to set up nation-best research facilities. 
	The  HRD Minister launched a common IIT/IISc admission portal developed by IIT Bombay for international applicants interested in pursuing postgraduate studies.

                Union Human Resource Minister, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ’Nishank’ chaired the Special Meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) held in New Delhi today. The meeting was attended by Shri Prahlad Singh Patel, MoS (Independent Charge) for Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Tourism, Shri Kiren Rijiju, MoS (Independent Charge) for Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and MoS, Ministry of Minority Affairs, and Shri Sanjay Dhotre, Minister of State for Human Resource Development. 

26 Education Ministers of various States and UTs, representatives of States and Union Territories, Members of CABE, Heads of Autonomous Organisations, Vice Chancellors of Universities, and   Shri R. Subrahmanyam, Secretary, Department of Higher Education and Member Secretary, CABE and Smt. Rina Ray, Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy were present in the meeting along with senior officials of the Central and State Governments.

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister Shri Pokhriyal informed the House that the Government has initiated a major exercise to formulate a National Education Policy that will aim to fulfil the aspiration of the youth for quality education and make our country a knowledge superpower. The extant National Policy on Education, 1986 modified in 1992 required changes to meet the contemporary and futuristic needs of our large youth population. Thus, this policy is being brought out after more than three decades. He further highlighted that a massive consultative process over four years has been undertaken and the Draft National Education Policy, 2019 has been submitted by the Committee formed to Draft National Education Policy headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, to the Ministry on 31st May 2019.  

He said that this Special Meeting of CABE has been convened to discuss the Draft NEP so that in the spirit of cooperative federalism both the Central and State Governments interact and engage in a healthy and enriching dialogue to bring out a robust policy that will empower our youth to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

While addressing the gathering Shri Dhotre highlighted that  several new initiatives are being taken both in school and higher education to increase access, ensure inclusion, and promote quality and excellence.  He appreciated that the State Governments have also been making pioneering efforts to make education accessible, equitable and qualitative. He said that the educational reforms are an ongoing process and the Government is committed to bring out relevant changes suited to dynamic socio-economic needs.  With time, new concerns do emerge, for example, eradication of single-use plastic, swachhata, and increasing the green coverage, as envisioned by the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji. These ideas have caught the fancies of the people, especially the younger ones. These concerns also need to be included in our educational planning and practices.

Shri Kiren Rijiju in his address gave an overview of the Fit India Movement. He echoed the views of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that ‘Fit India Movement’ should become a national goal.  He said that the technology has reduced our daily fitness routines and the lack of a physical fitness regime has resulted in lifestyle diseases. He exhorted the states to popularize the Fit India movement in their educational institutions and sensitize people to move towards a fitness regime. He added that our country has a large and growing youth population and if our youth are not healthy and fit, they cannot contribute to the economic growth and national development.

Shri Prahlad Singh Patel said that culture and education are related and interdependent. He added that children and youth should be motivated to learn more and more from interaction among various cultures, and education should impart knowledge and culture to the new generation and transform the outlook of the students.

During the inaugural session of CABE meeting, the Union Minister for HRD released the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) 2018-19.  Some of main findings of the survey are: GER in higher education has increased from 25.8 in 2017-18 to 26.3 in 2018-19, while in absolute terms the enrolment increased from 3.66 crore to 3.74 crore students. GER for SCs has also shown a growth from 21.8 to 23.0 and STs from 15.9 to 17.2. In terms of increase in the number of universities, they have grown from 903 (2017-18) to 993 (2018-19) and total HEIs from 49,964 to 51,649 in the same corresponding period. The number of faculty increased from 13.88 lakhs to 14.16 lakhs.

The Minister also launched the Plagiarism Detention Software (PDS) ""Shodh Shuddhi”. This service is being implemented by INFLIBNET, an Inter University Centre (IUC) of UGC. PDS will significantly help to improve the quality of research outcome by ensuring the originality of ideas and publication of the research scholars. Initially, about 1000 Universities/ Institutions (Central Universities; Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs); State Public Universities; Deemed Universities; Private Universities; Inter University Centre (IUCs) & Institutes of National Importance are being provided with this service. 

The main agenda of the Special meeting of CABE was to discuss the Draft National Education Policy 2019 (DNEP 2019). There were two separate presentations on the main highlights of the DNEP 2019 covering the School and Higher Education. The House had detailed deliberations on several recommendations and reforms proposed in the Draft NEP. There were valuable suggestions given by the Education Ministers of States, who are equal partners in policy formulation and felt that their inputs are critical so that the proposed National education Policy can be a catalyst to achieve the goals of equitable access to quality education while ensuring affordability of education and instilling greater accountability of 

The Union Minister for Human Resource Development in his concluding remarks expressed deep appreciation for the active participation by the CABE members. He said that it was a truly democratic discussion with very valuable inputs, views and suggestions and he respects the sentiments voiced. He assured the house all these inputs and suggestions will be given due importance when the Ministry will finalise the Policy.

Ministry of Human Resource Development has announced a new PPP Scheme, National Educational Alliance for Technology (NEAT) for using technology for better learning outcomes in Higher Education.

The objective is to use Artificial Intelligence to make learning more personalised and customised as per the requirements of the learner. This requires development of technologies in Adaptive Learning to address the diversity of learners. There are a number of start-up companies developing this and MHRD would like to recognise such efforts and bring them under a common platform so that learners can access it easily. Educating the youth is a National effort and MHRD proposes to create a National Alliance with such technology developing EdTech Companies through a PPP model.

 

MHRD would act as a facilitator to ensure that the solutions are freely available to a large number of economically backward students. MHRD would create and maintain a National NEAT platform that would provide one-stop access to these technological solutions. EdTech companies would be responsible for developing solutions and manage registration of learners through the NEAT portal. They would be free to charge fees as per their policy. As their contribution towards the National cause, they would have to offer free coupons to the extent of 25% of the total registrations for their solution through NEAT portal. MHRD would distribute the free coupons for learning to the most socially/economically backward students.


AICTE would be the implementing agency for NEAT programme. The scheme shall be administered under the guidance of an Apex Committee constituted by MHRD. Independent Expert Committees would be constituted for evaluating and selecting the EdTech solutions. MoUs will be signed with the shortlisted EdTech companies. Awareness programs would be taken up by MHRD to create awareness of the NEAT solutions to teachers and students.

 MHRD proposes to launch and operationalise NEAT  in early November 2019.

Model Curriculum for Diploma Courses

AICTE, fully aware of the fact that diploma education should make students job ready faster, in consultation with its All India Board of Technician Education (AIBTE) constituted subject-wise team of 3-4 experts drawn from academia and industry to prepare model curriculum for Diploma Courses in seven disciplines. This Model Curriculum has come up after several meetings and thoughtful deliberations of experts. It has been prepared while keeping in view the latest industry trends and market requirements. Salient features of Model Curriculum for Diploma Courses in Engineering & Technology are as follows:


	Reduced number of credits.
	Two-week mandatory Induction Program for students has been designed and has to be given at the beginning of the course.
	Introduction of credit course on Sports & Yoga in first semester to inculcate the habit of physical and mental fitness right at the start.
	Well defined learning objectives & outcomes for each course.
	Inclusion of courses on socially relevant topics. Course on Indian Constitution, Environmental Science & Essence of Indian Knowledge and Tradition have been embedded in the curriculum as audit course.
	Built-in flexibility to the students in terms of program elective and open elective courses. 
	Two mandatory internships to equip the students with practical knowledge and provide them exposure to real time industrial environments. Further, in one of the internships, option is provided to do internship in social sector/Govt. initiated social schemes/NGOs etc.  AICTE has made 7-10 weeks summer internships mandatory in the new curriculum which will equip the students with practical understanding and training about industry practices in a suitable industry or organization.
	Course on Entrepreneurship and Startups to encourage entrepreneurial skills.
	To the extent possible, the weightage of theory and practical (in terms of contact hours) has been balanced.
	A list of experiments, with the objective clearly spelt out, is specified for each lab course.
	Provision of organizing at least one expert lecture per semester for each branch by inviting resource persons from domain specific industry.


 

360-degree Feedback of Faculty

Teachers play the key role of developing the most important national resource (human resource), the young talent of students that will define the future of our country. As per the recommendations of AICTE, Ministry of Human Resources Development gave the mandate to the 7th Pay Commission, of understanding certain key aspects of teacher’s activities and its impact as perceived by other key stake holders of the college education process.

AICTE 7thPay Regulation defines the process of collecting the 360-degree Feedback Data that will be submitted by the education institutes. It starts by first establishing a data framework that maps Teachers, Students and Subjects/courses to capture the data at source through online mechanism.

The process begins by self reporting of the Teaching Process and other Contributions to the Society by the teachers themselves. This will attract a value of 25 and 10 marks respectively.  The head of the department where the teacher works would also report the Departmental Activities performed by the teacher that would attract 20 marks. The Principal of the institute would further add Institute Activities for 10 marks and the Annual Confidential Report (ACR) for 10 marks for every teacher. A very important part of the feedback is added by the students giving objective as well as personal experience by answering 14 questions to be graded on a scale of 1 to 5. This feedback will attract 25 points making complete 100 % feedback. (Total = 25 + 10 +20 +10 +10 +25 = 100%). In order to facilitate this process AICTE in association with Smart Cookie Rewards Pvt. Ltd (having MoU with AICTE) has developed an online Framework to collect the feedback data. 

The system will further summarize & share the collected data for the Department/Institute/College management for giving increments and promotions for the teachers. Also, AICTE will provide regulatory compliance to ensure transparency and fairness of the process. 

‘Wawe Summit 2019’ 

(Waste Management Accelerators for Aspire Women Entrepreneurs)

It will be the largest gathering of young women students to promote entrepreneurship in waste management and providing alternatives to single use plastic carry bags. Indian Institute of Waste Management (IIWM)&All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) will be registering the interested participation and guiding them to connect from “Start Up India to Stand Up India”


	Theme: Make your own bag – empowering women to take up income generation activity and entrepreneurship in waste management through making a business out of this record creating concept. 
	This conclave will be part of a series of activities to encourage entrepreneurship amongst young graduates. 


Secretary, Department of Higher Education Shri R. Subrahmanyam, Chairman, AICTE Dr. Anil Sahasrabudhe and other senior officials of Ministry and AICTE were also presented on this occasion.

Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching (ARPIT) –

Ministry of Human Resource Development launched Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching (ARPIT) in November, 2018. ARPIT is a major and unique initiative of online professional development of 1.5 million higher education faculty using the MOOCs platform SWAYAM. For implementing ARPIT, discipline-specific National Resource Centers (NRCs) are identified which are tasked  to prepare online training material with focus on latest developments in the discipline, new & emerging trends, pedagogical improvements and methodologies for transacting revised curriculum. 

For ARPIT 2019, 51 discipline specific NRCs have been notified covering 46 disciplines, such as, Agriculture, Law, Architecture,  Social Sciences, Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Geography, Home Science, Tribal studies, Commerce, Library and Information sciences, Curriculum development, Humanities, Language Teaching in Sanskrit, Urdu, Hindi and English, Pharmacy, Skill development, Textile Technology, Management, Public Policy, Leadership & Governance, Library & Information Science, Astronomy & Astrophysics, Assessment and Evaluation, Pedagogy and research methods, Climate Change etc. The training materials have now been uploaded and made available through SWAYAM to all the teachers from 1st September, 2019. Currently, registrations are open for the online refresher courses on SWAYAM platform, India’s own indigenous MOOC’s education engine and can be accessed https://swayam.gov.in/explorer?category=ARPIT

As on date, the enrolment for ARPIT 2019 is around 48,000. As part of popularizing ARPIT, NIC has sent bulk mails/SMS to all faculties in the relevant disciplines, which covers around 10 lakh faculty in HEIs.   

In the inaugural year 2018, 75 NRCs were notified to cover a range of courses in different disciplines of Social Sciences, Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Design & Manufacturing, Humanities, Language Teaching, Commerce, Management, Education Planning and Administration, Public Policy, Leadership & Governance, Library & Information Science, Astronomy & Astrophysics, Assessment and Evaluation, Pedagogy and research methods, cutting edge areas of Nano-sciences, Internet of Things, etc. 

Through ARPIT all in-service teachers, irrespective of their subject and seniority have been given an enabling opportunity to keep abreast of the latest developments in their disciplines through the technology based online refresher courses. Faculty can benefit from this initiative as it is highly flexible and can be done at one’s own pace and time. The NRCs will revolutionize professional development of faculty by catering to massive numbers by leveraging ICT and online technology platform of SWAYAM.

The NRCs initially develop a 3 minute video(s) which is assessed technically by AICTE and after having met the MOOC guidelines; the same have been approved and uploaded on SWAYAM Portal.  The course is a 40 hour module with 20 hours of video content and 20 hours of non-video content.

UGC constituted Expert Committee prepared a Curriculum for Life Skills (JeevanKaushal) for Under Graduate Programme. The curriculum is designed to impart and strengthen the knowledge,skills and dispositions believed to be the best requisites of the current Industry and thereby empower the talent inherent in each learner. Life Skills like communication skill, interpersonal skill, time management, problem solving ability, decision making capacity, leadership ability and integrity play a crucial role in boosting the employability of the students.

This space journey is a stepping stone for further development. He further appreciated the sensitive gesture of the Hon’ble Prime Minister towards the scientific community of ISRO.   The minister elaborated the plans of the Union government to take the higher education in the nation to the next level.

 Speaking on the occasion, the Additional Director General, Shri Narendra Kumar Kaushal highlighted the importance of communication in a democratic society and added that such interaction of the Union Ministers with the fourth estate should take place more regularly.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind presented the National Award to 46 Teacherson the occasion of Teachers’ Day, in New Delhi today. The Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, and the Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Shri Sanjay Dhotre also grace the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that strong foundations of character-building are laid in schools. The main objective of education is to make the student a good human-being. And teachers do so by instilling honesty, discipline and integrity in their students. A good human-being possessing these values ​​will prove to be good in each and every sphere. By ensuring that their students become good human beings, teachers contribute in the nation-building process.

The President said that today, the world is moving from information era to knowledge era. However, knowledge alone will not be able to ensure the safety of human civilization. Along with knowledge, it is also necessary to have a conscience. Only when knowledge is combined with wisdom, it can solve human problems. In this globalized and highly competitive world, we have to establish a balance between ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘human compassion’ and between ‘digital learning’ and ‘character building’. Only on the basis of such rational knowledge, we can tackle the present challenges such as climate change, pollution, melting glaciers etc. Teachers can contribute significantly in the national campaign of water conservation by instilling in students the importance of water conservation.

The President urged teachers to build a new generation that is full of knowledge and wisdom, so that it can successfully address all the contemporary challenges.

The purpose of National Awards to Teachers is to celebrate the unique contribution of some of the finest teachers in the country and to honor those teachers who through their commitment and industry have not only improved the quality of school education but also enriched the lives of their students.

This year the online self nomination process followed by 3 tier selection process at District, State and National level has been completed. The Independent National Jury recommended name of 46 teachers. The criterion adopted was to select those teachers who had shown innovation in their work and had added value to the school and to their students. These nominated teachers gave a presentation before an independent Jury comprising a senior educationist. This ensured that all of them were given an opportunity to place before the jury their contribution and the work done by them. The basic premise now is that the new scheme should be transparent, fair, and reward demonstrated excellence and performance and has been inspired by recent innovations in major national awards. The award carries a Silver Medal, Certificate and Rs. 50,000/- as award money.

The features of the new scheme are as under:


	Online self-nominations from teachers were invited on mhrd.gov.in. The Webportal was developed by the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) and the entire software ran smoothly. 
	Applications were received online from teachers from all over the country.
	All regular teachers were eligible and no minimum years of service was required. This enabled meritorious young teachers to apply. 
	The number of awards was rationalized to maximum of 47, thereby restoring the prestige of the awards. 
	No State, UT or Organization had a quota in the final selection. This encouraged them to compete for the awards.


An independent Jury at the National level made the final selection. The Jury reviewed the list of candidates forwarded by all States, UTs and Organisations. Each nominee made a presentation before the Jury, which made a final assessment and recommended 46 names for the Teachers Awards this year.

Smt.Rina Ray, Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy and Shri R. Subrahmanyam, Secretary, Department of Higher Education and other senior officialswere present on the occasion.

On 4th September 2019, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, on the advice of UGC and the Empowered Expert Committee issued orders to 5 public Universities conveying their declaration as Institutions of Eminence (IoE). These are IIT Madras, Banaras Hindu University, IIT Kharagpur, University of Delhi and University of Hyderabad. In addition, Letters of Intent were issued to 5 Private Universities for accepting and sending their preparedness for being declared as Institutions of Eminence. These are Amrita Viswavidyapeetham, Tamil Nadu, Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Odisha & Bharti Institute, Satya Bharti Foundation, Mohali. These institutions will need to submit their readiness for commencing academic operations as IoEs.

Further, in respect of 2 more Universities, Shiv Nadar University, UP and O.P Jindal University, Haryana letters were issued to the State Government to pass legislation in the State Assembly to cease the status of these Universities as Private Universities under the State and so as to enable them to be considered as IoE Deemed Universities.  

In regard to2 State Universities, Jadavpur University, West Bengal and Anna University, Tamil Nadu were also selected by the Empowered Committee and the State Governments have been asked to indicate their commitment towards their contribution under the IoE scheme. 

Earlier, in the first round under the IoE scheme, 6 institutions were selected as IoEs:


	
		
			
			Public Category
			
			
			Private Category
			
		
		
			
			Indian Institute of Sciencee (IISc), Bangalore

			Birla Institute of Technology& Sciences (BITS), Pilani
			
		
		
			
			Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay
			
			
			Jio Institute under the Greenfield category.
			
		
	


 

The 3 Public Institutions were declared IoEs, while the 3 private institutions were issued Letters of Intent.  Till date we have 16 institutions as IoEs, apart from which  another 4 institutions where State Government’s confirmation and commitment is awaited.

                The President of India , Shri Ram NathKovind will confer National Award to Teachers-2018 in New Delhi tomorrow. The national level awards are given to teachers on Teachers' Day to celebrate the unique contribution of some of the finest teachers in the country and to honor those teachers who through their commitment have not only improved the quality of school education but also enriched the lives of their students.

Union Human Resource Development Minister, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal‘Nishank’ interacted with the recipients of the National Teachers’ Awards on the eve of Teachers' Day, in New Delhi today. 

Speaking on the occasion Union Minister on the behalf of HRD Ministry congratulated all the National awardee Teachers. He hoped that all teachers will try to fulfill the requirements of nation building. The Minister quoted the Former President of India Dr.SarvepalliRadhakrishnan, who once said that, teachers are the cornerstone of  education. He added that an influential teacher adds more value to education and plays an important role in holistic development of students. He added that a true teacher always guides us and helps us in dealing with tough situations of life and teachers introduce students to a vast treasure of knowledge. 

The Minister further added that ‘Guru’ word is a combination of two words ‘Gu’ means darkness and ‘Ru’ means to overcome. He explained that there is a tradition in our country to see teachers as a symbol of good behavior. They must exhibit best qualities to remain as an ideal in the eyes of students. 

While addressing the gathering , Shri Dhotre exhorted the teachers to focus on each and every child equally and channelise and hone their raw energies into creativity. He said that it is teachers' responsibility to remove all hesitations, apprehensions and confusion from minds of young students and guide them towards intellectual and emotional maturity. Highlighting the crucial importance of school education, Shri Dhotre said that only wellnurtured and healthy plants grow into robust fruit-bearing trees. He also requested the distinguished teachers to focus on inculcation of right values their students, and also share their experiences with the larger teacher community.

For the year 2018, the online self nomination process followed by 3 tier selection process at District, State and National level was followed. The Independent National Jury recommended name of 46 teachers. The criterion adopted was to select those teachers who had shown innovation in their work and had added value to the school and to their students. These nominated teachers gave a presentation before an independent Jury comprising a senior educationist. This ensured that all of them were given an opportunity to place before the jury their contribution and the work done by them. The basic premise now is that the new scheme should be transparent, fair, and reward demonstrated excellence and performance and has been inspired by recent innovations in major national awards. The award carries a Silver Medal, Certificate and Rs. 50,000/- as award money.

The features of the new scheme are as under:


	Online self-nominations from teachers were invited on mhrd.gov.in. The Webportal was developed by the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) and the entire software ran smoothly. 
	Applications were received online from teachers from all over the country.
	All regular teachers were eligible and no minimum years of service was required. This enabled meritorious young teachers to apply. 
	The number of awards was rationalized to maximum of 47, thereby restoring the prestige of the awards. 
	No State, UT or Organization had a quota in the final selection. This encouraged them to compete for the awards.
	An independent Jury at the National level made the final selection. The Jury reviewed the list of candidates forwarded by all States, UTs and Organisations. Each nominee made a presentation before the Jury, which made a final assessment and recommended 46 names for the Teachers Awards this year.


During the event the awardees highlighted the exceptional contributions made by them in the field of education. Smt Rina Ray, Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy and senior officials of the Ministry were also present on the occasion.

                Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Communications and Law & Justice, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad will hold round table discussions with prominent leaders of Electronics Industry at Vigyan Bhawan on 16.09.2019. The round table discussion will essentially be to brainstorm about the challenges being faced by the Industry, opportunities and expectations of the industry from the Government so that the Indian electronics manufacturing sector can grow at a fast pace.

The Government of India attaches high priority to domestic electronics hardware manufacturing and it is one of the important pillars of both “Make in India” and “Digital India” programmes of the Government. As a result of implementation of several schemes and initiatives for promotion of electronics hardware manufacturing and efforts of the industry, considerable progress has been made in last 5 years, especially in import substitution. Some of the key highlights of the Electronics sector in India include:


	Over USD 15 billion worth of investment proposals received directly by the Ministry of Electronics and IT under its flagship investment scheme 
	Domestic manufacturing has grown from USD 29 billion (in 2014-15) to USD 70 billion (in 2018-19) 
	India has emerged as the 2nd largest manufacturer of mobile handsets in the world and one of the world’s largest mobile manufacturing facility is based in India
	No. of manufacturing units for LCD/ LED TVs has gone up from 25 to 35 units
	No. of LED lights manufacturing units has gone up from 10 to 128 units
	Generated employment for over 20 lakh persons across the country
	Lately exports of electronics goods have started growing rapidly 


There is a significant scope for the growth in this sector with the burgeoning domestic market, which is estimated to reach USD 400 billion by 2025 and the on-going global trade dynamics, especially in the technology space. With its strengths in market, technology talent pool, rapidly growing competitive economy and positioning in global dynamics, India truly holds the potential to become the “Electronics Factory” of the world.

National Policy on Electronics 2019 envisions positioning India as a global electronics hub by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components (including chipsets), and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally. MeitY is planning to embark upon a comprehensive investment and trade promotion programme to make Electronics India a brand synonymous with next Electronics Hub.

Around 50 Industry leaders have confirmed their participation in the round table to deliberate upon the mutual expectations from the Government and the Industry, to achieve the true potential of domestic electronics manufacturing and the measures required to achieve it. Representation has been confirmed from all the major verticals of the electronics sector such as mobile handsets, consumer electronics, strategic electronics, medical devices, Information Technology, electronic manufacturing services, electronic components, telecom and LED lighting, among others.

Key industry leaders joining the round table discussions will be from Apple, Samsung, Vivo, Oppo, Lava, Qualcomm, Xiaomi, Dell, HP, Philips, Bosch, Cisco, Flextronics, Foxconn, Nokia,  LG, Panasonic, TDK, Intel, AMD, Wistron, Delta, Salcomp, Sterlite Technologies and Nidec, among others. 

While the Union Minister will spell out his vision for the sector in the coming years and will encourage the CEOs to place on the table their commitment to that vision, he will also have an open minded engagement with the CEOs about their expectations from the Government to help them meet their commitments.

India is hosting the Second Lead Author Meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group III Sixth Assessment Report at New Delhi, beginning 30th September to 4th October 2019. 

 

Speaking at a press briefing today, Secretary, Ministry of Environment Forest &Climate Change (MoEFCC), Shri C.K. Mishra dwelt upon the challenges and viable solutions to climate change. He also pointed out that IPCC authors and scientists are working to deliver the most relevant and up-to-date research on climate change mitigation. “Global coalition on innovation and technology is the way forward”, said Shri C.K Mishra. 

 



 

More than 200 experts/authors including 12 from India and others from around 65 countries are expected to participate in this week-long meeting at New Delhi. 

 

Mr. Jim Skea, Co-Chair of Working Group III highlighted the role of the Sixth Assessment Report. He said “Building on previous Working Group III assessments, this report will emphasize what can be done in the near term to mitigate climate change, and how mitigation actions can be enabled through policy, institution-building and finance”.



 

The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) will examine topics such as the link between consumption and behaviour and greenhouse gas emissions, and the role of innovation and technology. The report will assess the connection between short to medium-term actions and their compatibility with the long-term temperature goal in the Paris Agreement. It will assess mitigation options in sectors such as energy, agriculture, forestry and land use, buildings, transport and industry.

 

The First Order Draft will be available for Expert Review from 13 January to 8 March 2020. The Second Order Draft will be open for Government and Expert Review from 13 July to 13 September 2020, along with the first draft of the Summary for Policymakers. The IPCC Panel is due to consider the Working Group III contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report at a plenary session on 12 to 16 July 2021.

 

Each of the three IPCC Working Groups will release their contributions to the Sixth Assessment Report in 2021. A Synthesis Report in 2022 will integrate them together with the three special reports that the IPCC is producing in the current assessment cycle. It will be released in time to inform the 2023 global stock take by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) when countries will review progress towards the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming to well below 2°C while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.

 

 

About IPCC:

 

The IPCC is the UN body for assessing the science related to climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide political leaders with periodic scientific assessments concerning climate change, its implications and risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation strategies. It has 195 member states.

 

Thousands of people from all over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC. For the assessment reports, IPCC scientists volunteer their time to assess the thousands of scientific papers published each year to provide a comprehensive summary of what is known about the drivers of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and how adaptation and mitigation can reduce those risks.

 

The IPCC has three working groups: Working Group I, dealing with the physical science basis of climate change; Working Group II, dealing with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and Working Group III, dealing with the mitigation of climate change. It also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories that develops methodologies for measuring emissions and removals.

                A new initiative was launched on 23rd September at the UN Climate Action Summit to help guide the world’s heaviest greenhouse gas emitting industries toward the low-carbon economy.

India and Sweden together with Argentina, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, South Korea and the UK, as well as a group of companies including Dalmia Cement, DSM, Heathrow Airport, LKAB, Mahindra Group, Royal Schiphol Group, Scania, SpiceJet, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp and Vattenfall, announced a new Leadership Group for Industry Transition that will drive transformation in hard-to-decarbonize and energy-intensive sectors. 

This global initiative will be supported by the World Economic Forum, the Energy Transitions Commission, Mission Innovation, Stockholm Environment Institute, and the European Climate Foundation among many others in an ambitious, public-private effort, to ensure heavy industries and mobility companies can find a workable pathway to deliver on the Paris Agreement

In his statement Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said that “each one of us has to discharge climate responsibilities based on our situations and capacities. I hope that work under the industry transition track will facilitate early diffusion of technology and support to developing countries in this journey”.

Addressing a press conference, Union Environment Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar said that the last two days have seen major takeaways including the decision that heavy industries who are doing their bit on their own, without any external help, have decided to have a low carbon path.

In welcoming this new public-private partnership, Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum said: “There is a huge level of support and enthusiasm in the private sector to engage with governments and peers to reduce emissions across their operations and value chains.

Industry sector emissions, including those from hard-to-abate and energy-intensive sectors like steel, cement, aluminum, aviation and shipping are expected to be responsible for 15.7Gt by 2050. The international collaboration between countries and industry groups is critical to establish workable policy frameworks and incentives, and to enable joint investment into low carbon infrastructure. 


About The Climate Action Summit

The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres hosted the Climate Action Summit in New York ahead of the UN General Assembly. The Secretary-General called on all leaders – governments, the private sector, civil society, local authorities and other international organizations – to come with concrete, realistic plans that will boost ambition and rapidly accelerate action to implement the Paris Agreement.

Having the key focus on raising ambition and accelerate action to implement the Paris Agreement, the Climate Action Summit focuses on nine interdependent tracks, which are led by 19 countries in total and are supported by international organizations.

It is noteworthy to point that India along with Sweden, supported by World Economic Forum is leading the ‘Industry Transition’ track meeting.

                World leaders have gathered in New York today for the United Nations Secretary General (UNSG) Climate Action Summit. The Summit is being called by UNSG Mr. António Guterres to ramp up climate actions worldwide. Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi stated “We must accept that if we have to overcome a serious challenge like climate change, then what we are doing at the moment is just not enough;
What is needed today, is a comprehensive approach which covers everything from education to values, and from lifestyle to developmental philosophy”. 

 

Bringing attention towards India’s efforts in always following a climate sensitive sustainable development pathway by mainstreaming climate change concerns in development policies, Shri Narendra Modi stated “Need, not greed has been our guiding principle. PM expressed that an ounce of practice is worth more than a ton of preaching. “In India, we are going to increase the share of non-fossil fuels to 175GW by 2022, and to further increase it to 450GW”, announced Shri Narendra Modi.

 

 

 

“We have launched the Jal Jeevan mission for water conservation, rainwater harvesting and for the development of water resources. India is going to spend approximately 50 billion dollars on this in the next few years”,the Prime Minister further informed the gathering.

 

Prime Minister further said that on the occasion of India’s 73rdIndependence Day, we have called for a people’s movement to end the menace of single use plastic. PM expressed hope that this will create an awareness at a global level about the harmful effects of single use plastic.

 

“On the International forum, almost 80 countries have joined our International Solar Alliance campaign. In order to make our infrastructure disaster resilient, India is launching a Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.”, the PM invited UN Member states to join this coalition.

 

Earlierin his thought-provoking opening remarks the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres shed light on the significance of science and technology and its use as a powerful tool in combating climate change. “The climate crisis is caused by us and the solutions must come from us. We have the tools, technology is on our side, readily available technological substitutions already exists for more than 70% of today’s emissions”, said Mr. Guterres .

 

Having the key focus on raising ambition and accelerate action to implement the Paris Agreement, the Climate Action Summit focuses on nine interdependent tracks, which are led by 19 countries in total and are supported by international organizations. The Summit has brought together governments, private sector, civil society, local authorities and other international organizations to develop ambitious solutions in actionable areas. The Secretary-General has also prioritized a number of action portfolios. The key areas identified are the following: 

· Finance: mobilizing public and private sources of finance to drive decarbonization of all priority sectors and advance resilience;

· Energy Transition: accelerating the shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy, as well as making significant gains in energy efficiency;

· Industry Transition: transforming industries such as oil and gas, steel, cement, chemicals and information technology; 

· Nature-Based Solutions: reducing emissions, increasing sink capacity and enhancing resilience within and across forestry, agriculture, oceans and food systems, including through biodiversity conservation, leveraging supply chains and technology; 

· Cities and Local Action: advancing mitigation and resilience at urban and local levels, with a focus on new commitments on low-emission buildings, mass transport and urban infrastructure; and resilience for the urban poor; 

· Resilience and Adaptation: advancing global efforts to address and manage the impacts and risks of climate change, particularly in those communities and nations most vulnerable. 

· Mitigation Strategy: to generate momentum for ambitious NDCs and longterm strategies to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. 

· Youth Engagement and Public Mobilization: to mobilize people worldwide to take action on climate change and ensure that young people are integrated and represented across all aspects of the Summit, including the six transformational areas. 

· Social and Political Drivers: to advance commitments in areas that affect people’s well-being, such as reducing air pollution, generating decent jobs, and strengthening climate adaptation strategies and protect workers and vulnerable groups.

 

It is noteworthy to point that India along with Sweden, supported by World Economic Forum is leading the ‘Industry Transition’ track meeting.India and Sweden together with other partners are launching the Leadership group within the Industry transition track. This initiative will provide a platform for governments and the private sector with opportunities for cooperation in the area of Technology innovation.

                At an event to mark the World Ozone Day 2019 in New Delhi, Union Minister of State (MoS) for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Babul Supriyo said  that the World Ozone Day offers an opportunity to focus global attention and action on the vital environmental issue of protection of the stratospheric ozone Layer. 



Shri Babul Supriyo highlighted the fact that India became one of the first countries in the world to launch a comprehensive Cooling Action plan in March, 2019, which has a long term vision to address the cooling requirement across sectors such as residential and commercial buildings, cold-chain, refrigeration, transport and industries. The India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP) lists out actions which can help reduce the cooling demand, which will also help in reducing both direct and indirect emissions. 

The Minister also underlined that the importance of development of National Cooling Action Plans has been recognized by the United Nations Secretary General, Mr António Guterres in his message on World Ozone day 2019 where the need for all countries to develop national cooling action plans has been highlighted. “It is heartening to note that a step taken by India has led to a global recognition of this important policy initiative which can help in climate action and achievement of sustainable development goals.”, said the MoS    

He pointed out that the ICAP has been appreciated internationally as an important policy initiative which has the potential to provide socio-economic and environmental benefits related to reduced refrigerant use, climate change mitigation and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many countries are now involved in development of cooling action plans keeping in view the significant environmental benefits and the fulfillment of Sustainable Development Goals.

The India Cooling Action seeks to (i) reduce cooling demand across sectors by 20% to 25% by 2037-38, (ii) reduce refrigerant demand by 25% to 30% by 2037-38, (iii) Reduce cooling energy requirements by 25% to 40% by 2037-38, (iv) recognize “cooling and related areas” as a thrust area of research under national S&T Programme, (v) training and certification of 100,000 servicing sector technicians by 2022-23, synergizing with Skill India Mission. 

ICAP recommends synergies with ongoing government programmes and schemes such as Housing for All, the Smart Cities Mission, Doubling Farmers Income and Skill India Mission, in order to maximize socio-economic co-benefits. It was informed that the Ministry has constituted the Steering Committee and Thematic Working Groups for providing the modalities for operationalization of the recommendations. They have already commenced their work.    

Shri Babul Supriyo further stated that as part of the Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) phase out programme, India has proactively taken the challenge of complete phase out of HCFC 141 b, which is a chemical used by foam manufacturing enterprises by 1.1.2020. Towards meeting this compliance target, the Ozone Cell of the Ministry is providing technical and financial assistance to foam manufacturing enterprises along with UNDP. 

Shri Babul Supriyo informed the gathering that MoEFCC is implementing a project jointly for upskilling and certification of 100,000 Refrigeration and Air-conditioning service technicians with Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) under Skill India Mission - Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). Training and certification of Refrigeration and Air-conditioning (RAC) service technicians will allow securing environmental benefits and livelihood enhancement for technicians. This sector is largely unorganized. Already 20000 service technicians have been upskilled and certified in the first phase. In addition 14, 000 technicians have also been trained under HPMP in collaboration with GIZ. The Minister also released Proceedings of Stakeholder consultation on Strengthening of certification System for RAC servicing technicians and a Special issue of newsletter “newsTRAC” –for technicians in Refrigeration and Air-conditioning (RAC) Sector on Social Security, Access to Finance and Occupational Safety of Servicing Technicians.

The Ministry has also signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET), for providing Competency Enhancement of System Houses and Micro, Small and Medium enterprises (MSMEs) in foam manufacturing sector for ensuring smooth and sustainable phase out of HCFC-141b. 

A booklet on ‘Montreal Protocol – India’s Success Story’ and poster and sticker of award winning students were also released on the occasion of the World Ozone Day. In keeping with the focus on skilling of RAC service technicians and formalization of the RAC service trade four publications related to RAC service sector which have been developed by Ozone Cell, MoEF&CC along with GIZ and UN Environment were also launched today. A booklet on Efficient and Sustainable Cooling and a booklet on Good Servicing Practices for Flammable Refrigerants: A Quick Guide were also released on the occasion. Shri Babul Supriyo also presented awards to students for competitions in painting, poster making and slogan writing organized on World Ozone Day. 



""32 years and healing” is the theme of 25th World Ozone Day celebrations. The theme signifies over three decades of remarkable international cooperation to protect the ozone layer and also the climate system under the Montreal Protocol. The abundance of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) in the atmosphere is declining and a recent study has indicated that the ozone hole is recovering. 

The World Ozone Day celebration was well attended by the representatives of Multilateral and bilateral agencies including UN Environment, UNDP, GIZ, representatives of various Government Departments, Industry and Industry associations and large number of students.

                The 12-day long 14th Conference of Parties (COP14) to United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has come to a close today, with thought-provoking discussions on land management, restoration of degraded land, drought, climate change, renewable energy, women empowerment, gender equality, water scarcity and various other issues. India was the proud host of UNCCD COP14,which witnessed widespread participation from over 9000 participants from all across the globe at India Expo Centre & Mart, Greater Noida from 2nd to 13th September 2019.

Speaking at the Press Conference today on the outcomes of COP14, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Shri Prakash Javadekarexuded confidence that all three Rio conventions will work in synergy.  



 

In an unprecedented global campaign to save productive land, country parties have agreed to make the Sustainable Development Goal target of achieving land degradation neutrality by 2030 a national target for action.

Shri Javadekar reiterated India’s commitment to achieving land degradation neutrality by2030. He also committed to provide an effective leadership to the UNCCD during his two-year tenure of Presidentship.

Countries will address insecurity of land tenure, including gender inequality in land tenure, promote land restoration to reduce land-related carbon emissions and mobilize innovative sources of finance from public and private sources to support the implementation of these decisions at country-level. 

The framework used for reporting action will be improved to ensure it captures key issues, such as gender equality, drought response and the influence of consumption and production patterns and flows on land degradation. Through the Delhi Declaration, ministers expressed support for new initiatives or coalitions aiming to improve human health and well-being, the health of ecosystems, and to advance peace and security. The Environment Minister stated “Delhi Declaration is an ambitious statement of global action by each country on how to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality”. 



 

“To my mind, this was the COP where we put people at the heart of what we do,” said Mr. Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of UNCCD, with Parties adopting a breakthrough decision on land tenure rights and drawing on the unique voices, experiences of youth and women. 

COP 14 also adopted a landmark decision to buttress global efforts to better mitigate and manage the risks of drought and to build resilience.

Mr. Thiaw also highlighted the contribution of COP 14 to the Climate Action Summit, stressing that land restoration, at scale, is one of the cheapest solutions to address the global crises of climate and biodiversity loss. 

Attention was also drawn to the role, the private sector play in land restoration going forward, including through promoting sustainable value chains, as well as the incentives that will draw them in, such as the regulation in support of innovation for sustainable land management and rewarding conservation, restoration and sustainable use of resources.

COP14, ended today after 11 days of meetings, 11 high-level, 30 committee and over 170 stakeholder meetings, 145 side-events and 44 exhibitions.

                The 14th Conference of Parties (COP14) to United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) which is currently underway at India Expo Centre & Mart, Greater Noidadedicated day 10 to the theme of Drought. The success and challenges of the current tools, methodologies and policies supporting drought preparedness, across the globe were discussed in today’s Conference at the Rio Pavilion Centre.

Mr. Ibrahim Thiaw, UNCCD, Executive Secretary in his opening remarks at the Drought Preparedness Day said “Drought is a major obstacle to achieving sustainable development goal-15. We need to move faster in our fight against drought. Let us dust this villain, and mitigate climate change”.The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. The 17 SDGs are integrated—that is, they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. The SDG-15 refers to: Protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

Mr.Rene Castro, Assistant Director- General, Climate, Biodiversity, Land and Water Department, at the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, Ms. SamiaMkrumah, President of Kwame Nkrumah Pan African Centre, Ghana were amongst the key dignitaries.

This event highlighted the different causes of drought and also saw launch of a toolbox which is a one-stop shop for all actions on drought. The toolbox is a sort of knowledge bank which contains tools that strengthen the ability of countries to anticipate and prepare for drought effectively and mitigate their impacts as well as tools that enable communities to anticipate and find the land management tools that help them to build resilience to drought.

The India Pavilion at UNCCD COP14 also witnessed a panel discussion by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on Agriscapes. Mr. Deepak Kumar Sinha, IGF, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and DrVivekSaxena, Country Representative, IUCN India were among the panelists of the session.



In addition, important sessions on issues related to Land Degradation Neutrality, Sustainable Development Goals etc. were conducted.



India is the host country of the ongoing UNCCD COP14 which began from 2ndSeptember and will culminate on 13th September 2019.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the High-Level Segment Meeting of the 14th Conference of Parties (COP14) to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), at Expo Mart, Greater Noida in august presence of Mr.Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines; Ms. Amina Jane Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General United Nations; Mr. Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary, UNCCD; Shri Prakash Javadekar, Union Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC); Shri Babul Supriyo, MoS, MoEF&CC and other dignitaries.



Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister reaffirmed India’s commitment to addressing all the three main concerns of the Rio Conventions. He also stated that India has hosted global gatherings through the CoP’s for all the three Conventions. “Going forward, India would be happy to propose initiatives for greater South-South cooperation in addressing issues of climate change, biodiversity and land degradation”, said the Prime Minister.



During his address, the Prime Minister announced “India would raise its ambition of the total area that would be restored from its land degradation status, from twenty-one million hectares to twenty-six million hectares between now and 2030”. This will be focused on restoring land productivity and ecosystem services of 26 million hectares of most degraded and vulnerable land, with emphasis on the degraded agricultural, forest and other wastelands by adopting a landscape restoration approach.

Shri Narendra Modi also announced India’s proposal to setup a global technical support institute for the member countries of the UNCCD for their capacity building and support regarding the Land Degradation Neutrality Target Setting Program. “I am happy to state that India would be happy to help other friendly countries develop land restoration strategies through cost effective satellite and space technology”, said the Prime Minister.



Acknowledging the importance of the role of water, Shri Narendra Modi called upon the leadership of UNCCD to conceive a global water action agenda which is central to the Land Degradation Neutrality strategy. “When we address degraded lands, we also address water scarcity. Augmenting water supply, enhancing water recharge, slowing down water run-off and retaining moisture in the soil are all parts of a holistic land and water strategy”, said the Prime Minister.  

The Prime Minister also advocated on the need to eradicate the menace of single use plastic, he stated “My Government has announced that India will put an end to single use plastic in the coming years.  I believe the time has come for even the world to say good-bye to single use plastic”.

Shri Prakash Javadekar in his opening remarks lauded the Prime Minister’s efforts towards green activities, “Prime Minister played a leading role in  Paris Summit; he has been the guiding force behind India's ambitious program of achieving 175 GW of renewable energy production”.

The Environment Minister pointed out that the COP14 has emerged as a global platform to discuss matters of great importance concerning the environment, he stated “More than 190 Countries, 100 Ministers and 8000 participants from all across the globe came together to discuss and work on promotion of land restoration and climate resilience at UNCCD COP14”.



The Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Mr Ralph Gonsalves also spoke at length on climate change and desertification. He also acknowledged the Prime Minister for his concerted efforts in addressing these issues. “We all should stand united to resolve the Climate Change issue and make UNCCD COP14 path breaking. I acknowledge the role of Government of India & initiatives of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for environment”.

Noting the five summits to be held in New York soon, Ibrahim Thiaw, UNCCD Executive Secretary, said “the agreements we reach here about how to restore, protect and manage our land on a massive scale and how to trigger a seismic shift in private sector partnerships to make it happen can immediately help ramp up the ambition of action plans for everyone involved”.

Over the past week, various deliberations were conducted on restoration of degraded land, the Environment Minister in a Press Conference later today also announced that the Delhi declaration will be announced tomorrow which will be accountable for the actions by various countries, “The draft Delhi declaration is almost ready, discussions throughout last week was very productive; this is one area where there is more unanimity than divergence of views”.

With focus on strengthening south cooperation in addressing desertification and land degradation for better livelihood, the Environment Minister said “We want to tackle the problems scientifically and therefore we are using ultra-modern technologies with the cooperation of others because ultimately desertification has to be a people’s movement. India is also making positive progress in its actions of climate change”.  Shri Javadekar also stated the various efforts made by the Government to improve efforts towards afforestation, by highlighting the recent distribution of CAMPA funds to various states.



During the meeting, both countries discussed in length and explored opportunities for bilateral cooperation in the area of combating desertification within the framework of UNCCD.





Mr. Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary UNCCD; Mr. L I Bijian, Minister of Chinese Embassy in India; Mr. Ohn Win Union Minister, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation of Myanmar and Mr. Zhang Jianlong National Forestry and Grassland Administration, China, were amongst other dignitaries present during the discussion.

                The fifth day of the 14th Conference of Parties (COP14) to United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) at India Expo Centre & Mart, Greater Noida brought forth discussions on important mattersconcerning how to reverse land degradation.

The UNCCD, the World Future Council (WFC) and IFOAM – Organics Internationalconvenedan event, which pointed out how agro ecology and organic agriculture in India and the Himalayas enhance fertile landscapes, protect biodiversity and improve living conditions of the local people.

Contributing to the objectives of UNCCD’s conference i.e. UNCCD COP14, the event showcased, in particular, innovative policies that support the much needed transformation of food systems in India and the Himalayas, and thereby help achieve the land degradation neutrality target and improve the living conditions of people affected by desertification. Amongst the policies featured are Sikkim as the first 100% organic state in the world, which received the UN backed Future Policy Gold Award in 2018, and the 100% organic farming goals of Bhutan. 

The India Pavilion at the UNCCD COP14 also saw discussion on Renewable Energy in India – towards sustainable energy transition & combating Desertification conducted by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). 

 



Meanwhile, the Rio Conventions Pavilion held a technical session on mapping of Sand and Dust Storms (SDS) with discussions on SDS covering major concerns such as priority in detecting SDS sources, challenges in soil texture information & definition of free surfaces. Events in the Pavilion, which take place throughout the day, focus exclusively on synergies among the Rio Conventions on Climate Change, Biological Diversity and Desertification. 



The Conference also witnessed an interactive session by Committee of the Whole (COW): A working group set up by COP to facilitate discussions on issues concerning landmanagement.



 

India is the host country of UNCCD COP14 beginning from 2nd to 13th September 2019. The Prime Minister, Shri NarendraModi will inaugurate the high-level segment meeting on 9th September, 2019 and will also address the August gathering at the Conference. Union Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Shri Prakash Javadekar earlier stated that good outcomes are expected of the UNCCD which will be notified in the Delhi Declaration.

 

About UNCCD: 

The UNCCD is an international agreement on good land stewardship. It helps people, communities and countries to create wealth, grow economies and secure enough food and water and energy, by ensuring land users have an enabling environment for sustainable land management. Through partnerships, the Convention’s 197 Parties set up robust systems to manage drought promptly and effectively. Good land stewardship based on a sound policy and science helps integrate and accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, builds resilience to climate change and prevents biodiversity loss.

The Convention entered into force in December 1996. It is one of the three Rio Conventions along with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). India became a signatory to UNCCD on 14th October 1994 and ratified it on 17th December 1996.

                The 14th Conference of Parties (COP14) to United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) being held at India Expo Centre & Mart, Greater Noida entered Day 4 of its 12-day long Conference. With COP14 hosting ‘thematic days’ that focus on the different areas of work of the Convention, “Science Day” was observed today, wherein the outcomes from the recent scientific assessments of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Land degradation were featured.“Bringing science and policy together is a lot like trying tomix oil and water. It seems to be impossible. Science is reductionist. It reduces complex phenomenon into their fundamental parts. Scientists are always testing hypotheses, calculating probabilities and reporting uncertainties. Policy making on the other hand is all about synthesis. Combining elements to try and form a coherent whole” said Mr. Ibrahim Thiaw, UNCCD, Executive Secretary, in his welcoming remarks at the Science Day. This segment of the Rio Conventions Pavilion “Science Day” brings together four major scientific assessments on land conducted over the past two years.

In the past four months, there have been two significant reports- Climate Change and Land by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services conducted by the Intergovernmental Platform of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), both pointing that land has transformed significantly,and are testing the limits of its resilience.

Key messages emerging from the Science Day are intended to inform the high-level segment of the 14th Session of the Conference of the Parties of the UNCCD, and to stimulate and equip the science community, land managers and civil society organisations with practical ideas for progressing LDN for multiple benefits.



Meanwhile, African countries came together to address land degradation and migration nexus. “Migration linked to desertification, land degradation and drought is not an issue of the future – it is our current reality from Africa to Asia, through South America and the Pacificislands. We cannot afford not to take immediate action – otherwise the world will face an immense crisis”, said Mrs Mariam TraoreChazalnoel, International Organisation for Migration, Environment and Climate Change Policy Officer,

To address migration driven by land degradation, 14 African countries launched the Initiative of Sustainability, Stability and Security (3S) which aims at restoring land and creating green jobs for migrants and vulnerable groups. The 3S Initiative is starting its implementation phase engaging countries at the highest political level.

In addition, the Secretary,(MoEF&CC),Shri CK Mishra also chaired an Open-Dialogue session on inclusion of activities of civil society organizations within the official programme of work of the Conference of the Parties (COP) at the UNCCD COP14.



India is the host country of UNCCD COP14 beginning from 2nd to 13th September 2019. The Prime Minister, ShriNarendraModi will inaugurate the high-level segment meeting on 9th September, 2019 and will also address the August gathering at the Conference.

                The 14th Conference of Parties (COP14) to United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) which is currently underway at India Expo Centre & Mart, Greater Noida is holding multitude of significant discussions on land management. Some of the key highlights on day-3 of the UNCCDCOP14 include the meeting of the Committee on Science & Technology with a discussion on monitoring framework for the strategic objective on drought. Notable speakers from different countries contributed in the discussion.



The Conference of the Parties (COP) is considering the need for a specific indicator for the strategic objective on drought, which is contained in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) 2018– 2030 Strategic Framework adopted by Parties at the thirteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 13). 

Taking into consideration that the Committee on Science and Technology (CST) assisted in defining and identifying monitoring frameworks for the other strategic objectives, including indicators, the COP requested the CST to assist in the work relating to the establishment of such a monitoring framework. 

The Bureau of the CST, in collaboration with other members of the Science-Policy Interface (SPI), formed a working group to review the options and possible indicators, which are outlined in this document. 



The working group took into consideration relevant work within UNCCD processes and from other associated intergovernmental processes related to the monitoring of drought and the resilience of vulnerable populations and ecosystems to drought, including indicators currently in use at the national level, as reported by Parties to the Committee for the Reviewof the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC), and various reports from other relevant international organizations. 

The working group on drought also took into consideration past decisions of the COP, providing a framework for monitoring and evaluation of UNCCD impact/progress indicators, which allows the COP to set indicators for monitoring, while allowing for refinement, and enhance its potential effectiveness, based on national capacities and circumstances. The working group concluded that there are a wide range of approaches to defining and then monitoring drought.

The Global Mechanism Group held a side event to Launch of Technical Guide on LDN 

Background- The Global Mechanism (GM) was established under Article 21 of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) to assist countries in the mobilization of financial resources to implement the Convention and address desertification, land degradation and drought.

Gender Action Plan: UNCCD Secretariat 

The Convention recognizes the importance of women in the implementation of the Convention, and identifies critical areas for their engagement: (i) awareness-raising, and participation in the design and implementation of programmes; (ii) decision-making processes that men and women adopt at the local level in the governance of development, implementation and review of regional and national action programmes (RAPs and NAPs); and (iii) capacity-building, education and public awareness, particularly at local level through the support of local organizations. 

The TERI School of Advanced Studies also conducted a panel discussion on 'How Green is our Food?' including a case presentation and a session on Land Degradation Neutrality. It is noteworthy to mention that the India Pavilion which has been set up, witnessed today a green film making workshop - CMS Vatavaran (an international film festival and forum on environment and wildlife) on Cold Desertification in the Himalayan Region: Lessons for adaptation & mitigation.



India is the host country of UNCCD COP14 beginning from 2nd to 13th September 2019. Union Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Shri Prakash Javadekar mentioned on the opening day of the Conference that the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate the high-level segment meeting on 9th September, 2019. Shri Javadekar also earlier stated that good outcomes are expected of the UNCCD which will be notified in the Delhi Declaration.

                Union Environment Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar released a report on Status of Tiger Habitats in high altitude ecosystems today in New Delhi. Releasing the report Shri Javadekar said that it is an exciting study as it reveals that even ecology at high altitude is compatible for the tiger growth and we will take inputs from this study to have a high altitude tiger master plan.

 



 

The instant situation analysis study provides the rationale for stepping up high altitude conservation of the tiger, while identifying possible viable habitats, corridor linkages, anthropogenic pressures, and induced landscape level changes for evolving an in-situ conservation roadmap. This study, led by the GTF, with range country governments of Bhutan, India and Nepal, along with conservation partners (WWF and country specific collaborators), has been supported by the Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme (ITHPC) of the IUCN AND dFw. This provides the action strategy for a high altitude tiger master plan, with gainful portfolio for local communities and ensuring centrality of tiger conservation in development, trough an effective coordination mechanism, involving stakeholders and line departments operating within the landscape. 



The habitat of tiger of varied, encompassing several biomes and ecological conditions. However, most of the high-altitude habitats, within the range have not been surveyed for an appraisal of tiger presence, prey and habitat status. Hence, it become important to embark on a said appraisal, involving mapping of the habitat and carrying out a situation analysis for a future roadmap. Tiger habitats in high altitude require protection through sustainable land use, as they are a high value ecosystem with several hydrological and ecological processes providing ecosystem services and adaptation to mitigate the ill effects of climate change. Several high-altitude habitats in South Asia have the spatial presence of tiger, active in-situ efforts are called for ensuring their conservation.

The 12-day 14th Conference of Parties (COP14) to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) begins today at India Expo Centre & Mart, Greater Noida. Briefing media persons, Union Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Shri Prakash Javadekar in presence of Executive Secretary, UNCCD, Mr. Ibrahim Thiaw; MoS, MoEF&CC; Shri Babul Supriyo and other dignitaries, expressed how mass awareness and public participation is the need of the hour. ""Be it climate change or desertification, human actions have a role in disturbing the balance of nature. Now people have realised and therefore we are saying that if human actions have caused some damage, positive human action will undo that and make a better world for future generations"". 



 

 Pointing to an unprecedented global campaign to save productive land, Javadekar said 122 countries, among them Brazil, China, India, Nigeria, Russia and South Africa, which are among the largest and most populous nations on Earth, “have agreed to make the Sustainable Development Goal of achieving land degradation neutrality a national target.” Shri Javadekar also mentioned that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate the high-level segment meeting on 9th September, 2019. 



Talking about the importance of such large scale conferences, Shri Javadekar said, “Coming together at a world platform like this to share good stories and experiences will help the world. We can leapfrog for a good start in each country. Therefore, this UNCCD is very important and we expect some good outcomes which will be notified in Delhi Declaration. Delhi Declaration will form the future course of action.” 


Echoing these sentiments, Mr. Ibrahim, drew attention to the warnings sounded by recent scientific assessments and the growing public alarm at the frequency of weather-related disasters such as drought, forest fires, flash floods and soil loss, but urged delegates to be mindful of the opportunities for change that are opening up, and take action.

Mr. Ibrahim, thanked the Government of India for hosting the International Conference. ""We are very fortunate to be here in India. This is undoubtedly going to be the largest COP ever organised by the UNCCD, said Mr. Ibrahim. 

An estimated 7,200 participants that include ministers and representatives of governments, non-government and intergovernmental organizations, scientists, women and youth from the 197 Parties are expected. They will take around 30 decisions with actions that aim to strengthen land-use policies worldwide and address emerging threats, such as forced migration, sand and dust storms, and droughts.

About UNCCD:                

The UNCCD is an international agreement on good land stewardship. It helps people, communities and countries to create wealth, grow economies and secure enough food and water and energy, by ensuring land users have an enabling environment for sustainable land management. Through partnerships, the Convention’s 197 Parties set up robust systems to manage drought promptly and effectively. Good land stewardship based on a sound policy and science helps integrate and accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, builds resilience to climate change and prevents biodiversity loss.

                Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman met here today  the top brass of the Maharatna and Navratna Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) to review their capital expenditure till date and plans for the next two quarters of this financial year. This meeting was held as part of the series of meetings that the Finance Minister has been having with various stakeholders and the measures that have been taken to accelerate the economic growth rate. The Meeting was attended by Finance Secretary  Shri Rajeev Kumar , Secretary DEA Shri Atanu Chakraborty & Secretary Expenditure Shri GC Murmu & Heads /Representatives  of 32 CPSEs .

The combined capital expenditure by the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and Departmental Undertakings (DUs) such as the NHAI and the Indian Railways contribute in substantial measure to fixed assets creation in the economy.

Public procurement as a percentage of GDP in the country is estimated between 20% to 22%. For a size of Indian economy at USD 2.7 trillion, this amounts to public procurement to the tune of USD 500 billion annually. CPSEs are a major contributor to public procurement of works, goods and services.

Government has introduced performance-based evaluation and has also empowered the Boards of Maharatna and Navratna companies for taking operational decisions. Government wants the CPSEs to double their contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) and be the “third major source” of revenue for the Centre after direct and indirect taxes. CPSEs must make efforts to reduce the country’s imports bill and expanding India’s global strategic reach by 2022.

A major transformation has taken place in the last few years in the way procurement is made in the Government by setting up Government e-Marketplace (GeM) and the Central Public Procurement Portal. This allows procurement to take place in a completely paperless, cashless and system driven e-market with minimal human interface. These platforms help in not only making public procurement efficient and accountable but also enhances resource efficiency.

The participating CPSEs presented their Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) till August 2019 with the Finance Minister and explained their plans for the next two quarters. ONGC has a capex plan of Rs. 32921 crore for FY 2019-20. Its capex till August 2019 was Rs. 8,777 crore which was 26.66% of the total planned capex. Indian Oil Corporation has a capex plan of Rs. 25,083 crore of which 8,173 crore ( 32%) has been spent. NTPC has made CAPEX of Rs. 8490 crore (42%) out of a plan of Rs. 20,000 crore. The CPSEs which participated in the meeting have plans of making capital expenditure of Rs. 50,000 crore in the next quarter. 

The Finance Minister stressed that CAPEX needs to be given a vigorous push in the next two quarters. Therefore, CAPEX plan has to be firmed up and followed up with ground level execution. Ministry of Finance would monitor the capital expenditure regularly. CPSEs must ensure that regular payments are cleared expeditiously as it spurs investment cycle and establish e-Billing portal for enabling stakeholders to track the status of payments. Special efforts must be made to clear dues of MSMEs and resolve cases on the SAMADHAN portal of Department of MSME.

                In order to assess the position of expenditure in the Government, especially capital expenditure, Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman reviewed the position of Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) of select Ministries having large outlays here today. Some Ministries, which include Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of Human Resource Development, receive Grant-in- Aid from the Budget but large part of the expenditure is made to create capital assets such as IITs, AIIMSs etc. The meeting was attended by Secretaries and Financial Advisors of all major Ministries.

To address the growth challenge, Government has been holding wide ranging stakeholder consultations and has taken several steps to provide boost to the economy. Today’s meeting was in continuation of a series of meetings held by Secretary (Expenditure) to review CAPEX as well as to ensure that due payments to contractors, GeM dues and MSME dues are cleared. Another meeting is scheduled tomorrow with the Maharatnas and Navratnas.

Expenditure, both revenue and capital, made by the Union government provides a major boost to aggregate demand. Total expenditure of the Central government for FY 2019-20 through the budget is Rs.27.86 lakh crore. Of this Capital expenditure is budgeted at Rs. 3.38 lakh crore (12.2%) in BE 2019-20 as against revenue expenditure of Rs. 24.27 lakh crore (87.8%). 

During review , the Finance Minister impressed upon the Ministries/ Departments that regular payments must be cleared expeditiously as it spurs investment cycle. She emphasised that all efforts must be made to ensure that outstanding payments are cleared before the festival season. 

Apart from the budgeted allocation under capital head of Rs. 3.38 lakh crore for 2019-20, the total amount given to Ministries/ Departments as Grant in Aid (GIA) for creation of capital assets amounts to Rs. 2.07 lakh crore. Thus the total amount available for CAPEX for 2019-20 is Rs. 5.45 lakh crore. Total CAPEX till August under capital head has been reported at Rs. 1.36 lakh crore (40.28%) and that under GIA has been reported at Rs. 0.82 lakh crore (39.7%) totalling Rs. 2.18 lakh crore (40%). 

Apart from Gross Budgetary Support (GBS), Ministries have been sanctioned Rs. 0.57 lakh crore EBR, out of which Rs. 0.46 lakh crore has been approved. EBR expenditure also adds to the overall capital expenditure of the Government.

While the capital expenditure till August 2019 is around 40% at Rs. 2.18 lakh crore from GBS, the Finance Minister also took stock of the expenditure plans for the next two quarters and directed that Secretaries and the Financial Advisors must closely monitor the execution of capital works and ensure that payments are released on time as to achieve the targeted capital expenditure of Rs. 5.45 lakh crore. She directed that the capital expenditure must be monitored on a monthly basis to ensure that there are no slippages.

Purchases made on GeM platform were also reviewed. For the purchases made by the Central government departments total payment of Rs. 6533.61 crore has been released while state governments have released payments of Rs. 4851 cr. Ministries/ Departments were advised to expeditiously clear payments since large number of vendors on GeM are MSMEs. 

Shri G C Murmu , Secretary (Expenditure) informed that CPSEs had released payment of Rs. 20,157 crore in the last three months. He stated that Department of Expenditure would constantly monitor the progress of large infrastructure projects for the Ministries as well as the CPSEs and further follow-up meetings would be held.  He informed that meetings with the Ministries/Departments to assess RE for 2019-20 and the BE for 2020-21 would be initiated from the middle of October 2019. Ministries/Departments were asked to make accurate assessment of resource requirements and make projections. This would enhance allocative efficiency.

                Since Apr-June (Q1) 2010-11, Public Debt Management Cell (PDMC) (earlier Middle Office), Budget Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has been bringing out a quarterly report on debt management on a regular basis. The current report pertains to the quarter Apr-Jun 2019 (Q1 FY20).

During Q1 of FY20, the Central Government issued dated securities worth ₹2,21,000 crore as against ₹1,44,000 crore in Q1 of FY19. The weighted average maturity (WAM) of new issuances stood at 15.86 years in Q1 of FY20 (14.18 years in Q4 of FY19). The weighted average yield (WAY) of issuances for the same quarter was 7.21 per cent compared to 7.47 per cent in Q4 of FY19. During April-June 2019, the Central Government did not raise any amount through the issuance of Cash Management Bills. The net average liquidity injection by RBI under Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) including MSF was ₹17,599.3 crore during the quarter. 

The total liabilities (including liabilities under the ‘Public Account’) of the Government, increased to ₹88,18,392 crore at end-June 2019 from ₹84,68,086 crore at end-March 2019. Public debt accounted for 89.4 per cent of total outstanding liabilities at end-June 2019. Nearly 28.9 per cent of the outstanding dated securities had a residual maturity of less than 5 years. The holding pattern indicates a share of 40.3 per cent for commercial banks and 24.3 per cent for insurance companies at end-March 2019.

G-Sec yields have softened in Q1 of FY20 with the decrease in weighted average yield of primary issuances to 7.21 per cent from 7.47 per cent in Q4 of FY19 reflecting the impact of several developments namely reduction in policy repo rate twice under the LAF by 25 bps each, OMO purchase auction and a downward movement in the yield on US 10-year treasury bond. The yield on 10-year benchmark G-Sec (7.26% GS 2029) closed at 6.88 per cent on June 29, 2019. Central Government dated securities continued to account for a major share of total trading volumes in the secondary market, with a share of 86.0 per cent in total outright trading volumes in value terms during Q1 of FY20.

                Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs reviewed the performance of the banks, here, today in a meeting with the top management of Public Sector Banks.

Today, FM reviewed at length the implementation of series of measures, following extensive stakeholder consultations, announced since 23.8.2019, including consolidation, to support economic growth. A number of these related to the banking sector and progress in implementation of these was reviewed today with chief executives of Public Sector Banks.

Discussion on the performance of the banks was carried out with focus on supporting credit needs of the economy, in particular the needs of sectors such as NBFCs, HFCs, MSMEs, sectors under stress and enabling better access to cheaper credit. At the end of August 2019, overall credit growth in the banking sector stood at 10.1% on year-on-year basis. This is in parallel with record recoveries and cleaning of bank balance-sheets showing better quality of asset book.

Banks loan disbursement to key sector remains robust, with disbursement of Rs. 11.83 lakh crore done for MSME sector in FY 2018-19 as against Rs. 8.53 lakh crore done in FY 2017-18.  Bank have also continued to support housing sector by disbursing Rs. 2.19 lakh crore for home loans in FY 2018-19 as against Rs. 1.81 lakh crore in FY 2017-18.

Pool buy-out of NBFC/HFC post Sep-18 till 15th Sep-19 was Rs. 93,018 crore, including Rs. 9,155 crore under the newly launched Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme. Proposals of another Rs. 33,200 crore under the new scheme are also in the pipeline.

Following the announcement on 23rd August 2019, banks have already entered into 14 tie-ups with NBFCs for co-originating loans, with another 36 such tie-ups in the pipeline. This will help borrowers in terms of better access to affordable credit, while yielding business benefits to both banks and NBFCs.

Acting upon their commitment to review lending rates in the context of policy rate cuts, Public Sector Banks have effected weighted average rate cuts of 27 basis points till August 2019 and another 10 out of the 18 Public Sector Banks have effected additional rate cuts ranging from 15 to 5 basis points in the current month.

Further, to enable automatic transmission of externally benchmarked rates, 15 Public Sector Banks have already introduced Repo-rate-linked loan products for housing and vehicles, consumer credit, cash credit limits and mortgage-based loans. Already, over 1.08 lakh Repo-linked proposals, amounting to over Rs. 40,000 crore, have been sanctioned. The remaining three Public Sector Banks will also be introducing such products by 1st October. These measures are aimed at considerable improvement in access to affordable credit.

Following up on the earlier announcements on enhancing customer ease for credit wherein online tracking of loan applications and mandatory release of security documents 15 days post loan closure was proposed. Public Sector Banks have passed on instructions upto branch level and process of technology changes to track it electronically is also underway. This will help increase transparency of loan processing for customers.

To boost the resolution process, OTS system has been made more transparent with introduction of check box approach based OTS policy by 11 Public Sector Banks, while remaining banks are at various stages of implementation. This will ensure faster resolution through a non-discretionary and non-discriminatory system.

To support decision-making and to prevent harassment for genuine commercial decisions by bankers, CVC has issued directions that Internal Advisory Committee in banks that would classify cases as vigilance and non-vigilance along with setting up of an advisory Board for first level examination to decide whether the case is a criminal act or a genuine commercial decision and accordingly, recommending the future course of action for large fraud cases above Rs. 50 crore. This will instill a sense of protection among bankers from prosecution for genuine decisions and promote lending and Public Sector Bank heads expressed their resolve to take prudent commercial decision without any fear now.

Since the announcement of consolidation of public sector banks on 30.8.2019, Boards of all ten banks have accorded in-principle approval to the proposals. Heads of concerned banks assured Finance Minister that there will not be any disruption in credit decision making due to process of amalgamation and also that open communication to the employees and customers is being carried out for maintaining business as usual. The employee interests are being protected through best of benefits and learning and growth opportunities for the employees.

                 Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman handed over 12th Century Buddha statue, which was stolen 57 years ago and finally traced at an auction in the United Kingdom (UK), to Shri Prahlad Singh Patel, Union Minister of State (IC) of Culture, here today . Shri Ajay Bhushan Pandey , Revenue Secretary , Senior officers of Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs, Ministry of Culture , Archaeological Survey of India and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence were present on the occasion.

 The 12th Century AD Bronze image of Buddha seated in the Bhumipasara mudra was amongst the 19 bronze images/statues stolen from the Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) Nalanda site museum in August 1961. After a gap of nearly 57 years, in early 2018, the image was spotted by Art enthusiasts at an auction organised by a London based dealer.

On receipt of the information, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) through its attaché posted in High Commission of India, London, UK took up the matter with the ASI, UK Customs and London Metropolitan Police. The ASI confirmed the findings and provided documentary evidence including FIR filed in 1961. International Council of Museums (ICOM) also inspected the image and confirmed that it is the same as the one stolen from Nalanda in 1961.

The Police investigations revealed that the statue changed hands several times before eventually being consigned to a London dealer for sale. Once it was confirmed that the Buddha statue was the same as that stolen from India, both the dealer and the consignor co-operated with the police and decided to return the sculpture to India. UK’s Cultural Department (DCMS) was contacted to facilitate the same through the Metropolitan Police Art and Antiques Unit. The India Pride Project, an online volunteer group of Art enthusiast, played an active role in identification of the idol. The statue was restituted to India and was handed over to the DRI.

                Climate change is one of the most compelling global challenges. The urgency for global climate action cannot be overemphasised. In this background, on 23 September, 2019, the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr António Guterres will host the Climate Action Summit in New York to ramp up the climate actions worldwide. 

India, as a responsible nation, has endeavoured to do its best of its abilities and national circumstances, for adaptation and mitigation actions, keeping in mind the imperatives of sustainable development and poverty eradication. But in order to respond to the worldwide call for stepping up climate actions, it will have to be matched with adequate provision of climate finance from developed countries to developing countries as mandated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and equity. Climate finance is a key pillar in enabling climate actions. The recent estimates for taking climate actions are laying out a case for trillions of Dollars and not billions, in new and additional financing. But the momentum of these flows- the present scope, scale and speed of climate finance, is insufficient and inadequate. Enhanced ambition and enhanced support should be at equal footing. So, a serious discourse on climate finance is undeniable to take climate actions effectively.

Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India has brought out a Discussion Paper titled “Climate Summit for Enhanced Action: A Financial Perspective from India” which examines various issues on climate finance comprehensively - Finance in Climate Treaties, Climate Finance Delivery-A Reality Check, the 3 Essential ‘S’s of Climate Finance- Scope, Scale and Speed, India’s Climate Actions despite Economic Imperatives, Emergence of New “Priorities”, “Ambitions” and “Externalities”– New Asks and Indian Response to Climate Emergency: Some Considerations. The Discussion Paper makes an analysis of the post Paris Agreement developments and indicates that more actions need to be taken to meet objectives of the Agreement, whichin turn depends on the momentum of international climate finance, in terms of new and additionalclimate finance, technological and capacity building support. In essence, the 3 essential “S” s of climate finance has not been clearly translated into reality. 

India’s Nationally Determined Contribution ison a “best effort” basis, keeping in mind the developmental imperatives of the country.So, finance holds a key for all its actions. At this juncture, the provision of technology and finance is uncertain; India can only aspire to implement the already promised climate actions and do equally well or better in comparison to economies with similar levels of development.As Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi put it, ""Earlier, India was walking, but New India will be running."" This means massive infrastructure development in the country. The year 2023 is the time when the global community will do first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement. This is the time, when India will be better placed to consider a mid-term assessment of its actions and suitably recalibrate through re-examination and improvement. For the present, India may only be in a position to elaborate or clarify its post 2020 climate actions already pledged in its NDC.

                CGST Delhi West and CGST Delhi North in a joint operation busted a racket of issuance of invoices without actual supply of goods. The taxpayer availed fraudulent Input Tax Credit for seeking IGST Refunds from Customs formations. Investigations revealed a novel modus operandi wherein the taxpayer showed supplies to SEZ for claiming fraudulent refund from CGST formations.

Devender Kumar Yadav & Sanjeev Maheshwari were the masterminds who created dummy firms and also opened bank accounts. Sh. Bhawani Shanker Sharma, was the accountant who prepared the fake documents and also filed returns on the basis of fake invoices. One person Vinod was shown as proprietor and assisted in the operations of these firms.  All four have been arrested and remanded to Judicial Custody for 14 days by the Duty Magistrate at Patiala House Courts, New Delhi. Prima facie, fraudulent ITC of Rs.195 crores has been passed on using invoices involving an amount of Rs.847 crores.

Investigations revealed around 60 dummy firms were opened in the name of persons belonging to the lower income group. Some of these firms passed on fraudulent Input Tax Credit to firms within this group to avail IGST refund or refund against supplies made to SEZ. The accused had applied for IGST refunds from various ports across India and Rs.18.09 crores had been credited to their bank accounts. Also, three refund claims involving Rs.29.66 crores for supplies made to SEZ were filed in CGST North and West Divisional Offices which had not been sanctioned. During search operations unaccounted cash of Rs.91.92 lakhs was also seized and two bank accounts having amount of Rs.1.68 crores have been provisionally attached.

The accused have committed offence under the provisions of Section 132(1)(b)&(c) of the CGST Act, 2017, which are cognizable and non-bailable under Section 132(5) and punishable under Section 132(1)(i) of the said Act. Accordingly, the four accused were arrested on 14.09.2019 and have been remanded to judicial custody for 14 days.

                In the biggest ever joint operation by Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and Directorate General of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) against exporters who were claiming refund of IGST fraudulently, pan-India searches were carried out at 336 different locations across the country yesterday. The operation covered entities in the states of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh. The joint operation of the two premier intelligence agencies of Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), was a first of its kind in the history of CBIC which involved about 1200 officers from both the agencies.

On the basis of data analytics, an intelligence developed in close coordination by both the agencies revealed that some exporters are exporting goods out of India on payment of tax (IGST), being done almost entirely out of the Input Tax Credit (ITC) availed on the basis of ineligible/ fake supplies. Further, such IGST payment was claimed as refund on export. Based on the data provided by the Directorate General of Analytics and Risk Management (DGARM), analysis was conducted wherein certain ‘red flag’ indicator filters were applied to Customs’ export data in conjunction with the corresponding GST data of the exporters. It was also noticed that there was no or negligible payment of tax through cash by the exporters as well as their suppliers. In few cases, even the tax paid through ITC was more than the ITC availed by these firms. On the basis of this intelligence, massive searches were conducted on the premises of exporters and their suppliers. 

The day long operation revealed that many of the entities spread across the length and breadth of the country were either non-existent or had given fictitious addresses. The preliminary examination of the records/documents resumed during the course of the joint operation along with the statements recorded of various persons indicated that an Input Tax Credit of more than Rs. 470 Crore (Invoice value of approx. Rs 3500 Crores) is bogus/ fake which has been further utilized by the exporters for effecting exports on payment of IGST through ITC and claiming consequential cash refund of the same. Besides, an IGST refund amount of around Rs 450 crore is under examination. Further, some live export consignments of these exporters have been intercepted at Vadodara Rail Container Terminal, Mundra port and Nhava Sheva port for examination in order to ascertain mis-declaration.

 Further investigations in the matter are under progress.

                The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of India today signed a $200 million loan to upgrade rural roads to all-weather standards in 34 districts of Maharashtra State to improve road safety and better connect rural areas with markets and services.

The signatories to the loan agreement for the Maharashtra Rural Connectivity Improvement Project were Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary (Fund Bank and ADB), Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India, and Mr. Sabyasachi Mitra, Deputy Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission, who signed for ADB. The project agreement was signed by Mr. Walter D’mello, Under Secretary, Finance Department and Mr. Pravin Kide, Secretary, Mukhya Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and chief executive officer (CEO), Maharashtra Rural Road Development Association (MRRDA).

“Improving rural connectivity is one of the key priorities of the Government of India, which will help enhance rural livelihoods and alleviate poverty among remote rural communities in project districts,” said Mr. Khare after signing the loan agreement. “Enhanced road connectivity and better access to markets will help the farmers increase agricultural productivity and incomes,” he said.

“The project will improve the condition of about 2,100 kilometers (km) of rural roads to all-weather standards, with climate resilience and safety features, connecting rural communities with productive agricultural areas and socioeconomic centers,” said Mr. Mitra. “Provision of contractual maintenance for 5 years following construction has also been provided under the project,” he said.

Maharashtra has an extensive road network, with rural roads making up two thirds of the network. But more than half of these rural roads are unsealed, making them unsuitable for motorized traffic and impassable during the rainy season. Road safety has been a growing concern with the state accounting for over 8% of all fatal road accidents in India. 

Accompanying the loan is a technical assistance grant of $1 million for institutional strengthening of the MRRDA in areas such as road asset management, road safety, climate-resilient design and construction and web-based real-time project monitoring. Outreach for road users will be carried out in the state to build awareness of road safety, gender issues including human trafficking, and enhancing women’s road construction and maintenance skills.

ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members—49 from the region. In 2018, it made commitments of new loans and grants amounting to $21.6 billion.

                Availability of quality infrastructure is a pre-requisite to achieve broad-based and inclusive growth on a sustainable basis. Investment in infrastructure is also necessary for sustaining the high growth rate of India. 

To achieve the GDP of $5 trillion by 2024-25, India needs to spend about $1.4 trillion (Rs. 100 lakh crore) over these years on infrastructure. In the past decade (FY 2008-17), India invested about $1.1 trillion on infrastructure. The challenge is to step-up annual infrastructure investment so that lack of infrastructure does not become a binding constraint on the growth of the Indian economy. 

Hon’ble Prime Minister in his Independence Day speech highlighted that Rs.100 lakh crore would be invested on infrastructure over the next five years. Infrastructure projects will include social and economic infrastructure projects. To implement an infrastructure program of this scale, it is important that projects are adequately prepared and launched. In pursuance of this, an annual infrastructure pipeline would be developed. To achieve this task, a Task Force under the chairmanship of Secretary (DEA) has been constituted by Union Finance Minister to draw up a National Infrastructure Pipeline for each of the years from FY 2019-20 to FY 2024-25 as below:

			Member
			
		
		
			
			6.

 The Terms of Reference of the Task Force are as follows:


	To identify technically feasible and financially/ economically viable infrastructure projects that can be initiated in FY 2019-20. 
	To list the projects that can be included in the pipeline for each of the remaining 5 years between FY 2021-25. 
	To estimate annual infrastructure investment/capital costs.
	To guide the Ministries in identifying appropriate sources of financing. 
	To suggest measures to monitor the projects so that cost and time overrun is minimized.


 

The National Infrastructure Pipeline would include greenfield and brownfield projects costing above Rs 100 crore each. Other qualifications for inclusion in the pipeline for the current year will include availability of a DPR, feasibility of implementation, inclusion in the financing plan and readiness/ availability of administrative sanction. Each Ministry/ Department would be responsible for monitoring of projects so as to ensure their timely and within-cost implementation. The Task Force will also enable robust marketing of the pipeline of projects requiring private investment through the India Investment Grid (IIG), National Investment & Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), etc. 

 The Task Force will submit its Report on the pipeline for FY 2019-20 by 31st October, 2019 and on the indicative pipeline for FY 2021-25 by 31st December 2019.

                In order to boost capital expenditure of the Union Government so as to pump liquidity in the market to boost demand, Ministry of Finance held meeting with the heads of Maharatna and Navratna Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and Financial Advisors(FAs) of infrastructure Ministries here today. The meeting was Co-Chaired by Shri Atanu Chakraborty , Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs and Shri G.C.Murmu , Secretary Department of Expenditure .

During the meeting following three areas were reviewed

(a) Capital expenditure by various CPSEs & Ministries. They were impressed upon to adhere to the expenditure plan and accelerate investment activities.

(b) Monitoring release of payments for procurements and other contracts without delay to infuse liquidity in a time bound manner.

(c) Resolution of outstanding payments which may have been held up on account of disputes.

Ministry of Finance would constantly monitor the progress of large infrastructure projects for the Ministries as well as the CPSEs and further follow meetings would be held. For this purpose, Ministry will be developing a dashboard for enabling Ministries to upload figures on periodic basis.

During last week, the Secretary (Expenditure) and Secretary (Economic Affairs) also Co-Chaired a meeting with the heads of large CPSEs and officials of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and the Ministry of Public Enterprises.

Government has devised a multi- pronged approach for providing boost to the economy. Merger of some Public Sector Banks and upfront capital infusion of Rs. 70.000 crore were announced recently. It is hoped that enhanced credit flow will spur investment cycle and help revive stressed sectors like housing. Start-ups have been exempted from ‘angel tax’. Distress in the auto sector has also been addressed through a package of measures.

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has entered into 26 Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) in the first 5 months of the current financial year (April to August, 2019). With the signing of these APAs, the total number of APAs entered into by the CBDT as of now stand at 297, which includes 32 Bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (BAPAs).

Out of these 26 APAs, 1 is a BAPA entered into with the United Kingdom and the remaining 25 are Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (UAPAs).

The BAPAs and UAPAs entered into during this period pertain to various sectors and sub-sectors of the economy like Information Technology, Banking, Semiconductor, Power, Pharmaceutical, Hydrocarbon, Publishing, Automobile, etc.

The international transactions covered in all these agreements, inter alia, include the following:- 


	contract manufacturing
	provision of software development services
	back office engineering support service
	provision of back office (ITeS) support services
	provision of marketing support services
	payment of royalty for use of technology and brand
	trading and distribution
	payment of charter charges
	corporate guarantee
	intra-group services
	interest on financial instruments

                A one-day Joint India- NDB workshop on Enhancing NDB’s engagement with the India private and public sector was held here today.

The NDB is the first Multilateral Development Bank established by developing countries and emerging economies — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The mandate of the Bank is to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies and developing countries, complementing the existing efforts of multilateral and regional financial institutions for global growth and development. India is one of the founding members, holding 20% stake in the Bank. The Bank is headquartered in Shanghai. 

As of now, NDB’s approved loan proportion to India is 28%, the second highest after China amongst the BRICS countries. States like Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Assam are receiving funding from the Bank. NDB is now keen on expanding its operation in other states and union territories in India. The Bank is also looking forward to expand its lending to private sector in India. 

The workshop was co-organized by NDB and the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) Ministry of Finance, Government of India. The workshop was co-chaired by Shri K. Rajaraman, Additional Secretary, DEA, Mr. Xian Zhu, Vice President and Chief Operations Officer (COO) of NDB, and was attended by more than 100 representatives from Indian public and private sector, including Ms. Naina Lal Kidwai, Member of BRICS Business Council and Past President of FICCI. 

Additional Secretary, Shri Rajaraman complimented NDB’s flexible business approach and quick turnaround for loan processing. He noted that India will require an investment of about USD 1.30 trillion in the infrastructure sector over the next five years, which will require innovative sources of funding, and that NDB can contribute towards meeting this funding requirement. He mentioned that NDB aims to provide local currency financing options in its member countries and expressed hope that NDB will be able to provide rupee financing in India soon. He encouraged infrastructure developers from both public and private sectors to explore funding opportunities from NDB to finance sustainable infrastructure projects such as urban water supply, solid waste management, smart cities, renewable energy, smart grid, etc. 

Mr. Zhu gave an overview of NDB’s overall operations, as well as its operations in India. He stated that the international credit rating of AA+ is a demonstration of the strong growth and financial strength of the Bank. He affirmed that NDB aims to support the Indian public and private sector for infrastructure development through innovative means such as loans in local currency, guarantees, credit enhancement and equity investments. He added that Indian companies can also participate as contractors in NDB funded projects and can participate in providing consulting services under the project technical assistance.

Ms. Kidwai remarked that NDB can consider raising green bonds for financing water and sanitation projects and also provide credit enhancement to municipalities for raising bonds. Some of the priority areas that NDB can consider financing include transportation (metro, inter-city mobility), digital infrastructure, agriculture (irrigation, agricultural supply chain, storage) and social sector (education, healthcare, skilling). She also expressed hope that NDB may setup a regional center in India very soon to expand its local footprint in the country. 

The workshop included a plenary session covering overview of NDB’s operations, non-sovereign lending policy and procurement opportunities under NDB financed projects. There was also an interactive Q&A session with the participants and one-on-one discussion with NDB officials on potential business opportunities in India.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Infusion of Rs 4,557 crore by Government in IDBI Bank.

 

It will help in completing the process of IDBI Bank’s turnaround and enable it to return to profitability and normal lending, and giving Government the option of recovering its investment at an opportune time.

 

IDBI Bank needs a one time infusion of capital to complete the exercise of dealing with its legacy book. It has already substantially cleaned up, reducing net NPA from peak of 18.8% in June 2018 to 8% in June 2019. The capital for this has to come from its shareholders. LIC is at 51% and is not allowed to go higher by the insurance regulator. Of the Rs. 9,300 crore needed, LIC would meet 51% (Rs. 4,743 crore). Remaining 49%, amounting to Rs. 4,557 crore, is proposed from Government as its share on one time basis.

 

After this infusion, IDBI Bank expects to be able to subsequently raise further capital on its own and expects to come out of RBI’s Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework sometime next year. This cash neutral infusion will be through recap bonds i.e. Government infusing capital into the bank and the bank buying the recap bond from the Government the same day, with no impact on liquidity or current year’s Budget.

 

Background:

Following Cabinet’s approval in August 2018, LIC acquired 51% stake in IDBI Bank. Government continues to be a promoter and holds 46.46% stake.

 

The financial parameters of IDBI Bank have improved considerably during the last one year:


	CRAR has improved from 6.22% as on 30.9.18 to 11.58% as on 31.3.19.
	Net NPA ratio reduced from 17.3% as on 30.9.18 to 10.11% as on 31.3.19 and further to 8.02% as on 30th June 2019
	Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) improved from 69% (30.9.18) to 83% (31.3.19) and further to 88% on 30th June 2019
	Synergy with LIC has enabled access to 29 crore policyholders base spread over 3184 branches and also to 11 lakh agents and 2 lakh employees of LIC.
	Rs.500 crore revenue for FY 2020 and Rs.1,000 crore from FY 2021 onwards projected from LIC Synergy.
	Sale of insurance kick-started in March 2019 with Rs.160 crore premium. This momentum has continued with over Rs. 250 Cr premium collection in first four and a half months of this year. FY 2019-20 target is Rs.2000 crore of premium and Rs. 200 crore revenue.
	Additional business anticipated is Rs.5,000 crore (Housing loan, Auto loan, personal loan) by leveraging LIC agents’ network.

                The Steering Committee on Fintech related issues constituted by the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, today submitted its Final Report to Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in her office in New Delhi. 

The Committee was constituted in pursuance to the announcement made by the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley in his Budget Speech 2018-19 (Para 75). The report outlines the current landscape in the Fintech space globally and in India, studies the various issues relating to its development and makes recommendations focusing on how fintech can be leveraged to enhance financial inclusion of MSMEs with a view to making fintech related regulations more flexible and generate enhanced entrepreneurship. The Committee report also identifies application areas and use cases in Governance and financial services and suggests regulatory upgrades enabling fintech innovations.

The Committee has recommended that the RBI may consider development of a cash-flow based financing for MSMEs, development of an open-API MSME stack based on TReDS data validated by GSTN and a standardised and trusted e-invoice infrastructure designed around TREDS-GSTN integration.

It has also recommended that Insurance companies and lending agencies to be encouraged to use drone and remote sensing technology for crop area, damage and location assessments to support risk reduction in insurance/lending business.

Given the rapid pace at which technology is being adopted primarily by private sector financial services, the Committee recommends  Department of Financial Services(DFS) to work with PSU banks to bring in more efficiency to their work and reduce fraud and security risks. Significant opportunities can be explored to increase the levels of automation using Artificial Intelligence (AI), cognitive analytics & machine learning in their back-end processes.

The Committee has highlighted the positive impact of Fintech innovations on sectors such as Agriculture and MSMEs.  And it has recommended NABARD to take immediate steps to create a credit registry for farmers with special thrust for use of fintech along with core banking solutions (CBS) by agri-financial institutions, included Cooperative societies.

The Committee recommends a special drive for modernisation and standardisation of land records by setting up a dedicated National Digital Land Records Mission based on a common National Land Records Standards with involvement of State Land and Registration departments, with a view to making available land ownership data on an online basis to Financial Institutions.

The Committee also recommends a comprehensive legal framework for consumer protection be put in place early keeping in mind the rise of fintech and digital services.  

It has also recommended adoption of Regulation technology (or RegTech) by all financial sector regulators to develop standards and facilitate adoption by financial sector service providers to adopt use-cases making compliance with regulations easier, quicker and effective. Similarly, it has also recommended that financial sector regulators develop an institutional framework for specific use-cases of Supervisory technology (or SupTech), testing, deployment, monitoring and evaluation.

Further, an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee will be set up on fintech Applications in Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, to continue to carry on the tasks of implementing this report, including exploring and suggesting the potential applications in government financial processes and applications, particularly accounting and asset management, welfare services, taxation, and handling citizen grievances. While the Inter-Regulatory Technical Group (IRTG) set up under the FSDC will be the forum of inter-regulatory coordination on Fintech.

Following the deliberations of the Committee it was considered necessary to have a nodal agency to coordinate developments across Ministries and Regulators in the area of Fintech. A dedicated team on Digital Economy & Fintech is being set up in the Investment Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance for coordination on FinTech with relevant Ministries.

The Steering Committee, which submitted the report, is headed by Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs. The other members of the committee are Secretary (MeitY); Secretary (DFS); Secretary (MSME); Chairperson (CBIC); CEO (UIDAI); Deputy Governor (RBI); Executive Director (SEBI); CEO, Invest India with Additional Secretary (Investment), DEA as the convener of the panel

A copy of the Report of ‘Steering Committee on Fintech related issues’ has been placed on the website of the Department of Economic Affairs today.

                The Income Tax department has made history with a quantum jump in the e-filing of Income–Tax Returns (ITRs) with an all time high record of 49 lakh 29 thousand and 121 ITRs filed in a single day on 31st August 2019. This has perhaps created a history as the tax administration nowhere in the world has achieved such huge online e-filing ITRs in a single day and that too so smoothly; with the IT department actively interacting with taxpayers on social media to help them resolve their grievances and e-filing related queries and getting accolades in return. 

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) today releasing the data on e-filing of ITRs for which last date of submission was 31st August 2019 said that this is a remarkable achievement as taxpayers are experiencing a whole new facet of the I-T department which is not only taxpayers’ friendly but also is of a facilitator providing informational assistance with the pre-filled forms and handholding e-filers besides being proactively responsive on social media to help and guide taxpayers.

CBDT said that setting new records in e-filing on 31st Aug 2019, the peak filing rate per second was at 196 ITRs and peak filing rate per minute was at 7447 ITRs while peak filing rate per hour was at 3,87,571 ITRs. The Information Security team of IT department thwarted over 2205 malicious attacks on the website aimed at disrupting services in the peak period.





CBDT said that as per the data, at  TRACES there were 42,75,913 - 26AS views on 31st  Aug 2019 as compared to highest of 29,94,406 of last year, i.e., almost 43% increase as compared to last year peak views. 

CBDT said that out of the 5.65 Cr ITRs filed so far, 3.61 Cr ITRs have been verified. A large number of taxpayers about 2.86 Cr (79%) have opted for e-verification, mostly using Aadhaar OTP. The I-T Department intends to carry out campaigns to increase awareness about e-verification of ITRs where verification is still pending. 

CBDT further said that taxpayers’ grievances on e-Nivaran, email and on call centre were responded immediately with a turnaround time for twitter being 4 hrs on queries related to e-filing. CBDT also issued two circulars to clarify issues raised by taxpayers, ensuring that taxpayer anxieties were allayed. Social media using Twitter was effectively used to counter fake messages regarding extension of date apart from responding to taxpayers’ queries. Taxpayers would also be educated about the need for linking their bank account with PAN to ensure direct credit of refund to taxpayer bank account through ECS and the requirement for linking PAN with Aadhaar by 30th September 2019. The department was able to effectively counter all perceptions about speed and performance of the website. 



 

Taxpayers appreciated the pre-filled ITRs and mentioned the quickness of filling the ITR in their tweets.



According to CBDT, from the last week of July, the twitter handle of the Income Tax Department, @IncomeTaxIndia was integrated to a landing page to obtain details of taxpayers having last minute grievances. A back end team comprising of helpdesk resources from CPC ITR, E-filing, CPC TDS, PAN, Directorate of Systems was assembled to provide responses within 24 hrs.  The activeness of I-T department on social media and its responsiveness was widely appreciated as given below in some of the tweets:

Government to invest 25,000 Crores in next 5 years for Fisheries development: Shri Giriraj Singh

The last (12th edition of) Handbook was published in 2014.

Addressing the media after releasing the handbook Shri Giriraj Singh said that the Union Government will invest 25,000 crores in the next five years to enhance infrastructure and boost production of fishes in India. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the due importance to this sector by creating a separate Ministry for it. Shri Singh said that Fisheries sector will play a crucial role in the doubling of farmers’ income. He further said that the Ministry will strive to further increase this 14% growth rate in inland fisheries and are working towards creating more awareness among the State governments and the people.

Jeevan Reddy, MLA from Armur constituency of Telangana were also present on the occasion.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Smt. Badal said that the Mega Food Park will leverage an additional investment of about Rs. 250 crore in 22 food processing units in the park and generate a turnover of about Rs. 14000 crore. The Park will also provide direct and indirect employment to 50,000 youth and benefit about 1 lakh farmers. Mega Food parks shall facilitate doubling of farmer’s income by 2022 which is a primary agenda of Govt in the field of agriculture.

 

The Minister said that Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi is an initiative by the government of India in which all small and marginal farmers will get up to ₹6,000. Telangana government also providing financial support to farmers, ultimately the farmer will be benefitted. Mega Food Parks shall further complement the Govt’s scheme by reducing post harvest losses and hedging the farmer’s risk. Mega Food Park shall provide gainful employment to women and hence help support their livelihood, she added.

 

Neem-coated urea can bring better paddy output, I will discuss with the Agriculture Minister about the Neem–coated urea supply issue in Nizamabad district and I try my best to reach the Neem–coated urea to the farmers of Nizamabad, the minister added.

Badal also said that the under the Visionary guidance of Hon’ble Prime Minister ShriNarendraModi, Ministry of Food Processing Industries is focusing on boosting the food processing industry so that agriculture sector grows exponentially and becomes a major contributor to doubling the farmer’s income and ‘Make In India’ initiative of the government.

 

The Mega Food Park Scheme is being implemented in order to give a major impetus to the food processing sector by adding value and reducing food wastage at each stage of the supply chain with particular focus on perishables. Mega Food Parks create modern infrastructure facilities for food processing along the value chain from farm to market with strong forward and backward linkages through a cluster based approach. Common facilities and enabling infrastructure is created at Central Processing Centre and facilities for primary processing and storage is created near the farm in the form of Primary Processing Centers (PPCs) and Collection Centers (CCs). Under the Scheme, Government of India provides financial assistance upto Rs. 50.00 Crore per Mega Food Park project.

 

The Smart Agro Mega Food Park will benefit the people of Nizamabad District and the people of nearby Districts of Nirmal, Jagtial, RajannaSircilla Kamareddy of Telangana &Nanded district of Maharashtra state. This Mega Food Park has been set up in 78 acre of land at a cost of Rs. 108.95 crore.

The Park also has a common administrative building for office and other uses by the entrepreneurs and 3 PPCs at Medak, Gouraram and Nandipethaving facilities for primary processing and storage near the farms.

 

Hon’ble Minister for food Processing Industries said that the modern infrastructure for food processing created at Park will benefit the farmers, growers, processors and consumers of Telangana and adjoining areas immensely and prove to be a big boost to the growth of the food processing sector in the State of Telangana.

 

Smt. Badal also said that the present government is fully committed to providing an environment that is smooth, transparent and easy for investors wanting to start an enterprise in India and in a bid to make India a resilient food economy and the Food Factory of the World, the government has made Food Processing a major thrust area of ‘Make in India’.

                Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, today inaugurated the ‘Arogya Manthan’, a 2-day national workshop organised by National Health Authority (NHA) to mark the first year anniversary of Ayushman Bharat PMJAY, which was launched on 23rd September last year at Ranchi by the Hon. Prime Minister. He said that “Ayushman Bharat with it pillars of Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) is ably fulfilling the Hon. PM’s pragmatic vision of serving the poor and needy, through affordable, quality and accessible healthcare services which are now available close to their own communities, and the assurance component which is totally cashless, and available in any part of the country. 

 

At the event, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that “our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji is a visionary par excellence, and architect of this scheme, which is the largest public health scheme in the world. Under the leadership of Hon. Prime Minister, India has shown that such as large scale health scheme can not only be dreamed of but also successfully implemented”. The stature of India has grown by leaps and bounds in the world under his dynamic leadership, he added. “He has been honoured by the Governments of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, etc., and organisations such as the Gates Foundation recently for his exemplary work. The PM has become a symbol of aspirations of the world today”. The visionary Prime Minister has inspired multitude of people- centric public health interventions, he added. He also stated that more than 12 crore toilets have been constructed in the country under Swachch Bharat Abhiyaan. Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated that earlier, the sanitation coverage was not even 30%, while today it is more than 95%. “It’s because of the commitment of our Prime Minister that more than 5,90,000 villages in the country have been declared open defecation free,” he stated.  Dr Harsh Vardhan further said that more than 8 crore connections have been given to the people under the under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and more than 37 crore accounts have been opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana through financial inclusion of the poor people. “Now the benefits of the government scheme directly reach the bank accounts of people who deserve it the most, something that was considered almost unthinkable some years ago,” the Union Health Minister said.

 

Highlighting a key salient feature of Ayushman Bharat PMJAY, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that it is being governed on a zero-tolerance approach towards any kind of fraud, and the anti-fraud framework rests on three key pillars of prevention, detection and deterrence. “We have de-empanelled 111 hospitals on charges of corruption and fraud. We are following the policy of Name and Shame, the de-empanelled hospitals’ names have been put on the NHA website. We will not tolerate anything that will hamper the integrity of the scheme,” Dr Harsh Vardhan stressed. NHA is currently building PM-JAY 2.0, the new and upgraded IT ecosystem that will be comparable to the best, anywhere in the world.

 

While delivering the presidential address, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that the scheme is for more than 50 crore people and they need to have access to quality healthcare whether provided by the government or the private sector. “It is the government hospitals which provide healthcare services in the remotest areas of the country which have no private hospitals”, he stated. “The idea of excluding government hospitals from the ambit of Ayushman Bharat is absolutely absurd and needs to be rejected”, he emphatically stated.

 

Dr Harsh Vardhan suggested that hospitals that have done exemplary work shall be rewarded through a ‘Name and Fame’ approach, and their names to be displayed on the NHA website. He added that recently NHA has overhauled the existing health benefits packages and rationalized the cost of the packages to remove any aberrations, and to encourage wider private sector participation.

 

Speaking at the function, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated that Ayushman Bharat is a game changer in the health sector. He added that the scheme is ensuring accessible and equitable quality health care to the marginalized and vulnerable sections. He said that ‘sarve santu niramaya’ i.e. “Health for All” is the policy mandate of the Government and Ayushman Bharat will ensure realising the same through its twin pillars of Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs) and PMJAY.

 

Dr Harsh Vardhan released an Annual Report of the NHA and a document on ‘Best Practices and Innovation’. He also presided over the exchange of MoU between NHA and Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) hospitals. He also felicitated Shri Ashit Kumar Modi, producer of Tarak Mehta ka Ulta Chasma, for highlighting PMJAY in one of its episodes. 

 

Dr Vinod K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) and Shri Indu Bhushan, CEO, NHA, along with senior officials from various States, representatives from Development Partners, State Health Authorities, private hospitals, health insurance companies and the media were also present.

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare today launched the new TB Harega Desh Jeetega Campaign, along with the National TB Prevalence Survey. Multi-stakeholder and community participation shall form the pivot of the countrywide campaign. “As part of our commitment to end-TB, we have established patient forums in over 95 per cent of all districts in the first 100 days, which clearly shows our strong commitment to ending TB in the shortest time. These district forums will bring the voices of the affected to the fore, and highlight on-ground challenges faced by patients and their families in accessing TB care services”, he stated. 

The Union Health Minister also flagged off a van for the National TB Prevalence Survey. In all, 25 such vans will be part of the prevalence survey, which shall take 6 months and be carried out across the country. This shall present national and state level data, which will be used as a policy tool for further interventions.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also released the TB India Report (2019), the Work Place Policy Framework for TB, Operational Guideline for Employer Led Model on TB, Training module for transforming TB survivor to TB champion, and Elected Representative’s Handbook on TB. In addition to these, as an important step, the Union Health Minister also launched an all oral regimen kit for multi-drug resistant TB patients which does not include injections which are painful and can have side effects. He also announced a partnership with the World Bank which is providing a $400 million credit for accelerating TB response in 9 states through private sector engagement and other critical interventions. Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State (HFW) was also present at the launch of the campaign.

Highlighting some of the key features of the new TB control campaign, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated its three strong pillars include clinical approach, public health component and active community participation. Other supporting elements of the campaign comprise private sector engagement, patient support, and political and administrative commitment at all levels. He added that the Government is committed to ensuring all patients, irrespective of where they seek care (private sector included), receive free-of-cost, high quality TB care. “In line with the Honourable Prime Minister’s vision, we have introduced pivotal initiatives that are changing the way we diagnose, treat and prevent TB, and are on track to achieving our target of a TB-free India by 2025, much ahead of the global target of 2030,” he said.

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that we have now more than 300 TB Champions in the TB program. He applauded the courage of Ms. Chinmayi from Odisha who narrated her story of fighting brain TB, and how she turned into a strong advocate and supporter for efforts for TB control. “TB survivors like Chinmayi and many others who have shown exemplary courage to follow the course of treatment, should be given the opportunity to lead the way”, Dr Harsh Vardhan said. The Union Health Minister further added that India’s campaign to eradicate polio could be successful because of the thousands of volunteers who contributed to the cause. “Who were these people? These were people from all walks of life - doctors, leaders, health workers, community members, faith-healers - and with their sustained and dedicated effort, India managed to eradicate polio. What we did with Polio then, we need to do with TB now,” he stressed.

Dr Harsh Vardhan also awarded states for their excellent performance in tackling TB. Among states with a large population (>50 lakhs), Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat were awarded as best performers, while Tripura and Sikkim were recognized for their efforts among medium population (less than 50 lakhs) states. Puducherry, and Daman and Diu were judged as the best performers among Union Territories.

The new TB campaign aims to improve and expand the reach of TB care services across the country, by 2022. This includes preventive and promotive approaches, and proposes potentially transformative interventions such as engagement with private sector health care providers, inter-ministerial partnerships, corporate sector engagement, latent TB infection management, and community engagement. The interventions will be accompanied by a comprehensive, mass media and communications campaign to generate awareness about the disease and the free treatment services available under the government program. The media campaign was also launched by the Health Minister today.

In the past few years, there have been several important policy initiatives, resulting in an increase in the number of cases reported to the government. In 2018, 21.5 lakh TB cases were reported to the government, compared to 18 lakhs in 2017, an increase of 17% in one year. Moreover, notifications from private sector health care providers reached 5.4 lakhs, an increase of 40%, contributing to 25% of all TB notifications. The Government of India has also partnered with the Global Fund to launch JEET (Joint Effort for Elimination of TB), a private sector engagement program operating in 45 cities across the country. In the last year, with domestic resources, the Govt. of India through the NHM has also approved additional 120 cities across 19 states.

In April 2018, the government launched the Nikshay Poshan Yojana, a direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme to provide nutritional support to TB patients. Under the scheme, TB patients have been receiving Rs. 500 per month for the entire duration of treatment. Since its inception, a total amount of Rs. 427crore has been paid to over 26 lakhs beneficiaries through direct transfers to their bank accounts.

Dr Vinod K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog; Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW); Dr Balram Bhargava, DG ICMR & Secretary (DHR); Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Special Secretary (HFW); Dr Sanjay Tyagi, DGHS; Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to India, Mr. Jorge Coarasa, Program Leader, World Bank and representatives of other UN organisations were also present at the event.

                “We have to take this movement to every village and to every child and ensure that India becomes free of single use plastic.” This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare at an event organized by FSSAI as a part of ‘Swachhata Hi Seva 2019’ at Prayas Children’s Home in Jahangirpuri, New Delhi, today. The Union Health Minister further stated that if everybody takes the responsibility then this could be achieved. At the event, 22 of the top food companies including multinational companies committed themselves to effectively managing plastic waste in their operations and to reduce their plastic footprint in the coming years. They also signed a pledge to re-affirm their commitment.

Citing the example of polio to highlight multi-stakeholder approach, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated “All of us have to take up this responsibility in our own capacities. I believe that together we will be able to develop new approaches to combat challenges to both health and the society,” he added. Highlighting the critical importance of a Jan Andolan on issues around food safety, Dr Harsh Vardhan reminded the participants about ‘Green Good Deeds’ and said that ‘Green Good Deeds’ are small positive actions to be performed by individuals or organisations to strengthen the cause of environmental protection.  “We have drawn up a list of over 700 Green Good Deeds and asked people to alter their behaviour to Green Good Behaviour to fulfil their Green Social Responsibility. These small, positive actions which include shunning the use of single-use plastic, to be performed by individuals or organisations will strengthen the cause of environmental protection, he stated. He also mentioned that we all should do our own bit as responsible citizens of the society and it is our duty to gift the future generations a cleaner and greener environment. In addition, he also mentioned that we must continue to work in this direction and only stop when each household is plastic waste free and help achieve the Hon. Prime Minister’s vision of a Naya Bharat (New India).

Dr Harsh Vardhan, who is also the Minister for Science & Technology, stated that scientists at the Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun have used technology to successfully convert one tonne of plastic waste into 800 litres of diesel every day.  Such initiatives shall have multi-fold benefits, with reducing the plastic waste in the country, while also making it worthwhile and financially viable for the ragpickers to collect plastic waste which can be converted into fuel.

The event organized at Prayas Children's Home and Skilling-Livelihood Centre, Jahangirpuri in North-East Delhi aims to give a big push to the move on plastic waste free India with support of various stakeholders including policy makers, food and beverage sector, industry associations, celebrities and consumer organizations. The Prayas Centre houses some of the most deprived children, women and youth including large number of rag pickers from all parts of Jahangirpuri, which is one of the largest resettlement colonies. It is also one of the largest collection, sorting and distribution centre of ragpickers in Delhi. The venue was chosen in order to sensitize the key partners about the challenges of plastic waste collection and segregation.

About 200 children, citizens and other partners participated in the event. Children from Prayas staged a play on ‘disadvantages of use of plastic’ along with a dance performance on FSSAI’s theme song on plastics, which was also launched during the event. FSSAI has adopted the theme song “Tik Tik Plastic” first released by Bhamla Foundation. This foot-tapping song reiterates the need for a plastic waste free India and is sung by several renowned singers and musicians. Additionally, FSSAI also organized a food donation drive at Prayas through a food donation agency MCKS Food for Hungry Foundation, New Delhi, which is a part of its ‘Save Food, Share Food’ initiative.

Before taking up this agenda, FSSAI has itself taken up a drive for reduction, and where possible elimination, of plastics in its head office and offices across the country. It has initiated a collection and segregation drive at its own head office in New Delhi. FSSAI has mobilized several food businesses to organize similar activities at their campuses and engage their workforce, thereby ensuring a wider reach. It has also asked all its regional offices and State/UTs food safety departments to conduct awareness and collection drives at public places in their State capitals and major cities during ‘Swachhata Hi Seva 2019’ campaign period.

Also present at the event were Shri Pawan Agarwal, Chief Executive Officer (FSSAI), Shri Amod K. Kanth, founder of Prayas, along with over 200 stakeholders from the Government, food businesses and corporates, and various partners.

                “The Government of India is committed to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and through our Ayushman Bharat(Long Live India) Scheme we are well on our way to achieve it by reducing inequalities in access to inpatient care, reducing the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures, and improving access and quality of health services in the public and private sectors. I am happy to announce that in a short period of time, under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, more than 21,000 Health & Wellness Centres have become operational and in the first year since its launch, about 4.7 million (47 lakh) people have availed of treatments under its Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) pillar which provides health assurance cover to the most needy people of the country”. This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare during his interaction with the media at the Foreign Correspondents' Club in New Delhi to mark the successful completion of one year of the Ayushman Bharat-PMJAYscheme. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated that Ayushman Bharat is the vision of the Hon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji to provide health care to the poor and vulnerable Indians, who need it the most. The Union Health Minister quoted Hon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had said that “Ayushman Bharat scheme is going to transform the health sector. It will provide top quality healthcare to the poor”. He further stated that in designing and implementing this scheme, India has drawn from the experience of other middle-income countries that have undertaken major health financing reforms towards achieving universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.8 related to UHC.  

Highlighting the scheme, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that it is probably the biggest public healthcare initiative in the world. While the 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres (to be operationalised by December 2022) provide comprehensive primary care (CPHC) including preventive and promotive healthcare close to the communities, PMJAY covers about 550 million poor and vulnerable Indians. It provides a health assurance cover over USD 7000 (INR 500,000) per family per year for secondary and tertiary care for serious and catastrophic illnesses. PMJAY provides cashless and paperless access to services for the beneficiary at the point of service. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated that this year, as we complete one year of launch of Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY scheme, about 4.7 million people have availed of treatments worth over USD 1070 million (INR 75000 million). Of the total amount utilised, 55% has been on tertiary procedures that were not covered under the predecessor scheme that primarily focused on secondary care. In addition, more than 102 million beneficiary cards have been issued Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated that under PMJAY, nearly 18,100 hospitals have been empanelled across the country. Of this, 53% of the hospitals empanelled are private, especially multi-specialty, and 62% of the treatments have been in these private hospitals. A unique feature of PMJAY is its portability, which has helped the eligible poor and migrant workers to seek treatment outside their states. So far, there have been more than 40,000 portability cases, he informed. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan informed the foreign correspondents that Ayushman Bharat PMJAY will create the world’s best health assurance program on an efficient and technologically robust eco-system, and thus ensure financial protection against catastrophic health expenditure and access to affordable and quality healthcare for all. PMJAY is the world’s largest fully Government funded health insurance scheme. India has chosen to fund Ayushman Bharat PMJAY exclusively from general government revenues, without any contributions from the population, an approach adopted by several countries including Mexico, Thailand and Turkey.   He said that as on date, 32 States and Union Territories are implementing Ayushman Bharat PMJAY.  In the true spirit of cooperative federalism, NHA and States have worked with a strong partnership approach. Keeping in mind variations across the States, a lot of flexibility has been built in the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY design, and the scheme provides a lot of flexibility to States in terms of scheme design and implementation. 

The Union Health Minister added that recently the Governing Board of the National Health Authority (NHA) decided to overhaul the existing health benefits packages and rationalize the cost of the packages to remove any aberrations. This will ensure wider private sector participation by empanelling more hospitals to improve access to hospitalization related care. We also approved an upgrade to our IT system to make it even more user-friendly, interoperable, secure and state-of-the-art, he stated. Initiatives for improving the quality of services were also endorsed, Dr Harsh Vardhan said.

The Union Health Minister mentioned that the entire backbone of the scheme lies with maintaining the security and privacy of beneficiaries’ personal and sensitive personal data, such as Aadhaar information, personal health records, financial information etc. He added that Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY has a well-designed, robust and multilayered security system with the appropriate application of the best available technology as per the international standards to holistically safeguard the Health Information of its beneficiaries and NHA is currently building PM-JAY 2.0, the new and upgraded IT ecosystem of Ayushman Bharat PMJAY. 

“NHA has a comprehensive anti-fraud policy that draws on global and national experiences including six country (U.S, Indonesia, Philippines, Turkey, Korea and Croatia) case studies and four Indian state case studies (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana). Ayushman Bharat PMJAY is being governed on a zero-tolerance approach towards any kind of fraud, and the anti-fraud framework rests on three key pillars of prevention, detection and deterrence. A total of 97 errant hospitals have been de-empanelled and penalties worth more than USD 214000 or INR 15 million have been levied”, Dr Harsh Vardhan said. He  added that NHA has recently launched an initiative of quality certification standards and a process for digital quality certification for Ayushman Bharat PMJAY empanelled hospitals which will be an independent exercise carried out by Quality Council of India. Keeping in mind the poor and vulnerable beneficiaries, Ayushman Bharat PMJAY has a holistic beneficiary empowerment system, which is implemented via call centre, auto SMS, PMJAY website, self help portal, Central Grievance Redressal System, Prime Minister’s letter, PM-JAY mobile app.  “The website and call centre with toll-free helpline no. 14555 have significantly helped in guiding patients to seek healthcare as well as to send their feedback and grievances for timely redressal. On an average, three calls are being answered every minute at the call centre”, the Health Minister mentioned.

Elaborating further, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that in the long run, the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY, through its system of incentives, aims to expand the availability of services. With greater demand, the private sector is likely to expand in the unserved areas of Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. For public hospitals, PMJAY provides incentives to prioritise poor patients and provides means to generate additional revenue for strengthening their infrastructure and fill their service delivery gaps. “This will give a thrust towards achieving the commitment to UHC. We are aware that the road to UHC is a long journey, and we are taking stock of global lessons and learning from experiences in other countries to continuously reform our approach,” he stated.

The Union Health Minister also stated that to mark the first year anniversary of Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY, the National Health Authority is organizing a 2-day national workshop, Arogya Manthan, on September 30th and October 1st, 2019. In the Arogya Manthan, all important stakeholders of PMJAY will meet and discuss through day-long sessions and working groups to come up with implementable solutions to the challenges faced in the past year in the implementation of the scheme and to forge new understanding and pathways towards improving implementation.

Informing about the primary pillar of Ayushman Bharat, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that through more than 21,000 AB-HWCs, the service area population [around 50 million (5 crore) population empanelled to these centres] are getting out patient service besides the assured maternal and child healthcare services and management of common ailments through newly posted, trained and appropriately oriented Community Health Officers (CHOs). The operational AB-HWCs have a footfall of 1,70,63,522 patients till date. He stated that AB-HWCs will help to provide an enabling environment to increase the health seeking behaviour of the poor people; contribute towards reducing the out of pocket expenditure of the common people; create an assured system of continuum of care model (well-defined referral chain); help in increasing the trust of the people on the service provision by public healthcare facilities through health system strengthening and improvement; and enhance awareness to the people on preventive and promotive healthcare, yoga, healthy lifestyle and eat right & eat safe etc.

Further elaborating on the benefits that have accrued from the AB-HWCs, the Health Minister stated that more than 15 million (1.5 Crore) population is screened for hypertension and more than 7 million (70 lakhs) people are put on treatment; similarly, around 13 million (1.3 crore) population are screened for Diabetes and more than 3.1 million (31 lakhs) people are on treatment. Similarly, for suspected cases for the three common cancers (breast, cervix and oral), they are referred to the higher public healthcare facilities for diagnosis and treatment. He added that more than 7.6 million (76 lakhs) population is screened for oral cavity cancer and out of these, 10,218 people are on treatment.  While more than 5.3 million (53 lakhs) women is screened for breast cancer and around 9700 women are on treatment, more than 3.7 million (37 lakhs) women is screened for cervical cancer and around 10000 women are on treatment. In addition, more than 16 million (1.6 Crores) have been provided medicines and around 4.9 million (49 lakhs) population are provided diagnostic services. Dr Harsh Vardhan also informed that tele-consultation services to the people with the qualified medical officers and specialists for cases referred from Sub Health centre level and PHC level respectively will be introduced shortly. A pilot is being done with eSanjeevani application of C-DAC, Mohali in Gujarat; after the due security audit, it will be rolled out in all functional AB-HWCs in phased manner.

                In a major health and wellness initiative for the country, the Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Promulgation of the Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (production, manufacture, import, export, transport, sale, distribution, storage and advertisement) Ordinance, 2019.

Electronic-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that produce aerosol by heating a solution containing nicotine, which is the addictive substance in combustible cigarettes. These include all forms of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, Heat Not Burn Products, e-Hookah and the like devices. These novel products come with attractive appearances and multiple flavours and their use has increased exponentially and has acquired epidemic proportions in developed countries, especially among youth and children.

Implementation:

Upon promulgation of the Ordinance, any production, manufacturing, import, export, transport, sale (including online sale), distribution or advertisement (including online advertisement) of e-cigarettes shall be a cognizable offence punishable with an imprisonment of up to one year or fine up to Rs. 1 lakh or both for the first offence; and imprisonment of up to three years and fine up to Rs. 5 lakh for a subsequent offence. Storage of electronic-cigarettes shall also be punishable with an imprisonment up to 6 months or fine up to Rs 50,000 or both.  

The owners of existing stocks of e-cigarettes on the date of commencement of the Ordinance will have to suomoto declare and deposit these stocks with the nearest police station. The Sub-Inspector of Police has been designated as the Authorized Officer to take action under the Ordinance. The Central or State Governments may also designate any other equivalent officer(s) as Authorized Officer for enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance.



MAJOR IMPACT:

The decision to prohibit e-cigarettes will help protect population, especially the youth and children, from the risk of addiction through E-cigarettes.   Enforcement of the Ordinance will complement government's efforts for tobacco control and will help in reduction of tobacco use and reduction in associated economic and disease burden.

BACKGROUND:

The current decision has come on the back of an advisory issued by the Government in 2018 to all States to consider banning e-cigarettes. 16 States and 1 UT have already banned e cigarettes in their jurisdictions. Notably, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in a recent white paper on the subject, also recommended a complete ban on e-cigarettes based on currently available scientific evidence. The WHO has also urged member countries to take appropriate steps including prohibiting these products. These products are usually marketed as being safer alternatives for conventional cigarettes but such notions of safety are false. On the other hand, available literature suggests that these products may act as gateway products to induce non-smokers, especially youth and adolescents, to nicotine-use, leading to addiction and subsequent use of conventional tobacco products. E-cigarettes are usually promoted by the industry as smoking cessation aids but their efficacy and safety as a quitting aid has not yet been established.

Unlike the tried and tested nicotine and non-nicotine pharmacotherapies that are known to help people quit tobacco use, the WHO does not endorse e-cigarettes as cessation aids. The possibility of tobacco industry interference in tobacco cessation efforts through misinformation about the potential benefits of these products, which are presented as alternatives but in most cases are complementary to the use of conventional tobacco products, also is a present and real possibility. Apart from nicotine, e-cigarettes may also be used for delivery of other psychoactive substances. Scientifically proven nicotine replacement therapies, without the risks associated with e-cigarettes, exist in the form of gums, lozenges and patches for those willing to quit tobacco use. Widespread use and unchecked proliferation of e-cigarettes and the like devices would seriously undermine and derail Government's efforts to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use.

Considering the highly addictive nature of nicotine; safety concern of flavours in combination with nicotine; risk of use of other psychoactive substances through these devices; initiation of nicotine or psychoactive substances by non-smokers, especially adolescents and youth; dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes; scant scientific evidence for use of e-cigarettes as effective tobacco cessation aids; threat to country's tobacco control efforts; hindrance in achieving the targets envisaged under Sustainable Development Goals, National Monitoring Framework for Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases and National Health Policy, 2017; and in overall interest of public health as envisaged under Article 47 of the Constitution of India, the decision has been taken to prohibit/ban e-cigarettes including all forms of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems [ENDS), Heat Not Burn Products, e-Hookah and the like devices.

                “The Ayushman Bharat journey which began on 14th April 2018 with the inaugural of a HWC at Jangla, a remote place in Chattisgarh, culminated in the launch of the second pillar of Ayushman Bharat- the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) on 23 Sept, 2018 in Ranchi, Jharkhand. I am happy to announce that in a short period of time, under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, more than 21,000 Health & Wellness Centres have become operational and about 47 lakh people have availed of treatments under its Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) pillar”. This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare, as he addressed the media announcing the launch of the Ayushman Bharat Pakhwara, a fortnight of enhancing awareness about the Yojana, the salient features of its twin pillars, and the benefits that can be availed of. He added that “This year, as we complete one year of launch of AB-PMJAY, we are celebrating Ayushman Bharat Pakhwara (15th-30th September), a fortnight-long national campaign to enhance awareness around the preventive, promotive and curative aspects of health care, nutrition, yoga and healthy lifestyle through Ayushman Bharat and other related initiatives such as Poshan Abhiyaan and Swachhta Abhiyaan.

Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated that the flagship scheme of the Government, Ayushman Bharat is the vision of the Hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji to provide universal health care to the poor, needy and vulnerable sections of the country, who most need it. A path-breaking approach and a game-changer, it is probably the biggest public healthcare initiative in the world, he stated. While the 1.5 lakh Health & Wellness Centres (to be operationalised by Dec 2022) provide comprehensive primary care (CPHC) including preventive and promotive healthcare close to the communities, PMJAY covers 50 crore poor and vulnerable people in the country. It provides a health assurance cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care for serious and catastrophic illnesses, he elaborated. PM-JAY provides cashless and paperless access to services for the beneficiary at the point of service.

Through more than 21,000 AB-HWCs, the service area population (around 5 crore population empanelled to these centres) are getting out patient service besides the assured maternal and child healthcare services and management of common ailments through newly posted, trained and appropriately oriented Community Health Officers (CHOs). The operational AB-HWCs have a footfall of 1,70,63,522 patients till date. Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that AB-HWCs will help to provide an enabling environment to increase the health seeking behaviour of the poor people; contribute towards reducing the out of pocket expenditure of the common people; create an assured system of continuum of care model (well-defined referral chain); help in increasing the trust of the people on the service provision by public healthcare facilities through health system strengthening and improvement; and enhance awareness to the people on preventive and promotive healthcare, yoga, healthy lifestyle and Eat Right & Eat SAFE etc.

Further elaborating on the benefits that have accrued from the AB-HWCs, the Health Minister stated that more than 1.5 Crore population is screened for hypertension and more than 70 lakhs people are put on treatment; similarly, around 1.3 crore population are screened for Diabetes and more than 31 lakhs people are on treatment. Similarly, for suspected cases for the three common cancers (breast, cervix and oral), they are referred to the higher public healthcare facilities for diagnosis and treatment. He added that more than 76 lakhs population is screened for oral cavity cancer and out of these, 10,218 people are on treatment.  While more than 53 lakhs women is screened for breast cancer and around 9700 women are on treatment, more than 37 lakhs women is screened for cervical cancer and around 10000 women are on treatment. In addition, more than 1.6 Crores have been provided medicines and around 49 lakhs population are provided diagnostic services. Dr Harsh Vardhan also informed that tele-consultation services to the people with the qualified medical officers and specialists for cases referred from Sub Health centre level and PHC level respectively will be introduced shortly. A pilot is being done with eSanjeevani application of C-DAC, Mohali in Gujarat; after the due security audit, it will be rolled out in all functional AB-HWCs in phased manner.

The Health Minister further stated that since the launch of PMJAY on 23rd Sept last year by the Hon. Prime Minister, more than 47 lakh hospital treatments worth over Rs 7,500 crore have been carried out. Of the total amount utilised, 55% has been on tertiary procedures. In addition, more than 10 crore beneficiary cards have been issued. As on date, 32 States and Union Territories are implementing the PMJAY. Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated that under AB-PMJAY, 18,073 hospitals and health care providers have been empanelled across the country. Of this, 53% of the hospitals empanelled are private, especially multi-speciality, and 62% of the treatments have been in these private hospitals. A unique feature of PMJAY is its portability, which has helped the eligible poor and migrant workers to seek treatment outside their states. So far, there have been more than 40,000 portability cases, he informed.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan added that “Through its vision and design, we have been able to bring on board nearly all States and Union Territories and get whole-hearted political and administrative support for it. This is a demonstration of our commitment to the highest ideals of cooperative federalism”.

The Health Minister added that recently the Governing Board of the National Health Authority decided to overhaul the existing health benefits packages and rationalize the cost of the packages to remove any aberrations. This will ensure wider private sector participation by empanelling more hospitals to improve access to hospitalization related care. We also approved an upgrade to our IT system to make it even more user-friendly, interoperable, secure and state-of-the-art, he stated. Initiatives for improving the quality of services were also endorsed, Dr Harsh Vardhan said.

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that a strong fraud prevention, detection and control system is proving to be critical for PM-JAY, to ensure that frauds are largely prevented and even if they are attempted, they are quickly detected and strong action is taken. Due to the policy of zero tolerance towards corruption, 97 errant hospitals have been de-empanelled and penalties worth more than Rs.1.5 crore have been levied. Besides providing good healthcare services, the scheme is also progressing to achieve its vision of increasing employment in the health sector. He stated that an indigenous healthcare setup is coming up across India, and the infrastructure will develop further, especially in tier II and tier III towns. In the last one year, the scheme has started to create thousands of jobs across the healthcare sector in India, and many more will be created in the coming years.

The Union health Minister also stated that to mark the first year anniversary of PMJAY, the National Health Authority is organizing a 2-day national workshop, Arogya Manthan, on September 30th and October 1st, 2019. In the Arogya Manthan, all important stakeholders of PM-JAY will meet and discuss through day-long sessions and working groups to come up with implementable solutions to the challenges faced in the past year in the implementation of the scheme and to forge new understanding and pathways towards improving implementation.

                “It is such a great coincidence that Jagga and Balia will reach home on 7th September and Chandrayaan II will also touch the moon on the same date. It’s not only India’s scientists that are doing India proud, it is the commendable determination and commitment of the doctors also that is making India proud. This rarest of the rare surgery is one such shining example. It can be called “AIIMS Delhi Jagga and Balia craniopagus surgery”. This was stated by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare and President AIIMS, New Delhi as he interacted with the media, here today, on the day when the two twin brothers prepare to leave for their home in Odisha after a successful surgery to separate them at AIIMS, New Delhi. Dr. (Prof.) Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. (Prof.) S.S. Kale, HoD, Department of Neurosurgery; Dr. (Prof.) Deepak Gupta, Professor of Neurosurgery and head of the team; Dr (Prof) Sheffali Gulati, Department of Pediatrics-Neurology along with other experts who were part of the team of 125 doctors and support team, were also present.

Applauding this rare feat, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that the doctors of AIIMS have demonstrated extraordinary talent, expertise, determination and compassion in achieving it. This is the result of meticulous planning and precision of thinking. “This is the first successful craniopagus conjoined twin separation surgery from India wherein both the children have survived,” he said. He further added that worldwide only 10-15 children have survived after surgical separation of this condition in the last 50 years. This is an extremely rare condition seen in 1 in 25 lakh live births and any kind of surgical intervention in this condition is associated with 75-80% risk of life to one or both children. “All modern adjuncts of technology for surgical planning, 3D print model technology for brain and skull model development, venous bypass, staged surgeries and continuous postoperative care was provided by the craniopagus team of over 75 doctors and 50 nursing /support team staff at AIIMS, Dr Harsh Vardhan said.

The Health Minister stated that it is a subject matter of scientific research to examine that two children from the tribal belt of Odisha were able to withstand such complicated surgery. He added that such a rare case, and the fact that the twins survived the extensive complicated surgery presents an equally rare opportunity to study the various medical and other facets of this unique case and derive valuable learnings for further medical reference and knowledge.

Dr Harsh Vardhan further stated that this case also amply depicts that India is competent to perform such surgeries, and also that poor people from tribal regions from where the twin brother hail from, can also get the best of medical care. A similar surgery in the US in 2016 cost Rs. 2.5 million USD (approx. Rs. 17 crore).

Dr Deepak Gupta, Professor of Neurosurgery made a detailed presentation on the history of the case. Outlining the various stages from the date the twins were admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery (AIIMS, Delhi) on 14th July 2017, he stated that detailed planning for surgical separation was carried out on these conjoined twins totally fused to each other at head level (Craniopagus twins) by a team of 125 doctors and support team led by him. He emphasized on the importance of ‘Planning, Practice and Perform’, along with team work.

The first stage surgery, lasting 25 hours, involved creating a venous bypass on Balia and partial brain separation from Jagga, and was conducted on 28th August 2017. The final separation of the two children was successfully done on 25th October 2017 in an operation which lasted for 20 hrs. Skin grafting and minor neurosurgical procedures were done for the twins to cover skin defects by the plastic surgery team over next few months.

The AIIMS doctors briefed that the Jagga-Balia case was highly complex as they shared venous return (circular sinus) and were totally fused to each other at the head level (Total Vertical type 3 with fused brains in parietal and occipital lobes). They were born in Kandhamal District of Odisha and were kept in SCB medical college, Cuttack for the initial three months after birth. A detailed discussion was held with their family prior to the surgery on the risks associated with the procedure. The doctors informed that while Jagga is developing well in all the domains on neuropsychological assessment and can join special school in Odisha immediately after going to his home state, Balia remains neurologically disabled with profound intellectual impairment. He requires long-term rehabilitation care and needs nurturing and tender loving care as assessed by the neuropsychologists.

A team of three doctors (Dr Deepak Gupta, Neurosurgeon; Dr Girija Rath, Neuroanesthetist; and Dr Kiran Kumar, Pediatrician) along with one nurse from AIIMS, Delhi will accompany the two children on their way back to Odisha by rail today. The two children will be initially kept in SCB Medical College Cuttack for a few weeks for rehabilitation and supportive care. The Odisha government has provided continuous support to these two children right from the time of their admission to AIIMS, New Delhi and continue to do so.

The administration at AIIMS has been proactive in supporting the doctors and other healthcare personnel throughout the treatment of these twins. The administration provided logistic support to the treating team and ensured that the official process was fast-tracked.

                “Eat Right, Stay Fit, Tabhi India Super Fit”, Dr Harsh Vardhan said this as he launched the Eat Right India Movement of FSSAI, the new healthy eating approach which places citizens at the centre of a Health Revolution through food and fitness. The campaign ‘Eat Right India’ with its new logo and tagline ‘Sahi Bhojan. Behtar Jeevan’ were released by the Health Minister, at an event here today on the side-lines of the 5-day ‘72nd Session of the WHO Regional Committee for South-East Asia'.Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), DrPoonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, Ms. Rita Teotia, Chairperson (FSSAI) and Shri Pawan Agarwal, CEO (FSSAI) were also present at the event.

Dr Harsh Vardhan added that this can become a country wide movement only with the active support and partnership of all sections of the society, including the media, the food producers, consumers and other stakeholders. Highlighting the critical importance of a Jan Andolan on issues around nutrition, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that it is part of the vision of the Hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji, that the month of September is being celebrated all across the country as “Poshan Maah” (Nutrition Month) to sensitize the public towards healthy eating, address the twin issues of malnutrition/undernutrition and problem of obesity in some sections of the population, and also intensifying the campaign towards a ‘Malnutrition-Free India’.This movement is aligned with the Government’s flagship public health programmes such as POSHAN Abhiyaan, Ayushman Bharat Yojana and Swachh Bharat Mission to lead us to the New India, which our Prime Minister wishes to deliver to all citizens by 2022.

Dr Harsh Vardhan emphasised that the Eat Right India movement is a crucial trigger for the much needed social and behavioural change. This campaign along with the ‘Fit India' Movement' launched by the visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji will help us to fight lifestyle diseases like hypertension, obesity and diabetes effectively, he added.

“India is passing through an epidemiological shift from communicable to non-communicable diseases, and the burden of diet-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity is rising rapidly. The new “food systems approach” judiciously combines the regulatory and capacity building measures with consumer empowerment initiatives”, he stated. 

Outlining the measures taken by the Government for escalating the Eat Right movement, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that the Government has prescribed a limit for Total Polar Compounds (TPC) at 25% in cooking oil to avoid the harmful effects of reused cooking oil. Standards for five fortified staples -wheat flour, rice, oil, milk and salt to reduce large-scale deficiencies of vitamins and minerals have been notified, in addition to standards for health supplements, nutraceuticals, prebiotics and probiotics products.  “To facilitate informed consumer choices Regulations on Advertising and Claims and mandatory menu labeling has been notified. In addition, labeling provisions have been made for appropriate use of sweeteners for children and pregnant women”,Dr Harsh Vardhan added. He further mentioned that to reach the target of Trans-fat Free India by 2022, regulations to reduce trans-fat to less than 2% in all oils, fats and food products are in place. 

The Union Health Minister said that preparatory work for creating awareness around mindful eating is also in place, with pilots/prototypes for clusterisation schemes such as Clean Street food Hubs, Clean and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable markets and Eat Right Campus for schools, colleges, workplaces and other campuses being successfully tested on a pan-India basis. “Food businesses have participated in large-scale training and capacity building programs on ensuring food safety through the FoSTaC initiative, under which over 1.7 lakh food safety supervisors have been trained and certified.  Robust material in the form of a Pink Book, Yellow Book, DART Book, informative videos etc., are in place, and can be accessed through a video library on FSSAI’s website,” Dr Harsh Vardhan added. The Health Minister further said that he recently inaugurated the first ever state-of-the-art National Food Laboratory of Delhi, NCR and to strengthen the Eat Right Movement a network of food testing laboratories is being established in the country. Today such laboratories have increased to 261 from 138 during the year 2014, he elaborated.

Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO SEARO stated that The Eat Right campaign is a true example of multi-sectoral collaborative approach that WHO has been advocating for to address non-communicable diseases such as heart diseases, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, etc. The campaign brings together people, celebrities and other influencers, food industry, public health professionals, civil society and consumer organizations. It seems to address both the demand and the supply side – by making people aware of the what it means by eating right, and the benefits of it for them to make right choices. On the supply side, it promotes food businesses to reformulate their products, provide better nutritional information to consumers and make investments in healthy food as responsible food businesses. She commended India for launching a campaign mode approach to ‘Eat Right’. This along with the Fit India campaign launched recently will go a long way in addressing non-communicable diseases. What India does and achieves will make a significant impact in arresting the NCD tsunami in the region as well as globally, she stated.

Keeping the Eat Right component intact, the lunch served at the media interaction after the launch event included food with less salt, less sugar and less saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats. The menu had a gamut of dishes made from locally available ingredients, and local produce and combined salads, sprouts, cereals, vegetables etc., that were cooked in minimal mustard and olive oil.

At the event, Dr Harsh Vardhan also launched the new Eat Right India logo that represents a healthy plate, a TVC by the popular cricket icon Shri Virat Kohli on eating right, an online Eat Right Quiz, the Eat Right Online Course for frontline health workers, and an Eat Right India Store featuring merchandize to nudge right eating habits.

                “I am very happy to announce that India will contribute 200,000 US dollars towards implementation of the preparedness stream under the South East Asia Health Emergency Response Fund (SEARHEF), and we will release this support at the earliest.” This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare during the Ministerial Roundtable on Emergency Preparedness on day 2 of the ‘72nd Session of the WHO Regional Committee for South-East Asia,' here today.” The Health Ministers of the South-East Asia Region of WHO also signed the Delhi Declaration on Emergency Preparedness.

Earlier in the morning, Dr Harsh Vardhan, accompanied by Dr Bernard Schwartlander, Chef de Cabinet, WHO and Ms Dechen Wangmo, Minister of Health, Royal Govt. of Bhutan, cycled to the meeting venue to focus on strengthening promotive and preventive health so that people adopt positive and healthy lifestyles. Later, Dr Harsh Vardhan also led the yoga session at the venue where the Health Ministers from eight of the 11 SEARO countries and delegates practiced yoga. The Health Ministers and delegates also went for cycling after the yoga session. He said that the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi ji, gave a call at the United Nations General Assembly to recognize Yoga as a provider of holistic approach to health and well-being. We are happy that the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to observe 21st June as the International day of Yoga, he stated. This, along with Eat Right India campaign, will help us to fight lifestyle diseases like hypertension, obesity and diabetes effectively, he added. He further stated that our visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has recently launched the Fit India Movement and has urged all country people to make fitness part of their daily routine.

Highlighting Cyclone Fani as a case study in early preparedness and disaster management, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that accurate weather prediction, effective early warnings, sturdy preparedness for timely evacuation of nearly 1.15 million people to 6575 cyclone shelters, combined with other risk mitigation measures helped to save many human lives. “Special surveillance was mounted for early detection and control/containment of vector-borne and waterborne diseases. There had been no outbreak of epidemic prone disease following cyclone Fani,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said.

Dr Harsh Vardhan further said that the whole exercise of accurate prediction of cyclone Fani and saving thousands of human lives was appreciated and acknowledged by the United Nations and many other international agencies. Enumerating the emerging challenges, the Union Health Minister said climate change is leading to extreme weather events and sudden onset of natural disasters. The earlier concept of disaster risk mapping is rapidly getting blurred with large sections of hitherto unexposed population getting vulnerable to natural and manmade hazards. This calls for requisite systems strengthening. For a country of this large magnitude, addressing multiplicity of hazards is a critical challenge. Dr Harsh Vardhan also informed that in the recent past, Government of India has provided timely medical supplies to 13 countries requiring humanitarian assistance spread over South East Asia, Asia Pacific and Africa worth 10 million US dollars. We continue to extend medical assistance to six countries this year with medical supplies worth 5 million US dollars, he added.

Speaking about managing rumours during public health emergencies which are amplified through various social media platforms, Dr Harsh Vardhan cited the example of Nipah and underlined the importance of transparency and timely information from government and other authorised sources to allay fears, apprehensions, rumour mongering and anxiety among people. “It is important to share authentic information with the people, as we are the custodians of their faith and as public service providers, need to keep them informed about our support”.

Eight Ministers of Health from 8 of the 11 countries of the WHO South East Asia Region (SEAR), Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region and senior officers of the Health Ministry were also present at the Ministerial Roundtable. This is the second time that India is hosting the Regional Committee meeting; the previous one was also hosted by India in New Delhi.

                “Under the visionary and dynamic leadership of the Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi ji, India has announced a contribution of 22 million US Dollars to the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFTAM) for the 6th replenishment cycle (2020-22), an increase of 10% over the amount contributed by us in the 5th cycle. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare stated that “India stands firm to its long-standing partnership with the Global Fund and its commitment to eliminate AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria”. India’s pledge for the Global Fund strongly demonstratesitsstrong political leadership to achieve the universal health for all and its equallystrong commitment to work across borders to join hands in fighting the epidemics of these three diseases”.

Dr Harsh Vardhan highlighted that India was the first implementing country to host a replenishment milestone of the Global Fund and now has become first among G20, BRICS and implementer countries to announce the pledge for the 6th Replenishment Conference, setting precedent for other donors to contribute generously for the cause.  He said that we are adequately financing our efforts to accomplish our goals of TB, HIV and Malaria elimination and with our increased pledge, India has inched a step closer in this direction by stepping up the Global Fund efforts to strengthen health systems and save 16 million more lives across the globe. 

Partnership between India and Global Fund

India shares a sustained partnership with the Global Fund since 2002 both as recipient and as a donor. Global Fund support with investment of US $ 2.0 billion so far has made significant contribution in attaining targets related to HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria reduction and escalating our fight against these three diseases. In the current funding cycle (2018-21), the Global Fund has allocated US$ 500 million to India. As a donor, India has contributed US$ 46.5 million so far till 2019 including US$ 20 million for the 5th Replenishment.

Stressing on the need for right and healthy nutrition, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that the government is observing the entire month of September as “Poshan Maah” (Nutrition Month) to sensitize the public towards healthy eating, address the twin issues of malnutrition/undernutrition and problem of obesity in some sections of the population, and intensifying the campaign towards a ‘Malnutrition-Free India’. Dr Harsh Vardhan further said that unsafe food and poor diet create a vicious cycle of disease and malnutrition, particularly affecting infants, young children, elderly and sick. “India is passing through an epidemiological shift from communicable to non-communicable diseases, and the burden of diet-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity is rising rapidly. I am happy to share with you that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has adopted a “food systems approach” to ensure our citizens have access to safe and healthy food,” he elaborated. He further said that this approach judiciously combines the regulatory and capacity building measures with consumer empowerment initiatives. Citizens are being sensitized through a people’s movement called ‘Eat Right India’.  “It’s tagline, Sahi Bhojan. Behtar Jeevan’ – ‘Right diet leads to better quality life’ depicts India’s commitment to preventive and promotive healthcare as an important pillar of our health policy, he mentioned.

“I must take this opportunity to thank our Youth Icon, the cricket superstar Virat Kohli, who has helped us to launch a massive campaign. “Eat Right, Stay Fit, Tabhi India Super Fit”, Dr Harsh Vardhan said. He informed that three days ago, Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the 'Fit India' Movement' coinciding with the National Sports day celebrations. This campaign aims at encouraging people to include physical activity and sports as a routine in their everyday life. This, along with Eat Right India campaign, will help us to fight lifestyle diseases like hypertension, obesity and diabetes effectively, he said.

Reiterating the commitment of the government, the Union Health Minister saidthat Ayushman Bharat is India’s road to Universal Health Care. The first component of this is establishing 1,50,000 Health and Wellness Centres by the year 2022, which shall provide an entire gamut of preventivehealthcare. We have already operationalized more than 20,000 Health & Wellness Centres. “The second component, Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana, is aimed at providing health protection cover to over 100 million poor and vulnerable families for secondary and tertiary care including pre- and post-hospitalization expenses. Key features include health cover of up to Rs. Five hundred thousand per family. A total of 17,000 hospitals have been empanelled so far under this scheme. More than 4.1 million persons have become beneficiaries under this scheme and have thus saved a total of an approximate120 billion Indian Rupees on health expenditure,” Dr Harsh Vardhan mentioned in his inaugural ceremony address.

As another component of preventive healthcare, the Union Health Minister further said that “We have charted out a plan to increase full immunization coverage to 90% people through intensification of campaigns under Mission Indradhanush. The range of diseases covered under Universal Immunization Program has also been increased with inclusion of Rotavirus, Pneumococcal and Measles Rubella Vaccines,” he added. Dr Harsh Vardhan further said that ending vaccine preventable diseases remains an important priority of the government.

Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region stated that as governors of health in this region, it also requires that we look beyond our day-to-day concerns and the immediate horizon. She stated, “The flagship priorities have provided targeted focus and been responsible for a series of remarkable achievements. In advancing maternal and child health, tackling measles and rubella, in the battle against NCDs, NTDs, TB and AMR, the Region has performed with skill and determination”. She stressed that updating the Flagship Priorities, which we will do at this Regional Committee, will help ensure continued progress.

                “The CGHS services which started in 1954 from Gol Market in Delhi expanded to only 25 cities till 2014. However, in the last five years under the NDA Government they have been extended to as many as 71 cities. The progress that we have achieved under the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji can be clearly seen. We are aggressively witnessing reforms in every area of the health sector.” This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare at the inauguration of the state-of-the-art CGHS Bhawan, in Sector 13 of R K Puram in New Delhi today in the presence of Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi, Member of Parliament, New Delhi. At the event, Dr Harsh Vardhan also launched the new scheme of Annual Health Check-up of CGHS beneficiaries who are pensioners of the age of 75 years and above. At the event, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that CGHS services should be made available in 100 cities by 2022, when the Prime Minister wishes to deliver a New India to all the citizens. 

The new Bhawan is the CGHS Headquarters and houses the administrative section, the CGHS Card section, and a state-of-the-art modern and well equipped Wellness Centre. 

Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that CGHS services have undergone a remarkable positive change. While the rules have been simplified, several people friendly facilities have also been added.  “The scheme has the potential of becoming one of the best in the world. I wish you to have an internal brainstorming among senior CGHS doctors to evaluate the possibilities of further improvement of the scheme, for strengthening the transparency and adding further reforms”, Dr Harsh Vardhan elaborated.  The Union health Minister assured the CGHS doctors that all positive reforms shall be incorporated in the planning. He also appealed to the CGHS beneficiaries to send their positive suggestions for improvement of the services. In addition, he appreciated the new CGHS initiative of calling telephonically and inquiring about the health of beneficiaries who are above 80 years of age. The Health Minister stressed on the need for compassion and politeness in the behaviour of doctors towards their patients.

At the event, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that reforms in the health sector are one of the priorities of the Government and it has shown exemplary commitment under the Prime Minister to take them forward. The Health Minister added that with the announcement of creation of new AIIMS, the total number of proposed AIIMS has gone up to 22. He also mentioned that the National Medical Commission Act 2019 passed by both Houses of Parliament is historic and path-breaking. It is a huge and visionary reform in the medical education sector by the Government, and will prove to be a milestone in the years to come, he said. “Under Ayushman Bharat, 150000 Health and Wellness Centres are planned to come up by 2022. While the PMJAY scheme is nearing completion of its first year since its launch on 23rd September last year, and several events are being planned across the country to commemorate the occasion”, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated. He also said that since 2014, a total of 157 new Medical Colleges have been approved as part of the scheme for upgrading district/referral hospitals to Medical Colleges. These are in various stages of completion and shall very significantly strengthen the medical education infrastructure in the country, he added.

Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health), Shri  Sanjeeva Kumar, Spl. Secretary (Health), Dr Atul Prakash, Director (CGHS), Dr Sanjay Jain, Addl Director-HQ (CGHS) along with other senior officers from the Ministry and CGHS were present at the event.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah presided over as Chief Guest at the 27th Anniversary celebrations of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) of the Central Reserved Police Force (CRPF), in Ahmedabad today. Shri Shah also presented gallantry medals to the family members of the jawans who have laid their lives in the line of duty.

 



 

Delivering his address on the occasion, the Home Minister paid rich tributes to the officers and jawans who have dedicated their service to build a force to reckon with and be proud of. He especially mentioned the supreme sacrifice made by over 34000 soldiers of Indian police and paramilitary forces to guard the country's borders and maintain internal security. He extended his tributes to the family members of these brave officers and soldiers. Shri Shah added that the mere mention of RAF's name and its presence is enough to prevent riots by dispersing the anti-social elements in the beginning itself. 

 

Shri Shah said that the Narendra Modi government has paid a true tribute to the supreme sacrifice made by these brave hearts by removing the Article 370 and 35A and laying down the foundation of a lasting peace in Kashmir. This step was the need of the hour so as to ensure that there is peace and development in the state and that the blood of our soldiers is not spilt any more. No government could dare for the last 70 years to take a decision that the sacrifices of the soldiers was asking us to take. Shri Shah congratulated the PM for taking such an unprecedented bold decision and assured the people of Kashmir that growth and development would return to them in an environment of peace now. He expressed confidence in the ability of the security forces to give a befitting reply to any attempt to disturb peace in Kashmir.

 



 

Remembering Sardar Patel for his contribution to create a unified India, Shri Shah observed that Indian Police became truly Indian only after Sardar Patel laid down the foundation of the Indian Police Administration in independent India. He said that with the kind of religious, linguistic diversity our country of 130 crore people has, conflicts are natural to arise. Yet, the police and paramilitary forces jawans, without caring for their personal safety and security, have always ensured that the internal security of the country is maintained. 

 

Shri Shah said that the credit of boosting growth and development in the country by maintaining peace goes to the jawans who have made the supreme sacrifice towards this cause. To honour these sacrifices Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has dedicated a National Police Memorial in New Delhi, to the Nation. The PM would release the logo of the memorial on this October 31 (Sardar Patel anniversary), the Home Minister added.

 

Shri Shah appealed to the people of India to not forget the supreme sacrifice the jawans make so that each Indian can live peacefully. He said that every Indian must atleast once visit the National Police Memorial to pay tribute to the jawans who have sacrificed their lives in the service of the Nation. The Home Minister talked about instances from Kashmir, Ladakh, Bhuj and other places across India, where CRPF jawans led from the front and displayed indomitable courage in defending the Nation. 

 

The Home Minister specifically mentioned about the terrorist attack on Parliament, where the CRPF jawans prevented them to enter the Parliament and failed the attack. He also remembered the historic 'Hot Springs Conflict' in Ladakh sector, where the CRPF jawans valiantly defended the Nation from the fierce Chinese attack. ""Every Indian must know that had it not been for these brave soldiers, our beloved Ladakh would not have been with us today. To remember their sacrifices, we celebrate 21st October as 'Police Smriti Diwas' each year"", the Home Minister said.

 

Shri Shah remembered the supreme sacrifice of 2184 CRPF jawans and assured all police and paramilitary force personnel that, ""we would move ahead with determination to transform the country into a 'New India', under the leadership of PM, Shri Narendra Modi"".

 

Talking about the RAF, Shri Shah said that the force has created a huge credibility among the people of India by setting an example through its discipline and courage. He informed that five additional battalions have been added to the existing ten in January 2018. With the initiative taken by Shri Narendra Modi, a training academy has been established in Meerut, which would train police and paramilitary force personnel in anti-riot and crowd-control duties. Many foreign police and armed forces have also trained their officers in this training academy, which is a matter of pride for India, Shri Shah added.

 

The Home Minister noted that whether it is UN missions or rescue operations during natural calamities or awareness campaigns for sanitation, conservation of environment and water or setting up medical camps, RAF has performed brilliantly by establishing a connect with the people at the ground. Shri Shah specifically recognised the contributions of the lady officers of the force and congratulated the 125 lady cadets who took part in the UN peace keeping mission in Liberia. The Home Minister expressed pride that this was the first Indian woman contingent to take part in a UN peace keeping mission. 

 



 

Concluding his address, Shri Shah said with pride and satisfaction that the force has successfully fulfilled the aspirations of the people and accomplished the aim with which it was established.

                Delivering a speech on National Security – Current Perspective, Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah said that Kashmir has been a contentious issue since 1949. He added that there were many misunderstandings regarding the abrogation of Article 370, not just in Kashmiris but in the rest of India as well, and they must be removed.

Speaking of India’s immediate post-independence history, Shri Shah said that amidst the initial struggle for survival, newly freed India had yet another question: that of uniting the 630 disparate princely states into one union. He hailed the role of Sardar Patel in forging a united India as instrumental and praised histireless perseverance towards the task. 

Shri Shah spoke in detail of Jammu and Kashmir’s chequered history and the opposition against Maharaja from 1930s. He added that the state had become a part of the union of India the moment the instrument of accession was signed. He said that the declaration of ceasefire in 1948, just when the Indian army waswinning the war, was a mistake. He added that because of this mistake, while there was no trouble in uniting 630 princely states with India, the complete unification of Jammu and Kashmir with India took August 2019 to fructify.

Shri Shah added that Jammu and Kashmir is a bilateral issue and the UN has no place in it. He noted that the application of Article 370 was a mistake and that neither the people of Jammu and Kashmir nor India had benefited from the same. He called Article 370 harmful for the unity of the nation. He also said that Article 370 had confined the Kashmiri culture to a geographical corner of the country and with its removal, the culture of the state would spread to other parts of the nation.

Hailing Shri Shyama Prasad Mukherjee as the first civilian martyr for the cause of Kashmir, Shri Shah said that Shri Mukherjee always believed that we do not need permission to visit anywhere in our own country.

Shri Shah noted that there was no anti-corruption bureau in Jammu and Kashmir before the removal of Article 370 and in spite of being allotted 2,77,00 crore rupees by the Union Government since independence, the state had not been able to develop because of prevalent corruption.

Shri Shah remarked that every unprecedented reform has teething problems and people must have patience in order to enjoy the fruits of these reforms. Thanking the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Shri Shah said that the people of India are welcoming this momentous decision with open arms.

Shri Shah added that an accurate version of history must be presented to the people, and that a distorted version of history had been presented, because those who had made the mistakes were in charge of writing the history of that time. He said that the dream of a united India had been fulfilled with the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A. He noted that there had been no terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370. Shri Shah also noted that out of 196 police stations, only 8 have section 144 imposed in their respective areas.

Shri Shah said that the benefits of the removal of Article 370 would soon be visible, and that the benefits of various schemes of the central government would now reach the people of Jammu and Kashmir. He also said that infinite possibilities beckon the development of the tourism sector in Jammu and Kashmir.

                Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy, presided over the 15th Formation Day of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in New Delhi today. The theme of this year's Formation Day is ‘Fire Safety’. At this workshop, stakeholders will discuss the fire risk in the country, its prevention and mitigation, key issues and institutional challenges with regards to fire risk reduction, and the way forward. 

 

Commending NDMA for choosing fire risk reduction as the theme, Shri Reddy said that detailed deliberations on fire safety are very relevant in present time and space, as it is a major element of disaster risk reduction. Fire accidents, if not handled carefully, can lead to a huge loss of life and assets, he said. Shri Reddy mentioned about recent fire incidents like the Surat fire tragedy, which have once again emphasized upon the need and importance of enforcing rules and regulations, so as to save precious lives and property. 

 

Shri Reddy observed that in countries like India where fire accidents are one of the biggest risks to business, it is important to take special measures to strengthen the ecosystem for a proactive approach of fire risks prevention, mitigation and preparedness for response. The National Disaster Management Plan unveiled by the National Authority in 2016 and aligned to the Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-30, emphasizes upon fire risks and control measures for fire risk mitigation. The Plan delineates in a matrix format, the role of governments/institutions at Central level as well as at state level in managing fire risks. Shri Reddy emphasized on the need of a coordinated approach to fire risk reduction from all stakeholders at central, state and local levels.

 

Outlining the challenges, Shri Reddy said that enforcement of rules and regulations with regard to fire safety is both a major challenge as well as the prime requirement. He noted that the local authority, in-charge for rule enforcement at state level, must have a clear understanding of the techno-legal regime and profound knowledge of various risk scenarios. Another challenge that he identified was the need for state of art equipments for responding to fire incidents. The Minister said that there is a need for more R&D in this field.

 

Talking about solutions, Shri Reddy stressed upon learning from past incidents and adopting international best practices for fire risk prevention and mitigation. He emphasized equally on capacity building and skill upgradation of government functionaries as well as awareness generation among people about fire risks and precautionary measures through mock drills. Community participation with the government functionaries is a must to prevent fire incidents and minimizing the resultant socio-economic losses, he added.

 

Senior officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs, NDMA, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), Ministries/Departments of the Central Government, State Governments, State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs), Fire and Forest Departments of various States, civil society, and ex-members and Advisory Committee members of NDMA would be participating in the day-long event.

                Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi announced a global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), at the UN Climate Action Summit 2019 held in New York City, USA, on September 23, 2019. 

On the occasion of the announcement of the coalition, witnessed by global leaders, government functionaries, international delegates and diplomats from across the world, Shri Modi stated, “What is needed today is a comprehensive approach that covers everything including education, values to lifestyle and development philosophies. What we need is a global people’s movement to bring about behavioral change; need, not greed is our guiding principal. So, therefore India is here today to present a practical approach and roadmap…In order to make our infrastructure resilient in the face of disasters, India is launching a Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. I invite all member states to join this Coalition.”

The partnership of national governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks, financing mechanisms, private sector, and knowledge institutions will promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks, thereby ensuring sustainable development. 

Developed through consultations with more than 35 countries, CDRI envisions enabling measurable reduction in infrastructure losses from disasters, including extreme climate events. CDRI thus aims to enable the achievement of objectives of expanding universal access to basic services and enabling prosperity as enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals, while also working at the intersection of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Climate Agreement. 

Established as a platform for generating and exchanging knowledge, CDRI will conduct country-specific and global activities. CDRI will provide member countries technical support and capacity development, research and knowledge management, and advocacy and partnerships to facilitate and encourage investment in disaster resilient infrastructure systems. 

In its formative stage, CDRI will focus on developing resilience in ecological infrastructure, social infrastructure with a concerted emphasis on health and education, and economic infrastructure with special attention to transportation, telecommunications, energy, and water. 

Within 2-3 years, the coalition aims to have a 3-fold impact of achieving considerable changes in member countries’ policy frameworks, future infrastructure investments and high reduction in economic losses from climate-related events and natural disasters across sectors. CDRI will uphold the UN Agenda 2030 principle of leaving no one, no place, and no ecosystem behind, focusing on the most vulnerable regions and populations, while enabling inclusive and deliberative processes that recognize national and local efforts as primal. 

An event is also being co-hosted by the Government of India and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) on September 25, 2019 on the sidelines of SDG Summit 2019 to further deliberate on the significance of investing in resilient infrastructure to achieve climate and development goals. This side event will also provide an opportunity to the Government of India and UNDRR to provide an overview and objectives of CDRI, and establish key milestones for its work over the coming years. 

The event is expected to witness address by eminent world leaders and dignitaries, including  Prime Minister of Fiji, Mr. Frank Bainimarama; Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar; Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction, Mami Mizutori; and, Secretary of State for International Development, United Kingdom, Rt Hon Alok Sharma.

Union Minister of Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah graced the National Launch of Private Security Agency Licensing Portal as the Chief Guest in New Delhi today. Also present on the occasion were Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy and Home Secretary, Shri Ajay Kumar Bhalla.

 



 

Addressing the gathering, Shri Shah said that Private Security Agency Sector is of vital importance for the safe and secure business environment and achieve PM's vision of $5 trillion economy by providing employment as well as guarding vital corporations and financial hubs in the country. Shri Shah hailed the private security sector as one with huge potential and stressed on the need to increase trustworthiness of the sector by increasing the number of agencies with licenses.

 

The Home Minister said that the online portal would be useful in ensuring transparency in licensing in this sector and would give a boost to its credibility. He said that with the online availability of credentials, it would become easier for an agency registered in one state to expand its operations in another state. He further assured that the portal will be available in all official Indian languages in next 90 days and said that such facilitation would give a pan-India profile to the online licensing process.

 

Shri Shah observed that as majority of police stations across the country are connected online, the online police verification of security guards would become very easy by accessing the criminal records online from across the country. He appealed to the private security industry to join the government and start awareness campaigns to make people aware in encouraging only license holder agencies in the sector.

 

Shri Shah also said that retired paramilitary and military personnel represent the untapped potential of the sector and agencies should try to recruit people who have undergone at least NCC training. This would ensure basic discipline in the employees. This assumes importance because private security personnel are the first line of responders against criminals in the society. Thus, Shri Shah said, there is a need to impart Indian Penal Code related knowledge to them during their training itself. He added that private security personnel must maintain regular contact with the nearest police station and act as a connector between police and public.

 



 

Shri Shah noted that through proper use of the portal, creative competition in the sector will increase. He said that all states have accepted the portal and are going to be connected to it. He noted that the portal will impart multi-dimensional boost to the sector and should be part of the sector's business expansion strategy. 

 

Shri Shah said that during the ‘26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack’, it was private guards that first confronted the terrorists. It was their prompt action that contained the damage. He said that the universal utilization of private security guards to protect ATMs shows the amount of trust and faith the society puts in the sector. He stressed on the sensitization and welfare of security guards and said that various welfare measures like insurance, pension for security guards must be provided by the agencies under various financial inclusion schemes of the government.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri G. Kishan Reddy said that the Government was committed to good governance under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He added that the portal is an example of Digital India and would bring about transparency and efficiency in the sector. He called it a step towards ensuring ‘Ease of Living’ for citizens. 

 

Shri Reddy noted that some security agencies are still operating without a license and hence a public awareness campaign was needed. He said that only licensed agencies should be allowed to operate and stressed upon the need to educate potential clients like schools, industries and corporate on the importance of hiring only licensed agencies. 

 



 

Shri Reddy lauded the sector as one of the highest employment generators. He appealed to security agencies to ensure the welfare of their security guards. He spoke of the need for a concerted effort by all stakeholders in this direction.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Shah said that a scientific Census process is seminal in the development of not only the social flow in the Nation, but also for laying out the future plan of development for the last man in the society. The Home Minister expressed confidence that the Janganana Bhawan building would get completed well in time and that the mammoth exercise of the Census 2021 would get completed here and the Census figures would be announced to the Nation from this building only. Shri Shah informed that the upcoming Janganana Bhawan would be a Green Building. He added that the concept of Green Buildings needs to be popularised in the country and the Government is taking forward this concept with buildings like the Janganana Bhawan.


Stressing on the importance of people's participation in the Census process, the Home Minister observed that 130 crore Indians need to be made aware about the importance of Census, as it is the foundation for long-term future planning for growth and development in the country. The valuable data generated from the Census exercise is useful for multifarious developmental activities. Each citizen would be able to participate in country's development process only when they are aware of the multidimensionality of the Census process and the data it generates, he added.


Tracing the history of the Census process in India, Shri Shah said that Census is a centuries old tradition in India. Earlier, it used to be a decentralised exercise, happening individually in villages and janpads. He talked about the inception of modern census exercise in British India and how it progressed in successive decades to evolve into an efficiently planned process in recent decades by using latest technology. 


Talking about the use of latest technological developments during the Census 2021 process, Shri Shah said that the process of a 'Pen-Paper Census' would be transformed to a 'Digital Census’ in the upcoming Census exercise by using the latest technology. He informed that this step is a revolutionary initiative that is being taken during the Census 2021 exercise. In this process, people would be able to upload the details of self and family on the newly developed mobile app themselves. Shri Shah emphasized that besides maintaining the data in paper forms, availability of data in digital form would help in its detailed multi-dimensional analysis and utilisation for public welfare, using latest software. Home Minister congratulated the office of Registrar General of India (RGI) for this path breaking initiative.


Shri Shah informed that according to Census 2011 data, India comprises of 2.4% of global land area and resources, whereas houses 17.5% of the global population. These figures tell us how hard India has to work to achieve the required growth and development for its citizens in the times to come, by bridging the imbalance between resources and development needs, he added. The Home Minister expressed satisfaction that 2011 census also brought out good news that literacy rate in India increased to 74% and that India is a 'Young Nation'. 


Shri Shah informed that the 2021 census would be, inter alia, an exercise in the study of human resources, public life, culture and economic infrastructure in the country. It would function as the building block for scientific planning of the future economic development in the country. He added that constituencies would get delimited based on this census data, which would lead to strengthening of the democratic process in India at all levels. It is of great importance that this Census becomes a 'Jan Bhagidari' exercise like never before. 

 




Shri Shah encouraged the officials of RGI and said that everyone present here has an important role in laying the foundation stone of future growth and development of the country. Each one of us has to work whole-heartedly in the direction to make this Census exercise a success. In the times to come, this effort would be your precious contribution in strengthening the economic growth and democratic process in the country, he added.


Shri Shah informed that this is the first time that the National Population Register (NPR) would come into being as the result of the Census exercise. This is a new initiative altogether which would be a solution to multifarious problems facing the country that range from effective maintenance of law and order to efficient implantation of welfare schemes like MGNREGS, food security and nutrition campaigns etc., he added.


Talking about how this government takes a holistic view of the planning process, Shri Shah remembered how prior to 2014, the planning process in India was piecemeal and in disconnected parts. Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi gave a vision of reforming the planning process to evolve it into a scientifically planned and efficiently executed process, keeping in mind the development needs of the last man in the society. From this vision, the process of utilizing the Census data holistically began for the first time in India. 

 

The Home Minister gave the example of how the Census 2011 data was efficiently utilised under the Ujjwala Yojana. The LPG connection beneficiaries were mapped digitally and based on the data analysis, the government got to know about the disparity in the spatial distribution of LPG connections. Subsequently, a well planned LPG connection distribution process was initiated and today 8 crore LPG connections have been distributed in last 5 years and now over 95% of the people have gas connections, he said. Based on 2021 figures, it would be ensured that no one is left without an LPG connection when the Nation celebrates the 75th anniversary of its Independence in 2022, he added. 


Underlying the importance of the Census exercise, Shri Shah emphasized that this exercise must not be taken as a one-time, monotonous exercise. It needs to be remembered that this exercise would lead to development in the Nation for next many decades to come and bring smiles to the people of the country. The Home Minister informed that 22 welfare schemes of the government have been mapped based on these Census figures only. Whether it is providing clean drinking water, road connectivity, electricity, opening bank branches or health and education infrastructure, sanitation or food and civil supply, the basic planning for delivery of public services is based on the Census data. Shri Shah took the example of 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' scheme, wherein the challenging task of saving the girl child and increasing female literacy was accomplished by efficient targeting of awareness campaigns and other welfare schemes across the country. Based on this, he also gave example of Haryana's efficient use of census information to improve its track record regarding child sex ratio. Such accomplishments can only take place when the process of Census is fool-proof and accurate, he added.


Stressing on the importance of Census exercise being complete and holistic, the Home Minister said that this Census would be conducted in major Indian languages and on the mobile app so as to facilitate the people to easily update their details digitally, in their own language. He said that the importance of this vast exercise can be understood from the fact that the Government is going to spend around Rs. 12000 crores during the Census 2021 and developing the NPR, which is the highest ever. He further added that the officers of the RGI who are present here from across the country are responsible to make this digital census exercise a success. Everyone must realise the multi-dimensional uses and benefits of going digital in this exercise. 


Talking about the future potential of an efficient and scientific digital Census process, Shri Shah said that digital census has a great future potential and if efficiently done, it could lead to provision of public services through one platform. He clarified that the government has not taken any decision in this regard.


Calling all officials and people of India to whole-heartedly participate in the Census 2021 process, Shri Shah termed this exercise as a 'RASHTRIYA YAGYA', which requires a cooperative and collaborative effort by all officials and people of the country. It is a process that requires contribution from everyone to make it a success. “It is my firm belief that this bhawan would become the boiling pot of India's economic growth, democratic empowerment of people and removal of poverty from India”, he concluded.

 




Other dignitaries present on the dais included Union Home Secretary, Shri Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Secretary (Border Management), Shri B.R. Sharma and Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, Shri Vivek Joshi, along with other senior officers of the Ministry and of RGI from across the country.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah chaired the29th meeting of the Northern Zonal Council was held at Chandigarh (Haryana)today. The meeting was attended by the Chief Ministers ofRajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Governor of Jammu & Kashmir, Administrator of UT of Chandigarh, Lt. Governor of NCT of Delhi, andvarious Ministers fromthese States and senior officers from the Central and State Governments including Chief Secretaries and Secretaries to Government of India. 

Shri Shah welcomed all the members of the Council to the meeting and hoped that this would be a fruitful meeting where all the issues having Centre-State and inter-State ramifications would be resolved with consensus,after due deliberations.  He stressed that such an approach would strengthen the federal structure of the country.He stated that 20% of the area and 13% of the population is covered by the States in this region and North Zone has made important contribution in the economic growth of the country.  

Shri Shahrequested all the Chief Ministers that in addition to the Zonal Council meetings, regular meetings may also be held among themselves to discuss and resolve issues.  He observed that in the Western Zonal Council meeting recently held in Goa about 90% of the issues were resolved.  

The Council reviewed the progress of implementation of the recommendations made at the last meeting. The Council among others focused on the following issues:


	Speedy investigation of cases of sexual offence/rape against women and children. It was decided that no stone should be left unturned to adhere to the time limits of 2 months for investigation and enquiry/trial in keeping with Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018. 
	The Council expressed satisfaction over release of Rs. 47,436 croresunder CAMPA funds which was long overdue.
	Report of Survey of India relating to boundary disputes between Haryana and Himachal Pradesh was presented,on which there was broad consensus on methodology. 
	It was agreed that coverage of all villages which have hitherto remained without any banking facilities within 5 km radial distance by a Bank/India Post Payments Service must be ensured within 3 months. 


The Union Home Minister also called upon the States to give their suggestions for improvements in Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code. He urged the Chief Ministers to ensure regular monitoring at the Chief Secretary’s level of investigation and prosecution of cases in the courts in case of heinous offences such as Narcotics, POCSO Act, murders etc. For this purpose, the States should fill the post of Director Prosecution without any further delay.  He pointed out that the Government has zero tolerance towards offences under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. There is a need to establish Forensic Science University to ensure accurate investigation and high conviction, Shri Shah said.  

The five Zonal Councils (Northern, Eastern, Northern, Southern and Central Zonal Councils) were set up under the States Reorganization Act, 1956 to foster Inter-State co-operation and co-ordination among the States. The Zonal Councils are mandated to discuss and make recommendations on any matter of common interest in the field of economic and social planning, border disputes, linguistic minorities or inter-State transport etc. They are regional fora of cooperative endeavor for States linked with each other economically, politically and culturally. Being compact high-level bodies, specially meant for looking after the interests of respective Zones, they are capable of focusing attention on specific issues taking into account regional factors, while keeping the national perspective in view.

The deliberations of the Council were warm and cordial, in the true spirit of cooperative federalism and ended with the decision to host the next meeting in Jaipur.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah launched three citizen centric services of the Chandigarh Police, in Chandigarh today. The services include the Emergency Response Support System (ERSS - Dial 112), ‘E-Beat Book’ System and the ‘E-Saathi App’. Shri Shah observed that the beat officer system has been the cornerstone of the Indian Policing system for ages and through suchCitizen Centric Services, a SMART Police force can be built in the country. He congratulated Chandigarh Police to have taken a lead in introducing such Citizen Centric Services in Policing.

ERSS is one of the key projects of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs under Nirbhaya Fund. It has been designed to play a pivotal role in mitigation or preventing escalation of crime, especially against women and children. ERSS provides a single emergency number (112), computer aided dispatch of field resources to the location of distress. Citizens can send their emergency information through call, sms, email and through the 112 India mobile app. 

The ‘Dial 112’ emergency response service is an initiative to strengthen proactive community policing that would end confusion amongst distress callers, who at times end up dialling 100 in fire or medical emergency cases. Till now, there were more than 20 numbers that were running for the help of public for various emergency situations, which were creating confusion to the distress callers.But after starting this service, public will not face these problems. In future, the Emergency Number for Road Accidents (1073),Women Helpline (1091, 181), Child Help Line (1098), including other Helpline services would be added under the 112 unified emergency response number. 

The ‘E-Beat Book’ is a web and mobile based application which will ease the collection, updation and analysis of the information related to crime and criminals in a real time. Chandigarh has been divided in 54 divisions. In each division, there is one ‘Atal Sehbhagita Kendra’that is under the supervision of a Beat Officer,having an Android Phone to the use the app. The E-Beat Book would be linked with Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS), which would help in a real time updation of crime/criminal data. The citizen can directly approach the‘Atal Sehbhagita Kendra’ for redressal of their grievances and can render their suggestions too. 

The ‘E-Saathi’ App would help the general public, including senior citizens, to remain in touch with the police and also give suggestions to facilitate participative community policing(‘Your Police at Your Doorstep’ initiative). The beat officerwould be able to provide services like passport verification, tenant verification, servant verification, character certification etc. at a click of a button through the app, without the people needing to visit the police station.With this initiative, on one hand, where the beat officer would become more efficient in his/her working, this would make police-people communication a two-way process, on the other.

These valuable public services would effectively reduce the response time of police to address the distress calls of the public and strengthen the police-public interface endeavour of community policing.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah presided as Chief Guest over the 5th International Ramayan Festival organized by Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), in New Delhi today.

The Home Minister said that ICCR was established with the vision of propagating Indian culture and its values to the whole world. There is no other better way to realize this vision than organizing the Ramayan festival, he added.

Shri Shah said that International Ramayan Festival is being organized for 5th year in row, during which 17 countries have participated with their artists and rendered their versions of Ramayan. Ramayan is one such scripture that has transcended Personal, Societal, Religious, Cultural and National boundaries and reached a Global audience, he added.

The Home Minister noted that Ramayan is the treasure of centuries old Indian culture and has solutions to all problems in the world. It is an unparalleled creation by Maharishi Valmiki on the life and values of an ideal human being. It beautifully depicts the highs and lows of human life and answers questions on morality and ethics arising out of difficult situations in life.

Shri Shah added that Ramayan goes beyond this and has even explained difficult concepts like good governance, art of war, science and technology, protecting dignity of women, among others, through conversations between the different characters in the scripture.

In the end, Shri Shah congratulated ICCR and its efforts to take Indian culture and its ambassador 'Ramayan', to the whole world. He concluded his address by appealing to all people to imbibe values from Ramayan in their lives and strive to become an ideal human being.

                ""21st Century is India's Century. This is the confidence that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given every citizen of the country in the last 5 years"", said Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah while addressing distinguished members of the industry and management field on the topic of 'New India, Great India', at the 46th National Management Convention held by All India Management Association (AIMA), in New Delhi today.

Shri Shah extended best wishes to the Prime Minister on his birthday and wished that he keeps on leading the Nation from the front for many years to come and make India a global leader. Shri Shah also remembered Sardar Patel for his bold leadership in creating a unified India and said that today is Hyderabad liberation day when the Iron Man of India initiated the Police Action to merge the erstwhile Nizam state into India. 


""What is 'New India'?"", asked the Home Minister while trying to explain PM's vision. He said that it is not an effort to carve out a new country altogether, rather, it is a vision to build a Confident India, a Secure India, a Prosperous and Progressive India, an India which, on the basis of its rich past, can emerge as a widely accepted world leader. This is how the PM sees a ‘New India, a Great India’ of the future, he added. 


For realizing PM's dream, Shri Shah said that it is required that 130 crore Indians move ahead in a coordinated fashion. ""Together we can take 130 crore steps in the direction of realizing PM's vision of a New India. This is the core management principle of achieving a target"", he said. Giving a unified vision, providing a decisive leadership, efficient planning and uniting the people to achieve that vision are the basic constituents of the principle on which this Government has functioned under PM's leadership in the last 5 years, Shri Shah added.


Talking on the achievements during first 5 years of Narendra Modi government, Shri Shah first gave a background of the condition in which the country was, when the new government came to power in 2014. He said that the Founding Fathers of the country envisioned a multi-party Parliamentary democratic system in the country to create a Welfare State and give voice to every citizen of the society in the country. They wanted to create a powerful Nation, with empowered citizens, that can provide leadership in the field of global welfare. This is evident in the debates of the Constituent Assembly also, he said. 


""But after nearly 70 years of independence, there was a question in the minds of the people whether the vision of the founding fathers had really been realized. Whether the multi-party democratic system had failed to fulfill the aspirations of the citizens of the country?"" Shri Shah said that people were absolutely disappointed with the performance of previous governments. In the India of 2013, there was widespread corruption, our borders were not secure and our soldiers were dying every day, there was a total policy paralysis, lack of clear vision of the leadership, the economy was in doldrums, women didn't feel secure and the youth was disappointed. There was a government where every Minister considered himself as the PM, whereas, the PM himself was not considered as PM, he added. 


Shri Shah said that the state of the country was such in 2014 that the common man was clueless as to where the Nation is headed and whether the leadership was actually able to steer the country out of this mess. In this scenario, the Nation gave a resounding majority to Shri Narendra Modi-led government, an absolute majority government for the first time in 30 years. This government worked in an organized manner with clear targets, did detailed analysis of the resources, formed a well laid out implementation strategy and did micro planning on how to correct the wrongs committed by the previous governments. This is how the wheels of development started turning in the country and reached the stage that we see today, he added.

Talking more on how the culture of policy paralysis earlier has transformed into a bold decision making one, Shri Shah said that previous governments could take only 5 decisions in the last 30 years, whereas, Modi government took over 50 decisions in last 5 years. These included implementing GST and insolvency and bankruptcy code, opening Jan Dhan accounts, ending triple talaq, surgical strikes on terrorist camps across the border, one rank one pension, removing Article 370 and 35A, to name a few bold decisions taken by the Modi Government.

Shri Shah said that the people who earlier questioned India's ability to take bold decisions, like in the case of GST, have now appreciated the government's decision-making ability as the revenue generation has crossed Rs. 1 lakh crores and over 95 lakh tax payers have been registered under GST. He said, ""I agree there are many teething problems in the initial phases. Which reform doesn't have teething problems?"" Such problems are being continuously rectified, but it is also true that only those citizens who are ready to bear some initial difficulty, have the right to enjoy the fruits of reforms later. We are a government that doesn't take decision on vote bank considerations, but on what is in the interest of the people, he added. ""Only when we compare the state of the country in 2013 and what it is in 2019, we realize the kind of steps taken by the government and the progress made by the country in the last 5 years"", said Shri Shah while describing the achievements of the government in last 5 years.


Talking on how the Governments in the past have got derailed from their path, Shri Shah said that governments in the past have always been plagued by questions like 'is it a government with backward looking or is it reform oriented; is it a government run by elected representatives or by bureaucrats; is the government with the rich or the poor; what has the government done for the farmers', among others. Shri Shah said with pride that the Modi government is the only government that has gone beyond such questions and has given a governance structure that cares for the last man in the society. This government is a balanced government where the leaders take bold decisions and the bureaucracy implements it seamlessly. The Modi Government has shown in the last 5 years that the Government that thinks for the poor can also bring path-breaking and bold reforms, he added.


Talking about bold decision making on national security front, Shri Shah said that though every Indian feels proud when steps like surgical strikes and air strikes are taken, but it is a fine line that the government has to tread and ensure that nothing goes wrong. He reassured the Nation that Modi government will not compromise even a bit on National Security and only a strong leadership can take such bold decisions. This is amply evident again in the bold decision of removing Article 370 & 35A to realize a truly integrated and unified India, he said.

Shri Shah continued on this point and said that such steps have changed how the world perceives India. Earlier the world used to say that India does not have a National Security policy, India only talks and does not take action to secure its people. People used to say that the surgical strikes were a fluke and a knee jerk reaction. With the Balakot air strikes, a clear message was sent out that India has a well defined policy to defend our borders and not even an iota of aggression towards the country would be tolerated. Post the air strikes, India stance has attained respect globally, he added. 


Speaking on the global leadership role of India, Shri Shah said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s speech in Hindi at World Economic Forum in Davos showed that India is respected by the world. Shri Shah also noted the leadership role of Shri Narendra Modi during the Paris Climate Talks. He said that today the world is standing like a rock behind India in its crusade in ending terrorism and its right to defend its borders. Such a vision of global leadership was seen by our founding fathers, which has been achieved by the Modi Government today. The world is recognizing India's leadership. When the PM gets awarded at global level, it shows the respect those nations and the world have towards India and Indians, Shri Shah added.

Shri Shah said that India was well on way to becoming 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024 and that a strong foundation has been laid in the direction by the Modi Government. He noted that 5 years ago, GDP growth rate was around 6%, but now it is around 7.5%. Speaking on the economic transformation of the nation over the last five years, he said that the National per capita income increased from about Rs. 78,000 to over Rs. 1,26,000; Agricultural Growth rate has picked up pace after the government has increased the budget substantially; National highways construction increased 2.5 times; near total rural electrification has been achieved; 1,20,000 gram panchayats have been linked with broadband; 99.4% citizens have bank accounts today; Health cover was given to 50 crore people under Aayushman Bharat; NDA government built 83 lakh houses in last 5 years, as against 10 lakh houses constructed during 10 years UPA government; 8 crore LPG connections given; houses to 2.5 crore people were given and 8 crore people have access to toilets now. Ease of doing business, global competitiveness, foreign investments, innovation index, among other global benchmarks have seen immense progress in the last 5 years. This shows that there has been efficient, policy-based decision making and implementation by a forward looking government, Shri Shah said.


The Home Minister said that this Government has been focusing on giving the youth a platform to encourage entrepreneurial spirit in the country. He recognized the important role industry and entrepreneurs play in boosting the economic growth of the country. Shri Shah said that India is progressing fast towards becoming a $5 trillion economy and expressed confidence that this target will be achieved by 2024. The industry would have to play an important part in this journey, he said.


Emphasizing on the importance of a stable policy environment in the country, Shri Shah said that 'Rule of Law' is imperative for economic growth and in India becoming a global leader. He added that 'From lawlessness towards the rule of law' is the hologram of this government. He said that it was the responsibility of organizations like AIMA to provide the industry a direction and platform to make India a global trade leader. There is a need to setup sector-based R&D clusters, bring in investments and take 'Make in India', 'Start up India' forward so that India does not need to look towards the world for anything. There is need to ensure that the benefits of intellectual property rights remain in India and India is able to reap the benefits of the rich demographic dividend available in the country. ""India is world's largest market and has the best brains. The government has revamped the business environment in the country. I see no reason why we do not become world leaders in times to come"", he added.


Shri Shah assured full government support to industry associations and asked them to bring innovative ideas and take forward the push that the government is giving for industrial and trade growth. There is a need to prepare our industries to face global competition amidst changing times and challenges. By 2022, the 75th year of India's Independence, 130 crore Indians need to rise and realize PM's vision of a 'New India, Great India', he concluded.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah graced the Hindi Divas Samaroh 2019 as Chief Guest today at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. Also present on the dais were Ministers of State for Home Affairs Shri Nityanand Rai and Shri G Kishan Reddy, as well as Secretary and Joint Secretary, Department of Official Language.

 

Shri Shah said that while unity in diversity is India's defining trait, a common language is needed as a culturally unifying factor. Shri Shah remarked that even Gandhi ji and Sardar Patel, who forged a united India, appealed to people to accept Hindi as the national language. Shri Shah lauded the work done by the Department of Official Language in popularizing Hindi, and appealed to citizens to work towards making Hindi the most widely used language in the world. Shri Shah also emphasized Hindi as a factor that unites India. 

 

Shri Shah appealed to all to get connected with Hindi. He noted the unanimous consensus for Hindi as national language in the Constituent Assembly, in spite of the Assembly's sheer diversity. He said that this decision was an important factor in ensuring cultural unity of India. Noting on the linguistic richness of India, he said that the nation was home to 122 languages and more than 19500 dialects. 

 

Shri Shah said that a country that forgets its language kills its cultural existence. Language connects us to the roots of the nation. Addressing the youth of India, Shri Shah called for introspection and said that if we lose our language, we will be cut off from our culture. He asserted that the richest languages of the world belong to India. The depth of Indian languages is unparalleled, because of the equally unparalleled depth of Indian culture.  

 

Shri Shah said that we must leave the inferiority complex towards Hindi and our other languages that has set in due to colonial hangover. He called for greater use of the national language in all aspects of life. He said that only when we understand the importance of Hindi, can it thrive and prosper. He said that we must be proud of our language. Noting the role played by teachers in the growth of languages, he said that teachers and educators must instil a sense of pride about Hindi in students. 

 

Shri Shah said that while diversity in languages is the strength of our nation, a national language needed so that foreign languages and cultures do not overpower our own. He proclaimed that next year, the Hindi Divas Samaroh would be a public program, as Hindi belongs to the people. He said that the Government would take Hindi Divas outside Delhi, and would celebrate a Hindi Saptah across the country. He called Hindi the heart and soul of the freedom struggle. 

 

Shri Shah noted Vinoba Bhave's love for Hindi and Gandhi ji's assertion that a nation is mute without its national language. He said that our power to express our culture will die in the absence of our national language. Quoting Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya, Shri Shah said that without Hindi, democracy is not possible in India. The language of the state should be that which people can understand. He remembered Purushottamdas Tandon, who proclaimed national language to be the lifeblood of a nation. 

 

Shri Shah remembered former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the first Minister of External Affairs to give a speech in Hindi at the United Nations in 1977. He hailed this as a seminal step to break the inferiority complex of Indians with respect to Hindi. He also hailed former Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj's contribution to the global growth of Hindi, who encouraged the UN to use more Hindi, including on Social Media. This eventually led to the Hindi Twitter account of the UN. 

 

Praising the Prime Minister's commitment to Hindi, he noted that  wherever the Prime Minister addressed expatriates, he spoke in Hindi. Shri Shah noted that the Prime Minister addressed even the  UN General Assembly and the World Economic Forum in Davos in Hindi, making him the first head of government to address WEF in a national language other than English.  

 

Shri Shah called upon institutions and individuals to be committed to the growth and use of Hindi. He spoke of the need to proliferate Hindi in technical fields like medicine, engineering and law. He expressed confidence that Hindi would have reached ever greater heights by 2024 elections. He asserted that the growth of Hindi will never be at the cost of any other language and added that Hindi is the language of coexistence. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State Shri G Kishan Reddy said that while Telugu was his mother tongue, he had equal love for Hindi. He said that a mother tongue and national language must go together. He noted that the Constituent Assembly accepted Hindi as a national language, as it had been the unifying thread between cultures,  religions and regions during the freedom struggle. He called Hindi a source of self-pride for the country. He noted the famous Tamil poet Subramania Bharathi's love for Hindi. He added that Hindi is India's greatest social and cultural heritage and is emerging as a powerful cultural capital of India. He remarked that even multinational firms were accepting Hindi as a functional language. He noted the growing popularity of Hindi with India's films, and said that the growth of Hindi on the global stage adds to India's soft power. He advocated a greater use of IT for the development and popularization of Hindi. 

 

Minister of State Shri Nityanand Rai said that languages are the souls of societies and nations. People express themselves in their languages. He added that Hindi consists of our emotions and aspirations, and acts as a connecting language for the whole of India. He called Hindi the symbol of India's democratic system and said that our nation's identity depends on the strength and popularity of our national language. He noted that the Constitution has given us the responsibility of the growth and development of Hindi and called for greater use of Hindi in the official work of Union Government and that of various regional languages in the official work of State Governments. He said that Antyodaya is our goal, and Hindi plays a vital role in achieving that goal, as it is the commonest language of communication across the nation.  

 

Shri Shah launched the E-Saral Hindi Vakya Kosh and E-Maha Shabda Kosh Mobile App, both initiatives of the Department of Official Language that aim to harness information technology for the growth of Hindi. He awarded Rajbhasha Gaurav Puraskar and Rajbhasha Kirti Puraskar to government departments and public sector units respectively for their contribution to Hindi.

                The Bureau of Police Research and Development is organizing a two-day National Conference on ‘Criminal Activities and Radicalization in Jails: Vulnerability of Inmates and Jail Staff and their Protection’ on 12th and 13th September. The conference was inaugurated earlier today at BPR&D Headquarters by Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy. He delivered the keynote address in the presence of senior serving and retired officers of MHA, CAPF, State Police, academia, civil society organizations, prison officers along with BPR&D officers and staff.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Reddy enumerated various challenges in the field of correctional services and the need for a conscious policy to improve prison systems and associated human resources. He further mentioned that prison administration in the country since independence has been a matter of intense debate on various forums. Even the Supreme Court of India has expressed its concern over the conditions of prisons. Therefore, there is a need to ensure safety and security of the prisoners, improve the condition of living of prisoners and to convert the prison as a centre of reformation.

The Minister emphasized that prison system should not be allowed to aggravate sufferings during the process of imprisonment. He focused on the need to reform convicts and rehabilitate them back into the society. He also listed various challenges associated with prison reforms such as overcrowding in prisons, large number of under-trials, inadequate prison infrastructure, criminal activities and radicalization in jails, safety of women prisoners and their young children, along with shortage of funds and staff for proper prison administration. 

Shri Reddy mentioned various steps taken by the Central Government over the last ten years to improve the conditions of prisons, such as fast track courts and Lok Adalats, both of which would reduce pendency and the number of under-trials, thus reducing the burden on the prison system. He mentioned the Scheme for Modernization of Prisons – a Central Government scheme with an outlay of 1800 crore rupees that aims to create 199 new jails, 1572 additional barracks and 8568 prison staff quarters.

Shri Reddy spoke of the immense scope for NGOs and civil society organizations in the aftercare and rehabilitation of convicts, and said that civil society participation in the field should be encouraged. He emphasized that public participation in correctional services is critical for strengthening the efforts towards reformation of prisoners

Also present on the dais were Shri V. S. K. Kaumudi, DG, BPR&D and other senior officers.

Everest.  

On 30th September, 2019 at about 0845 hrs the CISF expedition team successfully summited Mount Satopanth peak.  This was the maiden Mountaineering expedition by CISF and a new record has been created of being the first CAPF whose expedition team comprising of three (03) women personnel have achieved this feat. The main objective of this expedition was to spread the message of empowering women through mountaineering, to keep spirit of adventure alive in force and to inculcate the taste of adventure amongst officers, men and women personnel in the force.

During the expedition, the team pushed their limit and achieved their goal by exposing themselves to the highest order of mental and physical challenges, which included exposures to low atmospheric pressure, thin air, sub-zero temperatures, incessant snow blizzards and many other harsh climatic conditions. 

Shri  Rajesh  Ranjan  DG, CISF,  Dr. Mangu Singh  MD, DMRC,  and other Senior Officers of CISF were present during the ceremony.

                Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah today addressed the opening session of the 68th Plenary of the North Eastern Council in Guwahati today. Shri Shah began his address by paying tribute to Bharat Ratna Late Bhupen Hazarika. He said that this day also assumes importance for the fact that today is also the Birth Anniversary of the late Bhupen Hazarika who introduced to the world the entire Northeast through his art and music. He added that Bhupen Hazarika got ample opportunities to get himself settled in other parts of the country and even outside the country as he was a legend who expressed himself through music and songs in different languages. But he never left Northeast as he was of the view that if he will leave his native place the rich heritage, culture and unique tradition of the Northeast will fail to get a platform to be showcased before the entire world, he added. He added that throughout his life he remained as the ambassador of the culture of the Northeast, and that the present Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, as a respect for his contribution for the enrichment of the rich culture of the region, conferred him with Bharat Ratna.

Shri Shah referred to the PM’s remark where he said that Northeast can be the new engine for India’s Growth and the contribution from this region towards the progress and development of the country should be the highest among other states. Northeast is a mini India in itself which consist of the mighty Himalaya range in one hand and on the other hand there is the most beautiful landscapes of the world - Barak, Brahmaputra and Imphal valley. Hinting on the immense potential of the region, Shri Shah said that Northeast comprises of around 9 percent of the total area of the country with a population of around 5 crore which comprises of 3.78 percent of the total population. The region also bears strategic importance for the fact that it shares International border for around 5300 km. referring to the diverse culture of the Northeast region, Shri Shah said that there are around 270 ethnic group and around 150 dialects in the region and all development activities and initiative should be directed towards preserving and enriching the rich heritage of this region. He said that the identity of India was never geo-political rather it was geo-cultural and if this principle is accepted by all India and Northeast will be never be treated separate. He said the cultural and linguistic identity of the North East Region should be preserved and maintained even as fast development is taking place under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi.

Quoting substantially from the Mahabharata, the Home Minister said North East and rest of  India are connected since mythological era and this will never be separated under the able leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. North East Region will develop, prosper and become a pride of India, Shri Shah asserted. He also said that the growth of Northeast during the last 5 years is much more in comparison to that of the 70 years after independence. The development process which was started in 2014 will be expected to be accomplished in 2022. Shri Shah said the 8 North Eastern states are like Astalakhmi and they will play a vital role in the development of the country.

Shri Shah announced that the North East Council will earmark 30 per cent of its fund for focussed funding of priority areas and deprived sections of society in the North East. Shri Shah said that every state will identify those villages or regions which are backward in various indicators and will work to bring those regions at par with the rest of the country. The growth story shall never be complete until the entire state progresses at par with the other part, he added.

The Minister said that the North Eastern Council have been the nodal agency since 1971 for planning and implementation towards economic and social development of the North Eastern Region and in 2022 NEC will be completing 50 years while India will be completing 75 years of its independence. He added that it is the time NEC should work on preparing the road map to ascertain the progress that Northeast will achieve by 2022. He opined that today we should set the targets to ascertain the law and order situation in Northeast by 2022 and to set the targets for enriching the culture, tradition and language of the Northeast. He said that that Northeast, as a region prior to the Independence, was the greatest contributor of GDP for the Nation and today we all should manifest our efforts and set targets to bring back those days. He also said that NEC should focus on afforestation, development of organic farming, measures to revive lost languages and measures to resolve inter-state disputes between North Eastern states.

Speaking on the Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement, Shri Shah said that the landmark decision will enable the re-establishment of link between Kolkata and Dhaka Ports. Prior to independence these ports served as the gateway for trade and commerce of the Northeast region. With the opening of the trade through this route, considering the huge natural resources of the Northeast, this region can once again become the leading contributor of GDP for the country. He said that the present government has also set up targets to bring all the eight states in the railways and air map of the country by 2022.

Shri Shah said that after abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, there was some misinformation that there will be also changes to Article 371. He however asserted that the Centre respects Article 371 and it will not touch the Article which grants special provisions to the North East.

He explained the difference between Article 370 which was temporary in nature and Article 371 which is about special provisions in the North East. “I have clarified in Parliament that this is not going to happen and I am saying it again today in Assam in presence of the eight Chief Minister”, Shah added.

Commenting on the commitment of the Central Government for the development of the Northeastern region, Shri Shah said that there has been a 1.5  time increase of budget of NEC from 13th Finance Commission to 14th Finance Commission from Rs 3376 crore to Rs 5053 crore. Enumerating the various development schemes directed towards the progress of the region Shri Shah listed some of the schemes and said that from the projected 558 projects 352 projects have been completed, construction of 997 km roads have been completed, 2480 km transmission lines have been completed, APJ Abdul Kamal Centre for Policy and Research has been set up, Bogibeel Bridge has been completed and Rs 1400 crore under the North East Road Sector Development scheme under DoNER has been sanctioned.

Speaking on the recent publication of NRC in Assam, Shri Shah expressed his satisfaction over the timely completion of the process and also added that the government will not allow a single illegal immigrant to stay back in the country.

Shri Shah said that the Northeast is progressing steadily on the road to development under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi as a result of which Northeast which was identified with  negative labels such as bandhs, blockades, extremism, arm trafficking and corruption is now known for infrastructure development, organic farming, sports, connectivity and Act East Policy.

Shri Shah concluded his address with an appeal to all the states to invest more on Bamboo Mission and added that if it is developed to its full potential it can restrict 1 lakh crore imports.

Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region and Minister of State for Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh while acknowledged the uniqueness of the Northeastern region, Dr Singh said that as far as the region is concerned there is much more to learn from Northeast for rest of India than Northeast has to learn from the rest of the country. In the last five years Northeast has come more into focus and that has been possible because the government is actually moving in that direction. He said that under the direction of the Prime Minister in every fortnight one Minister will be visiting a state of the Northeast to listen to people and ensure the region is developed in every sphere. Reiterating the commitment of the Government for the development of the Northeast, Dr Singh said that North East Council has been given its highest budgetary allotment of 1476 crore rupees for the year 2019-20.

Dr Singh said that one of the major achievements of the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during the last five years has been that the students from Northeast have been provided the facility for cost-effective living through hostels and other means in different parts of the country. He informed that a Northeast Hostel for Girl Students has been completed within the campus of Bangalore University. Similarly, he said, an exclusive Northeast Hostel is under construction within the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where a very large number of youth are pursuing higher studies. A similar will come up at Rohini for Northeast students studying in Delhi University, he added.

Complementing the youth from North Eastern region for their diligence and aspirational focus, Dr Singh said, the “Start-up India, Stand-up India” programme initiated by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been implemented in the North Eastern region, with an added incentive from the Ministry of DoNER in the form of “Venture Fund” to be provided to any young entrepreneur or Start-Up who wishes to pursue it in the region. The response to this, he said, has been very encouraging and in the years to come, Northeast may become a favourite destination for young Start-Ups from all over India.

For the youths of the Northeast, the minister added that they are at the one of the best times in the journey of India. Every youngster from across India will come forward to Northeast as his destination and that it is for people living in the Northeast to rise upto that occasion and to cultivate the capacity of being able to make the best use of these new opening of vistas of development that is happening rapidly, he added.

The NEC Plenary meeting is being attended by Governors, Chief Ministers, MPs of the Northeast and senior officers of the eight North-Eastern states and Union Ministry of DoNER.

                Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy presided over as Chief Guest at the flagging off of a cycle rally, jointly organized and participated by various CAPFs including BSF, CRPF, CISF, SSB, Assam Rifles, ITBP, NSG. This rally is being organized as part of celebrations to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi's 150th anniversary year of birth, in Porbandar today. 500 cyclists would be paddling from Porbandar to New Delhi, with the theme - Non-Violence, Swachchata and Say ‘No to Drugs’.

Talking about the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, Shri Reddy said that Gandhiji is a symbol of truth and non-violence for the whole world. His vision of an egalitarian, inclusive, sustainable  and peaceful society are most relevant even today, as the world is facing problems like global terrorism, fanaticism, extremism, among others. The Father of the Nation taught the world how biggest of problems facing mankind may be resolved through his message of peace and non-violence, the Minister added.

Shri Reddy said that the Government is celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary in a big way and, through various programmes, his vision and values would be taken amongst the people. He remembered Bapu’s message of ‘sanitation and cleanliness being more important than Independence’. In this context, the Minister highlighted Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Swachch Bharat’ and his clarion call to the Nation to make India Plastic Free from 2nd October, 2019. He also talked about the ‘Swachhata hi Sewa’ programme, to be launched from 11th September, 2019, as a part of the celebrations. 

Shri Reddy praised the paramilitary forces for their indomitable spirit and dedication to the service of the Nation. “Our soldiers on the borders fight every day to protect and safeguard the sovereignty and integrity of our country. I want to assure all the people gathered here and the families of the Central Armed Police Forces that the entire country stands firmly with the jawans and honors the sufferings and sacrifices they are making”, he said.

Talking about the cycle rally, Shri Reddy said that this effort would surely play a vital role in building a positive and harmonious image of the security forces in the public. It will also provide an opportunity to spread the message and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi, including that of a ‘Clean India’, to the general public and pay tribute to national unity and integrity. It would encourage people to tread the path shown by Gandhiji and will help in building a better future of the Nation in the coming days, the Minister concluded.

                The third round of talks with Pakistan on the modalities for operationalisation of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor are held today at Attari, Amritsar. Indian delegation comprised of representatives from the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Government of Punjab, Land Ports Authority of India, National Highways Authority of India, in addition to Ministry of Home Affairs.

. The meeting reviewed the progress reached in the two rounds of Joint Secretary Level meetings and four rounds of Technical Level meetings, held earlier.

The first round of discussions at Joint Secretary Level was held on 14th March 2019 at Attari, India, followed by the second round of discussions on 14th July 2019 at Wagah, Pakistan. As a follow up to these discussions, four rounds of technical-level meetings were also held where both sides discussed the issues related to alignment of the road and infrastructure for the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, temporary service road pending the bridge to be built by Pakistan, modality and format for sharing details regarding pilgrims and evacuation procedures in case of emergencies.

. The following understanding has been reached by both the Parties at today’s meeting:


	Agreement on visa free travel of Indian pilgrims, without any restrictions based on their faith. Persons of Indian origin holding OCI card too can visit Holy Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib using the Corridor.
	5,000 pilgrims can visit Holy Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib using the Corridor every day. Additional pilgrims, over and above the figure of 5,000, can visit on special occasions, subject to capacity expansion by Pakistan side. Pakistan has conveyed its assurance to increase this number.
	The Corridor will be operational throughout the year, seven days a week. Pilgrims will have a choice to visit as individuals or in groups, and on foot.
	Both sides agreed to build the bridge at Budhi Ravi Channel. Pending the construction of the bridge on Pakistan side, both sides agreed to the crossing point coordinates of the temporary service road being built.
	The Pakistan side has agreed to make sufficient provision for preparation and distribution of ‘Langar’ and ‘Prasad’ for the pilgrims.


However, owing to inflexibility shown by Pakistan, the agreement could not be finalised today. Pakistan has insisted on charging a service fee for allowing Pilgrims to visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib, which is repugnant to the spirit of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor. Pakistan has also shown its unwillingness to allow the presence of Protocol officials at the Gurdwara premises to accompany the pilgrims for their facilitation. Pakistan side was strongly urged to reconsider its position.

Further, despite India’s persistent request to allow additional ten thousand (10,000) pilgrims on special occasions such as Gurpurab and Baisakhi, Pakistan side has highlighted infrastructural constraints on their side and conveyed that they may be able to step up subject to the availability of capacity.

India has also underscored the importance of ensuring safe and secure environment for the pilgrims. In this context, Indian side shared concerns regarding individuals or organisations based in Pakistan who may try to disrupt the pilgrimage and misuse the opportunity to play with the sentiments of the pilgrims. In the last meeting held at Wagah, Pakistan, a detailed dossier was handed over to Pakistan to highlight Indian concerns in the matter. 

Significant progress has been achieved in setting up a  state-of-the-art infrastructure, including passenger terminal on the Indian side that can handle over 15000 pilgrims in a day. This is targeted to be completed by 31st October, 2019. The work on the 4-lane highway to the crossing point at the International Boundary is progressing satisfactorily and is on schedule. It will be completed by end of September 2019. Further, a robust security architecture is being put in place. All the facilities on Indian side would be ready to commence the pilgrimage through Kartarpur Sahib Corridor on the auspicious occasion of the 550th Birth Anniversary of Sri Guru Nanak Devji.

                Invoking the recent amendments in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, the Central Government has decided to declare the following individuals as terrorists and add their names to Schedule 4 of the Act:


	Maulana Masood Azhar : chief, founder and key leader of Jaish-e-Mohammad
	Hafiz Muhammad: chief, founder and key leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba/Jamat-ud-Dawa
	Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi: chief operation commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba and one of its founder members
	Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar: runs an international underworld crime syndicate and is involved in perpetrating acts of terror


All of the above are involved in terrorist attacks in India, and have been designated as global terrorists under United Nations.

Earlier when terrorist organizations were banned, the individuals associated with it simply changed names and continued to carry out terrorist activities.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah met three different groups of representatives from Jammu and Kashmir today. 

This was his first meeting with the representatives of sarpanches from various districts of Jammu and Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370. He also met representatives of fruit growers, agricultural markets and some members of local horticulture associations. He also met the representatives of the community of people displaced in the partition. All three delegations congratulated the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and the Union Home Minister for the courageous step of abolishing article 370 and 35A. 

Shri Shah informed the delegation of sarpanches that henceforth the provisions of the 73rd and 74th  Constitutional Amendment Acts would be applicable to Jammu and Kashmir and this would serve to empower local governance and panchayati Raj institutions in Jammu and Kashmir. 

On the issue of mobile connectivity and restoration of communications, the Union Home minister said that the issue would be expedited and that a solution would be found as quickly as possible. Greeting the sarpanches, Shri Shah hailed them as the leaders of Jammu and Kashmir and said that it would be their responsibility to ensure that the benefits of various government schemes would reach the correct beneficiaries and that an atmosphere of peace and prosperity is maintained. Shri Shah promised to begin recruitment for various government jobs at the earliest and said that the government would ensure merit-based recruitment of at least five aspirants from each village. 

The representatives of fruit growers expressed their concern regarding the possibility of unsold and wasted produce. Shri Shah reassured them by saying that the government is in touch with concerned agencies to resolve the issue. He noted that with the abrogation of Article 370, the benefits of various government schemes like PM Fasal Bima Yojana would reach all farmers of Jammu and Kashmir now. 

Shri Shah clarified that the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir would be restored as soon as the situation warrants, and asked the representatives to not believe any rumours. Shri Shah reassured the representatives that nobody's land would be taken away and government land would be used for the establishment of industries, hospitals and educational institutions. This would not only create employment opportunities for the locals but also enhance tax revenues for the state, which in turn would be used for the welfare of the people.

Shri Shah said that it was essential to change the atmosphere and bring the people of Jammu and Kashmir to mainstream. Shri Shah promised to begin the process of Block level elections as quickly as possible. He told the representatives that your fight is against terrorism, as is ours, hence we should ensure an atmosphere of peace in Jammu and Kashmir at the earliest. 

Shri Shah met the representatives of the displaced people who had initially registered in various stages of India but later settled in Jammu and Kashmir. Shri Shah assured them that they are being considered for inclusion in the scheme under which displaced families registered in Jammu and Kashmir are given financial assistance.

                Addressing an event in Solapur, Maharashtra today, Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah said that by taking the bold step of abrogating Article 370, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given a strong message that the Unity and Integrity of the Nation comes above everything else. On the issue of Article 370, people of India are standing like a rock with the Prime Minister, he said.

 

Shri Shah said Sardar Patel integrated 630 princely states but was not allowed to integrate Jammu & Kashmir into India. This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has realized this dream of the Sardar and that of the people of India for the last 70 years. Jammu Kashmir is an integral part of India and doors of development have now been opened for the people. Now no enemy can dare to attempt any misadventure against the security and integrity of India, he added.

 

The Home Minister said that those in the opposition have opposed this step tooth and nail and have questioned the abrogation of Article 370. They must clarify whether they want terrorism to continue and bloodshed to go on in the country. Their statements are being used by our enemies against India in the UN, he said. 

 

Speaking further on how normalcy is being restored in Jammu Kashmir, Shri Shah said that since August 5 there has not been a single bullet fired in the state and not a single life has been lost. He said, ""I appeal to all political parties to rise above politics, not think about vote bank and stand with the government to secure the unity and integrity of the country. There are many other issues on which politics can be done but it must not happen on issues of national security and integrity of the Nation"".

 

The Home Minister remembered how Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee supported Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Government in 1965 and Smt. Indira Gandhi led government during 1971 Indo-Pak wars, on the floor of the Parliament. When in 1994, Pakistan brought up the Kashmir issue again, the P.V. Narasimha Rao Government brought a resolution in the Parliament, which was supported by our party in both Houses. The question came up as to who would present India's case strongly in the UN, Shri Rao said that no one other than Shri Vajpayee can do this. Shri Vajpayee, though being in the opposition, led the Indian delegation to UN and presented India's stand in front of the world strongly. He used to say, “We live not for politics but for India”. 

 

Appealing to the opposition to stand united with the Government on issues concerning National Security, Shri Shah reiterated, ""We have always supported the government on all the issues where the country is concerned. I expect the same from the opposition as well"".

 

The Home Minister praised the Shri Devendra Fadnavis led Maharashtra government and said that earlier the government used to worry about only one family but the present central and state government are worrying about the public, hence Maharashtra is moving forward. He said that in our culture, when people give us a mandate, we give account of each penny spent. Shri Shah said that the central government increased the funds to Maharashtra from Rs. 1,15,000 crore to Rs. 2,86,354 crore, which gave a boost to the development works. He said that earlier it was said that out of 100 paise sent by Centre 85 paise were lost on the way, but now to the 100 paisa sent from the centre, the state government is adding its share and giving benefits worth 125 paise to the public.

                The functioning of CPWD is expected to improve substantially consequent to implementation of revised organizational structure. Government has decided to implement ERP in CPWD so as to radically transform its functioning and to propel it on a high growth path by improved transparency & accountability, faster and effective decision making, improved Client interfaces & satisfaction and to unlock its latent productivity and efficiency. 

             

New condensed result centric CPWD Works Manual has already been brought out and restructuring of the Department has also been implemented. Revised Organizational Structure has enhanced the efficiency, effectiveness, quality, better client services, accountability and long term success of the organization by ensuring optimal utilization of the human resource. With the implementation of the revised structure, functional needs of the organization have become harmonized to cater to the ever increasing work load and requirements of the Clients. 

 

By way of delayering, earlier seven levels of functioning from Junior Engineer to Director General, which caused slower decision making and distributed accountability leading to delays and impacting quality have been reduced to four levels, thereby decision making has become faster, passing the buck tendency has eliminated, accountability and sense of belonging / ownership at every level have increased. There is no inter-reporting between SDG and ADG, SE and CE, JE and AE in the revised system of functioning. SDGs and ADGs heading the project regions and field regions have become directly accountable to the Director General, CPWD. These senior level posts have now become fully active and functional. With the separate vertical created for execution of major projects through empowered project units under SDGs/ADGs, now focused and exclusive attention is being given by SDGs/ ADGs for speedy execution of the Projects with quality and economy. CEs and SEs now having compact setup under them, they are able to provide better qualitative input, support and guidance to their units resulting quantum increase in output of the field units. With lowering of unified command of Electrical & Mechanical and Civil streams to SE level, the functioning have become more cohesive and one pointed. Clients are getting single window service now at SE level. 

 

The Department is functioning as one fabric and inter-cadre differences have eliminated. With the alignment of Architecture and Horticulture cadres with main stream execution set up in the reorganization setup, these cadres have become more effective, productive and delivery oriented. Ineffective planning posts have been utilized for direct execution of works. It will increase turnover of the Department and also ensure functioning of the Department in single file system. For optimal utilization of the human resource, work centers were identified, posts allocated to these work centers and persons from metros shifted at these works centers, which resulted in faster output of the works and enhanced satisfaction of the clients. Regional Design Centers created at Regional HQs are efficiently catering to the design needs of the region locally at one place. This will reduce the delays in execution of works. 

 

CPWD Regional Training Institutes located across the country have been integrated, unified and upgraded, which facilitated improved performance of the Training activities of the Department. With the strengthening of setup at HQ, formulation of policies and guidelines and other HQ activities for growth and development of the Department have witnessed a substantial boost. Restructuring has been implemented without reduction in the strength of any of the cadre of the Department and by catering to the needs of entire geographical spread and works requirement of the Department.

                            It has been decided to include all areas, which are notified Planning/ Special Area Development Authority/ Urban Development Authority or any such Authority under State/Central legislations, which is entrusted with the functions of urban planning, regulations and development function akin to Statutory Urban local Bodies for all purposes including sanitation, in Swachh Survekshan - 2020. Example for such bodies could be Industrial Estate Townships like Noida, Greater Noida, Jamshedpur or Bokaro Steel City, Port Area Development Authority, SADA for specific purpose etc. Only such Urban Development Authority will be included in the category where there is no statutory urban local body e.g. Amravati Development Authority. A separate category of such cities has been created for evaluation under Swachh Survekshan-2020.

            The parameters for evaluation of these townships which do not have statutory urban local body will remain the same as applicable to ULBs or Cantonment Boards with some modifications. A separate National Workshop for these Urban Townships will be organized in the second week of October to explain the methodology of Swachh Survekshan - 2020 for this category.

            The Government has directed all  concerned authorities of such Townships to sensitize them about their coverage in Swachh Survekshan – 2020 and to appoint a Nodal Officer for each such Township for this purpose. 

            Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Urban with the goal to make the country clean and open defecation free. To monitor the progress of this mission, Swachh Survekshan - an annual cleanliness survey was initiated in 2016 for evaluating 73 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and it has now been scaled up to all 4,378 ULBs and all Cantonment Boards oflndia. The Swachh Survekshan has proved to be an effective monitoring and governance tool in ascertaining the progress made by the cities towards cleanliness and citizen engagement.

Energy-efficient engineering and construction technologies need to be at the core of reformulated building regulations and construction practices”, he added.  The Minister was speaking at a National Seminar on ‘Emerging Trends in Public Architecture’ organised by Central Public Works Department(CPWD) here today.  Shri DurgaShanker Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, Shri Prabhakar Singh, DG, CPWD, architects, urban planners and senior officials of the Ministry also participated in the Seminar.

Addressing those present, the Housing Minister stated that as India urbanizes further, there will be an exponential increase in the volume and complexity of waste, including hazardous e-waste, and quite extraordinary demands for energy, which cannot possibly be met through current fossil-fuel resources. If we are to cater to our future in such a large magnitude, engineering breakthroughs will be needed in which we do not degrade our limited natural resources and the ecological systems on which we all depend.

Mentioning that technology has accelerated at an incredible pace, including architecture, the Minister said that as populations grow and resources become scarcer, the efficient use of ever reducing resources at our disposal becomes more important. Our cities in near future will have to be much smarter and as part of these cities the Public Buildings and its architecture will also need to be smart. Already significant steps are being taken to evolve Smart Cities by the government. It will truly become a realization only when every component of such endeavour and every single stakeholder keeps pace with the latest in technology and trends taking shape world over.

Shri DurgaShanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA complimented CPWD for its innovative methods in completing difficult tasks in a time-bound manner. He also called for adopting the best ERP solutions in CPWD.

The Minister earlier released several publications brought out by CPWD like‘Architectural Footprints of CPWD’, ‘Conservation Audit’ and online modules on Construction Technology Year 2019-20.

                The Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Amendment Bill, 2019 which was passed by the Parliament during the Budget Session, 2019 has come into effect from today. The Gazette Notification in this regard has been issued.

This would facilitate smooth and speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from Government residential accommodations, and ensure retrieval of these residential accommodations from unauthorised occupants without requiring elaborate procedures under sections 4 and 5 of the Act. This is expected to further increase availability of Government residential accommodations for eligible persons and reduce the waiting period.

 As per the Amendment Act, the Estate officer will issue short Show cause notice of three days before eviction of the unauthorized occupant from Government accommodation.

The Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 was enacted to provide for eviction of unauthorised occupants from “public premises” and for certain incidental matters. Government provides residential accommodation on licence basis to its employees, Members of Parliament and other dignitaries while they are in service or till the term of their office. As per the existing allotment rules, after the end of eligibility as per the terms and conditions of the licence, the occupants of such residential accommodations become unauthorised occupants and are to vacate the same. The Act confers powers upon the estate officers to evict such unauthorised occupants from ""public premises"" in a smooth, speedy and time-bound manner. Under the existing provisions, the eviction proceedings of unauthorised occupants from ""public premises"" takes around five to seven weeks’ time. It may take around four more weeks in case the unauthorised occupants file appeal before the District Court under the Act. However, eviction proceedings take much longer period than the timeline prescribed in the Act. Sometimes, it takes years to evict the unauthorised occupants, especially, if the unauthorised occupant approaches higher courts.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs has stated that the land pooling policy based on public private partnership in land assembly in urban development represents a paradigmatic shift, wherein land is being pooled and is to be developed by private landowners. He further informed that the owners/group of owners can pool land parcels of any size for development as per prescribed norms and guidelines based on sectors as delineated in ZDPs. “The Policy mandates that each sector will have a 60:40 ratio with 60% of the land to be developed by Land owners/consortium for residential, commercial, partly Public Semi Public (PSP) land uses and 40% of the land to be used for various city level infrastructure requirements including roads, greens, PSP facilities, development of utilities i.e. water, sewerage, electricity etc. with involvement of private sector”, he added.  He was speaking at a Conference on ‘Land Pooling : Building India Capital – Opportunities in Real Estate and Infrastructure organized by Delhi Development Authority(DDA) in association with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry(FICCI), here today.   Shri Anil Baijal, Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Shri Tarun Kapoor, Vice Chairman, DDA besides land developers, stakeholders and urban planners were also present at the Conference.

 

Dwelling on DDA’s commitment towards operationalization of the policy on fast track mode, the Housing Minister said that DDA had launched portal for inviting Expression of Willingness for participation earlier this year wherein any landowner of contiguous land parcel of any size falling in 95 villages of Planning Zones K-1, L, N and P-II could come forward to register on the website. DDA conducted an extensive public outreach program to raise awareness about the policy and educate the citizens of Delhi on its benefits. This outreach program has paid dividends - as on 06.09.2019, a total of over 6000 hectares (approx) of land has been registered under the portal expressing their willingness for participation with maximum registrations in Planning Zone N.

The Land Pooling Policy augurs well for shaping Delhi’s urban landscape, bolstering economic growth and improving living standards. DDA proposes to take up planning of the sectors which are likely to achieve the minimum threshold of 70% as Model Sectors on priority to generate momentum in real estate and infrastructure sector. Under the policy, every 1000 hectares of pooled land will accommodate about 3,85,000 persons in approx. 85,000 Dwelling Units. About 17 lakhs Dwelling Units are expected to be constructed  of which approx. 5 lakhs will be available under EWS category. The housing generated under the Land Pooling Policy will be a key input in economic, social, and civic development of the city. Simultaneously, development of the trunk infrastructure i.e. roads, water supply, electricity supply, etc. will be taken up by DDA in coordination with the service providing agencies.

Shri Anil Baijal, LG of Delhi during his address stated that the success of the policy largely depends on the provision of fast, time bound planning and development of city level infrastructure and infusion of capital which will act as a catalyst for integrated development of the sectors and zones. “While, DDA in close coordination with service providing agencies such as Transco, DJB, local bodies etc will work towards it, the participation of the private sector is equally important.  The required capital investment for development of smart infrastructure, housing, schools, medical facilities etc. requires deliberation on collaborative models between DDA, Service providing Agencies, landowners with investors/real estate segment. This conference is a step towards this effort to partner and get on board Investors, Real Estate Developers, Banking sector and experts for making this policy a success.   Delhi is at the cusp of urban innovation and presents an untapped opportunity for Real Estate and Infrastructure Development. It is envisaged that Smart city solutions deployed in 109 land pooling sectors will turn these new urban centres in ‘smart neighbourhoods’. The envisioned city level development under the Policy will provide the high speed transport system, world class infrastructure facilities i.e. 24 hours water supply, power, pipe gas connectivity, health and education facilities in these green field areas. Therefore, it is anticipated that significant yields for both land owners and investors will be garnered with the implementation of the Policy”, he added.

Shri Tarun Kapoor, VC, DDA expressed hope that this Conference will provide an opportunity to deliberate key issues pertaining to development of Delhi.  The industry perspective was provided by Mr.Sanjay Dutt, Chairman, FICCI Real Estate Committee & Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Tata Realty and Infrastructure Ltd.

                Government of India will soon come out with an updated version of  National Water Policy to effect key changes in Water Governance Structure, Regulatory Framework, besides setting up of a National Bureau of Water Use Efficiency. Speaking at the valedictory session of the 6th India Water Week-2019 here, Union Minister for Jal Shakti Shri Gajendra Singh Sekhawat said that hydrological boundaries rather than administrative or political boundary should become part of the water governance structure in the country. He said, for this consensus building among the states within the Constitutional framework is a necessary pre-condition. 

Shri Shekhawat said said that water conservation along with water-harvesting and judicious and multiple use of water are key to tackle the water challenges in India. Calling for rejuvenation and revitalization of the traditional water bodies and resources through the age-old conservation methods, the Minister underlined the need for dissemination of modern water technologies in an extensive fashion. Dwelling on the idea of Water Trade, Shri Shekhawat said that water surplus states like Chhattisgarh can gain by sharing the resource with the deficient ones. He also asked the States to collect data on water resources and to share the same with others with an open mind.

In his address, the Minister of State for Jal Shakti Shri Rattan Lal Kataria said that demand side management of water should get priority over the supply side management and called for massive conservation of the scarce resource. Underlining the need for recycle and reuse of water, he said that Integrated Water Management is a tool for poverty reduction and sustainable economic development.

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri U.P Singh said that National Water Policy of 2012 needs major updation in the light of new challenges especially the ill-effects of climate change. Batting for policy changes for giving incentive to crops using less water, Shri Singh said that Participatory Ground Water Management should be promoted in a big way to maintain quality and sustainability.  

 India Water week was inaugurated by the President Shri Ram Nath Kovind on 24th of this month with a theme of “Water cooperation: Coping with 21st Century Challenges”. Japan and European Union were associated as partner countries for this mega event.

Ministry of Jal Shakti has been organizing India Water Week since 2012 as an international event to focus on water related issues. Five editions of India Water Week have been organized so far.  Water Resources Ministers of various States have attended the Inaugural Function. About 1500 delegates from India and abroad participated in this event, which included about 63 delegates from 28 countries. 

The event was divided into Seminars (15 nos.), Brainstorming Sessions (4 nos,), Panel Discussions (12 nos.) and Special Session (6 nos.). Apart from this, an Exhibition showcasing the technologies and solutions in water resources sector was also organized at Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA).  About 62 organizations displayed their work in the exhibition. Many reputed National and International Organizations, Research Institutes, Educational Institutions and NGOs from water resources, agriculture, power sectors participated in the event to share their knowledge and experience in the sector.

Since the launch of the SBM-G in 2014, over 10 crore toilets have been built in rural areas; over 5.9 lakh villages, 699 districts, and 35 States/UTs have declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODF). This strategy has been prepared by DDWS, in consultation with State Governments and other stakeholders, and it lays down a framework to guide local governments, policy makers, implementers and other relevant stakeholders in their planning for ODF Plus, where everyone uses a toilet, and every village has access to solid and liquid waste management.

Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Hon'ble Union Minister, Jal Shakti Mantralay, launched the strategy and said, “This strategy book is a framework to sustain the efforts of the SBM-G. The country has demonstrated unprecedented progress and all States and Union Territories have declared their rural areas open defecation free (ODF) – a befitting tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. I’d like to express my gratitude towards the State Governments for their efforts to achieve this goal. It is because of the SBM-G that India is now an inspiration, in terms of sanitation, for other countries.”

Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, said “India has seen a sanitation revolution, and the SBM-G transformed itself into a jan andolan (a people’s movement).The 10 year strategy focuses on the need for States/UTs to continue their efforts to sustain the gains of the mission through capacity strengthening, IEC (Information, education and communication), organic waste management, plastic waste management, grey water management and black water management. ” 

The strategy also speaks about potential collaborations with development partners, civil society and inter-government partnerships. It also highlights innovative models for sanitation financing.

As we prepare to dedicate a Swachh Bharat to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary on 2nd October 2019, the State Governments have been advised to ensure that no one is left behind, and in case any household does not have access to a toilet, they be facilitated to build a toilet on priority.

It has been brought to the notice of the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, that despite the Swachh Bharat Mission’s clear guidelines on the use of positive behaviour change communication towards the adoption of safe sanitation practices, there have certain been reports of inappropriate action. 

 

The Department categorically reiterates that this is unacceptable and has issued an advisory to all States on 27 September 2019, reiterating earlier advisories regarding the use of only positive behaviour change communication methods, as well as the Mission’s objective to leave no one behind in the field of sanitation. 

 

The advisory is as below:

			Government of India

			Ministry of Jal Shakti
			Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation

			Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin)

			 

			4th Floor, Pt. Deendayal Antyodaya Bhawan 

			CGO Complex, Lodhi Road 

			New Delhi-110003 

			Dated: 27th September, 2019 

			 

			To

			The Chief Secretaries

			All States/ UTs
			 

			Subject: - Advisory for adoption of non-coercive approach and ensuring that no one is left behind

			under Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin)

			 

			Madam/Sir, 

			 

			As you are aware, positive behaviour change for adoption of safe sanitation practices as well as ensuring that no one is left behind, are key to achieve the goal of the Swachh Bharat Mission. In the last five years, tireless efforts have been made by village motivators, elected panchayat officials, community-based organizations and government officials to undertake behaviour change communication to encourage rural households to stop defecating in the open and use toilets instead. This massive jan andolan has led to an unprecedented change in the rural sanitation situation of the country. People from all walks of life have shown an exemplary commitment towards making India Open Defecation Free (ODF). 

			 

			However, some recent media reports have been brought to the notice of this Department which are showing that certain forms of inappropriate actions, extreme coercive actions (particularly instance of Shivpuri district, Madhya Pradesh), are still being practiced. In this regard this Department had already issued advisory on 25th July 2017 suggesting the States to avoid any coercive measures for ensuring construction and usage of toilets. It is reiterated that coercive action taken by anybody, including government or elected officials or private individuals with respect to sanitation behaviour of any kind is totally unacceptable under any circumstance. In such cases, the concerned authorities should prosecute the guilty to the fullest extent of the applicable law. 

			 

			It is also reiterated that Central and State Governments are fully committed to the achievement and sustaining of open defecation status across rural India. As per the advisories issued on 31st July 2019 and  7th August 2019, it is reiterated that no one should be left behind, and that if there is any eligible beneficiary who has been left out, the concerned State and district should ensure that this basic service is speedily provided. 

			 

			It is requested to ensure urgent necessary action on all the above points. 

			 

			Yours faithfully,

			 

			 

			(Arun Baroka)

Speaking after giving away the National Water Mission Awards-2019 here, the Minister said that Jal-Andolan should become a true Jan-Andolan as exhorted by the Prime Minister to tide over the water scarcity in India. He also lamented the fact that only 4 percent of CSR obligation is spent on water, while it is around 11 percent for the water-intensive industries and called for a rethink on the issue. Shri Shekhawat also urged the policy planners to take into account the multiple use of water in Agriculture and Industries for the judicious use of scarce resource.

In his address, the Minister of State for Jal Shakti Shri Rattan Lal Kataria said that cooperation is a must for a sustainable tomorrow and Jal Shakti Ministry is an example in itself of such cooperation. He said that Integrated Water Management is a tool for poverty reduction and sustainable economic development.

                Union Minister for Jal Shakti Shri Gajendra Singh Sekhawat said that India is eager to share the best practices and also to learn from experiences of others on all important issues relating to water, as such discussions help in fine tuning policies and strategies for optimal utilization of this valuable resource. Addressing the 6th India Water Week-2019 here, Shri Sekhawat said, India has forged and strengthened international cooperation with 14 countries like Israel, Canada, Japan, Germany and UK in this regard. He assured the international community present in the event that any idea, strategy or plan of action which can be worth sharing is welcome, as India is aware of its responsibility towards securing a better future for our planet and we are determined to do the needful for accomplishing this goal.

The Minister said that in the face of geographical diversity of India and the problems related to waters, Ministry has come up with Jal Shakti Abhiyan, which is a collaborative effort of the Central and State Governments to accelerate progress on water conservation activities in the most water stressed blocks and districts of India. Under this campaign, the entire Government of India machinery of over 1000 senior Central Government officers have joined the States to promote focused interventions for water collection and conservation, including restoration and renovation of traditional water bodies.

The theme of this year’s India Water week inaugurated by the President Shri Ram Nath Kovind is “Water cooperation: Coping with 21st Century Challenges”. Japan and European Union have been associated as partner countries for this mega event.

In his address, the Minister of State for Jal Shakti Shri Rattan Lal Kataria said that cooperation is a must for a sustainable tomorrow and Jal Shakti Ministry is an example in itself of such cooperation. He said that for better water governance, Indian government has merged several departments related to water and sanitation into a new integrated Ministry of Jal Shakti. Prior to this landmark move, the institutional landscape for water in India had been somewhat fragmented, with about seven ministries and more than 10 departments having a say on different aspects of water and waste management. Now all these departments are working in cooperation with each other to achieve water security in the country.

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri U.P Singh said that while challenges have always existed in the water sector, climate change is the new elephant in the room. He said, climate change has major implications on water resources and India is particularly vulnerable to this aspect. He, however added that the challenges of water management present an opportunity to convert risk to resilience, poverty to well-being and degraded ecosystems to vibrant ones.

 

Ministry of Jal Shakti has been organizing India Water Week since 2012 as an international event to focus on water related issues. Five editions of India Water Week have been organized so far.  Water Resources Ministers of various States have attended the Inaugural Function. About 1500 delegates from India and abroad are participating in this event, which includes about 63 delegates from 28 countries. 

 

The event has been divided into Seminars (15 nos.), Brainstorming Sessions (4 nos,), Panel Discussions (12 nos.) and Special Session (6 nos.). These events will take place at Vigyan Bhawan. Apart from this, an Exhibition showcasing the technologies and solutions in water resources sector is also being organized at Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA).  About 60 organizations are displaying their work in the exhibition

Many reputed National and International Organizations, Research Institutes, Educational Institutions and NGOs from water resources, agriculture, power sectors etc. are participating in the event to share their knowledge and experience in the sector.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi launched Swachhata Hi Seva (SHS) 2019, a massive countrywide awareness and mobilization campaign on Swachhata at Mathura today. SHS 2019, with special focus on ‘plastic waste awareness and management’ is being organized from 11th September to October 2nd 2019, as the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) is poised to dedicate an ODF India to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. The launch of SHS was organized jointly by the central Departments of Animal Husbandry and Dairying and Drinking Water and Sanitation and the Government of Uttar Pradesh.

The Prime Minister also visited the Pashudhan Arogya Vigyan Mela, where he saw cows being operated upon to remove plastic waste from their stomachs. He then interacted with a group of women from Uttar Pradesh who segregate plastic waste into recyclables and non-recyclables, and in a unique gesture, also participated in the segregation activity himself.

Addressing an audience of about 20,000 farmers, sarpanches, women groups and swachhagrahis, the Prime Minister urged all citizens to free their houses, offices and work space from single use plastic. Drawing people’s attention to the hazardous effects of such plastic for the environment, and for the health of animals and aquatic life, he reiterated his appeal to use cloth or jute bags while going out for shopping and to use metal or earthen glasses for serving water in offices. He asked people to collect all the plastic waste from their surroundings at an identified place and to ensure its safe disposal with the support of the local administration during the Swachhata Hi Seva.

Addressing the gathering, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Yogi Adityanath applauded the positive impacts of the SBM and highlighted the contribution of SBM in dealing with the menace of deadly disease Encephalitis in eastern UP. He added that the significant increase in the sanitation coverage under SBM will now be leveraged for achieving the goal of plastic waste free India on the lines of ODF India.  

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Union Minister of Jal Shakti said that the entire world is eagerly waiting for the day when India becomes ODF. He said that the SHS 2019 campaign would give a big boost to generate mass awareness on plastic waste and its subsequent collection, recycling and disposal, and will be a new Jan Andolan for protecting environment under the inspiring leadership of the Prime Minister.

Union Minister of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Shri Giriraj Singh, Minister of State, Jal Shakti, Shri Rattan Lal Kataria, other ministers from the State and local MP and MLAs also participated in the event.

This year’s Swachhata Hi Seva will see mass awareness generation activities on plastic waste management between 11th September to 1st October, nationwide Shramdaan for plastic waste collection and segregation on 2nd October, and recycling and effective disposal of the collected plastic waste from 3rd October to Diwali, 27th October 2019. The Prime Minister has also written personal letters to all Sarpanches and Swachhagrahis, motivating them make the Swachhata Hi Seva 2019 a grand success. These letters were read out today at special Gram Sabhas across the country.

                National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has discovered 30 reels of unedited footage on Mahatma Gandhi that amounts to almost six hours of duration. These 35mm celluloid footages, unedited and stock shots with title cards in between, are taken by several prominent film studios of the time, such as Paramount, Pathe, Warner, Universal, British Movietone, Wadia Movietone etc. 

“It is indeed a very wonderful discovery for NFAI, coming at a time when the entire world is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. There seems to be some rare footages in this collection while many visuals are now part of available short films and documentaries. Some of these shots have been used but some visuals seem unique”, said Director NFAI, Shri Prakash Magdum. 

The major highlight of the discovery is a rare half-an-hour footage that has visuals of a special train carrying Mahatma Gandhi’s ashes from Madras to Rameshwaram. The stunning visuals show thousands of people thronging to stations like Chettinad, Sivaganga, Chidambaram, Manamadurai junction, Ramnad, Pudukkottai junctions in Tamil Nadu, with folded hands and tears in eyes to have a glimpse of the urn carrying the Mahatma’s ashes. The footage has visuals of a sea of humanity present at what looks like Marina beach in the then Madras city, jostling with each other carrying flags and banners to pay their last respects to the Mahatma. The train stops at major stations en route for people to pay their tribute culminating in the journey at Rameshwaram, with several important politicians from Tamil Nadu taking part in the immersion ceremony. 

A visual showing Manilal Gandhi seems to be a rare one from the collection. He was the second son of Mahatma Gandhi and served as the editor of ‘Indian Opinion’ a Gujarati-English weekly publication, at Phoenix, Durban in South Africa. There is a title card ‘Mahatma Gandhi’s Son’ while showing the visuals of Manilal Gandhi at an airport. 



Another important footage shows Mahatma’s South India tour and Harijan Yatra in January-February 1946. The film, by Projection of India Pictures, shows the visuals of Gandhi at Manapparai Railway junction and then proceeding to visit prominent temples like Sri Meenakshi temple at Madurai, Palani and Kumbakonam. The visuals also show the Mahatma attending the silver jubilee celebration of Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha at Madras along with C Rajagopalachari. 



The collection has a reel that showcases Mahatma and Kasturba engaged in various activities at Sevagram Ashram in Wardha, Maharashtra. There are visuals of Mahatma keenly taking part in tree plantation, serving the patients and in ploughing the field with a machine. An endearing visual shows Kasturaba feeding a cow in the Ashram. 

Another reel in the collection has the entire footage of the Mahatma’s voyage on board ship S Rajaputana to England to attend the Second Round Table Conference. It has candid shots of the Mahatma spinning yarn on the deck, looking through binocular, shaving, smiling, playing with children and at one point taking control of the ship with the Captain beside him!



There are visuals of the Mahatma’s visit to Ahmedabad, Porbandar and Rajkot including raw footage of his empty house, the school he attended and the library register showing his name! The footage contains the Mahatma attending the annual programme of Shri Shivaji College somewhere in Maharashtra.

The collection has visuals of his last days including those from the period just after his death, close-ups of his body and blood-stained clothes, newspaper reports of the day, Birla House, people thronging to have a darshan and the procession to Raj Ghat. 

There are several close-up shots of the Mahatma including some candid moments captured on camera. In one scene, the Mahatma is seen sharing a good laugh with an English gentleman in a train and at one moment he keeps his hand on the mouth of his fellow traveller! In another shot, the Mahatma is seen taking a stroll on a beach and enjoying it! One visual shows him keenly listening to a music player at a public gathering. Another one catches the Mahatma exchanging and then coolly sharing a garland with a small girl with a mischievous smile!



The collection also has some rare visuals of VD Savarkar looking into the camera. There is also exclusive footage of Haripura Congress session with shots of Subhash Chandra Bose. Many major political leaders of the time including Pt Nehru, Sardar Patel, Sarojini Naidu, Maulana Azad figure prominently in the footage. The Mahatma’s meeting with Rabindranath Tagore also figures in the collection. There are extensive visuals of the Mahatma’s visit to the UK and France, which are covered by several film studios. 

There are two reels having only audio that has the voice of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan, known as Frontier Gandhi. It seems some footage is from the documentary film on Gandhi by AK Chettiar that is unavailable till now. Also, some footage seems to have found a place in a long documentary made by Vitthalbhai Jhaveri. Some visuals seem to be from Kanu Gandhi collection. 

A very wonderful discovery at a time, celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of #MahatmaGandhi. NFAI has discovered 30 reels of unedited footage on #Mahatma.

The condolence meeting at UN Headquarters just after Mahatma’s death are also part of this collection. Apart from representatives of several nations paying tribute, a visual of India’s representative at UN can be seen in the footage.

“This is a fascinating visual collection of the Mahatma and a real surprise to find it in celluloid format in today’s times. The 35 mm footage is in Master Positive format and does not have sound. We have made duplicate negative for long-term preservation and then copied it into Release Positive, which is an exhibition format. The primary inspection indicates the material is in good condition and we will soon plan to digitize it. We also plan to invite scholars and historians to throw more light and get information for cataloguing the entire collection”, said Prakash Magdum.

                Pune, 15 September 2019

Newly restored Jayakar Bungalow, an iconic heritage structure of Pune, was inaugurated today by Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister of Information and Broadcasting and Environment, Forest and Climate Change at National Film Archive of India (NFAI). The bungalow will house a digital film library where film researchers can access the rich film database of the Archive. Also available would be personalised viewing spaces for watching a movie from NFAI collection. The Minister released a special booklet ‘Parampara: An ode to Jayakar Bungalow’ that chronicles the history of bungalow along with the story of its restoration. A special feature of the booklet is the experiences shared by some of the renowned film artists including Shabana Azmi and Rehana Sultan among others, who had stayed in Jayakar Bungalow as part of FTII girls hostel. The Minister also launched a mobile app for booking the slot for viewing films at NFAI. 



The Minister said the Jayakar Bungalow has a special place in the art and architecture of Pune and now after restoration this is being put in use for the benefit of film researchers. He felicitated Ms Prasanna Gokhale, the great-granddaughter of Br MR Jayakar, who was especially present on this occasion. The Minister complimented the NFAI team along with CCW and the Conservation team for the efforts taken to restore the building.



A grade I heritage structure, the bungalow was built in the 1940s by Barrister M R Jayakar, a renowned national leader, member of the Constituent Assembly and first Vice-Chancellor of the University of Pune. Over the years, the ownership of the bungalow changed hands from Br Jayakar to Indian Law Society to FTII and then to NFAI. From 1973, NFAI functioned from it's premises. 



The bungalow built in Tudor style of Architecture which is mostly found in Great Britain, is one of its kind in Pune. The exquisitely designed bungalow has wooden flooring, a narrow wooden staircase, typical of British architecture and massive bookshelves that stretch on almost to the roof. The two-storied bungalow is built in a load-bearing system with the use of coursed Stone Ashlars Masonry with lime mortar. Serene Interiors, complete with ceramic tiles and wooden ceiling. 



For many years, large portions of the bungalow remained unused as the main activities of the Archive shifted to its present building in the 1990s. Therefore it was felt that restoration should be carried out to give it a major facelift. A most significant rule of restoration was applied throughout the project that is to use maximum salvaged materials. In the first phase, all the later additions and alterations were carefully removed that let the structure breathe after many years. While maintaining the heritage status of the structure, new technology was introduced considering the current times and future usages. The bungalow has been restored to it's most possible original form and put in adaptive reuse.



“We wanted to restore the unique architecture and aesthetic value to bring back the glory of the olden times. The objective was to conserve the heritage structure and make it contemporary so that it can be accessible for citizens and film lovers. The digital library and personalised viewing spaces are the steps in this direction. We want this place to be a hub of cultural activities where film lovers can come and engage into meaningful conversations”, said Prakash Magdum, Director NFAI.

                Union Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar today announced that 118 new Community Radio Stations (CRS) are in the process of being set-up. 

#CommunityRadio is a great way to communicate with the public and to give opportunities to local artists. We are going to expand community radio to many other areas which will start in a few months: Union Minister @PrakashJavdekar pic.twitter.com/c8UuMM3T1r— PIB India (@PIB_India) September 13, 2019



The approved list of applicants having been granted Letter of Intent for setting up CRS includes 16 from Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts, 6 from most LWE affected districts, 25 from coastal districts, 17 from Aspirational Districts, 3 from North-East and 2 from Jammu and Kashmir. Applications from NGOs, Educational Institutions - both private and public, and Krishi Vigyan Kendras have been granted approvals. It is expected that these Community Radio Stations will become operational within the next six months. 

Community Radio Stations act as essential communication channels for enhancing last mile of outreach of government. Plans are underway to ensure expansion of the community radio network to each district of the country. 

 

Brief Background about Community Radio Stations

Community Radios are small (low power) FM radio stations with a coverage area of around 10-15 Km radius, depending on the geography of the area. CRS play a significant role in dissemination of agriculture related information, government schemes for people’s welfare, weather forecast etc. CRS are expected to produce at least 50% of their programmes locally, as far as possible in local languages or dialects. More than two hundred sixty CRS across India, broadcasting in various languages including local dialects, give marginalised communities a platform to make their voice heard and an opportunity to express their views.

दिव्यांगों के लिए मोदी सरकार ने एक अहम निर्णय लिया है,

जिन्हें सुनने में दिक्कत होती है उनके लिए #DDNews रोज #SignLanguage के आधार पर एक बुलेटिन प्रकाशित करता है ऐसी ही पहल सभी निजी चैनल भी करें यह हमने दरख़ास्त की है और उन्होंने भी मंजूर की है @PrakashJavdekar pic.twitter.com/BNLc0gX11p

In the discussions, Ms Hannah Fisher, Programming Head of Heartland International Film Festival of USA, suggested that there could be a special focus on India for the Festival commencing from 10th October 2019 under the ‘Foreign Language Category. Ms Fisher said that this would help in enhancing the positioning of Golden Jubilee Edition of IFFI 2019 among the participants and international audience at the Festival.

The meeting  discussed the possibility of enhancing presence of Indian film across North America continent along with exploring business opportunities & collaboration ventures to ensure growth of M&E sector.

 

The discussion with senior representatives from the Global-gate Entertainment – Mr William Pfeiffer & Ms Meg Thompson - focused on the policy framework of films under the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India – especially in the context of ease of filming in India. While appreciating the Government of India’s initiatives on ease of shooting, Mr Pfeiffer suggested if the process of incentivisation could be fast-tracked, it would provide value to the structure & framework, which would help boost film-making in India. They also agreed to sensitize participants about IFFI 2019 and suggested to provide names of eminent directors, film-makers, producers and actors who can be invited to IFFI this year.

 

Ms Philippa Mossman, Head of International Screen Attraction, New Zealand Film Commission and representatives from the Israel film fund discussed possibilities of collaborations on convening Festivals; India being the “focus country” in both the festivals and fast-tracking of co-production agreements.  The Indian Delegation also met with Mr Thomas Rado, President/ CEO, Gibraltar & Palme and Ms Dilani Rabindran, with whom the prospect of participation in the 50th Edition of IFFI was discussed.

Addressing the gathering, the Minister congratulated winners for their hard work and commitment towards excellence. Appreciating the role of DG FASLI in promoting safety for industrial workers, the Minister said that Ministry of Labour and Employment has decided to open the offices of DG FASLI and DG MINES in Jammu & Kashmir post revocation of article 35-A and 370. Also the office of EPFO will be opened in J&K and Leh to provide social security to the workers of these areas, Shri Gangwar added.

For the Performance year 2017, the total number of NSA Award Winners and Runners-up in all the twelve schemes adds up to 130 (81 winners &49 runners-up), who have been selected out of 288 applications received under various schemes.

Talking about the upcoming initiatives of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Minister said that the draft of ‘Code on Social Security’ is ready and will be shared with stakeholders for their comments soon. 

Background:

 

The Ministry of Labour and Employment has been operating the ""Vishwakarma Rashtriya Puraskar (VRP)"" (Previously known as ShramVir National Awards) and ""National Safety Awards (NSA)"" since 1965. These Award schemes are operated by the technical wing of the Ministry, namely the Directorate General Factory Advice Service & Labour Institutes (DGFASLI), Mumbai - an attached office of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. DGFASLI renders technical advice/service to workers, their representatives & managements in factories and docks to make the industrial activities safe and to promote workers' health & well-being. 

 

Vishwakarma Rashtriya Puraskar (VRP)

VRP is awarded in recognition of outstanding suggestions given by a worker or a group of workers and implemented by the management during the previous calendar year resulting in improvement in quality, productivity, savings to the unit including savings in foreign currency and working conditions such as safety, health and environmental conservation in the industrial undertakings where ""Suggestion Schemes"" are in operation.

VRP is awarded in the form of cash prize and a certificate of merit in three categories: Class 'A' - Five(05) awards of Rs. 75,000/- each, Class 'B' - Eight(08) awards of Rs. 50,000/- each and Class 'C'- Fifteen(15) awards of Rs. 25,000/- each. For the Performance Year 2017 a total of 197 applications were received from different industries out of which 28 awards have been conferred. These 28 awards are being shared by 131 individuals.

 

National Safety Awards (NSA)

The NSA is given in recognition of outstanding safety performance of industrial establishments, construction sites, ports and installations under Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) to stimulate and maintain the interests of both the management and the workers in accident prevention programs. The awards are given under twelve schemes, out of which ten are meant for Factories /Construction sites /Installations under AERB and two are for Ports. Under each award, a Shield and a Certificate of Merit is given to each of the Award Winners and Runners-up. The establishments are classified in different schemes on the basis of working of man-hours.

The criterion for presentation of these Awards is indicated as below:

 


	Lowest Average Frequency Rate over a period of three consecutive years ending in the performance year as compared to the National Average for that group of industries.
	Accident Free year based on man-hours worked during the performance year.


 

For the Performance year 2017, the total number of NSA Award Winners and Runners-up in all the twelve schemes adds up to 130 (81 winners &49 runners-up), who have been selected out of 288 applications received under various schemes.

The VRP and NSA awards work both as an impetus as well as a catalyst to unleash the latent and untapped potentials of the promising workers at the plant level while recognizing the excellent performance of the companies in preventing accidents and promoting safety at work place. These awards bring out hidden talents of workers in our country. The goal is to develop a culture of safety in our industries with simple inventions or modifications. We know that we are not alone in our goals, that without others we cannot succeed, and so by exercising these awards, we emphasise on nurturing the hidden talents of workers and organizations in our country. We as a nation want to enable healthy, active lives through our skills and knowledge, while also seeking reasonable limits to potential harms that ensure these lives can be lived unhindered, and unburdened by fatal and life-changing accidents. These awards stimulate and sustain the interest of both management and workers alike in accident prevention and safety promotional programmes. 

The applications of these awards are invited through wide publicity all across the country. The applications thus received for VRP as well as NSA are adjudged by a Tripartite Awards Committee consisting of representation from employers' organizations, employees' organizations and Central/State Governments. This Tripartite Committee is constituted by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India. Apart from the tripartite representation, there are also experts on the Committee from renowned Institutions, Universities and industry in the field of safety, health, environment, productivity and quality.

In the meeting, approval has been accorded to provide cashless Secondary and Tertiary medical care services under Ayushman Bharat package rates to entitled ESI Beneficiaries in newly implemented area of 102 designated Districts through PMJAY empanelled hospitals in States where PMJAY has been adopted by the State Governments.

Further, various State Government running ESIS Medical Scheme, shall also be requested to enrol ESIS Hospitals under Ayushman Bharat Scheme for providing medical services to PMJAY Beneficiaries, similar to ESIC Hospitals.

                The Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi launched at Ranchi today, the National Pension Scheme for Traders and Self Employed Persons, a pension scheme for the Vyaparis (shopkeepers/retail traders and self-employed persons) with annual turnover not exceeding Rs 1.5 crore. The Governor of Jharkhand Smt. Draupadi Murmu, Chief Minister of Jharkhand Shri Raghubar Das, Minister of Tribal Affairs Shri Arjun Munda, Minister of State  for Labour & Employment (I/C) Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.  With this nation-wide launch, the facility for enrollment under the scheme has been made available to the prospective beneficiaries through 3.50 lakh Common Service Center (CSCs) across the country. In addition people can also self-enroll by visiting the portal www.maandhan.in/vyapari. The eligible Vyaparis can visit their nearest CSCs and get enrolled under the scheme. At the time of enrollment, the beneficiary is required to have an Aadhaar card and a saving bank/ Jan-dhan Account passbook only. He/ She should be within 18 to 40 years of age group. GSTIN is required only for those with turnover above Rs. 40 lakhs. The enrolment under the scheme is free of cost for the beneficiaries. The enrolment is based upon self-certification. 

 

Government has approved National Pension Scheme for Traders and Self Employed Persons in acknowledgement of notable contribution of Vyaparis (shopkeepers/ retail traders and self-employed persons). It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for entry age of 18 to 40 years with a provision for minimum assured pension of Rs 3,000/- monthly on attaining the age of 60 years. The beneficiary should not be income tax payer and also not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS (Govt.)/PM-SYM. The Central Government shall give 50 % share of the monthly contribution and remaining 50% contribution shall be made by the beneficiary. The monthly contribution is kept low to make it affordable. For example, a beneficiary is required to contribute as little as Rs.100/- per month at a median entry age of 29 years.  

This pension scheme is one of the top priorities of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Government in its second term. According to the Ministry’s 100-day plan, this scheme will target enrolling 25 lakh subscribers in 2019-20 and 2 crore subscribers by 2023-2024. An estimated 3 crore Vyaparis in the country are expected to be benefitted under the pension scheme.

The e-payment integration would effect statutory benefit payments to ESIC beneficiaries as well as other payees on real time basis, reducing time lags and delays and at the same time, help to eliminate mistakes and errors caused by repetitive and manual data entries. The new system will benefit all stakeholders of ESIC. The agreement was signed in the presence of Shri Rajkumar, DG, ESIC and Shri Sunil Wadhera, DGM, SBI.

                Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries has stressed that technology should be used with a view to improve the life condition of poorest of the poor. The Minister inaugurated the workshop on Outreach of Emerging Technologies to MSMEs in New Delhi today.

He said that technology is needed for production, preservation and marketing of products and coping up with new technologies is essential to compete in the global market. Our Prime Minister’s dream of making India a five trillion dollar economy can be achieved by growth of MSME’s through adopting new technologies. 

He cautioned against over application of technology which sometimes goes against nature. Technology should be used to make better the life of poorest of poor, it should enhance the standard of living of the ‘have nots’.

The primary objective of this workshop is awareness generation and dissemination of knowledge about some of the emerging technologies, their applications, the kind of potential they offer, the impact they can have on the sector, challenges faced in adoption and some relevant models from around the world. The other aim is to chart a way forward for institution-institution collaboration to make the penetration of these technologies to the MSMEs faster and effective. For this purpose, the ministry has invited reputed dignitaries from different educational institutes like IIT Delhi, IISc Bengaluru, Department of Science and Technology etc., industry associations and different players operating in the market.

Secretary, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Shri Arun Panda said that MSMEs should have access to and be able to adopt latest and new technologies and appealed to business associations to help MSMEs in technology upgradation and access to credit. Referring to Government of India’s efforts, he said that currently we are running 18 Tool rooms and 15 more tool rooms are under construction. Apart from them, 120 new Tool Rooms/Technology centres have been approved and these 153 centres when fully operational will train approximately eight lakh youngsters in various skills.

Development Commissioner, MSME Shri Ram Mohan Mishra said that our country has many good Research Institutes, Technology Institutes and Scientific Labs and it is their pious duty to equip the small industries to provide and equip them with latest technologies to increase their production. He appealed the business associations to help small industries in this endeavour. 

The MSME sector has been recognized globally as a major contributor to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The sector occupies a position of strategic importance, currently, there are over 60 million MSMEs across various industries that employs more than 111 million persons and produces more than 8000 products ranging from traditional to high-tech precision items. The manufacturing landscape is changing rapidly and there is a strong need for MSMEs to be agile and flexible to be able to survive this change. This workshop has been organized to meet these challenges. 

In the day long workshop, Shri Sunil Jha, IIT Delhi and many other experts demonstrated their presentation on Emerging Technologies like artificial intelligence, collaborative robots, smart sensing, real time dashboards etc. which can be very useful for the stakeholders.

                The Khadi and Village Industries Corporation (KVIC) under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises proposes to establish National Design and Product Development Centres in the country to facilitate Khadi institutions develop trendy designs as per market demand. Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister for MSME and Road Transport & Highways presided over a brainstorming session in New Delhi today, to discuss the modalities and way forward in this regard. Secretary MSME Dr Arun Kumar Panda, Secretary Textiles Shri Ravi Capoor, Chairman KVIC Shri VK Saxena, reputed designers Ms RituBeri, Shri Rohit Bal, Shri JJ Valaya , Shri RaghavendraRathor and senior officials from the Ministries of MSME and Textiles, KVIC,  National Institute of Design (NID), National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) attended the meeting. 

Speaking on the occasion Shri Gadkari said that in order to maximize the production and sale of khadi and make it a global brand, there is a need for to make its designs more trendy and modern, without compromising with tradition. He saidwe need to make khadi attractive for the youth of the country. The product designs should be aligned to customer choices and demand, and take into account the local and regional preferences and requirements like weather condition, local designs etc.

The proposed design houses will  facilitateKhadi institutions in developing  products according to market demand. The primary role of a design house will be to identify the latest design trends, adopt them as per customer needs and undertake various testing and review activities for translating them into production. Design house will help Khadi to gain customers’ trust and lead to increase in production and employment generation. 

Shri Gadkari has asked the designers to send their ideas and suggestions in this regard to KVIC and Ministry of MSME for further discussions.

KVIC’s proposal is to set up four design houses – one each in the eastern, western, northern, southern parts of the country, besides one in the  north east. These could be on BOT mode or on Outsourcing basis. However, these issues,  would be worked out in further meetings and discussions.

                It was dream come true for leather artisans hailing from Delhi and neighbouring areas, when the Union Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Shri Nitin Gadkari called them as Charm-Chikitsak (Leather Doctors) and distributed advanced Leather Tool Kits among nearly 150 Leather Artisans at a function held under the aegis of Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) today in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion held under 150th Birth Anniversary Celebration Year of Mahatma Gandhi, the minister said that leather industry is one of the pioneer village industries and leather craft had immense potential of job creation, especially in the rural areas. He said that KVIC has manifested the idea of ‘Antyodaya’ and ‘Swablamban’ (self-reliance). The idea behind it is to support the leather artisans with a micro financial assistance so that they may start producing the leather products according to need of the market. They will now be known as ‘Charm Chikitsak (Leather Doctors), he said and informed that the KVIC had so far established 419 units within last 3 years under the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP).

Shri Gadkari said that social and economic equality in society will not come from speeches only but with real action. Distribution of Tool Kit to leather artisans in such an action. It is real dedication to Mahatma Gandhi’s spirit. We are working regularly for economically and socially backward sectors. Now Kulhads will be used for tea at 400 Railway Station which will give employment to Kumhars. He also appealed the leather artisans to improve the quality of their produce and assured that government will give all financial assistance to them in this connection.

Appreciating KVIC’s efforts in uplifting the marginalized community, Shri Gadkari added that in the coming days, leather art and craft industry will be one of the significant village industry under KVIC and the lost glory in this sector will be returned back again MSME has extended an additional support of Rs 25 crores for overall development of leather art and craft industry.

KVIC Chairman Shri Vinai Kumar Saxena, in his welcome address, said that believing in Mahatma Gandhi’s principle of self-reliance and Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s mantra of inclusive growth, KVIC is committed to ensure the development of last man left in the society. With these programmes, we can bring changes in the lives of marginalized people. It will not only increase the income of charm-chikitsak in manifold, but will also give them social security and acceptance he said and informed that in the current financial year, KVIC would distribute another 70,000 Leather Tool Kits among the trained leather-doctors.

New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi and former Rajya Sabha MP K.C. Tyagi also addressed the function.

                Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Road Transport & Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that reducing the cost of capital, logistics and power are crucial for making the Indian MSME sector globally competitive. The Minister inaugurated the 16th Global SME Business Summit 2019 in New Delhi today. 

 

The Summit is organized every year by Ministry of MSME and Confederation of Indian Industries (CII).  The theme this year is  Making Indian MSMEs Globally Competitive.  

 

Calling for domestic and foreign  investment and collaboration in the sector, Shri Gadkari said that the MSME sector in India has tremendous potential to push growth and generate employment. He said the government’s priority is for an integrated development of the rural and agro based enterprises along with the urban based enterprises.  Opportunities abound in development of honey, bamboo, textiles, bio-fuels, water transport, fisheries, dairy, food processing in the rural areas and ancillary units of defence, railways, highways, waterways and other industries in the urban areas, he said, and appealed to investors to come forward for investment and collaboration.  

 

The Minister said his Government’s target is to increase MSME’s  present share of 29 percent of GDP to 50 percent in next five years and raise its export contribution from 49 percent to  60 percent . To achieve these targets logistics, power and capital cost will need to be reduced. 

 

For cheaper capital, the Ministry is in talks with ADB, KfW and World Bank for their credit line. 200 SMEs are registered on the stock exchange, and the Minister is urging more companies to register. The problem of delayed payments to MSMEs is also being looked into and Shri Gadkari said the UK Sinha Committee Report will soon be implemented. 

 

For lowering cost of power and logistics the Minister pointed to the necessity of energy audits and energy efficient technologies. He said roof top solar plants will be provided to MSMEs with KfW support. He also said that the  use of water transport can reduce logistic cost. 

 

Shri Gadkari  further said that our Ministry will soon launch a new E-Commerce website ‘Bharat Mart’ to enable MSMEs to sell their products in local as well as international markets. 

 

 

Also speaking on the occasion Secretary, MSME  Dr. Arun Kumar Panda informed that the Ministry is in the process of developing a digital MSME portal which will work as a virtual meeting place for all stakeholders of the sector. For the  over 75 lakh MSMEs currently registered with the Ministry, this will provide a platform where they can interact globally to fulfil their requirements for funding, knowledge, technology, skilling and  marketing, making them more competitive and integrated with the global value chain. He also emphasized on the need to enhance manufacturing competitiveness of entrepreneurs, and said that we are in the process of opening new 135 new Tool Rooms & Technology centres to develop the skill of the entrepreneurs. 

 

The summit was attended by more than 500 delegates from more than 15 countries. Country sessions with South Korea and Saudi Arabia along with panel discussion on ‘Can MSME’s Contribute 50 percent to Indian’s GDP?’were also organized today. Shri Gadkari also released the theme paper of the Summit ‘Making Indian SMEs Globally Competitive.  

On second day of the summit tomorrow, workshops will be held  on Trade through E-Commerce Digitization besides Country Sessions, Regional Sessions and B2B Meetings .

                Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that non payment and delay in payments to MSME enterprises will be dealt with very firmly. The Minister reiterated the Government's commitment to solve long standing problems of the MSME sector and give it the required support so that it can realize its full potential in terms of its contribution to GDP and employment generation. The Minister was speaking at a national workshop organized by the MSME Ministry to discuss the issue of delayed payments to MSMEs and ways to deal with it. He said that the Finance Ministry has recently taken some initiatives for the sector which will go a long way in strengthening it. Shri Gadkari further assured that the recommendations of the UK Sinha committee will be implemented soon.

Besides Ministry officials and bankers, the workshop is being attended by entrepreneurs and various stakeholders from the MSME sector. Presentations were made by TReDS, Bombay Stock Exchange, Chamber of Indian MS&M Enterprises, NeSL (National e-governance Services Limited) on the initiatives that are being taken to tackle the problem of delayed payments. Many stakeholders suffering from delayed payments, spoke about their complaints and placed suggestions before the Minister and senior officials.

Shri Gadkari appealed all the stakeholders to use MSME Samadhan Portal so that sufficient data could be gathered about wilful defaulters, register themselves on stock exchanges and also assured them that the ministry will soon launch a marketing portal ‘Bharat Craft’ for the marketing of their products. Ministry has already notified that all companies registered with the Companies Act, 2013 with a turnover of more than Rs. 500 crore and all Central Public Sector Enterprises shall be required to get themselves onboarded on the TReDS (Trade Receivables Discounting System) platform, set up as per the notification of the Reserve Bank of India.

The Ministry has also notified that all companies who get supplies of goods or services from Micro and Small Enterprises and whose payments to suppliers exceeds 45 days from the date of acceptance of the goods or services, shall submit a half yearly return of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs stating the amount of payments due and reason of the delay.

Secretary MSME Shri Arun Kumar Panda assured stakeholders that all their suggestions and problems will be looked into by the Ministry. 

Shri Nitin Gadkari also Re-Launched the Credit Linked Capital Subsidy (CLCS) web portal on the occasion. CLCS is a scheme that provides 15% subsidy for additional investment up to ₹ 1 cr. for technology upgradation by MSEs. In the relaunched scheme there is an additional 10 percent subsidy to SC-ST entrepreneurs. MoUs were also signed by the office of DC, MSME with 11 Nodal Banks.

                Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) launched a first ever ‘Terracotta Grinder’ at Sewapuri in Varanasi. This machine will grind the wasted and broken pottery items for re-using in pottery-making.

KVIC Chairman Shri Vinai Kumar Saxena said that earlier the wasted pottery items were grinded in normal khal-musal (mortar and pestle) and its fine powder was mixed with the normal clay. Mixing this powder in stipulated ratio to normal clay makes the resulting pottery items stronger.  This Terracotta grinder will make grinding of wasted pottery items faster than the traditional mortar and pestle. It will lessen the cost of production, and will also help in solving the problem of shortage of clays. He said the cost of one tractor trolley of clay is Rs 2,600 in the Varanasi area. By mixing 20 percent of this wasted terracotta powder, the potter will make a saving of at least Rs 520.  This will also create more job opportunities in the villages. The grinder was designed by KVIC Chairman, and fabricated by a Rajkot-based engineering unit  

On this occasion, the KVIC Chairman also distributed 200 Electric Potter Wheels and other pottery machines among the villagers. This will not only create 900 new jobs, but will also meet the growing demand for terracotta products at Varanasi railway station following a direction by the Ministry of Railways to Zonal Railways and IRCTC to take urgent necessary action to ensure use of locally produced, environment friendly terracotta products like Kulhad, glasses and plates for serving passengers through all static catering units at Varanasi and Raibareilly railway stations.

This machine will be a boon for potters as Union Minister of MSME Shri Nitin Gadkari has proposed to introduce kulhads and other terracotta products at 400 prominent railway stations. The proposal is under active consideration of the Railways.

 KVIC, as part of its commitment to Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, had also started manufacturing of plastic-mixed handmade paper at Kumarappa National Handmade Paper Institute (KNHPI), a KVIC unit in Jaipur under its project REPLAN (REducing PLAstic in Nature). In this project, the waste plastic is collected, cleaned, chopped, beaten and treated for softness. After that, it is mixed with the paper raw material i.e. cotton rags pulp in a ratio of 80 % (pulp) and 20% (plastic waste). The institute has sold over six lakh handmade plastic mixed carry bags since September 2018.

                The National Geoscience Awards for the year 2018 for outstanding contributions in the field of geosciences, mining and allied areas were presented to twenty-two scientists from across the country. The Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines, Shri Pralhad Joshi, while conferring the awards said that the need of the hour is to strengthen the synergy between the professional and academic institutions working in field of geoscience. 

The National Geoscience Awards were given in ten disciplines covering Mineral exploration, Groundwater exploration, Mining technology, Mineral beneficiation, Sustainable mineral development, Basic and applied geosciences, Geo-environmental studies and Natural hazards investigation.  Prof. Syed Wajih Ahmad Naqvi, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), received the Award for Excellence for his significant global contributions in the field of aquatic biogeochemical research. Dr. Sohini Ganguly, of Goa University was conferred with the Young Scientist Award-2018 for her significant work in the fields of petrology, volcanology and geochemistry.

Highlighting the demand for the mineral resources in the country, Shri Pralhad Joshi called upon the geoscientific community to come up with innovative means of finding deep seated and concealed mineral resources while causing least ecological disturbance. He said that the Government has brought out the National Mineral Policy 2019 and aims to increase mineral production (in value terms) by 200% in 7 years.

The minister expressed hope that after the completion of National Aero-geophysical Mapping Program covering 27 lakh line km of Obvious Geological Potential by the GSI, the mineral potential zones would be identified leading to auctionable mineral blocks.  In the current field season, Geological Survey of India has almost doubled its exploration activity by implementing about 400 mineral exploration projects on various mineral commodities.

Highlighting the transformative investor friendly interventions undertaken in the mining sector, Shri Pralhad Joshi said that the MMDR Amendment Act, 2015 has brought in transparency in competitive auction process and grant of mineral concessions. The setting up of National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) and District Mineral Foundation (DMF) are steps in this regard, he added. The Government has also set up the Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojna (PMKKY) to ensure long-term sustainable livelihoods for the affected people in mining areas, he said.

The Minister of Mines, Shri Pralhad Joshi, at the end of the award ceremony, interacted with the awardees about their current research work and future roadmap.

Earlier, in the welcome address, Shri Anil Mukim, Secretary, Mines outlined the background of this Award which was initiated way back in 1966 by the Ministry of Mines and has evolved since then with inclusion of new domains of geoscience in the list of awards to recognize the contribution of geoscientists not only in the field of mineral exploration but also in other disciplines of geosciences. Till date, the NGA has been awarded to 820 geoscientists and engineers from various institutions in the country. Shri S. N. Meshram, Director General, Geological Survey of India (GSI) and other senior officials of the Ministry of Mines and GSI were present on the occasion.

                To commemorate 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and to promote the Gandhian idea of sustainable living, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy in association with IIT Bombay, is organizing the Global Student Solar Assembly on 2nd October 2019. The day-long event scheduled at Indira Gandhi Stadium Complex, New Delhi will see participation of over 10,000 students from across the institutions from National Capital Region and Delhi. These students will be accompanied by their trainers who would provide them hands-on training on how to assemble their own solar study lamps.

With the severe threat of climate change looming large, world is increasingly turning towards Gandhian ideas of environmental care and sustainable living. Gandhi Ji’s concept of non-violence went beyond human race and envisaged non violence towards environment as well. His maxim that, “The earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed” has to be our guiding principal in our fight against climate change. For India fight against climate change is a matter of faith and commitment. India has committed to reduce its carbon intensity by 33-35 % by the year 2030 and to install cumulative renewable energy capacity of 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.

This Workshop aims at sensitizing young minds about energy sustainability and environmental care. While making their own solar lamps, the students will also get introduced to the concept of self sufficiency – another idea that was so close to the heart of Mahatma Gandhi.  At the end, all students will switch-on their self-assembled solar lamps in remembrance of Mahatma and will take pledge of non-violence towards the environment.

Two Guinness world records will be attempted during this workshop, (a) sustainability lessons to the largest number of participants at a single place (b) largest number of solar lamps lit together. 

In addition to the event at New Delhi, similar workshops will be organised in other Indian cities and also in foreign countries. It is expected that more than 1 million students in 60 countries will join this global event on a single day and will become Renewable Energy Ambassadors to carry the message green energy far and beyond.

                The MoS (PP) Dr Jitendra Singh addressed the Valedictory Session of the Special Training Program for the Civil Servants of Maldives and Bangladesh here today. The event was attended by senior officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and senior officials from the High Commission of Bangladesh to India and the Embassy of Maldives to India.

The 2-week long Special Training program was conducted by the National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG) at Mussoorie and Delhi in pursuance of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India-Bangladesh and India-Maldives which were signed for training 1800 civil servants of Bangladesh and 1000 civil servants of Maldives over a period of 5 years. In all 33 officials from Maldives and 31 officials from Bangladesh participated in the Training Program.

 In his valedictory address, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that this training program is an extension of multi-faceted relations that exist between India and both countries. He said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always emphasised on the ‘Neighbourhood First” policy. He expressed happiness over the fact that India today has achieved a level in civil services training which is being emulated by other countries. He said that many students are visiting India from neighbouring countries for studies. Dr Singh said that India has focussed on ‘maximum governance and minimum government’. India has done away with interview at lower level posts and attestation of documents, which shows its confidence and trust in its citizens. He said that ease of governance is nothing, but ease of living. 

The Minister said that about 1500 obsolete laws have been done away in the last 5 years period, as they were adding more ‘unease’ than ‘ease’ to governance. He also said that the technology has been put to optimum use during these years. The Grievance Portal has become very active and responsive, he added. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that best practices in India can be adopted by the trainee civil servants. He also asked them for their inputs and suggestions and said that there is much that needs to be learnt from each other. He said that the governance can be improved by mutual consultations. 

The Ambassador of the Republic of Maldives to India Ms Aishath Mohamed Didi said that it was a pleasure and privilege to speak on the occasion. She said that there is so much that the Maldivian Civil servants could learn from the training program. She added that e-governance was a way forward which needs to be learnt. She added that Maldives will continue this cooperation. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Aly Shameen, Chairman of the Civil Services Commission of Maldives said that India is the largest democracy and a technologically advancing country. He added that the training has helped in transfer of knowledge and technological know-how. He also mentioned about the Smart City project, Aadhar card and National Disaster Management guidelines of India. He congratulated the trainees and thanked the NCGC faculty for conducting the training program. 

 

The Joint Secretary, MEA, Ms Devyani Khobragade said that this training program was a part of ITEC program of Ministry of External Affairs. She said that it has helped in sharing experiences and knowledge and India's unique experiences being a diversified country. She said that India sees them as equal partners in the development story and this is a beginning of a new relationship.

 

Shri K. V. Eapen said that ITEC is an extremely useful program for India where we can include civil servants from neighboring countries. He said India has already trained 1500 civil servants from Bangladesh and will train 1800 more in near future. He added that India prepares training program based on the relevance for that country, and provides training in the areas which can be implemented in their respective countries. He said that world over demand of citizens is for better governance. He added this is a two- way program, where we all can learn from each other. 

 

Earlier delivering his welcome address, Shri V.Srinivas Additional Secretary DARPG said that in many ways India’s governance has transformed beyond recognition since the widespread adoption of Digital India programs. He said that Governance can be Transformed: through purposeful digitalization, enabling infrastructure and responsive institutions. He also mentioned about the historic Shillong Declaration adopted in the National Conference on e-Governance which lays down the roadmap for e-Governance of India. He said that CPGRAMS Reforms – India’s digital portal for public grievances redressal  adopted a bottom up approach which is expected to bring massive improvements in the quality and reduction in timelines of grievance redressal. The triology of digital continuum of administrative reforms is complete today with the successful conclusion of the special training program for civil servants of Maldives and Bangladesh representing the best success story of South-South cooperation, he added.

The program was conducted under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation program (ITEC) from September 16-28, 2019 at Mussoorie and Delhi. The inaugural session of the Special Training Program for Maldivian Civil Servants was held on September 16, 2019 and was chaired by Shri K. V. Eapen, Secretary DARPG, Ms. Fatimath Amira, Member Civil Services Commission and Shri V. Srinivas, Additional Secretary DARPG. This was followed by sessions on Public Policy and Governance, Ethics and Accountability and Redressal of Public Grievances, Motivation, Innovation, Sustainable Development Goals, Promoting Tourism, Regional Cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region, India – Maldives Relations along with visits to Unique Identification Authority, Passport Sewa Kendra and Election Commission of India.

The Prime Minister of India in his visit to Maldives in June 2019, had emphasised India's ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and assured India's full support to Maldives in realising its aspirations for broad based socio-economic development and strengthening of democratic and independent institutions. One of the MoUs signed during the visit was between the National Center for Good Governance, India and the Civil Services Commission of Maldives which envisaged capacity building activities for 1000 Civil Servants of Maldives at the National Centre for Good Governance over the next 5 years. 

Under the MoU, 10 training programmes will be conducted from September 2019 to December 2020. The first 3 training programs under the MoU would be held in 2019 (a) September 16-28, 2019 and November 18-30, 2019 for 60 officers of the middle management level (b) December 2-14, 2019 for 30 officers of top management level.

                The MoS (PP) Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has focussed on digitalisation in the functioning from the very beginning. He said that the priority of the Government is to provide transparent and citizen-centric governance to the people. He was addressing at the launch of Centralised Public Grievances Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) reforms in Department of Posts, at a function organised by Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, here today. The Secretary (DARPG & Pensions) Shri K. V. Eapen and Director General Posts, Smt Meera Handa and senior officers were also present on the occasion. The Grievance officers representing the Departments and Ministries also participated in the event. 

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the new version of CPGRAMS will lead to reduction in grievance disposal time and improved quality of grievance redressal. The Minister also mentioned about the monthly “Pragati” (Pro Active Governance and Timely Implementation) review meetings where the Prime Minister himself reviews the status of public grievances. He mentioned about various other initiatives such as amendment in Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. He said that DARPG holds regular regional conferences and also the national e-Governance conferences. He further added though Grievance redressal mechanism existed in the past also, yet it was not as proactive and responsive as it is now. The mechanism has been institutionalised now with the number of grievances lodged increasing from 2 lakh earlier to about 16 lakhs now. This increase is due to the trust shown by people of the country in the grievance redressal mechanism of the Government, the Minister said. Dr Jitendra Singh said that the telephonic calls are made by the senior officers of the Department to the complainants to take their feedback about their satisfaction level. He said that the decision of the Government to post young IAS officers as Assistant Secretaries in the Central Ministries/departments for a period of 3 months has proved to be beneficial for the young recruits to understand the functioning the Government in the very beginning of their careers.

 

Speaking about the recent decision of the Government to amend Rule 54 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, the Minister said that this decision  shows the human angle of the Government and reflects its sensitivity towards the citizens. The Government has amended Rule 54 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 by a notification dated 20th September, 2019. As per the amended Rule, the family of a Government servant, who dies within seven years of joining service, will also be eligible for family pension at enhanced rate of 50% of last pay drawn, for a period of 10 years. The Minister said that this reform is one of the citizen-centric reforms in the first 100 days of Modi Government’s second term. He added that the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi is also approaching and this reform will be effective from 1st October which marks the eve of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary. 

 

The Secretary (DARPG & Pensions) Shri K. V. Eapen said that the decision to amend Rule 54 will benefit the people of the country, specially CAPFs with young deaths. Though simple, it is far-reaching reform, he added. He further said that Public Grievances are more of a feedback system to the Government to understand the root causes of the problems. He said that the Department has conducted a study by QCI to analyse the root cause of grievances in various ministries/departments. 

 

Delivering her inaugural address, Ms. Meera Handa said that making public service delivery system transparent has been the priority of the Government. She added that the public grievances mechanism is important for the departments with large public interface. Ms Handa added that keeping in mind the mammoth operations of the Department of Posts, some complaints are inevitable. She said till now top-down approach towards grievance redressal was followed and now with the new version of CPGRAMS, the complainant has been empowered. This will also save the processing time by about 7-10 days, she added. 

 

In his welcome address, Shri V. Srinivas, Additional Secrertary, DARPG said that the CPGRAMS reforms marks a major step of Government for systemic improvement in the CPGRAMS. The CPGRAMS 7.0 version is proposed to be replicated in the rest of the Central ministries in the coming months, he added. He said that currently the DARPG handles about 16 lakh grievances every year of which 95% are being disposed off satisfactorily. 

 

On the occasion, Shri Vishvapavan Pati, ADG, Department of Posts gave a detailed presentation where he said that the span has been widened in the new version of CPGRAMS with pin-pointed mapping of units. In new version 7.0, there are 540 subordinate units, against 67 units under 6.0 version. Under new version, there will be almost no manual intervention with mapping of 1.5 lakh post offices. Shri Sanjiv Narain Mathur, Joint Secretary (Pensions) also gave a detailed presentation about the amendment in Rule 54 of the CCS (Pensions) Rule, by giving a comparative view of old and new rule. 

 

Dr Jitendra Singh also inaugurated CPGRAMS 7.0 exhibition on the occasion. The exhibition displayed launch of revised version 7.0 of CPGRAMS by DARPG. The exhibition also contained exhibits from Department of Posts and Quality Council of India (QCI). The Department of Posts had displayed information related to launch of various stamps from time to time and their brief significance. DoP also displayed new initiatives of the Department and information related to launch of PG portal in DoP. The QCI had displayed brouchers related to the study undertaken by them in top 20 grievance receiving ministries and measures taken by them to streamline the disposal of grievances. 

 

The Government has taken a major step for systemic improvement in the Centralized Public Grievances Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS). The new upgraded version CPGRAMS 7.0 provides for greivances filed on CPGRAMS to be directly sent to field level grievance officers by providing user IDs to all field level functionaries. CPGRAMS Reforms has been a major thrust area for the Government and has been included in the 100 days agenda of the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances as also the Department of Posts. The Department of Posts is one of the largest recipients of Public Grievances in India. It is expected that the CPGRAMS 7.0 will cut processing time by 50 percent in the Department of Posts. 

 

The DARPG launched the CPGRAMS for receiving, redressing and monitoring of grievances from the public. The CPGRAMS provides the facility to lodge a grievance online from any geographical location. It enables the citizen to track online the grievance being followed up with Departments concerned and also enables DARPG to monitor the grievance. The citizen can then access the system through www.pgportal.nic.in. The DARPG has issued several guidelines for redress of public grievances by Departments to ensure the system is accessible, simple, quick, fair and responsive. These include designating a senior officer as Director of Grievances/Grievance officer in every office, deal with a grievance in a fair objective and just manner fixing the time limit for disposal of work relating to public grievances and staff grievances.

                On death of a Government servant while in service, the family is entitled to a family pension in accordance with Rule 54 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972. The family pension was payable at enhanced rate of 50% of the pay last drawn for a period of 10 years, if the Government servant had rendered a continuous service of not less than seven years; thereafter the rate of family pension was 30% of the pay last drawn. In case the Government servant had rendered a service of less than seven years before his death, the rate of family pension was 30% from the beginning and family pension at enhanced rate of 50% of last pay drawn was not payable to the family.

The Government felt that the need for family pension at enhanced rate is more in the case of a Government servant who dies early in his career, as his pay at the initial phase of service is much less. The Government has, therefore, amended Rule 54 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 by a notification dated 19th September, 2019. As per the amended Rule 54, the family of a Government servant, who dies within seven years of joining service, will also be eligible for family pension at enhanced rate of 50% of last pay drawn, for a period of 10 years. 

The above amendment would be effective from 1st October, 2019. However, the families of Government servants who died before completion of service of seven years within 10 years before 1st October, 2019, will also be eligible for family pension at enhanced rates with effect from 1st October, 2019.

The benefit of amended provisions would be available to the families of all Government servants, including the personnel of CAPFs, in the unfortunate event of their death within seven years of joining Government service.

                The MoS (PP) Dr Jitendra Singh said that the transition of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh to the UTs will be smooth and the cadre is no issue in this transition. He said that any arrangement or mechanism which evolves will be in the best interest of all the stakeholders. He was addressing at the Annual Conference of Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries (Personnel/GAD) of all State/UT Governments, organised by Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Government of India, here today.  The Secretary (DoPT), Dr. C. Chandramouli, Secretary (DARPG & Pensions) Shri K. V. Eapen and senior officers of the Centre and UT/State Governments were also present in the conference.

 

The Annual Conference aimed to deliberate upon the issues relating to personnel management of All India Service officers. The conference was organised to have a greater coordination between the States and the Central Government in the matters related to administration and governance. Various issues related to personnel management, training and other service matters related to All India Services were discussed during the conference. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has taken various initiatives to provide conducive working atmosphere to the officers with an aim to enable them to provide citizen-centric governance that is responsive to the needs and concerns of all stakeholders. He quoted examples of initiatives which included self-attestation, abolition of interviews for recruitment to non-gazetted posts, doing away with the obsolete rules and grievance redressal system, among others. The Minister said that the nature of PM’s Awards for Excellence has been entirely changed in the recent years. Now the civil servants are being rewarded for implementation of flagship programmes of the Government, with a large number of participation by the district collectors. 

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that Government has zero tolerance towards corruption and non-performance, but at the same time it is committed to provide conducive atmosphere to the honest and sincere officers. He added that the Prevention of Corruption Ac, 1988 has been amended by the Government recently so as to enable that no guilty is spared, while at the same time protecting the honest officers. He further said that the Government has made efforts for an inclusive administration demonstrated by the introduction of reservation of EWS category. He said that youth comprise of 70 percent of country's population and Government is committed to provide them all avenues of development. He spoke about the Government’s decision to post young IAS officers as Assistant Secretaries in the Central Ministries in order to provide them exposure about the functioning of the Government. This will enable them to implement the flagship schemes at the ground level, he added. There have been many out of box experiments and initiatives by the Government, the Minister said. 

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the modern technology has been put to maximum use by the Government. He said that Apps have been developed for Pensioners and filing RTI, etc. He also spoke about initiatives of Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare for the benefit of pensioners e.g. provision of minimum pension, organising Pension Adalats, pre-retirement counselling, among others. He further said that the retired employees are an asset for the nation and a mechanism should be developed to utilise their potential in the best possible manner. 

 

The Minister appealed that the spirit of Modi Government should reach to all states/UTs and they should emulate the best practices adopted by the Centre.  He said that such conferences help to provide a platform for deliberations to the States and Centre Government. The Minister added that we are an evolving democracy and mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure that rules are complied with.. He assured full cooperation and coordination from the Centre Government with State Governments and UTs for ensuring speedy and transparent administration to the people of the country. 

 

The DoPT Secretary, Dr C Chandramouli said that this conference has been organized to discuss issues of mutual interest to the Centre and State Governments. He said that both should be benefitted from each other’s experience. The purpose is to discuss and find solutions to issues related to All India Services, he added. The Secretary said that a scientific approach to cadre-management should be adopted for the benefit of all stakeholders.

                Brushing aside misinformation sought to be spread in certain quarters, Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh, who is also the MoS In-Charge Department of Personnel & Training (DOPT), which is the nodal department for Central Information Commission of India dealing with the Right to Information (RTI) appeals, said that RTI  can be filed locally in  the Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, even after the new arrangement comes into existence after the 31st of October, 2019. He denounced the mischievous rumours that, because J&K will become a Union Territory, the applicant will have to travel to Delhi to file an RTI.

Following a detailed discussion on the issue with Central Information Commissioner of India, Shri Sudhir Bhargava, Dr Jitendra Singh said certain vested elements continue to instigate different kinds of misgivings in the society, in a vain bid to  disrupt the courageous initiative by the Modi government. 

As a matter of fact, Dr Jitendra Singh said, during the last five years, after Shri Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister, the procedures to file an RTI appeal have been immensely simplified and definite timelines have been laid down. This will apply equally as much to Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh after these become Union territories, he said.  

Giving details, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the first RTI application is made to the Public Information Officer (PIO) locally and in  matters involving “life and liberty”, the time limit for the PIO to provide the information is 48 hours. For the PIO to reply to the application, timeline of 30 days has been laid down from the date of receipt of the application. For applicant to make first appeal after the receipt of PIO’s reply, the first Appellate authority  in the form of the designated officer will also be available locally, whether it is the State or Union territory. 

Only in case of second appeal, Dr Jitendra Singh elaborated, the application has to be submitted to the Information Commission and even if the Information Commissioner is not available locally, in case of Union territory, the second appeal can be sent to the Central Information Commission on-line within 90 days from the receipt of the first appeal orders or from the date the orders were to be received. 

To make the procedure much simpler, Dr Jitendra Singh said, we made use of the modern technology and in a major breakthrough, during the Modi government, provided the facility of making second appeal before the Central Information Commission through portal, which, in other words, means that an RTI applicant does not have to wait for the office hours and can file his appeal even from his mobile phone anytime during the day or night, at his convenience, and even while sitting at his home or anywhere else.

After the reorganization of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladaklh, Dr Jitendra Singh said, contrary to some of the unsubstantiated misgivings being spread, the citizens' participation will increase manifold and various provisions in public administration will become far more citizen-centric with the extension of uniformed central laws, as applicable in the rest of the country.

                The National Centre for Good Governance is conducting a Special Training Program for Maldivian Civil Servants and Bangladesh Civil Servants under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation program (ITEC) from September 16-28, 2019 at Mussoorie and Delhi. Shri K.V. Eapen, Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and Shri V. Srinivas, Additional Secretary, DARPG addressed  33 Maldivian Civil Servants and and 31 Bangladesh Civil Servants in a Joint Session on “Public Policy and Governance” at the National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG), Mussoorie. 

In the Chairman’s remarks, Shri K.V. Eapen said that India’s Governance model is witnessing a digital revolution and development has become a people’s movement to bring together innovation, technology, enterprise for efficient management of resources and successful implementation of priority programs. The emphasis has also been to provide clean and fair public administration. Further the universal implementation of Aadhar has enabled in reducing the digital divide. India has witnessed an expansion in internet access with high speed internet connectivity in many parts of the country that has enabled promotion of technology enabled interventions in health care, education, energy, next generation financial services and e-governance. There was similarity in the District Administrative set-ups in South Asia, with Bangladesh and Maldives having similar civil service career paths. He further added that the special training program offers a unique opportunity for exchange of information amongst Nation States of South Asia. 

As the lead speaker, Shri V.Srinivas, Additional Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances said that there has been a significant scaling up in implementation of priority sector programs, and the digital transformation in India’s governance is visible. India’s progress is best seen through 120 crore Aadhar cards, rising numbers of e-transactions since the launch of Digital India, Common Service Centres, Jan Dhan Accounts, 85 percent coverage in construction of toilets and above all the 2nd largest digital consumer base with the benefits of technology being accepted by rural societies. Technological progress is visible in all welfare state programs with direct benefits transfer schemes and digital payments using UPI and BHIM applications. The New India 2022 has focused on priority sector schemes of Swachh Bharat, Skill India, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Startup India and Make In India schemes. India has witnessed significant number of success stories in the campaign to transform India to a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. Further Shri V. Srinivas said that India adopted a zero tolerance approach to corruption, with strong institutional and legislative frameworks to fight corruption, preventive vigilance practices and stronger auditing and accounting practices. 

During discussions, the Civil Servants of Maldives and Bangladesh appreciated the progress made by India in the areas of digital governance. The Maldives and Bangladesh civil servants sought to understand India’s policies for interoperability of systems, norms regarding sharing of data, use of tele medicine facilities, stakeholder participation in rural development programs, use of robust data sets for decision making, politician-civil servant relationship and guidelines for grievance redressal. 

Following discussions, Mrs. Fatimath Amira, the Member of the Civil Services Commission of Maldives thanked the Indian authorities for the unique opportunity to understand the best practices of India’s governance model. 

The National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG), India’s leading civil services training institution, has been training Civil Servants from a number of countries in South Asia and Africa. Over the next 5 years, the NCGG will conduct trainings for 1800 civil servants of Bangladesh and 1000 civil servants of Maldives.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh chaired the 31st meeting of the Standing Committee of Voluntary Agencies (SCOVA), here today. The SCOVA meeting was organised by the Department of Pensions & Pensioners’ Welfare (DoP&PW), Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions.

During the meeting, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the SCOVA has gone a long way in addressing issues related to Pensioners in a focused manner. He said that today’s interaction was very meaningful and thus reflecting on the working of DoP&PW. 

Dr Jitendra Singh while listening the grievances of the pensioners assured them of timely redressal of their problems and said that Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is very much caring towards resolving the pensioners’ issues. He said that the Government is totally aware about the sensitivities related to the pensioners’  demands  and is bound to resolve them. 

The Minister also emphasized on maximum digitization of the documentation process dealing with pensioners’ cases. He said that the Department of Pensions has already digitalized the  process of providing the life certificate by pensioners and other documents. He said that we have started Pension Adalats through video conferencing and started the Pensioners’ Portal where one can easily check the PPO status, thus optimizing the use of technology for the welfare of the pensioners.  

While addressing the meeting, the Minister said that retired persons are an asset to the society and the country needs to evolve a mechanism to make good use of their knowledge, experience and efforts of the retired employees, which can help in the value addition to the current scenario. Dr. Jitendra Singh said the retired employees are a healthy and productive workforce for India and we need to streamline and channelize their energies in a productive direction.  He said that the retired person should do counseling for pensioners in his respective field of expertise. We should learn from the pensioners’ experience and the DoP&PW should be reoriented in such a way that pensioners become a part of nation building process.

On the demand of the SCOVA members, the Minister agreed to hold its meeting bi-annually instead of once a year. The Minister also directed for the prompt and time bound redressal of the grievances of the pensioners and said that we should have sympathetic attitude towards them.

In the meeting, discussions were held on the action taken report of the 30th SCOVA meeting. Further many issues related to pensioners were discussed threadbare, such as revision Health Insurance Scheme for pensioners including those residing in non-CGHS area, Extension of CGHS facilities to P&T pensioners etc. Out of the 31 cases came for redressal, 8 have been closed positively.

In his welcome address, Secretary, DoP&PW, Shri K.V. Eapen appreciated the sincerity and work done by the department towards mitigating the grievances of the pensioners and taking action on the 80 percent of issues raised in the 30th SCOVA meeting. He also mentioned about the huge attendance of pensioners during  the Pension Adalats conducted across the country. He said that interaction process between the Government Departments and Pensioners has increased manifold with the use of technology.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has gained high degree of credibility over the years and it has become a benchmark for investigation of crimes. He was speaking at the first National Conference on Cybercrime Investigation and Forensics, organized by the CBI, here today. The Minister congratulated the CBI for organizing the first national conference of its kind in the country. While complimenting the CBI, the Minister said that people from the most peripheral and remotest regions of the country trust the functioning of CBI. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that India is still evolving as a nation and organizations like CBI have helped to add credibility to the Indian democracy. He further said that the nature of crime also evolves with the evolution of society, which makes it essential on the part of investigative agencies to evolve their techniques. The entire crime scenario has changed over the years, he added. He emphasized that the study of cyber crime is important for India, keeping in mind the fact that India has a huge population and that India has the second largest internet users in the world.  

Speaking about the recent developments in the country, Dr Singh said that we are in the post-Article 370 abrogation scenario.  He expressed concern over the fact that the cyber manipulators are posing risk to the nation by circulating fake videos on the social media, which needs to be addressed. The Minister said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Government has given thrust to the optimum use of technology. He quoted examples of Digital India, GeM, Aadhar and Jandhan scheme. The computer technology has entered a large number of household of India, he added. He added that the second thrust of the Government has been on our clarity in fight against terrorism and decisive actions have been taken in this regard. 

The Minister announced that a Centralised Technology Vertical (CTV) with a cost of  Rs 99 crore will be set up within CBI, which will be operational by next year. It will help in getting real time information for the benefit of interrogators, he added. The Minister said that tackling cyber crime cannot be left to CBI alone. He emphasized on the role of NGOs and activists to join this crusade to counter cybercrime by changing the mindset of masses. 

The Director, CBI, Shri R K Shukla said that this conference is a platform for State Police and Enforcement agencies to share their best practices and to replicate them. He said that cyber crime has become a global phenomena now and this conference will be an enriching experience for the agencies working at grass root levels. 

The two-day conference was inaugurated by the Director, CBI yesterday. Around 50 Officers including DGPs, ADGPs, IGPs, DIGPs and SPs dealing with cybercrime in State & UT Police, Central Agencies, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, other Ministries, experts from Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and academia participated in the Conference. During the conference, several lectures, presentations and panel discussions on various topics/themes of law enforcement interest, including, Mobile/Digital Forensics, Inter-LEA information/ intelligence exchange, obtaining digital evidence from abroad, online harming including child sexual abuse, Social Media, establishing standard formats for data exchange between service providers and LEAs, Intermediary liability, Admissibility of Electronic Evidence were discussed in the deliberations.

                Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG), its attached offices, and Oil & Gas CPSEs, under the administrative control of MoPNG, celebrated Swachhta Pakhwada fortnight with full zeal and enthusiasm. 

Our Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2nd October, 2014 in his vision for a clean and green India. To accelerate efforts to implement his vision, so that it is ingrained in everyone’s DNA, Swachhata Pakhwada was started in April 2016, with the objective of bringing a fortnight of intense focus on the activities and practices of Swachhta by engaging Ministries, Departments & other Offices. 

During Swachhta Pakhwada from 01st July 2019 – 15th July, 2019, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel inaugurated a renovated and greener Gate No. 4 at Shastri Bhawan, the building housing the main ministry in New Delhi. The Ministry held a special workshop on the theme “Waste segregation and Re-use of waste for creating useful things from it”. Ministry also organized essay writing and painting competition for creating swachhta awareness, the awards for which were given by Secretary(PNG).

On 16th September 2019, Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Steel, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan distributed the Awards to all the winners of the Swachhta Pakhwada 2019, and also to the winners of Inter-refinery Swachhta Ranking 2018-19. To engender healthy competition, Swachhta ranking of Oil & Gas CPSEs/ attached offices was undertaken, based on their performance in Swachhta Pakhwada, rankings were finalized by a Committee. BPCL emerged as the winner; ONGC stood second and IOCL came third. Additionally, the attached office PPAC has been adjudged in the highly recommended category. In Swachhta Inter-Refinery rankings of Oil & Gas CPSEs/JVs, Mumbai Refinery of BPCL stood first, Panipat Refinery of IOCL and Bathinda Refinery of HMEL jointly stood second, and Bina Refinery of BORL came third.  

A glimpse of the important initiatives/activities carried out by Ministry of P&NG, attached offices & its Oil & Gas CPSEs, focusing on the theme during Swachhta Pakhwada are as under:


	     IOCL undertook cleaning of 37 water bodies across India, in locations such as Lunava Village (Rajasthan), Ramdhan Park Pond (Kolkata, West Bengal), BinduSagar Lake (Bhubaneswar, Odisha), etc, where the intensive cleaning of water bodies and their banks were undertaken. IOCL also installed a reverse plastic vending machine at Chennai.
	ONGC undertook a Clean Himalaya Campaign where they collected 20 bags of garbage from Kedarnath Dham & 253 bags of garbage from Tungnath, Chopta, Deoriatal area.
	BPCL undertook various activities where Cleaning of Ganga Ghat, Varanasi and more than 1200 Kgs of waste was removed and sent to Nagar Nigam for further processing. To promote the message of the Swachhta, BPCL distributed more than 6,00,000 LPG Cylinders with the message of ‘Let’s make the dream of clean India a reality’ in Hindi and English.
	Renowned sports persons who are part of various Oil & Gas CPSEs, were also enthusiastically engaged in spreading the message of Swachhta.


As a result of this initiative led by MoPNG, there were more than 60,000 activities undertaken across India and more than 200,000 trees were planted.

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan met Mr. Igor Sechin, Chairman of the Management Board and CEO, Rosneft and Former Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation today in New Delhi. This visit is aimed at furthering discussions between Rosneft and Indian oil & gas companies. This visit also follows the visit of Hon’ble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi to Vladivostok as the Chief Guest at the Eastern Economic Forum, and the 20th Annual Bilateral Summit betweenPrime Minister Modi andPresident of Russia H.E. Mr. Vladimir Putin.

It may be recalled that India and Russia issued a Joint Statement  on Cooperation in Hydrocarbon Sector for 2019-24 during the visit of Hon’ble Prime Minister of India to Russia earlier this month.

During the meeting of Minister Pradhan with CEO, Rosneft, a detailed review of the ongoing cooperation between Indian oil & gas PSUs with Rosneft was undertaken. The developments in energy markets, including global crude oil supplies, in the light of  the recent attacks on Saudi Aramco’s facilities, was also discussed. In this context, aspecial focus was on increase of crude oil supplies from Russia to Indian refineries.

The ongoing joint projects in Russia between Indian oil & gas PSUs and Rosneft were also reviewed, specifically Sakhalin-1, Taas-Yuryakhand Vankor fields. In the presence of Minister Pradhan, the Indian Consortium of four oil & gas PSUs (BPRL, IOCL,OVL and OIL) and Rosneft today exchanged a non-binding cooperation agreement,  reiterating their interest in participation of the Indian companies in the Eastern Cluster project of Russia.

Another area of discussion was the plan of the consortium of foreign investors, including Rosneft, for the further development of Nayara Energy. The consortium is reviewing an option of a two-fold increase of the refining throughput at the Vadinar Refinery. The first stage consortium commits to investment of USD 850 million towards the building of a petrochemical unit in Vadinar within two years. The consortium is also planning to expand Nayara Energy’s retail presence, which currently has over 5300 retail outlets across the country.

CEO, Rosneft indicated the company’s readiness to intensify their cooperation, aimed at the strengthening of energy security in India and in supplying of high-quality feedstock and crude oil to India. Shri Pradhan indicated that further consultations on taxation matters need to be undertaken with Ministry of Finance.

Minister Pradhan recalled that Rosneft is the most important partner of Indian oil & gas companies, with mutually beneficial investment relations both in India and Russia. He welcomed the initiative of Rosneft to increase their investments at their Vadinar refinery, and also assured of support from the Government in facilitating their investments. He also welcomed the ongoing discussions between Indian OMCs and Rosneft to finalize a term-contract for supply of Russian crude oil to India, and mentioned that this is part of India’s efforts to diversify its sources of crude oil.

The meeting focussed on bilateral energy cooperation and the establishment of an efficient energy bridge based on the vertical integration concept. This includes participation of the Indian and Russian oil & gas companies in production projects, and investments in refining as well as the joint operations on the global and regional markets.

                Contract signing award ceremony for Coal gasification unit for production of Urea and Ammonia at Talcher fertilizer plant was held in New Delhi today. Rs 13,277 crore plant in the Angul district, Odisha, being promoted by GAIL, RCF, CIL and FCIL, will produce 1.27 MMTPA Urea and 0.73 MMTPA Ammonia. The coal gasification technology for the plant will be provided by M/s Wuhan Engineering Co Ltd.

 



 

Speaking on the occasion, the Petroleum and Natural gas & Steel Minister Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said that Talcher fertilizer plant will produce Urea and Ammonia based on coal gasification technology that will create a new benchmark in India's development journey. He said ""India is fully committed to COP21 to bring down its carbon footprint, and use of coal gasification technology is a step in this direction"". Adding on, he said that the Government has decided to revive all closed fertilizer plants in eastern India. Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga for eastern gas grid is progressing at good speed, with Gorakhpur and Barauni being already covered, and Sindari to be covered soon. He said that the project shall use a blend of coal and petcoke as feedstock for production of Fertilizer. Coal for this project shall be sourced from captive Northern part of North Arkhapal mine in Talcher region allotted to TFL and work for development of captive mine is already under progress. Petcoke shall be sourced from Paradip refinery for the project. This project shall promote use of abundantly available domestic coal in an environment friendly manner. Shri Pradhan said that success of this technology shall also propel usage of coal for production of other products like, syngas, diesel, methanol, petrochemicals etc. The Minister said that this project has the potential to be a game changer in Indian context due to the harnessing of Coal through cleaner technologies in sectors other than power and shall produce 2.38 MMSCMD of Natural Gas equivalent Syngas leading to direct reduction in LNG import bill.  

 



 

In his address, the Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda said that for meeting the food requirements of the country, the role of fertilizers especially Urea in Indian context is paramount. Currently, India imports about 50 to 70 lakh tones of Urea every year to meet the urea requirement. He said that Govt of India is putting its earnest efforts to augment the availability of domestically produced urea. Currently production of urea in the country is done by using pooled natural gas which comprises of domestic NG and imported LNG. Import of LNG is a costly affair and leads to spending valuable foreign exchange. Hence it is preferred that an indigenous raw material is used for production of urea and other fertilizers in the country. He said that Talcher Fertilizer Project is a step in this direction wherein indigenous coal in a mix of petcoke shall be used for production of urea. The project shall improve India's self-sufficiency in Urea, promote agriculture growth in Odisha and increase reliability of Urea availability to farmers of Odisha in particular and India in general. Shri Gowda said that this initiative would propel India towards self-reliance in the Urea sector through efforts under ""Make in India"", in addition to generating direct and indirect employment of about 4,500.

                Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has said that the inevitable shift in global energy consumption to Asia is a reality. Addressing the opening session of the 8th Asian Ministerial Energy Roundtable in Abu Dhabi today, he said that we now need to ensure that this change is rooted in Energy Justice, which was articulated by Prime Minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi as most important component of Energy Vision of India.  

.

Shri Pradhan said that the Emerging Asia will be driving the world economic growth in the coming 20 years. In the global context, developing economies will drive 80% of the incremental global growth, with India and China accounting for more than half of it.  He said “Energy access, higher standard of living and improved prosperity in developing countries will primarily drive the energy demand. It is important for the low income, low per capital energy consuming countries to have access to technology and capital when it comes to energy efficiency and cleantech. That will provide better energy security than short term interventions in fossil fuel supply and price.” He said that due to poor and imbalanced energy infrastructure, 400 million people in Asian region have no access to electricity, and rural residents have no access to clean electricity. Therefore, providing safe, stable, affordable and efficient energy has become an important task for governments of all countries.

Describing the Energy Vision of India, Sh Pradhan said that it has been enunciated by Prime Minister Modi in 2016, and is based on four pillars i.e. energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security. “As part of our integrated approach towards energy planning during the last five years, India is placing enormous emphasis on energy access with energy justice as a key objective in itself.”, he added. The Minister added that India has undertaken a number of path-breaking policies and initiatives during the last 5 years to realize energy justice for over 1.3 billion people in the country.   

 

Later, addressing the session on ‘Advancing Inclusive Access to Secure, Affordable, and Sustainable Energy Services’ in the event, Shri Pradhan  said “In India, we have to improve availability of energy to over 1.3 billion people, whose per capita energy consumption is lower than the global average. Now, India is the third-largest energy consumer in the world, and its energy demand is growing faster than all major economies of the world. Our share of total global primary energy demand is set to double to 11% by 2040. We are preparing for such a growth path of energy demand in the country. This calls for making matching investments in the energy sector.”

Shri Pradhan said “As part of our integrated approach towards energy planning, energy justice will be a key objective in itself. In this context, we are working towards the early realization of the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7. A number of transformative policies and initiatives have been taken in India to realize the above objectives. We are significantly expanding our energy infrastructure – be it power generation, more renewables and gas-based infrastructure -pipelines, city gas network, LNG terminals. We launched a major campaign to improve access to clean cooking fuel under the Ujjwala Yojana scheme three years back, and Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi handed over the 80 millionth LPG connection couple of days back. A ‘Blue Flame Revolution’ is underway. LPG coverage has reached more than ninety percent from fifty-five percent five years ago. India attained universal electrification all villages. This year, India aims to achieve hundred per cent electrification of households, through SAUBHAGYA. Clean transportation is another area of high priority in India. We are jumping directly from BS-VI to BS-VI fuel by April 2020. India is moving towards a gas-based economy by increasing the share of gas from 6% to 15% in the energy mix by 2030. We have constructed over 16,000 km of gas pipeline and an additional 11,000 km is under construction. We have covered over four hundred districts and 70 percent of our population. There is already a cardinal shift to renewable energy sources. Our target is 175 GW by 2022, with solar target of 100 GW by 2022. We are promoting alternative fuels like ethanol and bio-diesel in a big way. A National Bio-Fuel Policy 2018 was unveiled, targeting 20% blending of ethanol in petrol and 5% blending of bio-diesel in diesel by 2030.” He informed the gathering that India joined the elite group of nations in August 2018 to operate a flight running on biofuel. 

On the sidelines of the 8th Asian Ministerial Energy Roundtable in Abu Dhabi, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan also held a series of bilateral discussions with leaders from other countries. He met his UAE counterpart Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Industry.

Government of India launched Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) to provide 8 crore deposit free LPG connections to poor households in the country.  Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched PMUY on 1.5.2016 from Ballia, Uttar Pradesh, by handing over the first connection to the beneficiary.  The Scheme aims to provide clean cooking fuel to poor households and replace the unhealthy conventional cooking fuels such as firewood, cowdung, etc. The use of LPG has its benefits on the health of women and children, environment and economic productivity of women.

 

Three State owned Oil Marketing Companies i.e. IOCL, BPCL and HPCL have implemented the Scheme in all the States/UTs of the country in a mission mode and achieved the target of 8 crore connections, seven months ahead of the timelines set (March 2020).

 

The States of Uttar Pradesh (1.46 crore), West Bengal (88 lakh), Bihar (85 lakh), Madhya Pradesh (71 lakh) and Rajasthan (63 lakh) have topped the list with highest number of beneficiaries under the PMUY. Nearly 40% of the beneficiaries belong to SC/ST categories. The implementation of PMUY has earned domestic as well as global appreciation at various Forums.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for the following, including fixing higher ethanol price derived from different raw materials under the EBP Programme for the forthcoming sugar season 2019-20 during ethanol supply year from 1st December 2019 to 30th November 2020: 

 

(i)         The price of ethanol from C heavy molasses route be increased from Rs.43.46 per lit to Rs.43.75 per litre, 

(ii)        The price of ethanol from B heavy molasses route be increased from Rs.52.43 per lit to Rs.54.27 per litre, 

(iii)       The price of ethanol from sugarcane juice/sugar/sugar syrup route be fixed at Rs.59.48 per litre, 

(iv)       Additionally, GST and transportation charges will also be payable. OMCs have been advised to fix realistic transportation charges so that long distance transportation of ethanol is not disincentivised,

(v)        OMCs are advised to continue according priority of ethanol from 1) sugarcane juice/sugar/sugar syrup, 2) B heavy molasses 3) C heavy molasses and 4) Damaged Food grains/other sources, in that order,

 

All distilleries will be able to take benefit of the scheme and large number of them are expected to supply ethanol for the EBP programme. Remunerative price to ethanol suppliers will help in reduction of cane farmer’s arrears, in the process contributing to minimizing difficulty of sugarcane farmers. 

Ethanol availability for EBP Programme is expected to increase significantly due to higher price being offered for procurement of ethanol from all the sugarcane based routes, subsuming “partial sugarcane juice route” and “100% sugarcane juice route” under “sugarcane juice route” and for the first time allowing sugar and sugar syrup for ethanol production. Increased ethanol blending in petrol has many benefits including reduction in import dependency, support to agricultural sector, more environmental friendly fuel, lesser pollution and additional income to farmers.

 

Background:

Government has been implementing Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme wherein OMCs sell petrol blended with ethanol up to 10%. This programme has been extended to whole of India except Union Territories of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands with effect from 01st April, 2019 to promote the use of alternative and environment friendly fuels. This intervention also seeks to reduce import dependence for energy requirements and give boost to agriculture sector.

Government has notified administered price of ethanol since 2014. For the first time during 2018, differential price of ethanol based on raw material utilized for ethanol production was announced by the Government. These decisions have significantly improved the supply of ethanol thereby ethanol procurement by Public Sector OMCs has increased from 38 crore litre in ethanol supply year 2013-14 to estimated over 200 crore litre in 2018-19.

Consistent surplus of sugar production is depressing sugar price. Consequently, sugarcane farmer’s dues have increased due to lower capability of sugar industry to pay the farmers. Government has taken many decisions for reduction of cane farmer’s dues.

With a view to limit sugar production in the Country and to increase domestic production of ethanol, Government has taken multiple steps including, allowing diversion of B heavy molasses and sugarcane juice for ethanol production. As the ex-mill price of sugar and conversion cost have undergone changes, there is a need to revise the ex-mill price of ethanol derived from different sugarcane based raw materials. There is also a demand from the industry to include sugar and sugar syrup for ethanol production to help in solving the problem of inventory and liquidity with the sugar mills.

Making efforts towards energy conservation and taking appropriate measures to mitigate carbon emissions is our key priority”, said the Minister. He also added that, “Energy efficiency measures would reduce MSMEs’ power bills and make them competitive in international market.” The Minister further said that the Government is committed to the development of MSMEs with an objective to transform the sector through green and sustainable initiatives towards high growth.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri R K Singh said that “Industrial energy demand in India has almost doubled in the last five years and it is expected to go up by over three times between 2012 and 2040. Therefore, adopting energy efficiency Initiatives and following best practices in this regard would be helpful in reducing the energy demand and strengthening energy security” 

The Minister further said that upcoming New Tariff Policy proposes DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) method for transfer of power subsidies and this would incentivize energy saving by consumers. He also stressed upon the need to make electricity prices rational for MSMEs. Towards this end, the New Tariff Policy provides a trajectory to reduce cross subsidies, he said. The Policy also has provision for providing open access in a time bound manner, the Minister told. ‘Your (MSMEs) energy consumption is huge, so the potential for savings is also huge. This potential need to be tapped’, said the Power Minister stressing that ‘We have to give a better world and cleaner environment to our future generations’.

Development Commissioner (MSME) stated that Indian MSME base is one of the largest in the world, after China. Apart from being instrumental in economic development and large scale employment provider, the sector holds its strength for on-demand manufacturing service, responsiveness to innovations, quick adoptions to changes and well established value added supply chain. He also credited Indian MSME sector with a pride in supporting ISRO for Chandrayaan 2, an ambitious space program of India. The space agency has already demonstrated partnering with MSMEs, sourcing quality component and services to support indigenous space programs/missions”.

The Ministers also released Energy Conservation Guidelines for MSMEs and launched the Knowledge Management Portal “SIDHIEE” under the BEE’s MSME Programme. This portal will host useful information including fifty videos of multimedia tutorials for MSMEs for early adoption of energy efficient technologies. 

During the inaugural session, an MoU for enhancing energy security in MSMEs was also signed between the Development Commissioner, MSME and DG,Bureau of Energy Efficiency for developing a long term roadmap for enhancing energy efficiency and security for the MSME Sector through focused intervention.

                An international conference ANGAN (Augmenting Nature by Green Affordable New-habitat) focussed on Energy Efficiency in Building Sector began here today. The Conference is being organised by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), Ministry of Power, Government of India in collaboration with GIZ under the Indo German Technical Cooperation.Shri Raj Pal, Economic Advisor, Ministry of Power and Shri Abhay Bakre, DG, BEE inaugurated the Conference in the presence of eminent experts in the field.

Speakers, Delegates, Experts and Policy Makers across 16 countries are participating in this three-day event. The participants from Central and State local authorities as well as Technology providers and Experts, practicing Architects and University Students have also been invited.The Experts will be discussing various alternative options and technologies in the field of design and construction of energy efficient Commercial as well as Residential Buildings and will suggest the effective ways in implementing the same through policies and programmes.  It is estimated that an investment of Rs. 2000 billion in Building energy efficiency activities would lead to a cumulative savings of 388 Billion units of electricity for the next ten years with payback of about 2 years. 

Eminent speakers and dignitaries like Dr Ajay Mathur (Director General, The Energy and Research Institute), Mr SonamWangchuk (Founder- Director, SELCMOL), Prof.Deo Prasad (CI & CEO CRCLCL, Sydney) and others from different parts of the world, gathered to debate, discuss and deliberate on the aspects of sustainability in the context of inclusiveness, international cooperation and education. Stakeholders from the energy efficiency sector also showcased technologies in the area of insulation, AAC block, Glass window, Fenestration shooting etc. for energy efficiency in buildings through many parallel sessions were also organised on 18 thematic tracks as part of agenda of ANGAN event.



The International Conference will provide a platform to deliberate on interdependence between organizations, systemic sustainability and feedback loops for better resource efficiency. Given the formidable challenge of providing adequate energy of desired quality to the consumers at reasonable costs, improving the efficiency in high energy consumption sectors like buildings have become important component of our integrated energy policy. Due to lack of awareness and knowledge about latest technologies, financial assistance, suppliers and purchase of energy efficient equipment, etc. efforts on energy efficiency and conservation in this sector have been moderate and therefore require greater push. This event aims to provide thrust in this direction so as to address such challenges faced by the stakeholders.

As part of this event, an exhibition on Energy Efficient Building Material Suppliers, Technology suppliers, Research Institutions and Universities displayed latest things in the Building Energy Efficiency Sector is also displayed. The Delegates will have opportunities to interact with building experts and policy makers and understand the economically viable options in the construction of Commercial Buildings as well as Residential Building Sector. Apart from energy savings, the emphasis is also given to other resources like water and other materials that can be saved in Building sector.

                A Pilot Project for ushering in 'Industry 4.0' in the country, is launched for implementation at the Modern Coach Factory (MCF), Raebareli. The Ministry of Railways and Department of Science & Technology have joined hands in partnership with IIT Kanpur for taking up a unique project on ‘Industry 4.0’ by launching a Pilot Project for implementation at Modern Coach Factory, Raebareli. 

 

The launch ceremony saw exchange of Ideas between Railway Board (Member Rolling Stock), Shri Rajesh Agrawal, Secretary Department of Science & Technology Shri Ashutosh Sharma, Professor N.S.Vyas of IIT Kanpur, DG RDSO Shri Virendra Kumar, General Manager MCF Shri V.M. Srivatsava some other senior Officials of the Railway Board and the Ministry of HRD. 

 

Speaking on the occasion Secretary Department of Science & Technology Shri Ashutosh Sharma said that his department has recently launched a new programme “Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS)” to foster and promote R&D in this emerging field of research. He said about 4000 crore rupees are expected to be spent in years to come in this area. Railway Board (Member Rolling Stock), Shri Rajesh Agrawal, said that today's initiative is expected to make India an advanced Industrial economy with exponential growth in jobs.

 

‘Industry 4.0’ commonly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, is a name given to the current trend of automation, interconnectivity and data exchange in manufacturing technologies to increase productivity. Industry 4.0 is a complex Cyber-Physical Systems which synergizes production with digital technologies, the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data & Analytics, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. 

 

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in his address in Houston, USA on 22nd Sept’ 2019 had highlighted the importance of ‘Industry 4.0’ in global economy and India's advantage. 

 

The project launched today would be undertaken under the aegis of “Technology Mission for Indian Railways” (TMIR). It would be implemented by a consortium of Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Science & Technology on an investment sharing model for taking up identified railway projects for applied research and use on Indian Railways for advancement and modernization.  

 

Industry 4.0 is a complex cyber/physical digital system. Therefore, the architecture to be conceptualized and formulated in MCF initially would be gradually expanded in a phased manner to encompass all complexities that constitute Industry 4.0 in all manufacturing spheres in the country.  

 

Full transition to the digital factory using ‘Industry 4.0’ across entire value chain from design to production will help enhance productivity hugely by providing insight into production process to take the decisions in real time basis, minimizing human errors by effective monitoring to ensure that resources are put to the best utilization measured by, what is called the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). 

 

Such a National Policy for Advanced Manufacturing envisages that manufacturing sector should contribute at least 25% to GDP.  All over the world, countries who have been able to achieve phenomenal growth, could do that with the advent of rapid strides in manufacturing sector. This initiative in Railways may have wider ramifications to spur growth in defence production as well as in private manufacturing sector also.  

Modern Coach Factory (MCF), Raebareli was established as a State of the Art coach manufacturing unit with the capacity to manufacture 1000 passenger coaches annually and has modern automated machines and robotic fabrication lines. During last one year, MCF has increased its production phenomenally to 1425 LHB coaches in 2018-19 vis-à-vis 710 LHB coaches in 2017-18. This was enabled significantly by the adoption of elements of Industry 4.0. on sophisticated machines. Inspection of MCF by the Prime Minister in December 2018 has been an inspiration to proliferate this initiative. 

In view of the continuous demand for higher speed coaches with comfort of international level and to meet the demand of a continuously growing economy, there is a need to employ the tools which will improve the productivity to next higher level with greater product flexibility. 

Industry 4.0 would be based cyber/physical digital system and would involve various packages, systems, applications and Hardware within Design/Planning, Networking and Production to be added in a modular and incremental manner in MCF

Various shops under the ambit of Industry 4.0, areas such as Inspection, Machining, Welding, Measurement etc., will also be provided with the initial & Bigdata Analytics, Artificial-Intelligence etc.

                Railway Recruitment Control Board, Ministry of Railways, held a presentation session with major Examination Conducting Agencies (ECA) to assess their strength and potential to hold large recruitment examinations for Indian Railways.

Indian Railways being the largest employer of manpower, has given over 1.5 lakh employment and almost equal number is in the pipeline. Railway Examinations invite a large number of applications running into lakhs and more. Last year, one of the examinations had about 1.89 crore candidates which is a record.

Conducting such large scale examinations successfully has been a matter of concern and, hence, Examination Conducting Agencies are selected after minutely scrutinising their credentials and potentials. To broad base the choice of Agencies, Indian Railways held a presentation session with Examination Conducting Agencies for which notification was issued a week back. Agencies from all over India participated. The presentation was followed by interactive session with Chairmen of Railway Recruitment Boards who were also present during the session. Based on the interactions, the Railways is expected to float tender for selecting the Examination Conducting Agency for holding the forth-coming examinations of Non-Technical Popular Categories and Miscellaneous Categories, to be held in the coming months.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the payment of Productivity Linked Bonus (PLB) equivalent to 78 days wages to over 11.52 Lakh eligible non-gazetted railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) for the Financial Year (FY) 2018-19, for maintaining industrial peace and motivation of railwaymen. This entails an expenditure of Rs. 2024.40 crores to the exchequer.

This is the sixth consecutive year that the Government led by Mr Narendra Modi has maintained a bonus of 78 days wages. It has never lowered it.



Benefits:

Payment of PLB equivalent to 78 days wages to eligible railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) for the FY 2018-19 would result in motivating a large number of railway employees to improve the performance of the Railways and enhance the productivity levels further, besides maintaining industrial peace.

PLB to all non-gazetted railway employees is an acknowledgement of their contribution to the efficient running of the Railways.

There being large number of railwaymen and their families, this acknowledgement will enhance the sense of inclusiveness and equity among them.

                The way ACs run and power supply is done in railway coaches is to transform. Such new technological transformation is also to bring in foreign exchange saving of about 1400 Crore Rupees per year.

 

In the new technology called - Head on Generation technology, the power will be drawn from the Overhead Electric supply. The power generator cars which used to make huge noise and emit fumes will no more be there. In place of two such generator cars there will be one standby silent generator car to be used for emergency. In place of the other car, there will be LSLRD (LHB Second Luggage, Guard & Divyaang Compartment). This LSLRD will also have capability to convert power from the overhead supply to be utilised in the entire train while providing space for luggage guard room and additional passengers. Currently, the cost of power is over Rs. 36 per unit and with HOG it will available at Rs. 6 Per unit.

 

Giving these details, Member, Rolling Stock, Shri Rajesh Agarwal said that it is planned to convert  all LHB trains to HOG system within this year. Till date 342 trains have already been converted into HOG.  This is resulting in saving of approximate Rs 800 crore per year now. 284 more trains are to be converted into HOG by the year end to be resulting in more savings.  In the year 2017, decision has been taken for complete switch over to LHB technology. After this decision, adoption of HOG conversion has been taken in mission mode to complete this work in time bound manner. The work involved modification in electrical system of power cars and coaches: All new coaches from Production Units are to be HOG compliant. The conversion work has been allotted to Zonal Railways and with the dedicated efforts of field officers; This will provide noise free and pollution environment for passenger at station.

Brief about Head on Generation system:

Head on Generation system is electrical power supply system where electrical power for catering hotel  load of train, which includes Train Lighting, Air conditioning, Lighting, fannage and other passenger interface requirement working on electrical power supply. This scheme is widely used power supply system by Railways world over. The power in this system is received from locomotive. With introduction of this scheme heavy underslung power generating equipment gets eliminated. Further it also reduces use of Diesel sets employed in power cars in End on Generation system. 

In the year 1996, Indian railways entered into ToT agreement with Linke Hofmann Busch Germany.  The LHB coaches have been designed to run on End on Generation system with two power cars employing two DG sets on either end.  

During the period from 2000 to 2017, both LHB and ICF coaches used to be manufactured in Railway Production Units. LHB coaches continued to be manufactured with EOG power supply system employing two power cars at either end. Whereas ICF coaches with self generating technology employing belt driven alternators in bogies continued to be manufactured. 

Cost of electricity generation from DG set and in self generating coaches is very high resulting into increase in diesel consumption and substantial operating expenditure

                Indian Railways will undertake one more drive of “MASSIVE SHRAMDAN“ with main focus on “COLLECTION OF PLASTIC WASTE”. This is to be done on this Tuesday, the 17th September, 2019. In the recent past such drives are being undertaken by Railways. This Shramadan is for:-


	Enhanced cleanliness, through collection of plastic waste from all railway premises. Particular attention to be given to approaches to stations
	Creating awareness for a greater impact against single use plastic. 
	Displaying Replacements/ Substitutes for such plastic items. 
	For distributing Cloth bags in large numbers as advised by the Environment and Housekeeping Management Division of Railways through its letter dated 12.9.2019.
	Educating all in Railways, including vendors to be prepared for ban of single use plastic with effect from 02.10.2019. Single use plastic means usage of any plastic below 50 microns, in any manner.


The Prime Minister had specially desired that Indian Railways should lead this initiative. Accordingly the Minister for Railways had directed a 10 days cleanliness drive earlier for trains and stations starting 2nd September, 2019. The Minister had been monitoring photos relating to several such drives being uploaded on E-Drishti and other dashboards. He had been encouraging those Railway Divisions performing well on Swachhata too. Indian Railways due to such serious efforts, to make cleanliness its work culture, had won the Best Union Ministry Swachhata award for 2018-19 presented by the President of India on the last Friday-6th September, 2019.

Further, Indian Railways is undertaking various activities relating to Swachhata Pakhwada from 11th September to 2nd October, 2019, leading to Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary on that Day, which would be observed as Community Service day, involving participation of all stake holders, to make a visible impact on cleanliness. The Chairman Railway Board had also continuously been in touch with all Divisional heads to emphasize on the subject. He has asked all Divisional Heads to provide plastic bottle crushing machines, at over four thousand- A1 & A2 stations by the 2nd October, 2019.

Meanwhile, the Railway Board has also sent a letter to all Divisional Heads, directing that this MASSIVE SHRAMADAN on the 17th September, 2019 should be arranged at each and every station and nearby localities, approaches to the stations, and in areas near tracks all over the country. Senior most officials at the stations and at all other levels of Indian Railways are asked to lead the SHRAMDAAN- involving participation of all railway employees, their families, railway pensioners, and all other stakeholders and self help groups.  Charitable organizations are also to be requested to participate in the drive. Trade unions may also be actively involved, to make it a success. A report, including photographs, is asked to be submitted to the Environment and Housekeeping Management Division of Railways.

            A competition on Plastic Waste Management at Railway station is to be launched at the Divisional level followed by General Manager’s level. Best Zone / Division will be assessed by Railway Board based on the report submitted by Zones / Divisions.

                In a significant passenger-friendly move, Ministry of Railways has decided to rationalize the fare structure and composition of Humsafar class of trains making them more affordable and comfortable. It will be a big relief to the Indian Railway passengers who can now enjoy the modern facilities of Humsafar trains at lower rates.

Firstly, the existing variable fare system of the Humsafar class of trains has been done away with which means these trains will now have only ‘fixed’ fare system. 

Secondly, the base fare of Humsafar trains will be 1.15 times of the base fare of Mail/Express Trains and not “Superfast” Mail/Express Trains which will lead to reduction in the Humsafar base fare. 

Thirdly, the Tatkal charges in Humsafar have also been reduced from existing 1.5 times of Humsafar base fare to approximately 1.3 times of Humsafar base fare. These Tatkal charges will be subject to maximum and minimum limit like normal Tatkal rule. This means that Tatkal fare in Humsafar trains has been brought equivalent to the Normal Tatkal Rule of other Mail/Express trains (Humsafar base fare + Normal Class wise Tatkal charges). 

Fourthly, Sleeper class coaches will also be attached in addition to existing only 3AC class coaches as per the requirement and as per the decision of the Zonal Railways.  

Fifthly, tickets under current booking after the first charting shall be sold with 10% discount on the applicable basic fare and other supplementary charges like all other trains.

The revised fare structure shall be implemented w.e.f Advance Reservation Period/No booking date after making required changes in PRS system.

The attachment of the sleeper class coaches has already been started w.e.f today i.e. 13th September, 2019. Four Sleeper class coaches have already been attached in Anand Vihar-Allahabad Humsafar Express today i.e. 13th September, 2019. 

Other charges like reservation fee, superfast surcharge, GST etc., as applicable shall be levied separately. Catering shall be optional.

Vacant berths left after first charting would be offered for current booking. Tickets under current booking shall be sold with 10% discount on the applicable basic fare and other supplementary charges like reservation fee, superfast charges, GST etc., as applicable shall be levied in full.

The advance reservation period (ARP) shall be 120 days.

Issue of tickets on warrants shall be allowed.

Normal cancellation and refund rule shall apply.

                Indian Railways have undertaken some major Green initiatives as part of India’s contribution towards mitigation of global warming and combating climate change. To carry forward this green initiative, an MoU was signed between Ministry of Railways and Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) for facilitation of green initiatives in Indian Railways at New Delhi today in the presence of the  Minister of State of Railways, Shri Suresh C. Angadi, Director General of CII Shri Chandrajit Banerjee, Member, Rolling Stock, Shri Rajesh Agarwal and other Railway Board Officials.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State of Railways, Shri Suresh C. Angadi said that Cleanliness (Swachhta) has become a movement. Taking inspiration from the Prime Minister, mass participation is now being witnessed across the country on this front. In Railways also, concerted efforts are being made to ensure cleanliness and hygiene in trains and on station premises. He appreciated Railway officials and staff for their effort in this direction. He expressed his happiness that 50 Railway units including workshops and production units, 12 Railway stations and 16 more buildings and other facilities have achieved Green Certification. He hoped that more Railway Production Units and workshops will attain such Green Certificates. 

The objectives of the MoU:


	
	Energy efficiency in manufacturing facilities and railway workshops. 
	
	
	Greening of Railway properties. 
	
	
	Demonstrative pilots of ‘net-zero energy buildings/ railway stations’. 
	
	
	Capacity and skill development by continuous sharing of best practices on energy and environment through training programmes.
	
	
	Development of Green procurement policy, waste management policy, solid waste disposal, carbon neutrality, phytoremediation.
	


 

Three Coffee Table Publications –one each on Energy Efficiency, GreenCo Rating and Green Buildings(including railway stations) were also released for wide circulation as part of efforts taken by the Indian Railways team as envisaged in MoU.

Indian Railways & CII have been working together since signing of MOU in 2016 on Green Rating & Energy Efficiency Studies of IR’s Production Units & major workshops and after assessment in last three years, 50 Railway Units including workshops and production units have achieved GreenCo certification. In addition, 12 Railway stations and 16 more buildings and other facilities have also achieved Green certification.

GreenCo rating system developed by CII evaluates the green initiative and the rate of performance of industrial units who are pursuing environmentally sustainable practice and also certifies green building, green campus and green schools etc.

                Indian Railways announces certain Freight incentives to give a boost to the economy. Member (Traffic), Railway Board Shri P.S. Mishra, announced these measures, to support various segments of the industry. Details of these measures announced today are as under:


	Freight rate related measures:


 


	Levy of Busy Season Charge Deferred: 



	BSC, which is levied @ 15% from 1 Oct-30 June, has been deferred till further advice (Except for iron ore and POL).



	Coal & coke and container traffic are already exempt.



	Waiver of Supplementary charges on Mini and Two point rakes:



	The 5% Supplementary charges applicable on Loading on Mini and Two point rakes is being waived off. 
	This is likely to boost loading of Smaller cargo sizes and help cement, steel, food grains and fertilizers loading.


 


	Round-trip charging on container traffic:



	As per haulage charge rating of container traffic, 0-50 km is the minimum distance slab for charging.
	It is seen that container traffic in this ultra short lead (0-50 km) is very low at present.
	Therefore, round-trip charging of container trip has been introduced for a distance of less than 50 km on each way.
	Under this scheme, haulage charge for 0-100 km slab will be charged for total to and fro movement, instead of charging for 0-50 km slab each way.
	Impact- this comes out to be about  35% cheaper per TEU for the complete round-trip 
	It is expected to especially give a fillip to EXIM traffic between ports and Inland Container Depots.


    3. Discount on movement of empty containers and empty flat wagons 


	A discount of 25% discount in haulage charge of containers has been given to encourage movement of empty/flat to ports; thereby increasing loaded container traffic in return
	It is expected to enhance price-competitiveness of Railway vis-a-vis other modes of transport and expand freight basket by capturing new traffic.


4. Large-scale de-notification of commodities for container traffic


	As per container haulage charging policy, notified commodities are charged at Container Class Rates (CCR), which is 15% lower than General Tariff Rates (GTR). Rest of the commodities are charged at Freight All Kind (FAK) rates, which are even lower than CCR.
	Recently, 90 more commodities have been de-notified, which brought down their haulage charge from CCR to FAK rates.
	Now, out of total 635 commodities in Goods Tariff, only 38 commodities are under notified/CCR rates (11 of these are POL commodities).


5. Freight Marketing initiatives:


	Induction of more New Modified Goods  car rakes and introduction of new design of Bi level auto car wagons (BCACBM wagons). 
	Rationalization of Road Railer with 4 new weight slabs instead of earlier 3 weight slabs. More competitive rates.
	Weight and weighment conditions relaxed in perishable traffic  when loaded in goods wagons



	Measures to enhance ease of business and digitisation



	Pan-India Implementation of eT-RR 



	Facility of Electronic Transmission of Railway Receipts (eT-RR) has been successfully implemented across the country wef 01.08.2019
	eT-RR is user-friendly and paperless transaction system where Railway Receipt is generated and transmitted electronically to customer through Freight Operation Information System (FOIS). Delivery of goods is given through e-surrender of eT-RR. That is, customer is saved the hassle of carrying physical Railway Receipt from originating to destination station
	This facility is expected to bring down the transaction costs of rail customers, and also pave the way for greater digitisation.


2. Weighment-related reforms


	Pre-weigh bin system for weighment of goods traffic has been permitted in private sidings. This is expected to bring down the time for Weighment and loading, and also bring in higher accuracy in Weighment. It shall go a long way in redressing the issues related to Weighment.


 


	As per earlier policy, if a second Weighment of wagons was done, the higher of the two reading was considered final for charging or levy of penalty.  Now, the policy has been modified to state that second weighment will be considered final for charging. This policy change makes the provision of second weighment meaningful and is expected to redress customers’ grievance in accuracy of Weighment.


 


	Low density commodities like Pet Coke, Met Coke, Chuni and De-oiled cake have also been exempted from mandatory weighment. This is likely to save transit time and increase fluidity, which translate in to cost saving for customers also.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the Dasna-Hapur section of Delhi-Meerut Expressway (package-3) in UP’s Pilakhuwa today. Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways Gen (Retd) V K Singh, Deputy Chief Minister of UP Shri Keshav Chandra Maurya, Lok Sabha member Shri Rajendra Agrawal, Rajya Sabha member Shri Anil Agrawal and several MLAs were present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Gadkari said the Delhi-Meerut Highway will bring prosperity to the region, and will help in decongesting the National Capital Region. It will also lead to reduction in travel time by more than 1 hour, and bring significant reduction in pollution level. He said, highways and infrastructure projects are directly related to the development of an area. 

Shri Gadkari announced that the Ghazipur-Dasna section of this road (package 2) will be completed in next three months, and the entire Delhi-Meerut Expressway will be ready for commuters within six months.

Gen (Retd) V K Singh lauded the efforts of engineers and construction workers in completing a strong, wide and very useful road in such a short time. He said, the government has embarked upon an ambitious infrastructure development plan for the NCR, which will change the development scenario of the entire area.

Shri Keshav Chandra Maurya assured that the State government will accord priority to solving the problems before the highways sector, as these are important for upliftment of people in villages and suburbs. 

The 82-kilometre long Delhi-Meerut Expressway connects Delhi with Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh. A sum of Rs 8346 crore is likely to be spent on the project. The third package from Dasna to Hapur in Ghaziabad is over 22 kilometre long. Its civil cost is Rs 1058 crore. This 6-lane section has 2+2 lane service roads on either sides, and a 4.68-kilometre long 6-lane elevated corridor at Pilkhuwa. It has seven new bridges, a flyover at Hapur bypass, 11 vehicular underpasses, two pedestrian underpasses, two foot overbridges, six major junctions and 105 minor junctions.

The 4.68-kilometre long 6-lane elevated corridor at Pilkhuwa has been conferred Gold Medal for innovation in construction technology, and has also been awarded as outstanding concrete structure of western UP.

The Delhi-Meerut Expressway project is being implemented in four packages – (i) an 8.72 km long 6-lane expressway/ 8-lane NH 24 from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to Ghazipur border, already completed in June 2018, (ii) a 19.28 km long 6-lane expressway/ 8-lane NH 24 from Ghazipur border to Dasna in UP, (iii) 22.23 km long 6-lane NH 24 with 2+2 lane service roads on either sides from Dasna to Hapur in UP, and (iv) a 31.78 km long greenfield 6-lane expressway from Hapur to Meerut. 

Shri Nitin Gadkari also launched the use of plastic waste in National Highways construction at Delhi-Ghaziabad border. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways Is encouraging the use of waste plastic in highway construction, especially on National Highways within 50 km periphery of urban areas that have a population of 5 lakh or more. A stretch of road has recently been constructed using waste plastic on NH-48 near Dhaula Kuan. A portion of Delhi- Meerut expressway and Gurugram- Sohna road have also been planned for construction, using plastic waste. 

Plastic waste has already been used in wearing courses of National Highways construction on the pilot basis in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The technology used is in compliance with the guidelines of Indian Roads Congress for the use of waste plastic in Hot Bituminous Mixes in wearing courses. Construction of 1 kilometre of 4-lane highway can help in disposal of approximately 7 tonnes of waste plastic.

Laboratory as well as field performance studies carried out in India have identified many advantages of using waste plastic in bituminous mix for road constructions such as; Higher resistance to deformation, Increased durability and improved fatigue life and Improved stability and strength. This also reduces consumption of bitumen in the mixes. Besides, this process opens up an avenue for environment friendly disposal of waste plastic. Adding value to waste plastic will go a long way in curbing the menace of plastic littering, besides helping in disposal of tonnes of plastic waste in the years to come. NHAI has also planned taking up the task of long term performance monitoring of National highways using plastic waste with bituminous mixes for evaluation of pavement performance. This will bring confidence amongst the practicing engineers.

                The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has issued detailed SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for acceptance of Driving Licence, Registration Certificate and other transport related information presented in electronic form. The Central Motor Vehicles Rules were amended by the Ministry  in  November 2018, enabling production of documents such as certificate of registration, insurance, fitness and permit, the driving licence, certificate for pollution under check and any other relevant documents in electronic form. 

With this revision of rules, it is now not necessary for people to carry the relevant paper documents. However, for the electronic documents to be treated as legally recognized at par with the original documents as per the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, it is necessary that they are available  on DigiLocker or mParivahan app carried by the user. If the e documents are not available on mParivahan or DigiLocker then they will not be treated as legally recognized at par with the original documents 

The mParivahan mobile app is being provided by the  Ministry of Road Transport & highways through NIC.  The details of RC, DL, Fitness Validity, Insurance Validity, Permit Validity are available on real time basis on this mobile app by entering the DL number/ Registration number  pertaining to the vehicles.

The DigiLocker platform of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India, has the facility to pull a citizen's Driving Licence or the Certificate of Registration details from VAHAN and make it available in the Digilocker App in an electronic form.

The data related to the insurance of new vehicles and renewal of insurance of vehicles is reflected on the eChallan ap that is available only to enforcement officers.

As per the SOP issued by the Ministry people can produce the documents or other information either through the DigiLocker app or the mParivahan app. They can download the Driving Licence or the Registration Certificate through these apps and store on their mobile devices. They can also show particulars relating to the Driving Licence or the Vehicle through the mParivahan app on the mobile through internet connectivity. The enforcement agencies can simultaneously access these details from eChallan app, which has data for on-line verification of vehicle and its license status. Off-line verification of mParivahan QR Code is also available on this platform. Normal android mobile apps can be used for this purpose. 

This benefits both the enforcement agencies as they are not required to physically handle any document, their office need not maintain any inventory or record, and the citizens as they will not be required to carry documents. This fast, transparent and accountable system also ensures real-time availability of offence status to the transport and traffic enforcement officers and the citizens.

                The President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, unveiled the first Indigenous High Temperature Fuel Cell System developed by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in partnership with Indian industries under India’s flagship program named “New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI)” on the occasion of CSIR Foundation Day at VigyanBhawan, New Delhi today.



A unique example of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) among CSIR’s three Laboratories [CSIR-NCL, Pune; CSIR-NPL, New Delhi & CSIR-CECRI, Karaikudi (Chennai Center)] and two Indian industries; M/s Thermax Limited, Pune and M/s Reliance Industries Limited, Mumbai exemplified exploiting materials of science developments at CSIR laboratories into practice by Industry. The 5.0 kW fuel cell system generates power in a green manner using methanol / bio-methane, with heat and water as bi-products for further use; amounting to greater than 70% efficiency, which otherwise may not be possible by other energy sources. 

The Fuel Cells developed are based on High Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane (HTPEM) Technology. The development is most suitable for distributed stationary power applications like; for small offices, commercial units, data centers etc.; where highly reliable power is essential with simultaneous requirement for air-conditioning. This system will also meet the requirement of efficient, clean and reliable backup power generator for telecom towers, remote locations and strategic applications as well. This development would replace Diesel Generating (DG) sets and help reduce India’s dependence on crude oil. 

The developed technology is world class and the development has placed India in the league of developed nations which are in possession of such a knowledgebase. CSIR has an impressive portfolio of global patents on these developments. In the field of clean energy, Fuel Cell distributed power generation systems are emerging as promising alternative to grid power. The Fuel Cells fit well in India’s mission of replacing diesel with green and alternate fuels. The development of fuel cell technology is indigenous and carries immense national importance in terms of non-grid energy security.

                The Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Health & Family Welfare, Dr. Harsh Vardhan todaylaunched UMMID (Unique Methods of Management and treatment of Inherited Disorders) initiative and inaugurated NIDAN (National Inherited Diseases Administration) Kendras, which is being supported by Department of Biotechnology (DBT),M/o Science and Technology.



 

Speaking on the occasion in New Delhi, the Minister for Science & Technology brought attention to the issue of ensuring proper treatment to children and creation of awareness amongst the masses and urged upon all to dwell more into finding solutions. Congratulating DBT for supporting this path-breaking initiative, Dr Harsh Vardhan said “With the program being implemented at government hospitals, people who cannot afford expensive care for genetic disorders will be benefited”. He further emphasized on the use of cutting edge scientific technology and molecular medicine for extending Universal Health Coverage for all.



Dr. Renu Swarup, Secretary, DBT also highlighted how UMMID is a path-breakinginitiative in the health-care sector. She said “UMMID initiative is meeting the hopes of large number of persons with inherited diseases”. 

Taking into account that congenital and hereditary genetic diseases are becoming a significant health burden in India, and realizing the need for adequate and effective genetic testing and counselling services. DBT has started the UMMID Initiative which is designed on the concept of ‘Prevention is better than Cure’. In India’s urban areas, congenital malformations and genetic disorders are the third most common cause of mortality in newborns. With a very large population and high birth rate, and consanguineous marriage favored in many communities, prevalence of genetic disorders is high in India, the UMMID initiative aims (i) to establish NIDAN Kendras to provide counselling, prenatal testing and diagnosis, management, and multidisciplinary care in Government Hospitals wherein the influx of patients is more, (ii) to produce skilled clinicians in Human Genetics, and (iii) to undertake screening of pregnant women and new born babies for inherited genetic diseases in hospitals at aspirational districts.

As a part of this initiative, in the first phase, five NIDAN Kendras have been established to provide comprehensive clinical care.



 

Training Centres at Madras Medical Mission- Chennai; SGPGIMS- Lucknow; CDFD – Hyderabad; AIIMS- New Delhi; MAMC- New Delhi; NIIH- Mumbai and CMC Vellore have been supported to provide training in Biochemical Genetics, Cytogenetics, Molecular Genetics, and Clinical Genetics to the clinicians from government hospitals. Screening of 10,000 pregnant women and 5000 new born babies per year for inherited genetic diseases will be taken up at the following seven aspirational districts.



 

The department is planning to expand the program and establish more Nidan Kendras in other parts of the country, train more clinicians in clinical genetics and cover more aspirational districts for screening of pregnant women and new born babies for inherited genetic diseases to provide comprehensive clinical care, in the next phase under this UMMID initiative. 

The Government of India has launched the National Health Policy, 2017 aiming to shift focus from “sick-care” to “wellness”.  UMMID initiative shall work towards achieving wellness by promoting prevention of genetic diseases.

                Union Minister of Science & Technology, Dr.  Harsh Vardhan, today inaugurated the National Centre for Clean Coal Research and Development at Indian Institute of Science (IISc)-Bengaluru.  Government of India through Department of Science & Technology, has set up the National Centre for Clean Coal Research and Development (NCCCR&D) as a national level consortium on clean coal R&D, led by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc)-Bengaluru.



 

“The breakthrough research being pursued at IISc in clean coal domain could potentially be game changer for meeting the energy needs of the country in terms of higher efficiency and capacity at lower operating costs and size. I am sure this would result in research, development and demonstration of state-of-art tools, products and processes which are of critical importance for our energy security,” said Dr Vardhan

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also dedicated an Interdisciplinary Centre for Energy Research(ICER) to the Nation which is India’s first of its kind centre equipped with state-of-art facilities for conducting wide spectrum of energy research by knowledge network of elite researchers.



 

“I am sure all these intense scientific efforts and collective endeavors would enable us to realise the vision of an affordable, efficient, compact reliable Clean Energy systems which will be robust and suitable in diverse geographic conditions,” said the Union Minister, while addressing the scientists. Adding further he stated “Government of India will be facilitating all such efforts and complementing and supplementing both in terms of technical knowledge and finances, adequately for strengthening ICER, in particular and scientific community in general.”

 



 

Secretary, Department of Science & Technology (DST) ,Prof. Ashutosh Sharma and Director, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Prof. Anurag Kumar, were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Prof. Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST emphasised the need for accelerated clean energy innovation. “Creation of a eco-system for R&D and innovations involving all stakeholders is a priority and DST plans to have novel instruments and mechanisms for engaging stakeholders and developing appropriate partnership based on Technology Readiness Level (TRL) stages.

Prof. Anurag Kumar, Director, IISc reiterated institutes commitment to contribute to larger national goals and pursue R&D endeavours to benefit the humanity through sustainable interventions. He stated that having established a strong foundation in these areas, ICER plans to expand its activities in several energy-related areas with an emphasis on process and material development, the latter involving collaborations with the manufacturing industry. 

Interdisciplinary Centre for Energy Research (ICER) is one of the youngest centres at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). It was conceived to take up socially relevant research in line with national-level missions of the Government of India, which will directly benefit the people of the nation and the world. The Centre hosts faculty members from different departments having diverse engineering and science backgrounds, pursuing cutting-edge research in the broad area of energy. Translational research carried out by ICER faculty members has resulted in technology transfers in India and abroad. Apart from a doctoral program, extensive skill development programs have also been conducted by the Centre in line with national requirements. ICER has so focused on research breakthroughs and developing sustainable technologies for renewable energy, combustion, concentrated solar power (CSP), next-generation solar photovoltaic (PV), novel energy storage technologies, hydrogen, biofuels and bio-mass.

National Centre for Clean Coal Research and Development (NCCCR&D) is a national level consortium on clean coal R&D, led by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc)-Bengaluru.  The primary goal is to address several critical R&D challenges towards the development of clean coal technologies, in tandem with developing supercritical power plant technologies, both at the materials and system level. 

In order to achieve international targets on climate change by minimizing anthropogenic emissions and also to address the ever-growing energy demand of India, development of clean coal technologies to reduce carbon emissions from coal-based power plants has become a prime necessity for India. The pathways identified for lowering the carbon footprint of coal-based thermal power plants is by shifting towards high efficiency advanced ultra-supercritical (AUSC) steam power plants as well as supercritical carbon dioxide (s-CO2) based Brayton cycle power plants, along with exploration of new combustion and gasification technologies.

                India has joined the Global Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Research and Development (R&D) Hub as a new member. This was announced today by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology in New Delhi. This expands the global partnership working to address challenges and improve coordination and collaboration in global AMR R&D to 16 countries, the European Commission, two philanthropic foundations and four international organisations (as observers).

 

Congratulating India on its induction as a new member, the acting Chair of the Global AMR R&D Hub Board of Members and Director General of the Centre for Communicable Diseases and Infection Control at the Public Health Agency of Canada, Ms.BersabelEphrem, said,“I am very pleased to welcome India as an important addition to our global partnership. Addressing AMR requires global action with active participation from all world regions and One Health sectors. Expanding the membership of the Hub works towards ensuring that different countries needs are incorporated when considering AMR R&D activities and actions”.

 

The Global AMR R&D Hub was launched in May 2018 in the margins of the 71st session of the World Health Assembly, following a call from G20 Leaders in 2017. The Global AMR R&D Hub supports global priority setting and evidence-based decision-making on the allocation of resources for AMR R&D through the identification of gaps, overlaps and potential for cross-sectoral collaboration and leveraging in AMR R&D. The operation of the Global AMR R&D Hub is supported through a Secretariat, established in Berlin and currently financed through grants from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).

 

From this year onward, India will be the member of Board of members of Global AMR R&D Hub. By partnering with the Global AMR R&D Hub, India looks forward to working with all partners to leverage their existing capabilities, resources and collectively focus on new R&D intervention to address drug resistant infections. AMR is the ability of a microbe to resist the effects of medication that once could successfully treat the microbe. Today, the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance continues unabated around the world. Given the important and interdependent human, animal, and environmental dimensions of antimicrobial resistance, India considers it reasonable to explore issues of antimicrobial resistance through the lens of One Health approach which should be supported by long-term commitments from all stakeholders.

 

In a major boost to combat one of the gravest risks to global health a dedicated special vehicle in terms of Global AMR R&D Hub may allow partners to devote expertise in order to accelerate global action against antimicrobial resistance.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will dedicate to the nation India’s second riverine Multi Modal terminal built at Sahibganj in Jharkhand on 12 September, 2019.  The Prime Minister will inaugurate the state of the art terminal through a two -way digital communication system at an event in Ranchi, Jharkhand. The Minister of State for Shipping (Independent Charge) and Chemical and Fertilizers Shri Mansukh Mandaviya will be present at Sahibganj, Jharkhand.

Built at a cost of Rs 290 crores in a record time of about two years, the Prime Minister himself had laid the foundation stone of IWAI’s Sahibganj multimodal terminal in April, 2017. This is the second of the three Multi Modal Terminals being constructed on river Ganga under Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP).  Earlier, in November, 2018 the Prime Minister had inaugurated the MMT at Varanasi. 

The Multi-Modal terminal at Sahibganj will open up industries of Jharkhand and Bihar to the global market and provide Indo-Nepal cargo connectivity through waterways route. It will play an important role in transportation of domestic coal from the local mines in Rajmahal area to various thermal power plants located along NW-1. Other than coal, stone chips, fertilisers, cement and sugar are other commodities expected to be transported through the terminal. 

The multi-modal terminal will also help to create direct employment of about 600 people and indirect employment of about 3000 people in the region. The convergence of Road-Rail-River Transport at Sahibganj through the new multi-modal terminal will connect this part of the hinterland to Kolkata, Haldia and further to the Bay of Bengal. Also, Sahibganj will get connected to North-East States through Bangladesh by river-sea route. It 

The capacity of the terminal is 30 lakh tonnes per annum. It will grow to 54.8 lakh tonnes per annum after an investment of Rs 376 crores for capacity enhancement in Phase II under PPP mode. The development in Phase II will be entirely made by the private concessionaire.   Further, a freight village is also proposed on 335 acres of land in contiguity with the terminal.

The MMTs are being built as part of the Jal Marg Vikas Project that aims to develop the stretch of River Ganga between Varanasi to Haldia for navigation of large vessels upto1500-2000 tonnes weight, by maintaining a drought of 2-3 metres in this stretch of the river and setting up other systems required for safe navigation. The objective is to promote inland waterways as a cheaper and more environment friendly means of transport, especially for cargo movement. Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) is the project Implementing Agency.

	Government to ensure standardized assessment system 
	Detailed discussions with States on Vision 2025 
	Extensive focus on promoting Apprenticeship training; Launches pilot programme to give incentives to TPAs (Third Party Aggregators) to further expand program 


 

 

On behalf of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), UnionMinister Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey today announced the Center’s commitment of INR 560 crores to the State Governments to promote demand-driven, industry linked skill development at the ground level. 

The announcement was made by the Hon’ble Minister at the Annual National Conference of State Ministers held in New Delhi, today which also saw the commencement of the ‘Apprenticeship Pakhwada’, a 15-day event aimed at driving widespread awareness of the Apprenticeship. The event witnessed collaboration with 22 organizations to provide apprenticeship training opportunities to more than 2.5 lakh youth in the country. 

 

This annual conference acts as a platform for the stakeholders of the various skilling schemes across the country, especially state government skill ministers to meet and discuss various issues affecting the skilling efforts in their states. The event saw more than 80 representatives across States participating in the conference namely - 

Addressing the States on their collaboration on Skill Development, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey said, “Skill development is a demand-driven subject and thus it is important that we give more power to the States to ensure quality and market relevant outcome. It is important that we map and strike a balance between the traditional and new age skills, right at the district level and also target a shift from un-organized to the organized market through our Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) program.”

“The States should ensure integration of skills right at the school level so that the youth can decide which skills to hone. At the University level, we should promote apprenticeship training as part the regular degree courses, since on-the-job training is the pre-requisite for any job,”he further added. 

The Hon’ble Minister said that the government, both at the Center and the State level, should work towards a common standardized assessment system. “We should promote those who are contributing with quality outcome and discourage every sort of corruption.”

The event also saw detailed discussion on Vision 2025 of Skill India and the direction that the Ministry and State Governments should take.  “It is imperative that the Central and the State Governments work closely with each other to ensure that we meet our Vision 2025”, he said.  

Giving a direction to States, Shri R.K Singh, Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship said, “Our focus should be on secondary and tertiary sectors than primary sectors for jobs opportunities now; and on the local demands for goods and services than on global ones. States should consistently undertake environmental scan for market relevant skills. We should ensure our alignment to jobs of the future so that India has a competitive advantage. It is also important that our trainers are upgraded consistently to latest curriculum and our infrastructure should be of global standards focusing quality delivery.”

The event also listed the recent amendmentsin Apprenticeship Act with an objective to increase linkage with more companies and industries. As a crucial support from MSDE, incentives to Third Party Aggregators (TPAs)was also announced to strengthen the bond with several stakeholders andaspiring youth to achieve the set target of engaging 10 lac apprentices during current financial year. The event also witnessed felicitation of industries with more than 3000 apprenticeseach and award distribution to winners of All India Competition of Apprenticeships held by Directorate General of Training.

The inaugural session of the conference commenced with the Ministry talking about its achievements so far and also highlighting new initiatives that have been rolled out to further boost the government’s vision of skilled workforce. Close to 80 lakh youth have been skilled under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) since its launch in 2015. More than 28 lakh youth have been oriented under Recognition of Prior Learning Program, an initiative under PMKVY bringing about a major shift from the unorganized to the organized economy. MSDE has more than 25000+ institutes and centers today delivering more than 3000+ courses across 37 sectors in the country. These include the state-of-the-art 629 Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKK); targeting one center in each district of the country.

Comprehensive reforms in Apprenticeship rules 1962 have been approved in the 36th CAC meeting held on 10th July, 2019 and had been sent for Gazette notification to further streamline the process. Major reforms include:


	Upper limit for engaging apprentices increased from 10% to 15%
	Size limit of an establishment with mandatory obligation to engage apprentices lowered from 40 to 30
	Payment of stipend for 1st year has been fixed rather than linking it to minimum wages, 10% to 15% hike in stipend for 2nd and 3rd year to apprentice
	Duration of apprenticeship training for optional trade can be from 6 months to 36 months


 

MSDE signed MoUs with states with mutual consent on achieving particular apprenticeship numbers to further reinforceMSDE’s association with state Industries and apprentices.The role of state governments is crucial because as per the Act, all apprenticeship in the private sector, State PSUs and state government departments are to be regulated and closely monitored by the respective state government. A significant potential area for promoting apprenticeships, particularly in MSMEs and informal sector are under the jurisdiction of state, which remain untouched. The Ministry’s MoU singing with the states shows itscommitment for expansion of outreach of apprenticeship training to maximum number of industries as well as aspirants.

The platform was additionally utilized to felicitate industry partners and other stakeholders to recognize and appreciate their indispensable contribution in consolidation of the ecosystem. The ministry also presented its vision document for 2020-2025.Reform of the Indian skills development system is proceeding swiftly with substantial change underway and more planned in many key areas, to make the supply of skills completely aligned with the growing demands of the Indian economy.

Apprenticeship has been recognized as an effective way to empower young people tosmoothly shift from school & college to work whilst at the same time improving links between industry and training institutions. The National Apprenticeship Programme plays a large part in the task of up-skilling India’s workforce, offering the opportunity to share costs among different parties (employers, individuals and the government) and to involve governments, employers and workers in partnership. Apprenticeship is a win-win situation both for industry and youth in coming together to help make the vision of ‘Skilled India’ a reality in future.

During the Pakhwada period, the ministry will hold a number of workshops and seminars across major centres in the states with the aim of creating wider awareness about the Apprenticeship Training amongst establishments and employers across manufacturing and service sectors. These will include all stakeholders including SSCs, industry partners, state governments, industry associations, third party aggregators and line ministry in various parts of the country.

	Launch of Mochi Swabhimaan Initiative – a nationwide effort in which LSSC will support the cobbler community who provide leather-based services, with CSR funds ensuring they work in a dignified manner


Speaking at a ceremony today where more than a thousand candidates in the leather sector were awarded Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Certificates in Chennai, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Hon’ble Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), Govt. of India said the Leather Sector is an Export driven sector and has the potential to create 2 million jobs in the next 5 years. The Government of India had recently announced in the Budget of 2019 that export duty be rationalized on raw and semi-finished leather increasing opportunities in the sector.

Dr. Pandey distributed Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) certificates to the graduating trainees under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) of Skill India, who were trained, assessed and certified on their existing skill sets across leather companies with the due effort of the Leather Sector Skill Council (LSSC). The certification ceremony was graced by Shri K Pandiarajan, Minister for Tamil language, Tamil Culture and Archeology.

Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship works closely with the LSSC under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) which encourages skill development to boost employability and productivity of youth by incentivizing skill training.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL), under PMKVY, certifies skills acquired informally and drives youth to venture into aspirational job roles. For the industry, formalizing the skills of employees will give a clear picture about the available skill sets, skill gaps and the need for upgradation to achieve desirable quality and productivity benchmarks. The outstanding candidates, certified under RPL, were given Best in Class Employer Scheme and HRD Scheme certificates during the ceremony.

As of last week, more than 2 million candidates across the country have received RPL under the PMKVY (2016-20). As per the latest report (17 September), of the 2.78 million candidates enrolled, 2.70 million have been trained while 2.15 million have been assessed and 2.03 million have been given certificates.

Lauding the efforts of LSSC, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Hon’ble Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship stated, “Globally, India is the second largest producer of leather garments and footwear and with this phenomenal market potential, the sector seems promising in the years to come. When we look back at our past, India has always had a rich heritage of leather crafts like footwear and accessories. These were prepared by highly skilled craftsmen from various clusters like Agra, Kanpur, Ambur and other regions. Today, these skills need to be preserved and people should be encouraged to make them a means of sustainable livelihood. I am glad to see the outcome of your RPL programs undertaken in close collaboration with the industry. I congratulate all the candidates who are receiving their certificates today and wish them better opportunities for continued learning and career development. I wish you all great success and I extend continued support to LSSC team and all their partners.”

“The Government of India has allowed 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector and rationalized export duty on raw and semi-finished leather. The sector employees over 2.5 million people and has potential to create 2 million jobs in the next 5 years,” he further added.

India accounts for about 13% of the world’s leather production. Footwear and Leather products in the world. The leather and leather products industry contribute less than 1% to India’s GDP and Footwear industry contributes about 2% to India’s GDP. Indian leather industry has huge potential for exports. It can reach USD 9.0 billion by 2020, from the present level of USD 5.85 billion. India has trade agreements with Japan, Korea, ASEAN, Chile etc., and is negotiating Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with European Union, Australia etc.

“Fashion and trends have a great influence in this industry. There are many opportunities for entrepreneurship in traditional leather trades and new forms of leather substitutes. We need to cater to basic needs as well as luxury segments, with vast potential for exports. On this occasion, I would advise the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to review their manufacturing processes in terms of quality of output and wastage reduction by skilled professionals. I am also happy to announce the “Mochi Swabhimaan Initiative, a nation-wide activity where LSSC will extend support to the cobbler community who provide leather-based services, with CSR funds and bring respect to their skills by giving them better working environment in the form of kiosks/umbrellas . The government will also support this idea and will ensure they work in a dignified manner,” said Dr. Pandey.

“Technology has had a huge impact on every industry and leather is not left behind. While your manufacturing set up and factory premises need quick upgrades you should also focus on today’s e-commerce scenario. This brings in the need for multiskilling the workforce in the leather industry, since they will need appropriate digital skills to interact with online systems and a global customer base. I hope you are already taking these steps in this direction to expand your global outreach,” said the Minister.

To recognize and enhance the value of skilled manpower, LSSC has successfully implemented the RPL program to certify the workforce as per the National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF). The certification will contribute to the mobility of the workforce and will reduce employer dependence for recognition. Particularly, for the women who form a large chunk of the workforce, RPL will encourage them to enhance their skills basis their certification levels.

	Tata Group to invest Rs. 300 crore in setting up the 4.5 acres campus at Sion
	IIS aims to enroll 5,000 students per year with campus placement of 70% trainees


 In the quest to make India the Skill Capital of the World, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Union Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), today laid the foundation stone of Indian Institute of Skills (IIS) at Mumbai to provide skill training in highly specialized areas to students who want to pursue technical education after completing Class X and Class XII, making them employable and industry ready for the New India and the global market. The vision behind setting up IIS was to build world-class skill training centres in line with reputed educational institutes like Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and Indian Institution of Management (IIM), with first-hand learning facilities from internationally renowned existing skill institutions.

 

Shri Amarjeet Mishra, MoS status Vice-Chairman of Maharashtra Film, Stage & Cultural Development Corporation Ltd (MFSCDCL), Shri Mangesh M Kudalkar, MLA (Kurla Constituency); Shri Malik Abdul Rashid (Kaptan), Corporator; Shri Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman,Tata Sons; Mr. AM Naik, Chairman, National Skill Development Corporation & Group Chairman, Larsen & Toubro Limited; Shri KP Krishnan, Secretary, MSDE and other senior officers of MSDE were also present at the inauguration of the IIS. 

 

Tata Education Development Trust (TEDT) was selected as the private partner for setting up IIS at NSTI campus in Mumbai through a competitive bidding process. The Tata Group is investing about Rs. 300 crore in the 4.5 acres campus that aims to bring best-in-class infrastructure and facilities to students. The aim of the Institute is to ensure that 5000 trainees will be passing out every year with 70% placement opportunities.

The Union Cabinet had given its nod to set up Indian Institute of Skills (IISs) in three locations of the country — Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Kanpur, to give wings to the Skill India Mission. These institutes will be constructed & operated on a PPP (Public-Private Partnership) model and in not-for-profit basis. 

Envisaged as world-class skill training center imbibing best practices from internationally renowned existing skill institutions, the institute will facilitate learnings and trainings through strong industry connect in both public and private sectors. The courses in this institute will include modern training methodologies using digital and augmented learning platforms. It is also an important step towards promoting apprenticeship-embedded courses and offering higher order qualifications leading up to certificates, diplomas and even degrees in conjunction with universities.

Inaugurating the institute, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Hon’ble Union Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, said, “The concept of Indian Institute of Skills (IIS) was envisaged by the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji himself when he had visited the Vocational Education and Training Center in Singapore. It is under his able guidance and direction that this institute will be on the lines of the IITs and the IIMs that we have in our country. It will aspire to earn a similar reputation, stature and world-class infrastructure to cater to the demands of the international market and modern requirements. Just like how we are now being known for ‘Make in India’, soon we will be known for ‘Skilled in India’ as well. 

The driving force behind setting up a state-of-the-art training institution like the Indian Institute of Skills (IISs) is to help candidates equip themselves with marketable skills. There is a need to build a skilled workforce equipped with the required skillsets to meet the demand of Industry 4.0, powered by technology like automation, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, cyber technology, energy conservation etc. The skill scenario is changing world over, and these institutes will keep us competitive. The setting up of the institute in Mumbai will also cater to aspirations of the youth of Maharashtra eager to become a part of the new-age industrial economy,” he added.

The Government has provided land to the private partner for a period of 25 years for the institute, with comprehensive project reviews every 5 years mapping performance outcome. 

Shri Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons extended his best wishes on the foundation ceremony and said that Tata is privileged to be a part of a project conceptualized by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, himself. He said that jobs are critical for economic growth and with the current demographic dividend, skill development is the appropriate solution to get the youth productively employed. He said that we need to ensure that latest market relevant skills are imparted to make the youth ready for jobs of the future. 

Along with the foundation laying ceremony, the dignitaries also undertook tree plantation today at the National Skill Training Institute campus in Mumbai.

	53 Trainers felicitated for outstanding contribution, including experts of WorldSkills Competition winners, trainers from NSTI, ITI, JSS and from reputed Corporates
	Kaushalacharya Awards to become an annual ceremony


In a bid to motivate and incentivize more trainers to join the Skill India Mission, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) today organized Kaushalacharya Samadar 2019 to felicitatetrainers from different sectors for exceptional contribution towards creating a future-ready and skilled workforce. 

A total of 53 trainers from diverse backgrounds including experts of WorldSkills Competition winners, trainers from National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs), Industrial Training Centres (ITI), Jan Sikshan Sansthans (JSS) and trainers from reputed Corporate houses were honored at a gathering of government and industrial experts held on the occasion of Teachers’ Day by Skill India. Renewing the pledge to improve the skilling ecosystem of the country these Trainers included19 Expertsof winners from Team India who competed at WorldSkills 2019 in Kazan, Russia; 15 Skill Trainers from the NSTI/ITI ecosystem; 9 Corporate trainers awarded from companies namely Adobe, IBM, Microsoft, Maruti, ONGC, Bosch, Bhel and Aegis; and 10 Trainers from JSS.

The Ministry also announced the “Kaushalacharya Awards” would be an annual event to recognize the contribution made by skill trainers in the vocational training ecosystem. By 2022 it is estimated India will need about 2.5 lakh trainers across the skilling ecosystem. NSDC and DGT are working together to create better quality trainers and assessors. To ensure standardization of training and learning, MSDE is working on creating world-class academies and putting in place rigorous accreditation processes. The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has introduced programs to for effective utilization of capacity and infrastructure across the network of National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) to achieve greater convergence between long-term and short-term skill ecosystem. Organisations like NIMI, NSTI, Central Staff Training and Research Institute (CSTRI) are working closely toward strengthening of trainers. 

Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Hon’ble Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, said, “The Guru-Shishya parampara has been a unique feature of ancient Indian civilization where our teachers imparted life’s lessons and skills to disciples. On this day, we honour our trainers who have imparted their learning to the youth and helped in moulding their careers. In order to motivate and recognize their contribution to the skilling ecosystem, I am happy to announce the Kaushalacharya Awards an annual ceremony to celebrate the teachers who are pillars of the Skill India edifice. It is only fitting that we honour our own Guruswho the global community has already recognized by showeringrich accolades on skilled Indian youth at WorldSkills International at Kazan, Russia, a week ago.”

Urging the industry to get into more longstanding partnerships, Shri Raj Kumar Singh, Hon’ble Minister of State, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, said, “Industrialisation in India had for long been hamstrung by a dearth of skilled manpower. The Skill India Mission has addressed the need for an equipped and skilled workforce. We are looking at introducing degree programs for trainers to boost technical education and vocational training in the country. Today’s event marks a special day where we celebrate all those trainers who have helped thousands of youth, and inspire many more technically equipped and experienced people to join the Skill India Mission.”

A special workbook aimed at building a meaningful learning experience for students was launched by the DGT. The book has been developed by the National Instructional Media Institute (NIMI), which designs and develops books and study material for ITIs. Representatives of Tata Strive, Quest Alliance, Mahindra Pride Class Room and NIMI attended the event where MSDE recognized their contribution to the workbook.

A manual of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was launched to boost training of trainers and assessors. The SOP provides instructions on how to implement and adhere to processes, frameworks and systems specified in the ‘Training of Trainers and Assessors Guidelines for Short-term skill development programmes’.

In a clear sign of increasing public-private partnership for training, an MoU was signed between DGT and Kaushalya Kameshwar Techno Solution Pvt Limited under which training will be provided in Industrial environment in mining sector courses. Kaushalya Kameshwar Techno Solution Pvt Limited is a Dhanbad-based company.

The evolution of skill training depends on the quality of instruction at the workplace and quality of instruction at the classroom.Corporates and universities have supported the Skill India Mission by providingtraining academies with quality infrastructure for training of trainers. The initiative has also been supported by international organisations like Temasek Foundation and Singapore Polytechnic that have bolstered capacity-building programs for trainers and assessors. This has allowed Standardized Guidelines and Standard Operating Procedure to be developed for the implementation of comprehensive training programme for trainers in the short-term skilling ecosystem.

On the occasion, MSDE felicitated the experts/ trainers of the 19 participants who won laurels for India at theWorldSkills Competition 2019 in Kazan, Russia on Aug 22-27. India won a Gold, a Silver, two bronze and 15 Medallion of Excellence at WorldSkills Competition and ranked 13th among 63 countries. Kaushalacharya Awards were also conferred on trainers from the Directorate of General Training (DGT), the nodal body for vocational training in India.

Gamlin, Secretary, DEPwD deposed before the UN Committee during the process of consideration of the report.

The UN Committee while appreciating the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016 and various initiatives of the Government of India raised queries relating to implementation of the provisions of the Act, measures taken/being taken by the Government to improve data, prohibit discrimination, especially amongst ethnic/religious minority groups, rehabilitation of internal displaced groups, protection from exploitation, protection of reproductive rights etc. The issues with regard to legal capacity of PwDs and the redressal mechanism for any violations under RPwD Act, 2016 were also discussed.

The Indian delegation replied to the queries raised by the UN Committee based on the constitutional provisions, provisions under the RPwD Act, other relevant laws and the affirmative actions so far taken in this regard. With reference to a query relating to J&K, the Secretary, DEPwD categorically stated that J&K is an integral part of India and the Government has taken adequate steps to make available medical facilities to all its citizens of J&K. She also highlighted the steps taken by the Government to protect the reproductive rights of all its citizens including women with disabilities.

                National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation along with UN-Habitat, is hosting a workshop on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable), during 23rd - 26th September, 2019 in New Delhi. The workshop was inaugurated by Shri Pravin Srivastava, Chief Statistician of India and Secretary, MoSPI. The delegates came from the National Statistical Offices of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Kyrgyzstan, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Kenya and UK and also had experts from UN-Habitat and European Commission. The Workshop is focusing on evolving a standardized definition of Rural and Urban habitations and sensitizing the participants on the developments taking place globally so that the member countries can adapt these definitions to suit the national requirements. The participants are being briefed about the new metric, Degree of Urbanization (DEGURBA), which is a classification that indicates the character of an area, based on the share of local population living in urban clusters and in urban centers. The main goal of the workshop is to introduce the new metric DEGURBA approach to city definition and get direct feedback from the participating countries on its applicability, need for adaptation and customization as per their national needs. 

2.         The experts explained that the definition of city is not uniform across countries and this poses a challenge and an opportunity for the collection of statistics at national / regional level. The workshop will largely focus on gaining momentum for having a global definition of city to support the SDGs monitoring on a comparable framework, on SDG 11 indicators and the applicable methodologies for their measurement and to explore the feasibility for adopting City Prosperity Initiative (CPI), a tool to measure the sustainability of cities. The measurement approach will be useful for urban planning as also for census operations.

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has assured the steel industry that the Government will be its friend and facilitator, and is committed to creating a conducive atmosphere for the industry. Inaugurating the 3rd International Galvanizing Conference in New Delhi today, he said that growth in India's energy needs will also fuel the growth in Steel consumption. PM Awas Yojana, Har Ghar Jal Yojana, plan to provide piped natural gas in 400 cities - all present great opportunity for the steel sector. He appealed to industry to reimagine strategy, contribute towards vision of $5 Trillion economy. India is blessed with raw material availability, demographic dividend, vast coastline and a large market. He said that We have all ingredients to benchmark with the best in the world and go beyond.

Shri Pradhan said the industry must focus on producing high quality, low cost products. “The steel industry must touch the lives of common citizens. Galvanised steel can play an important role by being cost effective. India is blessed with raw material availability, demographic dividend, vast coastline and a large market. We have the potential to benchmark our Steel industry with the best in the world. We must link our aspiration to the world market. Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's vision of $5 Trillion economy is not mere slogan, we must all work together to realise this vision. Industry must reimagine strategy to position itself as a global leader. Zinc industry is poised to grow, ensuring longevity of steel by reducing corrosion, and thereby adding to the GDP of the country.”, he added.

            The Minister of state for Steel Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste said that galvanization of steel with the help of Zinc makes it corrosion resistant, at less cost compared to the stainless steel. The more it is used, better it will be for the country. He said that industry should contribute positively in development of people and places, which have benefitted less from the economic growth. The steel industry must touch the lives of common citizens.

                Ministry of Mines has allowed SAIL to offload in a year up to a quantity equivalent to maximum 25% of total iron ore production in the previous year. It will be subject to clearance from the respective State Governments, where the mines are located, after following due procedure. It is valid for a period of 2 years. This implies that around 7 Million tonnes of iron ore, produced at its different mines in the States of Jharkhand, Odisha and Chattisgarh, can be offloaded by SAIL to the domestic market after getting necessary clearance from the respective State Governments. This will enable SAIL to not only fulfil its own requirement, but also to partially cater to shortfall in domestic iron ore requirement.  The order of Ministry of Mines follows pursuant efforts of the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, in this regard.

In a separate Order issued by the Ministry of Mines, SAIL has also been allowed to dispose of the old stock of 70 Million Tonnes of low grade iron fines and ores (including slime), lying dumped across different captive mines of SAIL. Necessary permission will have to be taken from the States, where the mines are located (i.e. Jharkhand, Odisha and Chattisgarh).  It is a definitive step towards Environment Protection as well as release of value from hitherto dumped material. 

It is pertinent to mention here that as per provision of Section 8A(6) of Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 (in short, MMDR Act, 1957), the lease of 31 working mines of iron ore is expiring on 31.03.2020. After the expiry, it is expected to lead to a shortfall of 60 Million Tonnes of iron ore in the market. 

Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan while lauding the initiative said, “Ensuring raw material security for Indian steel industry has been at the top of our agenda. Our Government has taken several efforts towards this and the orders passed by the Ministry of Mines is an important step in this direction”

                Aadi Mahotsav (Tribal Festival) organized by Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED), Ministry of Tribal Affairs went off to a colourful start this evening at Expo Centre Sector-62, Noida (UP). Smt. Renuka Singh, Minister of State for Tribal Affairs inaugurated the festival. Shri Deepak Khandekar, Secretary, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Shri Ramesh Chand Meena, Chairman TRIFED and many dignitaries were present on the occasion. The festival will continue from 11 am to 8.30 pm, daily till 8th October, 2019.

The Minister took a round of the Mahotsav and interacted with the tribal artists and lauded their significant role in the protection, preservation and promotion of the rare folk art and craft of the country. She said that TRIFED is doing an excellent job by holding such purposeful programmes across the country for connecting people and integrating India and for offering tribal artisans a platform to showcase their artistic creations to a bigger and wider mark. She spoke about the unity which can be seen in these kinds of events.

Sh. Ramesh Chand Meena elaborately explained that apart from handicrafts, the tribes gather from the forests a range of forest produces which include various tree-borne products like flowers, fruits, seeds, barks and leaves and various insect produces like honey. All these are hundred percent organic products. Knowing that organic food products command a premium price, Trifed plans to tap this premium niche market. Thus, ensuring that the benefit of higher prices accrues to the tribals.

Secretary, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Shri Deepak Khandekar expressed his happiness to have successfully launched the event. He briefed the public and brought to light the schemes and activities of Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Trifed is doing significant work in this direction and have now embraced e-commerce and digital platforms to take the business forward, he added.

Acclaimed artists and artisans, drawn from as many as 20 states of the country, including Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal and North-Eastern states are a part of this mega cultural razzmatazz and showcase their traditional art, craft and culture.  The traditional tribal jewellery, rare of the rarest craft items and artefacts will be a huge attraction for the inquisitive buyers.

TRIFED is engaged, heart and soul, in ameliorating the lot of small and marginal artists and artisans by inviting them to such mega cultural event and offering them space and genuine price of their product from the buyers. This also helps them to get rid of the middlemen usurping their profits. For the first time, tribal merchandize payments will be accepted through credit and debit cards in line with the national aspiration to go cashless. TRIFED is promoting all their tribal products on ONLINE platform too which is Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Paytm & GeM in a very aggressive way.

Union Minister for Tribal Affairs Shri Arjun Munda launched the Biggest Tribal movement to promote tribal enterprise through Bamboonomics in the country which will be a beacon for the rest of the world. He launched the movement for combating desertification and the climate change at “The Indian Perspective through Bamboonomics” session at ‘COP 14 UNCCD : TRIFED-GIZ’ organized at Greater Noida Expo today.

 

Shri Arjun Munda stated in his speech the importance of indigenous community in combating desertification and for environmental upgradation. He further said that tribal community has lived in a very eco-friendly manner for generations in and around the forest areas and they have never degraded the forest lands. So, their expertise and experience should be taken into consideration.

 

He said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has set the goal of additional 5 mha. under the Bonn Challenge and Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED would strive to support this national commitment. He met the Representatives from many countries and was requested by the Ministry of Agriculture, Benin and GIZ to attend and address their Bio Char Global Meet in November 2019.

 



 

Shri Pravir Krishna, MD, TRIFED introduced the “The 4P1000 Initiative: The Tribal Perspective through Bamboonomics” in the side event and explained the genesis of the revolution during the global meet (COP 14 of UNCCD) in New Delhi on the 13th September’19. The 4P1000 Initiative: The international initiative “4per1000”, launched by France on 1 December 2015 at the COP 21, consists of federating all voluntary stakeholders of the public and private sectors. He informed that how TRIFED will involve the tribal community of India for rehabilitating the degraded land without compromising the income of the poor in the garb of environmentally friendly development. He said that Bamboonomics has been designed in such a way that while doing the environmental services, the tribals will be earning. He also launched two International Committees.

  



 

The Side Event participants also deliberated and finalized TRIFED DELHI Declaration on 4P1000 Initiative: A Tribal Perspective through Bamboonomics. The Minister signed and announced the Delhi Declaration of TRIFED.

 

 

TRIFED is striving to integrate its Pradhan Mantri Van Dhan Yojna (PMVDY) with this new global environmental intervention termed as TICD (TRIFED’s Initiative to Combat Desertification). TRIFED proposed a business model to supplement the income of tribal community and put it on the world scale by partnering with the German Cooperation (GIZ). It called for globalization of this movement by further international cooperation. TRIFED’s message to UNCCD is that the 4P1000 Initiative with the tribal perspective through Bamboonomics is the best answer for combating desertification and rehabilitation of degraded wastelands.

                The 119th meeting of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes was held on 11th September, 2019 under the Chairmanship of Dr. Nand Kumar Sai to deliberate the issue of inclusion of UT of Ladakh under Fifth/Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India.

At the outset, the full Commission welcomed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act 2019 thereby creating the Union Territory of Ladakh comprising of Kargil and Leh districts.  The Commission feels that this will immensely help in meeting the cherished aspirations of the tribal people in Ladakh region.

The issue was earlier discussed in the 118th Meeting of the Commission held on 27th August, 2019.  This was followed by further consultation with the Ministries of Home Affairs, Tribal Affairs and Law & Justice in a meeting held on 4th September, 2019. 

The Commission took note of the fact that the newly created Union Territory of Ladakh is predominantly a tribal region in the country. The Scheduled Tribe population represent 66.8 percent in Leh, 73.35 percent in Nubra, 97.05 percent in Khalsti, 83.49 per cent in Kargil, 89.96 per cent in Sanku and 99.16 per cent in Zanskar areas of the Ladakh region.The official figures, however, does not include a number of communities including SunniMuslims in the region, who are claiming for Scheduled Tribe status. Taking into account this, the total tribal population in Ladakh region is more than 97 percent. The region is inhabited by following Scheduled Tribes, namely:


	Balti
	Beda
	Bot, Boto
	Brokpa, Drokpa, Dard, Shin
	Changpa
	Garra
	Mon 
	Purigpa.


The Commission noted that prior to creation of Union Territory of Ladakh, people in Ladakh region had certain agrarian rights including right on land which restricted people from other parts of the country to purchase or acquire land in Ladakh.  Similarly, the Ladakh region has several distinct cultural heritages by communities such as Drokpa, Balti and Changpa, among others, which needs to be preserved and promoted.  

The Commission was also informed that in the constitutional scheme of things, the States includes Union Territories in many Parts of the Constitution.  The provisions under paragraph (1) of the Sixth Schedule regarding autonomous districts and autonomous regions states that the tribal areas in each item of Parts I, II and II(A) and in Part-III of the table appended to paragraph 20 of Sixth Schedule shall be an autonomous district. Further, paragraph 21 of the Sixth Schedule empowers Parliament to amend any provisions of the schedule.  The Commission is of the view that the autonomous district councils of erstwhile Union Territory of Mizoram had helped in mitigating the genuine aspirations of people.  Similarly, Clause 3(58)(b) of the General Clauses Act 1897 defines State shall mean a State specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution and shall include a Union Territory.

The Commission after careful consideration, recommends that the Union Territory of Ladakh be brought under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.  The Commission feels that this will help in:

(i) Democratic devolution of powers;

(ii)Preserve and promote distinct culture of the region.

(iii)Protect agrarian rights including rights on land

(iv)Enhance transfer of funds for speedy development of Ladakh region. 

Accordingly, Hon’ble Chairperson, National Commission for Scheduled Tribes has written to Union Home Minister as well as Union Tribal Affairs Minister conveying the recommendation of the Commission to include Union Territory of Ladakh under Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India.

                Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), a flagship scheme of the Government for pregnant women and lactating mothers has achieved a significant milestone by crossing one crore beneficiaries. The total amount disbursed to the beneficiaries under the scheme has crossed 

Rs. 4,000 crores. 

PMMVY is a direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme under which cash benefits are provided to pregnant women in their bank account directly to meet enhanced nutritional needs and partially compensate for wage loss. Implementation of the scheme started with effect from 01.01.2017. Under the ‘Scheme’, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers (PW&LM) receive a cash benefit of Rs. 5,000 in three installments on fulfilling the respective conditionality, viz. early registration of pregnancy, ante-natal check-up and registration of the birth of the child and completion of first cycle of vaccination for the first living child of the family. The eligible beneficiaries also receive cash incentive under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY). Thus, on an average, a woman gets Rs. 6,000. 

Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Rajasthan are the top five States/UT in the country in implementation of PMMVY. Odisha and Telangana are yet to start implementation of the scheme. The Women and Child Development Ministry has recently organized regional workshops with state officials in Guwahati, Jaipur, and Chandigarh to prepare roadmap for faster implementation of the scheme. 

Implementation of the scheme is closely monitored by the central and state governments through PMMVY-CAS, a web based software application. The application is interoperable with UIDAI and Public Financial Management System (PFMS) for authentication of unique beneficiaries and their Bank Accounts. The Scheme is 100 percent Local Government Directory (LGD) compliant with a uniform master data of all villages/towns/cities throughout the Country on one platform, i.e. PMMVY-CAS. These features have helped in quick implementation of the scheme and eliminating duplication of benefits.

She said that this makes it clear that nothing is impossible if the Government and society collectively resolve to achieve a target. The Women and Child Development Minister also mentioned Mahendragarh district of Haryana where the SRB has risen to 916 from below 800 mark in 2001.She also appreciated the work done by the district of Tiruvallur of Tamil Nadu for recording impressive increase of 38 points in SRB from 925 to 963 in the last one year.

She further added that with the collective efforts of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministries of Human Resource Development and Health and Family Welfare the girl child is now protected from birth till the rest of her life.   

Minister of State of WCD, Debasree Chaudhuri, in her address, stressed on the need for more concrete steps to further improve the skewed child sex ratio. She said that the success of BBBP scheme largely depends on the committed participation of State governments, district administrations and the active support of community members. She appealed to every citizen to become a part of the social change programme of BBBP in order to end discrimination against the girl child and strive harder to create a girl child friendly environment. 

Secretary WCD in his welcome address gave a detailed outline of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme.     

A slide show of innovations for implementation of the BBBP scheme by States/ Districts was shown followed by short videos of innovative interventions undertaken by the winning states and districts.

The BBBP scheme was launched on 22nd January,2015. It is being implemented in 640 districts and all districts are covered through advocacy and media campaign. Out of these districts, 405 are covered under Multi-Sectoral Intervention in which 100% Centrally Sponsored Scheme grant is provided directly to the District Magistrate/District Collector for BBBP.

The latest reports on State/UT-wise SRB data for the period 2014-15 and 2018-19, shows an improving trend at the national level in SRB from 918 to 931.

                Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports (I/C) Shri Kiren Rijijuwill flag off Fit India Plog Run on the occasion of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The Plog run has brought together athletes, Bollywood actors,school chains, corporates, municipal corporations, industry bodies andindividuals.Speaking about the enthusiasm of all sections of the society to join in the initiative towards a fitter, cleanercountry, the Ministerhas said, ""It is very encouraging to see the interest that the Fit India Plog Run has generated. Honourable PM's vision is set to be executedon the ground on October 2. However, the Plog Run is just the beginning of a movement that will become a part of the life of every Indian, and with support from all groups and institutions, I am confident this will turn into a big people's movement.""

Students of more than 1196 Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan Schools will be plogging across all states of India, students of 581 South Delhi Municipality Schools will clean up the Delhi’s southern part and members from 2500 Resident Welfare Associations will clean up Delhi-NCR. Corporate chains like Cult Fit, Sports Leagues like the Ultimate Table Tennis league, all top chambers of commerce, including FICCI, CII, Phd Chambers and Assocham are joining in to plog across the country. Noida Authority alone is having 100 plog runs within Noida on October 2, for a cleaner city. Nehru Yuva Kendras, NSS centers and government and private institutions across the country are also organising the Plog Run to ensure that fitness and cleanliness become a way of life for people. 

Speaking on the how the KVs are preparing for the event, Shri Santosh Kumar Mall, Commissioner, Kendriya Vidalaya Sangathan has said, ""We have had a special parent teacher meet to explain the concept of plogging to parents. This has helped to motivate them to send their kids on October 2 for the Fit India Plog Run and many are enthused to join in themselves.""

Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a clarion call to the nation, asking every Indian citizen to combine fitness and cleanliness in their lives through Plogging in his Mann Ki Baat address broadcast on 29th September,2019. In his address the PM said, “The sports ministry is organizing the Fit India Plog Run on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu. This initiative starts from October 2 and all of us must ensure that we all jog for 2 kilometers and also pick up waste along the way. By doing this, not only will we take care of our own health, but the health of Mother Earth too.”Lauding the concept of Plogging, PM spoke to Plogger Ripu Daman Behlvi in his Radio broadcast of Mann Ki Baat, who introduced the concept to his running group in Delhi 5 years back, and then took it around the country. Since September 5, he is plogging around the country and will complete his plog on October 2, 2019 in Mumbai. Ripu Daman will also join the Fit India Plog Run in Delhi.

Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS) under Department of Youth Affairs of MoYAS has taken up an initiative on preparing Disaster Response Teams (DRTs) of NYKS Youth Volunteers for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in collaboration with National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). It is proposed to establish institutional mechanism for organized and structured engagement of NYKS by creating Block Level Disaster Response Teams (DRTs) of volunteers as first responders in NDRF selected hazard prone districts. It is also proposed to cover such districts in India in a phased manner in collaboration with NDRF, State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMA) and District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMA).

 



 

Any disaster requires a quick response to save lives, contain the damage and prevent any secondary disasters. Affected community is always the “First Responder”. In most instances, this takes place spontaneously, outside any organized setting. Volunteers from the community play a vital role in immediate response to any disaster. National Disaster Response Force, State Disaster Response Force and other orgnised services including police, fire services etc. take some time to reach the disaster sites.  In the meantime, volunteer groups not only provide initial rescue and relief services, but also act as link between the affected community and institutions arriving at the scene, thus strengthening response by the government actors. Volunteers also work as “force multiplier” particularly when the  emergenccy services have to be reached to the remotest affected community.

 

Initially, institutional mechanism for organized and structured engagement of NYKS by creating Block Level Disaster Response Teams (DRTs) of volunteers as first responders is going to be on a pilot basis in 32 multi-hazard Districts of 28 States/UTs. Further, 295 blocks have been selected in districts across India. 30 young volunteers are to be selected from each block. Around 8,850 volunteers will thus be trained through 6 days customised training at 12 battalions of NDRF during the year 2019-2020. An MoU between NYKS and NDRF regarding the initiative and to progressively increase the number of NYKS Youth Volunteers for the next five years has been developed. It is expected to train more than 50,000 youth associated with NYKS till the year 2024.

 

A video conference was organised by NDRF and NYKS with State Directors of 28 States and District Youth Coordinators of 32 Districts on 9th August, 2019 to brief them about the initiative and how to go about the project. A One Day Workshop for SDs and DYCs of NYKS was successfully conducted in Ghaziabad on 19th August, 2019 in which detailed discussion was held between the stakeholders in order to infuse in them the sense of responsibility required to carry out this project as a motivator and leader in their respective States/Districts.

 



 

The first training Batches of DRTs of NYKS Youth Volunteers for Disaster Risk Reduction training has commenced from 02nd September, 2019 and will continue till 07th September 2019. 13 Districts’ Nehru Yuva Kendras have sent 30 youth volunteers each. Around 390 volunteers which include more than 100 female participants are attending the training programs. The trained NYKS Youth Volunteers will work as DRTs and will be called as ‘NDRF- friends’. An online database is being created by registering the volunteers on NYKS portal and the data will be shared with NDMA/SDMA/DDMA for future communication with the volunteers.    

 

A comprehensive course has been prepared by NDRF including topics like Basic Search and Rescue, patient assessment, BLS & CPR, Snake Biting, Fire safety, group exercises, etc. The training will consist of both theoretical and practical sessions so as to build the capacity and confidence of volunteers to act as first responders to a disaster in their respective area. Feedbacks will be taken by NYKS from these trained volunteers to further improve the training programme.   

 

Each concerned NYKS District Youth Coordinator will prepare an Action Plan in consultation with DDMA and approval of concerned DM for continued community level engagement of trained volunteers which would include deployment of trained volunteers in the District Control Rooms/Emergency Operation Centres, normal time DRR and other activities; undertaking mock drills at local levels; generating DRR awareness amongst village communities; peer education; addressing Gram Sabha meetings on DRR; encourage participation in events such as 26th January Parade etc. A close monitoring of complete training programme will be done by both NYKS and NDRF to improvise the programme in future.

 



 

Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan is the largest grassroot level youth organization, of its kind in the world. It channelizes the power of youth on the principles of voluntarism, self-help and community participation. Over the years, NYKS has established a network of youth volunteers through its 623 District Kendras. It has played a major role in implementing various flagship schemes of the Government.

                School Education Quality Index (SEQI) was developed by NITI Aayog to evaluate the performance of States and Union Territories (UTs) in the school education sector. The index aims to bring an ‘outcomes’ focus to education policy by providing States and UTs with a platform to identify their strengths and weaknesses and undertake requisite course corrections or policy interventions. 



The first edition of SEQI was released today by Dr Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog, in the presence of NITI Aayog Member Dr Vinod Paul, CEO Mr Amitabh Kant and Ms Rina Ray, Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource and Development and representatives from the World Bank. 



In line with NITI Aayog’s mandate to foster the spirit of competitive and cooperative federalism, SEQI strives to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices across States and UTs. Developed through a collaborative process, including key stakeholders such as Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), the World Bank and sector experts, the index consists of 30 critical indicators that assess the delivery of quality education. These indicators are categorized as below:

Category 1: Outcomes


	
	
		Domain 1: Learning outcomes
		Domain 2: Access outcomes
		Domain 3: Infrastructure and facilities for outcomes
		Domain 4: Equity outcomes
	
	


Category 2: Governance processes aiding outcomes

Schooling should result in successful learning outcomes. A credible system of assessment in this regard is crucial to design necessary remedial actions. To ensure the system is geared towards learning, SEQI assigns almost half its weight to learning outcomes. This sends a strong signal across the nation to ensure the focus remains centred on learning outcomes.

To facilitate a like-for-like comparison, States and UTs have been grouped as Large States, Small States and UTs. Within each of these groups, the indicator values have been appropriately scaled, normalized and weighted to generate an overall performance score and ranking for each State and UT. 

States’ overall performance may hide variations in their performance on the underlying categories. Of the 20 Large States, 10 perform better on the Outcomes category, with the most noticeable performance differences observed in the cases of Karnataka, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh. The other Large States perform better on the Governance Processes Aiding Outcomes category, with the most noticeable performance differences observed in the cases of Odisha, Punjab and Haryana.

Of the eight Small States, seven perform better on the Outcomes category, with the most noticeable performance differences observed in the cases of Manipur, Tripura and Goa. Sikkim is the only Small State that performs better on the Governance Processes Aiding Outcomes category.

Of the seven UTs, four perform better on the Outcomes category, with the most noticeable performance differences observed in Dadra & Nagar Haveli. Delhi, Daman & Diu and Lakshadweep perform better on the Governance Processes Aiding Outcomes category

States’ and UTs’ performance on Learning Outcomes is driven by their results on the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017. Their performance on Access Outcomes is primarily driven by enrolment ratios at the secondary level and transition rates from upper-primary to secondary level. In terms of Infrastructure & Facilities for Outcomes, States’ and UTs’ performance is strongly linked to the presence of Computer Aided-Learning (CAL) at the elementary level and vocational education at the secondary and senior-secondary level.

Among the 20 Large States, 18 improved their overall performance between 2015-16 and 2016-17. The average improvement in these 18 states is 8.6 percentage points although there is a lot of variation around that average in terms of the fastest and slowest improving States. Due to this variation, many States that improved their overall performance score still show a decline in rank.

Five Small States have shown an improvement in their overall performance score between 2015-16 and 2016-17, with the average improvement being around nine percentage points. However, as in the case of Large States, there is considerable variation between the fastest and slowest improving States. States such as Meghalaya, Nagaland and Goa outpaced the others, improving by 14.1, 13.5 and 8.2 percentage points respectively, thus improving their ranks in the process.

All seven UTs have shown an improvement in their overall performance scores. The average improvement is 9.5 percentage points. Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Puducherry improved their overall performance scores by 16.5, 15.0 and 14.3 percentage points respectively, which enabled them to improve their ranking on incremental performance.

SEQI also included an analysis of States and Union Territories for each indicator under study. For instance, indicators such as average score in Class 3, 5 and 8 for Language and Mathematics, Transition Rates from primary to upper-primary level, capturing equity in learning outcomes between general and marginalised sections of society, supply a wealth of data for future action and policy design for every State. 

States and UTs are ranked on their overall performance in the reference year 2016-17, as well as on their annual incremental performance (difference in the overall performance) between the reference year and base year (2015-16). The rankings present incredible insights on the status of school education across States/UTs and their relative progress over time. 

A brief snapshot of the top and bottom performing States and Union Territories is as follows. The detailed report can be accessed at: http://social.niti.gov.in/

SEQI is envisioned as a dynamic instrument that will continue to evolve. Over time, the relevance of the existing indicators and the availability of data for new indicators will be factored into the index design. In particular, the linkages between policy actions and SEQI indicators will be analyzed to reflect the efforts made by States and UTs to improve school education.

                With Government of India working towards a Divyangjan-friendly nation, participants of San-Sadhan Hackathon, organized by Ministry of Jal Shakti and the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) in association with Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), NITI Aayog came out with thought-provoking ideas for accessible toilets for Divyangjans. 

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister for Jal Shakti Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said that his ministry is working day in and out towards providing better toilet facilities to divyangjans. 

“An important aspect of complete Swachhata is inclusion. Our department envisages equitable and inclusive access to sanitation facilities for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), as an integral aspect of their empowerment to lead a life with dignity,” he said. 

He added that the present government has understood the gravity of the issues faced by the Divyangjans and is working hard towards making their lives easy. “We must encourage our youth to come forward and solve issues that are of national concern,” he asserted.

Expressing his views on the remarkable work done by the winners, CEO NITI Aayog Shri Amitabh Kant said that India, through its young innovators is capable to create an unparalleled ecosystem of solutions to world problems. 

“I firmly believe that when our young people innovate for India, they contribute to solving global issues. Our youth are capable to lead the path toward an inclusive India and I am happy to see them having done a wonderful job at Sansadhan hackathon. I congratulate the participants as well as winners for their thought-provoking ideas,” Shri Kant Added. 

Secretary to Government, Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities Ms. Shakuntala D. Gamlin said “Rural toilets must be accessible for Divyangjan. A prototype of such a model that would be affordable, accessible and scalable is the need of the hour.”

Similarly, Secretary to Government, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation Shri Parameswaran Iyer said ""We have seen some excellent innovations today, and these may be very effective in making our sanitation facilities even more Divyang friendly. I congratulate all the teams for addressing this very important challenge and I am confident that many of these innovations will go to scale.”

In his welcome address, Mission Director AIM Shri R Ramanan said that “It was AIM’s privilege to partner with ministries in organizing San-Sadhan Hackathon, towards a much needed initiative to empower the Divyangjan leveraging India’s innovation capabilities.”

The three day long Sansadhan hackathon is the latest initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), aiming to set up accessible toilets for Divyangjan. 

The participants competed in four categories which included Rural Individual Use Toilet, Rural Community Use Toilet, Urban Individual Use Toilet and Urban Community Use Toilet. The winners were given cash awards and piloting opportunities in the field across the country under SBM.

Three innovators emerged as winners and one as a runner up out of 21 applications which were shortlisted from a total of over 130 teams who had applied for the hackathon.

                The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Smt Nirmala Sitaraman made path breaking announcements today by revising the corporate tax rate downward and altering the percentage and application of Minimum Alternate Tax in certain cases. She has also taken measures to stabilize and enhance the flow of funds into the capital market and broadened the scope of CSR funding. EAC-PM has welcomed these comprehensive measures. These are important steps which will boost investment and enhance India’s economic growth. The Finance Minister has given an option to corporations to choose between reduced tax rates and prevailing exemptions. The Council feels that an even lower tax rate of 15% for companies making fresh investments in the coming months is bound to trigger new investments which will further augment India’s GDP. This augmentation will counterbalance the revenue that will be foregone.

Today’s announcements, that are part of the series of measures taken by the Government to revive economic sentiment will go a long way in helping India realise its full economic potential.

Saudi Aramco is primarily engaged in the exploration, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas. It is also active, to a lesser extent, in the production and marketing of refined products and petrochemicals. In India, Saudi Aramco is mainly active in the supply of crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, base oil and petrochemical products.

SABIC is primarily active in the production and sale of commodity chemicals (including petrochemicals), intermediates, polymers, fertilizers and to some extent metals. In India, SABIC is mainly active in the supply of agri-nutrient and petrochemical products.

 

Detailed order of the Commission will follow.
