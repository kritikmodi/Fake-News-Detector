                Honourable Members, 

  1.   I am pleased to address the joint sitting of Parliament at the start of the third decade of 21st century. I once again extend my best wishes for the New Year and congratulate all Members of Parliament for being a witness to this historic occasion.

  2.   This decade is extremely important for India. In this decade, we will complete 75 years of our independence. In this decade, we all have to work together with new energy to give impetus to the making of a new India. With the efforts of my Government, a strong foundation has been laid in the last five years, to make this decade India’s decade and this century India’s century.

  3.   Whether it is Pujya Bapu’s dream of Gram Swaraj, Babasaheb Ambedkar’s principle of social justice, Nehru ji’s dream of creating a modern India, Sardar Patel’s resolve for Ek Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’s goal of Antyodaya, Lohia ji’s vision of social equality, we the people of India will together make these dreams a reality.

Honourable Members, 

  4.   The Constitution of India is the guiding light for all of us in fulfilling these dreams. Just a few weeks ago, on 26th November, 70 years of the Constitution have been completed. On that day, 12 crore citizens of the country, publicly read out the Preamble of the Constitution and renewed their commitment to the Constitution.

  5.   In addition, to protecting the rights of every citizen of our country, our Constitution makes the citizens of the country mindful of their duties. Further, our Constitution also places an expectation that the decisions taken through democratic processes will be accepted by the countrymen. At the same time, our Constitution expects the Parliament and every member present in this House to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the countrymen and make the necessary laws, keeping the national interest paramount.

Honourable Members, 

  6.   I am happy that in the last 7 months, Parliament has set new standards in conducting its business. The performance during the first session of this Lok Sabha has set a new record in the last seven decades.

  7.   Due to my Government’s strong commitment, the law against Triple Talaq ensuring justice to Muslim women and safeguarding their rights; the Consumer Protection Act providing new rights to the citizens; the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act  for protecting the savings of the poor; the Chit Funds Amendment  Act protecting  the poor from fraudulent  chit fund schemes; the law enhancing punishment for sexual offences against children; Motor Vehicles Amendment Act aimed at reducing road accidents; and the law protecting the rights of the transgender persons - several such historic legislations have been enacted.

  8.   I congratulate every Member of Parliament for fulfilling this Constitutional responsibility.  

Honourable Members,

  9.   The faith reposed by the people of our country in our democratic institutions strengthens the foundation of our democracy. The maturity displayed by the countrymen after the Supreme Court’s verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi is also laudable. My Government is of the firm view that mutual discussions and debates strengthen democracy. At the same time, any kind of violence in the name of protests weakens the society and the nation.

Honourable Members,

10.   In a democracy, nothing is more sacred than the mandate given by the people. The people of the country have given this mandate to my Government for the making of a new India. 


	A new India which takes pride in the glory of our ancient culture and which enriches the 21st century world with the power of its knowledge. 
	A new India, in which besides finding solutions to old problems, new chapters of development are written. 
	A new India, in which adequate facilities and new opportunities for growth are available for the poor, dalits, women, youth, tribals and minorities. 
	A new India, where every region develops, no region is left behind, where the benefits of modern technology reach the farthest end of society, and 
	A new India, which is at the forefront of the fourth industrial revolution and which attains new heights at the global stage. 


Honourable Members,

11.   For making such a new India and for fulfilling the expectations of the people, my Government is working with commendable pace and decisiveness to bring about changes in every field. It is the outcome of reforms at the grassroot level ushered in by the Government in the last five years that there has been an unprecedented improvement in India’s global ranking in several areas.

12.  In the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings, India has leapfrogged to the 63rd position, moving up by 79 places. In the Resolving Insolvency rankings, India has moved from 108th to 52nd position and in the Global Innovation rankings, from 74th to 52nd position. India has improved its international ranking by 10 points in the Logistics Performance Index. India has moved from 52nd to 34th position in the World Economic Forum’s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness rankings.

13.   These reforms in diverse areas are also a call to the international community to see how India has strengthened its foundations in the last 5-6 years and how keen the people of India are to build a new India.

Honourable Members,

14.   My Government is following the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’, and is working with full commitment and sincerity. Free gas connections to 8 crore poor, houses to 2 crore poor, bank accounts to about 38 crore poor, free treatment facility of up to Rs 5 lakh to 50 crore people, insurance cover to 24 crore people and free electricity connections to over 2.5 crore people have been provided; with complete transparency and without any discrimination. My Government has provided equitable access to benefits and facilities of its schemes for the poor people; of all religions and all regions, and has, thus, earned the trust of the people of the country.

Honourable Members,

15.   Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the great son of Bengal and the Minister of Industry in the Government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru Ji, had said in the Lok Sabha: “In a democratic federal state, the fundamental rights of the citizens of one constituent unit cannot vary vis-à-vis the citizens of another unit. Are not the people of Jammu and Kashmir entitled to the fundamental rights that we have given to the people of India minus Jammu and Kashmir?”

16.   Today, after seven decades, the whole country is happy that the dream of crores of freedom fighters including Dr. Mukherjee has come true and the people of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh, the dalits and women from that area have also got the same rights as the people in the rest of the country. The abrogation  of Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution by two-thirds majority in  both the Houses of Parliament is not only historic but has also paved the way for equitable development of Jammu - Kashmir and Ladakh. Through this House, I heartily congratulate the people of Jammu - Kashmir and Ladakh for joining the mainstream of development.

Honourable Members,

17.   Rapid development of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh, preservation of their culture and traditions, transparent and honest administration and democratic empowerment are among the priorities of my Government. During the President’s Rule and since becoming a Union Territory, all the developmental projects in Jammu - Kashmir and Ladakh have gained momentum.

18.   Towards the end of the year 2018, elections in more than 4,400 panchayats of Jammu -Kashmir were conducted in a peaceful manner. For the first time since independence, elections to more than 300 Block Development Councils have also been held there. The people there are now getting full benefits under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjwala Yojana, Ayushman Yojana, Ujala Yojana, DBT and food subsidy, in a transparent manner. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, while around 3,500 houses were built in Jammu - Kashmir till March 2018, in less than two years thereafter, construction of more than 24,000 houses has been completed.

19.   Apart from this, works relating to connectivity, irrigation, hospitals, schemes related to tourism and establishment of institutes of higher education such as IIT, IIM, AIIMS are also proceeding at a rapid pace in Jammu -Kashmir and Ladakh. NAFED has been entrusted with the responsibility for the direct procurement of apples in Jammu - Kashmir. This has especially benefited the apple growers of Kashmir Valley.

Honourable Members,

20.   The success of the public welfare schemes of my Government and the historic decisions taken by the Government have increased the expectations of the countrymen, as well as the responsibilities of the Government.

21.   For many years, the people of the country desired that they should be able to pay their respects at Kartarpur Sahib with ease. My Government has built the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor in record time, and dedicated it to the nation on the occasion of 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It is a privilege for my Government to have got the opportunity to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji with full veneration, within the country and abroad. The 400th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji will also be celebrated in a befitting manner with full grandeur and devotion by my Government.

Honourable Members,

22.   Over 40 lakh people living in the capital city of Delhi, had been living for many years in the hope that one day they would get the ownership rights of their homes and that they will be able to lead a dignified life. The Government has fulfilled this long awaited expectation of people living in more than 1,700 colonies of Delhi.

23.   Farmers, agricultural labourers, unorganized sector labourers and small traders of the country had expectations of a pension scheme that would be of help to them in their old age. My Government has not only fulfilled their wish, but also has covered about 60 lakh beneficiaries so far, under these pension schemes.

24.   Pujya Bapu always considered cleanliness next to Godliness. On the occasion of Gandhi ji’s 150th birth anniversary, on 2 October last year, rural areas of the country have paid a befitting tribute to the Father of the Nation by declaring themselves free from open defecation. Now it is incumbent on all of us to make our cities and villages even more clean and beautiful in the coming decade.

Honourable Members,

25.   Even today, there are about 15 crore houses without piped water supply in rural areas of the country. Our sisters and daughters face the maximum hardship due to lack of water supply in the house. Further, contaminated water adversely impacts the health of the entire family. In order to ensure the availability of sufficient quantity of potable drinking water to each rural household in the country, my Government has launched the Jal Jeevan Mission. Central Government, all State Governments, local bodies and voluntary organizations are working together to transform this Mission into a people’s movement. In the coming days Rs 3 lakh 60 thousand crore will be spent on this scheme. My Government has launched the Atal Bhujal Yojana with special focus on seven of the most vulnerable States of the country, where ground water level is depleting rapidly. 

Honourable Members,

26.   My Government’s mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas is meant for every citizen and for every region and every State of the country. My Government believes that just as advancement of a person on the margins of society should be given high priority, the development of the areas left behind should also receive greater attention.

27.   By according 112 districts the status of Aspirational Districts, the Government is paying special attention to each scheme relating to development of the poor living there. State Governments have also positioned the right mix of experienced and youthful officers in these districts. As a result, there has been impressive improvement in several development indicators in these districts and many districts have now come close to their State average. I congratulate and convey my best wishes to the team of each Aspirational District through this House.

Honourable Members,

28.   More than the physical distance of the North East from Delhi, it was the emotional disconnect that disheartened the people of the region. My Government has transformed this situation by working tirelessly during the last five years. Work is being done at an unprecedented pace in the North East to enhance connectivity, strengthen infrastructure and make people’s lives easier. As a result of these efforts of the Government, by 2022, the capitals of Sikkim, Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland will be connected to the rail network. The work on Agartala-Akhaura rail link is also progressing at a fast pace. In the year 2022, the construction of the new airport being built at ‘Holongi’ in Arunachal Pradesh will also be completed.

29.   Besides this, construction of AIIMS in Guwahati, bio-refinery in Numaligarh and sports university in Manipur are also progressing at a fast pace. Recently, the Government has sanctioned about Rs 9,000 crore for the North East Gas Grid Project. This project will lay the foundation of a Gas Based Economy in all the 8 States of the North East.

30.   The Central and Assam Governments have recently signed a historic agreement with the Bodo Organizations to bring an end to the 5 decade-old Bodo dispute.  With this agreement, a complex problem, that has claimed more than 4000 lives, has been resolved.  After this agreement, the Government will spend Rs1500 crore for the development of Bodo community.  Similarly, another landmark agreement between Tripura, Mizoram, the Central Government and the Bru community has not only resolved a decades-old problem but has also ensured a secure life for thousands of people belonging to the Bru community.

Honourable Members,

31.   My Government is committed to bringing the brothers and sisters from the tribal community of the country into the mainstream of development. For the first time, Government has extended the benefit of MSP to forest produce. My Government’s special emphasis is on the health, education and skill development of the tribals. Only a few weeks ago, the Government has launched a programme for opening more than 400 Eklavya Model Residential Schools in the country. Recently, reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies has also been extended for the next ten years.

Honourable Members,

32.   My Government is also constantly striving for the social, economic and educational progress of the minority community. Through Hunar Haat, employment opportunities have been provided to 2 lakh 65 thousand skilled artisans belonging to the minority community. Scholarships have been granted in large numbers to Muslim students to enable them to continue their education without interruption.

33.   On the special request of my Government, an unprecedented increase in Haj quota was made by Saudi Arabia as a result of which a record 2 lakh Indian Muslims performed the Haj this time. India is the first country where the entire process of Haj pilgrimage has been made digital and online. The Government is also undertaking 100 percent digitization of Waqf properties across the country so that these properties can be utilised for the welfare of the Muslim community.

Honourable Members,

34.   My Government is working with utmost sensitivity towards fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the divyangjan. Along with increase in reservations and legal empowerment, more than 1000 Government buildings and more than 700 railway stations have been made accessible for divyangjan. In the last 5 years, aids and assistive devices worth Rs 900 crore were distributed to the divyangjan by organising camps. The Government is creating a national database of divyangjan and e-Unique Identification Cards have been issued to more than 25 lakh divyangjan. My Government, in its previous term, had undertaken a special initiative for preparing the Indian Sign Language Dictionary. It gives me pleasure to inform the House that a special dictionary of 6 thousand words has been prepared.

Honourable Members,

35.   India has always believed in the principle of equal respect for all faiths. However, at the time of Partition, this very belief of India and of its people came under the most severe attack. In the environment prevailing in the aftermath of partition, the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi had said: “Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan, who do not wish to live there, can come to India. It is the duty of the Government of India to ensure a normal life for them.” Many national leaders and political parties have from time to time supported this idea of Pujya Bapu and further propagated it. It is our responsibility to honour this wish of the founding fathers of our nation. I am happy that both the Houses of Parliament have fulfilled this wish, by enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act. At a time when the country is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi ji, all of you have given paramount consideration to this sentiment. I congratulate both the Houses of Parliament and all the MPs for this.

Honourable Members,

36.   We have all been witness to the increase in the atrocities on minorities in Pakistan over time. We have all seen what happened in Nankana Sahib recently. It is the responsibility of all of us to bring the atrocities being committed in Pakistan to the notice of the global community. 

37.   While condemning the atrocities on the minorities in Pakistan, I urge the world community to take cognizance of it and take necessary steps in this regard.

Honourable Members,

38.   My Government would like to clarify once again that the procedures which have existed for people from all faiths of the world who believe in India and who wish to obtain Indian citizenship, remain unchanged. A person of any faith can follow these processes and become a citizen of India. The Government has made several provisions to ensure that granting citizenship to those who have been compelled to take shelter in India does not have any adverse cultural impact on any region, especially the North East.

39. Honourable Members,

       The great saint poet of India, Thiruvalluvar had said -

        ‘Urruvar Ulgattaark AaniyaTattraad, Erru-vaare Ellaam Porutt’

        That is, “Like a linchpin of an axle, a farmer holds together the entire world. He bears the burden of those people who cannot cultivate land.”

40.   Our country is indebted to our farmers who are our annadata, because of whose hard work we are self-reliant in foodgrain. Bringing about a change in the lives of farmers who serve the country selflessly and development of rural areas, are the priorities of my Government. The Government is going to spend an amount of Rs 25 lakh crore in the coming years to strengthen the rural economy. Government is working on a strategy to develop an income centric system aimed at doubling the income of farmers.

Honourable Members,

41.   Under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi, more than Rs 43 thousand crore has been deposited in the bank accounts of more than 8 crore farmer families. On 2nd January this month, my Government has created a record by transferring Rs 12 thousand crore to the bank accounts of 6 crore farmers simultaneously.

42.   My Government is working with dedication to provide the farmers, prices which are one and a half times the input cost. Steady increase in MSP for Kharif and Rabi crops is a step in this direction. Due to the efforts of the Government the procurement of pulses and oilseeds has increased by more than 20 times.

Honourable Members,

43.   My Government is also promoting alternative farming practices. Along with cluster-based horticulture, organic farming is also being promoted and propagated. The production of honey has increased by about 60 per cent due to the efforts made by the Government in this area. The export of honey has also more than doubled.  In order to build further on this accomplishment, the National Bee-Keeping and Honey Mission has been approved.

44.   The twin objectives of doubling the fishermen’s income and fish production are sought to be achieved through the newly created Department of Fisheries. A massive drive is being organized with the aim of ensuring the health of more than 50 crore livestock of the country. Under the National Animal Disease Control Programme, an amount of Rs 13 thousand crore is being spent on immunization and other measures to protect the cattle from Foot and Mouth Disease.

Honourable Members,

45.   My Government along with the State Governments is working with sensitivity to provide relief to farmers from natural calamities. Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, on an average, every year, more than five and a half crore farmers are availing crop insurance cover at a very low premium. Under this scheme in the last three years, claims of farmers to the tune of Rs 57 thousand crore have been settled.

46.   The impact of e-NAM, the online national market for farmers has also started becoming visible. 1 crore 65 lakh farmers and about 1 lakh 25 thousand traders of the country have been linked to it. About Rs 90 thousand crore worth of business has been transacted through this platform. In order to further enhance the effectiveness of e-NAM in this decade, work is underway to link more than 400 new mandis with it.

Honourable Members,

47.   The health of an individual has impact on the development of both the family and the country. My Government is working with a holistic approach in the area of health. Serious efforts are being made at every level in preventive and curative healthcare. Many schemes such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jal Jeevan Mission, Poshan Abhiyan, Fit India Movement, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, are contributing to improving the health of the people.

48.   The wide ranging impact of the Ayushman Bharat Scheme on the health sector of the country is visible. Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, so far 75 lakh poor have availed free treatment. More than 27 thousand Health and Wellness Centres have also been set up. 

Honourable Members,

49.   Due to the decisions taken by my Government, medical expenses of the poor and the middle class have been reduced considerably. Capping of prices of more than 1000 essential medicines has resulted in a saving of Rs 12,500 crore for the patients. Reduced cost of stents and knee-implants has provided huge relief to lakhs of patients. Every day 5 to 7 lakh patients are now purchasing medicines for serious ailments at affordable prices from more than 6,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras.

50.   By setting up the National Medical Commission, my Government has reaffirmed its commitment to reform medical education and healthcare. 75 new medical colleges have been sanctioned this year, which will result in an increase in MBBS seats by about 16 thousand and PG seats by more than 4 thousand. In addition, 22 AIIMS have been sanctioned for various parts of the country, construction work for which is in progress.

51.   My Government is also making special efforts to improve the health of women. Under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, about Rs 5 thousand crore has been transferred by the Government directly to the bank accounts of 1 crore 20 lakh women of the country. Under Mission Indradhanush,  3 crore 50 lakh infants and about 90 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated. Benefits of these schemes are particularly visible in areas inhabited by dalits and tribals. My Government has also started making oxo-biodegradable sanitary napkins ‘Suvidha’ available for just one rupee.

Honourable Members,

52.   Because of the efforts of my Government to promote entrepreneurship and livelihood for women, more than 6 crore 60 lakh women have already joined the Self Help Group movement. These women are being provided credit at low interest rates. In order to provide equal opportunities, for the first time women have been allowed to work during the night shift also in both under-ground and open cast mines. It is with this same objective of promoting gender equality that admission of girls has been permitted in Sainik Schools for the first time. Appointment of women in the Military Police is also underway. For the first time the Indian Air Force is providing new opportunities for women to work in the fighter stream and as defence attachés.

Honourable Members,

53.   My Government is working with sensitivity for ensuring the safety of women.  In order to enhance women’s safety, more than 600 One Stop Centers have been set up in the country. A national database has been created to identify the perpetrators of crimes against women. More than 1 thousand Fast Track Special Courts will be set up across the country to ensure speedy justice in such cases. It has also been decided to set up a Women Help Desk in every police station of the country. For heinous crimes like sexual offence against children, Government has made a provision even for capital punishment.

Honourable Members,

54.   The 21st century is referred to as the Century of Knowledge and the priority of the Government is to prepare the youth to provide leadership in this field. In the areas related to Research, Innovation, Incubation and Start-Ups, it is the youth who will be at the forefront in this decade. The youth are benefitting continuously from the policy decisions taken by my Government in this regard. Today, India is home to the world’s third largest start-up ecosystem. Under the Start-Up India campaign, recognition has been accorded to 27 thousand new start-ups in the country. The number of patents granted in the country has increased four times in the last five years, whereas trademark registrations have increased five-fold.

55.   Through the Skill India Mission and National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme, along with skill development the youth are also being provided with necessary funds for self-employment. More than 5 crore 54 lakh new entrepreneurs in the country have availed loans under the Mudra scheme. So far, credit in excess of Rs 10 lakh crore has been sanctioned under this scheme.

Honourable Members,

56.   My Government is laying emphasis on schemes aimed at improving quality of education and promoting innovation. More than Rs 37 thousand crore has been sanctioned for modernization of 75 educational institutions in the country through the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA). Government has initiated action for appointment of about 7 thousand teachers in Kendriya Vidyalayas and 12 thousand teachers in Higher Education Institutions. ‘Swayam2’ has also been introduced by the Government to strengthen the online education system.

57.   I am delighted to inform you that for the first time ever in the history of the country, number of girls admitted in higher education has exceeded that of boys.

Honourable Members,

58.   Our youth have the potential to transform India into a great sporting power in the world. Under various schemes, including the Khelo India programme and the Olympic Podium Scheme, young talent is being identified and provided with requisite training to compete at the highest level. The third phase of Khelo India programme has been successfully concluded in Guwahati just a few days back. It is worth noting that 80 new national records were set there, of which 56 were set by women.

Honourable Members,

59.   This year 1st August marks the hundredth death anniversary of the great freedom fighter, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who had given the clarion call that Swaraj is our birth right. After attainment of Swaraj, the nation has now started moving towards Suraaj. Moving rapidly towards the goal of Suraaj, my Government is working at three levels:


	First – Transforming the work culture in Government and strengthening institutions,
	Second - Use of modern technology to promote transparency,
	And third - promoting healthy competition and public participation at the grassroot level.


Honourable Members,

60.   Following the fundamental principle of “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance”, several reforms have been undertaken by the Government. With its recent abolition of 58 more laws, the number of laws abolished by the Government has now reached about 1500. Reforms in recruitment process for every level are underway in order to promote transparency. The youth are benefitting from the decision to discontinue interviews for most of the Group B posts and Group C posts.

Honourable Members,

61.   Coordination among Departments and dismantling of silos are absolutely essential for successful implementation of schemes. In this direction, organization of a common Foundation Course for officers of more than 20 Civil Services in October last year is an important step. Recently, the management of Indian Railways has also been restructured. To make the functioning of various Tribunals in the country more effective, the Tribunal system too is being reformed. New Ministries have also been created to facilitate better target orientation of schemes. Creation of the Ministry of Skill Development and the Ministry of Jal Shakti by the Government is an example of this thought process.

Honourable Members,

62.   Fast and accurate delivery of Government services and benefits has been the hallmark of my Government. This has been made possible by application of technology as a basis of good governance on an unprecedented scale. Identification of beneficiaries in a transparent manner, transfer of 100 per cent assistance directly to bank accounts of beneficiaries and use of modern technology in monitoring of schemes have made the lives of the poor and the middle class easier. This technology will also help in improving the quality of life of our countrymen during this decade.

Honourable Members,

63.   We are all aware that digital technology is the foundation of the Industrial Revolution Industry 4.0. My Government has focused on Digital Access, Digital Inclusion and Digital Empowerment in an unparalleled manner through the Digital India Programme in order to take full advantage of the Industrial Revolution in the 21st century. It is a matter of pride for the country that digital systems developed in India during the last five years have been a source of inspiration for several countries of the world.

Honourable Members,

64.   Today, more than 121 crore people in the country have Aadhaar cards and about 60 crore people possess RuPay cards. A record value of Rs 2 lakh crore has been transacted through UPI in December 2019. Recently, the Government has also launched a new version of the BHIM App.

65.   The Government has linked about 450 schemes to Direct Benefit Transfer or DBT by using the JAM Trinity of Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile. An amount of over Rs 9 lakh crore has been directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT, during the last 5 years. By plugging the leakages, my Government has saved about Rs 1 lakh 70 thousand crore from going into the wrong hands.

66.   The Government e-Marketplace, GeM has brought about transparency in Government procurement. GeM has not only opened up a huge market, in the form of the Government, for the small and micro entrepreneurs, it has also connected the Government directly with the entrepreneurs. During the last three years, about Rs 40 thousand crore worth of procurement has been done by different Government Departments through GeM.

67.   By leveraging technology, my Government has taken several major steps to end the Inspector Raj. Now we are also developing a system in the Income Tax Department which would be devoid of any human interface. This system will increase transparency and improve work culture in the tax department.

Honourable Members,

68.   Technology plays a major role in bringing cities and villages closer. So far, more than 1 lakh 25 thousand Gram Panchayats have been connected with high speed broadband under the BharatNet scheme. In 2014, there were 60 thousand Common Service Centres in rural areas of the country, which have now increased to more than 3 lakh 65 thousand. This has provided employment to more than 12 lakh villagers. Through these centres, the Government is delivering more than 45 services in rural areas.

Honourable Members,

69.   In order to strengthen the spirit of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, My Government is developing integrated and organized systems for the countrymen, through use of technology.

70.   Recently, One Nation, One FasTag has been launched to ensure seamless mobility in the country. One Nation One Mobility Card has enabled use of the same card for different modes of transport across different States. One Nation, One Ration Card is also being launched by the Government. One Nation, One Tax, that is GST, has also promoted transparency in trade and commerce through use of technology. In the pre GST period, more than two dozen different taxes had to be paid. Now, not only the complex tax web has come to an end, the incidence of tax has also been reduced.

Honourable Members,

71.   In a federal country like India it is imperative for fast paced development, that States compete with each other in development schemes; and also share experiences with each other. My Government has therefore been consistently emphasizing Competitive Cooperative Federalism. The Government is ranking States on the basis of real time data collected at district and village level. Its impact is visible in various areas ranging from Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to Ease of Doing Business and Smart City Mission to Aspirational District Programme.

72.   Information collected during the Census plays a crucial role in enabling Governments in formulation of appropriate schemes and targeted interventions. This time digital technology is being used, in the conduct of Census, to collect information so as to complete the process expeditiously.

73.   My Government is committed to protecting privacy amidst the increasing use of digital technology. To fulfil this commitment, Government has introduced the Data Protection Bill in the Parliament.

Honourable Members,

74.   My Government is committed to attaining the goal of making India a USD 5 trillion economy. Towards this objective, Government is making efforts at all levels of the economy, in consultation with all stakeholders. In spite of global challenges, the fundamentals of Indian economy are strong. Our foreign exchange reserves have reached a historical high of over USD 450 billion. Inflow of Foreign Direct Investment to India is also on the rise.  As compared to last year, FDI has increased by USD 3 billion between April and October this year.

75.   On the other hand, merger of small Public Sector Banks has strengthened them and improved their lending capacity. In the first half of this financial year, 12 Public Sector Banks have reported profits. Due to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, nearly Rs 3.5 lakh crores have also been recovered by the banks and other institutions. Reduction of corporate tax and the codification of Labour Laws will increase ease of doing business in India.

Honourable Members,

76.   My Government is providing impetus to Make in India to accelerate the growth rate of the economy and to boost manufacturing and exports. Government is developing two defence corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, in addition to 5 Industrial Corridors in the country.

Honourable Members,

77.   India is making rapid strides in electronics manufacturing sector in particular. National Policy on Electronics has been formulated to give further impetus to the manufacturing of mobile phones, TVs and other electronic devices. The value of electronic equipment manufactured in the country has increased to Rs 4 lakh 58 thousand crore in 2018-19, as against Rs 1 lakh 90 thousand crore in 2014-15. In 2014, there were only 2 companies manufacturing mobiles in India. Today India is the second largest mobile manufacturing hub in the world. Make in India is also being encouraged by the Government in automobile sector and railways. Full indigenous manufacturing of modern trains like Vande Bharat and Tejas Express is in progress.

Honourable Members,

78.   The fundamental mantra of independence was a Self-reliant India. A self-reliant India is possible only when every Indian takes pride in every product made in India. My Government believes in the mantra of ‘Buy local for a better tomorrow’. I urge every representative of the people, from Panchayat level to the Parliament, and every Government in the country, to transform the philosophy of ‘Buy local for a better tomorrow’ into a movement. I also urge every Indian to give priority to local products. By using locally manufactured products, you will be able to help the small entrepreneurs in your area to a great extent. 

Honourable Members,

79.   The poor and the middle classes hope and aspire for a modern 21st century infrastructure in the country. To fulfil this aspiration of the people more than Rs 100 lakh crore will be invested in the next five years. With a special emphasis on connectivity, the Government is also focusing on creation of new highways, new waterways, new airways, and new I-ways.

80.   Rural roads contribute significantly to the country’s infrastructure. Rural roads have now been expanded to every corner of the country through the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana. Third phase of the programme has been launched to strengthen rural roads and connect them to schools, hospitals and agricultural markets. 1 lakh 25 thousand kilometers of roads will be constructed and upgraded under this programme.

81.   Inland waterways are also being developed by the Government. In December 2019, for the first time, container cargo reached Pandu in Assam via National Water Way-2. Under the Jal Marg Vikas Project, the multi-modal terminal at Haldia on River Ganga and the navigation lock at Farakka will be completed this year. It is also our endeavour to operate large transport cargo vessels on River Ganga by next year.

82.   Rapid progress is being made towards providing better public transport facilities in urban areas. Metro facility has now been extended to 18 cities in the country. So far, 670 km of metro lines have been operationalized, and work on another 930 km is underway. The residents of Delhi and NCR have greatly benefitted from the construction of Delhi-Meerut Expressway, as well as from Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways.

Honourable Members,

83.   Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities of the country are emerging in a new role towards achieving the goal of USD 5 trillion economy. The progress of small cities in areas relating to sanitation, amenities, start-ups or other commercial activities has been encouraging. Since 2014, start-ups in small cities have grown at a rate of 45 to 50 per cent. Similarly, about 35 lakh people have so far travelled by air under the UDAN scheme. Last year, 335 new air routes have been approved. It is estimated that in the coming years, more than half of the country’s digital transactions will take place in these tier-2 and tier-3 cities.

84.   My Government is doing its utmost to fulfil the developmental aspirations of small cities and the new middle class. The middle class in small towns has also benefitted the most from tax exemption on income up to Rs. 5 lakhs. The middle class families with annual income of up to Rs 18 lakhs are able to save between Rs 5 to 6 lakh on home loans with tenure up to 20 years. It is the middle class that will benefit the most from the Rs 25 thousand crore fund provided by the Government for completion of stalled housing projects.

Honourable Members,

85.   India is playing an effective role globally in the field of clean energy. Due to the efforts of the Government, LPG coverage in the country has increased from 55 per cent to about 97 per cent. City gas distribution is now being extended to 407 districts of the country. Now we are moving towards a gas-based economy.

86.   Keeping environment conservation in mind, my Government has enhanced the target for producing renewable energy to 450 gigawatts. Under the Pradhan Mantri-Kusum Yojana, it has been targeted to provide more than 17 lakh solar pumps to farmers across the country. Similarly, under the second phase of the solar roof top programme, the target is to generate 38 gigawatt of electricity.

Honourable Members,

87.   The efforts of the countrymen have made it possible to expand India’s tree and forest cover by 13 thousand square kilometers during the last four years. Similarly, the number of tigers has increased to 2,967 in July 2019 from 2,226 in 2014, which is a matter of satisfaction.

88.   To address the issue of air and water pollution, the Government will be implementing the National Clean Air Programme in 102 cities of the country. I am glad that the positive impact of the Namami Gange Mission launched by the Government has now started becoming visible. Under this mission, projects worth Rs 7 thousand crore have been completed and projects worth more than Rs 21 thousand crore are in progress.

89.   The impact of all these efforts is also visible on the country’s tourism sector. During the last few years, there has been extraordinary development of infrastructure related to tourism. Recently a nationwide programme has been launched from Kolkata for conservation and beautification of the heritage buildings of the country. The tourism sector is also being strengthened by the modern infrastructure being developed under Swadesh Darshan and PRASAD schemes. New records are being created every day in the number of tourists visiting the ‘Statue of Unity’, the statue of Sardar Patel; which is the tallest in the world.

Honourable Members,

90.   It is the belief of my Government that paying tribute to the great personalities who dedicated their lives to the nation and contributed towards preserving the heritage of the country is an important part of nation building. With this idea, museums celebrating the contributions made by the brave tribals, both men and women, during our freedom struggle are being set up in different States. The 250th birth anniversary of the great social reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy, whose teachings guided the nation, will also be celebrated in 2022 by the Government in a befitting manner.

Honourable Members,

91.   The objective of India’s space programme has always been service to humanity. Due to the tireless work of country’s space scientists, Chandrayaan-2 has stimulated a new interest in technology among the country’s youth. My Government has already approved Chandrayaan-3. ISRO is also working expeditiously on the manned spacecraft programme – Gaganyaan, as well as Aditya-1 Mission.

Honourable Members,

92.   In these evolving times, to meet the new and complex challenges related to the defence of the country, my Government is working to make the defence forces stronger, more effective and modern. The appointment of CDS, the Chief of Defence Staff and creation of the Department of Military Affairs are steps in this direction. This will also improve coordination among the three services, while speeding up their modernization and the process of making them self-reliant.

93.   We are fully attentive to the requirements of our security forces, including adequate armaments, safety equipment and bullet proof jackets. Manufacture of state-of-the-art AK 203 rifles, in collaboration with Russia, will commence in the Ordnance Factory at Amethi in Uttar Pradesh. Recently, when the Naval Prototype of Tejas landed and took off from INS Vikramaditya, every Indian was filled with pride. The Government has also taken historic steps in enhancing space security. With the successful testing of A-Sat, India has become the fourth country in the world to attain strike capability in space.

Honourable Members,

94.              My Government is working with full strength and determination to free the country from the scourge of terrorism. In view of the changing nature of terrorism, alertness on the part of the citizens is extremely helpful. The decrease in   terrorist activities in Jammu Kashmir demonstrates that public cooperation can be effective in the fight against terrorism. My Government has given the security forces a free hand in taking the strongest measures against those indulging in terrorism. The security situation in the North East has also improved significantly due to the concerted efforts of the Government. The geographical spread of Naxalism is also steadily shrinking. 

Honourable Members,

95.   My Government is of the view that foreign policy is a vital ingredient of the country’s economic and strategic security. We are stimulating economic growth and prosperity by increasing connectivity with our neighbouring countries. “Neighbourhood First” policy is our priority. Apart from our neighbours, we have also strengthened relations with other countries of the world. This is why a number of countries have bestowed their highest honour on India. Our cooperation with ASEAN and African countries is being taken to a new level.

96.   After International Solar Alliance, India has been at the forefront of a global partnership, Coalition on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure-CDRI. This step aimed at mitigating natural disasters will further strengthen India’s stature as a sensitive world power. 

Honourable Members,

97.   This decade, which has just begun, will determine India’s global standing in the times to come. The world will witness an inclusive, prosperous, capable and powerful New India in this decade. Hence it is the bounden duty of every Member of this House and every countryman to strive hard with all their capability to achieve their respective goals.

98.   We should all strive to make every citizen conscious of and dedicated to his duties in the national interest, and ensure that this sense of responsibility becomes the guiding principle of our civic life. Come, let us together make this decade of 2020 the decade of fulfilling our duties. 

99.   We must always remember that we are first and foremost citizens of this country, and leaders or supporters of a particular ideology thereafter. The prestige of our country should be more important than our party loyalties. 

100. It is my belief that in the times to come, all of us together, drawing inspiration from the glorious past of our country, will make every possible effort to ensure a bright future for the country; and that we will also succeed in our endeavour.

101. Let us all come together to fulfil the dream of a New India; let us together make a New India.

Jai Hind !!!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received Mr Jair Bolsonaro, the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (January 25, 2020). He also hosted a banquet in his honour. 

Welcoming the Brazilian President on his first state visit to India, the President said that it is a singular honour to have him as the Chief Guest for our Republic Day celebrations. It is indeed a special occasion for India-Brazil relations. 

The President said that India and Brazil are close friends and Strategic Partners. India attaches the highest importance to its ties with Brazil, both in the bilateral and multilateral arenas. 

The President said that India-Brazil economic relations are progressing well. But we can do a lot more together.  There is huge untapped potential both on the trade and investment sides. Indian companies are active in Brazil in IT, automobiles and energy sectors.  We are keen to leverage defence and food processing expertise of Brazil to boost our Make in India initiatives. We invite Brazilian companies to partner us in our economic programmes. Sectors such as renewable energy, biotechnology and animal husbandry also present huge opportunities for our companies.  

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that on the strong historical foundation, India and Brazil have established a multi-faceted partnership, one that would inspire many.

                Dear fellow citizens,


	On the eve of our 71st Republic Day, I extend my warm greetings to all of you, in India and abroad. 



	Seven decades ago, on 26th January, our Constitution came into effect. Even before that, this date had acquired special significance. Having resolved to attain ‘Purna Swaraj’, our people had been celebrating ‘Purna Swaraj Day’ on every 26th January from 1930 to 1947. That is why, in 1950 we embarked our journey as a Republic on the 26th January, affirming to the principles laid down in our Constitution. Since then, every year we celebrate our Republic Day on 26th January. 



	The modern State comprises the three organs – Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, which are necessarily interlinked and interdependent. Yet, on ground, the people comprise the State. ‘We the People’ are the prime movers of the Republic. With us, the people of India rests the real power to decide our collective future. 



	Our Constitution gave us rights as citizens of a free democratic nation, but also placed on us the responsibility to always adhere to the central tenets of our democracy – justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. It becomes easier for us to follow these constitutional ideals, if we keep in mind the life and values of the Father of our Nation. By doing so, we will be adding a meaningful dimension to our celebrations of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji. 


Dear fellow citizens,


	The Government has launched a number of welfare campaigns, and what is especially noteworthy about them is the fact that citizens have voluntarily turned them into popular movements. The ‘Swachchh Bharat Abhiyan’ has achieved astounding success in such a short time. The same spirit can be seen in other endeavours. Be it giving up cooking fuel subsidy or pushing digital payments, the common man has made the government programmes his own, making them truly effective. The success of the ‘Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana’ is a matter of pride, as the target of 8 crore beneficiaries has been achieved. With this, those in need have access to clean fuel. The ‘Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana’, that is, ‘Saubhagya’ too has brightened people’s lives. Under ‘Pradhanmantri Kisan Samman Nidhi’, more than 14 crore farmer families have become entitled to receive minimum annual income of Rupees six thousand. This has enabled the farmers who feed us to live a life of dignity.  


To effectively meet the challenge of the increasing water crisis, the Ministry of Jalshakti has been created. Water conservation and water management are being given top priority. I am confident that, like ‘Swachchh Bharat Abhiyan’, ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’ too will take the form of a popular movement. 


	Along with the welfare of those most in need, every policy initiative of the Government is guided by the ‘nation-first’ principle. The roll-out of the GST has realised our vision of ‘One country, One tax, One market’. It is being complemented by the e-NAM scheme, which is strengthening the process of creating ‘one market for one nation’ and will benefit farmers. There is a consistent effort by the government to ensure overall development of each and every part of the country – be it Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh, the states in the North-East or our Islands in the Indian Ocean. 



	Strong internal security is essential for the development of the country. Therefore, the government has taken several concrete steps to strengthen the internal security system.
	Access to health and education are often considered the foundation of good governance. In both these sectors, we have come a long way in the seven decades. The Government has rightly focused its attention on the health sector, with its ambitious initiatives. Starting with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, and expanding to the Ayushman Bharat, which is the world’s largest publicly funded universal healthcare programme, the Government has shown its care and concern for the well-being of the poor. Quality of healthcare has improved, so has its reach. The Jan Aushadhi Yojana has brought down the healthcare budget of common people in the country by providing quality generic medicines at affordable prices. 


Dear fellow citizens,


	The foundations of a sound education system were built in ancient times, with the setting up of great universities like Nalanda and Takshashila. In India, knowledge has always been considered more valuable than power, fame or riches. In our tradition, educational institutions are respected as temples of learning. When our land was pushed into backwardness after the long colonial rule, it was education that emerged as a path to empowerment. Even though the development of our educational institutions commenced soon after Independence, in an environment of scarcity of resources, our achievements in the field of education have followed a remarkable trajectory. Our endeavour is to ensure that no child or youth is denied education. At the same time, we need to strive to reach global education standards by continuous reform of our educational systems.
	India is proud of the achievements of ISRO. They are making further progress in Mission Gaganyaan, and the nation excitedly looks forward to the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme gaining further momentum this year.
	This is also the year of Tokyo Olympics. While India has traditionally done well in a number of sports, the new generation of players and athletes has brought laurels for the nation in more and more varieties of sports in recent years. At Olympics 2020, the Indian contingent will be backed by cheers and good wishes of millions of Indians. 
	Another source of pride for our country has been our diaspora. During my visits abroad, I have observed that Indians have not only brought prosperity to their adopted lands, they have also enhanced India’s image before the world community. Many of them have made great contributions in a wide variety of endeavours. 


Dear fellow citizens, 


	I have nothing but unreserved praise for our armed forces, paramilitary and internal security forces. Their sacrifices to preserve the integrity and unity of our country present a saga of unparalleled courage and discipline. Our farmers, doctors and nurses, teachers who impart learning and values, scientists and engineers, alert and active youth, industrious members of our workforce, entrepreneurs contributing to our economic wealth, artists who enrich our culture, service sector professionals who have earned global appreciation, our fellow countrymen contributing in many other spheres of activity and specially our resilient daughters who have scaled new heights of  achievements against odds - they all bring pride to our nation. 



	Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to interact with some achievers who have done commendable work in various fields. Working silently, they have made immense contributions to various fields including science and innovation, sports, empowerment of Divyang persons, farming and afforestation, women and child empowerment, education, healthcare, revival of old art forms and providing food and nutrition to the needy. For example, Sushri Aarifa Jan has revived the Numdha handicrafts in Jammu & Kashmir; Sushri Ratnawali Kottapalli has been serving patients suffering from thalassemia in Telangana; Shrimati Devaki Amma has developed forest wealth through her individual efforts in Kerala; Shri Jamkhojang Misao has improved the lives of many people through his community development efforts in Manipur and Shri Babar Ali has been providing education to underprivileged children in West Bengal since his childhood. There are numerous such examples, I have mentioned only a few of them. They exemplify that ordinary people can make extraordinary contributions. There are a large number of voluntary organisations too who have been contributing to the project of nation-building, and complementing the initiatives of government.  


Fellow Citizens,


	We are now in the third decade of the twenty-first century. This will be the decade of the rise of New India and a new generation of Indians. More and more of those born in this century are participating in the national discourse. With the passage of time, we are gradually losing living links with our great freedom struggle, but there is no reason to worry about the continuity of the beliefs that guided it. With advances in technology, the young minds of today are better informed and more confident. The next generation remains strongly committed to the core values of our nation. For our youth, the nation always comes first. With them, we are witnessing the emergence of a New India.
	Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals remain relevant in our nation-building efforts. It should be part of our daily routine to introspect on Gandhiji’s message of truth and nonviolence, which has become all the more necessary in our times. 


When fighting for a cause, people, particularly the youth, should not forget the gift of Ahimsa Gandhiji gave to humanity. Gandhiji’s talisman for deciding whether an act is right or wrong also applies to the functioning of our democracy. Government and opposition both have important roles to play. While giving expression to their political ideas, both must move forward in tandem to ensure that development of the country and welfare of its people are promoted consistently.  

Dear fellow citizens,


	As our Republic Day is a celebration of our Constitution, let me conclude with the words of its chief architect, Babasaheb Ambedkar: 


“If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? The first thing in my judgment we must do is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives.” 

These words have always lighted our path. These words will continue to show us the way ahead to new glories. 

Dear citizens,


	The idea of world as a large well-knit family, captured in our message of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, strengthens our relations with other nations. We have been sharing our democratic ideals and the fruits of our development with the entire world. 


We have a tradition of inviting foreign heads of states to participate in our Republic Day celebrations. I am glad that this year, our distinguished friend, The President of Brazil, Mr. Jair Bolsonaro will take part in our Republic Day function tomorrow. 

As India and Indians march forward, we remain committed to engaging the global community to build a secure and prosperous future for ourselves and for the entire humanity.


	I once again convey my Republic Day greetings to all of you and I extend my best wishes for your bright future.


Jai Hind!

                General Duty Medical Officers (GDMOs) of the Central Health Services attending the 4th Foundation Training Programme at the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (January 23, 2020) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Addressing the young doctors, the President said that our country has made great strides in providing healthcare to our people. Diseases such as polio and smallpox, which once claimed so many lives, have been defeated. Our immunisation programme is gaining strength. We have brought down the Maternal Mortality Rate and Infant Mortality Rate. Yet, we still face many challenges and have a long way to go in evolving a holistic healthcare system, one which is uniformly affordable and accessible to our citizens both in rural and urban areas. In this regard, it is a matter of satisfaction that the government has made Universal health coverage a priority. The rollout and success of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a critical step in this direction. We have to keep building on this great momentum and doctors will play an important role in doing so. 

The President said that the disease burden in our country is undergoing an evolution. We have to tackle widespread diseases such as TB, malaria and dengue, and at the same time deal with the rising incidence of lifestyle diseases like diabetes, obesity, hypertension, depression etc.  He urged doctors to work towards a multidisciplinary approach to health – from prevention, wellness, cure, community empowerment to research and innovation. 

The President said that as doctors, they can play a major role in encouraging healthy lifestyles. We can address the increasing stress in our lives with regular exercises and physical activity, practicing Yoga and Meditation. Doctors can be a major influencer in promoting such lifestyles and bringing about a culture of wellness.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the 14th Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards at a ceremony held in New Delhi today (January 20, 2020). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards honour those journalists from print, broadcast and digital media who have maintained the highest standards of their profession and, despite immense challenges, produced work that sustains public trust in the media and impacts the lives of people. The awards are meant to felicitate those who hold their pen for truth. He congratulated all the award winners and urged them to never let go of their pursuit for truth which is the only compass for good journalism.

The President recalled magical touchstone of five Ws and H (what, when, why, where, who and how) whose answers were essential for a story to qualify as a news report. He said that in the din of the “breaking news” syndrome that has consumed the media now, this fundamental principle of restraint and responsibility has been undermined substantially. Fake news has emerged a new menace, whose purveyors proclaim themselves as journalists and taint this noble profession.

The President said that journalists tend to wear many hats in the line of their duty. These days, they often assume the role of an investigator, a prosecutor and a judge – all rolled into one. It requires a great deal of inner strength and incredible passion for journalists to play so many roles at a time to arrive at truth. Their versatility is praiseworthy. But that prompts him to ask if such a sweeping exercise of power is accompanied by genuine accountability.

The President urged all to ponder for a moment as to what Shri Ramnath Goenka would have done, had he encountered a crisis of credibility on account of paid news or fake news. He would never have allowed the situation to go adrift and initiated measures for course correction for the whole media fraternity. There is no doubt that journalism has been passing through a critical phase.

The President said that the quest for truth is difficult and easier said than done. But it must be pursued. A democracy like ours deeply relies on the uncovering of facts and a willingness to debate them. Democracy is meaningful only when the citizen is well informed. In that sense, excellence in journalism grants full meaning to democracy.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the tenth foundation day of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) and the seventh convocation ceremony in New Delhi today (January 15, 2020). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that In India, we need about two lakh liver transplants a year, while only a few thousand are done every year. There is need to establish liver transplant programs in more public hospitals and ILBS can provide necessary expertise in this regard. But perhaps most crucial is to encourage organ donation and spread awareness about it. There is a huge gap between the requirement and availability of organs needed for saving lives. The dearth of donors results mainly from lack of awareness about organ donation. He urged ILBS to prepare a roadmap suggesting ways and means to encourage Liver donation, to improve the related procedures and protocols, and to strengthen the infrastructure needed to support a higher number of Liver transplants than is currently possible.

The President said that the growing incidence of liver diseases is also linked to our unhealthy lifestyles. He noted that, at present, nearly one out of four Indians have fatty liver and may be ten per cent of them have liver diseases due to excessive body fat. He said that this condition is known to be a precursor to development of diabetes and heart disease. And diabetics have greater incidence of liver disease than others. It is for institutes like ILBS to take up research that can clarify the linkages between our lifestyle and liver diseases. That would help in developing a preventive care system based in lifestyle changes.

India is a land of festivals. The coming festivals, celebrated under different names and forms across the country, are also an occasion to mark our respect for the ceaseless hard work of our farmers. These festivals, symbolising the joy of sharing the new crop with one’s family and community, are intertwined in the soul of the country. All communities celebrate these festivals with the spirit of mutual love, affection and fraternity.

Such festivals have an invaluable contribution in the geographical, cultural and emotional unification of the country. I am confident that these festivals will help further strengthen the spirit of peaceful co-existence and unity, and further enhance the prosperity and happiness of the nation.”

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind arrived in Lakshadweep this morning for his first ever State Visit to the Union Territory. 

President was received at Kavaratti by Administrator of Lakshadweep Shri Dineshwar Sharma along with others. He was accorded a Guard of Honour and received a traditional welcome at Karavatti.

The President later attended a public reception where he laid the foundation stone of a super specialty hospital.

While addressing the audience the President said that this a special place, blessed with unparalleled natural beauty. However, the clear blue waters of Lakshadweep reflect not just the magic of nature. It also testifies to the wisdom of all of the people of these islands, and their love and concern for environment. Lakshadweep presents itself as a mesmerizing eco-system made up of its under-water life, pristine lagoons, coral reefs, warm waters and its people.

He said that I am aware that living here comes with some unique challenges, such as maintaining connectivity with the mainland and among islands, and harsh weather conditions particularly during monsoons. Nothing though has prevented Lakshadweep’s onward march and progress.

The President said that he was happy to lay the foundation stone of the super-specialty Hospital here at Kavaratti. He said that the hospital will address many of the health related issues of people living here in Kavaratti as well as those living in other islands. More importantly, when this hospital comes up and becomes fully functional, it would significantly reduce the need for patients to go to Kochi for treatment.

The President said that there are issues that confront people of Lakshadweep. For instance, all islands in Lakshadweep are totally dependent for electricity on diesel generators. He said that we need to explore ways to reduce the dependence on diesel generated power. We should look to expand the use of renewable energy in Lakshadweep, given that both wind and sun are available here in abundance. I also understand that Lakshadweep has scarcity of potable water. This is another area where innovative solutions need to be found and adopted. I am sure that people of Lakshadweep and the authorities concerned will work together to address all such issues.

                Chairman of Rajya Sabha Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has suggested to all the concerned to ensure submission of reports on Demands for Grants of various Ministries by the Department Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) well before the Budget is approved by the Parliament. Elaborating on this, he said submission of such reports later would not give time for the Government to consider the recommendations made by DRSCs in respect of various ministries.  Shri Naidu spoke on the need for timely submission of reports at a meeting of leaders of various parties and groups in Rajya Sabha, at his residence, today on the occasion of the Budget Session that commenced today.

            The Chairman urged the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs to talk to all concerned including Chairmen of various Committees regarding timely submission of reports on Demands for Grants and further said that he would also speak to the Lok Sabha Speaker, Shri Om Birla in this regard. The leaders who attended the meeting have welcomed the suggestion of Shri Naidu.

            Shri Naidu reminded the leaders of the good work done by the Rajya Sabha during the last two Sessions in terms of the productivity and quality of debates and urged them to ensure the same positive momentum during the Budget Session. He said that Budget Session offers ample opportunities to raise and discuss all issues of wider public concern during the long debates on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his Address at the Joint Session and the Budget discussion. He also advised leaders to ensure that Members belonging to respective parties come prepared to make effective contribution to the debates in the House.

            Voicing his concern over inadequate attendance during the proceedings of the House and in the meetings of various committees, Shri Naidu urged the leaders of various parties to ensure attendance by their Members. He noted that a situation of lack of quorum should not arise as it reflects poorly on the functioning of legislatures.

While assuring cooperation of the Opposition in transacting legislative business, Shri Azad said that Government should be willing to accommodate their concerns and enable various issues of public concern to be discussed in the House. Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Shri Prahlad Joshi said that Government is always willing to discuss any issue as decided by the Chairman.

            Those who attended the meeting include; Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Shri Harivansh, Leader of the House Shri Thawar Chand Gehlot, Leader of Opposition Shri Ghulam Nabi Azad, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Shri Prahlad Joshi, External Affairs Minister Shri Jai Shankar, I&B Minister Shri  Prakash Javadekar, Minister of Railways Shri Piyush Goyal, Shri Ram Gopal Yadav (SP), Shri Derek O` Brien (TMC), Shri Sanjay Rout (Shiv Sena), Shri Tiruchi Siva (DMK), Shri Prasanna Acharya (BJD), Shri R.C.P. Singh (JDU), Shri Balvinder Bhundar(SAD),  Dr. K. Keshava Rao (TRS), Shri T.K. Radhakrishnan(CPM), Shri Binoy Vishwom (CPI), Shri Vaiko (MDMK)  and Shri V. Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP).

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today appealed to the youth to stay away from those encouraging violence and said that those instigating violence were working against the interests of the nation.

Interacting at Upa-Rashtrapati Bhawan with the members of NSS who have participated in the Republic Day Parade Camp in New Delhi, he said that some forces were trying to create tension and violence. Cautioning the youth to be careful against such forces, he said “If you destroy a public property, you are destroying your own future.” 

Observing that violence has no place in Democracy, he said that dissent was acceptable but not disintegration. He underlined that in a democracy, it was important to discuss and debate but not disrupt. “Ballot is more powerful than bullet,” he added.

Asking the youth to develop a positive outlook and engage in constructive nation building activities, he said that the youth should be in the forefront of the fight against social evils like corruption, gender and caste discrimination. 

“Youngsters like you must strive to build a New India which will be free of poverty, discrimination, inequalities, and hunger,” he said.  

Expressing concern over the rising incidence of Non Communicable Diseases due to sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diet, among others, Shri Naidu asked youngsters to participate regularly in physical activities, and avoid junk food. 

The Vice President said that the traditional Indian food was time-tested, healthy and suitable to each region and season. 

He said that the Fitness India call given by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi was to ensure that the youth of the country were healthy and fit. “Similarly, the practice of Yoga would ensure unity of mind and body,” he added.

Referring to Prime Minister’s call to visit 15 important tourist destinations before 2022, the Vice President asked all educational institutions to organise Bharat Darshan for students on a regular basis. He said that such visits would enhance the understanding of India’s unique cultural mosaic.

Shri Naidu also advised educational institutions to encourage students take up voluntary services like NSS, NCC, Scouts and Guides and others mandatorily from schooldays.

He said that such training would help students to develop the feeling of oneness, empathy and compassion and become sensitive to the needs of the less fortunate.

He suggested that National Service Scheme should be re-christened as “National Selfless Service.” 

The Minister of State (I/C) for the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Shri Kiren Rijiju, Secretary to Vice President of India, Shri I.V. Subbarao and more than 200 NSS volunteers were present.

Following is the full text of the speech – 

“My dear young friends,

I am delighted to be interacting with volunteers of the National Service Scheme (NSS) who have participated in the Republic Day Parade this year. I welcome you all to the official residence of the Vice President of India.

I am happy that all the youth volunteers who opt to serve the nation through the NSS-led community service wear the NSS badge with pride and a sense of responsibility towards helping the needy.

By participating in voluntary service activities such as NSS you are trying to realize the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi, who had said: “the best way to find one-self is to lose one-self in the service of others”.

I am aware that all of you are here to participate in the NSS Republic Day Parade Camp. I hope that the camp helped you to interact with fellow members hailing from various parts of India and gave you an opportunity to experience the rich diversity of India in terms cultures and language, apart from promoting a bond of camaraderie and brotherhood among all of you.

The motto of NSS – ‘NOT ME BUT YOU’, reflects India’s core philosophy of ‘Share and Care’. 

A stint in NSS will not only provide you with an opportunity to serve the nation, especially during the difficult times of natural calamities such as floods, earthquakes, but will also inculcate, team-spirit and enhance leadership qualities.

 

The National Integration Camp (NIC) organized by NSS, will help the volunteers visiting different parts of the country to gain a deeper understanding of our glorious history, heritage, traditions, customs and festivals, apart from promoting national integration. It infuses a sense of love towards various regions of the country.

Participating in the adventure activities like mountain-trekking, rafting, Para-sailing and basic skiing will not only take you  closer to nature but will also improve your physical and mental strength.

I appreciate your passion and commitment to take up community service at a young age. 

My dear young friends,

Travelling is an essential part of life and it teaches many things that cannot be taught in the classroom. While those participating in NSS would get an opportunity travel to different corners of the country, I would like all colleges and schools to organise trips to well-known archaeological sites, monuments, forts, and other places of history that stand as testimony to India’s vibrant heritage.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi had recently given a call to the youth to visit at least 15 tourist destinations within India by 2022 to give a boost to domestic tourism. Such visits will enhance the understanding of India’s unique cultural mosaic.

A ‘Bharat Dashan’ tour for students must be conducted on a regular basis by educational institutions.

My dear Friends,

While India has made advances in many fields, including education, science & technology, agriculture, space, IT and medicine, we still have daunting challenges on different fronts—we should strive to become a 100 per cent literate country, we need to eradicate poverty and bridge the urban rural-divide. 

Youngsters like you should be in the forefront of wiping out social evils like caste and gender discrimination. You must also take the lead in protecting the environment and nature. My mantra to today’s youth is: preserve culture and protect nature for a better future.

Youth must develop the spirit of voluntarism and service right from school days.

Ours is a young nation with more than 65% of the population under the age of 35. The huge demographic advantage has to be completely leveraged to fast-track progress of the nation. As part of empowering the young men and women, the government has launched many initiatives like Skill India, Digital India, Start Up India and Stand Up India.

For India to achieve its dream of inclusive and sustainable development and occupy its rightful place in the comity of nations, it is imperative that its youth population, brimming with potential, must be healthy..

Lack of exercise, unhealthy diet, tobacco use and alcohol abuse are among the factors that are contributing to rising NCDs. 

Dear youngsters, always remain physically fit and take active part in sports, games or yoga. 

As we all are aware, yoga is an excellent means to achieve physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of an individual. It is an excellent stress management technique and is an effective remedy for several diseases, especially lifestyle-related ones.

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given a three-word mantra –‘Reform, Perform and Transform’. We need to transform India in all spheres and achieve the goal of a $ 5 trillion economy in the coming years.

The youth must develop a positive outlook and take part passionately in constructive activities. Peace is the foremost perquisite for progress. I appeal to the youth to stay away from those encouraging violence. Those instigating violence are working against the interests of the nation. Please remember that there is no place for violence in a democracy. 

Youngsters like you must strive to build a New India which will be free of poverty, discrimination, inequalities, corruption, and hunger. 

Finally, I would like to say that a stint in voluntary services like NSS, NCC, Scouts and Guides and others should be made mandatory for children from schooldays.

I believe such training will help students to develop the feeling of oneness, empathy and compassion and become sensitive to the needs of the less fortunate.

My best wishes to all of you for future endeavours!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called upon the youth to develop a positive outlook and strive to build a New India which will be free of poverty, discrimination, inequalities, corruption and hunger. 

Speaking at Kalam’s Convention -2020 organised by the Kalam’s Institute of Youth Excellence at the Brahma Kumaris’ Shanti Sarovar Lane in Hyderabad, he urged the youth to not support those who are encouraging violence. 

Shri Naidu observed that those who were instigating violence were anti-people and working against the interests of the nation. 

Stating that peace was the foremost prerequisite for development of the country, he said there was no scope for violence in democracy and asserted that ballot was more powerful than bullet. 

Observing that youth were the future of the country, the Vice President urged them to always protect India’s rich cultural heritage, traditions and age-old civilizational values.   He wanted the youth to show empathy and concern for the less privileged by adopting India’s core philosophy of share and care. 

Stressing the need to reorient the education system to nurture children to be creative, imaginative and innovative, the Vice President called for revisiting the history textbooks to highlight the immense sacrifices and contributions made by freedom fighters from different parts of the country like Alluri Seetarama Raju, Veerapandia Kattabomman, Lala Lajapati Rai and Veer Savarkar among others. 

Talking about the need to have ethics in public life, the Vice President urged people to elect representatives who possess character, good conduct, capacity and calibre and not the other 4 Cs-- Caste, Community, Cash and Criminality.

Paying rich tributes to Former President of India, Shri APJ Abdul Kalam, theVice President said that Dr. Kalam was the shining example that human beings could shape their lives through will, persistence, hard work, discipline, dedication and sheer courage and perseverance. 

“He dreamt of building a developed India and took up a mission to ignite the young minds for national development by meeting the students across the country,” he added.

Describing Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam as an extraordinary scientist, visionary leader, passionate teacher and a compassionate human being, Shri Naidu said that he inspired Indian youth to aim high, dream big and work hard to achieve their goals.  

Shri Naidu asked the youth to be in the forefront in the fight against social evils, like caste and gender discrimination and also take lead in protecting the environment and nature, while learning to live with it. 

The Chairman of DRDO, Dr. G. Satish Reddy, Indian Founder, Kalam’s Institute of Youth Excellence, Shri Naresh, Trustee, Kalam’s Institute of Youth Excellence, Shri Pidikiti Bhopal and the Chairman, Gandhi Global Family, Dr.Gunna Rajendar Reddy, were present at the event.

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am pleased to amidst all of you at Kalam’s Convention -2020 organised by Kalam’s Institute of Youth Excellence.

Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam was an extraordinary scientist, visionary leader, passionate teacher and a compassionate human being, who inspired Indian youth to aim high and dream big. 

Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalam went on to become country’s one of the most celebrated scientists.  He made significant contribution as Project Director to develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space Club.

He was responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle programme, particularly the PSLV configuration. 

After working for two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle technologies, Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided Missiles at DRDO. 

He was responsible for the development of AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles. He also played important role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in collaboration with Department of Atomic Energy, which made India a nuclear weapon State. 

Shri APJ Abdul Kalam was a versatile personality. He excelled in whatever he did. His contribution to nation building is immense. In recognition of his service to motherland, he was awarded the coveted civilian awards - Padma Bhushan (1981) and Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the highest civilian award Bharat Ratna (1997). 

As a young boy from humble background, Shri Kalam sold newspapers to support his family’s income. And he rose to the highest office in India.

He is the shining example that human beings can shape their lives through will, persistence, ability and sheer courage. His character, commitment and inspirational vision inspire the youth of the country.

He dreamt of building a developed India and took up a mission to ignite the young minds for national development by meeting the students across the country.

He firmly believed in the potential of Indian youth and wanted them to be leaders in country’s transformation. He had said - 

""Children have hard-wired ability to be creative, imaginative and innovative that often diminishes along the way. These inherent capabilities have to be identified and encouraged to have a new breed of innovative thinkers who are prepared to solve future challenges of our world.""

In line with this, the Government led by the Prime Minster, Shri Narendra Modi has launched Atal Innovation Mission to create an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship among the students. More than 5400 Atal Tinkering Labs have been established in schools across the country benefitting over 60 lakh students. 

Dr Kalam was not just a role model for the children, he had an inherent passion for teaching and a zeal to inspire children to become good citizens. 

He had great regard for the teachers and advocated education with values. About the aims of a teacher, he said, 

""The aim of the teacher should be to build character, human values enhance the learning capacity of children through technology and build the confidence among children to be innovative and creative which in turn will make them competitive to face the future.""

Swami Vivekananda also defined the education as a process by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, and intellect is sharpened, as a result of which one can stand on one’s own feet. And teacher’s role becomes paramount in this process.

Traditionally teacher has got a reverential place in Indian society. Our Shastras say – 

गुरुर्ब्रह्मा गुरुर्विष्णुः गुरुर्देवो महेश्‍वरः । गुरु साक्षात्‌ परब्रह्म तस्मै श्रीगुरुवे नमः ॥

Meaning that ‘I bow to the ‘Guru’ who to me is Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, Guru is the supreme God’.

This respect to Guru was what made India ‘Vishwa Guru’ in ancient times. Our ancestors were well aware of the role a teacher plays in the progress of a society.

Echoing this age old Indian wisdom, Dr Kalam said,

""Teachers have to realize that they are the builders of the society. The society can be built only when the students are made proficient in their subjects. In addition they have to provide a vision for life to the students and also inculcate the fundamentals of values which he should practice in the years to come.""

Dr. Kalam always asked teachers to become role models for students. His dedication to teaching was so deep that he was delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong even on his last day. 

In this last speech, Dr Kalam talked of ‘Creating a livable earth’ and said – 

“Sustainable development enables the realisation of green clean environment without pollution, having prosperity without poverty, peace without fear of war and a happy place to live for all citizens of the nation of the world.”

In this last speech, Dr.Kalam laid the blueprint of his ‘World vision 2030 of a livable planet earth’. Many of the ideas in this ‘World Vision 2030’ were already discussed by him in his famous ‘Vision 2020 - Ten Pillars of Development’.

In both these documents, he talks of the need to narrow down the rural and urban divide.

In this regard, it would be appropriate to revisit his famous concept of PURA – Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas. Connectivity is at the core of the PURA concept. 

Dr Kalam visualised providing four elements of connectivity: physical connectivity, electronic connectivity, knowledge connectivity leading to economic connectivity of rural areas and where there would be a lesser urban-rural divide.

A noble initiative for providing Physical connectivity by building rural roads roads was launched under the leadership former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The scheme Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana was launched to connect all villages with roads. I was Rural Development Minister then and was closely associated with this project which was very close to my heart.

During last five years, nearly two lakh kilometers of new roads have been built across rural India under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.

It is praiseworthy that now the government has decided to launch the 3rd Phase of this scheme. It involves upgradation of one lakh twenty five thousand kilometres of rural roads in the coming five years. In this phase focus will be onthose roads that connect habitations with agricultural markets, schools and hospitals.

For electronic connectivity, the Government is implementing Bharat Net project to connect all Gram Panchayats through high-speed broadband.

Over four lakh kilometres Optical Fibre Cable has already been laid in 1.46 lakh Gram Panchayats. 

This project will facilitate the delivery of e-governance, e-health, e-education, e-banking and other services to rural India. We have already seen the impact of JAM (Jan Dhan – Adhar – Mobile)in Direct Benefit Transfer of certain subsidies.

Following the core philosophy of Dr Kalam’s vision of reducing the gap between rural and urban facilities, the Government has launched the Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM). It aims at developing rural areas by provisioning of economic, social and physical infrastructure facilities.

Another idea that finds place in Dr Kalam’s Vision 2020 and Vision 2030 for a livable world is of equitable distribution and adequate access to energy and quality water.

In this regard, it is noteworthy India has achieved landmarks in energy access with every willing rural household provided with an electricity connection under Pradhan Mantri Saubhagya scheme. Only few households are left in four naxal affected districts. Even the International Energy Agency called it as the one of ‘the greatest success stories of the year 2018’.

Similarly, more than 8 crore LPG connections have been released under Ujjawala scheme. This has brought the much needed relief to the rural women who had to spend hours every day in collecting fuel wood.

As far as the quality water supply is concerned, the Government is committed to provide Har Ghar Jal (piped water supply) to all rural households by 2024 under the Jal Jeevan Mission. A new Jal Shakti Mantralaya, has been constituted for integrated and holistic water management.

In his quest for making ‘making planet earth livable’ Dr Kalam called for constantly improving energy efficiency in an integrated way and termed it ‘5th fuel’.

It is heartening that the Government has launched a number of initiatives in the area of energy efficiency. UJALA is a proven example of it. Under this scheme, traditional bulbs were replaced with more power efficient LED bulbs. Under this more than 36 crore LED bulbs have been distributed so far. It is saving 47,000 million units of electricity per year. Similarly more than one crore LED streetlights have been installed in place of traditional ones, saving 7210 million units of electricity per year.

Now the Government is focussing on energy efficiency in the area of air-conditioning. A campaign has been launched to encourage people to run their ACs at 24 degree centigrade. This not only saves energy but is good for health also. I call upon the fellow countrymen to adopt it as a good practice and keep their AC temperatures at 24 degree centigrade.

In his Vision 2020, Dr Kalam dreamt of a nation where the best of healthcare is available to all. Ayushman Bharat Scheme is a step in that direction. This is the “world’s largest government funded healthcare program” targeting more than 50 crore beneficiaries.

Dr Kalam knew that world will not be livable unless every nation is able to give a clean and green environment to all its citizens. 

Towards this end, the Government of India has set an ambitious target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. Prime Minister has taken lead in establishing International Solar Alliance to harness the power of sun.

Dr Kalam’s sensitivity and love towards nature can be best illustrated by an incident from his life. 

Agni was on launch pad and night before the launch was a stressful one. The Defence Minister asked Dr Kalam, “what would you like me to do to celebrate the Agni success tomorrow”? 

Dr Kalam thought for a moment and replied, “We need one lakh saplings to plant at Research Centre Imarat (RCI)”.

The next day Agni took off at 0710 hrs and it was a perfect launch. 

Kalam earned love and respect from everywhere. Not just in India, but also the whole world. 

It was year 2010 United Nations paid him respect by declaring his birthday as 'World Students Day'. Similarly, Switzerland declared May 26 as Science Day in his honour and NASA named a new organism found on International Space Station after the Dr.Kalam.

Speaking about corruption in India, Kalam beautifully stated that the 'reform' has to start from our home itself. Therefore, if a home is corruption free, our village and city will be corruption free, gradually our state will be corruption free and the nation as well.

The ‘Missile Man’ was always a ‘Smiling Man’. He set up the examples of personal integrity in life. He donated his entire presidential salary to a trust named PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas), which was also formed by himself. The list of his good deeds is innumerable and invaluable.

When the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kalam Memorial near Rameshwaram, I had said that APJ Abdul Kalam stands for 'Anything is Possible with Just Attitude and Karma'. He was a true Karma Yogi who continues to inspire the generations.

Let us all believe in and work towards realizing the vision and make India a developed nation.

Thank you.

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today underscored the need for global cooperation for early detection of new viruses and to contain any serious fallout from outbreak of epidemics.

Addressing scientists and researchers of CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad, the Vice President while referring to the newly-discovered strain of Coronavirus, said that it was spreading across the nations and causing a major concern to health authorities.

He pointed out that period outbreak of epidemics and new viruses highlighted our vulnerability to diseases.

Referring to the vital role of the Indian Science and Technology Innovation (STI) System in achieving national goals as India aspires for sustainable and inclusive growth, he appealed to the private sector to create a fund for financing innovative scientific projects that will address societal concerns. 

Observing that investment in STI plays a major role in promoting research and developing cutting edge technologies, Shri Naidu said the funding for basic research also has to be stepped up.

Stressing that the outcome of every scientific endeavour must improve the lives of people, he called upon scientists of CCMB and other scientific labs to find answers to the many challenges the world was facing today like poverty, effects of climate change, pollution, lack of clean drinking water, sanitation, increasing urbanization and growing drug resistance, among others. 

Lauding CCMB for developing bacterial blight-resistant Sambah Mahsuri rice variety in collaboration with Indian Institute of Rice Research (IIRR), Shri Naidu urged scientists to find ways to develop more disease and pest-resistant crops and aid in increasing productivity to make agriculture viable and sustainable. He stressed the need to protect farmers from the vagaries of nature.

Touching upon the problem of growing anti-microbial resistance, Shri Naidu said that modern medicine was facing a serious threat on account of it and expressed the fear that many antibiotics might eventually become ineffective if the trend continued unchecked.

Calling for developing new antibiotics, apart from preventing drug resistance, he expressed his happiness that CCMB was working in that direction.

.The Vice President also urged CCMB to develop Rapid DNA Testing Kits for detection of some of the rare diseases and many other genetic disorders. “It is important to predict and prevent genetic diseases as more than 70 million Indians are estimated to be suffering from genetic disorders, according to the Organization for Rare Diseases India (ORDI)”, Shri Naidu added.

He also advised institutions like CCMB to take up campaigns on a massive scale to create awareness among the people about the health risks associated with consanguineous marriages, particularly those relating to congenital disorders.

While expressing his delight that India was now at 3rd position globally in the number of peer-reviewed Science and Engineering Publications and moved to 52ndposition in the Global Innovation Index, he said there was no room for complacency. “We need to improve further and aim to be among the top nations in scientific discoveries and inventions”, Shri Naidu stressed.

The Vice President said that young scientists should be allowed to take up challenging research assignments and come up with innovative and out-of-box ideas.

Earlier, he went around the exhibits which highlighted the research activities undertaken by CCMB. 

CCMB Director, Dr. Rakesh Mishra, Directors of various CSIR labs, senior scientists and researchers were present on the occasion.

 

The following is the full text of the speech: 

I am extremely delighted to visit CCMB, one of India’s premier scientific institutions and interact with all of you.

I was just now shown around some of the facilities and was briefed on the work being done here. My compliments to the Director and all the senior scientists, researchers and others for the excellent work being done in these labs!

From DNA fingerprinting technology to population genetics, CCMB has made impressive strides in various domains of biology.

I was particularly impressed with some of your research outcomes like the bacterial blight-resistant improved Samba Mahsuri variety developed in collaboration with the Directorate of Rice Research. I am happy to note that the improved variety is being grown ineight states in about 3 lakh hectares with a turnover of about Rs. 2880 crore. I am told that trait specific benefit to the farmers is about Rs. 550 crore. 

I am a farmer myself and I understand the suffering and pain of the farmers when their crops get blighted by disease.

I am also aware that the DNA fingerprinting technology developed at CCMB made India the third country ever to have its indigenous probe for DNA fingerprinting. 

Over the years, thanks to the untiring efforts of our scientists, India has achieved remarkable progress in various areas from achieving self-sufficiency in food production because of green revolution to making spectacular strides in space exploration.

I am quite delighted to know that India now stands at 3rd position globally, in the number of peer-reviewed Science and Engineering Publications. Equally appreciable is that India improved its ranking by five places in the Global Innovation Index and moved to 52nd position in 2019.

 

It also pleasing to note that the total number of patent applications filed by scientists and inventors in India increased to 61,788 in FY19 (up to Dec 18) from 47,857 in FY18. Thus, India stood in 10th position for patents which included only resident applications.

 

While these figures indicate the steady progress we are making in science and technology, there is no room for complacency or to rest on our past laurels. We need to improve further and aim to be among the top nations in scientific discoveries and inventions. 

 

I am sure that we can achieve higher goals if we create the right ecosystem for innovation and creativity to thrive. Our scientific labs like CCMB should become global hubs in their respective scientific fields. Our country has highly talented and hardworking scientists and the need of the hour is to provide them with the wherewithal and encouragement to carry on with their scientific pursuits, unhindered by any kind of red tape. The youngsters in particular should be allowed to take up challenging research assignments and come up with innovative and out-of-box ideas.

 

As new technologies emerge, new challenges will also arise. But ultimately, the outcome of every scientific endeavour has to be to improve the lives of people in all aspects.

 

Scientists like you must find answers to the many challenges the world is facing today like poverty, effects of climate change, pollution, lack of clean drinking water, sanitation, increasing urbanization and growing drug resistance, among others. 

 

Issues like growing anti-microbial resistance need concerted efforts at the global level. A study in 2016 has attributed 7,00,000 deaths each year globally to anti-microbial resistance. Modern medicine is facing a serious threat on account of this problem as many antibiotics might eventually become ineffective if this trend continues unchecked. Imagine what will happen even if a common infection turns into a health threat. Apart from preventing drug resistance, there is a need to develop new antibiotics.

I am happy to know that CCMB is working in this area with focus on understanding microbial physiology. 

Also the periodic outbreak of epidemics and new viruses not only highlight our vulnerability to diseases but also underscore the need for early detection and cooperation on a global scale to contain any serious fallout. As you all aware, the newly-discovered strain of Coronavirus is spreading across nations and causing a major concern to health authorities.

Please remember that that the real wealth of a nation is determined by the health of its populace.

As India aspires for faster, sustainable and inclusive growth, the Indian Science and Technology Innovation (STI) System has a vital role to play in realising the demographic dividend and in achieving the national goals. Further India has declared 2010-20 as the “Decade of Innovation”. The Government has stressed the need to enunciate a policy to synergize science, technology and innovation and has put in place the National Innovation Council.

Since investment in STI plays a major role in promoting research and developing cutting edge technologies, I appeal to the private sector to create a fund for financing innovative scientific projects that address societal concerns. Also the funding for basic research needs to be stepped up.

I am glad that CCMB is conducting research in frontier and multi-disciplinary areas of modern biology and has trained a huge number of scientists, especially through its PhD program. I am told that of the nearly 400 PhD scholars produced from CSIR-CCMB, more than 120 are now in leadership positions in highly placed institutions in the country as well as their own biotech industry activities.

 

I am also happy to know that CCMB is analyzing India’s biodiversity as well as human origins and ancestry through genomics and genetic studies. 

I am told that CCMB’s genetic studies have provided evidence that the enigmatic tribal populations of Andaman and Nicobar islands are the first modern humans, who migrated out of Africa about 70,000 years ago. Interestingly, the migration of these people was through the coastal routes, along the eastern coast and then following the southern tip of the continent.

As regards migration patterns and genetic relatedness within the Indian population that consists of more than 5000 distinct ethnic groups, I was informed that CCMB study revealed shared ancestry for the South and North Indian populations unlike the theory of “Aryan invasion”. 

I am also glad to know that this institute is running a Genetic Diagnostic and Counselling Centre and is providing rapid and quality genetic diagnostic tests for 35 genetic disorders. It is important to predict and prevent genetic diseases as more than 70 million Indians are estimated to be suffering from genetic disorders, according to the Organization for Rare Diseases India (ORDI).

I feel that the time has come for CCMB to develop Rapid DNA Testing Kits for detection of some of the rare diseases and many other genetic disorders.  Institutions like yours must also take up campaigns on a massive scale to create awareness among the people about the health risks associated with consanguineous marriages, particularly those relating to congenital disorders.

I am sure that the recently established state of the art Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) facility will be crucial in tackling the huge genetic disease burden of India. 

I must also compliment CCMB for its efforts in wildlife conservation by establishing LaCONES (Laboratory for Conservation of Endangered Species).  I am happy to note that Scientists at LaCONES have demonstrated successful artificial insemination in spotted deer as a model for conservation of critically endangered deer species of India. The near-extinct mouse deer was also rescued by a selective breeding program and re-introduced in their native habitat. 

I am also happy to know that CCMB is extending support to life science entrepreneurs and incubating through its Common Research and Technology Development Hub (CRTDH) and Atal Incubation Centre (AIC-CCMB). I am told that currently more than 20 life science companies ranging from diagnostics, vaccines, drug discovery and repurposing, food and health are based here. 

I am also happy to learn that In the 1990s CCMB incubated the first biotech company in India – ShanthaBiotechnics. This company was instrumental in making Hepatitis B vaccine affordable to Indians by bringing down the price of the vaccine. 

I strongly believe that technology, innovation, science and research must improve the lives of the common man and benefit crucial sectors like agriculture. I am sure that CCMB with its dedicated team of scientists will come out with path-breaking results to address many of the societal concerns and improve the lives of the common. 

 

My best wishes for your future endeavors.

JAI HIND!

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today asserted that there was no scope for outside interference in India's internal matters. 

Expressing his concern over the trend of foreign bodies interfering in matters that are completely within the purview of the Indian Parliament and the Indian Government, Shri Naidu said that such efforts were totally uncalled for and unwarranted and expressed hope that they would refrain from making such statements in future.  

Addressing the gathering after releasing the book ‘TRG-An Enigma’ in New Delhi today, Shri Naidu said that as a mature Republic and democratic polity, India capable of addressing the concerns of its citizens and needs no advice or guidance in such matters from others.

“As a Republic of 70 years of experience, we have successfully withstood various challenges and have overcome several challenges. We are now more united than ever before and no one should have any concerns in this regard”, he said.

The Vice President complimented the people of our country for India’s successful 70-year long journey as a Republic and said that we as a nation will always be committed to Justice, Liberty and Equality for all of our citizens.

Asserting that our polity and democracy provided enough space for expressing differences and dissent whenever warranted, the Vice President said that whenever basic and fundamental rights of citizens came under threat, citizens rose in unison and defended them, as was seen against emergency. “As a result, we have emerged as the most vibrant democracy in the world”, he added.

Lauding Shri Tilak Raj Gupta’s distinguished contribution to education in India for over five long decades, the Vice President said that his humane management approach, along with his love and affection for students, staff and parents made him an outstanding educator. 

Emphasizing that educators of the 21st century cannot merely be content with imparting knowledge Shri Naidu said that they must serve as true role models to children. “Educators must be capable of amalgamating new technology with ancient traditions and merging new knowledge with age-old cultural values”, he added. 

The Vice President said that he had always looked upon education as a mission, something that has to be undertaken with the purest of intentions and not profit motive. He advised the best minds in each field, each discipline to turn to teaching and asked practitioners in various fields to find some time to pass on their practical experience to students.

Observing that ‘New India’ needed vibrant young thinkers who are willing to experiment and explore the various possibilities around them, he called upon the youth of the nation to become solution-makers. 

The Vice President also stressed that education was meant not just to secure employment but also for enhancement of knowledge, empowerment, and enlightenment. “Education is meaningful only if it can bring out the best in every person and make them more compassionate human beings. The need of the hour is to impart value-based education”, he said.

Referring to India’s cherished ideal of ‘Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava’, the Vice President said that secularism is one of the founding principles of the nation and is a value that is ingrained in every Indian. The Vice President also said that India is one of the most vibrant, diverse and tolerant nations in the world. 

 

Congratulating the winners of the Padma Awards that were announced recently, the Vice President also appreciated the government for recognizing these unrecognized voices. 

 

Shri. Tilak Raj Gupta, Mrs.  Pushpa Mahajan, Dr. Harsh Mahajan, and others were present on the occasion. 

 

The following is the full text of the speech: 

Shri. Tilak Raj Gupta Ji, Mrs.  Pushpa Mahajan, Mrs. & Dr. Harsh Mahajan, distinguished invitees and sisters, and brothers, 

I am delighted to release the book, “TRG- an Enigma”, which provides a unique insight to Shri. TR Gupta’s life and his distinguished contribution to education in India over five long decades. 

Shri Tilak Raj Gupta took over the Hans Raj Model School, Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi in 1970. 

The growth of the Hans Raj Model School from tents to the present beautiful complex is not only a testament of Shri T.R. Gupta’s hard work and dedication but is also a pacesetter for the 800 D.A.V. Public Schools and institutions all over the country that used this school as a model and inspiration. 

His humane management approach as a Principal cum Manager over his tenure of 25 years, along with his love and affection for students, staff and parents made him an outstanding educator. 

Shri Gupta was born into a poor family in village Der Gwar near Batala, in district Gurdaspur. From a tender age, Shri. TR Gupta was filled with nationalistic fervor and joined the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS).  

There is an impressive anecdote from his life that I was truly impressed to learn about. I am told that in 1948, during an agitation launched by the RSS was arrested and taken to District Jail, Gurdaspur. He was just 18 years old and the jailor met him and asked him to write a letter saying that he would not participate in any future protests and then he would be released. 

But the young man refused point blank and said that if his seniors in RSS called on him, he would join the agitation again. In fact, he started trying to convert the jailor to the cause of RSS. Though he failed in changing the jailor’s mind, he won his respect and admiration. 

Shri TR Gupta is also a fine orator and a talented organizer. His contributions to school education are beyond pure academics. 

I am happy to note that he introduced several Arts, Sciences and Culture based workshops in the school which ensured a great blend of scientific education with cultural values, thereby ensuring the overall development of the students. 

I appreciate him for ensuring that the weaker sections of society get quality free education, free transport, free books and free uniforms. This led the Government to follow this example and develop a policy regarding reaching of weaker sections of society in the public schools of Delhi. 

I am happy to know that his love for education also led him to set up initiatives for the promotion of adult literacy in line with the National Policy on education. His initiatives included programs for women of slum areas and vocational courses for the deprived sections of society. 

Shri. TR Gupta’s immense contribution to school education policy and programs can not be ignored. 

Let me congratulate Shri T.R. Gupta for the many accomplishments that he has amassed over the course of an illustrious career. Let me also congratulate his wife, Mrs. Pushpa Mahajan, for being a pillar of support to Shri Gupta. I am happy to know that together, they raised two children Dr. Poonam Bewtra and Dr. Harsh Mahajan who are both accomplished professionals and pillars of the community. 

My dear Sisters and Brothers, 

As a nation of young people, India has been bestowed with an enormous demographic advantage – out of a population of more than 1.25 billion, 672 million i.e. almost 50% are in the age-group 15 to 59 years.

At this critical juncture, we must ask ourselves, are our schools and universities adequately prepared to educate young people for future challenges?

Thanks to the Right to Education Act, we have successfully increased the enrolment in schools.

We have also witnessed a rise in the number of students who complete schooling. 

But we must not forget that 62 million children of school-going age, between 6 and 18 years were out-of-school in 2015.

We have also still have not been able to improve learning outcomes to the extent desired.

The solution to these problems lies in creating an education system that is built on the pillars of access, equity, quality, affordability and accountability and focuses on the creation of essential skills and the inculcation of values in our youngsters.

It should be our top priority of the country to bring out-of-school children back to schools, especially girl children. 

We must also re-imagine and re-invent our teaching, training systems to improve learning outcomes.

Educators have a crucial role to play here. 

In the 21st century, educators cannot merely be content with imparting knowledge, they must serve as true role models to children. 

They must be capable of amalgamating new technology with ancient traditions and new knowledge with age-old cultural values. 

They must shape the lives of their wards in the best manner possible so that they grow up to be ideal global citizens. 

I have always looked upon education as a mission, something that has to be undertaken with the purest of intentions and not profit motive.

Through education, you are building the nation, securing a bright future for it.  

I have felt that the best minds in each field, each discipline must turn to teaching. Practitioners in various fields especially must find some time to pass on their practical experience to students. 

This is how you give back to society.

Building a new India is no easy task. The new India requires young and vibrant young thinkers who are willing to experiment and explore the various possibilities around them. 

The youth in new India must be solution-makers. 

It is often said that it takes a whole village to raise a child and therefore along with educators, each and every one of us must work to build a conducive environment for our youngsters to flourish in. 

My dear sisters and brothers,

Though we speak of the need to educate and skill youngsters to make them employable, I strongly believe that education is not just for employment but also empowerment and enlightenment.

Swami Vivekananda once said that “education is the manifestation of perfection already in man”.

Education is meaningful only if it is able to bring out the best in every person and make them more compassionate human beings.

The need of the hour is to impart value based education.

The stress should be on inculcating values such as patience, honesty, respect, tolerance and empathy.

The youngsters need not only to be taught how to develop their skills, talents, and abilities, they must also be taught how to use these skills, talents and abilities for the welfare and betterment of the world.

They must be taught to love nature and live in harmony with all living beings. We must nurture in them a zeal to protect and conserve the environment right from a young age.

Children must also be sensitized to our rich cultural heritage and must be encouraged to pick up as many languages and practice as many art forms as they can.

Through education, we must raise a generation of young people who will not only make India a powerful economy but will also secure a position for it among the most inclusive, innovative and harmonious societies of the world.

My dear sisters and brothers, 

Our nation as a Republic completed 70 years of successful journey on the path of Constitutionalism yesterday. 

I compliment the people of our country, the political parties, the legislatures and the legislators and all other stakeholders including the media for this accomplishment.

Not many westerners gave any hope and chance for the India of 1947 to survive and last as a democracy.

While women and some other sections were discriminated in leading democracies of the world regarding voting, we adopted adult suffrage in one stroke giving voting rights to all with the adoption of our Constitution in 1950. And since then, voter participation has been steadily improving with last year’s general elections recording a high voter turn out of about 67%.

Since the first general elections in 1952, our Parliament and State Legislatures have enacted path breaking legislations aimed at socio-economic and political reforms.

Whenever, basic and fundamental rights of citizens came under threat, citizens rose in unison and defended them as was seen against emergency.

Our polity and democracy do provide enough space for expressing differences and dissent whenever warranted.

As a result, we have emerged as the most vibrant democracy in the world.

Recently, some efforts are being made outside India to comment on some laws made by the Parliament and to raise some issues based on inadequate knowledge and insufficient understanding of the issues sought to be addressed by our law makers.

Such efforts are totally uncalled for and unwarranted.

As a mature Republic and democratic polity, we are capable of addressing the concerns, if any of our citizens and we need no advice or guidance in such matters from others.

As a Republic of 70 years experience, we have successfully withstood various challenges and overcame several challenges. We are now more united than ever before and no one should have any concerns in this regard.

We as a nation are committed to the cardinal principle of ensuring Justice, Liberty and Equality for all of our citizens.

While we are capable of addressing our internal matters as evidenced over the last 70 years, let others do so in their respective domains.

My dear sisters and brothers, 

Before I conclude, let me re-iterate that the work done by trail-blazers such as Shri T.R Gupta will serve as an inspiration for generations of educators to come. 

I once again congratulate everyone who worked behind the creation of this book. I hope that the book will help the readers unravel the enigma that is Shri T.R Gupta!

Thank You!

Jai Hind!

Our Constitution is a sacred document that acts as our guiding light and moral compass. Today, let us reaffirm our commitment towards the Constitution and the cherished ideals of liberty, equality, fraternity, and justice for all, which formed the bedrock on which this great nation was built. 

Let us pledge to faithfully discharge our constitutionally mandated Fundamental Duties and be responsible citizens who will be proactive partners in the nation’s development.

Let this Republic Day further fortify the unity and integrity of this vast and diverse nation. Let this strong bond of unity of purpose be the driving force of all our endeavors to build an inclusive, prosperous, progressive, peaceful and harmonious nation.”

                The Adhoc Committee of the Rajya instituted by Chairman Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has made 40 far reaching recommendations to prevent sexual abuse of children and to contain access to and transmission of child pornography content on the social media. The report of the Committee was today presented by the Chairman of the Committee Shri Jai Ram Ramesh to Shri Naidu. 

The initiative of Shri Naidu in setting up of such a Committee to examine and report on an issue of such a wider social concern is the first of it’s kind and has been widely appreciated. Shri Jairam Ramesh in the Report of the Committee stated that it is a good model that can be followed from time to time to get members of Rajya Sabha to deliberate on pressing social issues.

Expressing concern over the seriousness of the prevalence of the horrific social evil of child pornography, the Committee has recommended important amendments to the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 besides technological, institutional, social and educational measures and state level initiatives to address the alarming issue of pornography on social media and its effects on children and the society as a whole.

The 40 recommendations made by the Adhoc Committee relate to adoption of a broader definition of child pornography, controlling access for children to such content, containing generation and dissemination of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), making accountable the Internet Service Providers and online platforms for denying access to children and removing such obscene content from online sites besides monitoring, detection and removal of content, preventing under-age use of such content, enabling parents for early detection of accessing such content by children, enabling effective action by the governments and authorized agencies to take necessary preventive and penal measures etc.

Noting that the purveyors of child pornography seem always to be one step ahead of the regulators, the Committee stressed on the need for implementation of its recommendations as an integrated package of measures and not piecemeal to have any value and impact. The Committee urged the Prime Minister to take up the subject of child pornography and the measures required to combat it in one of his forthcoming 'Man Ki Baat' broadcast besides taking the lead in building up a global political alliance to combat child pornography on social media like the International Solar Alliance initiative.

The Committee has broadly sought to address two main issues viz., access of children to pornographic material on social media and circulation of pornographic material on social media in which children are abused. The major recommendations of the Committee has given as under:

Legislative measures


	The Committee has recommended some important amendments to the POCSO Act, 2012 and the IT Act, 2000 with corresponding changes to be carried out in the Indian Penal Code;
	A clause to be inserted in the POCSO Act, 2012 under which advocating or counseling sexual activities with a person under the age of 18 years through any written material, visual representation or audio recording or any characterization is made an offence under the Act;
	Another clause to be inserted in the POCSO Act, 2012 prescribing a Code of Conduct for intermediaries (online platforms) for maintaining child safety online, ensuring age appropriate content and curbing use of children for pornographic purposes;
	Under the POCSO Act, 2012, school management should be responsible for safety of children within schools, transportation services and any other programmes with which the school is associated;
	National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal shall be designated as the national portal under reporting requirements in POCSO Act in case of electronic material;
	A new section be included in the IT Act 2000, providing for punitive measures for those providing pornographic access to children and also those who access, produce or transmit Child Sexual Abuse Material(CSAM);
	Union Government shall be empowered through its designated authority to block and/or prohibit all websites/intermediaries that carry child sexual abuse material;
	IT Act to be modified making intermediaries responsible for all measures to proactively identify and remove CSAM as well as report it to Indian authorities as well besides the foreign authorities. Gateway Internet Service Providers (ISP's) must bear a significant liability to detect and block CSAM websites. Intermediaries shall also be responsible to report to the designated authority, IP addresses/identities of all those searching/accessing child porn/CSAM key words;


Technology measures


	Law enforcement agencies be permitted to brake end to end encryption to trace distributors of child pornography. Apps that help in monitoring children's access to pornographic content shall be made mandatory on all devices sold in India. Such Apps or similar solutions to be developed and made freely available to ISP, companies, schools and parents;
	Ministry of Electronics and IT and Ministry of Home Affairs shall coordinate with Blockchain analysis companies to trace identities of users engaging in crypto currency transactions to purchase child pornography online. Online payment portals and credit cards be prohibited from processing payments for any pornographic website;
	ISPs shall be required to provide family friendly filters to parents at the point of sign up to regulate children's access to internet content;
	All social media platforms should be mandated with minimum essential technologies to detect Child Sexual Abuse Material besides regular reporting to law enforcement agencies in the country;
	On-streaming platforms like Netflix and social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook etc. should have separate adult section where under- aged children could be disallowed;
	Social media shall have mechanism for age verification and restricting access to objectionable/obscene material;


Institutional measures


	The Committee recommended an upgraded and technologically empowered National Commission for Protection of Child Rights(NCPCR) to be designated as the nodal agency to deal with the issue of child pornography. NCPCR should have necessary technological, cyber policing and prosecution capabilities;
	The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shall mandatorily record and report annually cases of child pornography of all kinds. A national Tipline Number should be created where child sexual abuse as well as distribution of child pornographic material can be reported by concerned citizens;


Social and Educational measures


	Ministries of Women and Child Development and Information and Broadcasting shall launch campaigns for greater awareness among parents to recognize early signs of child abuse, online risks and improving online safety for their child. Schools shall undertake training programmes for parents at least twice a year, making them aware of hazards for children of free access to smart phones, internet at an early age. Based on the experiences of other countries, a proper practicable policy for restricting use of smart phones by under aged kids needs to be considered;


State level implementation


	The committee recommended that each State and Union Territory shall have empowered State Commission for the Protection for Child Rights mirroring capabilities and capacities of the NCPCR. E-safety Commissioners be appointed at state level to ensure implementation of social media and website guidelines relating to removal of pornographic content, age verification, issuing warnings etc.


 

The 14-member Committee including 7 women members of Rajya Sabha was set up by Shri Venkaiah Naidu on December 12 last year further to some members voicing concern over widespread misuse of social media for accessing pornographic content and child abuse.

The Committee heard the views of the Ministries of Women and Child Development, Electronics and IT and Home Affairs besides NCPCR and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and other stakeholders like Google, Facebook, Whatsapp, Bytedance(TikTok), Twitter and Sharechat.

The Committee also received representations from 3 NGOs viz., HERD Educational & Medical Research Foundation, Nagpur, Centre for Child Rights, New Delhi and Internet Freedom Foundation, New Delhi.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called for a total war on corruption and described corruption as a major canker which skews growth and development, deepens poverty and increases inequality.

Delivering the ‘IC Centre for Governance Sardar Patel Lecture on Governance’ at Upa Rashtrapati Niwas, Shri Naidu said that various transformative policies and programmes like Beti Bachao, Beti Padao, Ayushman Bharat, Goods and Services Tax and ‘Swachh Bharat’ are aimed at accelerating the progress and empowering people. “We can accomplish the desired goals only if we have a robust governance system and there is an unflinching commitment to excellence at every level”, he added. 

He asked the bureaucracy to be more proactive and ensure that there was no gap in the intent, execution and delivery of various services to the people. 

Observing that it was critical for the state institutions to be agile, adaptable and resilient in the rapidly changing 21st century, he called for strengthening program implementation, improving competence and credibility of institutional structures and adopting a work ethic that keeps national interest at the top and public welfare at its core. 

Wondering whether degeneration in moral and social values in the society has led to a general decline in the functioning of public services at every level, Shri Naidu called for an introspection and said that it was imperative to initiate a movement of ethics at all levels in governance of the country. 

The Vice President said that there was a need to foster public trust in institutions and the integrity of public officials, while injecting greater accountability into decision-making. “I feel that it is imperative that a movement of ethics is initiated at all levels in governance of the country”, he added. 

Asserting that people must be at the center of an effective and just governance system, Shri Naidu called for efforts to ensure that the poorest of the poor and most deserving gets the benefits of government schemes. “Perhaps, we need Process Reengineering in governance. We don’t have to change the system, as is being suggested in some quarters, but we have to make the system work better”, he added. 

Paying glowing tributes to Sardar Patel, he described him as the unifier and Iron Man of modern India. 

Observing that India owed a huge debt of gratitude to Sardar Patel for unifying the nation into a single territorial entity, the Vice President said that nothing mattered more to Sardar Patel than the interests of the nation.

The Vice President said that Sardar Patel wanted the All India Services, which he conceived as a ‘steel-frame’ of the nation, to provide people-centric governance. “With a clear vision for an efficient administrative system, Sardar Patel wanted the civil servants to maintain the highest standards of probity and efficiency and strive to uplift the conditions of the poor without any fear or favour”, he added. 

In this context he recalled that the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to Indian Union was total, final and irrevocable. He also pointed out that Article 370 was only a temporary provision and said that it had outlived its purpose long back. 

The Vice President said that unity and consensus on larger issues facing the country was the need of the hour. He advised people to develop a positive outlook and not become cynical. He urged the youngsters in particular to adopt a constructive approach towards nation building. 

The Vice President said that all Indians must work together, a collective endeavour, for ushering in Gandhi Ji’s Ram Rajya, where there is all-round inclusive growth without poverty, discrimination, inequality, illiteracy and hunger. ‘Every citizen must strive to protect the unity, safety, security and sovereignty of the country’, he added. 

Shri Prabhat Kumar, Former Cabinet Secretary & Former Governor of Jharkhand and President, IC Centre for Governance, Shri Harivansh, Hon’ble Deputy Chairman, Rajya Sabha and others were present on the occasion.

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am delighted that the 'IC Center for Governance Sardar Patel Lecture on Governance' is being held here at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Conference Hall at Uparashtrapati Bhavan today. 

I welcome you all to the official residence of the Vice President of India. It gives me immense pleasure to deliver this lecture at this conference hall named after the great son of the soil, the unifier and the Iron Man of modern India – Shri Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. 

Firstly, let me remind every Indian that each one of us owes a huge debt of gratitude to Shri Sardar Patel for unifying India into a single territorial entity by spectacularly bringing about the merger of more than 560 princely States with the Union of India at its most critical point in the country’s history. 

Had he not displayed vision, firmness, pragmatism and tact in nipping in the bud even the remotest thought of a few princely States to remain independent or join Pakistan, India’s geographical contours would have been totally different.

In this context, it is pertinent to recall that the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian Union by Raja Hari Singh was without conditions. As such it is irrevocable and final. Another aspect is that Article 370 was only a temporary provision and had outlived its purpose long back. With the abrogation of the Article 370, the Union Territories of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh will witness all-round and faster development.

It was our good fortune that Shri Patel was entrusted with the most challenging assignment during India’s turbulent time and the country found the man of the moment in him. It undoubtedly was one of the greatest accomplishments of the 20th century.

Patel knew that India was under foreign rule because of a lack of unity. Pointing out that our mutual conflicts and internecine quarrels and jealousies in the past had been the cause of our downfall and falling victims to foreign domination several times, he had cautioned “We cannot afford to fall into those errors or traps again.”

Nothing mattered more than the interests of the nation for Shri Sardar Patel. 

Apart from ensuring the territorial integrity of the country, he had conceived and created the administrative steel-frame, All India Services, to provide people-centric governance.

Dear sisters and brothers,

Shri Patel wanted post-independent India to stay united without any narrow considerations and divisions based on caste, creed, religion or language. With a clear vision for an efficient administrative system, he wanted the civil servants to maintain the highest standards of probity and efficiency and strive to uplift the conditions of the poor without any fear or favour. 

Addressing the Probationers of the first batch of Indian Administrative Service, Sardar Patel said, “The service will now have to adopt its true role of national service, without being trammeled by traditions and habits of the past”. 

He was equally keen to ensure that the governance system empowers the rural India and protects farmers’ interests.

As you all are aware, governance has been an enduring subject of discussion among practitioners and laymen alike for many years now. 

As I see it, governance is an overarching concept with many dimensions and institutional and political manifestations. Conventionally understood, governance is the way the state and its various institutions negotiate and mediate with people, markets and civil society, through laws, policies, regulation and finance.

The concept of governance has grown beyond the conventional definition. The process of governance is increasingly influenced by market forces as well as civil-society processes and citizen initiatives.

The discourse on governance has grown as a parallel discourse to that of civil society, human rights and globalization. It also provides institutional and legal interfaces through which citizens mediate and interact with the state and seek accountability.

A just, people-centred and inclusive growth approach seeks to transform political and governance processes. Its purpose is social transformation through the realization of rights to all people, and political transformation to challenge unjust power relationships within and among institutions at the national and local level.

Has the degeneration in moral and social values in the society led to a general decline in the functioning of our public services at every level? There needs to be an honest introspection at every level to arrest the declining standards. 

It should be always remembered that people have to be at the centre of an effective and just governance system. It must necessarily aim at empowerment of all people in an inclusive manner by providing a transparent and efficient institutional framework and the rule of law.

The right to information is likewise an essential prerequisite for a robust, informed public debate through which decision-makers become answerable to their people, and rights-holders are enabled to assess public and private sector conduct. 

Just governance is about ensuring that those vested with authority are not allowed to become corrupted by their power. 

Just governance holds decision-makers accountable for actions or omissions. It, therefore, can help foster public trust in institutions and the integrity of public officials, while injecting greater accountability into decision-making. 

I feel that it is imperative that a movement of ethics is initiated at all levels in governance of the country. 

Corruption is a major canker and has to be relentlessly fought at every level. It is said that corruption skews growth and development, affects the economy, deepens poverty and increases inequalities. It sustains informal power structures. 

In this era of Information Technology, corruption can be best compared to a computer virus. The hardware looks the same; the software generally works, but some part of it gets “corrupted” and you find yourself in danger of losing the whole system. Like the virus, corruption may be invisible, small, contained to a few people, but like the virus, its mere existence in an organization puts everything at risk. 

We have to declare a total war on corruption which has to become a people’s movement.

I think the system of governance adopted by our constitution makers and national leaders after independence has substantially stood the test of time. It is reflected in the national and political stability and has also, to an extent, aided in the development and economic progress. One can reasonably conclude that the system is capable of managing change from time to time, as observed in managing the economic reforms in the last two decades, and in making progress in many key development sectors.

That is not to say that the system is perfect or that its functioning has been without any defects. I am only saying that the system, if followed honestly and efficiently, is capable of taking care of the problems of the people. Also, in my view, there is no other system of governance more suited to the plurality of our country.

The same, however, cannot be said at the level of institutions and the processes in government. Perhaps, we need Process Reengineering in governance. We don’t have to change the system, as is being suggested in some quarters, but we have to make the system work better. 

In the last few years, several administrative and legal reforms were initiated to bring in transparency and accountability. They include measures to curb corruption, unearth black money, and promote ease of doing business and speedy delivery of services to the beneficiary in a hassle-free manner.

In view of increasing globalization, there is a need to take  action against economic fugitives who should not find any safe havens anywhere in the world.  There should be greater cooperation at the international level. Various countries must not only exchange information but also enter into extradition treaties. The United Nations must take the lead in this regard.

The implementation of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was another important reform undertaken by the government.

Promoting the use of IT for the delivery of services is equally important to control corruption and ensure transparency. Everything should be online so that people need not stand in line. Direct Benefit Transfer through JAM (Janadhan-Aadhar-Mobile) is a fine example of the use of technology to eliminate bogus beneficiaries and check corruption.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s three-word mantra of ‘Reform, Perform and Transform’ seeks to bring in total transformation in all walks of life. A responsible citizenry, honest political class, ethical bureaucracy and a vibrant judiciary will help India to become a role model for others.

Public institutions are at the heart of governance. Good governance thrives on good institutions.  

To deliver public services, we have a number of public institutions. The overall performance of the government can be judged by an aggregation of performances of these public institutions.

It should be remembered that in a rapidly changing world, public institutions cannot remain rigid. They need to suitably change their ways of functioning to meet the mounting aspirations of the people. We have to do away with lot of outdated and time-consuming procedures and increasingly use IT to promote transparency and provide efficient delivery of services.

What we need today is effective implementation of laws and policies. The bureaucracy must take the lead in the transformation of institutions. These institutions must be instruments of effective and efficient delivery of public services and socio-economic development.  

They should have credibility and competence. 

The integrity of the governance institutions is very essential. They should be transparent and accountable in respect of everything they do.

In the rapidly changing 21st century, it is critical that state institutions are agile, adaptable and resilient. The bureaucracy must become more pro-active and ensure that there is no gap in the intent, execution and delivery of various services to the people.

Various transformative policies and programmes like Beti Bachao, Beti Padao, Ayushman Bharat, Goods and Services Tax,  ‘Swachh Bharat’, ‘Make-in-India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Start-up India’, and ‘Skill India’  are aimed at accelerating the progress and empowering people. We can accomplish the desired goals only if we have a robust governance system and there is an unflinching commitment to excellence at every level.

Taking a leaf out of Sardar Patel’s life and the extraordinary mission accomplished by him, I would suggest that we focus on strengthening programme implementation; on building up the competence and credibility of institutional structures and adopting a work ethic that keeps the national interest at the top and public welfare at its core. 

People need to develop a positive outlook and not become cynical. Everybody, particularly the youngsters, should adopt a constructive approach towards nation building. Through a collective endeavour, all Indians must work together for ushering in Gandhi Ji’s Ram Rajya , where there is all-round inclusive growth without poverty, fear, corruption, discrimination, inequality, illiteracy and hunger.

Every citizen must strive to protect the unity, safety, security and sovereignty of the country. 

I am sure that all those involved in delivering public services will rise to the occasion and strive to make India one of the best countries in the world in providing citizen-centric governance. 

JAI HIND

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today said that time has come to revisitour history textbooks and to give adequate importance to freedom fighters from all parts of the country. 

Unveiling the statue of NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose in Raj Bhawan, Chennai, on the occasion of his Birth Anniversary today, the Vice President said that the history should inspire our children and they should read the life stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle.

Shri Naidu expressed disappointment that many of the stalwarts of Indian independence movement, such as SardarVallabhbhai Patel, NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose, Veer Savarkar, Shri Chidambaram Pillai, Subramania Bharti, AlluriSeetharamaRaju and VeerapandiyaKattabomman did not find adequate place in our history text books.

He further said that the history should be comprehensive and re-capture our past glory and instill a sense of pride in India’s rich culture and heritage.

Referring to the sufferings underwent by several freedom fighters at Cellular Jail including Veer Savarkar, the Vice President said that some people are trying to belittle their contributions, either due to ignorance or due to their leanings. 

Calling upon the youth to take inspiration from the life of NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose, Shri Naidu asked themto strive towards building a progressive, harmonious and inclusive India.

The Vice President also said that Netaji’s vision and his nationalistic outlook can be an important guiding light for building a New India.

Referring to the diversity of philosophies and approaches in our freedom struggle, the Vice President said it was a bouquet of individual and collective actions, ranging from peaceful satyagraha to more organized resistance.

“Even as Gandhiji was turning ‘ahimsa’ into a powerful weapon of our struggle, the likes of Bhagat Singh and Subhash Chandra Bose continued with their efforts of unsettling the British”, he said.

Although Gandhiji was not in favor of Netaji’s militant approach, he respected him and once referred to him as the 'patriot of patriots'.

Highlighting his leadership of Azad Hind Fauj, Shri Naidu said that Netaji Bose unfurled the Tricolor in Port Blair on 30th December 1943 and declared Andaman and Nicobar Islands to be the first Indian Territory to be free from British Raj.

Recalling the close connection of the people of Tamil Nadu with Indian National Army, the Vice President paid rich tributes to Shri MuthuramalingaThevar who was a close confidante of Netaji. 

“Shri MuthuramalingaThevar was an influential leader who was instrumental in establishing Shri Subhash Chandra Bose’s strong presence in Tamil imagination”, Shri Naidu said. Shri MuthuramalingaThevar also launched a Tamil Weekly Nethaji and was one of the founding pillars of Forward Bloc. 

He had played an instrumental role in mobilizing huge support for INA, VP said.

He also lauded the daredevilry of Lakshmi Swaminathan who had had set up the Rani of Jhansi Regiment in INA and came to be known as Captain Lakshmi Sahgal.

Expressing pride in the fact that we Indians are inheritors of a five thousands years old civilization, Shri Naidu highlighted that Netaji firmly believed in our civilizational values and its history. This history should form the bedrock of our national pride and collective self-confidence, he added.

Lauding the Government’s decision to declassify all records and files associated with Netaji, the Vice President said that researchers will now be able to delve deep into his life and come up with many more meaningful publications on the life story of this great patriot.

The statue of NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose unveiled in Raj Bhawan, Chennai today has been sponsored by BharatiyaVidyaBhawan.

The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri BanwariLalPurohit, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Speaker of Tamil Nadu Legislature Assembly, Shri P. Dhanapal, Deputy Chief Minister, Shri O. Paneerselvam,Chairman of BhartiyaVidyaBhawan N. Raviwere among the dignitaries who graced the occasion at Raj Bhawan.

Following is the full text of the speech – 

“I am pleased to unveil the statue of NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose -- one of the most illustrious sons of mother India. His clarion call of 'Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom' inspired millions to fight for the nation. He still lives in our hearts.

We in India are the inheritors of the legacy of a great civilization that is more than five thousand years old and had faced several upheavals and tumultuous moments throughout history.

A major landmark in the modern history of our country is the gaining of Independence from British rule.

Given the riches of our motherland, many had set their eyes on our country from the Huns to the English, Our freedom struggle was marked by a variety of philosophies, thoughts, and approaches. It was a bouquet of individual and collective actions, ranging from peaceful satyagraha to more organized resistance.

As the struggle was still to acquire force, momentum and mass acknowledgment, Gandhiji returned to India in 1915 and gave it a direction and collective identity.

Even as Gandhiji was turning ‘ahimsa’ into a powerful weapon of our struggle, the likes of Bhagat Singh continued with their efforts of unsettling the British.

Netaji was another leader, who had left an indelible imprint on the freedom struggle—he had stirred the imagination of millions of countrymen through his thoughts, words, and deeds.

Shri Subhash Chandra Bose or ‘Netaji’, as he is fondly known as, is one of the most revered freedom fighters of India. His charismatic personality made him a natural leader, especially among the youth.

Shri Subhash Chandra Bose was the son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer.

In his youth, he was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda's teachings and was known for his patriotic zeal. 

He studied at the prestigious Presidency College, Calcutta, from which he was expelled for nationalistic activities in 1916. He later graduated from the Scottish Churches College and went to London, where he passed the Indian Civil Service examination in 1920. However, he had resigned from the coveted service in April 1921 and hurried back to India as the struggle for independence gathered momentum.

Netaji joined the non-cooperation movement started by Gandhiji and became a youth educator, journalist, and commandant of the volunteers of Bengal. 

He was arrested and jailed several times and deported for his nationalistic activities. In 1938, Netaji was elected president of the Indian National Congress and formed a National Planning Committee, which formulated a policy of broad industrialization.

Although he was supportive of Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals initially, the two leaders gradually drifted apart. Netaji along with the younger group of leaders wanted ‘complete self-rule and without any compromise’ for India whereas the older, more moderate leadership was in favor of the ‘dominion status for India within the British rule’.

Although Gandhiji was not in favor of Netaji’s militant approach, he respected him and once referred to him as the 'patriot of patriots'. 

Netaji founded the All India Forward Bloc in a bid to unify the more radical elements in the struggle for independence but was again incarcerated in 1940. He refused to remain in prison at this crucial period of India’s history and went on a fast to death.

The British government had to relent and was forced to release him.

Inspired by Shri Subhash Chandra Bose, Azad Hind an Indian Provisional government was formed by Indian nationalists in exile in 1943 in Singapore with the support of Japan. Bose also took leadership of the Azad Hind Fauj.

  On 6th November 1943, the then Prime Minister of Japan had declared in the Tokyo Assembly of Greater East Asiatic Nations that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be transferred to the provisional Government, Azad Hind.

The Japanese imperial forces were in occupation of these islands from 23rd March 1943 during the World War.

NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose unfurled the Tricolor in Port Blair on 30th December 1943 and declared Andaman and Nicobar Islands to be the first Indian Territory to be freed from British Raj.

Netaji was the Supreme Commander of Azad Hind Fauj and head of the state of the provisional government of Azad Hind.

Let me now touch upon the connection of the people of this State with the INA. As you all are aware, if there was one individual instrumental in establishing Shri Subhash Chandra Bose’s strong presence in Tamil imagination, it has got to be MuthuramalingaThevar.

He was an influential leader and a close confidante of Netaji. He was also one of the founding pillars of Forward Bloc and had played an instrumental role in mobilizing huge support for INA. He also launched a Tamil Weekly Nethaji.

Of course, the daredevilry of Lakshmi Swaminathan (famously known as Captain Lakshmi Sahgal) is well known. She had set up the Rani of Jhansi Regiment in INA and came to be known as Captain Lakshmi Sahgal (her husband Prem Kumar Sahgal also served in the INA). Another Tamil Malaysian woman, JanakyAthiNahappan, Malaysian freedom fighter and social activist, RasammahBhupalan also joined Rani of Jhansi regiment. As a 14 year old, Janaky once attended a rally of Bose and was so enthralled by his idealism that she handed over her expensive earring to INA as a part of fund raising drive.

I recently visited the 150-foot high flag mast built to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the unfurling of the National Flag by Netaji, at Port Blair in Andaman and Nicobar. The Prime Minister, Shri NarendraModi had unfurled the Tricolor at the 150-foot high mast at Port Blair in 2018.

Netaji firmly believed in our civilization and its values and its history which should form the bedrock of our national pride and collective self-confidence. He was spiritual and an intellectual genius.

NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose was one of the tallest leaders of India’s struggle for independence. I pay my humble tributes to this great son of India on the occasion of his birth anniversary today.

I also pay my respects today to all the freedom fighters, including Veer Savarkar, who had bravely fought against the British in the face of the most daunting odds. Veer Savarkar was given two life sentences and imprisoned for 10 years in the infamous cellular jail, where he was subjected to inhuman treatment. 

Unfortunately, some people are trying to belittle his invaluable contribution to the nationalistic cause and the freedom struggle. 

I feel that our history textbooks must highlight the life stories of our national icons like SardarVallabhbhai Patel, NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose, Veer Savarkar, Shri Chidambaram Pillai, Subramania Bharti and AlluriSeetharamaRaju who were not given due recognition. We must continue to take inspiration from their sacrifices and strive to build a strong, inclusive, progressive, peaceful and harmonious nation.

My dear sisters and brothers,

India has been independent for more than seven decades now.

Certainly, substantial progress has been achieved on all fronts during these decades. 

But much more needs to be done. Pockets of poverty, illiteracy, inequality, poor infrastructure, poor sanitation, and social evils continue to haunt us.

We have to build an India where every Indian has an equal opportunity and inspired by a shared and common sense of pride. Let’s build an India, where every Indian is empowered through education, health and economic opportunities to unleash his or her inner and creative energies for the individual and common good.

As we seek to surmount the contemporary challenges to build a ‘New India’, there is so much to draw from the life and struggle of Netaji, his vision and his nationalistic outlook.

Today, India is at a cusp of transformation. It has the largest youth population in the world-65 percent of its population is below 35 years of age.

This youth population will determine India’s future.

We must channelize the creative energy of this tremendous youth population into creative pursuits for nation-building.

Netaji was a very popular youth icon. Very few leaders have inspired the youth of our country like Netaji has. He can be the guiding light for the Indian youth of the 21st century.

I urge the youth of our nation to take inspiration from his life, his adherence to discipline, his dedication to the cause at hand, his courage and conviction, his resilience and his uncorrupted idealism. 

He was a man of action as well as thought.

To a certain extent, the details of his life are shrouded in mystery. The government has recently declassified all records and files associated with Netaji and made them available to the National Archives of India.

This is indeed a laudable step. More researchers will now be able to delve deep into his life and come up with many more meaningful publications on the life story of this great patriot and his relentless struggle for freeing India from the clutches of the British.

The government has also opened a Subhash Chandra Bose museum at the iconic Red Fort to mark the leader's 122nd birth anniversary in 2019.

Such memorials and symbols such as this statue will keep the memory of Netaji alive in the consciousness of this nation.

On the 123rd Birth Anniversary of this great patriot, I bow my head in reverence to the great soul.

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today stressed the need to reorient the education system and improve the quality of teaching and research in our institutions of Higher Education.

Addressing the convocation of Vikrama Simhapuri University, in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh today, the Vice President expressed concern over the fact that none of our universities has figured among the top 100 Universities of the world in Times Rankings.

Addressing the students, Shri Naidu said, “India was once known as Vishwaguru and knowledge-seekers from all over the world used to come and study at renowned learning centres like Nalanda and Takshashila. Our students must draw inspiration from our glorious past to create a magnificent future.”

Highlighting that India has the advantage of Demographic dividend, the Vice President said that the development of knowledge and skills of youth should be the key strategy for accelerating economic growth of the nation. This trained and educated human capital will play an important role in achieving the goal of 5 trillion dollar economy in the coming years.

In this regard, Shri Naidu emphasized the need to step up the investment in education from the current 4.6 percent of GDP to 6 percent of GDP, as recommended by the NITI Aayog.

Stressing the need for our universities to emerge as the hotspots of research, incubation and innovation, Vice President called for building a strong research ecosystem through collaborative, inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary research initiatives. 

Expressing concerns that India’s expenditure on R & D has almost stagnated, he said one reason for this was low investment by private sector in research and development.

The Vice President urged the private sector to spend reasonable share on research and development and join hands with the Universities. He also asked the corporate sector to create a separate corpus to promote cutting edge research in higher education institutions and universities.

Maintaining that Universities too must maintain close interaction with the industry, the Vice President called for creating the right ecosystem for research to thrive. It should be remembered that ultimately every scientific outcome must benefit the society, he said.

Shri Naidu further said asked the private universities to consider the education as a mission and as an investment in the future of the country and not merely treat it as a business opportunity. “Private universities need to focus on ensuring inclusiveness and deploy more resources to educate children belonging to the under-privileged sections of the society”, he added.

Talking of the need to provide holistic education, the Vice President said it should turn students into the persons of sterling character, impeccable integrity and strong morals. They must be socially conscientious citizens with empathy and compassion for the less fortunate, he added.

Shri Naidu also said that the education policy must focus on teaching India’s culture, heritage and the rich history with life stories of the great men and women who shaped this great nation.

Maintaining that education is not just for employment rather it is for enlightenment and empowerment, the Vice President asked the students to be life-long learners. “The growth and development of this country depends upon how well-educated, hard working and enterprising the youth are. The strides of progress that you make in your individual careers will collectively determine the pace at which the nation progresses”, he told the students.

The Vice President also asked the students to spare their time for societal obligations also. He appreciated Vikrama Simhapuri University’s concept of ‘College to Village’ in this regard.

Expressing concerns over the global warming and climate change, Shri Naidu also called upon every university to involve students in campaigns for the protection of the environment.

The Governor of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Biswabhushan Harichandan and the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. R. Sudarsana Rao were among the dignitaries who graced the occasion.

Following is the full text of the speech –

“It is a privilege for me to be here today to deliver the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Convocations address.  I am always happy to come to my home town, Nellore and cherish the flood of memories that flit through my mind. 

Vikrama Simhapuri University is the pride of Nellore District and a feather in the cap of Nellore City. The long cherished goal of the people of Nellore District was realized when the University was established in 2008, opening new vistas for higher education to the youth in this rural areas. 

I am glad to note that the University has made excellent of progress and has earned a place of great repute for itself. 

My dear graduating students, 

Convocation is a crucial day in the life of every student.

 The degrees that you receive today are rewards for your hard work, dedication, commitment and above all, your talent. This day marks the culmination of your student life and the beginning of a new chapter in your life. A long and arduous journey lies ahead of you and I trust that you will choose to find your own, unique path to success. 

But always bear in mind that the end of student-life does not mean the end of education. I urge you to be life-long learners, continuously polishing and perfecting your intellect and your talent so that they shine bright and bring light into the lives of countless number of people. 

Today, you leave the portals of the University campus and enter into a world full of opportunities and challenges. You have to face those challenges with equanimity, determination and grit and strive to turn every single opportunity that lies ahead of you into a success story.

The growth and development of this country depends upon how well-educated, hard working and enterprising the youth are. The strides of progress that you make in your individual careers will collectively determine the pace at which the nation progresses. 

Though having a rewarding and successful career is important, I fervently believe that education is not just for employment. It is for enlightenment, enhancement of knowledge and empowerment. Education is the means to bring out the best in man. 

The renowned poet Sri Bhartruhari rightly stated that education leads to prosperity, progress, well-being, social reputation and government patronage. 

“విద్య నిగూఢ గుప్తమగు విత్తము రూపము పూరుషాళికిన్
విద్య యశస్సు భోగకరి విద్య గురుండు విదేశబంధుడున్
విద్య విశిష్ట దైవతము విద్యకు సాటి ధనంబు లే దిలన్
విద్య నృపాల పూజితము విద్య నేరుంగనివాడు మర్త్యుడే.”

My dear sisters and brothers, 

In the last few decades, India witnessed a significant expansion of higher education especially after 1990s. 

The number of Universities and deemed to be Universities increased just from 30 to nearly 800, of which almost one third are privately managed. The most important fact to reckon with is that in higher education, private management institutions account for more than 60 percent of the total institutions and of total enrolment. 

This kind of situation has its own bearing on opportunities to different social groups and the quality of education. 

The private universities of our country must consider education as a mission and as an investment in the future of the country without treating it as a mere business opportunity. Private universities need to focus on ensuring inclusiveness and deploy more resources to educate children belonging to the under-privileged sections of the society. 

It is also pertinent to note that the quality of teaching and research at present in many of the Universities in the country is lagging behind compared to the developed countries.  

This is evident from the rankings of Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2018. None of our universities has figured among the top 100 Universities, while at least two from China are among top 25 Universities. This underscores the imperative need to reorient the education system and improve the standards of teaching in our institutions of Higher Education. 

The education system should not only focus on academic excellence but develop the students into holistic individuals. The students coming out of the portals of higher education institutions should be persons of sterling character, impeccable integrity and strong morals. They must be socially conscientious citizens with empathy and compassion for the less fortunate. 

The education policy must also focus on teaching India’s culture, heritage and the rich history with life stories of the great men and women who shaped this great nation.

Please remember that India was once known as Vishwaguru and knowledge-seekers from all over the world used to come and study at renowned learning centres like Nalanda and Takshashila. Our students must draw inspiration from our glorious past to create a magnificent future.

It is true that the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) has recorded significant increase from 19 per cent in 2010-11 to 25.8 per cent by 2017-18.  The targeted GER is to achieve 30 per cent by 2020. 

But mere increase in GER is not just enough as quality of education is more important than the increase in numbers.  

There is also a need to step up our investment in education from the current 4.6 percent of GDP to 6 percent of GDP, as recommended by the NITI Aayog.

In fact, education as human capital needs more emphasis at present than ever before as Government of India has set a cherished goal of achieving US $5 trillion economy in the coming years. 

This lofty goal can be realized only when governments at different levels invest adequately on quality education and research. It may be noted that the economic growth and development of a country depends on the quality of manpower in terms of knowledge, skills and competencies. Development of knowledge and skills of manpower in general and the educated youth in particular should be the key strategy for accelerating economic growth of a nation. 

It is widely acknowledged that India has the advantage of Demographic dividend. Demographic dividend is the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population’s age structure, mainly when the share of the working age population is larger than the non-working age share of the population. 

Since 2018, India’s working age population (People between 15 and 64 years of age) has grown larger than the dependant population. This kind of bulge in the working population is going to last till 2055, it is estimated.  

This large work force not only does increase the pace of economic growth in India but also would be available to other countries in the world.  But this will be facilitated only when young and inquisitive people like you are equipped with necessary skills and knowledge.

Our students who are well equipped with computer, communication and quantitative skills are very much in demand in many parts of the world. Mere degrees and diplomas will not make a person employable. Skilling is as important as giving information and knowledge.

 Studies conducted by MHRD, Government of India revealed recently that our graduates are lagging behind in this respect.  Therefore, your degree and diploma need to be supplemented by appropriate skills to take full advantage of the innumerable opportunities in the globalised and liberalized economic environment. 

Universities should not only be the knowledge hubs but also need to emerge as the hotspots of research, incubation and innovation.  There is a great need to build a strong research ecosystem by collaborative, inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary research initiatives. 

Expenditure on Research and Development is a key indicator of private and public sectors effort to foster competitive advantage in Science and Technology. But in India, public expenditure on Research and Development is very low.  

The percentage of public expenditure in GDP hovers around 0.8 per cent. It is well below the developed countries like USA, Israel, Japan and Korea and also a developing country like China. 

Even though the East Asian countries have increased their spending as they have become richer, India’s expenditure on R & D has almost stagnated. One important reason for this is the negligible share of the private sector in the investment on research and development. 

I appeal to the private sector to spend reasonable share on research and development and join hands with the Universities. In fact, I have been advocating the corporate sector to create a separate corpus to promote cutting edge research in higher education institutions and universities.

The Universities too must maintain close interaction with the industry and create the right ecosystem for research to thrive. It should be remembered that ultimately every scientific outcome must benefit the society. 

I am happy to know that Vikrama Simhapuri University has decided to organize University - Industry Interaction Workshop every year on 14th February.

My dear graduating students,

Besides your academic and career obligations, you have to spare your time for societal obligations also. 

I am happy to note that the University has established a centre for extension to undertake extension and outreach programs to motivate faculty and students to take-up initiatives of social responsibility.  

The concept followed by the University, ‘College to Village’ is also appreciable. 

Every university must involve students in campaigns for the protection of the environment. Global warming and climate change are real and the world is witnessing many adverse events like increasing heat waves, droughts and hurricanes. Many people were killed and tens of thousands of animals perished in the devastating bush fires that swept through Australia recently. 

I have always been advocating the importance of preserving culture and protecting nature for a better future. I appreciate that University has undertaken 64,800 plantations of 12 varieties of saplings on the Campus and has started the innovative initiative of Students Green Club. 

My dear young friends, 

On this momentous occasion, as you leave the portals of this institution, I wish each one of you a bright and fulfilling future, good health and happiness. I hope that you will strive to excel in your chosen profession and will bring great pride to your parents, to this university and this nation. 

I wish this University with tremendous potential for excellence in academics and research all the very best. I once again congratulate all the Graduates, Post-Graduates, Gold Medalists and others and wish them a very bright future. 

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today called for greater focus on poverty alleviation. He advised the governments to shun resorting to populist measuresand adopt a comprehensive approach towards poverty eradication.

The Vice President was responding to a question while interacting with the students of Akshara Vidyalaya, in Nellore today. A student had asked him why India still had poverty even after seventy years of independence.

Elaborating the reasons for poverty in India, Shri Naidu said that enough attention was not paid on poverty alleviation programs. Expressing his opposition to populist schemes, he said that a person should be taught how to catch fish rather than giving him the fish. 

Further he said that a section of people is still illiterate in India and this directly impacts their socio-economic upliftment. Therefore, education is the key to empower people reduce poverty.

He also highlighted that historically urban India got more facilities as compared to rural areas and this impacted the economic well-being of a large segment of rural population. 

Shri Naidu also blamed the population growth and gender discrimination for high level of inequality in Indian society. If one has less children, one can take better care of them, he opined.

Highlighting the importance of women education, he said that ‘when you educate a man, you educate a person but when you educate a woman, you educate whole family’. He appreciated the government for launching programs such as BetiBachao-BetiPadhao for overall well-being of the girl child.

Suggesting the right approach for poverty eradication, the Vice President said that focus should be on creating infrastructure and proper ecosystem such as – 24 hour supply of power and water, good marketing facilities for farmers to sell their produce, promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship among others.

Shri Naidu also highlighted the importance of keeping physically fit in life and said, “Physical fitness gives you mental fitness”. He advised the children to take part in sports, yoga and other outdoor activities.

Expressing concern over the rising number of Non -Communicable Diseases, the Vice President said that present day sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy food are main factors contributing to this. He advised the children to eat more of the traditional Indian food as that is more suited to our body and climatic conditions.

Stressing the need for protection and promotion of mother tongue, Shri Naidu asked students to speak in their mother tongue at home. “Learn as many languages as you can but always remember you your mother tongue”, he said.

Union HRD Minister, Shri Ramesh Phkhariyal ‘Nishank’ also interacted with the children and appreciated Akshara Vidyalaya for providing quality education for rural students and expressed happiness over the work done by the institution.

Later, the Vice President and Union HRD Minister together went around the various facilities of the Akshara Vidyalaya and Skill Development Center.

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today called for preservation and promotion of classical languages saying that they provide the window to our past and the civilizational values of ancient India. 

Shri Naidu, who arrived at Venkatachalam, in Nellore district by a special train, interacted with the Telugu scholars, litterateurs and experts in Telugu language during a luncheon meeting, in Nellore today.

During the interaction, the Vice President said that our classical languages represent the knowledge and wisdom of our ancient thinkers, scientists, poets, sages, doctors, philosophers and rulers.

“If we don’t preserve and sustain this link, we lose a very precious key to the treasure house we have all inherited’, he added.

Referring to reports, he expressed concern over the fact that more than 40 languages or dialects in India are considered to be endangered and are believed to be heading towards extinction as only a few thousand people speak them.

Shri Naidu’s discussions with scholars centered around the promotion of classical Telugu language and the development of the ‘Center of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu’ (CESCT).

The Center of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu (CESCT) was set up under the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysore after Telugu was recognized as a Classical Language in 2008. Telugu was declared as a classical languages as it fulfilled the following criteria set by the Government –

 


	High antiquity of its early texts/recorded history overperiod of 1500-2000 years;
	A body of ancient literature/texts, which is considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers;
	The literary tradition be original and not borrowed from another speech community;
	The classical language and literature being distinct from modern, there may also be a discontinuity between the classical language and its later forms or its offshoots.


It may recalled that Tamil was the first language in India to be accorded the classical language status in 2004. Subsequently, Centre for Excellence of Classical Tamil which was functioning in the campus of the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore was shifted to Chennai on request from Tamil Nadu government in 2008.The institute isnow known as the Central Institute of Classical Tamil (CICT).

The Vice President visited CICT, Chennai yesterday (on 19 January, 2020) to acquaint himself with the functioning and various projects undertaken by the institute for preservation and promotion of Tamil language. 

Sanskrit, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia are the other language that have been declared as classical languages in India by the government.

Following a demand to shift the Center of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu from Mysuru, the Vice President had suggested to shift the CESCT to then unified Andhra Pradesh, some years ago.

Subsequently the Central government wrote to the combined Andhra Pradesh government in this regard.

Following the bifurcation of the state of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Naidu again took the initiative and urged the Central government to shift CESCT to either of the Telugu speaking states.

Later the Union government decided to locate CESCT in Nellore. Even as the modalities are being worked out for a new campus for the institute in Nellore, Smt. Deepa Venkat, daughter of theVice President and Managing Trustee of Swarna Bharat Trust has offered to house the institute – for 3-4 years- free of cost in the premises of Swarna Bharat Trust, in Nellore.

On the suggestions of the Vice President, Union HRD Ministry has organised a two-day workshop on ‘Development of Center of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu’at Swarna Bharat Trust, Nellore. Various scholars and experts of Telugu classical language are participating in the workshop.

The Workshop among others things will discuss about the preparation of a roadmap on the preservation, propagation and promotion of classical Telugu so that the richness of the language could be taken to greater height.

The Center of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu, among others, propagates and preserves the classical language inside and outside of its speech territories. It undertakes and encourages research and documentation in India and abroad and also makes documentaries on scholars of eminence who are well versed in classical texts and explores linkages of classical language with classical music and dance forms.  The Center also translates classical texts into other Indian languages, English and selected European languages.

Later on the Vice President witnessed ‘BhuvanaVijayam’, a unique artistic rendering showcasing the best of Telugu classical poetry, at Swarna Bharat Trust.

The Vice President who is on a two -day tour to Nellore on January 20th and 21stwill attend a host of programs in the city.

This includes the Valadictory Session of the two-day workshop on Classical Telugu. The Union HRD Minister, Shri Ramesh Pokhariyal ‘Nishank’ will also grace the occasion.

On Tuesday (21 January, 2020), the Vice President accompanied by the Union HRD Minister, would visit Akshara Vidyalaya and Skill Development Center and in the afternoon,Shri Naidu will attend the Convocation of VikramaSimhapuri University at Sri Venkateshwara Kasturbha Kala Kshetram, Nellore.

Venkaiah Naidu has said that promotion and protection of ancient Indian languages is the need of the hour as they offer a window to our ancient civilisational values, knowledge and wisdom. He also called for a national movement for promotion of each and every mother tongue.

The Vice President made these remarks while visiting the Central Institute of Classical Tamil (CICT) and International Institute of Tamil Studies (IITS), in Chennai today.

Shri Naidu praised the efforts put by the Center in translation of Thirukkural into all Indian languages and also in some foreign languages. He further called for translation of ancient and popular Tamil texts into Indian and foreign languages for the wider benefit of humanity.

He appreciated the good work done by both institutes in documenting and preserving objects that are related to or reflect the antiquity of the Tamils.

“Your contributions are significant because there is no such institution anywhere in the world that is fully committed for carrying out researches on the ancient Tamil society”, he said to the staff and officials of the CICT and IITS.

The Vice President expressed the need to Harness the power of technology to preserve & promote the rich heritage of Indian languages. “We must have many more technological tools for communication in local languages to serve the needs of all our people speaking different languages”, Shri Naidu stressed.

VP called for according a sense of dignity & a sense of pride to those who speak, write and communicate in Indian languages. He also urged people to use their mother tongue at home, in the community, in meetings and in administration. 

Emphasizing that language preservation and development needed multi-pronged approach, Shri Naidu said it should begin at the primary school level and called for providing basic schooling in child’s mother tongue.

Saying that language was a vehicle of intergenerational transmission of culture, scientific knowledge and a worldview, the Vice President said that language evolves with human evolution and gets nourished by constant use.

The Vice President called for measures to encourage scholars to do research using the primary sources and unearth new nuggets of knowledge. ‘We must keep on adding to the knowledge and illuminate our present and future,’ he said.

Role of institutions such as Central Institute of Classical Tamil is very important in this. The institution and the researchers associated with the institution are doing a great service to the nation by preserving, protecting and promoting the beautiful language Tamil, he said.

The Central Institute of Classical Tamil (CICT) is an autonomous Institute of higher research functioning under the Ministry of Human Resources Development, Government of India. It has been focusing exclusively on the researches relating to the classical phase of the Tamil language, i.e., from the early period to the 600 A.D.  

The Vice President said that endeavours like these, will help in understanding the best of all cultures, societies and languages and brings people closer to one another.

During his visit to the International Institute of Tamil Studies, the Vice President went around the cultural centre with the permanent exhibition set up to recreate the history of Tamils unravelled by decades of research.

The exhibits are arranged in five galleries - the ""Tholkappiar Arangam"" displaying art forms, the ""Thiruvalluvar Arangam"" with exhibits of metalcraft/agriculture, education, medicine and weapons, the ""Kapilar Arangam"" with a collection of home tools/grinders and exhibits on temples and gods, the ""Avvaiyar Arangam"" with lifelike depictions of well-known events in the life of ancient kings and the ""Ilango Adigal gallery"" with exhibits on shipbuilding and sail-weaving.

The Vice President was very impressed by the full scale-models of the cities of Madurai and Srirangam highlighting the meticulous city-planning and temple-building artistry found in these cities.  

“I recommend a visit to this unique institution to better understand the history of Tamils. I am sure every visitor will come with a sense of satisfaction and fulfilment”, Shri Naidu said.

Shri D. Jayakumar, Minister for Fisheries, Tamil Nadu, Shri K. Pandiarajan, Minister for Tamil Official Language & Tamil Culture, Shri P. Benjamin, Minister for Rural Industries, Govt. of Tamil Nadu and officials of the Centers were among the dignitaries who accompanied the Vice President on the visit.

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today suggested the inclusion of the life stories of Veer Savarkar and other heroes of the freedom struggle from different parts of the country, in school textbooks.

Participating in a Civic Reception hosted in his honor by the Port Blair Municipal Council (PBMC), he said that the historical role of the Cellular Jail in Andaman in the freedom movement should also form part of History textbooks.

He also urged all Members of Parliament, MLAs and MLCs from across the country to visit Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Cellular Jail.

Recalling his visit to the Cellular Jail the previous day, Shri Naidu described it as a pilgrimage to a sacred temple.

Decrying the attempts to create divisive tendencies among the people, he said that unity is the need of the hour. Pointing out that our freedom was hard won, he urged all citizens to draw inspiration from the story of India's struggle for independence and from the countless sacrifices made by our freedom fighters and strive to reinforce the unity and integrity of this nation. 

Earlier in the day, the Vice President inaugurated the Nature Park and Interpretation Centre at Haddo in Port Blair. He released butterflies and went around the butterfly conservatory at the Park. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have around 300 species of butterflies out of which 207 are endemic to the region.  Water bodies with inter-connecting channels have been added in the conservatory to provide the much required moist and airy micro climate for the butterflies to thrive.

Shri Naidu also visited the orchid and fern house at the Nature Park and Interpretation Centre which showcases the habitat of the tropical orchids. So far about 140 species of orchids and an equal number of ferns have been reported from the Andaman Islands. They include tree-ferns whose origin can be traced back to the Jurassic era. Vanilla, used in confectionaries is also sourced from an orchid species found in these islands. 

At the Nature Park, the Vice President also appreciated a wooden sculpture of a mother and child, made out of the trunk of a single Andaman Padauk tree. The sculpture represents nature as a mother who lovingly nurtures all her creation. A tribal woman has been depicted as the mother, as a mark of deep respect to the tribal people of Andaman who are revered as the protectors of the Islands. 

He also flagged off AC buses and electric vehicles. The Vice President complimented the Andaman & Nicobar Administration for the initiative and said that it would provide sustainable mobility solutions and help in keeping the islands clean and green. He said the electric vehicles would bring down emissions considerably and curb pollution. 

Praising the administration for banning the use of single-use-plastics and for implementing the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in letter and spirit, Shri Naidu said that these initiatives including the increase in renewable energy capacity would promote sustainable development in the Islands.

Expressing his concern about the vulnerability of the islands to climate change, the Vice President said that India was playing a leadership role in promoting renewable energy, especially solar energy through initiatives like the International Solar Alliance.

Highlighting the role of connectivity in development, the Vice President expressed confidence that submarine Optical Fibre cable connectivity that is set to be operational by June 2020 would transform the development of the Islands. Four routes in the Islands have been included in UDAN for regional connectivity and International air travel is expected to be operational from Port Blair this year”, he added.

Launching the project for the replacement of traditional electricity meters with smart meters, Shri Naidu termed it as a pro-poor move.

The Vice President said that Smart meters will increase the ease of bill payment and eliminate the possibility of incorrect billing. He added that paperless billing with smart meters would also help the environment by saving the trees.

He visited a photo gallery and exhibition put up by the Port Blair Municipal Council on ‘Sanitation and Solid waste management’. The gallery showcased the best practices of the PBMC in the arena of sanitation and solid waste management, such as the use of 10 percent plastic in road construction and the restoration of traditional Japanese wells under the Jal Shakti Abhiyaan. The exhibition also displayed several pragmatic and aesthetic ‘waste to wealth’ products. 

Shri Naidu also laid the foundation stone for three projects under the Smart Cities Mission -- the Marine Esplanade, Neighborhood Parks and Fecal Sludge Treatment Plant. 

The Lieutenant Governor, Admiral DK Joshi, the Chief Secretary, Shri Chetan B. Sanghi and others were present on the occasion.

The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today urged the HRD Ministry and all State Governments to organize visits of students to the Cellular Jail in Port Blair and other historical places associated with the freedom struggle.

The Vice President visited the Cellular Jail, including the solitary confinement cell occupied by Veer Savarkar, and paid his tributes at the martyrs’ column, to the valiant freedom fighters, who were subjected to inhuman treatment during their incarceration at the time of freedom struggle.

Shri Naidu was accompanied by his spouse, Smt Ushamma, his son, son-in-law, daughter, and grand-children.

In a Facebook Post, the Vice President described his visit to the solitary confinement cell of Veer Savarkar as a “humbling experience”. He said that Veer Savarkar’s life is a great inspiration to youngsters.

He said that it (the Jail) was a stark reminder of the cruel and sadistic treatment meted to freedom fighters, who refused to abandon their love for the motherland. Fired by their patriotic passion and an iron resolve to free the country from an alien rule, the brave freedom fighters never gave up, he added.

Shri Naidu said that the Cellular jail was a reminder of how hard-won and precious our freedom is.

Stating that the Jail was now a place of pilgrimage for all those who love the country and value freedom, the Vice President described it as a symbol of resistance to the ills of colonialism.

While reminding the younger generation of the countless stories of sacrifices made by our courageous freedom fighters, he expressed confidence that a visit to the Cellular Jail would inspire them to strive for the greater glory of the country and to always protect the unity and integrity of this great nation.

Completed in the year 1906, Cellular Jail, also known as ‘kala pani’ or the ‘black waters’, derived its name from the small, individual cells that housed prisoners. Of the three-pronged tactic of hunger, torture and isolation, it was the isolation from fellow beings that acted as the harshest of punishments to inmates.

Shri Naidu said the purpose of solitary confinement was to demoralize freedom fighters. The jail, surrounded by hundreds of miles of ocean on all sides, provided little scope or hope for inmates to escape.

Apart from Veer Savarkar, many distinguished people were imprisoned in the Cellular Jail. They included Diwan Singh Kalepani, Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi, Yogendra Shukla, Batukeshwar Dutt, Maulana Ahmadullah, Movli Abdul Rahim Sadiqpuri, Ali Ahmed Siddiqui, Maulvi Liaquat Ali, Babarao Savarkar, Sachindra Nath Sanyal.

Veer Savarkar was sent to the Cellular Jail with a sentence of two life imprisonments. His life in solitary confinement was one of torture and suffering. He was yoked to the oil mill---the harshest manner of labor.

Savarkar was a source of inspiration for other prisoners. His brother was also in the same jail but both of them were unaware of each other’s presence.

The other imprisoned revolutionaries, on who cases were foisted by the British in connection with Alipore Bomb case, Nasik Conspiracy, Lahore Conspiracy Case and Chittagong Armory Raid Case, were given life sentences and had faced a lot of brutality and hardship.

Instead of calling them as conspiracy cases as referred by the British, we should describe them as ‘freedom struggle cases’, the Vice President said.

The Cellular Jail also houses the Eternal Flame and Martyrs’ Column as a tribute. Originally the jail was a massive three-storeyed structure with seven wings radiating from central fulcrum on which stood a watch tower. The jail could accommodate 690 inmates.   

The jail holds many horrific stories of the suffering of the heroes of our struggle for independence, who were unjustly incarcerated in this jail. But this pre-Independence penal institution is also a symbol of the brave resistance put up by our freedom fighters against the tyranny, oppression and injustice of the foreign rule, the Vice President added in the FB post.

Speaking at the 50th anniversary celebrations of Thuglak, a Tamil magazine, founded by the late Cho Ramaswamy,   Shri Naidu expressed his concern over the unhealthy trend of mixing news and views. He said that slanting stories and providing disproportionate coverage to certain issues in line with the management’s thinking has become the norm these days. 

The Vice President said that instead of giving complete information in an unadulterated manner, a section of the media was deciding what the viewer should watch or the reader should read. “Such a trend is not good for the fourth estate and Indian democracy in the longer run”, he cautioned.

Shri Naidu observed that journalism in the past was treated as a mission and many eminent journalists like the late Cho wielded the pen without any fear or favour. He said that they never succumbed to any kind of pressure or allurement, nor had they compromised on their integrity and values. They always remained wedded to the core principles of journalism and maintained high standards of accuracy and objectivity.

Describing Cho Ramaswamy as a multi-faceted genius, the Vice President said that he had left an indelible imprint on the world of journalism, cinema, drama, politics, law and literature.

The Vice President said that Thuglak’s rise tofame was due to Cho’s fiery and fearless journalism that put nation’s interest before anything else. Recalling the resistance put up by him during the Emergency, he said that Cho always believed in journalistic freedom and never missed an opportunity to oppose any move to curtail journalistic freedom. 

Shri Naidu observed that Cho’s style of journalism not only took everybody by surprise but also shook many because of his bold, courageous, sharp, satirical and witty writings and reviews.

Stating that Cho’s sharp wit, spontaneous humour and stage presence not only made him a successful drama artist but also a popular comedy actor, he said that his tryst with cinema transcended generations just as his Thuglak magazine did.  “His fans belonged to all ages, loving clean and spontaneous humour”, he added.

The Vice President appealed to the people to elect their representatives based on the four ‘C’- Character, Calibre, Capacity and Conduct of the candidates. This is very important to strengthen the democracy, he said.

A special edition of ‘Thuglak’ brought out to mark the 50th Anniversary was released by the Vice President and the first copy of this edition was presented to popular film actor, ShriRajnikanth.

The Editor in Chief of Thuglak, Shri S. Gurumurthy, popular actor, ShriRajinikanth, members of the family of late Shri Cho Ramaswamy and others were present on the occasion.

Following is the full text of the speech – 

“AnaivarukkumIniyaPongalVazhthukkal” 

Editor of ThuglakS.GurumurthyGaru and his entire team of Thuglak journalists and employees, beloved readers of Thuglak, members from the family of Cho Ramaswamy, Rajinikanthgaru, sisters and brothers, 

At the outset, I pay my reverential homage to late Cho Ramaswamy and compliment the entire team at Tughlak for carrying forward his legacy.

It is indeed a momentous occasion. The completion of 50 years is an important milestone for any organization and it assumes greater significance in the case of Tughlak as it has been the torchbearer of ethical journalism.

Such an achievement is not easy and it was made by possible only due to the strong foundation laid by the intellectual genius Cho. It was enriched by his dedicated team in Thuglak and strengthened by the thinking readers of Thuglak. 

I was happy to know that before my arrival a unique cross-examination session took place in which the readers posed a series of questions to the Editor, who answered them patiently. Such an initiative is truly laudable as it strengthens bonds between Tughlak and its readers.

I am told that organizing such a session has become a tradition at Thuglak and is being held every year on January 14. This is a unique hallmark of Thuglak.

Cho Ramaswamy was a multi-faceted genius, who left an indelibleimprint on the world of journalism, cinema, drama, politics, law, literature and without question in the field of Sanathana Dharma. His belief in the civilizational assets of Bharat and the religious tenets of Hinduism has always guided his vision. As we celebrate the completion of 50 years of Thuglak, it should be remembered that the magazine became synonymous with Cho Ramaswamy.

Thuglak’s rise to fame was due to Cho’s fiery and fearless journalism that put nation’s interest before anything else. The resistance put up by him during the Emergency and the creative way in which he blackened the front page and carried a review of the old movie ‘Sarvadhikari’ (Dictator) will always remain etched in our memories.

Cho always believed in journalistic freedom and never missed an opportunity to oppose any move to curtail journalistic freedom. 

On a personal note, I recall the friendly conversations I used to have with Shri Cho Ramaswamy when both of us were members of the RajyaSabha. I had always marvelled at the ease with which he used to inject humour into every discussion. 

As a literary expert, Cho’s works on SrimadRamayanam, Mahabharatham, facets of Hinduism and other similar works, are eternal symbols of his unshakeable belief in Hindu philosophy, the Vedas, Itihasas and other traditions. His other works include famous novels like Muhammad Bin Thuglak which was later made into a drama and movie, Unmaye Un VilaiEnna, tele-serial EngeBrahmanan, etc. all of them espousing a cause, belief or way of life. His novels were known for their humour and satire.

He was deeply influenced by MahakaviSubramaniyaBharati. I am told that during the Emergency the literary section of Thuglak quoted Bharathiyar’sPanchaliSabhatham, in which Arjuna consoled Bhima saying “Kattundom, Poruthiruppom, KalamMaarum” (We are bound now, but we will wait! For the times to change!!)

Cho’s masterly direction and narration in theatre, I am told, has given his scripts an immortal life. Dramas like EndruThaniyumIndhaSudhandhiraDhagam, Muhammad Bin Thuglak, stay relevant in contemporary politics. I am told that his dramas were the most sought after during his times and the audience used to thoroughly enjoy them.

Cho’s sharp wit, spontaneous humour and stage presence not only made him a successful drama artist but also a popular comedy actor. His tryst with cinema transcended generations just as his Thuglak magazine did. His fans belonged to all ages, loving clean and spontaneous humour.

Cho’s contribution to journalism through Thuglak is the jewel in the crowning glory of Cho’s public life. Cho’s style of journalism not only took everybody by surprise but also shook many because of his bold, courageous, sharp, satirical and witty writings and reviews. The Thuglakmagazine started in 1970 was inspired by his satirical political drama ‘Muhammad bin Thuglak’ and hence the name Thuglak. 

I have seen Cho’s brand of journalism from close quarters. At a time when media had to depend on advertisement revenues, Cho ensured that Thuglak survived on readers’ subscription revenue. I understand that even today, every issue of Thuglak carries 48 pages only. Not more or not less. Indeed, the readers of Tughlak deserve applause. 

Cho’s satire and journalistic standards brought him closer to many political personalities. Despite having friendship with leaders and public intellectuals from varied background, Cho remained an intellectual centrist and spared nobody whenever due. 

Thuglak is celebrating its 50th Anniversary, an important milestone that any organisation shall always cherish. Continuing his legacy in the field of journalism is the best tribute one could pay to him.

I wish Thuglak endured success and I am confident that the entire team of Thuglak under the editorial leadership of Gurumurthygaru shall continue to hold the beacon of journalistic ethics.

Dear sisters and brothers, the press had played a pioneering role in India’s freedom struggle and in strengthening the foundations of democracy in post-Independent India. Over the past many years, the media landscape has transformed profoundly with the advent of electronic media and the social media more recently.

In the past, journalism was treated as a mission and many eminent journalists like the late Cho used to wield the pen without any fear or favour. They never succumbed to any kind of pressure or allurement, nor had they compromised on their integrity and values. They always remained wedded to the core principles of journalism and maintained high standards of accuracy and objectivity.

What we see today is a far cry from all that. The media is no longer neutral. These days, one can hardly get an objective picture of the current happenings or any development by reading one newspaper or watching a single news channel. 

The unhealthy trend of mixing news and views, slanting stories and providing disproportionate coverage to certain issues in line with the management’s thinking has become the norm these days. Instead of giving complete information in an unadulterated manner, a section of the media is deciding what the viewer should watch or the reader should read. Such a trend is not good for the fourth estate and Indian democracy in the longer run.

I feel the time has come for the entire media fraternity to do a serious introspection and curb any unhealthy trend that affects its credibility. 

I understand that Cho’s commentary on SubramaniaBharati’s Bhagavad Gita is played every year before the Thuglak Anniversary meet. Bharati was an embodiment of both Bhakti and Nationalism and it is no surprise that Cho drew inspiration from the great poet from Ettayapuram.

I would like to conclude with a quote from SubramaniaBharati’s “Enn Thai” stressing on the united spirit of Bharat Mata:

“MuppathuKodiMugamudayalUyir, MoimpuraOnrudayalIval

SeppuMozhiPadhinettuUdayal, Enir, SindhanaiOnrudayal”

This is a beautiful poem that brings out the essential unity in diversity which has been the foundational spirit of our great country Bharat.

Thank you and Jai Hind!

                Eminent Agricultural Scientist Dr M S Swaminathan was presented the ‘MuppavarapuVenkaiah Naidu National Award for Excellence’ for his distinguished contribution to the field of agriculture today.

The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu presented him the award during the Pongal Celebrations held at Raj Bhavan in Chennai today.

The Award instituted by the Muppavarapu Foundation was announced recently during its 10th anniversary celebrations in Hyderabad. It carries a cash prize of Rs. 5 lakhs and a citation. 

Addressing the gathering, the Vice President describedShriSwaminathan as the “Father of the Green Revolution in India and the Doyen of Agricultural Science”. He has been playing a pioneering role in the advancement of agriculture and improving the lives of the farmers, the Vice President added.

Pointing out that the TIME magazine had described him as one of the 20 most influential Asians of the 20th century and one of the only three from India, Shri Naidu appealed to young agricultural scientists to emulate his qualities and work with dedication for the uplift of farmers and to make agriculture profitable, sustainable and viable.

Conveying his heartiest Pongal wishes to the people, the Vice President said that Pongalwas the celebration of the bounty of nature. “It is the expression of profound gratitude to nature for nourishing and sustaining life”, he added.

Referring to the concerns over the degradation of environment and reckless exploitation of natural resources, he said that traditional wisdom and practices of nature conservation must become a source of inspiration and serve as a roadmap for inclusive and sustainable development.

The Vice President asked young agri-researchers to come up with out of box ideas to make agriculture profitable, sustainable and viable.

After the award ceremony, the Vice President, his spouse Smt. Ushamma and family members witnessed a cultural program along with other dignitaries on the occasion of Pongal.

Terming India as “the land of festivals”, the Vice President said that because of the cultural foundations in the country, the spirit of festivity often crosses lines of region, religion and community.

Stating that Indian festivals have acted as a strong unifying force, binding the county together through shared joy, love and brotherhood, Shri Naidu stressed the importance of taking our unique festivals to younger generations so that they were made aware of the legacy of the grand civilization they inherited.

He expressed the confidence that our festivals would reinforce the unique identity of our civilization and inspire us to build a prosperous, peaceful, unified, inclusive and beautiful world.

The Governor of Tamil Nadu, ShriBanwarilalPurohit, Governor of Telangana, Dr.TamilisaiSoundararajan, Speaker, Tamil Nadu Assembly, Dr P. Dhanpal and Ministers of Tamil Nadu Government, Shri D. Jayakumar, ShriPandiarajan and Shri P. Benjamin were among the dignitaries who graced the occasion. 

Following is the full text of the speech –

“I am delighted to be here in Chennai Raj Bhawan with all of you to celebrate Pongal.

At the outset, let me convey my heartiest Pongal wishes to each and every one of you!

Let me thank the Hon’ble Governor of Tamil Nadu, ShriBanwarilalPurohit for his kind invitation to join this celebration.

Pongal is one of the most popular and most fervently celebrated harvest festivals of South India.

The literal meaning of Pongal is ""spilling over"".

It points to the tradition of boiling rice in a pot until it starts overflowing, symbolizing a bountiful harvest, prosperity and wellbeing.

Pongal falls in mid-January every year and marks the auspicious beginning of Uttarayan –the northward migration of the Sun which would last for six months.

Even though Pongal was originally a festival for the farming community, today it is celebrated by all.

Pongal is the celebration of the bounty of nature. It is the expression of profound gratitude to nature for nourishing and sustaining life.

A special puja is performed on the first day of Pongal before the cutting of the paddy. Farmers worship the sun and the earth by dutifully anointing their ploughs and sickles with sandal wood paste. It is with these consecrated tools that the newly-harvested rice is cut.

Other traditions of the celebration include drawing of Kolam and cooking of delicious Pongal.

Each of the three days of Pongal is marked by different festivities.

The first day, BhogiPongal, is a day to celebrate family life and relationships. Surya Pongal, the second day, is dedicated to the worship of Surya, the Sun God by offering milk and jaggery to the deity. The third day of Pongal, Pongal, is for worship of the cattle or Mattu. The Pongal that has been offered to the Gods is fed to cattle and birds.

During the festival, people pay their tributes and respects to the departed elders in the family by cooking their favourite dishes. It is the time to remember and pay tributes to them. New clothes are offered to the needy and community lunches are also organized.

This festival beautifully captures the essence of the deep respect and reverence for nature that forms the foundation of the Indian civilization. We consider earth to be our mother and are proud of our long tradition of harmonious existence between man and nature.

This reverence for nature has been abundantly reflected in our traditional practices, religious beliefs, rituals, folklore, art and crafts and in our daily lives.

Today, when the global community is extremely worried by the degradation of the environment and the disastrous consequences of the reckless exploitation of natural resources, traditional wisdom and practices of nature conservation must become a source of inspiration and serve as a roadmap to inclusive and sustainable development.

My dear sisters and brothers,

India is known as the land of festivals.

Every month of the calendar holds one festival or the other, celebrated by different communities.

But what is unique about India is that, because of its strong cultural foundations, the spirit of festivity often crosses lines of region, religion and community.

Our festivals have acted as a strong unifying force, binding the county together through shared joy, love and brotherhood.

This will also help in taking our unique festivals to younger generations, to our children, so that they are made aware of the legacy of the grand civilization which they have inherited.

Dear sisters and brothers

I deem it an honour to present the 'MuppavarapuVenkaiah Naidu National Award' instituted by Muppavarapu Foundation to ShriSwaminathanGaru, the Father of the Green Revolution in India and the Doyen of Agricultural Science. He has been playing a pioneering role in the advancement of agriculture and improving the lives of the farmers.

ShriSwaminathan has been acclaimed by the TIME magazine as one of the 20 most influential Asians of the 20th century and one of the only three from India, the other two being the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi and Viswakavi, Rabindranath Tagore. He has been described by the United Nations Environment Programme as ""the Father of Economic Ecology"" because of his leadership of the ever-green revolution movement in agriculture.

On this occasion, I appeal to young agricultural scientists to emulate the qualities of ShriSwaminathan and work with dedication for the uplift of farmers and to make agriculture profitable, sustainable and viable.

I am hopeful that in the time to come we will celebrate many more festivals together, as a nation.

I am confident that our festivals will reinforce the unique identity of our civilization, inspiring us to build a prosperous, peaceful, unified, inclusive and beautiful world.

Once again, let me wish each and every one of you a very happy Pongal!

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has greeted the nation on the auspicious occasion of Makar Sankranti and Pongal.

In a message, VP paid tribute to the farmers for their relentless toil and said, “let us all resolve to return to our roots and protect our glorious culture, traditions, customs, arts and festivals.”

Following is the full text of the message -

“I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all our citizens on the auspicious occasion of Makar Sankranti and Pongal. 

The harvest festival signifies the beginning of Uttarayan and is dedicated to Sun God who is regarded as the symbol divinity and wisdom.

Throughout India, people celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm. It is celebrated in different names in different parts of the country. In south India, it is popularly called as “Pongal & ‘Makar Sankranti’, ‘Vishu’ in Kerala, in Punjab and Haryana it is called ‘Lohri’, in Assam, it is called ‘Bihu’ and ‘Khichdi festival’ in Bihar.

This festival called by different names marks the beginning of a new season with thousands of people taking holy dips in sacred rivers. It basically celebrates the bounty of nature and is symbolized by the expression of profound gratitude to nature for nourishing and sustaining life.

Pongal festival is associated with agriculture and harvesting of the crops. It is marked by worshipping the Sun God and decorating the bullocks, ploughs and sickles. A special puja is performed on the first day and farmers cut the newly harvested paddy with the consecrated tools.

Festivals are an inherent part of our great civilization and have a strong association with nature.  They promote the message of togetherness, love, and brotherhood and are the occasions for families and their dear and near ones to come together and celebrate them.

On this auspicious occasion, let us pay tribute to our farmers for their relentless toil and let us all resolve to return to our roots and protect our glorious culture, traditions, customs, arts and festivals. May this festival usher in greater prosperity, peace and happiness in the country!”

                The Vice President of India Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called upon the youth work towards shaping an India that is free of hunger, discrimination and inequalities based on caste, creed and gender. 

Speaking at the Centenary Celebrations of ‘Sri Ramakrishna Vijayam,’ Tamil Monthly Magazine brought out by Ramakrishna Mission in Chennai today, he said that there was a renewed interest on India world over as the country was moving to become a 5 trillion dollar economy. 

At this juncture, Shri Naidu said that the timeless vision and teachings of Swami Vivakananda would continue to be the guideposts for the individual growth and collective advancement of the nation. 

Shri Naidu described Swami Vivekananda as an embodiment of Hindu culture and a social reformer, who was against religious dogmas. He said that Vivekananda believed in the uplift of humanity, irrespective of caste or creed. 

Calling upon the youth to take inspiration from the life and teachings of Swami Vivekanada, he urged them to dedicate their lives for the progress of country, welfare of the downtrodden and uplift of the poor. “We have opportunities to become strong, stable and more prosperous nation,” he added.

Shri Naidu said that Swami Vivekananda was anguished by the miserable living conditions of the poor and recalled that he prioritized “first bread and then religion.” 

Vivekananda also felt that no amount of politics would be of any avail until the masses in India were well educated, well fed, and well cared for. 

Talking about the importance of holistic education that takes care of the physical and mental wellbeing of the children, the Vice President said “For Swami Ji education did not mean academic pursuits alone. He stressed equally on physical fitness and bodily health.”

While expressing his deep concern over the spurt in Non Communicable Diseases, the Vice President cautioned the youth be aware of the ill effects of the changing life style and dietary habits. He suggested them to practice yoga, meditation and adopt healthy eating habits.  

He also asked the youth to take a pledge to be physically fit and promote India’s cultural and spiritual values. 

The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Sri Banwarilal Purohit, Minister for Fisheries, Govt of Tamil Nadu, Thiru Jaya Kumar, Pujya Swami Gautamanandaji, Vice President, SRK Math & Mission, Belur and others were present at the event. 

Later, the Vice President visited Amir Mahal, the residence of Prince of Arcot, Nawab Mohammad Abdul Ali and interacted with his family members and other guests at a reception hosted in honour of the Vice President.

Briefly addressing the gathering, Shri Naidu said that India was known for its civilizational values the world over. He urged the people, particularly the younger generation to promote and propagate India’s culture and heritage. 

The Vice President said “we speak different languages but we all are one. The constitution provides equal opportunities to all citizens.

Following is the full text of the Vice President’s speech on centenary celebrations of Ramakrishna Vijayam-

“Dear Sisters and Brothers,

Today is a great day. It was on this day in 1863 that one of the most illustrious spiritual leaders of India and an embodiment of Hindu Culture, Swami Vivekananda was born.

I join the nation in paying homage to Swami Vivekananda, an embodiment of Hindu Culture on his birth anniversary today. An ardent advocate of universal brotherhood, peace and a strong proponent of India's ancient wisdom and values, Swamiji's teachings resonate with us all the times.

Through his address at Chicago's World Parliament of Religions, Swami Vivekananda introduced the timeless values of our culture and its eternal relevance for maintaining peace. 

A great saint, teacher and social reformer, Swami Vivekananda played a major role in introducing Hinduism to the West.

I bow my head to this great son of mother India.

Today, India is moving on an ambitious path to transform people’s lives. We are on track to become a 5 trillion dollar economy. There is renewed interest in India world over.

At this juncture, the timeless vision and teachings of Swami Vivakananda will continue to be the guideposts for our individual growth and collective advancement.

Swami Ji was a social reformer and was against religious dogmas. He believed in the uplift of humanity, irrespective of caste or creed and emphasized the importance of spiritualism for the survival and progress of mankind.

The Swami Ji had said “I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true”.

In his historic Chicago address to the Parliament of Religions, he had said: I am proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth. I am proud to tell you that we have gathered in our bosom the purest remnant of the Israelites, who came to Southern India and took refuge with us in the very year in which their holy temple was shattered to pieces by Roman tyranny. I am proud to belong to the religion which has sheltered and is still fostering the remnant of the grand Zoroastrian nation”.

Each religion can enrich itself with the higher values professed by the other, and realise that all paths, ‘crooked or straight’ lead to the Supreme Source. Truth is the essence of divinity, inherent in every religion.

Swami Ji in his final speech on September 27 had advocated that a Christian was not to become a Hindu, or a Buddhist to become a Christian. ‘But each must assimilate the others, and grow according to its own laws of growth.

Today more than ever, there is a need to bring down walls that create differences among people. We follow Sarva Dharma Sama Bhavana — that is in our Indian blood and part of our civilization.

We should all understand the concepts, precepts and practices connected with Hinduism in a correct perspective.

But, what exactly is ‘Hinduism’?  That is the question.  That has to be understood. That has to be analyzed. That has to be articulated in a proper manner. As Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had observed, “We find it difficult, if not impossible, to define Hindu religion or even adequately describe it. Unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any Prophet.  It does not worship any one God.” In fact, there is a whole range of beliefs from atheism to worshipping Gods and Goddesses in different forms. In fact, we believe divinity exists in each and every being or in every atom of the Universe.

As Radhakrishnan goes on to say, “It does not subscribe to one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophical concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances.  In fact, it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any religion or creed.  It may broadly be described as a way of life, and nothing more.”  This is what Dr. Radhakrishnan has said. Hinduism is a way of life. It is a way of life that has evolved over millions of years and has become an integral part of our daily lives. When someone asked me for a simple definition of this way of life , I had said that if you eat what you have, it is quite natural, if  you snatch away what others are eating it is unnatural, but If you share what you have with others in need , that reflects your cultural refinement. I wish to underscore this attitude of ‘care’ and ‘share’ as the core principle of Indian way of life.

Dear sisters and brothers

Swami Vivekananda believed in the religion of humanity. Swami ji said that he did not believe in a god or religion ‘ which cannot wipe the widow’s tears or bring a piece of bread to the orphan’s mouth’.

His heart pained at the miserable living conditions of his fellow countrymen. He prioritized “first bread and then religion” and felt that no amount of politics would be of any avail until the masses in India are well educated, well fed, and well cared for.

Swami Ji had said: “Let each one of us pray day and night for the downtrodden millions who are held fast by poverty, priest-craft and tyranny. Pray day and night for them. I care more to preach religion to them than to the high and the rich”.

Stressing on the emancipating role of education, he advocated inclusive education system and said, “If the poor boy cannot come to education, education must go to him”.

For Swami Ji education did not mean academic pursuits alone, he stressed equally on physical fitness and bodily health. Very few of us know that Swami Vivekanada was a good player of football as well.

Swami Ji observed that the greatest sin is to consider oneself to be weak. ‘You will understand the Bhagwad Gita better with your biceps, your muscles, a little stronger,’

Today Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given a call for ‘Fit India’. I appeal to each and every youngster to adopt it as a mission and spread the message of fitness among our schools, institutions, friends, families and communities.

Let us take this pledge on the Birth Anniversary of Swami Vivekanada today.

His clarion call to youth was - “Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.”

Our youth must become ambassadors of our great heritage and culture. India was known as Vishwaguru once upon a time and was in the forefront of knowledge creation and sharing it with people from all over the world. We believe in sharing our knowledge for the well-being of entire humanity as we treat the entire universe as one family-Vasudhaika Kutumbakam. Share and care is at the core of Indian philosophy.

Youth are the future of any nation and they must work towards shaping India that is free of hunger, discrimination and inequalities based on caste, creed and gender.

Of course, there would be challenges in it. But let me quote Swami Ji who had said: “In a day, when you don’t come across any problems - you can be sure that you are travelling in a wrong path.”

Swami Ji always advocated women’s empowerment and gender equality. He had stated, “The best thermometer to the progress of a nation is treatment of its women”.

He had also said “there is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved.

In the 21st century, the world is facing the threats of fragmentation, conflict, hatred and irrational prejudices. The voice of Swami Vivekanada is an eternal guiding lamp for the humanity. We need to strive to spread Swami Ji’s teachings far and wide.

In this regard, I am happy to note that Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai has been publishing ’Sri Ramakrishna Vijayam” a Tamil monthly since January 1921.

It is a record that a spiritual-cultural Tamil monthly maintained uninterrupted publication and is celebrating Centenary Year.

I am told that 3 other magazines, viz., Prabuddha Bharata (English), Udbodhan (Bengali) and Vedanta Kesari (English) have crossed centenary year landmark. It is praiseworthy that all the three magazines are from Sri Ramakrishna Mission.

Sri Ramakrishna Vijayam has been propagating Sanatana Dharma since its inception.

Once again, I congratulate Sri Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Vijayam for doing yeoman service to humanity.

Swami Ji had said, “They alone live, who live for others.”

Today on National Youth Day, I call upon the youth of the country to take inspiration from the life and teachings of Swami Vevekanada and dedicate their lives for the progress of country, welfare of the downtrodden and uplift of the poor.

As we celebrate National Youth Day, we must make the youth understand the importance of the teachings of Vivekananda. The youth must follow the path laid down by Swami Vivekananda and lead by the ideals of Tyaga (Sacrifice) and Seva (Service).

My best wishes to all of you.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said today that music was at the core of India’s cultural heritage and it not only provides solace but also unites and connects people.

Inaugurating 173rd Aradhana Festival of Sri Thyagaraja at Thiruvaiyaru in Thanjavur district today, he observed thatart unites hearts and added that music, painting and art were important facets of our civilization.

Calling for preservation and protection of our unique cultural heritage, he said “Our culture and values are our identity. It is what makes us unique. It is what has earned us the respect of the whole world”.

Paying rich tributes to Saint Composer, Thyagaraja, he described himas one of the greatest music maestros of India. “Sadguru Thaygaraja is one among the most revered 18th Century Trinity of composers–the others being Shyama Sastry and Sri Muthuswami Dikshithar”, he added.

The Vice President said that Saint Thyagaraja’s contributions to the enrichment of our cultural heritage cannot be quantified or estimated. He not only embodied ethical and philosophical truths in his songs but also put them into practice in his daily life. His style was simple, beautiful, and charming, which appealed to the learned and laymen alike, Shri Naidu stressed.

Praising Saint Thyagaraja as the composer of countless immortal kritis in various ragas, Shri Naidu said that Sri Thyagaraja’s compositions were treasures for the world of Music and would live in our hearts forever. “His heart poured out his Bhakti for Lord Rama and his songs are full of bhava/emotion that melts your heart”, he observed.

Lauding the tradition of conducting the festival of Thyagaraja Aradhana every year, he said that there was a growing interest and participation in the annual event to pay tributes to Saint Thyagaraja .

He also called upon the schools and educational institutions to sensitize children to the diverse elements of our rich culture. From reading the Jataka tales to experiencing the architectural marvels of ancient India, they must be encouraged to explore the various fascinating facets of our culture and learn life lessons from them, VP said.

Stressing the need to take the treasures of our culture to future generations, the Vice President said that they must know of the stalwarts like Saint Tyagaraja and must be proud of their glorious cultural inheritance. They must not forget their roots and must draw inspiration from its brilliance, he added.

The Vice President complimented the Thyagabrahma Mahotsava Sabha Shri Moopanar’s family for maintaining the tradition of conducting Annual Aradhana Festivals every successive year.

Thiru Vellamandi N.Natarajan, The Minister for Tourism, Govt of Tamil Nadu, Shri G.K. Vasan, President of the Thyagabrahma Mahotsava Sabha, Shri A.K. Palanivel, Secretary of the Sabha and Shri V. Raja Rao, Secretary of the Sabha, were among those who graced the occasion.

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am very happy to be here at the 173rd Aradhana Festival of Sri Thyagaraja at Thiruvaiyaru, a holy place on the banks of river Cauvery. It is heartening to note that this tradition has been maintained for 173 years and that year after year, there is growing interest and participation in this Aradhana festival that pays tributes to Saint Thyagaraja.

As we pay tributes to one of the greatest music maestros of India, we celebrate his life, his compositions and, his unparalleled legacy. 

Saint Thyagaraja was, beyond any doubt, a stalwart, one of the tallest figures in the world of music. 

The contributions of Saint Thyagaraja to the enrichment of our cultural heritage cannot be quantified or estimated. 

It is infinite in its resonance. 

His compositions which have been cherished over centuries will continue to be treasured by the young and the old for all time to come.

I compliment the Thyagabrahma Mahotsava Sabha for maintaining the tradition of conducting Annual Aradhana Festivals. 

I am confident this Aradhana Festival will inform and remind all who participate, of a golden which marked a high point in the history of classical music in India.

My dear sisters and brothers, 

In the turbulent times that we live in, it is comforting and invigorating to pause and reflect on our unique cultural heritage. 

India is one of the most ancient civilizations of the world and is home to astounding cultural diversity. Indian culture, often described as an amalgamation of several cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old.

Many elements of India’s diverse culture, such as relegions, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music, yoga and movies, have a profound impact world over. 

There is no doubt that ‘art unites hearts’. Music is among those elements of our culture that have great potential to unite people, to help us connect and understand each other. 

From the first lullaby that is lovingly sung by mother to her child, music penetrates almost every part of our life, our work, our relationships and even the way we worship the almighty. 

Music, in its pure form, is spiritual nourishment for our souls. 

It is at the core of our cultural and age old heritage. 

Our classical music, which has its origin in the Vedas, is said to be a gift of God himself; it is ‘Nadabrahma’, the sound of God, the music that pervades the universe. 

Saint Thyagaraja is the composer of countless immortal kritis in various ragas. Most of his compositions are in Telugu, a sweet language which has been described as a suitable language for music by Mahakavi Subrahmanya Bharati. 

Born in Thiruvarur in 1767 to Sri Ramabrahmam and Sitammal, Sri Thyagaraja settled down in the holy town of Thiruvaiyaru, where he learned music under the tutelage of Shri Sonti Vennkataramana Sastri.

A composer of kritis in rare ragas, Saint Thyagaraja, a Rama Bhakta, made his devotion to Lord Rama the theme for almost all of his kritis. As his heart poured out his Bhakthi for Lord Rama the songs are full of bhava/emotion that melts your heart. The conversation between a bhaktha and the God are profound messages to mankind .

Many of his compositions in Telugu are rendered as centre pieces in the concert by artistes young and old and  convey  the beauty of the raga as well as the emotional content so well making the listeners go into raptures . In singing his compositions such as మోక్షము గలదా (Mokshamu Galada) or వందనము రఘునందనా (Vandanamu Raghunandana) the bhava rules supreme!

Ramabhakthi and nadopasana were the two cardinal features of his compositions. He realized that music, in all its aspects, formed part of nadayoga. 

In his songs, he reveals the supremacy of nadayoga as a means of realisation of God.

Another important contribution of Saint Thyagaraja to music lies in his improvisation of sangathis in kirthanas. His style was simple, beautiful, and charming, which appealed to the learned and laymen alike. 

It is the richness of the raga bhava of his compositions that gives him a place amongst the greatest composers of music. 

Saint Thyagarajanot only embodied ethical and philosophical truths in his songs but also put them in practice in his daily life.

He rejected riches and opted for austerity. The pious soul felt that a poor and honest life spent in ‘nadopasana’ was preferable to chasing earthly pleasures and riches. 

This philosophy of life has been revealed in his famous song, (నిధి చాలా సుఖమా?)“Nidhi chalaa sukhama?”

His followers believed that he was a re-incarnation of Sage Valmiki. 

When he attained the lotus feet of Sri Rama on Pushya Bahula Panchami Day in 1847, his mortal remains were interred on the left bank of River Cauvery with the honour and religious rites due to a Sanyasi. 

Sadguru Thaygaraja is one among the most revered  18 th Century Trinity of composers –the others being Shyama Sastry and Sri Muthuswami Dikshithar.The majestic Pancharathna Krithis – the five gems in five ragas are sung with utmost devotion by all musicians coming together from various parts of India and the World  in the Annual Aradhana .A Brindavan was erected over that spot and his disciples started performing the Aradhana every year on Bahula Panchami day at the Samadhi.

All the disciples of Saint Thyagaraja were deeply devoted to him, but the contributions of Bangalore Nagaratnam Ammal are worth mentioning. 

She was an ardent devotee of Saint Thyagaraja. I am happy to know that befitting the memory of Nagaratnam Ammal, it is in front of her mandapam that musicians now perform during the Aradhana.

Thyagaraja’s compositions are truly treasures for the world of Music  and will live in our hearts forever.After all these years, if we congregate at this holy place even today to pay our humble respects to Saint Thyagaraja every successive year, it is because of the yeomen services rendered by Shri Moopanar’s family and the past and present Office-bearers of the Sabha to the memory of Sri Thyagaraja and to the Thyagabrahma Mahotsava Sabha. 

I am happy to know that Shri G.K. Moopanar was associated with the Sabha as its President from 1966 for 36 years and that it was during his days of Presidentship that the Sabha rose to great heights and the Aradhana became an international festival. 

After his demise, the legacy was carried on by his brother Shri G.Rangasamy Moopanar who has been spearheading the development of the Sabha and its activities for 18 long years successfully. 

Now, the mantle of Presidentship of the Sabha has passed on to Shri G.K. Vasan. Having observed the performance of Shri Vasan, in public life, in Parliament, and in Government, and also going by his meticulous planning to make this Aradhana festival a grand success, I am sure the Sabha is in very safe hands. 

I am confident that he will take the Aradhana festival to greater heights in the time to come.

My dear sisters and brothers, 

Our culture and values are our identity. It is what makes us unique. It is what has earned us the respect of the whole world. 

The philosophy of our civilization has always been that of ‘vasudhaiva kutumbakam’. We have always embraced the whole world as our own. ‘Sarve Jana Sukhino Bhavanthu’ has always been our prayer. 

We must protect this ancient culture and the immortal, humanitarian values that are our legacy. 

The most effective way to ensure this is to take the treasures of our culture to future generations. They must know of the stalwarts like Saint Tyagaraja and must be proud of their glorious cultural inheritance. They must draw inspiration from its brilliance and unite to chart a path forward for the nation. 

Our schools and educational institutions must strive to sensitize children to the diverse elements of our culture. From reading the Jataka tales to experiencing the architectural marvels of ancient India, they must be encouraged to explore the various fascinating facets of our culture and learn life lessons from them. 

Our future generations must never forget their roots. But they also must not be confined by it. 

Mahatma Gandhi once said that “Nothing can be farther from my thought than that we should become exclusive or erect barriers. But I do respectfully contend that an appreciation of other cultures can fitly follow, never precede, an appreciation and assimilation of our own”. 

I hereby declare the 173rd Thyagaraja Aradhana Festival open. 

I am hopeful that it will succeed in taking the treasures of India classical music to future generations.

Vanakkam.

Thank You!Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today asserted that there was a need to Indianize the education system without distorting any historical facts.
Speaking at the 21st Graduation Day Ceremony of Srimad Andavan Arts and Science College, Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu, Shri Naidu said that respecting elders, Guru, nature and all faiths was part of the Indian culture.   He said that Indian family system was the strongest USP as it molds children and youngsters into tolerant and socially conscious individuals.

He said that the education system should reflect India’s cultural values, history, and heritage.

The inspiring stories of valour and sacrifices of legendary freedom fighters like Veerapandian Kattabomman, Tiruppur Kumaran, Basaveshawara and Alluri Seetharamaraju should be included in the text books.

Urging the students to face the 21st century challenges effectively by upgrading their skills and enhancing their knowledge, he said it was time to reorient the education system to prepare students to be globally competitive.

Referring to schemes like Skill India, Make in India, Digital India and Startup India, the Vice President said that these programs offered immense opportunities for youngsters to showcase their talent and entrepreneurial skills.

“As the country marches ahead in the quest to become a 5 trillion dollar economy, our energetic, innovative and entrepreneurial youth will have a major role to play in achieving that goal,” he added.

The Vice President urged the private sector to join hands with the government in strengthening education, healthcare and other sectors in the rural areas to end the urban-rural divide.

Stressing the need to impart the spirit of voluntarism and service among students from childhood, Shri Naidu said that every student should become socially responsible and participate in community services in tune with India’s age old philosophy of share and care.

He suggested encouraging students to take part in activities such as NSS and NCC as it would promote team spirit and camaraderie
Expressing concern over the rising incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) due to changing lifestyles and dietary habits, Shri Naidu advised the youngsters to avoid junk food. He also wanted them to stay healthy by participating in regular physical activities.    

Earlier, on his way to Srimad Andavan College, the Vice President got down from his car, to watch the majestic Cauvery.  He called for collective efforts to protect and rejuvenate all rivers as they are the lifeline of human civilization.

The Minister for Tourism, Govt of Tamil Nadu, Thiru. Vellamandi Natarajan, the Chairman, National Executive Committee, Andavan Ashram, Shri R.Rajagopal, the Secretary and Correspondent, Shri CA. Ammangi V. Balaji, Chairman SRPVT, Shri N. Gopalaswami, Board of Trustees, Director, Principal, Staff and Students of Srimad Andavan Arts and Science College were present.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called for collective efforts by all stakeholders to make India 100 percent literate in the near future.

Inaugurating the Centenary celebrations of National College at Tiruchirappalli, in Tamil Nadu today, the Vice President expressed disappointment over the fact that India still has 18-20% illiterate population, even after 70 years of independence.

Observing that literacy was a step towards empowerment, he called for stepping up the pace of literacy campaigns, especially those that have an impact on adult literacy.

Expressing his concern that none of the premier Indian Universities figured in the top 300 global list of institutions, the Vice President said that though India was home to premier institutions like IISc, IIT, IIM, only 56 institutions were featured in the 500 universitiesthat made it to the ‘Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020’.

Stating that India was once known as Vishwaguru and the education capital of the world, he urged Universities and other institutions to regain the past glory so that India once again attains its position of eminence in education field.

Pointing out that education was the key to fast-tracking development while ensuring social justice and equal opportunities to all, the Vice President called for enhancing investment in education from the current 4.6 percent of GDP to 6 percent of GDP as mandated by the NITI Aayog.

He urged big businesses to come forward and strengthen educational institutions across the country. “The future of India’s education lies in effective and efficient models of Public-Private partnerships,” he added.

He also called for immediate steps to bring in a shift from rote-learning to conceptual and application-oriented learning to promote innovation, entrepreneurship, research and skill development to realize India’s Demographic dividend and make it a manufacturing hub and human resources capital of the world.

Asking the educational institutions to provide holistic, value-based education to inculcate cultural, social and moral values in students, the Vice President said that the new education policy must include the rich history of the country and the life stories of the great men and women.

Underlining the importance of protecting and promoting the mother tongue, Shri Naidu emphasized that there should not be any imposition of a language, nor should there be opposition.

Stating that healthy youth population was vital for the progress of the nation, the Vice President advised the youngsters to avoid junk food and maintain fitness by undertaking regular physical activities.

Calling upon the people to protect the environment, he said that it was the sacred duty of every individual to pass its bounties to the future generations. “If we do not take remedial measures now, these damages will become irreversible,” he warned.

The Vice President released a commemorative postal stamp brought out by the postal department on the occasion of the centenary of the National College.

ThiruVellamandiN.Natarajan, The Minister for Tourism, Govt of Tamil Nadu, President, National College, Dr. V. Krishnamurthy, Secretary, National College, Shri K. Raghunathan, Director, National College, Dr. K. Anbarasu, Executive Committee Member, National College, Shri N.L. Rajah, Principal, National College, Dr. R. Sundararaman, and others were present. 

Following is the full text of the speech –

“It is my pleasure to be here with all of you on the momentous occasion of the inauguration of Centenary Celebrations of National College, Tiruchirappalli.

The nationalist philosophy of three committed teachers from this town, G. SeshaIyengar, P.G. SundaresaSastrigal and B.S. VenkataramanaSarma, led to the setting up of a School in June 1886. 

By June 1919, this humble undertaking had grown in leaps and bounds to become a full-fledged College, thanks to the efforts of Justice T.V. SeshagiriIyer, Sri. T. Desikachariar, N.D. SubbaramaIyer and Shri. Sivarama Krishna Iyer.

I feel blessed to visit the College where the luminaries like the father of our nation Mahatma Gandhi and the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru have addressed the gathering on various occasions. 

I can very well imagine the ups and downs and the challenges that an institution, that stood firm for 100 years, must have endured and overcome. I congratulate the management for enabling the sustained growth of this institution. 

I am happy to learn that the College has been catering to the educational needs of downtrodden communities from villages of Tamil Nadu. 

When the national average of Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education stood at 26.3 percent in 2018-19, Tamil Nadu topped in the nation with 46.9 percent gross enrollment ratio. I believe that this feat has been achieved because of the dedicated efforts of institutions such as the National College that cater to rural areas.

My dear sisters and brothers, 

With its large network of educational institutions, India holds an important place in the global education industry.

India has the world’s largest population in the age bracket of 5-24 years, of about 500 million, and this presents a great opportunity for our education sector to grow. 

The last few decades saw the expansion of the education sector to cater to the explosion in demand. I believe that the coming decade must be a time for consolidation, a time to evaluate the gains made so far, a time to introspect and identify gaps and a time to chart a new path to move forward. 

Literacy in India has been one of the key deterrents to the socio-economic progress of the country. Although our Literacy rate has risen significantly, from 17% at the end of 1950 to 76% currently, India still has the largest illiterate population in the world, with its literacy rate remaining below the world average of 86%.

Literacy is the first step to empowerment. We must hence step-up the pace of our literacy campaigns, especially those that have an impact on adult literacy. 

Though India is home to premier institutions like IISc., IIT, IIM, only 56 institutions were featured in the 500 universities that made it to the ‘Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020’. However, not a single Indian university features in the top 300 list.

In ancient times, India was the education capital of the world. With legendary universities like Nalanda, Takshashila and Vikramshila, India was the seat of wisdom, the cradle of civilization, the ‘Viswaguru’ or the teacher to the world. 

Education in ancient India was free, egalitarian and accessible to both men and women. The curriculum was comprehensive and placed equal emphasis on the intellectual, emotional, psychological and physical development of the students. 

If we are to restore this ancient glory, we must endeavor to fortify our modern education system with the wisdom gleaned from our ancient texts and practices, distilled in a relatable, rational and lucid manner, keeping in view the application of this wisdom to today’s real-world challenges. 

This ancient wisdom is India’s uniqueness and its greatest strength. We will be doing a grave injustice to posterity if we do not preserve, protect and promote this treasure trove of wisdom, handed down to us by generations of wise men and women. 

My dear sisters and brothers, 

Today,we dream of being a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2022, borne by stable fundamentals, enabling policies, cutting-edge science and technology and ingenious innovations. But there are also pockets in the nation where poverty, illiteracy and social evils persist. 

The key to fast-tracking development while ensuring social justice and equal opportunities to all, is a good education. 

Investing in education is investing in a bright future for the country. 

 

We must, therefore, step up our investment in education from the current 4.6 percent of GDP to 6 percent of GDP, as mandated by the NITI Aayog. 

The private sector must also take an active interest in investing in education. The future of India’s education lies in effective and efficient models of Public-Private partnerships. 

We need to also create a pool of teachers who are well versed in their subjects and are excellent communicators. We must train our teachers to recognize and understand the unique talents of each child and render an educational experience that brings out the best in the student. 

Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam once said that “Educationists should build the capacities of the spirit of inquiry, creativity, entrepreneurial and moral leadership among students and become their role model.”

We must also bring about an immediate shift from rote-learning to conceptual and application-oriented learning.

India has done very well in certain areas of Science and Technology, especially in Space Technology and Information and Communication Technology. In fact Indian Computer Science experts work in the key positions of leadership in several IT global majors. 

India has the potential to be the manufacturing hub and the human resources capital of the world. 

But to achieve this goal, we must ensure that we have a vast pool of skilled manpower. Our Universities must become centers of excellence in skill training. 

The kind of development that we aspire for and the time-frame that we have set for ourselves requires huge investment in Research and Development and a constant commitment towards innovation. Every university must have a research wing. 

Research must not be limited to those pursuing a doctoral degree. Undergraduate students in universities must also be encouraged to undertake research activities. Innovation must become the culture of our universities. 

It is time for our educational institutions to break the molds of conventional study disciplines. Some of the most exciting possibilities lie in the intersection of disciplines. We must encourage our Science students to pursue Social Sciences and we must promote understanding of scientific breakthroughs in our social studies majors. 

Only then will we be able to envision pragmatic and effeftive solutions to the daunting challengs of our time. 

Regardless of what stream of education they are pursuing, we must endevour to teach all our students the rich history of our country and the life stories of the great men and women who gave shape and form to this great nation.

Our students must draw inspiration from our glorious history to create a magnificent future.

Another important message that I would like to communicate to the youngsters is that of environmental protection. For some time now, the world has been experiencing the deleterious effects of climate change. If we do not take remedial measures now, these damages will become irreversible.

We are, but mere trustees of this planet.

It is our sacred duty to pass its bounties on to the future generation

Last but not the least, let me stress that educational institutions form the central pillar of every civil society. 

It is their duty to raise intelligent, honest, socially conscious, ethical and compassionate citizens who will safeguard the democratic ethos of this diverse and vibrant nation. 

We must inculcate cultural, social and moral values in our students.

For this to happen, the education we provide must compulsarily be value based and holistic.

I once again congratulate the National College on achieving this crucial milestone. I hope that this institution will grow from strength to strength in the time to come. 

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

                Cautioning that the culture and history it represents will disappear when a language becomes extinct, the Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu called for popularizing the usage of Sanskrit by simplifying the words.

Inaugurating the 50th session of All India Oriental Conference in Nagpur today, the Vice President said Sanskrit should be simplified so that common man understands it. New words can be added as and when required. 

Observing that a language should not be seen through the prism of religion or community, Shri Naidu said “Vedas, Upanishads and Sanskrit belong to the entire country. Everybody should have access to learn a language.”  

He wanted all ancient books to be translated into  various regional languages for the younger generation to understand the culture, traditions and history of  India.

In this context, Shri Naidu pointed out that extensive research on Sanskrit was being undertaken in Germany, while India was not paying adequate attention to the growth and promotion of the language. 

Highlighting the importance of literary and linguistic sources in history writing, Shri Naidu said that a language was not just a medium of communication and rather it represents a whole culture – a whole civilisation.

“Our languages are a common thread that connects us with our past and the future,” he added.

Observing that India has around 19,500 languages and dialects, the Vice President expressed his concern that around 196 languages were reportedly facing extinction.

Asserting that no nation would make progress if it neglects its history, the Vice President wanted the education system to be revamped to include real Indian history and stories about heroes such as Tukaram, Gyaneswar, Narayan Guru, Alluri Sitaramaraju and Veerapandian Kattabomman and others.  

Shri Naidu called for increasing the usage of Indian languages in education, administration and in daily life. He urged all state governments and Centre to provide education up to high school in local official languages or mother tongue.  

The Union Minister for Transport and Highways, Shri Nitin Gadkari, Energy Minister of Govt of Maharashtra, Shri Nitin Raut, Vice Chancellor, Kavikulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University, Professor Shrinivasa Varakhedi, President All India Oriental Conference, Prof. Gautam Patel, and others were present.

                Expressing serious concern over rising money power eroding the credibility of the country’s democratic polity, Vice President of India and Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for effective laws of Parliament in quick time and simultaneous polls to check the menace. Speaking at a conference on ‘Money Power in Politics’ organized by the Foundation for Democratic Reforms, Bharat Institute of Public Policy and the University of Hyderabad, in Hyderabad today, Shri Naidu spoke at length on the causes and consequences of unbridled use of money by both the governments and political parties to lure the voters. 

            Shri Naidu noted that it is a reality that a millionaire has much better chances of becoming an MP or an MLA at the cost of the honest and more deserving low income Indians and referred to the assets of 475 members of the present Lok Sabha accounting for 88% of the 533 members whose declared assets were examined being in several crores. 

            The Vice President   said; “Two glaring distortions (in democratic polity) need to be addressed by the political system with a sense of urgency and unity. The first is the use of enormous money power-often unaccounted for and illegal- in politics and elections. The second is the increasing attempts to entice the voters (by the governments) with short term benefits at the cost of long term goals of ensuring basic amenities, infrastructure, quality education and healthcare and growth and job opportunities.”

            Shri Naidu lamented that “Unregulated higher election expenses foster corruption and threaten quality of governance through compromised policy making and administration besides undermining the fairness of the election process.” Referring to the entry barriers and denial of level playing field to the more capable and public spirited by the rich, he has pitched for a strict code of conduct for the political parties with regard to the source of funding, expenditure on political training and mobilization of cadres and other political activities, funding of elections and candidates etc. 

            Urging the political parties of the world’s largest democracy not to shy away from being financially accountable in the interest of transparency of the country’s democratic polity, Shri Naidu said; “I suggest that Parliament should think of making a law for ensuring transparency in the polity through appropriate and actionable regulatory measures to make accounts of political parties public.” He further said that several other democracies have systems in place under which finances of political parties are regularly audited. 

            The Vice President observed that short term benefits offered by the governments in the form of populist schemes for electoral advantage are at the cost of their ability to perform main functions besides adversely impacting the long term interests of the poor and the middle class. He urged the economists, social scientists, media and civil society to evolve mechanisms to find a reasonable balance between short term income boosting and long term development and poverty eradication objectives. Shri Naidu said; “Perhaps, time has come to consider a suitable legislation on the lines of FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act that puts a cap on Fiscal Deficit). If a cap is introduced on the proportion of budgetary resources that can be deployed for short term benefits by law, then perhaps, all political parties will have a level playing field and reckless and unsustainable populist measures can be kept under check.”

            Referring to the proposals of state funding of elections and simultaneous polls in the public domain as part of electoral reforms and the experience of too frequent elections since 1967, Shri Venkaiah Naidu noted that “Time has come for the idea of simultaneous polls to be seriously considered for its many advantages including reducing the costs of holding polls and spending by political parties.” He urged the political parties to deeply consider this proposal and evolve a consensus.

            On the issue of simultaneous polls, Shri Naidu further said; “There are certain apprehensions in some political parties that simultaneous polls may benefit some parties with larger support base and charismatic leadership to the detriment of others. This apprehension does not seem to be well founded as the Indian voter has demonstrated his maturity in voting.”

            Shri Naidu noted that state funding of elections is fraught with too many issues of implementation to be resolved besides being a double edged weapon as it could adversely impact mass political engagement by the parties as opined by some commentators. 

            Stating that democracy has stabilized in the country by taking deep roots over the last 70 years, Shri Naidu said that it is however, afflicted by ‘quality deficit’ which needs to be addressed by eradicating identity based voting and voting for cash. He called for educating voters to wean away from voting for money as it amounts to the highest form of moral compromise besides eroding the sanctity of electoral process. Shri Naidu noted that voting for cash and other allurements results in forfeiting the right to take the government voted for to task for its failure to deliver on the promises made.

            Shri Naidu hoped that some effective measures would be put in place before the country begins to celebrate the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022, to checkmate the role of money power in the polity of the country. 

            He urged the citizens to chose their representatives based on ‘Character, Conduct, Calibre and Capacity’ and not to be guided by ‘Cash, Caste, Community and Criminal prowess’ of the candidates.

General Secretary of the Foundation for Democratic Reforms, Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan, representatives of Bharat Institute of  Public Policy and the University of Hyderabad were among the dignitaries who attended the event.

 

Following is the full text of the speech –

            “General Secretary of the Foundation for Democratic Reforms  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan, representatives of  Bharat Institute of  Public Policy and the University of Hyderabad, distinguished invitees including political scientists, analysts and experts and friends from the media! 

            At the outset, I would like to compliment the Foundation for Democratic Reforms, Bharat Institute of Public Policy and the University of Hyderabad for organizing this first annual conference on 'Indian Democracy at Work' with the theme of 'Money Power in Politics'. 

            Indian democracy has proved to be a miracle by the way it has expanded and consolidated in our country during the last seven decades defying the doomsayers.  It has also proved to be a theoretical surprise defying the traditional theory that democracy succeeds only in high income societies and have bleak prospects in poor and diverse societies. 

            At the stroke of independence, India was both poor and illiterate besides a diverse society which was not amenable for the survival of democracy. But the saga of the journey of democracy in our country has disproved all such assumptions. In the first General Elections held in 1952, 10.59 crore voters accounting for 61.14% of the eligible voters exercised their franchise. In the last General Elections held in 2019, 73.64 core voters accounting for 67.09% of the eligible voters went to the  voting booths in the highest ever voter turnout so far. This ever increasing voter turnout and enthusiastic participation holding mirror to the durability of our democracy is nothing short of miracle. 

The democracy at work in India is marked by staggering complexity and surprising efficiency of holding elections. We need to briefly reflect on the reasons for consolidation of democracy in our country. Democratic form of governance is not new to India. Ancient India has the glorious traditions of democratic republics prior to 6th Century BC.  Vaishali in Bihar has been acknowledged by many historians as the World's First Republic.  During the times of the Rig-Veda, democratic institutions called 'Sabha' and 'Samiti' existed. Even during the days of Gowtama Budha, 2500 years ago, India had many self-governing republics in the form of Janapadas. Licchavis were a well-known republic. During the Chola period, around 1000AD, local governance and democracy flourished. 

These ancient republics were destroyed due to wars among the kings but the democratic ideas continued to flourish.  These historical facts emphasize that democratic mindset is inherent to our ethos and culture. 

During the colonial era under British rule, India came under centralized control of alien rulers and there was no self-governance. 

Our Constitution-makers embarked on an unprecedented, extraordinary journey when they decided on creating a democratic republic based on individual liberty, fundamental rights, and universal adult franchise.

The Election Commission of India has been playing an effective role in conducting elections in the country and deserves compliments.  Indian democracy has shown refreshing capacity to adapt to changing conditions, and uphold democratic institutions and practices.

Brothers and Sisters! 

            In terms of sheer numbers and the extent of participation of masses, not only did democracy and liberty endure in India, but the nation also achieved several notable successes.  The largely peaceful integration of over 500 princely states of every conceivable form of diversity into the Indian Union is an unmatched accomplishment in human history.  In a world in which most nation-states are struggling with multi-lingual societies, India built a stable framework for coexistence of twenty two languages, and linguistic reorganization of states proved to be a great triumph of common sense and pragmatism. While India was only quasi-federal in the early years of the republic, a true federal republic has been built over the past two decades, with states coming into their own. But the question that we need to ponder is whether we are the best democracy in the World.  It is the quality of democracy in terms of free and fair political and electoral processes and the quality of governance that really matter.  Nevertheless, there are many increasingly evident distortions in our electoral process which are undermining our accomplishments and impeding the twin national goals of poverty eradication and rapid economic growth. 

Two glaring distortions need to be addressed by the political system with a sense of urgency and unity. The first is the use of enormous money power – often unaccounted and illegal – in politics and elections. The second is the increasing attempts to entice the voters with short term benefits at the cost of the long-term goals of basic amenities, infrastructure, quality education and healthcare and growth and job opportunities

Before I focus on money power in politics, let me briefly address the issue of short term benefits at the cost of long term goals of eradication of poverty and enhancement of incomes. In every democracy there is clash between the short term political expediency to entice the voters, and the long term public good the elected legislatures and governments are sworn to promote. Poverty can only be eradicated by enhancing real incomes and creating economic opportunities to all, particularly to the poor and deprived. Basic amenities like drinking water, storm water drainage, sewerage, pollution control, mosquito control, protection from vagaries of nature are the very purposes for which people pay taxes.  If governments fail in delivering them, the rich will fend for themselves, but the poor suffer disproportionately.  Quality infrastructure – in particular an efficient, reliable transport system and electricity – is critical for economic activity, job creation and prosperity.

Quality school education for every single child is a vital necessity to enhance human capabilities and fulfill the potential.   Poverty can be ended only when every child gets good education; skills are improved, jobs are created and incomes rise. 

Quality healthcare for every person is critical to eliminate pain and suffering, and to enhance productivity.  

Short term benefits offered for electoral advantage are at the cost of the government’s ability to perform its main functions.  The poor and middle classes will be most affected and growth will be retarded if there is failure of government in maintenance of rule of law, basic amenities, infrastructure, education and healthcare. 

Economists, social scientists, media and civil society need to come together to evolve mechanisms to find a reasonable balance between the short term poverty alleviation and long term poverty eradication. Perhaps a time has come to consider a suitable legislation on the lines of FRBM Act.  If a cap is introduced on the proportion of budgetary resources that can be deployed for short term benefits by law, then perhaps all parties will have a level playing field, and reckless and unsustainable populist promises can be kept under check.  Ultimately transparent budgeting, local empowerment to enable people to see how tax money is translating into tangible services, and better service delivery are critical to help citizens make informed political choices. 

The issue needs urgent attention.  A combination of wise political leadership, enlightened public opinion and practical legislative measures with broad national consensus is needed to address this great political and fiscal challenge.

 

Let me now address the issue of growing role of money power in our political life. Political process in a democracy costs money.  Parties are necessary vehicles for political participation of citizens and mobilization of people and public opinion.  Parties need money to run their offices and legitimate activities.  Elections cost money for the parties and candidates to convey their message to voters, and for the people to make informed choices.  

It is usually said that money speaks in many ways, but the problem arises if the money comes to influence the political activities and electoral processes thereby eroding the credibility of the polity and the elections.  Elections and electoral processes are the fountainhead of the sanctity of parliamentary democracy.  The purity or the impurity of these processes determines the quality and the sanctity of our polity. The expanding role of money in politics and the elections over the years have given rise to serious concerns which need to be addressed immediately.  In the process, it has emerged that if you are a millionaire, you have better chances of becoming an MP or an MLA at the cost of a more qualified candidate who is poor.  The money power is placing entry barriers to the more deserving but who are less endowed in terms of resources. 

If 543 is a reasonably good sample for any survey from which certain conclusions and inferences can be drawn, India qualifies to be among the richest in the world, going by the rising number of wealthy parliamentarians.  

According to a report, of the 533 candidates elected to the 17th Lok Sabha last year and whose declared assets were examined, 475 accounting for 88% of the total are 'crorepatis'.  This paradox of poor India with rich parliamentarians is raising concerns about growing role of money power in politics.

It has been reported that money power influences election processes in 40 wide ranging ways.  These include selecting a candidate, setting up dummy candidates, financing weaker candidates of other parties, hiring vehicles, buying space in media, bribing voters through money, biryani, alcohol and consumer goods etc.   Abuse of money in politics chokes democracy besides compromising with its integrity.  

The most troublesome feature of our elections in recent decades is the rise of illegitimate expenditure for vote buying.  While the picture varies, in several states an expenditure of Rs 5-10 crore by a candidate for State Assembly constituency is no longer regarded as unusual.  While the legal ceiling of expenditure currently stands at Rs 28 lakh for an assembly constituency in major States and Rs 70 lakh for a Lok Sabha seat, the actual expenditure in several states is 20 times that ceiling or more.  I understand that most of that money is spent for distribution of money or gifts to voters. We should not allow the integrity of our democracy to buckle under the weight of money.  

During the last year’s general elections, the Election Commission has seized Rs.839 cr in cash, drugs and narcotics worth Rs.1300 cr, liquor worth Rs.249 cr, gold and silver with a value of Rs.986 cr and other freebies and items meant for distribution to voters worth Rs.58 cr. Despite the best efforts of the Election Commission, we all know that these seizures worth a total of Rs.3,500 cr were only a tip of the iceberg. Where does all this money come from? It was all unaccounted black money.

This distribution of money to entice voters obviously has grave consequences to our democracy and electoral process.  Corruption becomes endemic as political activity is fueled by abuse of power.  Huge entry barriers are being created in politics, and most honest, public spirited, competent citizens cannot enter the political arena.  The parties are forced to opt for wealthy candidates who can spend vast sums of money, disregarding the requirements of clean politics and good governance. As a result of this vast, illegitimate expenditure the whole democratic process is undermined and the legitimacy of the system is getting eroded. It is also corroding faith in democracy and promoting cynicism.  

Higher election expenses foster corruption and threaten quality of governance through compromised policy making and administration besides undermining the  fairness of the election process.  It also fosters collusive deal making among the politicians, elected wealthy representatives and the executive, with winners expecting to be compensated for the huge expenditure incurred to make it to the legislatures

The money power in politics is also a concern in other democracies.  The British Justice Ministry in 2008 while expressing concern about the 'Commercialization of Elections' brought out a report on party finance and expenditure. It was stated in the report that while elections should be contests of ideas and visions but recently they have been over shadowed by a chase to raise vast sums of money. 

Supreme Court of India also reaffirmed that money is bound to play an important part in the successful pursuit of an election campaign in Kanwar Lal Gupta Vs Amarnath Chawla case.  Voters get influenced by the visibility of a candidate and party and huge election spending thus impacts voter’s choice. 

Mere expenditure ceilings and exhortations are not enough.  Nor will blaming parties and politicians help. Good sense and wisdom lie in applying correctives to address the problem rather than throwing blame. If vast, unaccounted, illegitimate expenditure has become a growing, near nation-wide problem, then we should realize that it is a result of a systemic problem that we failed to correct over time. The former Prime Minister Late Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee voiced his concern over abuse of money power and said and I quote ""Every Legislator starts his career with the lie of false election return he files"".  This, in effect means that a law maker becomes a law maker by flouting the laws right at the start.

Brothers and Sisters!

            Over the years, several Committees have examined some of the major challenges and issues affecting India's electoral system and have made some recommendations.  The Law Commission of India in its 170th Report on ""Reform of the Electoral Laws"" in 1999 and the Election Commission of India in its Report in 2004 on ""Proposed Electoral Reforms"" have addressed some of the issues.  The Goswami Committee on Electoral Reforms in 1990, the Vohra Committee Report in 1993, the Indrajeet Gupta Committee on State Funding of Elections in 1998, the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution in 2001 and the Second Administrative Reforms Commission in 2008 have also examined these issues.   Recently, the Law Commission in its 255th Report has also made several recommendations on electoral reforms under 3 categories namely viz., limits on political contribution and party candidate expenditure, disclosure norms and requirements and state funding of elections.  These recommendations of the Law Commission are under consideration of the government.  

            In the context of the rising money power in politics, some prominent ideas engaging the public attention are  state funding of elections and simultaneous polls.

            Implementation of state funding of elections in our context is fraught with too many issues of implementation. These include;  the quantum of funds to be made available to each party, basis of such allocation, funding of independent candidates, such funding either before or after elections, implications of such funding for regional and national parties, it’s impact on engaging masses in political activities, provisioning such funding etc.  Moreover, state funding of elections would meet the purpose only if no other source of funding is tapped by the political parties and candidates.  According to some commentators, state funding of elections is a double edged weapon, which while seeking to curb the money power would also impact the political parties in engaging with the masses and this in turn will impact their political participation.  The much required political consensus in this regard is in any case still elusive.

            On the other hand, holding simultaneous polls is an idea worth considering.  The Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice has examined this subject 'Feasibility of holding simultaneous elections to the House of People (Lok Sabha) and State Legislative Assemblies' and presented its report to the Parliament on 17th December 2015. The Committee while underscoring the need to evolve national consensus on the issue felt that and I quote ""...in the larger context of economic development and implementation of election promises without creation of the impediments due to enforcement of Model Code of Conduct as a result of frequent elections, the prospects of holding simultaneous elections need to be weighed and deeply considered by all political parties"".  The committee expressed the hope that a solution will be found to reduce frequency of elections which relieve people and government machinery of frequent elections. 

            In the light of the experience of frequent elections since 1967 and the consequences, I feel that time has come for the idea of simultaneous polls to be seriously considered.  The Law Commission of India in its 170th Report in June 1999 also favoured holding simultaneous elections. There are certain apprehensions in some political quarters that simultaneous polls may benefit some parties with larger support base and charismatic leadership to the detriment of others.  This apprehension does not seem to be well founded as the Indian voter has demonstrated his maturity in voting differently for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.  Simultaneous polls could also significantly bring down the cost of holding elections by the Election Commission of India and also the expenditure by the political parties besides other advantages.  Hence, I urge upon the political parties to seriously consider the option of simultaneous polls and evolve a consensus.  

 

I strongly feel that there is a need for a strict code of conduct to be adhered to by the political parties with regard to their source of funding, expenditure on political training of cadres and their mobilization and other political activities, funding of elections and candidates etc. Political parties of the world's largest democracy should not shy away from being financially accountable as it would enhance the transparency of our democratic polity.  Several other democracies have systems in place under which finances of political parties are regularly audited.  

Campaign finance needs should be met by the society honestly and transparently, and the existing mechanisms need to be strengthened.  Service delivery should become predictable and assured to citizens. The governance system must be transformed into a fair, transparent, rule-based, equitable and predictable system.

I suggest that Parliament should think of making a law for ensuring transparency in the polity through appropriate and actionable regulatory measures to make accounts of political parties public.

We can't afford this trend to go unchecked as it taints the integrity of our parliamentary democracy. The societal norms where money power and muscle power dominate over moral power and spirit of service make this change a little difficult. 

            Paid news is a manifestation of the rising money power in politics.  Paid news is obviously fake news as it seeks to promote an unworthy candidate at the cost of the worthy in the elections.  Election Commission has been acting against paid news but much more needs to be done to eliminate this electoral abuse.  Media as the fourth pillar of democracy should rise to the occasion and not fall prey to the lure of paid news.

At times, we are witnessing systematic spread of fake news through social media by vested interests to polarize society which can even affect fair election process. The Face book- Cambridge Analytica data scandal is just an example of this. Elaborate discussions should be held by all stakeholders to suggest adequate larger measures to promote positive aspects of social media and curb the negative effects.

            Brothers and Sisters!

Money power in politics cannot be controlled by the election commission alone. Besides political parties, civil society, the corporate and organizations working for electoral reforms have a larger role to play in countering this.  More importantly, it is the citizen-voter who should take the lead in preventing the abuse of money power. Voters should realize that selling vote for a few thousand is the highest form of moral compromise that militates against democratic ethics.  If a citizen sells his vote, he forfeits the right to take the government he voted for to task in case of the failure to deliver on the promises. We need to fix the governance system along with bold electoral reforms in order to break the vicious cycle of corruption and erosion of the quality of our democratic polity. Effective campaigns need to be undertaken to educate the voters about the virtue and the power of their votes and the adverse implications of compromised voting.

            Citizens should vote in the elections based on four Cs namely, Character, Conduct, Caliber, and Capability and not based on the adverse set of four Cs namely Cash, Cast, Community and Criminal prowess. That’s the ultimate solution.

            To sum up, democracy has stabilized in our country by taking deep roots over the last seven decades but it is afflicted by ‘quality deficit’.  For democracy to succeed in our country, the ill-effects of identity-based voting and voting for money should be eradicated at the earliest.  Holding simultaneous polls and an act of parliament for 'effective regulation of political finance', besides transformation of voters to shun money for vote are critical to enhance the quality of our democracy.  Our society and political leadership have the ability to resolve our problems.  Indian people are hungry for clean politics and good governance. But they must vote in a more mature and responsible manner and political parties must be made accountable to their promises and performance.

            I fondly hope that before we begin to celebrate the 75th anniversary of our Independence in 2022, some effective measures would be put in place to checkmate the role of money power in our polity.

            I compliment Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan for his sustained efforts for generating public awareness about clean politics and its merits.

            I am indeed happy to have got this opportunity of sharing my thoughts on the causes and consequences of ‘Money power in politics.’ I compliment all of you for your participation in this conference on such an important and topical issue. 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called upon the scientific community to find long-term solutions to the problems faced by farmers and improve crop productivity and farmers’ income.

He also wanted scientists to explore ways to make crops climate-resilient, nutrition-efficient and less water consuming.

Delivering the Valedictory Speech at the 107th Indian Science Congress in Bengaluru, the Vice President said that global warming and climate change were affecting the weather patterns in an unpredictable manner and causing massive devastation at times. He sought to know from the scientists whether the problems faced by farmers due to nature’s fury could be mitigated.

Calling for concerted efforts, Shri Naidu emphasized upon the critical role of technology in enhancing both the quality and quantity across the agriculture value chain from the use of inputs at the pre-production stage to post-production and marketing to improve the income of farmers.

The Vice President, while noting how technology was making our lives more comfortable, said that at the same time new challenges were arising. He said science must find solutions to problems like increasing urbanization, pollution, urban-rural divide, growing antibacterial resistance, genetic & non-communicable diseases and water scarcity, among others. 

Urging schools to lay the foundation for the spread of a strong scientific culture in the country, he stressed that such a foundation would become the basis for creating an ecosystem for creativity and innovation to thrive. 

“The need of the hour is to foster the spirit of inquisitiveness, curiosity and scientific temper right from the primary school level”, he said.

Observing that there was a crying need for our universities and scientific institutions to promote R & D on a big scale, the Vice President called for expanding the academia-industry linkage to promote research and innovation in a big way. Technological innovation was a key driver in boosting economy, improving people’s lives and enabling better delivery of services he added. 

“India like no other country has a huge demographic dividend and can emerge as the innovation and knowledge if our universities and scientific institutions invest more on R & D and significantly the raise the standards of research”, Shri Naidu stressed.

The Vice President also urged the corporate India to develop a symbiotic partnership with the universities and to identify and fund a dozen futuristic projects.

Opining that India was surging forward with renewed vigour and enthusiasm, the Vice President said that it must leverage the demographic opportunity with science and technology playing a leading role in driving the economic and social development in order to make the country a $ 5 trillion economy.

Shri Naidu lauded the government initiatives such as Make in India, Digital India and Start-Up India that promote indigenous manufacturing, empower people digitally and wealth-creation through innovation.

He wanted senior scientists to mentor and hand-hold the young ones to benefit from such schemes and realize their scientific and entrepreneurial potential. 

Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri B.S. Yediyurappa, General President of Indian Sciences Congress, K.S. Rangappa, and the, Vice-Chancellor, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, Dr. S. Rajendra Prasad were among the dignitaries who graced the occasion.

Following is the full text of the speech- 

“Namaskara, nimagellahosavarshadashubhashayagalu!

New Year Greetings to you all!

I am delighted to deliver the valedictory address at the 107th Indian Science Congress, a prestigious annual event.

It is quite appropriate that this important meeting of scientific minds is being held on the campus of an Agricultural University. As you all are aware, agriculture plays a vital role in the overall growth of the economy.

For the past many years, agriculture has been facing distress in spite of the measures taken by successive governments at the Centre and in various States to improve crop productivity and incomes of the farmers.

Dear sisters and brothers,

Agriculture is close to my heart as I come from a farmer’s family. I understand the pain and suffering of farmers when they face adverse seasonal conditions or natural calamities.

Global warming and climate change are real and cannot be wished away any longer. They are affecting weather patterns in an unpredictable manner and at times causing massive devastation. Can we not mitigate the problems faced by farmers due to nature’s fury? 

Can science throw up answers to these and other pressing problems faced by the farmers? How to improve soil fertility? How to make crops climate-resilient and nutrition-efficient? How to improve productivity with less water consumption? 

For too long the farmer has been ploughing a lonely furrow, I feel the time has come for all the important stakeholders involved in building a New India, the scientific community in particular, to pay urgent attention to farmers problems and find long-term solutions . It should be remembered that a country like India cannot depend on imported food security. We need to have our own home-grown food security. Unless there are concerted efforts in this direction, I am afraid that more and more people will leave agriculture and shift to other occupations.

I don’t think I need to overemphasize the critical role technology can play in enhancing both the quality and quantity across the agriculture value chain from the use of inputs at the pre-production stage to post-production storage, processing, packaging and marketing to improve the income of farmers.

The use of technology, including ICT, would not only help improve efficiency but would also result in reducing the cost of production. Scientific research should also focus on making advanced machinery for a variety of agricultural activities from spraying to post-harvest handling of produce. Thus, the adoption of modern technology can greatly help to realise our vision to double the income of farmers in the coming years.

Dear sisters and brothers, new technological advances and inventions are changing our lives like never before. No doubt, these advances are making our lives more comfortable and improving the ease of living. At the same time, new challenges are arising—- science must find solutions to problems like increasing urbanization, pollution, urban-rural divide,  growing antibacterial resistance, genetic & non-communicable diseases, water scarcity, among others. 

We must balance scientific advancement with the protection of environment. We must focus on productivity and efficiency but never forget that the bottom line of all our efforts is improved quality of life not merely greater prosperity.

In fact, that has been the Indian vision of holistic development. I would like to recall what the famous Indian scientist AcharyaJagdish Chandra Bose had said while inaugurating the Bose Institute in 1917, about the multi-disciplinary approach and the inter-related aspects of life where “the lines of physics, physiology and psychology converge.” 

In our labs and research centres, in our schools and colleges, we should create an ecosystem for innovation to thrive where “the genius of India should find its true blossoming” as Jagdish Chandra Bose had said.

The need of the hour is to foster the spirit of inquisitiveness, curiosity and scientific temper right from the  primary school level. 

Science teaching plays an important role in this regard. It must ignite young minds and create a passion for science. Schools must sow the seeds for scientific temper and create an un-quenching curiosity to learn and understand new things.

In short, schools must lay the foundation for the spread of a strong scientific culture in the country. Such a foundation will be the basis for creating an ecosystem for creativity and innovation to thrive. I am happy that Atal Tinkering Labs have been set up in thousands of schools across the country.

I am also glad that India has moved from 81st position in 2015 to 52nd rank in the Global Innovation Index in 2019. Technological innovation is one of the key drivers to boost economy, improve people’s lives and enable better delivery of services. We need to further improve our ranking in the coming years. 

There is also a crying need for our universities and scientific institutions to promote R & D on a big scale. The academia-industry linkage has to be expanded not only to provide employment to those coming out of the portals of higher education institutions, but also to promote research and innovation in a big way.

India, like no other country, has a huge demographic dividend waiting to be realized. If we don’t make the big leap forward in terms of quality of learning in our educational institutions, we will have missed a great opportunity.

We have to invest more on R & D and focus on enhancing the intellectual capital through radically new approaches which will have to be  forward looking and more receptive to adaptation of the best ideas as well as seeking solutions required for our country and global contexts.. As the Prime Minister, ShriNarendraModi had stated the other day, the mantra should be ‘ Innovate, Patent, Produce and Prosper’.

I also would like to appeal from this forum to the Corporate India to develop a symbiotic partnership with the universities and other academic institutions and contribute towards promoting R & D. 

Dear sisters and brothers,

The India of today is surging forward with renewed vigour and enthusiasm. 

As the country aims to become a $ 5 trillion economy in the coming years, we need to fully leverage the demographic advantage with science and technology playing a leading role in driving the economic and social development. On its part, the government has launched several initiatives like Make in India, Digital India and Start Up India to promote indigenous manufacturing, empower people digitally and wealth-creation through innovation. I am sure, senior scientists would be mentoring and hand-holding the young ones to benefit from such schemes and realize their scientific and entrepreneurial potential.  

I am happy to note that so many scientists have received ISCA Awards, besides Young Scientists’ Awards, and ISCA Best Poster Awards.  It is also a memorable event for many of you who have presented papers in this Science Congress. The practice of senior academics and scientists lending a helping hand to juniors in presenting scientific papers is really praise-worthy. This practice ensures the growth of the community in a healthy way. 

A word of appreciation is due to the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru for hosting the event amidst this sylvan setting.

I am sure that this event has provided a wonderful learning opportunity for all of you. I would like to congratulate the organizers led by the General President Prof. K. S Rangappa and Vice Chancellor of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru Prof. S Rajendra Prasad and his entire team and also everyone who worked tirelessly to make this 107th Indian Science Congress a grand success. 

The success of such congregations lies in the outcomes it generates, in the changed perspectives and renewed commitment to act.

It is successful if it helps to find solutions that are appropriate to our present day challenges without jeopardizing our collective future.

We are witnessing nature’s fury in myriad forms like roaring storms, raging fires, cataclysmic floods, emaciating droughts and rumbling earthquakes.  We must all get together and find an answer to the climate change. We must deliver good quality education and healthcare. We must make our cities and villages more livable. These are challenges that need innovative thinking and collaborative action. We live in an interconnected world and we need to learn how to work together to make it a safer, more peaceful and a more sustainable planet.

I would like to conclude my speech by emphasizing that all paths of science must lead to creating a better tomorrow. As we begin the new year and a new decade in our country’s history, we must build on our past and build new bridges through science and technology to a brighter future. 

I wish to conclude by quoting again from Bose’s concluding message which is relevant in today’s context as it was in 1917 when his research centre was set up:  “We stand here today and resume work tomorrow so that by our efforts of our lives and our unshaken faith in the future, we may all help to build the greater India yet to be”.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called for making India a global hub of higher learning and scholarship and urged Universities, academicians and policy makers to improve academic standards at par with top international institutions. 

Expressing concerns that none of the Indian Universities figured in the top 100 global rankings, Shri Naidu asked institutions such as NAAC and UGC to take steps to address the shortcomings by revisiting the education system and revamping the curriculum in tune with 21st century requirements. 

Speaking at the Silver Jubilee function of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in Bengaluru today, Shri Naidu expressed his concern over the recent disturbances on the campuses of a few Universities and called for maintaining peace.

Observing that Universities and educational institutions were pious places of learning, the Vice President wanted them to maintain highest standards of decorum. He stressed that the academic endeavours and co-curricular initiatives must attain primacy in universities and not factionalism and divisive tendencies.

The Vice President said that it was the duty of the education system to produce model global citizens who would contribute towards building a better world.

Pointing out that the students leaving the portals of the educational institutions must be enlightened citizens with social consciousness and responsibility towards the society, Shri Naidu stressed that Institutions must mould students into empathetic human beings with high integrity.

Stating that Mahatma Gandhi considered ‘knowledge without character’ as a sin, the Vice President said that education which teaches, values, ethics and inculcates the spirit of voluntarism and compassion was the need of the hour. He said that education system must also make the students aware of India’s glorious heritage, culture and history.   

Referring to India’s ancient centers of learning such as Nalanda, Vikramsila, Takshashila which earned global reputation, the Vice President called upon higher educational institutions to aspire to regain the past glory. 

He urged upon all Educational institutions to transform into centers of excellence where students acquire knowledge, skills and attitude necessary for a successful, happy and accomplished life. 

The Governor of Karnataka, Shri Vajubhai Vala, Director NAAC, Prof. S.C. Sharma, Adviser, Dr. Amiya Kumar Rath and Vice Chancellors of Several Universities, academicians and professors were among the dignitaries who graced the event.

Following is the full text of the speech – 

“I am happy to be here with all of you on this momentous occasion, when the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) is celebrating 25 years of excellence. 

NAAC was established in 1994 as an autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission (UGC) with its Head Quarters in Bengaluru. The mandate of NAAC, as reflected in its vision statement, is to make quality assurance an integral part of the functioning of Higher Education Institutions in the country.

NAAC evaluates the institutions for its conformance to the standards of quality in terms of educational processes and outcomes, curriculum coverage, teaching-learning processes, faculty, research, infrastructure, learning resources, organisation, governance, financial well-being and student services.

I am happy to learn that NAAC also strives to promote quality-related research studies, consultancy and training programs, and

collaborates with other stakeholders of higher education for quality evaluation, promotion and sustenance. Its efforts in encouraging self-evaluation, accountability, autonomy and innovations in higher education are indeed appreciable. 

It is heartening to note that, by networking with institutions and various stakeholders and acting on their feedback, NAAC continuously updates its manuals and methodology in tune with the changing needs of the dynamic higher education system. 

I have visited a number of NAAC accredited educational institutions after I have assumed the office of the Vice President of India. In all these institutions, I saw great potential and an unwavering commitment to excellence when it comes to the quality of education they provide. 

I must say that the accreditation framework developed by NAAC has gone a long way in augmenting the quality of higher education in India. Today, as we celebrate the many accomplishments of NAAC over the last 25 years, let me congratulate all those who have been associated with this organization for toiling hard to take it to its current lofty status. 

I am certain that in the time to come, NAAC will act as a friend, philosopher and guide to our Institutions of Higher Education, constantly raising standards and benchmarks for quality and excellence. 

My Dear sisters and brothers, 

India has one of the largest and most diverse education systems in the world. 

Privatization, widespread expansion, increased autonomy and introduction of Programs in new and emerging areas have improved access to higher education. 

At the same time, it has also led to widespread concerns about the quality of higher education. 

India is undoubtedly a country to reckon with in the globe today. Its achievements are worthy of emulation and serve as a model for any developing nation. 

With the challenges that India had after her independence, she has continuously strived to achieve several crucial milestones, be it in the area of agriculture, industry, science and technology, space science, defense and many others. 

This is a country with great potential and a very bright future. We have an incredible demographic dividend at our disposal, 65% of our population is below 35 years of age.  

According to the report, titled 'World Economic League Table 2020', released by UK-based Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), India has decisively overtaken both France and the UK to become the world's fifth-largest economy in 2019. It is expected to overtake Germany to become fourth largest in 2026 and Japan to become the third largest in 2034.

If we wish for India to have a thriving and sustainable economic growth trajectory to create a $5-trillion economy by 2024 – then we must strive to build a knowledge economy. 

There is a deep and inseverable connection between a nation’s educational institutions and its economic wellbeing. 

I believe that human capital and innovation are the two pillars of GDP growth in India. 

The workers of tomorrow need to transition to the formal, non-agricultural sector, armed with higher education credentials. 

For this to happen, we must constantly reform our institutions of higher education. 

We must draw ideas and inspiration from India’s golden past where education flourished, earning India the coveted title of being the ‘Viswaguru’. 

Right from the time of the Vedas, the Rishis and the Gurus have strived hard to educate masses through the gurukula system. 

Through well laid out mentoring plans, the mentor would interact with his disciples on a score of subjects and provide knowledge, cultivate skills and foster the attitude that was necessary for a successful, happy and accomplished life. 

India’s ancient centers of learning, Nalanda, Vikramsila, Takshashila and the likes of it were eulogized by one and all across the globe for their openness, commitment to quality and excellence

The variety of courses that were designed and implemented to build competence among the students to succeed in life, holds a lesson for us in the modern times. 

My dear sisters and brothers, 

We must first address the structural lacunae in our higher education system. 

Funding is crucial for education. Though India’s spending on education has gone up from 3.8 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2014 to 4.6 per cent, it is still inadequate. 

In its 'Strategy for New India @ 75' report the NITI Aayog has recommended that spending on education should be increased to at least 6 per cent of GDP by 2022.

We must address the large number of faculty vacancies that exist in our educational institutions. In a welcome move last year, the University Grants Commission took steps to fill around 50,000 vacancies in Institutions of higher education. 

Along with filling vacancies, we must also keep augmenting the knowledge, skills and capabilities of our teaching faculty. They must be encouraged to pursue new knowledge and explore new teaching methodologies. Their training must not be a one-time initiative but must be a continuous process. 

Quality of teaching faculty has a great bearing on learning outcomes. In this age of Information Technology, the conventional role played by teachers has undergone a massive transformation. A classroom is no longer confined within 4 walls. Our teachers must be open to new ideas and must evolve to fulfill the needs of the new-age learner. 

Another area that we must focus on is Research and Development. Innovation is the watchword of the 21st century. The array of problems that we face today, from declining agricultural productivity to climate change, from challenges of urban development to threats to human health, can be tackled through Science, Technology and innovation. 

At present, India spends less than 1% of its GDP on R&D. This must change. Research, especially Science and Technology research, is resource-intensive, time-consuming and risky. We as a society, must be prepared to bear with this risk. 

Teaching cannot be separated from research. In every higher education institution, both must go hand-in-hand and must fuel each other so that students are not deprived of exposure to cutting edge technology. 

It is a matter of grave concern that Indian universities rank low in both research and teaching. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, at rank 155, was our highest in the Scimago Institutions Rankings (SIR) for research. 

Though the number of Higher Education Institutions has surged in India since the 2000s, the number of students undertaking PhDs has not shown a corresponding hike. 

There are over a one lakh India-born PhDs in universities around the world. 

We must attract at least some of this talent back home through better opportunities and incentives so that they may help fast-track the progress of our R & D sector. 

We must also not hesitate to collaborate with the best universities and research centers around the world for knowledge sharing and capacity building. 

We must also encourage students from all over the world to come to India to study so that we may build a vibrant and diverse academic culture. 

It is a matter of grave concern that the latest ‘India Skills Report’ suggests that only 47% of Indian graduates are employable. 

Therefore, along with education, we must also impart necessary skills, including life skills to our students. 

We must boost the employability quotient of our students through practical training, internships, simulation exercises and case study-based training.  

We must also impart soft skills which are a combination of people skills, social skills, communication skills, character or personality traits, attitudes, social intelligence and emotional intelligence quotients, among others, that will enable youngsters to work well with others, perform well, and achieve their goals.

The education we give our youngsters must also be value-based. Let me remind you that Mahatma Gandhi considered ‘knowledge without character’ as a sin. 

Even as we make our students academically competent and skilled, we must also mold them to be compassionate, kind, empathetic human beings whose integrity is beyond reproach. The world is now a global village. It is the duty of the education system to create model global citizens who will build a better world. 

Our campuses must be vibrant. 

There is no doubt that there is space for every shade of opinion and every point of view in our universities. 

Our children, when they leave the portals of the educational institutions must be enlightened citizens who will take an abiding interest in protecting our democracy and preserving the fundamental values that are enshrined in our constitution. 

But our campuses must not become safe havens for the politics of hate and violence to thrive.  Academic endeavors and co-curricular initiatives must attain primacy in our universities and not factionalism and divisive tendencies. 

My dear sisters and brothers, 

The Draft National Education Policy (DNEP) released by the government in June 2019, envisions several welcome reforms and must now be further distilled and then implemented in letter and spirit.

I am confident that in the time to come, if the government and the private sector work together in collaboration with organizations like NAAC, India will soon be the global hub of higher learning and scholarship. 

Once again, I congratulate NAAC on attaining this crucial mile-stone.

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today called upon the Civil Society, NGOs and Business houses to supplement government’s efforts in eliminating malnutrition in the country.

Expressing concerns, the Vice President said that despite considerable progress made by the nation in various spheres in the past seven decades, malnutrition remains a major challenge. “It is sad state of affairs that that 35.7% of our children below 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted,” he added.

Addressing the gathering after visiting Adamya Chetana in Bengaluru today, the Vice President pointed out that various studies have shown that nutritional status of children was strongly associated with their academic performance.

“Lack of nutritious food may lead to poor brain development, weak learning, low immunity and increased infections,” he added.

Shri Naidu said that malnutrition perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty and affects the economic development. He asserted that immediate steps must be taken to avoid such scenarios for the healthy development of the children and the adolescents.

Referring to the growing incidence of Non Communicable diseases due to sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy dietary habits, the Vice President called for creating awareness among youngsters on the need to avoid junk food and maintain physical fitness at all times. 

The Vice President appreciated Adamya Chetana founded by late Shri Ananth Kumar and his spouse Smt. Tejaswini Ananth Kumar for providing food to around 1.5 lakh children from four of its kitchens located in Benguluru, Hubbali, Kalburgi and Jodhpur in Rajasthan daily.

Shri Naidu lauded the organisation for personifying age-old Indian values of Sharing and Caring. He stated that the POSHAN Abhiyaan or the National Nutrition Mission by the Government was playing a major role in improving nutrition indicators across India.

Earlier, the Vice President went around the campus and visited different facilities engaged in food preparation. He complimented the management, workers and volunteers for converting the Annapoorna kitchen into a zero garbage and fossil-fuel free kitchen.

Shri Naidu said that the orgnaisation’s process of fulfilling its energy needs from biomass and solar energy was worthy of emulation by others.

In this context, Shri Naidu said that starting of Ananth Kumar Pratishthana to develop and mentor new leaders through a Leadership Institute in all fields was a welcome step and said that it would carry forward work on healthcare and green lifestyle, both areas in which Shri Ananth Kumar ji strongly believed.

On the occasion, Shri Naidu recalled his close association with former Union Minister, late Shri Ananth Kumar and said “I not only lost a dear friend in Shri Ananth Kumar, but our nation lost a true leader. It is imperative that we continue the ideals, values and work that he espoused,”  

The Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri C. N. Ashwath Narayan, Shri Tejasvi Surya, MP, Bengaluru South, Managing Trustee and Chairperson of Adamya Chetana, Dr Tejaswini Ananth Kumar, and others associated with the organisation were present at the event.

Following is the full text of the speech – 

“It is an emotional moment for me to be amidst all of you here at Adamya Chetna today.

I am overwhelmed with the memories of my dear friend and former Union Minister, Shri Ananth Kumar Ji.

My association with Ananth Kumar ji dated back to my student days. After that, we were fellow companions since the beginning of our journey in political life. 

When I reached Delhi in those times, I stayed with Ananth Kumar ji and Tejaswini ji in their house. I always felt myself a member of their family.

On a personal note, both Ananth and I were foodies. Ananth ji, Jaitley ji and I have spentmany evenings relishing local delicacies. 

I have known about Adamya Chetana for years and have been very impressed by the dedication and meticulous way that Ananth Kumar ji and Tejaswini ji have worked on this noble platform to serve people. But I never had an opportunity to actually visit.

Today when I am here, I am truly amazed by the sheer dedication of the staff, management and volunteers who prepare hot cooked meals with deep love for around 1 lakh 50 thousand children for four of its kitchens located in Benguluru, Hubbali , Kalburgi and Jodhpur in Rajasthan daily.

You are doing commendable work!

Share and care has been the core of Indian philosophy. Ours is the culture that believes in ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ – the whole world as one family and ‘‘Sarve Janah Sukhino Bhavantu’- the happiness and wellbeing of all.

Work and principles of Adamya Chetna personify these age old values.

Dear friends,

It is a fact that despite considerable progress made by nation in various fields in past seven decades, malnutrition remains a major concern. It’s a sad state of affairs that 35.7% of our children under 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted.

A recent UNICEF report says that malnutrition is behind 69 per cent deaths among children below 5 years in our country. The report also suggests that children under the age of five years are affected by micronutrient deficiencies and there is a disturbing trend towards unhealthy food and snacking. Child diets are lacking in proteins and micronutrients.

It is a well-known fact that young children need to be fed nutritious food to support their rapidly growing body and brains. Various studies have confirmed that the nutritional status of the children is strongly associated with their academic performance. Lack of nutritious food may lead to poor brain development, weak learning, low immunity and increased infections.

A 15 year-long study by the NGO - 'Save the Children' reveals how access to nutrients affects the child's learning capacity. The study found that an eight years old malnutritioned child is 19 per cent more likely to face difficulty in reading simple sentences like 'The sun is hot.' 

Malnutrition also impacts the children's future capabilities. When today's malnourished children become part of tomorrow's working population, it impacts their earning potential. Thus malnutrition perpetuates the vicious cycle of poverty and affects the economic development.

The POSHAN Abhiyaan or the National Nutrition Mission by the Government is playing a major role in improving nutrition indicators across India. Recently only I launched Poshan Anthem at a WCD Ministry event to spread awareness about the issue of malnutrition.

Here the role and work of organisations like Adamya Chetna becomes very important in supplementing the Government’s efforts. 

Our Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi used to say, “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.”

I call upon all like-minded individuals to come forward and help the Government create a malnutrition free India.

It is also admirable that you have turned Annapoorna kitchen here into a zero garbage and fossil-fuel free kitchen. 

I am told that earlier this kitchen was consuming 400 litres of diesel and creating 300 Kilograms of waste on a daily basis. 

But now Adamya Chetna It became a zero-garbage generating unit with every leftover resourcefully reused. It is fulfilling its energy needs from biomass and solar energy. This feat is worth emulating by others.

Also, your concept of the plate bank is a unique innovation. Having 10 thousands set of steel plates, glasses that anybody can borrow free of cost to make their own functions plastic garbage free - It’s truly imaginative and farsighted idea.

Our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has given a call for plastics free India. It’s duty cast upon all of us to turn it into a people’s movement. It is next step of the Swachh Bharat Mission.

I am sure that this model of Adamya Chetana can serve as an inspiration to many. And I am not surprised by this. I have known Ananth Kumar ji and Tejaswini ji for decades and they are always committed to setting higher bar.

Last year has been a trying one for all of us. I not only lost a dear friend in Shri Ananth Kumar, but our nation lost a true leader. It is imperative that we continue the ideals, values and work that he espoused. 

In that direction, I am glad to know that you are starting Ananth Kumar Pratishthana to carry his work forward. 

Drawing inspiration from Shri Ananth Kumar ji, this Pratishthana should work on developing and mentoring new leaders through a Leadership Institute in all fields. This is a noble initiative and would help in creating a glowing future of our country.

The Pratishthana will also work on health care and green lifestyle – both areas Shri Ananth Kumar ji strongly believed in and supported. His commitment for healthcare is evident from various initiatives under his leadership such as PM Jana Aushadhi Kendras and making cardiac stents and knee implants more accessible and affordable to all. His consistent efforts for Banguluru Metro only affirm his commitment for people’s welfare and the Green lifestyle.

Shri Ananth Kumar ji conceptualized the enormously successful Green Bengaluru 1:1 program promoting planting lakhs of trees in Bengaluru and other towns. All of you know how he was personally committed to this program every Sunday (last Sunday was the 210th consecutive Sunday). 

Green Bharat program launched recently by Dr. Tejaswini ji where people can adopt a tree will take it to the next level across the nation.

These are admirable initiatives. I have always highlighted the importance of nature and culture for a better future.

Adamya Chetana is a noble effort. Its focus on Anna – Akshara – Arogya (Food – Education – Health) can serve as a role model for others to create a healthy, educated, clean and green India.

I hope AK Pratishthana will also carry forward the works that Ananth Kumar stood for.

I wish you all the very best. 

Thank you.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today appealed to people to follow the path shown by Pejavara Sri Vishveshateertha Swami Ji and work towards building a castless society in India.

He said that seers like Shri Vishveshatirtha Swami Ji have always provided succour and solace to the suffering people and always rushed to the help of the needy and poor. 

Speaking after paying homage to Sri Vishveshateertha Swami Ji at Poornaprajna Vidyapeetha in Bengaluru today, the Vice President said that Pejavara Swami Ji represented and nurtured India’s long tradition of Saints, Rishis and Munis, who acted as guiding light of society.

“Our ancient sages always kept the welfare of society above everything else. The great Puranic sage Dadhichi sacrificed his life to ensure that society remained on the path of righteousness,” he added.

Stating that the life and journey of Shri Vishveshatirtha Swami Ji was a noble chapter in the glorious tradition, the Vice President described him as a role-model for devoted social service. He said that Swamiji dedicated life to purify the cultural, religious and social values of our present-day society.

Stating that Pejavara Swamiji believed in the Gandhian principle of ‘Service to Humanity is Service to the God’, the Vice President said that Swamiji’s great and selfless deeds exemplified this noble ideal.

Shri Naidu said that Shri Swami ji had influenced innumerable lives across the length and breadth of the country through his Yatras, discourses, teachings and interactions and said that he was a true embodiment of the teachings of Srimad Bhagavadgita.

Observing that Sri Pejavara Swamiji was a progressive visionary, the Vice President said that he was among the first spiritual leaders in modern India to consider Dalits as an integral part of Hindu society.

“Swamiji’s name is synonymous with service to the scheduled castes and tribes in India and he worked hard to bring them in the mainstream of national life,” he said.

The Vice President also recalled Swamiji’s contributions in establishing Poornapragna Vidyapeetha, a Sanskrit Spiritual Pathashala and his efforts to popularise academic research in Sanskrit.

Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri C. N. Ashwath Narayan and Sri Vishvaprasannatirtha Swamiji of Sri Pejavara Mutt were among the dignitaries present on the occasion.

Following is the full text of the speech – 

“His Holiness Sri Vishvaprasannatirtha Swamiji

Devotees and disciples of Sri Vishveshatirtha Swamiji

Sisters and brothers,

I am overcome with emotion today at this Poornaprajna Vidyapeetha established by Sri Vishveshateertha Swamiji in 1956.

I had the good fortune to be blessed by Sri Sri Pejavara Vishveshatirtha Swamiji. He was a true embodiment of the teachings ofSrimadBhagavata and Bhagavatdgita. His was a life dedicated to purify the cultural, religious and social life of our present day society.

Pejavara Swamiji believed in the Gandhian principle of ‘Service to Humanity is Service to the God’. His great and selfless deedsexemplified this noble ideal.

At the age of 90, till he attained the Haripada, Sri Swamiji had influenced innumerable lives across the length and breadth of the country through his Yatra, discourses, teachings and interactions.

Our nation has a long tradition great Saints, Rishis and Munis. Since ancient times, they have been the guiding lighthouses of society. They always provided succour and solace to the suffering humanity. Vedas, Upanishads and Puranas contain the inexhaustible treasures of this great and timeless wisdom.

Our ancient sages always kept the welfare of society above everything else. The great Puranic sage Dadhichi sacrificed his life to ensure that society remained on the path of righteousness. 

Sri Vishveshatirtha Swamiji is a noble soul in this glorious tradition. He was a role-model for those engaged in devoted social service. He always rushed to the help of the needy and poor during natural calamities. 

Sri Swamiji was one of the first to rush to the help of the people when a cyclonic storm struck the Hamsaladeevi area of Andhra Pradesh. He built 150 houses for the people who had suffered huge losses. 

Again when an earthquake struck the Latur region of Maharashtra in 1993, he was among the first to rush to their help. Similarly, he helped resettle those affected by the Tsunami in the Cuddalore region of Tamil Nadu.

During periods of drought, Sri Swamijiused to open free meal centres in many areas. To say in one word, He saw divinity in every human being and tried to serve the needy selflessly.

Sri Pejavara Swamiji was a progressive visionary. He was among the first spiritual leaders in modern India to consider Dalits as an integral part of Hindu society. He walked into the Dalit colonies in Malleshwaram, Bengaluru, in 1970. Before that he had visited similar Harijanakeri at Ooty in Tamilnadu.

Swamiji’s name is synonymous with service to the scheduled castes and tribes in India and he worked hard to bring them into the mainstream of national life. 

I appeal to everyone to follow the path shown by Sri Swamiji and work towards building a castless society in India.

Yet another area of major contribution by His Holiness Sri Sri Vishveshatirtha Swamiji was in the field of Sanskrit. He encouraged academic research in Sanskrit, philosophy and religion. He was one of the pioneers who promoted Sanskrit in this part of country.

This emphasis on Sanskrit is very important to preserve our cultural and shared values.

This Poornapragna Vidyapeetha, a Sanskrit  Spiritual Pathashala was established by him.  This is one of the first Sanskrit traditional Gurukula Education Centres of free India.

I hope that this Gurukula will take forward the great Indian tradition of learning through Guru – Shishya Parampara. 

I hope all disciples passing out from here will follow and spread the message and teachings of Sri Vishveshatirtha Swamiji.

I wish you all the very best and again bow my head in the memory the Great Swamiji.

Thank You.

Jai Hind.”

                Greetings to all! 

 

This is the first session of 2020. This is also the first session of this decade. We must strive to turn this session into a strong foundation for a bright future of this decade. Today, the Hon'ble President will address the Parliament and tomorrow this year's budget will also be presented. Let this session focus upon maximum possible economic issues and the way by which India can take advantage of the global economic scenario. Strengthening its economic activities, India should get the maximum benefits of the global conditions. Our government has been identified with the empowerment of the oppressed, the exploited, the deprived classes and women. We will be focussing upon the same in this decade too. And I would like to have a much wider and a better discussion on the economic issues and empowerment of people in both the Houses. And the quality of our discussion must become more enriched over the days. With this belief, I thank you all very much. Namaskar!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today attended the National Cadet Corps Rally in Delhi today. At the rally, Prime Minister inspected the Guard of Honour and reviewed the March Past by the various NCC contingents and also from Cadets from other friendly and neighbouring countries.

Bodo & Bru-Reang Agreement

Speaking on the development efforts of the North East, the Prime Minister said that earlier this region was neglected and battling extremism, innocents died in violence. He added that unprecedented plans for the development of the North East was initiated by this Government on the one hand, and on the other hand dialogue was initiated with all stakeholders with a very open mind and an open heart. The Bodo agreement is the result of this. This is the thinking of young India.

हमने एक तरफ नॉर्थ ईस्ट के विकास के लिए अभूतपूर्व योजनाओं की शुरुआत की और दूसरी तरफ बहुत ही खुले मन और खुले दिल के साथ सभी Stakeholders के साथ बातचीत शुरू की। बोडो समझौता आज इसी का परिणाम है: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 28 ஜனவரி, 2020



After the Bru – Reang Agreement between the Mizoram and Tripura, the 23-year-old problem involving the Bru tribes has been resolved. This is the thinking of young India. We are advancing the country by taking everyone along, developing everyone, gaining everyone's trust.

यही तो युवा भारत की सोच है। सबका साथ लेकर, सबका विकास करते हुए, सबका विश्वास हासिल करते हुए देश को हम आगे बढ़ा रहे हैं: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 28 ஜனவரி, 2020



Citizenship Amendment Act

Prime Minister said that it is necessary for the youth of the country, to know the truth about the Citizenship Amendment Act. Since independence, independent India has promised Hindus-Sikhs and other minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan that they can come to India if they need to. He promised that India stands with them. He added that this was also the wish of Gandhiji, this was also the spirit of the Nehru-Liaquat agreement in 1950. “In these countries, people who were tortured because of their faith, it is the responsibility of India to give them asylum, give them citizenship of India. But thousands of such people were turned away.”, the PM said. “In order to stop the historical injustice done to such people, today our government has brought Citizenship Amendment Act, giving citizenship of India to such people to fulfill the old promise of India” the PM said.

Prime Minister said that many people left India at the time of Partition but asserted their rights over the properties here. Despite the right of India on these assets worth millions of crores, Enemy Property was kept in abeyance for decades, he added. He said that those who opposed the Enemy Property law are the same people who have now come out to oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Indo Bangladesh border dispute

Prime Minister mentioned that there was no concrete initiative to resolve the dispute in the border areas of India and Bangladesh. He said that the infiltration will not stop till the border remains disputed.  Keep the dispute unresolved, gives the intruders an open path, keep running your politics.

He said that this government settled the border dispute with Bangladesh by listening to each other, understanding each other and finding a solution in which both countries agreed. He was satisfied that not only the border dispute has been resolved today, but also the relations between India and Bangladesh are at historical high today and both the countries are fighting poverty together.

Kartarpur Corridor

Prime Minister said that Partition took Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib away from us, making it a part of Pakistan. Kartarpur was the land of Guru Nanak. The faith of crores of countrymen was associated with that holy place, he added. He said that for decades, Sikh devotees were waiting for the opportunity to reach Kartarpur easily, and to have a glimpse of Guru Bhoomi. This was achieved by constructing Kartarpur corridor by this Government.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said Young India is not willing to procrastinate issues and is willing to combat separatism and terrorism.He was addressing the NCC Rally in Delhi today.

Urging the country to develop a youthful mindset and zest, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the problem of Jammu & Kashmir had been persisting for decades.

“The Problem of Jammu & Kashmir was persisting ever since the country attained its independence. What has been done for the solving the problem? “, he said.

He said, “About 3 to 4 families and political parties were not only interested in finding solution of the problem but also in keeping the issue unsolved”

“the result of this was that Kashmir got destroyed by continued terrorism in which thousands of innocents were killed”

“Government was made to stand as a mute spectator as lakhs of people were evicted from their homes in the state”, he said.

Referring to the Article 370, Prime Minister said it was meant to be a temporary arrangement but that continued for 7 decades owing to the vote bank politics of some political parties.

“Kashmir is the crown of the country and to pull it out of its turmoil is our responsibility”, he said.

Prime Minister also said that abrogation of Article 370 was aimed at solving long standing problem in Jammu and Kashmir.

Surgical Strikes and Air Strikes to Combat Terror

He said, “Our neighbour fought three wars with us but our forces defeated it in all the wars. Now it is fighting proxy-war with us and thousands of ourcitizens are being killed”.

“But what was the thinking on this issue before. It was being looked at as a Law & Order problem”, he said.

Prime Minister said the issue was kept to linger on and the security forces were never given a chance to act.

“Today India is progressing with a  youthful thinking and mindset and hence it was able to launch surgical strike, air strike and directly attack the terror camps”.

Prime Minister said the result of these actions is that today there is an all-round peace in the country and that terrorism has reduced considerably.

आज युवा सोच है, युवा मन के साथ देश आगे बढ़ रहा है, इसलिए वो सर्जिकल स्ट्राइक करता है, एयर स्ट्राइक करता है और आतंक के सरपरस्तों को उनके घर में जाकर सबक सिखाता है: PM @narendramodipic.twitter.com/Scm7kxlY8d— PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 28, 2020

National War Memorial:

Prime Minister said that some in the country did not want a memorial for martyrs of the country.

“Instead of boosting the morale of the security forces, there was an effort to hurt the pride of the forces”, he said.

He said that following the wishes of the young India, today a National War Memorial and National Police Memorial were built in Delhi.

आपकी युवा सोच, आपका युवा मन जो चाहता है, वही हमारी सरकार ने किया। आज दिल्ली में नेशनल वॉर मेमोरियल भी है और नेशनल पुलिस मेमोरियल भी: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 28, 2020

Chief of Defence Staff

Prime Minster said that all over the world armed forces are undergoing a transformation and there is a greater emphasis on the coordination of the Army, Navy & the Airforce.

In this direction there was a demand for a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) for many decades but unfortunately the indecisiveness prevailed, he said.

He said drawing the inspiration from a youthful thinking and mindset, the Government has appointed a CDS.

“The creation of the post of CDS and appointing the new CDS have been done by our Government”, he said.

Induction of Rafale – Next Generation Fighter Plane

On the issue of modernisation and technical upgradation of armed forces, Prime Minister said that anyone who loves the country would want his nation’s security forces to be modern and upgraded.

But he lamented that even after 30 years the Indian Airforce could not acquire a single Next Generation Fight Plane.

“Our aircraft were old and accident prone, martyring our fighter pilots”, he said.

“We could complete that task which was pending for over 3 decades. Today I am happy that after three decades of waiting, Indian Air Force could get the Next Generation Fighter Plane – Rafale”, he said.

Delighted to be at the NCC Rally. Watch. https://t.co/kg1oedPscd— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) January 28, 2020

                My colleagues in cabinet Shri RajnathSinghji, Shripad Yesso Naikji, Chief of Defence Staff General BipinRawatji,  senior officials of three armed services, Defence Secretary, Nation Cadet Corps Director General, guests from our friendly countries and my young friends from NCC who are here from different parts of the country,

First of all, I congratulate all of you for this programme.

Your excellent performance in the Republic Day Parade and your other activities and your achievements, be it in the fields of social service or sports, are commendable.

I congratulate and extend my best wishes to the friends who have been awarded. Several cadets from our neighbouring and friendly countries under the Youth Exchange Programme are also present here. I greet them as well. 

Friends,

NCC is a powerful organization in strengthening discipline, determination and devotion towards the country among the youths. These sentiments are directly linkedto the development of the country.

Nobody can stop the rapid development of a country if there is discipline, strong willpower, loyalty and passion among the youths.

Friends,

Today, India is known as a young country in the world. More than 65 percent of the people are below 35 years of age.

We are proud that the country is young, but it should be our responsibility to ensure the country’s line of thinking as youthful.

What does youthful thinking mean?

Those who are weary are neither capable of thinking nor have the intention to do something for the country. Have you noticed what kind of things do they do?

Let’s adjust, as it is!!!

Take  outtime somehow, right now!!!

We’ll see it in future!!!

What’s the hurry, just delay it, we’ll see it tomorrow!!!

Friends,

Tomorrow never comes for those who believe in this tendency.

These people look for self-interest only.

You will find these types of people at most places.

Today’s young India, the youth of India are not prepared to accept this tendency. He is squirming how things can move in the same fashion years after independence. How long will we carry on with our shortcomings?

He goes abroad, sees the world and then he finds decades-old problems in India.

He is not ready to fall victim to these problems.

He wants to change the country, to change the conditions.

And therefore he has decided, Boss, no more procastination. Need to take things head on.

This is the thought of the youth, this is the young mind, and this is the young India.

The same young India is saying that it should be our top priority to free the country of the baggage of the past, the same young India is saying that the present of the country should be reformed and there should be rapid development by strengthening its foundation. And the same young India is saying that each decision of the country should ensure better future for the coming generations.

We will have to work together in keeping with our challenges of the past, the needs of the present and aspirations of the future.

Friends,

You slog so much after joining the NCC. Whenever the call is made, you come. You spend hours in drill practice while also studying simultaneously. You have this passion that we will study and will do something for the country.

And what is the situation you get from outside?

There is a terrorist attack somewhere and several innocent people are killed, or several jawans die after Naxalites blow up a tunnel. Sometimes separatists give speeches, spew venom against India or sometimes insult the Tricolour. We are not prepared to accept this situation. The young India is not prepared. The New India is not prepared.

Friends,

Sometimes, if some disease does not get cured for a long time, it becomes part of the body. The same thing has happened with our nation also. The nation has been weakened by so many such diseases that it spends most of its energy fighting them. How long would it have continued like this? And for how many years more could we carry on with these diseases? And for how many years more could we continue to procrastinate?

Think about it,

The problem of Kashmir has been there since the country became independent. What was doneto find a solution to the problem? Three-four families and three-four parties emphasized on festering andkeeping alive this problem rather than finding a solution.

What was the outcome? Kashmir was ruined by terrorism and thousands of innocent people were killed at the hands of the terrorists.

Can you imagine lakhs of residents of that place being told to leave within a night and the government could not do anything?

This was the thought which only boosted the morale of the terrorists. The plan was to weaken the government and the administration.

Could we have allowed the situation to remain as it is in Kashmir?

Friends,

Article 370 was imposed in Jammu-Kashmir as a temporary step. The Constitution also says that it is temporary.  But decades passed and nobody showed the courage to remove what was temporary in the Constitution.

Reason was the same and so was the approach. Self-interest of one’s political party and its own vote-bank.

Could we have handed over such an India to the youth of our country where terrorism would prosper in Kashmir, innocents would die, the Tricolour would continue to be disrespected and the government would simply watch the situation?No.

Kashmir is India’s jewel in the crown. It was our responsibility to free Kashmir and its people from decades-old problems and we have done it.

Friends,

We know that our neighbouringcountry has lost three wars against us. It does not take more than 7-10 days for our forces to defeat them. For decades, it has been fighting a proxy war against India. Thousands of Indian nationals have died in this proxy war.

But what was the approach earlier?  They used to think that terrorism, terrorist attacks, bomb blasts were law and order problem!

It is because of this approach that bomb blasts continued, people gotkilled in terrorist attacks and the Goddess Mother left bloodied and battered.

Lots of discussions happened, many a speeches were given, but when our forces asked for action, they were denied.

It is the thought of the youth, the country is moving ahead with young mind, therefore, it carries out surgical strikes, air strikes and teaches lesson to the promoters of terrorism at their own backyards.

You yourself are witnessing the outcome.

Today, peace has been established not only in Jammu-Kashmir but in other parts of the country. Secessionism and terrorism have been largely confined.

Friends,

You are fully aware of the approach and the treatment towards the North-East in the past. 

People’s expectations and aspirations were neglected for decades.

Not only its people, but their problems, their challenges were left unattended.

Several regions there were affected by extremism for over 5-6 decades. Several extremist organizations cropped over due to their demands. These organizations had no faith in democracy. They believed that violence was the only way out.

Thousands of innocent people and security personnel died in this violence.

Could we have allowed the North-East to fend for itself? Could we have turned away from the problems of our brothers and sisters?

This is not our ethos; this is not our working culture.

There is important news in newspapers in regard to the North-East. You must have seen in the media. A historic agreement has been finalized on the problem of Bodos.

I would request you to study and research about such regions in the country, particularly Assam. Then you will realize what the people of the North-East have gone through. But no such initiative was taken to change the situation.

Could we have allowed the situation to continue like this?

No. Never.

On the one hand, we initiated several projects for the development of the North-East, on the other; we opened talks with all the stakeholders with an open mind. Bodo Agreement is the result of such efforts.

 

An agreement between Mizoram and Tripura over Brutribals in the recent past is also result of this. The agreement has led to the resolution of the 23-year-old issue of Brutribals.

This is the thinking of the young India. We are taking the country forward with the cooperation, development and trust of all.

Friends,

Which citizen of this country would not like our army to be modern and powerful? Who would not like to have the modern war facilities?

This is what every patriotic would want.

Can you imagine that no next generation fighter plane was commissioned in our country’s air force for more than 30 years?

The old aircraft used to meet with accidents, our fighter pilots continued to be martyred, but the people who had the responsibility to buy new aircraft were not concerned.

Could we have allowed this to happen? Could we let the airforce weaken?

No.

We started what was in limbo for the last three decades. I am satisfied that the country has got the next generation fighter plane – Rafale after more than three decades of wait. Very soon it will soar in the skies.

Friends,

You are in uniform. You can relate it more that the uniform brings along with it duties.  It is in regard to this duty that makes our jawan take up cudgels on the border, inside the country, against terrorists and Naxalites.

Just think, if he does not have a bulletproof jacket, what will happen?

But we had such governments and people who had problem with providing bulletproof jackets to our jawans. The jawans have been asking for bulletproof jackets since 2009, but those people in power did not pay any heed.

Could my jawan continue to fall prey to bullets of terrorists and Naxalites?

He has vowed to sacrifice his life for the country, but his life is more precious than us.

And therefore, our government not only ordered purchase of adequate bulletproof jackets for jawans, but the country is now moving to export bulletproof jackets to other countries as well.

Friends,

There must be several cadets amongst you whose family member would be in the army. When you meet somebody, you say this with pride that my father, or uncle, or brother, or sister is in army.

We have an instinct sense of glory towards the army jawans. The feeling of respect comes out automatically for them because of their services towards the country.  But, the previous governments could not meet their 40-year-old demand of one rank one pension, and I repeat their 40-year-old demand of one rank one pension.

This is our government which fulfilled the 40-year-old demand by implementing the one rank one pension.

Friends,

Our jawans at the border not only protect the country’s borders and people, but also protect the honour of the country. Honour is the first recognition of an independent country. There has been a clamourfor the National War Memorial for our brave soldiers, who are protecting the honour of the country, since Independence. Similarly, there has been a demand for a police memorial for the last several decades for the martyred police personnel.

Can one imagine that one has to wait for this for 50-60 years?

What was this approach, what was the thought process, which path they were taking the country to?

Some people strived to commit the sin of ignoring India’s martyrs.

Rather than boosting the morale and self-respect of our security personnel, their self-respect was dented.

Will the NCC cadet who is sitting here endorse this?

Our government has done what the youth wants. Today there is National War Memorial and National Police Memorial alsoin Delhi.

Friends,

Today, military systems are changing at different levels all over the world. We all know that war is no longer wonby mounting on elephants or horses. In the modern warfare, our army, navy and airforce have to move forward in a very coordinated way.

For several years, there was an ongoing debate for the appointment of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) to strengthen synergy and coordination amongst the three forces.

But sadly, there used to be only debates, files used to rotate from one table to another, and nobody took the decision.

The approach was same – what’s the use, let it be!!!

Friends,

Our government has constituted the Department of Military Affairs, CDS and its appointment.

It is with the same approach of the youth who say don’t procrastinate, take action.

And keep in mind that if one plus one plus one is three then it becomes 111 after the appointment of the CDS.

Friends,

Can you imagine that any country was letting its own water go waste? But it was happening in India. India’s farmer was upset due to water scarcity and the country’s water was flowing to Pakistan. Nobody had the courage to make available this water to the Indian farmer. We decided to stop the water flowing to Pakistan and the work is progressing rapidly.  The water which belonged to India will remain in India.

Friends,

When the country became independent, the partition happened with whose counsel, with whose interests? Those who took charge of the independent India agreed to the partition. I don’t want to go in detail.

You will know the truth if you read good books, if you study the works of unbiased historians. Today, the youth must know the truth about the disinformation and opposition towards the Citizenship Amendment Act. 

Friends,

Soon after independence, Independent India had promised to the Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities living in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan that they could return to India if they felt so. India will stand by them.

This was also the desire of Gandhiji, this was the sentiment of the Nehru-Liaquatagreement in 1950. It was the duty of India to provide asylum and citizenship of India to those who were undergoing atrocities due to their faith in these countries.But the issue was brushed aside.

At a time when our government has introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act to provide India’s citizenship to these people to stop the historic injustice against them and fulfill the old promises, then some political parties are competing to retain their vote bank. 

For whose interests are these people working?

Why can’t they see the atrocities being committed against the minorities in Pakistan?

Why are they hell-bent to brush aside the torture, rape and abduction of these daughters in Pakistan?

Friends, some among them are pretending to become the voice of the oppressed. These are the same people who could not see the atrocities against the oppressed. These people tend to forget that those who have escaped to India due to religious atrocities in Pakistan are the oppressed.

Friends,

Some time ago, Pakistan army had published an advertisement for the appointment of sanitation staff. Do you know what was written in those advertisements?

It was written only non-Muslims could apply for sanitation staff. This advertisement was meant for whom. It was meant for our oppressed brothers and sisters. They are being looked down upon in Pakistan. This is their condition.

Friends,

Many people left India during the Partition. But they used to stake their claims to the properties left behind.

Despite India being the rightful claimant of these properties which stood in the middle of the cities and worth several lakhs of crores rupees, it was of no use to the country. The Enemy Property Bill remained suspended for several decades. We had to fight tooth and nail to get it passed when we brought it to Parliament for its implementation.

I will ask again – on whose interests was it done?

Those who are opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act are the same people who were protesting against the Enemy Property law.

Friends,

There was an ongoing border dispute between the then East Pakistan and now Bangladesh since the Partition. No substantial initiative was taken to resolve this dispute.

How can infiltration be stopped if the border remains disputed?

Keep the dispute unresolved for your personal interest, make way for the infiltrators, play your own politics, all these things were going on in our country.

This is our government which resolved the border dispute with Bangladesh. We two friendly countries, sat together, heard each other, understood each other and found a resolution which should be acceptable to both the countries. I am satisfied that not only the border dispute has been resolved, but the relationship between India and Bangladesh are at historic level. Both of us are fighting together against the poverty.

Friends,

A line was drawn on a paper during the Partition. The country was partitioned. The line drawn on a paper had isolated us from GurudwaraKartarpur Sahib, which was made part of Pakistan.

Kartarpur was the land of Guru Nanak. The faith of crores of countrymen was associated with that sacred place. Why was it disowned? When Pakistan’s 90,000 soldiers were taken as prisoners, it could have been said then that at least return Kartarpur Sahib.

But, this was not even done. For decades, Sikh devotees were waiting for an opportunity to visit Kartarpur Sahib easily so that they could pay their obeisance to the land of Guru. Our government also did this by constructing Kartarpur corridor.

Friends,

If the Ram Janambhoomi case was dragging in courts, it was because of these people who thought – let the important issues remain unresolved and divert the attention of the people. These people used to make rounds of the court so that the hearing could be deferred or the court could not deliver its judgment. The country has seen all what methods were adopted. Our government exposed their designs, cleared the roadblocks being put up by those people, and today a judgment has also come in this important and sensitive case.

Friends,

The country has seen and is witness to the real face of the people who were communalizing our government’s decisions to resolve the decades-old problems.

I will reiterate – the country is watching and understanding. It is quiet, but understanding everything. The country has realized how these people spread lies for decades only for vote bank.

People occupying different positions in the society have been completely exposed. Everyday, their statements are exposing them and their philosophy.

These people have always kept self-interests above the interests of the country. These people did not let resolve problems for decades for their vote bank politics.

Friends,

The Supreme Court had in 1985-86, several years before you were born, announced a historic judgment by providing rights to Muslim women which were being enjoyed by other sisters and daughters.  But these people turned down the Supreme Court judgment. Are they not culprits for making the lives of thousands and lakhs of Muslim sisters and daughters hell due to Triple Talaq. Yes, they are.

It is because of the appeasement politics that Muslim sisters and daughters could not be freed from the fear of Triple Talaq. While several Muslims countries in the world had banned Triple Talaq, these people did not do here in India.

The approach was same – neither will we change, nor will we let others change.

Therefore, the country has replaced them. This is our government which has made a law against the Triple Talaq and has provided new rights to Muslim women.

Friends,

Lakhs of refugees were settled in Delhi after the independence, in the national capital where this programme is being held. As time passed by, lakhs of several others came to Delhi and got settled. For decades, the people living in over 1700 colonies did not get the property rights. Though it was their own house, but not in the eyes of laws. More than 40 lakh people were demanding that they be given their property rights.

But for decades, no attention was paid to their demand. When our government tried, attempts were made to put hurdles.

This is the thinking of the young India, New India which removed the biggest worry of the lives of Delhi’s 40 lakh people. The decision of the government will benefit Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians.

Friends,

Every citizen is important to us and we are moving ahead with this approach. As I mentioned earlier, the Bru-Reangtribals of Assam were left to fend for themselves. Our government has freed them from their biggest worry. These people escaped from Mizoram to take shelter in Tripura. For years, they were living like refugees. They had no place to live and there was no future for their children.

The previous governments were avoiding their problems. We brought together all and found a resolution. The government plans to spend 600 crore rupees to ease the lives of Bru-Reang tribes people in the coming years.

Friends,

Every young man, who is sitting here, wants end of corruption in the country. Corruption has wiped out the resources of our country like termites. It has made the rich richer and the poor poorer. Once the country’s Prime Minister had said if the central government sent one rupee to the poor, he got only 15 paise. This was the reality. What was done to change the situation? Only formalities – only pretense! No honest effort was made against corruption.

Our government has reined in corruption to a large extent through Jan DhanAadhaarand with the help of mobile phones and modern technology. Our government has succeeded in preventing more than 1,70,000 crore rupees from going into wrong hands.

Friends,

A law was made in the country against benami properties in 1988. The country’s parliament had passed it. But the law was not implemented for 28 years. The law against benami properties was consigned to the trash basket by these very people.

This is our government which not only implemented the benami properties law but has confiscated illegal properties worth thousands of crores rupees under this law.

I want to ask you one more question,because, you will be shocked to know the answer.

Can 400-500 people be accommodated in the kitchen of your house?

No !!!

Ok, tell me, can 2,000-3,000 people be accommodated in a kitchen?

No !!!

I also know it. But earlier, it was happening on the papers in the country. 400-500 companies were being run from the space of a kitchen. There used to be several employees of these companies on the papers.

What did these companies do? Transfer of black money from here and there. This was their modus operandi. 

Our government has closed down over 3.5 lakh such suspected shell companies.

This could have been done earlier. But intention was not there, the thinking of young India was not there.

We want to resolve the problems and do not want to drag them.

Our government has been implementing years-long demands of the people, be it the GST, or the decision to provide reservation to the poor or the law of execution in heinous crimes of rape.

Friends,

We were getting used to live with the decades old problems for the last 50 years of the 20th century and 15-20 years of the 21st century.

This situation is not acceptable for any country. We the people of India can’t let this happen. This is our duty to free the country of these problems in our life time.

We will do injustice to the future of the country if we entwine the new generations with these problems. We can’t let this happen.

And therefore, I am facing all the political theatrics for the coming generations and for the well being of the youths of the country.

I am trying to expose all the conspiracies of these people so that the country could become successful. I am facing all the criticism and abuses so that our future generations don’t have to endure this.

I am prepared to endure all the abuses, criticism and atrocities, but not to keep the country burdened with these conditions.

These days, these people are spreading propaganda through people like them in foreign media that Modi’s popularity has taken a hit due to the decisions taken by my government. Modi is not born for all these. They have not been able to understand India which is changing. 

I have faced their pressures for ages. I am aware of their real worth more than they know about themselves. Therefore, these people should not have any illusion.

Friends,

How can a country shackled in several problems march ahead?

We are finding solutions to the problems and are also breaking the shackles.

We have to strengthen this country; we have to take it to new highs of development.

We have to free the country of these problems for ever by the time we celebrate the 75th independence anniversary in 2022.

This liberation from the problems that have been going on since independence will empower the new India in this decade.

Once the country will rid itself of old problems, it’s potential will also blossom.

India’s energy will be utilized where it should be.

The young India has to play a very large role in the fourth industrial revolution. We have to take our economy to new highs.

Together, we have to make a self-reliant, powerful, prosperous and safe India.

Friends,

The year 2022 and this decade is a great opportunity. Its biggest strength is our young energy. This energy has taken care of the country and the same energy will take care of this decade as well.

So, let us march on the path of duty.

New milestones for the nation building are awaiting us after the solution of the problems.

We will reach these milestones together. With this confidence, I conclude.

I have taken your precious time.

Once again, many many thanks.

Bharat Mata kiJai !!!

Jai Hind !!!

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today attended the National Cadet Corps Rally in Delhi today.

At the rally, Prime Minister inspected the Guard of Honour and reviewed the March Past by the various NCC contingents and also from Cadets from other friendly and neighbouring countries. 



Along with a cultural performance, NCC cadets also presented before the Prime Minister their capabilities in fields such as adventure sports, music and performance arts. Prime Minister distributed awards for the meritorious NCC cadets.

Addressing the gathering, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said that NCC provides a good platform to strengthen the spirit of Discipline, Determination and Devotion of the youth towards the country. He said such values will help in the development of the country.

NCC, देश की युवाशक्ति में Discipline, Determination और देश के प्रति Devotion की भावना को मजबूत करने का बहुत सशक्त मंच है। ये भावनाएं देश के Development के साथ सीधी-सीधी जुड़ी हैं: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 28 January 2020




Prime Minister termed India as one of the youthful countries in the world as more than 65% of its population is below 35 years of age. “We are proud of this fact, but it should also be our responsibility to think young,'' he said. Prime Minister said this would mean that there would be no place of procrastinating and finding immediate solutions to any issue. “This is what a young mind craves for and this what a young India is”, he said.

आज विश्व में हमारे देश की पहचान, युवा देश के रूप में है। देश के 65 परसेंट से ज्यादा लोग 35 वर्ष से कम उम्र के हैं। देश युवा है, इसका हमें गर्व है लेकिन देश की सोच युवा हो, ये हमारा दायित्व होना चाहिए: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 28 January 2020



He said, “We should while facing the challenges of the past and taking care of the necessities of the present, we should work towards our aspirations of the future”. He said India is today going ahead with a youthful zest and mind. “Today India has a youthful mindset and heart, and that’s the reason why it conducts surgical strikes, air strikes and directly attacks terror camps”. He said youthful mindset wants to progress by taking everyone along and not leaving anyone behind. “It is with this spirit that we signed the Bodo Agreement, where in all the stakeholders were consulted and the agreement was signed”

आज युवा सोच है, युवा मन के साथ देश आगे बढ़ रहा है, इसलिए वो सर्जिकल स्ट्राइक करता है, एयर स्ट्राइक करता है और आतंक के सरपरस्तों को उनके घर में जाकर सबक सिखाता है: PM @narendramodi pic.twitter.com/Scm7kxlY8d— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 28 January 2020



Speaking on the development efforts of the North East PM highlighted that along with the development of the North East region, started negotiations with all stakeholders have been started with a very open mind and an open heart. Bodo agreement today is the result of this. “This is the thinking of young India. We are taking the country forward by taking everyone along, developing everyone, gaining everyone's trust,” he said. 

हमने एक तरफ नॉर्थ ईस्ट के विकास के लिए अभूतपूर्व योजनाओं की शुरुआत की और दूसरी तरफ बहुत ही खुले मन और खुले दिल के साथ सभी Stakeholders के साथ बातचीत शुरू की। बोडो समझौता आज इसी का परिणाम है: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 28 January 2020

                Gujarat’s popular Chief Minister Shri Vijay Rupani, my colleagues in Union cabinet Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, Shri Parshottam Rupala, Gujarat’s Agriculture Minister Shri R.C. Faldu, dignitaries on the podium, scientists from India and across the world and my dear farmer sisters and brothers.

Welcome to the abode and temple of Mahatma.

I have been told that scientists from several countries are participating in the Global Potato Conclave. They have been joined by thousands of my farmer friends and other stakeholders. In the next three days, all of you are going to discuss and find solution to the important issues regarding the global demand of food and nutrition. 

The most important aspect of this conclave is that three events -- Potato Conference, Agri Expo and Potato Field Day – are happening simultaneously here. I have been told that about 6,000 farmers are going to visit the farms of Gujarat on the Field Day. I think that it itself is a very commendable effort.

Friends, the good thing is that this year’s Potato Conclave has been happening away from Delhi and in the midst of thousands of potato growers. The choice of Gujarat as a conclave is also important because this state tops the rest of the states in potato productivity. 

Friends,

In the last two decades, Gujarat has emerged as a hub of potato production and export. While there has been around 20 percent increase in the country’s potato production in the last 10-11 years, Gujarat has reported an increase of 170 percent.

The policy decisions along with modern and adequate irrigation facilities in the last two decades have contributed to the increase in the quantity and quality of potato. It is because of better policy decisions that Gujarat has not only sizable potato processing units but most of the potato exporters are also based in Gujarat. There is a huge and modern network of cold storage in Gujarat. Most of them are equipped with world class facilities.

Besides, programmes like Sujalam-Sufalam and Sauni Plan have made irrigation possible in those areas of Gujarat which used to be affected by drought.

A huge tract of Gujarat has come under irrigation due to Sardar Sarovar Dam. To develop a wide network of canals in a short span is a great achievement in itself.

Improvements are being made in the scientific and technological approaches towards irrigation and being implemented. The per drop more crop mantra is being effectively implemented by focusing on micro irrigation and promoting drip or sprinkler irrigation. 

Friends,

Gujarat’s experiments in the last five years have been replicated in the country as well. We have made a steady progress and achieved significantly in our mission towards doubling the income of farmers by 2022.  Several important steps are being taken. It is because of the combination of farmers’ efforts and government policies that today India is among the top three countries in the production of many cereals and other food items. At one point of time, we had a crisis of pulses. But the country’s farmers were determined and India scored a victory.

Friends,

In order to make farming more profitable, the government’s focus is to prepare a modern and wide network from fields to food processing and distribution centre. Thousands of crores of rupees will be spent on irrigation and farm-related infrastructure in the next five years.

Not only this, the central government has taken several steps to promote sectors involved in food processing. Efforts are being made at all levels, whether it is the 100 percent foreign direct investment in the sector or help being extended for value addition and value chain development through PM Kisan Sampada Scheme. Under this scheme, projects worth several hundred crore rupees have been completed in the country in a very short span of time.

Friends,

It is the endeavour of the government to reduce the cost of cultivation, reduce the cost of the farmer. The government’s PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi initiative has helped farmers meet their some of the expenses. So far, the scheme has benefited eight crore farmers. A new record has been created early this month by transferring 12,000 crore rupees to the bank accounts of six crore farmers.

Friends,

Our priority is to reduce the layers between farmers and consumers and the wastage of produce. In order to achieve this, traditional farming is being encouraged.

Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) are being promoted so that farmers have easy access to loans, technology and markets. It is the endeavour of the government to set up 10,000 new FPOs in the next five years. Not only this, a national agriculture market called e-NAM is becoming very popular among farmers.

Friends,

The government is also emphasizing to promote agro-technology based startups to create data base for farmers to help them with smart and pre-season agriculture. It will be of valuable help to farmers regarding the proper use of water, manure and pesticides. It will not only bring down the input costs but will ensure Indian farmers’ greater partnership in global market.

Friends,

The government efforts will bear fruits only when scientists and researchers find affordable solutions to make perishable vegetables more sustainable. Given the challenges of the coming decades, we will need to find solutions for productivity, affordability and fair price to farmers.  

We will need to prepare seeds which use less water and are also more nutritive and should have longer life and productivity. We should ensure that the cost of the seed is also low and the input cost associated with it is also not too high.

Your suggestions and solutions for better utilization of modern bio-technology, Artificial Intelligence, Block Chain, Drone Technology, etc will also be important.

Friends,

Given the usefulness of potatoes, time has come to prepare a new policy and research agenda to promote potato sub sector.  At the core of this policy and agenda should be the fight against hunger and poverty and global food security.

All of you are capable of doing this. It is because of your efforts that the situation which arose in Europe and America following the 19th century potato disease did not recur.

A huge and collective responsibility rests on your shoulders, be it farmers, businessmen, scientists, progressive traders, or those working in the field of food processing to ensure that nobody should remain hungry and malnourished in the 21st century. I am hopeful that you will have serious discussions in the next three days.

Once again, I am grateful to you for visiting India and Gujarat. I also thank the agriculture department for holding this summit away from Delhi. I can visualize the success of this programme as you plan to take people not only from our country but different parts of the world for direct interaction with farmers. Once again, I welcome you to Gujarat and hope you have comfortable stay here. I once again express my gratitude to you with a desire that you enjoy the wonderful hospitality of Gujarat, visit the places associated with Gandhiji, take memories of the Statue of Unity with you. Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.

Thank you.

                PM addressed the 3rd Global Potato Conclave at Gandhinagar, Gujarat through Video Conferencing today. The previous two Global Potato Conferences were organized during 1999, and 2008. The Conclave is being organized by Indian Potato Association (IPA) in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, and ICAR-Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla and International Potato Center (CIP), Lima, Peru.

Scientists around the world, potato farmers and other stakeholders have gathered for the Global Potato Conclave to discuss the important aspects related to food and nutrition demand in the next few days.

Addressing the Conclave, the Prime Minister said that the highlight of the 3rd  conclave is that Potato Conference, AgriExpo and Potato Field Day are all happening at the same time. He also said that it is a commendable effort that 6 thousand farmers are going on field visits on the Field Day.

 

The Prime Minister said that it is significant that the 3rd Global Potato Conclave is being held in Gujarat, the leading state in Potato production and productivity in the country. He said that while the area under potato cultivation increased by about 20% in India in the last eleven years, it has increased by about 170% in Gujarat during the same period.

 

The Prime Minister said that this is largely owing to the policy initiatives and decisions which lead to the State using modern methods of agriculture like sprinkler and drip irrigation for cultivation, along with the best cold storage facilities and linkages to the Food Processing Industry. He said today Gujarat has major Potato processing companies in the state and that most of the potato exporters are also based in Gujarat. These have led to the emergence of the state as a major potato hub in the country.

 

The Prime Minister said that his Government is taking rapid steps towards the goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2022. He added that as a result of the efforts of farmers and the combination of government policy, India is among the top 3 countries in the world in the production of many cereals and other food items. He also listed the steps taken by his Government to promote food processing industries at every level like opening the sector to 100% FDI, helping in value addition and value chain development through PM Kisan Sampada Yojana.

 

The Prime Minister also mentioned that earlier this month, a new record has also been created by transferring an amount of Rs. 12,000 crores to the bank accounts of 6 crore farmers through direct transfer. He also mentioned that the priority of his Government is to reduce middlemen and other layers between the farmer and the consumer. He said that the government's emphasis is also on promoting agricultural technology-based start ups so that farmers' databases and agri stacks needed for smart and precision agriculture can be used.

 

The Prime Minister urged the scientists to provide solutions to various issues in Agriculture through modern biotechnology, Artificial Intelligence, Block chain, Drone Technology. He said that the greatest responsibility of the scientific community and policy makers is to see that no one is left hungry or malnourished.

 

Background:

The 3rd Global Potato  Conclave will provide an opportunity to bring all stakeholders at one common platform so that all the issues are discussed and future plans are made involving everyone related to the potato sector. This will be a unique event to expose different stakeholders of the country to the frontiers of knowledge and innovations in potato research. This mega event has three major components; (i) The Potato Conference, (ii) The Agri Expo and (iii) Potato Field Day.

 

The Potato Conference will be held for 3 days during 28-30 January, 2020. It will have 10 themes out of which 8 themes are based on basic and applied research. The remaining two themes will have special emphasis on potato trade, value chain management and policy issues.

 

AgriExpo will be organized during 28 to 30 January, 2020, to showcase the status of potato-based industries and trade, processing, seed potato production, biotechnology, public-private partnership in technology transfer and farmers related products etc.

 

Potato Field Day will be organized on January 31, 2020. This will include demonstration of advancements in potato mechanization, potato varieties and latest technologies.

 

Major issues that are to crop up are Shortage of Planting Material, Supply Chains, Post-Harvest Losses, needs for enhanced processing, export and diversified utilisation and necessary policy support – viz for production and use of certified seed, for long distance transport and export promotion.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi hailed the historic Bodo Accord signed today and said the Accord will lead to transformative results for the Bodo people.

In a tweet Prime Minister said, “Ushering in a new dawn of peace, harmony and togetherness! Today is a very special day for India. The Accord with Bodo groups, which has been inked today will lead to transformative results for the Bodo people.

Bodo Accord inked today stands out for many reasons. It successfully brings together the leading stakeholders under one framework. Those who were previously associated with armed resistance groups will now be entering the mainstream and contributing to our nation’s progress.

The Accord with Bodo groups will further protect and popularise the unique culture of the Bodo people. They will get access to a wide range of development oriented initiatives. We are committed to doing everything possible to help the Bodo people realise their aspirations”.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi shall be addressing the 3rd Global Potato Conclave at Gandhinagar, Gujarat through remote video conferencing tomorrow i.e 28th of January 2020.

Prime Minister is expected to take an overall view of the achievements and opportunities in the area of potato research, trade and industry, and value chain management and set a roadmap for the decade.

The present conclave is the third in the series. In a gap of every ten years it is necessary to work out the achievements in potato sector and set a roadmap for forthcoming decade. In this direction, during last two decades two Global Potato Conferences were organized during 1999, and 2008.

The Conclave will provide an opportunity to bring all stakeholders at one common platform so that all the issues are discussed and future plans are made involving everyone related to the potato sector. This will be a unique event to expose different stakeholders of the country to the frontiers of knowledge and innovations in potato research.

Gujarat is one of the leading producers of Potato in the country.  In the last eleven years alone, while the area under potato in India, has increased by 19%, it has increased by about 170% in Gujarat (49.7 thousand ha in 2006-07 to 133 thousand ha in 2017-18). With a productivity of more than 30t/ha, Gujarat is holding the No. 1 position in India for last one decade. The State uses modern methods of agriculture like sprinkler and drip irrigation for cultivation.

The State also has the best of the cold storage facilities and linkages and is a hub for major potato processing industries in the country.

In addition most of the potato exporters are also based in Gujarat. These have led to emergence of the state as a major potato hub in the country.

In the light of this the 3rd Global Conclave is being held in Gujarat.

The Conclave is being organized by Indian Potato Association (IPA) in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, and ICAR-Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla and International Potato Center (CIP), Lima, Peru. 

This mega event has three major components; (i) The Potato Conference, (ii) The Agri Expo and (iii) Potato Field Day. 

The Potato Conference will be held for 3 days during 28-30 January, 2020. It will have 10 themes out of which 8 themes are based on basic and applied research. The remaining two themes will have special emphasis on potato trade, value chain management and policy issues. 

AgriExpo will be organized during 28 to 30 January, 2020, to showcase the status of potato-based industries and trade, processing, seed potato production, biotechnology, public-private partnership in technology transfer and farmers related products etc.

Potato Field Day will be organized on January 31, 2020. This will include demonstration of advancements in potato mechanization, potato varieties and latest technologies.

Major issues that are to crop up are Shortage of Planting Material, Supply Chains, Post-Harvest Losses, needs for enhanced processing, export and diversified utilisation and necessary policy support – viz for production and use of certified seed, for long distance transport and export promotion.

                In his Mann Ki Baat today Prime Minister congratulated the Government, the people of Assam and participants for successful conclusion of the 'Khelo India Games'. 

Prime Minister said, Khelo India games had around 6 thousand players from different states participating. 80 records were broken, and of these 80 records, 56 were broken by our daughters. He noted that in 2018, when 'Khelo India Games' were instituted, thirty-five hundred players took part, but in just three years the number of players has increased to more than 6 thousand, which translates to the fact that it has almost doubled. 

Prime Minister in Mann Ki Baat today shared inspiring stories of the participant children and their parents. One among those was the story of Yogananthan of Tamil Nadu. Prime Minister said, “Yogananthan makes beedis in Tamil Nadu, but his daughter Purnashree won everyone's heart by bagging the Gold Medal in Weight Lifting”.

He also mentioned about David who won a gold medal at the 200 meter Sprint event in cycling in Youth Games in Guwahati. David from Car-Nicobar had lost his parents while he was an infant. His uncle wanted him to become a footballer, and hence had named him after the famous footballer David Beckham. But young David was obsessed with cycling. He was selected under the 'Khelo India' scheme and today he has  created a new record in cycling.

He also shared the inspiring story of Kareena Shankta of Mumbai. Kareena competed in the 100 metre breast-stroke event in swimming, won the gold medal in the Under-17 category and also set a new national record. However there was a time for Kareena, a 10th standard student when she had to forego her training due to a knee injury. But Kareena and her mother did not lose courage and the result of that fortitude is evident in front of all of us today. 

Prime Minister said, “We all know that National Games is an arena, where players get a chance to display their passion besides becoming acquainted with the culture of other states. Therefore, we have decided to organize 'Khelo India University Games' every year on the pattern of 'Khelo India Youth Games'” .

Next month the first edition of 'Khelo India University Games' is being organized in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, Odisha from 22nd February to 1st March. And more than 3000 players have qualified for participating in these games.

Fit India

Prime Minister lauded the 'Fit India School' campaign for bringing positive results. He noted that more than 65,000 schools have obtained the 'Fit India School' certificates through online registration. He urged the rest of the schools in the country to integrate physical activity and sports with education and ensure that they become a 'fit school'.

                Jal Shakti Abhiyan  

     In Mann Ki Baat today Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said Jal Shakti Campaign is taking rapid, successful strides with the aid of public participation. He shared few extensive & innovative water conservation efforts under way, in every corner of the country. 

Mentioning about Jalore district in Rajasthan He said, “There, two historical step wells had turned into storehouses of garbage & dirty water. But one fine day, hundreds of people from Bhadraayun & Thanawala Panchayats took a resolve to rejuvenate them, under the Jal Shakti Campaign. Much before the rains, people immersed themselves in the task of cleaning out the accumulated filthy water, garbage and morass. For this campaign, some donated money; others their labour & sweat. As a result, these step wells have turned into their lifelines now”. 

Similarly Saraahi Lake in Barabanki Uttar Pradesh, was brought to life by the collective efforts of Villagers. Another example of Public participation is Village Suniyakot along the Almora-Haldwani Highway in Uttarakhand.  Here villagers took it upon themselves to ensure that water reached their village. People raised money, donated labour. A pipe was laid upto the village and a pumping station was set up. Thus decade old problem of water crisis was solved.

Prime Minister urged everyone to share their stories of such endeavours of water conservation and water harvesting by using #Jalshakti4India.

Jal Shakti Abhiyan - a campaign for water conservation and water security commenced last monsoon in July, 2019.  The campaign focussed on water stressed districts and blocks.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi discussed the ‘Gaganyaan’ Mission in his first Mann Ki Baat of the new year and the new decade.

He said as India celebrates its 75th year of Independence in 2022 the country has to fulfil “the pledge to take an Indian into the space through the ‘Gaganyaan’ mission.”

He said, “Gaganyaan mission will be a historic achievement in the field of science and technology for India in the 21st century. It will prove to be a milestone for New India.”

Prime Minister praised the four pilots of the Indian Airforce who have been selected as astronauts for the mission and their forthcoming training in Russia.

“These promising youngsters symbolise India's skill, talent, ability, courage and dreams. Our four friends are about to go to Russia in a few days for their training. I am confident that this would script another golden chapter in India-Russia friendship and cooperation.”

Prime Minister said that after their training for over a year, they would shoulder the responsibility of carrying the hopes and aspirations of the nation and soaring into space.

He said, “On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I congratulate these four youngsters and the Indian and Russian scientists and engineers associated with this mission.”

                In his first ever Mann Ki Baat of the new year and the new decade the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today said that Bru-Reang Agreement closes over two decade old refugee crisis providing succour and relief to over 34,000 refugees in Mizoram.

Explaining the problem in detail, Shri Modi said, “This problem pertains to the 90s. In 1997, ethnic tension forced the Bru-Reang tribe to leave Mizoram and take refuge in Tripura. These refugees were kept in temporary camps in Kanchanpur in North Tripura. It's painful that the Bru-Reang community lost a significant part of their life as refugees. Life in camps meant that they were deprived of all basic amenities. For 23 years – no home, no land, no medical treatment for their families, no education facilities for their kids.”

Prime Minister said that several Governments have found no cure to the problem and the pain of the refugees. He appreciated the faith of the refugees in the Indian Constitution.

He said it is their belief that today led to the historic agreement that was signed in Delhi this month. 

“It's a result of that belief that their life is on the threshold of a new dawn today. As per the agreement, the path to a dignified life has been opened for them. Finally the new decade of 2020, has brought a new ray of hope in the life of the Bru-Reang community”, he said.

Explaining the benefits of the agreement, the Prime Minister said, “Around 34000 Bru refugees will be rehabilitated in Tripura. Not just that, the government will provide an assistance of close to Rs.600 crores for their rehabilitation and all-round development. Each displaced family will be provided a plot of land. They will be assisted in construction of a house. In addition, rations will be provided to them. They will now be able to benefit from the public welfare schemes of the state and central governments.”

Prime Minister termed this agreement as special, as it symbolises the spirit of cooperative federalism.

 He said, “This agreement also epitomises the inherent compassion and sensitivity of Indian culture.”

Shed Violence – Return to Mainstream

Prime Minister said that violence cannot provide solutions to any problem. He praised the 644 Militants of 8 groups in Assam who surrendered their arms and decided to return to mainstream.

He said, “Assam, which hosted the grand 'Khelo India' games successfully, was witness to another great achievement. A few days ago, 644 militants pertaining to 8 different militant groups, surrendered with their weapons. Those who had strayed towards the path of violence, have expressed their faith in peace and decided to become a partner in the country's progress and return to the mainstream.”

He said similarly in Tripura more than 80 people left the path of violence and returned to the mainstream and that insurgency in the North-East has considerably reduced.

He said, “The biggest reason for that is that every issue of this region is being honestly and peacefully solved through dialogue.”

He urged those who are still on the path of violence to return to the mainstream.

“On the solemn occasion of Republic day, I would appeal to anyone in any part of the country, who's still seeking solutions to problems through violence and weapons, to return to the mainstream. They should have faith in their own capabilities and the capabilities of this country to resolve issues peacefully”, he said.

                        My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Today is the 26th of January. Heartiest greetings to you on the Festival of our Republic. This is our first meeting of minds in the year 2020, through ‘Mann Ki Baat’. This is the first such programme of the year; nay, of the decade. Friends, this time, it came across as appropriate to change the broadcast time of Mann Ki Baat, on account of the Republic Day Celebrations. And that is why I am reaching out to you this evening through Mann Ki Baat, having thought of a separate time slot. Friends, every day is a new day; weeks and months keep seeing change; years witness transformation, except for the enthusiasm and fervor of the people of India! And, of course, we are no less… we are certain to outdo ourselves. The spirit of ‘can do’, is emerging as a new resolve. The sentiment of contributing positively to the country & society is gaining strength, day by day. Friends, we have come together, once again, on the dais of Mann Ki Baat. This is to discuss newer subjects; to celebrate the latest achievements of our countrymen; in fact, to celebrate India. Mann Ki Baat has emerged as a fruitful, frank, effortless & organic platform for sharing, learning and growing together. Every month, thousands of people share their suggestions, their efforts, and their experiences thereby. And through the endeavour, we get a chance to discuss some extraordinary feats by people, which serve as a beacon of inspiration to society. 

        Somebody has succeeded in doing something – can we too achieve that! Can that particular venture be replicated to bring about a colossal transformation in the entire country? Can we establish that change into permanence, turning it into a simple, natural social habit? In a likewise quest to seek answers, the caravan of Mann Ki Baat progresses with a few appeals, some invocations and a lot of resolves to do something. For the past many years, we would have made varied resolves. Just as, ‘No to single use plastic’, buying Khadi or ‘local’, sanitation & cleanliness, respect & honour for the girl child, or emphasizing on the new aspect of ‘less cash economy’! Many a resolve such as these came into being on account of our conversations & chats through Mann Ki Baat. And, you have been the ones who strengthened that. 

        I have received a lovely letter, written by Shriman Shailesh from Bihar. In fact, he no longer stays in Bihar. He says, he stays in Delhi, working for an NGO. Shailesh writes, “Modi ji, you appeal to us on one point or the other, in every episode of Mann Ki Baat. I have implemented many of them in letter & spirit. This winter, I collected warm clothes from people, going home to home and distributed them to the needy. Taking a cue from Mann Ki Baat, I have embarked upon many initiatives. But gradually, I began forgetting… certain things started fading away. This new year, I have made a Charter pertaining to Mann Ki Baat, consisting of a list of all these, just the way people make resolutions at the onset of the New Year. Modi ji, this is my social resolution for this new year. I feel there are many little things that can usher in a big change. Can you inscribe your autograph on this Charter and arrange to send it back to me?” Well, Shailesh ji, heartiest congratulations and many good wishes to you. The Mann Ki Baat Charter in connection with your New Year resolution is very innovative. I shall certainly send it back to you, along with my best wishes inscribed. Friends, when I was glancing through this ‘Mann Ki Baat Charter’, I was taken aback at the magnitude of its contents… a multitude of hash tags. And, of course, we have striven together on myriad endeavours. There have been times when we tried to establish a stronger emotional connect with our soldiers through the campaign ‘Sandesh to Soldiers’; we have also catapulted sales of Khadi with ‘Khadi for Nation- Khadi for Fashion’. We internalized the Mantra of ‘buy local’. Through ‘Hum Fit toh India Fit’, we enhanced awareness, towards fitness. We turned sanitation into a mass movement, through the endeavours of ‘My clean India’ or ‘Statue Cleaning’. #‘No to Drugs’, #‘Bharat Ki Lakshmi’, #‘Self for Society’, #‘Stress free Exams’, #‘Suraksha- Bandhan’ #‘Digital Economy’, #‘Road Safety’…. Oh, the list is endless.

        Shailesh ji, you must have realized after going through this Mann Ki Baat Charter that the list is indeed long! Come, let us continue this journey. Do join any cause of your choice listed in the Mann Ki Baat Charter. Using the hashtag, proudly share your contribution with one & all. Try motivating friends & family. When every Indian takes a step forward, it results in India going ahead by a 130 crore steps. And that’s why, it is said “Charaivetee, charaivetee, charaivetee…” Keep walking, keep marching, keep advancing! Your endeavour should revolve around that Mantra.

        My dear countrymen, we touched upon the Mann Ki Baat Charter. The ethos of public participation, besides in the area of sanitation, is rising rapidly on another front… and that is water conservation. Quite a few extensive & innovative efforts are under way, in every corner of the country, for the sake of conserving water. It gives me joy to let you know that the Jal-Shakti Campaign that commenced last monsoon is taking rapid, successful strides with the aid of public participation. A large number of lakes & ponds have been built. And the best part is that in this campaign, people from all strata of society contributed wholeheartedly. Take for instance Jalore district in Rajasthan. There, two historical step wells had turned into storehouses of garbage & dirty water. But one fine day, hundreds of people from Bhadraayun & Thanawala Panchayats took a resolve to rejuvenate them, under the Jal Shakti Campaign. Much before the rains, people immersed themselves in the task of cleaning out the accumulated filthy water, garbage and morass. For this campaign, some donated money; others their labour & sweat. As a result, these step wells have turned into their lifelines now. A similar story comes across from Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh.           

        Here, the Saraahi Lake, spread across 43 hectares was on the verge of breathing its last. But the villagers, through the power of their collective resolve pumped life into it. They did not let any deterrent enter in the way of this mammoth mission. Villages joined hands, one after the other. They built a one meter high embankment along all the four sides of the lake. The lake now is brimming with water; the surroundings wake up to the melody of the chirping of birds.

        Village Suniyakot along the Almora-Haldwani highway in Uttarakhand has also emerged as a similar example of public participation. To tide over an acute water crisis, villagers took it upon themselves to ensure that water reached their village. There was no stopping to their resolve. People raised money among themselves. The plan was followed by collective donation of labour and from almost a kilometre away, a pipe was laid upto the village. A pumping station was set up. By and by, a two decade old agonizing problem came to an end. Whereas, a very innovative idea of harnessing a borewell for rainwater harvesting sprung up from Tamilnadu. The country is replete with innumerable such stories, of water conservation, lending more strength to the resolves of New India. Today the entire country is eager to hear similar accomplishments of our Jal Shakti champions. I urge you to share without fail, stories, photos & videos of such endeavours of water conservation and water harvesting undertaken by you or those around you using #Jalshakti4India. 

My dear countrymen and especially all my young friends, today, through the forum of 'Mann Ki Baat', I congratulate the Government and the people of Assam for being the excellent hosts of 'Khelo India'. Friends, on 22nd January, the third 'Khelo India Games' concluded in Guwahati. These games had around 6 thousand players from different states participating. You will be surprised to know that 80 records were broken during this grand sports festival. And I am proud that of these 80 records, 56 were broken by our daughters. These laurels have been recorded in the name of our daughters! I along with all the winners, congratulate all the participants. I also thank all the people, coaches and technical officers associated with 'Khelo India Games’ for organising them successfully. 

It is very pleasant for all of us to learn that the participation of athletes in 'Khelo India Games' is on the upsurge year after year. And this also tells you about the increasing inclination towards sports in our school children. I wish to tell all of you that in 2018, when 'Khelo India Games' were instituted, thirty-five hundred players took part, but in just three years the number of players has increased to more than 6 thousand, which translates to the fact that it has almost doubled. Not only this, in just three years, through 'Khelo India Games', thirty-two hundred gifted children have emerged on the sporting horizon! Many of these children grew up amidst dearth and poverty. The stories of the patience and determination of these children who participated in 'Khelo India Games' as well as their parents will inspire every Indian. Now take the example of Purnima Mandal of Guwahati, a sanitation worker in Guwahati Municipal Corporation! But whereas her daughter Malvika showed her mettle in football, one of her sons Sujit represented Assam in Kho-Kho, while the other son Pradeep did the same in hockey.

Somewhat similar is the story of Yogananthan of Tamil Nadu which fills you with great pride! Yogananthanmakesbeedis in Tamil Nadu, but his daughter Purnashree won everyone's heart by bagging the Gold Medal in Weight Lifting. If I now take the name of David Beckham, you will think whether I’m referring to the legendary International Footballer. But now we also have a David Beckham amidst us and he has won a gold medal at the Youth Games in Guwahati. That too in the 200-meter Sprint event in Cycling! You know, some time ago I had visited Andaman-Nicobar Islands! There was David, a denizen of Car-Nicobar who had lost his parents while he was an infant! His uncle wanted him to become a footballer, and hence had named him after the famous footballer. But young David was obsessed with cycling. He was selected under the 'Khelo India' scheme and today you can witness for yourself that he has created a new record in cycling.

Prashant Singh Kanhaiya of Bhiwani broke his own national record in the Pole vault event. Prashant, 19, hails from an agrarian family. You will be surprised to know that Prashant used to practice Pole vault on clay! After knowing this amazing fact, the Sports Department helped his coach to run the academy at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi and today Prashant is being coached there.

The never say die story of Kareena Shankta of Mumbai inspires everyone. Kareena competed in the 100 metre breast-stroke event in swimming, won the gold medal in the Under-17 category and also set a new national record. However there was a time for Kareena, a 10th standard student when she had to forego her training due to a knee injury. But Kareena and her mother did not lose courage and the result of that fortitude is evident in front of all of us today. I wish all the players a bright future. Along with this, I also, on behalf of all our countrymen, bow in honouring those parents, who did not permit poverty to become a hurdle for the future of their children. We all know that National Games is an arena, where players get a chance to display their passion besides becoming acquainted with the culture of other states. Therefore, we have decided to organize 'Khelo India University Games' every year on the pattern of 'Khelo India Youth Games'.

Friends, next month, the first edition of 'Khelo India University Games' is being organized in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, Odisha from 22nd February to 1st March. And more than 3000 players have qualified for participating in these games.

My dear countrymen, the exam season has arrived, and obviously all the students will be busy giving final shape to their preparations. After my experience with millions of students of the country through the platform of ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha', I can say with confidence that the youth of the country is brimming with self-confidence and is ready to face every challenge.

Friends, on the one hand, we are facing examinations; on the other, the winter season. Betwixt these two I urge you to try & keep fit. Do some exercises or play a little! Sports & games is the key to keeping fit. By the way, these days, I see that many events pertaining to 'Fit India' are being organised. On January 18, our young friends organized a Cyclothon throughout the country. Millions of countrymen participating in this Cyclothon spread the message of fitness. Efforts to ensure that our New India remains fit that are evident at every level fills us with fervour & enthusiasm. The 'Fit India School' campaign, which started in November last year, is also bringing results. I have been told that till date, more than 65,000 schools have obtained the 'Fit India School' certificates through online registration. I urge the rest of the schools in the country to integrate physical activity and sports with education and ensure that they become a 'fit school'. Also concomitantly, I appeal to all countrymen to promote more physical activity in their daily routine. Remind yourself every day that if we are fit India is fit!

My dear countrymen, a couple of weeks ago, different parts of India were celebrating a variety of festivals. When Punjab was spreading the warmth of enthusiasm by celebrating Lohri, sisters and borthers of Tamil Nadu were celebrating Pongal and birth anniversary of Thiruvalluvar. Assam was aglow with the fascinating lustre of Bihu. In Gujarat, everywhere you could see kites in the sky and the pomp of Uttaraayan. In such an atmosphere, Delhi witnessed a historic event. A significant agreement was signed in Delhi. With it, the close-to-25-year-old Bru-Reang refugee crisis, a painful chapter, was put to an end forever and ever. Due to the busy routine and festive season, you might not have been able to learn about this historic agreement in detail. So I thought, I should definitely discuss this in Mann ki Baat. This problem pertains to the 90s. In 1997, ethnic tension forced the Bru-Reang tribe to leave Mizoram and take refuge in Tripura. These refugees were kept in temporary camps in Kanchanpur in North Tripura. It's painful that the Bru-Reang community lost a significant part of their life as refugees. Life in camps meant that they were deprived of all basic amenities. For 23 years – no home, no land, no medical treatment for their families, no education facilities for their kids. Just imagine, how difficult it must have been for them to live 23 long years in trying circumstances in camps! How painful it would have been to spend every moment, every day of their lives hurtling towards an uncertain future! Governments came and went, but there was no cure for their pain. Despite that, their unwavering belief in the Indian Constitution and culture continued. It's a result of that belief that their life is on the threshold of a new dawn today. As per the agreement, the path to a dignified life has been opened for them. Finally the new decade of 2020, has brought a new ray of hope in the life of the Bru-Reang community. Around 34000 Bru refugees will be rehabilitated in Tripura. Not just that, the government will provide an assistance of close to Rs.600 crores for their rehabilitation and all-round development. Each displaced family will be provided a plot of land. They will be assisted in construction of a house. In addition, rations will be provided to them. They will now be able to benefit from the public welfare schemes of the state and central governments. This agreement is special for many reasons. It symbolises the spirit of cooperative federalism. The Chief Ministers of both Mizoram and Tripura were present during the signing of the agreement. This agreement was made possible only because of the consent and good wishes of people from both the states. I would like to especially express my gratitude to the people and the Chief Ministers of both the states for making this possible. This agreement also epitomises the inherent compassion and sensitivity of Indian culture. Considering everyone as its own and living with the spirit of togetherness is embedded in the ethos of this holy land. I would once again like to congratulate the residents of these states and the Bru-Reang community. 

My dear countrymen, Assam, which hosted the grand 'Khelo India' games successfully, was witness to another great achievement. You might also have seen it in the news, that a few days ago, 644 militants pertaining to 8 different militant groups, surrendered with their weapons. Those who had strayed twards the path of violence, have expressed their faith in peace and decided to become a partner in the country's progress and return to the mainstream. Last year, in Tripura as well, more than 80 people left the path of violence and returned to the mainstream. Those who had picked up weapons thinking that violence could solve problems, now firmly believe that the only way to solve any dispute is peace and togetherness. Countrymen will be thrilled to know that insurgency in the North-East has considerably reduced. And the biggest reason for that is that every issue of this region is being honestly and peacefully solved through dialogue. On the solemn occasion of Republic day, I would appeal to anyone in any part of the country, who's still seeking solutions to problems through violence and weapons, to return to the mainstream. They should have faith in their own capabilities and the capabilities of this country to resolve issues peacefully. We live in the 21st century, that is the era of knowledge, science and democracy. Have you ever heard of a place where life has turned better due to violence? Have you ever heard of a place where peace and goodwill have been impediments in the quest of a good life? Violence never resolves any issue. No problem in the world can be solved by creating another problem. It can only be solved by seeking an optimal solution. Come, let's together forge a new India, where every issue is resolved on a platform of peace. Solidarity should be the key to resolving every issue. And brotherhood, should foil every separatist attempt to divide us. 

My dear countrymen, on the solemn occasion of Republic Day, it gives me great joy to tell you about 'Gaganyaan'. The country has taken another step towards this goal. In 2022, we will be celebrating 75 years of Independence. And on that occasion, we have to fulfil the pledge to take an Indian into space through the Gaganyaan mission. Gaganyaan mission will be a historic achievement in the field of science and technology for India in the 21st century. It will prove to be a milestone for New India. 

Friends, you would be aware that four candidates have been already selected as astronauts for this mission. All of them are pilots of the Indian Air Force. These promising youngsters symbolise India's skill, talent, ability, courage and dreams. Our four friends are about to go to Russia in a few days for their training. I am confident that this would script another golden chapter in India-Russia friendship and cooperation. They will be trained for over a year. After that, the responsibility of carrying the hopes and aspirations of the nation and soaring into space, will rest on the shoulders of one of them. On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I congratulate these four youngsters and the Indian and Russian scientists and engineers associated with this mission. 

My dear countrymen, in March last year, a video had become the centre of attention in the media and the social media. The buzz was about how a 107 year old elderly motherly figure broke the protocol to bless the President. This lady was Saalumarada Timmakka (सालुमरदअ तिम्मक्कअ), who is famous in Karnataka as 'Vriksha Maataa' (Tree Mother). And the ceremony was the Padma Awards distribution. The country recognised and honoured the extraordinary contribution of Timmakka who comes from an ordinary background. She was being decorated with the Padma Shri award ceremony.

Friends, today India feels proud of such great personalities and feels honoured to honour such down to earth, rooted individuals. Like every year, last evening Padma awards were announced. I urge you to read up about each of the awardees. Discuss their contribution with your family. This year over 46000 nominations were received for the 2020 Padma awards. This number is more than 20 times the number of nominations received in 2014. This statistic reveals the faith of every one of us and tells us that the Padma Awards have now become the Peoples' awards. The entire process of the Padma Awards is now completed online. Earlier, the decision was taken by a select few. Now, it's completely people driven. We could even say that there is now a new found faith and respect for these awards in the country. Many among the awardees are those who have risen from the bottom of the pyramid through dint of their hard work. They have overcome limitations of resources and a terrible atmosphere of despair around them and forged ahead. In fact, their strong resolve, spirit of selfless service, inspires us all. Once again, I would like to congratulate all the Padma award recipients. I urge you to read up about them and gather more information. The extraordinary stories of their lives, will inspire the society in the true spirit. 

My dear countrymen, once again many many good wishes for the Republic Day celebrations. May this new decade bring new resolve and new achievements for each of you, and for the country. And may India surely achieve the capabilities to fulfil the expectations that the world has from India. With this belief, come, let's start a new decade. Let's serve Mother India with a new found resolve. Many many thanks. Namaskar. (Goodbye).

                Your Excellency ब्राजील के राष्ट्रपति श्री जेएर बोल्सोनारो
दोनों देशों के वरिष्ठ मंत्री और अधिकारी गणरो
रो
Friends,
नमस्कार।

boa tarde (Good Morning)
bem-vindo à India

मेरे मित्र राष्ट्रपति बोल्सोनारो और उनके उच्च-स्तरीय delegation का मैं भारत में हार्दिक स्वागत करता हूं।पिछले आठ महीनों में यह हमारी तीसरी मुलाकात है। यह हमारे बीच बढ़ती मित्रता और दोनों देशों के बीच गहराते संबंधों को दर्शाती है।

Excellency,
यह हमारे लिए बहुत गर्व की बात है कि हमारे 71वें गणतंत्र दिवस पर आप हमारे मुख्य अतिथि हैं। कल राजपथ पर गणतंत्र दिवस की परेड में आप भारत की विविधता का रंग-बिरंगा और उल्लासपूर्ण स्वरूप देखेंगे। ब्राजील खुद भी उल्लास से भरे पर्वों का देश है। एक मित्र के साथ इस विशेष पर्व पर हम अपनी खुशी साझा करेंगे।भारत का निमंत्रण स्वीकार करने के लिए मैं आपको धन्यवाद देता हूं। यह तीसरा अवसर है जब ब्राजील के राष्ट्रपति ने यह सम्मान हमें दिया है। और भारत और ब्राजील के बीच मजबूत मित्रता का प्रतीक है।

Friends,
भारत और ब्राज़ील की स्ट्रेटेजिक पार्टनरशिप हमारी समान विचारधारा और मूल्यों पर आधारित है।इसलिए, भौगोलिक दूरी के बावज़ूद हम विश्व के अनेक मंचों पर साथ हैं। और विकास में एक-दूसरे के महत्वपूर्ण पार्टनर भी हैं।इसलिए, आज राष्ट्रपति बोल्सानारो और मैं हमारे द्विपक्षीय सहयोग को सभी क्षेत्रों में और बढ़ाने पर सहमत हुए हैं।हमारी Strategic Partnership को और मज़बूत करने के लिए एक वृहद् Action Plan तैयार किया गया है। सन् 2023 में दोनों देशों के बीच diplomatic संबंधों की platinum jubilee होगी। मुझे पूरा विश्वास है कि तब तक यह Action Plan हमारी strategic partnership, people-to-people ties और business cooperation को और गहरा बनाएगा।

मुझे खुशी है कि हमने आज कई महत्वपूर्ण समझौते भी किए हैं। निवेश हो या अपराधिक मामलों में कानूनी सहायता, ये समझौते हमारे सहयोग को नया आधार देंगे। विविध क्षेत्रों, जैसे Bio-Energy, Cattle Genomics, Health and Traditional Medicine, Cyber Security, विज्ञान और प्रोद्योगिकी, तेल और गैस तथा संस्कृति में हमारा सहयोग और तेज़ी से आगे बढ़ेगा।गायों की स्वस्थ और उन्नत प्रजातियों पर सहयोग हमारे संबंधों का एक अनूठा और सुखद पहलू है। किसी समय, भारत से गीर और कंकरेजी गायें ब्राजील गयी थी। और आज, ब्राजील और भारत इस विशेष पशुधन को बढा़ने और उससे मानवता को लाभ पहुंचाने पर सहयोग कर रहे है। इस सहयोग के आर्थिक, सामाजिक और सांस्कृतिक महत्व को किसी भी भारतीय के लिए शब्दों में बयान कर पाना मुश्किल है।

Friends,
परंपरागत क्षेत्रों के अलावा कई नए क्षेत्र भी हमारे संबंधों में जुड़ रहे हैं। हम defence industrial cooperation को बढ़ाने के लिए नए तरीकों पर focus कर रहे हैं। रक्षा सहयोग में हम broad-based partnership चाहते हैं।इन संभावनाओं को देखते हुए हमें खुशी है कि अगले महीने लखनऊ में DefExpo 2020 में ब्राजील का एक बड़ा delegation भाग लेगा।मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि bio-energy, Ayurveda और advanced computing पर research में सहयोग बढ़ाने पर हमारे academic और research institution के बीच सहमति बनी है।

Excellency,
भारत के economic transformation में ब्राज़ील एक valuable partner है। Food और energy के क्षेत्रों में हमारी आवश्यकताओं के लिए हम ब्राज़ील को एक विश्वसनीय स्त्रोत के रूप में देखते हैं।हमारा द्विपक्षीय व्यापार हांलाकि बढ़ रहा है। दोनों बड़ी अर्थव्यवस्थाओं के बीच complementarities (पूरकताओं) को देखते हुए हम इसे बहुत अधिक बढ़ा सकते हैं।आपके साथ ब्राज़ील के प्रभावशाली business delegation का भारत में स्वागत करके हमें खुशी है। मुझे विश्वास है कि भारतीय उद्यमियों और व्यापारियों के साथ उनकी मुलाकातों के अच्छे परिणाम आयेंगे।

Friends,
दोनों देशों की ओर से investment को सुगम बनाने के लिए आवश्यक legal framework तैयार किया गया है। आज के inter-connected विश्व में भारत और ब्राज़ील के बीच Social Security Agreement Professionals के आसान आवागमन के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण कदम है।

Friends,
दो बड़े लोक तांत्रिक और विकासशील देश होने के नाते महत्वपूर्ण global और multilateral मुद्दों पर भारत और ब्राज़ील के विचारों में गहरी समानता है। चाहे आतंकवाद की गंभीर समस्या हो या पर्यावरण का प्रश्न। विश्व के सामने मौजूदा कठिन चुनौतियों पर हमारा नजरिया बहुत मिलता-जुलता है। ब्राजील और भारत के हित समान है। विशेष रूप से BRICS और IBSA में हमारी partnership, भारत की विदेश नीति का एक महत्वपूर्ण पहलू है। आज हमने तय किया है कि दोनों देश multilateral मुद्दों पर अपने सहयोग को और दृढ़ बनायेंगे। और हम सुरक्षा परिषद, संयुक्त राष्ट्र और अन्य अंतर्राष्ट्रीय संगठनों में आवश्यक सुधार के लिए मिलकर प्रयासरत रहेंगे।

साथियों,
मैं एक बार फिर राष्ट्रपति बोल्सनारो और उनके delegation का भारत में स्वागत करता हूं। उनकी यह यात्रा भारत-ब्राजील संबंधों में एक नए अध्याय की शुरूआत है।

Muito obrigado
धन्यवाद।

Many congratulations to all the winners of the Rashtriya Bal Puraskar.  Now you seem tired of hearing everyone congratulating you.  It has been too much isn't it? Is it less or more? Well, while coming here, your teachers must have told you to be in total discipline and not to move a limb. Yes? .... That's wrong.  How do you feel after coming here? I mean, do you love the weather?  Have you seen the entire Rashtrapati Bhavan? What are you going to see today; trees and plants?

 

 How many of you have come to Delhi for the first time?  Okay and everyone else has come here before and is familiar.  These questions are not for the people who are sitting behind. These are for all the children.  People from behind are prompting. 

 

 Although coming to Delhi has its own excitement, yet I know that you must be in a mood to go back home soon.  See, I know that you certainly would like to go home soon; tell friends what all had happened; show them photos and your award; tell them about your experiences in Delhi and about the winters of Delhi. Tell me don't you want to do that?  Everyone wants to tell their friends about the good experiences.

 

 See, there will be many stories of this journey, which you would want to narrate.  Even if you do not admit it, you must be feeling to go to your grandma first and narrate everything.  And there will be some among you who will go home and say - 'look, you were not letting me do it, but now you know that I was doing a good job'.  So, now will you go home and scold mummy and daddy?  Will you say - - 'look, we have a photo with the President, we have brought the award'. Will you do it?  Won't you?  Fine, do it secretly. Will you do it or not?

 

Have you lost your childhood?  Childhood should not be lost; it must be preserved!  Your childhood is lost.  Whoever does not feel like going and telling the parents about his/her experience, has lost childhood.  So, do your parents not leave you?   Do they always hover over you? Don’t they trust you? They might be fearful what the young children might do?  Next time tell them to let you go somewhere alone.

 

 See, when I was getting introduced to you a short while ago, I was really surprised.  At such a young age, the way you all have put your efforts and have achieved so much in different fields, I was indeed flabbergasted! You might as well feel like doing something else tomorrow.  There will be an intention and willingness to do even better things.

 

 And I think that all these awards, etc., are not the end.  In a way, it is the beginning.  When someone gives recognition, it feels good.  In a way, this is the beginning of life.  And you showed courage to fight through difficult situations.  Some of you are brave children. There are some who have made many new innovations for ease of living and to get people out of serious diseases.  Some have excelled in art and culture, some in sports, some in education and literature, some in social service; your contribution has been full of diversities.

 

 You do your duty towards your society, towards the nation. I had said something from the Red Fort. Does anyone remember?  I had said a lot of things.  One thing I had said was to give 'stress on duty'.  Most of the time, we emphasize on rights.  Now we are going to celebrate 75 years of Indian independence. How long will we continue to emphasize upon the rights?  Now should we start emphasizing on duty or not?  Should we give priority to rights or to duty?  Sure? Does everyone agree? OK, so we have passed a law today.

 

 See, the way you are aware of your society and your duties towards the nation, not only your parents, but your family members and whoever knows you will be proud of you.

 

 See, I will do one thing; I will share your story with your photos today with the world on social media.  I will write about each individual, how you have done the work, where have you come from etc.  But if something goes wrong then do not get angry, because sometimes mistakes may creep into the information.

 

 Look friends, although you are all too young, but you know, when it comes to the work that you have done, many scholars are confused just by the thought of the work let alone successfully accomplishing it. Those of you who have innovated, when you must have told your teacher, the teacher would have said -don't bother me, just leave.  The teachers must have become angry thinking that this child is so bright that he has now started teaching me?  It happens, isn't it?  See, I can tell you one thing, you definitely must tell all your friends and teachers.  Whenever I hear about such courageous work of all you and talk to you, I also get inspired. I learn something from you too.  Just now a child asked me - when you do so much work, don't you think of your mother?  When I think of my mother, all the fatigue goes away.

 

 Friends, 

The scope of these National Awards has been extended to encourage this talent hidden within children like you.  And it is not just an award that you are getting; the attention of many other students from all over the country is attracting towards this event.  In a way, you have become a hero for them; you become an inspiration for them.  There will be a child in Jammu and Kashmir, in Ladakh or in Nagaland; if that child listens to the story of a child from Kerala, he will feel good!  This in itself increases its impact manifold; its waves keep moving.  Waves are constantly influencing the bottom and hence these incidents should never be underestimated. They have their own importance.  But what happens sometimes, when our name is published, picture is printed in the newspapers, we tend to become arrogant and are on cloud nine and refuse to keep our feet on ground. Does it happen?  Then at home we say things like- Look, don't ask me to do any work. I have come with the National Award. Does it happen? Will you too do such a thing?  Or will you place your feet on the ground?

 

 There are two milestones in the lives of most people - one goes on doing well with ease and when that person's work is recognized, then knowingly or inadvertently he/she become arrogant and then the person stays in the same state of mind and is unable to do anything new. He feels that the work is done; photo is printed; he has come to Delhi and has seen the Rashtrapati Bhavan.  Now what? Everything has been accomplished in life.  Life is not so short.

 

 

Others are those people - if something is done and if they get recognition somewhere, then they make it their inspiration. They make vows, find ways to make further efforts and achieve new heights.  They don't stop and don't get tired.

 

I would like you to never let those negative habits to enter your life. Consider this event as only the beginning. Tell yourself - I still have a lot to do, I have a lot to offer to the country, I have to prepare myself in every way.  If you follow this passion then you will enjoy this opportunity a lot and you will get to learn something new from it.  So you tell me, which way will you go?  Will you go the first way or the second? Raise your hands - how many of you will go the first way?  Okay now tell me, who will go the second way?  That means you have not understood what I have said.  I was saying that the first path is the one wherein you do not consider this achievement to be the end; rather you consider it as the beginning.  Your feet do not get off the ground and you are not arrogant. You resolve to do something more, this is the first way.  The Second path - you feel it is enough, your photo is printed in the newspapers, you are on TV and you don't want to do anything more.  So tell me, you want to choose the first way or the second?  Certainly, see, I had made a mistake earlier, isn't it?

 

 Okay, let me ask you some questions.  Who are the ones who sweat four times a day and sweat profusely irrespective of the seasons - winters or summers! The ones who sweat four times a day - how do you sweat? Is it by standing in the sun or during the morning exercise?   See, not a single child should be like this. Tell your friends too that there should not be a single child who does not sweat four times a day.  I was once asked by someone many years ago - what brings so much of glow on your face? I gave a very easy answer - I said that my body sweats so much, I work hard and I massage with the same sweat, which is why it glows.  Well, how many of you drink water while standing and not by sitting?  How many people are there?  See, you must sit and drink water.  It is a small thing. Will you do this?

 

 Well, how many of you drink water like medicine?  There will be some people who drink water like juice and enjoy the water too while there will be some people who take it like a medicine. How many of you enjoy water, and the taste of it and enjoy it?  You must enjoy the taste of water and it will benefit the body a lot if you enjoy it. Do not take water like medicine.  Will you?  You will say - what is the use? Mother says, go and study, and if I am drinking water for five minutes, then there will be a quarrel.  Sometimes mother comes with a glass of milk. Mother has work, and TV serial is on. So, mother says, come on quickly finish the milk and you drink the milk like medicine because mother has to watch serial.  It happens, doesn't it?  Which serial was it? 'Saas bhi Kabhi Bahu thi?

 

These are the small things. The habits that we inculcate and instil in the body in our childhood come handy throughout our lives and they fit perfectly in the mind.  You know there is a campaign going on in the country, 'Fit India'. Do you know about it?  How many of you know?  So to which tailor do you go for Fit India? Which tailor do you go to?  Who goes to the tailor for Fit India? So how will anyone explain what Fit India is? Can someone explain? What does one do?  Saying 'exercise' is not enough. Someone will say - I do Surya Namaskar; someone will say - I do cycling; someone will say - I do swimming. What do we do?  Well, how many of you can climb the tree quickly and then get down?  And the family has to shout - Hey get down, get down; how many of you fall in that category?

 

 

See, we must be courageous. If I set my foot here, I might fall; if I do this, something might happen; life is not lived like that in fear.  Life is not possible without courage.  If you make a habit of daring small things, then in future it will be very useful.  And when people like you do it, then 50 other people will see - oh look, he or she has also done it.  They have come with an award, yet are working so hard.  They have come with so much respect, but still are working.  So what will happen - many will get inspiration.  Will you do it?  Will you do it for sure?  So are you prepared for 26 January the day after tomorrow?  So you must have been taught a lot of things and actions?  Do that with the right hand?  Haven't they?  You have to wave in the direction of the people.  Oh, we will be there only up to five meters or ten meters. The rest of the area will have crowd.

 

Well, I loved to spend time with you. Now, you guys enjoy and see as much tourist attractions as possible in Delhi.  Visit different places. You must be aware that a museum has been created for Netaji Subhas Babu and other revolutionaries in the Red Fort.  Will you visit it?  Have you seen the War Memorial?  No? Go and see the War Memorial too.  And if you see some of the brave martyrs from your home state, you can read and write down the name and take home.  If you have a mobile phone then you can also click photos.  Oh, this is the name of a brave martyr from Karnataka, let me click his photo. You must show that photo to your friends and tell them that you have seen the name of the heroic martyr in the War Memorial.  Everyone should find martyrs from his or her own state.  You should feel proud of them.  A police memorial is also built here, will you go and see?  You know there are more than 33000 police martyrs? Sometimes people hate the police, don't they?  Policemen say, ""go away from here; don't keep the bicycle here."" You get very angry, isn't it?  33,000 policemen have been martyred in their attempt to protect the citizens of the country after independence.  The figure is very huge - 33,000!  This should create a sense of respect and pride for the police. See, a change will begin in the societal life.  When you will go and see the police memorial, you will feel that so much was done and they continue to do so.  Will you do it? Sure?

 

Well, thank you very much! Many congratulations!

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today interacted in an At Home event with over 1730 Tribal Guests,, NCC Cadets, NSS Volunteers and Tableaux Artists who would be a part of the 71st Republic Day parade in the National Capital.

 

 

 

Referring to the large enthusiastic gathering, the Prime Minister said they would be showcasing a Mini India at the Republic Day Parade. Saying that the world would see the essence of India during their performance in the Parade, the Prime Minister said India is not a mere geographic or demographic entity.

यहां आप जितने भी साथी एकत्र हुए हैं, आप एक प्रकार से Mini India- New India को showcase करने वाले लोग हैं। भारत असल में क्या है, ये हमारा देश और पूरी दुनिया आपके माध्यम से समझती है: PM @narendramodi pic.twitter.com/SAIzXmDvKT— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 24 January 2020


India is a Way of Life On Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat, Prime Minister said that it should be remembered that India is not only home to 130 crore people but also a nation with a vibrant tradition.

जब हम एक भारत, श्रेष्ठ भारत की बात करते हैं, तो हमें ये भी याद रखना है कि भारत असल में है क्या। भारत क्या सिर्फ सरहदों के भीतर 130 करोड़ लोगों का घर भर ही है? नहीं, भारत एक राष्ट्र के साथ-साथ एक जीवंत परंपरा है, एक विचार है, एक संस्कार है, एक विस्तार है: PM @narendramodi pic.twitter.com/bEZeiIZrsH— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 24 January 2020


He said India is a way of life, an idea, a confluence of several philosophies and a metaphor for a rich global & universal perspective. He said, “India means one Global Family, India means Equanimity for all Religions, India means Triumph of Truth, India means an idea that permits understanding of the One Truth in different ways, India means the one that loves and protects Flora and Fauna, India Means Self Reliance, India believes that only those who sacrifice can remain blissful, India means the one which believes in welfare of everyone, India means one which worships women, India means one which believes that motherland is more virtuous than Gold” Belief in Unity and not Uniformity The Prime Minister said India’s strength is its diversity in geological and social fabric. He compared India to a floral garland where different flowers stitched together through a common thread of Indianness. He said, “India believes in Unity and not Uniformity. “ Shri Modi said, “Strengthening that thread of unity and preserving it is our continuous effort and toil” He said as a New India progresses, the effort is to see that no one is left behind and no region is left behind. Striving for Fundamental Duties The Prime Minister said that it is time now to give importance to our fundamental duties. “If we deliver our duties sincerely, then there would be no necessity for fighting for our rights'' he said.

यहां जितने भी युवा साथी आए हैं, मेरा आपसे आग्रह रहेगा कि राष्ट्र के प्रति अपने कर्तव्यों की ज्यादा से ज्यादा चर्चा करें। चर्चा ही नहीं, बल्कि खुद अमल करके, उदाहरण पेश करें। हमारे ऐसे ही प्रयास न्यू इंडिया का निर्माण करेंगे: PM @narendramodi pic.twitter.com/rvxAfggq1W— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 24 January 2020


Prime Minister Shri Modi also witnessed a cultural programme showcased by the Tribal Guests, NCC Cadets, NSS Volunteers and Tableaux Artists

Friends! I welcome you all here.



Day after tomorrow you all have a major test and I know that you will pass it with flying colours; you will succeed!

I wish you all the best for Republic Day and for the Republic Day Parade!

Friends,

All the friends who have gathered here, in a way showcase a Mini India. Our country and the whole world understand and see the real India through you!

When a rich tradition of discipline and service is seen on Rajpath through NCC and NSS, crores of youth of the country get inspired and encouraged. When you venture out on the Rajpath with a tableau depicting the rich art and culture of the country and the heritage of India, the whole world is mesmerized. Our tribal friends, in particular, bring out a wonderful and unique legacy in front of the country and the world through their performances.

Despite such chilly weather, you are working hard in this way, and are constantly engaged. It is indeed very praiseworthy.

This time when I will be attending the parade, it will be a great satisfaction to have met every Tableau Artist and thank them.

Friends,

You bring the country's diversities to Delhi and carry the message of diversity that we see on Republic Day in Delhi to your respective regions. You fulfil the idea of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' come true.

When we talk of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat', we also have to remember what India really is. Is India just a frontier which is home to 130 crore people? No; India is a nation as well as a vibrant tradition, an idea, a sacrament and an expanse!

Meaning of India - वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्

Meaning of India - सर्व पंथ समभाव

Meaning of India - सत्यमेव जयते

Meaning of India - अहिंसा परमो धर्मः
 

 Meaning of India- एकम सद विप्राः बहुधाः वदन्ति; that is, the truth is the same, the attitude of seeing it is different.


The meaning of India - वैष्णव जन तो तेने कहिये जे पीड परायी जाणे रे


India means God's abode in trees and plants.

The meaning of India- तेन त्यक्तेन भुन्जिथा; means those who renounce only enjoy.

Meaning of India - सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः
Meaning of India - public service is service to God.

India means - जननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी; i.e. the status of mother and birthplace is even greater than heaven.

India is a life force embodied with many such ideals and ideas. India is such a flow of energy.

Therefore, whenever we talk about the unity and superiority of India, we must mention the superiority of these ideals and values, besides the geographical and economic superiority. 

Friends,

 

Strength of India's superiority lies in its geographical and social diversity. Our country is a kind of garland, where colourful flowers are strung together with the thread of Indian-ness.

We are for unity, not uniformity. We are trying to keep the unity formula alive and strong and this is the message of unity.

Many states but one nation; many societies but one India; many creeds but one goal; many dialects but one voice; many languages but one expression; many colours but one tricolour (flag); many customs but same values; several duties but one resolution; several ways but one destination; several faces but one smile. We must work continuously to carry the nation forward with this mantra of unity.

Friends,

The whole world also sees this strength of India through your performances on Rajpath. It also has an effect in the propagation of India's soft power and also boosts India's tourism sector. This sentiment is further strengthened by our youth exchange programme.

Friends,

I am told that this year the young friends from NCC and NSS have played an effective role in relief and rescue operations during disasters as well as in sports. NSS is the country's largest blood donation organization. 8 lakh youth have also participated in the Cyclathon for the Fit India campaign.

Similarly, NCC cadets have done a commendable job on Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, taking out 8,000 km of cleanliness journey across the country. Moreover, more than 1 lakh NCC cadets helped in relief and rescue work during floods and other disasters in Bihar, Kerala, Karnataka, Odisha and Maharashtra.

I am telling you these figures because there is not much discussion about these commendable works in the country. But your hard work and the work done for the country also has become a big inspiration for me.

Friends,

This is our 71st Republic Day. For the past 70 years, as a Republic, we have set a perfect example in front of the whole world.

In such a situation, we need to pay attention to one aspect of the Constitution of the country that could not be discussed in great detail in the last seven decades. We must give prominence and priority to our duties as citizens. If we are able to perform our duties properly, then we will not have to fight for our right.

All the young friends who have come here, I would urge you to discuss about your duties towards the nation as much as possible. And you must not only hold discussions but also set an example. Similar efforts will create a New India.

Friends,

Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, wrote an article titled 'India of my dreams'. In the book, he wrote that a person with the highest aspirations can get everything he needs for his development in India.

All of you are part of this dream and idea of Gandhiji. We have to fulfil the same aspirations and dreams as we are moving towards a New India. We have to ensure that no person and no region in India are left behind. This is also the reason behind the Republic Day parade.

Friends,

We all have to associate ourselves with the collective resolutions of the nation. Efforts have to be made together to make the life of every individual of the country easier. Many of you are going to write examinations after some time. This is a crucial time for you.

I wish you all the best for the upcoming exams. Besides that, I also wish you the very best for Republic Day parade.

You came here to meet me, thank you very much for that.

 


Thank you!

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi interacted with recipients of Rashtriya Bal Puraskar, here today. The awards were conferred by the President of India on 22 Jan 2020. The awardees will also participate in the Republic Day Parade.

 

The 49 awardees are from various states of India including one each from Jammu & Kashmir, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. The children are winners in the fields of art & culture, Innovation, Scholastic, Social Service, Sports and Bravery. The Government of India acknowledges children as one of the most important partners in nation-building.

थोड़ी देर पहले आप सभी का परिचय जब हो रहा था, तो मैं सच में हैरान था। इतनी कम आयु में जिस प्रकार आप सभी ने अलग-अलग क्षेत्रों में जो प्रयास किए, जो काम किया है, वो अदभुत है: PM @narendramodi pic.twitter.com/L0PE4XYiGv— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 24 January 2020



 

Admiring the outstanding achievements of the children in different fields, the Prime Minister termed the work done by them at such a young age as amazing. He said, “I am proud to see the way in which you are fulfilling your duties towards society and the nation. It gives me that extra energy and the push to work harder when I hear the stories of bravery and achievements of our young comrades”

 


आप अपने समाज के प्रति, राष्ट्र के प्रति अपनी ड्यूटी के लिए जिस प्रकार से जागरूक हैं, ये देखकर गर्व होता है: PM @narendramodi pic.twitter.com/USU0Wo2Y5N— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 24 January 2020



 

The Prime Minister asked the awardee children to work harder while being strongly rooted to the ground realities. “This recognition should be a beginning to achieve more and you should realise this is not an end in itself. And such awards will inspire your peers and other children to become achievers.”

 

मैं आप सभी युवा साथियों के ऐसे साहसिक काम के बारे में जब भी सुनता हूं, आपसे बातचीत करता हूं, तो मुझे भी प्रेरणा मिलती है, ऊर्जा मिलती है: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 24 January 2020

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his Jayanti.

“On 23rd January 1897, Janakinath Bose wrote in his diary, “A son was born at midday.” This son became a valorous freedom fighter and thinker who devoted his life towards one great cause- India’s freedom. I refer to Netaji Bose, who we proudly remember on his Jayanti today.

India will always remain grateful to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose for his bravery and indelible contribution to resisting colonialism. He stood up for the progress and well-being of his fellow Indians” the Prime Minister said.

                My friend and honorable Prime Minister of Nepal Honorable K.P. Sharma Oli Ji,
Senior ministers and officials of both countries,

Namaskar!

First of all, on my behalf and on behalf of all Indians, I wish New Year 2020 greetings to Oli Ji and all our friends in Nepal.

It is not just the New Year, but a new decade has begun. I wish that this new decade brings good health, long life, progress, happiness and peace for all of you.

The festival of solstice was also celebrated in different regions of the two countries last week with different looks, but equal gaiety. I would also like to wish you all the best on the occasion of this festival.

Excellency,

It is only at the beginning of this new year and new decade that we are joining together in this auspicious work today. It is a matter of great joy.

For the second time in the last five months, we are inaugurating bilateral projects between the two countries by video link. It symbolizes the expansion and rapid development of Indo-Nepal relations.

Friends,

In the all-round development of Nepal, India has been playing the role of a reliable partner according to Nepal's priorities.

""Neighborhood First” has been my Government's priority. And increasing cross-border connectivity is one of the main goals of this policy.

The importance of better connectivity increases even more when it comes to India and Nepal. Because our relationships are not just neighborly. History and geography have connected us with nature, family, language, culture, progress and how many more threads.

Therefore, good connectivity between the two countries connects our lives more closely and opens up new avenues between our hearts.

Connectivity works as a catalyst for the development of not only the country but the region as a whole.

India is committed to simplify and smooth traffic with all friendly countries in the neighborhood, and to further facilitate contacts between us in business, culture, education, etc.

India and Nepal are working on several cross-border connectivity projects such as road, rail and transmission lines. Integrated check posts at major borders between our countries are greatly facilitating mutual trade and movement.

Excellency,

In the first phase of construction of ICP, we had decided to develop ICP in Birganj and Biratnagar. We inaugurated Birganj's ICP in 2018.

Now the introduction of ICP in Biratnagar is a matter of great pleasure. This facility is already available in Raxaul and Jogbani towards India.

I am confident that we will develop more such modern facilities in the coming years.

Excellency,

The 2015 earthquake was a painful accident. Natural calamities like earthquakes test man's tenacity and determination. Every Indian is proud that the sad consequences of this tragedy were faced by our Nepalese brothers and sisters with courage.

After the first Responder's active role in rescue and aid, India has stood shoulder to shoulder with its Nepalese comrades in reconstruction. It was our duty as a close neighbor and friend.

Therefore, I was very satisfied to see good progress in rebuilding houses in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts.

It has been our endeavor to build these houses on the principle of 'Build Back Better'. And make them strong and durable using 'earthquake resilient techniques'.

In launching Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, India aims to reduce the impact of natural disasters on infrastructure.

It is a matter of great satisfaction that forty-five thousand out of fifty thousand houses have been constructed under Indo-Nepal cooperation. We hope that the construction of the remaining houses will also be completed soon. And these houses will soon be handed over to our Nepali brothers and sisters.

Excellency,

With your cooperation, there has been unprecedented progress in Indo-Nepal relations over the past several years. Our cooperation and development partnerships are advancing rapidly. Also, we have started cooperation in many new areas.

I wish that with your cooperation and support in the New Year, we take our relationship to a higher level. And this new decade becomes the golden decade of Indo-Nepal relations.

Once again I wish you good health and success. And I also thank you very much for joining this program through video link.

In the end, I wish you all the very best.

Namaskar!

                Namaste, your friend is once again amongst you. First of all, I extend my best wishes to you for 2020, the new year. This is not just a new year of 2020, it’s a new decade. This decade is as important to India as it is to you. It means the students of Class 10 and 12 will contribute majorly to what the country does in this decade. A lot depends on this generation for making this decade important and reaching new heights with new dreams, new promises, new aspirations and new principles. And therefore, I convey my best wishes to you for this decade.

I am associated with the government for a long time. I was chief minister for a long time, and now again you have entrusted me with this responsibility. Therefore, I have to go to several programmes. I get an opportunity to meet various kinds of people. And every time, it is a new experience. I get to know and learn. Every programme has its own importance. But if somebody asks me to choose the most cherishing programme and one that is very close to my heart, then I will say it is “Pariksha Par Charcha” (Discussion on Exam). I really like when you send me something in writing while preparing for it. There are thousands of schools and hardly any tehsil of the country which does not partake in programme. I can feel what the young minds across different parts of the country think, want and what they can do. I enjoy the most when children tell me things so well.

Similarly, when I go to a hackathon meet with the young, I can feel that India has a bright future and can move ahead with a new imagination. There is also an opportunity for me to learn whenever I get to meet the youth and the young generations at such programmes. Had I not done the “Pariksha Par Charcha”, there was no danger to the Prime Minister’s Chair and no editorial in any newspaper would have commented on what the Prime Minister does? This I have decided on my own. When you are about to qualify your ninth class, your parents tend to worry about Class 10th, 11th and 12th. Don’t they tell you, you are a grown-up….you are in 12th class.  You must be hearing this dialogue 100 times in a day. Isn’t it? Therefore, I decided that I should lessen the burden of your parents. Since I am part of your family, I thought why don’t I do the same in a collective way what they do otherwise. There is a saying in Gujarati -- “पारकी मां कान विंधे” – which means when our ears are pierced. I also used to wear it. Mother used to put a small twig of neem.  Students often complain that their parents repeat the same thing every day. But if somebody from outside the family says, it gets registered properly. May be, I also do the same what your parents, guardians and teachers do. But I do it differently with a sense of belongingness – by becoming your friend, partner and your colleague. Therefore, I also find satisfaction that I am no burden to you.

I hope you are not thinking what the Prime Minister will say, will we have to do the same after reaching homes. So, today we start the discussion without any filter. We will talk in the same way as you do amongst your friends. There would be no pressure, only light-hearted discussion. There may be mistakes. I can also commit. And if I do, then TV journalists will have a field day. I can’t please them very much, but if they find some pleasure out of it, I also enjoy. Ok friends, let’s begin. Who is asking the first question?

Presenter:  There is an air of festivity in this assembly hall after your enthusiastic and motivational address. More than 30 crore students, teachers and parents from 25 countries along with thousands of students in this assembly hall are going to benefit from it. Sir, with your blessings and permission, we would like to begin a series of questions beneficial to all the students, teachers and parents.

So, we now move to the special episode of “Pariksha Par Charcha” 2020 with the permission of the Prime Minister.

Sir, Yashri, a 10th class student from the land of dignity and glory, Rajasthan, is present here and she wants your guidance. Ask your question Yashri.

Questioner – Good Morning Sir, I am Yashri from Swami Vivekanand Government Model School, Rajasthan. My classmates and I are appearing for board exam this year. Many a time, our mood gets turned off. So Sir, please motivate us and give some suggestions to face the exams without any stress and nervousness. Thank You.

Presenter – Thank you Yashri. Respected Prime Minister, Yashri wants to know that the thought of Board examination turns her mood off. How should she motivate herself to work hard?

PM – I was thinking that youngsters should not have their mood off. But have we ever thought why there are mood swings? Is the reason due to oneself or due to some external factor? Many a time, you must have noticed that sometimes the mood becomes off, one does not feel like doing anything.  In most of the cases, it is due to external factors. For example, if you tell your mother to prepare tea at 6 o’clock as you are studying. But did you notice that you might be studying but your eyes are watching the clock in between to check the time. The problem starts from there. And if the mother gets late, a storm builds up inside you. What does the mother think; she just does not understand that I am preparing for Class 10th exam. I had asked for tea at 6 o’clock – and then your mood gets spoiled. Now think it differently. All these things happened, but you thought – Oh! Mother works so hard, she is always concerned about me; something must have happened that’s why Mother could not bring tea at 6 o’clock. Let me check the mother whether she is alright. Now tell me, your mood will become spoiled or charged up. It is because you have not tied your desire so much so that even if it does not get fulfilled, your mood would not get spoiled.

If we make it a habit … You must have seen if five-six friends have planned some game and are going to play it and if one of them does not come by then. You must have noticed that of the five who have reached there, there must be two others who would throw tantrums that he has not come, he is late and we also have to return early. There would be three others who would say don’t be upset, he will come. How do we manage our mind? Every person in his life has to go through mood swings as far as motivation and de-motivation is concerned. One has to go through this several times. Sometimes, we are very motivated to do something, but get de-motivated in case of failure.  

See, all of you were awake in the night during the Chandrayaan mission. Was there any contribution from you to send Chandrayaan? No. But all of you were glued before TV sets as if it was your accomplishment. Was it not this feeling? And when the mission did not succeed, then all of you, the scientists and the entire India became de-motivated. Sometimes failure leads us to this feeling. I was also present there that day. Today, I will share one secret with you. Some people advised me not to go there as there was no guarantee of the success of the programme. What will you do if you go there and the mission fails? I told them this is precisely why I should go there. In the last few minutes, I saw changes on scientists’ faces; I could sense tension as they were looking at each other. I could make out that there was some mishap. I am not a scientist, but I could make out something untoward was happening by looking at their faces. Then they came to me and told me about it. I told them you are trying. It’s fine. I am sitting here. Then after ten minutes, they told me that their efforts did not yield results. Then I sat together with the scientists, made a round inside and told them not to worry.  By the time I reached hotel, it was 3 a.m.  But I was not at peace with myself, did not feel like sleeping. Our PMO staff had retired to their rooms. I spent about 30-45 minutes strolling. Then I told them to call everybody. I called them who had already slept off. I told them we will change our departure programme early morning. We will not leave early morning, but will leave after some time. I asked them whether I could meet these scientists at around 7.30-8 a.m. I could have got up in the morning and left. Nobody would have taken note of it. There was no such requirement. But I could not explain myself. Therefore, I met those scientists in the morning, expressed my feelings and encouraged them for their hard work. I talked with them about the dreams of the country. The whole atmosphere changed. It was not there alone, the mood changed all over India. I don’t want to say further, but you must have watched it on your TV. What I want to say is that we can learn lessons of success from failures too. We can work with enthusiasm in every effort. If you don’t succeed in something, it means you are on way to success. If you get stuck there, no amount of tractors can pull you out. If you decide yourself, you can come out of that situation. So, this is all about motivation and demotivation. You must be aware of a 2001 cricket match in Kolkata between India and Australia. Many of you were not born then. India was in a pathetic situation and it was made to follow-on. When India came out to bat again, wickets started tumbling. The atmosphere was full of demotivation. The audience also keeps on expressing its resentment. It forgets that these are their own people who are playing and should be encouraged. Then Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman played a wonderful innings and continued playing till the evening and changed the situation. Not only this, India went on to win the match. Though the atmosphere was depressing, but one resolution – how could we lose, we will fight together and show our prowess to each and every ball. And the result was victory. In 2002 also, India’s very good bowler Anil Kumble’s jaw was hit due to a bouncer when India had gone to West Indies. You can understand the pain. Everybody was worried whether Anil would be able to bowl or not. He did not care for the pain. Had he simply sat crying and not played, nobody would have blamed him. But he decided to play no matter how much pain he was enduring. With bandage all over his face, he took to the field again. You know it would have been a very big achievement then to scalp the wicket of Brian Lara. And he changed the complexion of the game by taking Lara’s wicket. One person’s resolution can become a big reason of motivation for others.  You must have faced several such incidents in your life. It depends how you manage your emotions, how you look at it?  If we can control it, there will be mood swing, but in the next few moments you will be able to manage it. Then you will be able to continue with a fresh mind. Thank you.

Presenter—Sir, you have cleared all the hurdles which come while chasing goals. Now the mood has been refreshed, Sir. Thank you.  Sir, Mayank Negi, the 10th class student of Blooming Vale Public School from Honorable Prime Minister’s spiritual place Kedarnath in Uttarakhand state, wants your guidance. May we have the question, please?

Questioner – Good morning, Honorable Prime Minister. I am a Class 10 student of Blooming Vale Public School, Kotdwar, Uttarakhand. Successful people like Bill Gates, Thomas Edison and Mark Zuckerberg were not successful in their early life. One cannot judge somebody on the basis of marks scored in examination. Honorable Sir, my question is how much should we concentrate so as to secure good marks in examination? Thank you.

Presenter – Thank you, Mayank. Respected Prime Minister, Mayank wants to know whether marks secured in exams are the only criteria for success.

PM – Your concern is valid and perhaps every student has to face this whether at home or in school. As far as education is concerned, we are knowingly or unknowingly moving towards a direction where marks have become turning point as far as success or failure is concerned. Therefore, it is in the back of mind that getting marks is more important.  Parents also create this atmosphere that once you score good marks in Class 10, there will be no problem and your path will become clear. And when a student is in Class 11, they will say Class 12 is very important and put your maximum efforts.  The same thing happens when one prepares for entrance exams. Actually, their aim is to motivate and encourage their children. It could have been a correct approach at one time. But today, the world has changed and there are huge possibilities. Life is not about marks in exams. Similarly, any examination is not life, it is just a halt. This should be considered as an important point, but one should never think that this is everything in life. I request parents please don’t do it. This has been done, fine, but could have been better. But to think that your world is lost because it did not happen accordingly is not appropriate in today’s time. There are so many scopes. You can choose any of them in your life.

You must have noticed. A farmer, who may not have adequate school education,  but he learns, experiences, adopts technology, changes the patterns of farming, modernizes and makes life so valuable. Therefore, I would like to make it clear that exams are very important, but life is not about examination only. We should come out of this thinking. There are several things in our life. We can move ahead with those.

Presenter – Thank you, honorable Prime Minister. Your words are source of inspiration for all of us. The next question comes from the heart of India, the State of Madhya Pradesh. Prajakta  Atankar, a student of class IXth of  Kendriya Vidyalaya, Jabalpur, joins us to ask her question. Could we have the question please?

Questioner -- My name is Prajakta Atankar and I am from Kendriya Vidyalaya, Jabalpur MP. My question to honorable Prime Minister is that the balance between co-curricular activities and studies is very important. But these activities distract the children. Is it so?

Presenter – There is somewhat similar question.  Riya Negi, the ninth standard student of Government  Girls Senior Secondary School No. 2, Delhi, wants answer to her question. Riya is in the auditorium. Riya, please ask your question.

Questioner – Honorable Prime Minister, I, Riya Negi, am student of Class nine. I study in Government  Girls Senior Secondary School No. 2. I am from Delhi and my question to you is what will be the future of those students who are not very good in studies, but are brilliant in other fields like sports, or music? Please give your opinion.

Presenter – Thank you Riya. Sir, there is another question which is very much similar to it. A resident of Hugli, Kolkata, the land of Great Saint Vivekanand and Noble Laureate Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore, Anamika Bhunia of Jawahar Navodaya Vidalaya is here with us in the audience to ask her question. Anamika, please ask your question.

Questioner -- Honorable, Prime Minister Sir, I am Anamika Bhunia, studying in class XIth Science. I am from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Hugli, West Bengal. My question is, how can we make a balance between our extra-curricular activities and academic activities? Sir, please give us some suggestions.  Thank You. 

Presenter – Thank you, Anamika. Sir, Prajakta, Riya and Anamika are anxious to know how to make a balance between extra-curricular activities and academic activities?

PM – Okay, I want to ask you a question. Will you answer? How many amongst you believe that if I do extra-curricular activity, then it affects my studies. How many are there who believe in it? Nobody!  Okay, how many are those who believe that studies are important, but other activities are equally important in life? Okay, there is less enthusiasm. Okay, third question – How many are those who believe that there should be extra-curricular activity and who do it regularly? We have to change this situation. See, the education that we get opens doors to a huge world. We enter the world though that only. When a child learns alphabets, A or क, it means he is entering into a new world. He will learn alphabet first, after that he will learn two letter words, then three letter words; after that he will learn two-two words. He started with क, but where did he reach? For, that was an entrance point.  Our complete education gives us the opportunity to do and learn something. We have to move forward on the basis of it. If somebody perfects ‘Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa’ and India’s top-most people from the world of music appreciate him…  ‘Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa’ is an entrance point to the world of music. Once he masters it, he gets an opportunity to experience all the disciplines of music. But if he says that I have learnt music, know ‘Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa’, now I will not have to do anything. What will happen? Whatever we learn should be tested daily. One should not only get tested in question-answers of the teacher, but should be tested on the yardsticks of life. If it has been taught in class to speak less as it is beneficial then one should give it a try. If you commit a mistake and your parents are rebuking you, then you should try whether it will be of any use here to speak less as told to you in your class. If you don’t do any extra-curricular activity, you will become a robot and will do the same work from morning to evening as the robot does according to the software which has been installed in it. Do we want that our country’s youths become robots? No. Our youths should be full of energy, should have dreams, and should display courage and ability. If he does not possess these qualities, nothing will happen.  Therefore, we should not be indifferent towards other activities. This is true that there should proper management of time, there should be balance. But never trash other activities. There was a time when there were not many opportunities. People then believed that books will open doors. Today, it is not like this.  Today, there are so many opportunities. We can surely get the results if we make genuine efforts. Therefore, I would like that extra-curricular activities should be promoted. But there is an enormity these days and which is very serious. Extra-curricular activity has become a fashion statement for parents. When parents sit amongst their friends, they enjoy while talking about their son who goes for cricket coaching in the morning, plays tennis at 10 a.m., then he goes for swimming at 11 a.m., and then he learns Manipuri dance at 5 p.m. Sometimes, parents think that extra-curricular activity is glamour driven and looks nice in the form of a celebrity.  They think that they will also ask their children to do such activity. What happens then? As the parents pressurize their children regarding studies, they are now putting pressure on extra- curricular activity. Some of you must be going through it? Okay, you won’t tell me.

I know you predicament. You must be thinking what if our parents saw it on TV if we said something. Parents also have a duty to find out interests in their children and should try to guide them to such activities.  But getting hitched to extra-curricular activity should be done in a well structured way. Only then you can evaluate yourself and find satisfaction in life. You may have seen many people in the age group of 35-40 saying it has become difficult to pursue something now. They regret that we did not do this or that during our school days. We don’t know anything. Then life becomes a burden.

If you make a habit of living a life with diversities during your school days, then it becomes very useful in the later part of your life. As the classroom education becomes important, so does these activities after the age of 35-40.  Therefore, one should not consider either of the two as each other’s enemy. First, one should not consider that it is doing any damage. We should do some extra-curricular activity. Secondly, I will tell the students of Class 10 and 12 to do something extra. Even if you do it for 5, 10 or 15 minutes, your mind will be refreshed. If you get immersed in books, and repeat the same thing 10-20 times, you will be tied down. So, please don’t let this happen.

Presenter – Thank you Prime Minister for your guidance. K.Divya is a class 10th student of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Andaman. She seeks respected Prime Minister’s view points on certain issues.  Could we have the question please?

Questioner -- Honorable, Prime Minister Sir, Namaskar.  I am K. Divya of Class 10 from Government Model Secondary School, Andaman and Nicobar Island. My question to you is what should be the role of modern technology in a student’s life?          

Presenter -- Question comes from Deepesh Rai, a student of class XIIth of Namchi Secondary School, South Sikkim, and who has travelled all the way from Sikkim to be here with us in the audience. Deepesh, please ask your question.

Questioner -- Good Morning every one. Honorable, Prime Minister. My name is Deepesh Rai, studying in class XII from Namchi Secondary School, Sikkim. Sir, my question is that many children in the world are using educational technology to learn better. So, how can we have it?

Presenter – Thank you, Deepesh. Sir, Divya and Deepesh want to know how science and technology can be helpful to the students. Please guide us.

PM – Perhaps, since the last period of the last century and the beginning of this century, science and technology have completely transformed life. In a way, life has also become technology-driven. Therefore, now, one should not have any fear regarding technology. What will I do, if the new technology comes? It should not be allowed. And secondly, if the technology came then my entire life will be ruined. Earlier, I used to think like that and would do accordingly.  How will I cope if a new thing comes up?

No. Consider technology as your friend. We should try to understand the changes in technology, we should be proactive. Thirdly, will the knowledge of technology be used just only as a show-off amongst friends? Because, I know what is happening in the world, a new camera has come, or a new mobile phone has been launched. No. Effort should be made to make the best use of technology in the work. Will technology consume my time? Many are sharing their experiences that technology kills their time.

How many of you use smart phones? Tell me, don’t hesitate, your teachers are not watching. Now, you tell me how much of your time is consumed by this smart phone? And if you just reduce the time on it by 10 percent, and spend that time with your mother and grandparents. I am just asking for 10 minutes, not more than this. If you take just 10 minutes out of your smart phone and spend that time with your mother and grandparents, then what will be useful – Technology or the time spent with your grandparents? What will happen?  We should see to it that our time is not eaten up by technology. We should have the will power to keep technology in our command.

I will use technology as and when I wish. You go to a railway station and there is an information counter at the railway station. There are many officials sitting there to answer queries regarding the timings of train, registration, etc.  Above that there is a huge electronic billboard. It has all the information regarding train’s name, its destination, the platform where it will come, whether it is late or on time. But we who belong to the older generation, what do we do. We will stand in a queue outside the window. We will look upon the billboard but won’t read the message. The response to my query is there, it is displaying all the information on Delhi Express, Jammu-Tawi Express, like when it will depart, when it will arrive on which platform, or is late by 5-7 minutes.

You must also have seen many people who after messaging will call the person to check whether he has received the message? What does the new generation do? It uses technology.  It already checks on mobile phone and finds out all the relevant information about time and decides when to leave from house. Do they do it or not? What I want to say is he has made the right use of the technology. See the difference. There is one generation which does not want to see what is there right in front of it, and then there is the new generation which is not ready to ask as it believes in technology.  It means they know the usefulness of the technology.

One should have very good vocabulary. I will request you to choose either your mother language or any language which you like – be it English or Hindi – and use the dictionary in your mobile phone to learn the spelling and meaning of at least 10 new words. Now tell me, technology is useful or not. But you must also try to avoid such a situation when your parents fight with you over time being spent with your friends or on phone.

There was a time when social networking was considered to be very essential. People used to leave their homes for at least 1-2 hours in the evening to go to a function or meet friends. They used to meet people so as to remain connected with the society, which benefits both sides. This is a normal order. But slowly and slowly, social networking has been distorted. Now WhatsApp is doing our social networking. The present social networking is the distorted version of the original. Earlier, we would go to our friend’s place early morning to surprise him on his birthday. Now at 12 in the night, we use technology to send the message and go off to sleep. If technology takes over our life, then our life will become very idle. Therefore, while there should be maximum use of technology, we should not become its slave either. But technology is changing every moment. If you have to take your life forward, you should have interest and knowledge towards new technology. You should also ask others about the new technology. This interest should be developed from the days of student life. You will benefit a lot. As far as I am concerned, I have deep interest and curiosity in technology even though I don’t know much about it. I listen to people and ask them. Now-a-days, I don’t get that opportunity as I am tied down in governance. But earlier, when I used to travel in a plane, I would ask the person sitting next to me about anything which would be with him. What is its usefulness, how it is used? I always had the curiosity and I have benefited a lot due to that.  I would like you to make technology as your life’s friend. But don’t allow the technology to become part of your life. You must have seen there is a family of three people and all the three are sitting in three different corners and everybody is busy on mobile.

Can you do two things? Will you do? What will you do because I have not told you about the work? First, you will decide to keep technology away from you for one-two hours when you are free.  Every day, one or two technology-free hours… Can you do it? No gadget, nothing. Whatever hour you choose, you will spend that with your family, friend, in garden, and with a pet like dog or a cat if you have one. There are some very poor families who have two-three rooms and they have no problem with technology. Once you go home today after this function, you will sit with your parents and decide upon a room where there should be no entry for technology. Can you do this? Whosoever goes to that room will sit there without any gadget. You do this and your life will be full of experiences. While I emphasize on the importance of technology, at the same time, I am also concerned that the person inside me does not become a robot.  Therefore, there are ways to make a balance between the two, which I have shared with you.

Presenter – Thank you sir. We will find success in our life with your cooperation. From the land of Rising Sun, Arunachal Pradesh, Tapi Aku from JNV Papumpare is present here. She wants to ask you a question, honorable Prime Minister, Aku, please ask your question.

Questioner -- Honorable Prime Minister, very warm greetings from the land of Rising Sun, Arunachal Pradesh. I am Tapi Aku studying in standard 12th from JNV Papumpare Arunanchal Pradesh. Mr. Prime Minister, I very much liked you speech in parliament on rights and duties. How can we create awareness among the countrymen regarding duties? Thank you.

Presenter – Thank you Aku. There is another question similar to this one. We have with us Shailash Kumar from KV Chennai.  He is a class XIth student from Tamil Nadu, a state famed for its heritage temples. The next question is from him. Could we have the question please?

Questioner -- Namskar Sir. My name is P Shailash Kumar. I am a student of class XIth in Kendriya Vidyalaya, Chennai. Sir, being a student, what are my rights and what duties I need to perform?

Presenter – Thank you Shailash. There is one more question similar to this one. Sir, from the esteemed Gujarat  which boasts of personalities like the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, Dayanand Saraswati and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Gunakshi Sharma from Maharaja Agrasen School wants to ask you a question. Gunakshi, please ask your question.

Questioner – Good morning. My name is Gunakshi Sharma. I am a student of Class 10. I study in Maharaja Agrasen School, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Sir, I want to ask you a question that I have studied about the citizen’s rights and duties in civics. Please tell, what is more important between the two? Thanks.

Presenter – Thanks Gunakshi. Respected Prime Minister, request you to solve the curiosity of Shailash, Gunakshi and Aku regarding citizen’s duties.

PM – This question has been asked by the daughter of Arunachal Pradesh, so it is natural for the daughter of Arunachal Pradesh to ask this question. I don’t know whether anybody from you have visited Arunachal Pradesh. Arunachal Pradesh is the only state in the country where people greet each other with Jai Hind. This is very rare in India. This change happened after the 1962 war. Similarly, besides their own language, people there have mastered English and Hindi languages. I request you to visit North-East once during vacation.  I know, first you will go to Singapore, then Dubai. Yes, after that you will go there, if an opportunity came. You will do like this, no? Our country is very amazing and you should experience it.

 When I came here, children were telling me about different paintings which they have drawn. And the pleasant experience was that the children were introducing themselves in another language besides their own mother tongue. A girl from Maharashtra was introducing herself in Oriya, whereas another girl from Dehradun was introducing herself in Malayalam language. While we are emphasizing on “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat” (One India, Best India), these children have made good attempts. I will request you all that you should know your mother tongue, English, Hindi and at least one more language. Our country is full of resources.  Now the topic is duty. Problem arises when we speak the words Rights and Duties simultaneously. It appears as if both rights and duties are two different expressions. It’s not like that.  All our rights are subsumed in our duties. If I do duty as a teacher, then the rights of students are protected or not. So, there is no argument between rights and duties.

Mahatma Gandhi would very respectfully say that there are no fundamental rights, but there are fundamental duties. If we carry out our duties honestly then we will not have to beg for our rights, because our rights will be protected. Secondly, sometimes, we have some obligations. Like in a family, parents have their own obligations, child has his own.  Our neighbours also fulfill their obligations, but the discussion is not limited here. We have some duties towards such a big nation which we should be obliged to offer. Shouldn’t we do something to take our country forward? In 2022, our independence is completing 75 years and 100 years in 2047. Have you ever thought where you will be in 2047 when the country will be celebrating the 100th year of its Independence Day?   You will be playing some role in your capacity.  Leadership does not mean to work like a frog.  There is leadership in every sphere of the life. A cricket captain also offers leadership. A kabaddi captain also provides leadership. The person who works with 200 workers in a factory also offers leadership.  The students who are in Class 10 and 12 will be holding the position of leadership when the country will celebrate the centenary of independence. Now think, when the country will celebrate 100 years of independence, you will be leader. And will it be good if you inherit a dilapidated system and you are told to lead? Should not we have a strong set-up? Who will benefit if the country becomes strong? Will it benefit a person who is of 80-90 years old now? Who will benefit if the country’s environment is protected? The country will benefit if its resources are properly utilized. Who will benefit if the country’s economy grows?

In 2022, the country will complete 75 years of independence. Many people sacrificed their lives for the country. Many embraced death by being hanged. People spent their lives in the jails of Andaman-Nicobar. They did it for the country’s independence. Independence does not only mean the change in the country’s flag. We become self-reliant, our self-pride grows and we live with self-esteem. What are the duties I should do which strengthens this resolve. We should observe those duties. For example, can we decide that when the country completes 75 years of independence, we will buy everything which is local, will buy Make in India product. We will buy it from outside only if the product is not available in India. Now tell me, is this not a duty, will it not benefit the country, will the country’s economy get a push or not? But if we import ready-made goods and even crackers which we will burst, what will happen?

You must have seen there are some people, who are very aware, they are very conscious of cleanliness. They get up early morning and clean the entire house. What do they do after cleaning the house? They go out and try to find out whether the neighbour is sleeping or awake, and will quietly put the garbage there. They did their duty. But was it in the interest of the nation? No. The people who get up later will realize that somebody has put garbage near their house; they will then throw it somewhere else. There will not be cleanliness because garbage will continue to be littered here and there, because I am not fulfilling my responsibility towards the nation. There are very small issues.  If we don’t allow misuse of electricity, water and don’t travel in trains without ticket.  These are some of the issues. The country can develop faster if we do these things in our life. Now syllabus has been changed. Earlier during our school days, we were taught about civics. But it is our duty that being a citizen we should give priority to our duties. Not only will it be useful to ourselves, but to the society as well. You must have noticed that the new generation will stand in a queue at the airport and will not jump the queue. And if somebody does it, they get angry, because they are fulfilling the duty of discipline. If this becomes our character, the nation will benefit largely.

Presenter –Thank you Prime Minister Sir for your guidance. Sir, Chaved, a class 10 student of Andhra Pradesh’s Jawahar Navodaya School, wants to ask you a question. Could we have the question please?

Questioner – Namaskar Sir, my name is Chaved Power. I am the student of class 10th  JNV Yetapaka. My question is how can we overcome the pressure that comes from both teachers and parents during examinations?

Presenter – Thanks. Amongst us is 11th standard student Karishma from Jammu-Kashmir’s Government Girls Higher Senior Secondary School who wants to ask a question to Honorable Prime Minister. Karishma, please ask your question.

Questioner – Respected Prime Minister, myself Karishma Naina, a class 11 student of Jammu-Kashmir Girls School, Nava Bagh. Next year, I am appearing for my board exam. My question is my parents have some expectations from me that I should score good marks and achieve success. My question is how can I fulfill the expectations of my parents? How can I come out of this stress which follows? Thanks.

Presenter – Thank you Karishma. There is another similar question. Monica Baiga, a class 12 student from Chhattisgarh’s D.A.V. Mukhyamantri Public School, is keen to ask the question to the Prime Minister. Could we have the question, please?

Questioner – My name is Monica Baiga. I am class 12 student of D.A.V. Mukhyamantri Public School, Janakpur, district Koriya, Chhattisgarh. Honorable Prime Minister, how should the parents behave with their children so that they can avoid exam pressure and anxiety? Thanks.

Presenter – Thanks Monica. Sir, please solve the problems of Jammu’s Karishma, Andhra’s Chaved and Chhattisgarh’s Monica regarding the exam pressure.

PM – Is this question for you or for your parents? You think that what you could not tell your parents should be told to them by Modiji. I would like to tell the parents and guardians, I don’t like any pressure and I don’t want to spoil their children that they develop a habit of rebelling against their parents. I don’t want this either.

We must have seen that pulling a steel spring to a limit is useful. But if it is pulled beyond, it will become a wire. Will it then work as a spring? Both parents and teachers should think about it. The way they behave with the child, they should try to find out what is his capability? They should encourage the child. Therefore, my suggestion to the parents, no matter how aged they are, is that they should introspect how they used to treat their children when they were of 3-4 years. You wanted your child to walk. What you used to do then? Standing afar, you would call him to come to you. Ok, now run. Didn’t you do this? Did you put any pressure on your child to run? No. You used to inspire and encourage him, and awaken his inner strength. Tell me, did you slap your child if he fell while walking? Does any mother say that I have been telling you for half an hour and you are not walking and now you have fallen down? How many times should I help you stand up? No. Rather, she claps if the child falls down. If there is some very intelligent person, he will comment, see what kind of a mother she is. The child has fallen down and she is clapping. But that mother knows that he has just fallen down, she has to encourage him. Therefore, I will tell the parents to accept the reality that the children have grown up and they are no longer 2-3 years’ old. You should keep that psyche alive, don’t let it die down, how you used to help your children when they were of 3-4 years’ old. The parents should always encourage their children in all their endeavours and help them pursue their dreams. There is a very narrow line between persuasion and pressure. I will request both the children and their parents to strike a balance. Parents should call home for tea all those with whom their children feel comfortable, be it grandparents, uncles and aunties, or a teacher. And after some time, leave your child with them and you leave the room quietly. Tell that guardian to have an open discussion with the child and find out his interest. He should then tell the parents separately what was the outcome of that meeting, what is going inside the child and attempt should be made to address that. If this mechanism can be developed … Earlier such a mechanism existed due to joint families in homes. India’s child is super politician. If he wants to watch a film, he will go to his grandmother because he knows his father will refuse him. He knows if he has to buy new clothes, he will go to his father, because his mother will refuse him. He knows it very well how to approach family members. He develops this tendency. This does not mean that he should not be encouraged. No. It does not mean this either because Modiji had said not to interfere with them. Try to understand him and tell him what is his strength and quality. Tell him to channelize it. The more you encourage him, the better results will follow. More the pressure, the problem will accentuate. Now parents and teachers have to decide whether to accentuate the problem or turn it into his strength by encouraging him. They should encourage each student, highlight his strength. I will stress on this. 

Presenter -- Thank You Honorable Prime Minister Sir, for being a friend and mentor. We hope our parents are watching this program. Prerna Manwar, a class XII student, comes from a city well known for UNESCO heritage caves. She studies in Jawahar Navodaya School, Kannad, Aurangabad, and joins us with her question. Could we have the question please?

Questioner -- Good Morning Sir. My name is Prerna Manwar. I am a student of class XII science from Jawahar Navodaya School, Kannad, Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Sir, my question to you is that my parents always say that I should wake up early in the morning for study but I am a night owl. I can’t wake up early in the morning. Sir, what should I do? Thank You, Sir.

Presenter – Thanks Prerna. There is a similar question. Honorable Prime Minister, Stanzin, a class 12 student of Government Higher Secondary School from Union Territory Ladakh, is present here and he wants to ask you a question. Stanzin, please ask your question.

Questioner -- Good afternoon Sir, My name is Stanzin. I and studying in XII class and my school name is Government Higher Secondary School and I am from Leh-Ladakh. Sir, my question is in your opinion what is the best time to study? Is it early morning or late night?  Can you suggest us?

Presenter – Thanks, Stanzin. A similar question. I am calling Shubhashish Chakma, a student of Jawahar Navodaya School from Tripura. Shubhashish, please ask your question.

Questioner -- Honorable Prime Minister Sir, good afternoon. This is Shubhashish Chakma of class XI studying at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya under Shillong Region. Sir, actually my elder sister always scolds me because I often go for late night study and cannot wake up early in the morning. Sir, my question is whether I am doing something wrong? Please, tell me Sir, What do you say? Thank You.

Presenter – Thanks Shubhashis. Sir, Prerna, Stanzin and Shubhashish want to know from you when is the best time for studies?

 

PM – What an innocent question has been asked to me? A thought came to my mind from this question. This question indicates that programme “Pariksha Par Charcha” is a success.  It shows that our young generation is wary of asking such questions to their teachers or people from the teaching community. There seems to be some vacuum. I would like parents and teachers to develop a relationship with the students so that they are able to share their smallest problems also with them. The more they open up, the better it will for their development. I am very grateful to my young friends that they have asked me such an important question. But still several people will tell them that you had an opportunity and what question did you ask him. But I give importance to this question and I feel satisfied that today children considered me one among them. The question that they asked me, they could have asked their mother, father, or elder sister. The feeling of belongingness is blissful and I can feel it.  Now it is very difficult for me to answer this question. This is an issue whether to stay awake in the night or wake up early. I am only 50 percent entitled to answer this question. Why I am entitled for 50 percent is that because I get up very early in the morning and therefore I am entitled to speak on rising early. But at the same time, I am not 50 percent entitled because I cannot sleep early due to my work. Therefore, I am able to follow half of the ideal situation. Since, I myself can’t do this, so I do not have the moral authority to tell you what to do. But you also know that the entire day is spent with so much of work, exertion and events. Slowly, these things get entwined. You can imagine how much your mind is engaged in the evening. And if you persist to study late night, will your mind be fresh. No. Your mind will be pre-occupied with so many things. There will be action-reaction of all those events in your mind. It is possible that you won’t be able to focus in the night. But this is true that you feel refreshed after a good sleep. I will not say that get up at 3 a.m. and start studying, because then you will ask your mother for tea at 3 a.m. But if you get up before the sunrise and start studying, then your mind is very healthy. The mind is akin to sky which becomes so clear after the rains. Will it not register better if you study at that time?  Experience tells us and this is the belief globally. I don’t have any scientific analysis. I also believe that the morning is the best time, there is freshness, no fatigue, and if you start the day with studies it is good.  But I don’t think many students have this problem. It is not important whether you have to study at night or in the morning. Everybody has his own characteristics, habits. You should do according to your comfort. Experience says that morning hours are fine, but if you are not comfortable then why to worry? Study at night. Otherwise, you know what will happen when results will come? You will tell your sister that you did not score well as she was not allowing you to study at night and insisted that I study in morning. So, it should not happen.  Secondly, most of the students have this experience. May be, you don’t have this experience, I can’t give any judgment. But when I used to study, it used to happen with me. When the new classes would start after the results, we would promise to start our studies with the opening of the schools. Then, it would be like I will start from next month, or after the first test. But there are some others -- what they do? They decide to study at night. They would tell their mothers not to cook heavy meal which could make them sleep. Pasta will do. Mother also feels that if he has to study at night she would make whatever he asks for – pizza, pasta, water balls, etc. Then you feel that you are not enjoying, so you tell your mother to wake you up at 6 a.m. The poor mother gets up at 5 a.m. and starts making preparation for tea, coffee, or milk. Then you tell your mother that since you did not get good sleep at night, so you will rather study at night. This keeps on happening to wake your mother at night, or in the morning. And we keep on changing our timetable. I think this is injustice to oneself. The problem is not when to study, whether at night or in morning. The bigger problem is we tend to look for excuses not to study and as a result burden the entire family. If we change our habits, it will be beneficial. This is my own experience. Have you heard the sounds of chirping of birds at sunrise or sunset carefully? There is a difference. The tone is different. It means there is some effect of the nature. I think we should adjust our life according to the nature and should avoid any conflict with the nature. Nature itself will help you in your progress. Therefore, we should try to find nature-friendly time. Thank you. 

Presenter -- Thank you Prime Minister Sir for your enlightenment. Honorable Prime Minister Sir, Shaikha Khan from Indian School -- Dar-es Salaam joins us from Tanzania to ask her question. Could we have the question, please?

Questioner -- Good morning Sir, I am Shaikha Khan from Indian School -- Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. At times we go blank after receiving a question paper. How do we overcome such a situation? Thank you Sir.

Presenter – Sir, Shobhit Tyagi is a class 12 student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sector 4, R.K. Puram, New Delhi. He wants to ask you something. Shobhit, ask your question.

Questioner — Good morning Sir. I am Shobhit Tyagi, a class 12 student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sector 4, R.K. Puram, New Delhi. I am from Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh. My question is when we go to examination hall, we start forgetting answers to the questions. I get tensed due to this. Please help me in this regard.

Presenter – Thanks, Shobhit. Sir, both Shaikha and Shobhit are suffering from the problem of forgetfulness during exams. We also face similar situation. Please guide us.

PM – You have asked the right question. Most of the students go through this. Some of the time is lost when they look at question paper. But I want to tell you something in a jovial way.  You must have seen that your elder brother or your father trying to kick start the scooter in the morning when they have to go somewhere. But the scooter does not start. Have you seen this or all of you have cars? You must have noticed that your parent or your brother will move the scooter here and there, or shake the scooter. There is no technology in the world that scooter can be started just only by shaking. But he thinks it will. And what happens? After a while, the scooter starts.  What he does during those 1-2 minutes is not scientific, but most of the people do this. Those who ride scooter, they do it undoubtedly. This is not science or technology, but they do it and the scooter starts. There are so many sports programmes running on TV. Children watch them and it is good. You must have seen a tennis player who would have been an Olympic player. But before the start of the game and there is no ball, he goes to the tennis table and makes some gestures. So does his opponent. There is no ball, but both of them pretend to be playing. Similarly with cricket! No matter how much successful the batsman is, when he arrives at the pitch from the pavilion, he swings his bat as if he is hitting the ball. There is no ball and the game has not started yet. He adjusts his bat. Why? Because, he looks for comfort zone. In the same way, the bowler does the same thing. He does not have the ball, but he runs and pretends to bowl. You must have seen it happens almost in every game. What is this? This is everybody’s own method to bring oneself into the comfort zone. When the question paper is given to you, just think about your father’s method of starting the scooter.  Spend one or two minutes going through the paper and check your pen. This is the simplest solution to avoid stress. Secondly, if you carry your burden to the examination hall, all your experiments will fail. Instead, you should go with confidence. The more the confidence in you, the more composed you will be. There is not a student who has not been taught by his teacher to approach 10 questions in one-and-a-half hours with the easier ones. Don’t they tell you this? Nobody says that you have to start with the first question, then second question, and accordingly. If you find the sixth question easy, try that first to save time. If you start with the easier questions, you get accustomed, and then you can answer the rest of the questions easily. Therefore, self-confidence is very important. Never allow exams to become burden in your life. Secondly, if you are focused then there will be lesser problems. Sometime, what happens is that your mind gets distracted. You look around and find your fellow student is attempting the first question. Don’t look at others what they are doing. You concentrate on yourself, what you have to do. Within a minute, you will start hitting the road. There will be no problem.

Presenter – Thanks, Sir.  Your words are source of inspiration for all of us. Honorable Prime Minister, Abhishek Kumar Gupta, a Class 12 science student from Varanasi’s Central Hindu Boys School is with us and Abhishek wants answer to his question. Abhishek Kumar Gupta, ask your question.

Questioner – Namaskar, honorable Prime Minister. My name is Abhishek Kumar Gupta and a Class 12 student of Central Hindu Boys School, Varanasi. My question to you is sir, I and some of my friends do not have clarity regarding our capabilities and career options. When we think about it, nothing comes to mind. We are good in studies sir, but have not been able to decide about our future plans. Sir, please guide us. Thanks.

Presenter – Thank you, Abhishek. Sir, there is another similar question. Joining us in this chain is Julie Sagar, an 11th standard student from Bihar’s Jawahar Navodaya School, who is keen to ask her question to honorable Prime Minister. May we have the video, please?

Questioner – Namaskar. Myself Julie Sagar, a student of Jawahar Navodaya School, Bihar. Respectable Prime Minister, I want to know from you how we students can analyse our hidden capabilities. Thank you, Sir.

Presenter – Thanks, Julie. Sir, there is another similar question. Irin Dominic of class IX from Carmel Public School, Kerala, is here with us and seeks your guidance. Irin, ask your question. 

Questioner -- Good afternoon Honorable Prime Minister Sir.  I am Irin Dominic, studying in class IXth of Carmel Public School and I am from Kerala. My question is we have to choose the right career, so how will we realize our inner potential. Kindly guide us Sir, Thank you.

Presenter – Thank you, Irin. Respectable Sir, Julie, Abhishek and Irin want guidance regarding their talents and career options. Please help.

PM – Your question is very serious, because it is very difficult to know oneself. I recall an old incident. Once, Lions Club people had called me for a speech. This must be about 40-year-old incident. As it happens, they ask you for your introduction. I was speaker in that programme and there was a chartered accountant who was head of that programme. He also received a letter to send his introduction. He sent a 10-page bio-data detailing everything about his work experience. I also received the letter. Then I wrote on a postcard that you have asked me to write about myself, I am still trying to know myself, therefore, will not be able to tell you right now. Interestingly, it took 10 minutes to read his introduction as against less than 10 seconds of mine. It is right that it is very difficult to know self. But what is the method to know self? We can know about ourselves if we come out of our comfort zone and protective life and take ourselves to a challenge mode, then we realize whether we will be able to do this or not. Whether I have the capability to do this or not! Secondly, we can follow this. We can write a diary for a week and list all the works which we did. Then we should find out which work gave us the maximum pleasure and which did not. If you maintain a diary for a year, then you yourself will realize your aptitude. You will realize which work you can do better and you don’t need the help of others. I congratulate the department staff who have allowed the students to organize this programme and they are doing really well. There is a possibility that after this programme some people may realize that I can also do this work. Their teachers will also realize that whenever there is any such programme in school, we will consider him. Meaning, he gets an opportunity and he prepares himself for this. It will boost his self-confidence and he will realize that he has talent in him. Before this programme, he would not have thought that he could this. But he will now consider that he can also do this. Maybe, he decides to make this a profession. You will see he will read 50 things, will prepare a note of several literature books and think that if he has to go to a function like this, he has to speak this. Will he prepare or not? Meaning, he got to realize his capability. There must have been several moments in your life when you were given such an opportunity. If you get the feeling of success then you should nurture yourself and develop that talent. Secondly, there is no doubt that career has its own importance. Everybody can’t be a saint of a fakir. Everybody has to take care of some responsibilities. And sometimes, we can help the nation by fulfilling our responsibilities. Therefore, career has an important role in one’s life. Just because somebody is good at something, or he does that, so I should also do the same. It will only lead to discontentment. Now you see, if a boy tells his mother that he enjoys cooking and if he goes to the kitchen and observes how his mother cooks. Initially, his mother will feel happy that he is helping her. But after some time, his mother will be irritated. She will tell him to study rather than doing this work and bars his entry into kitchen. But the child knows that he has this talent in him. Suppose, if he puts in great efforts and becomes a popular chef. Then the same mother will say I had prepared him since he was very young.

No work is bad. This is true that his childhood friends may feel that he remains in the kitchen for 2-2 hours. But it may also happen that a small interest may bring about a change in his life. And if he has a sense of social responsibility, he will become a good chef, and may also decide to work on the nutrition of children, what they should eat, how the food should be cooked. Now, tell me, how much important he will become in social service. A person can live his life by traversing different paths.

Secondly, when you sit for exams, be confident.  There should never be pressure of examination, never ever have any fear of exams. Instead, one should prepare for it. If one does not succeed in clearing one entrance test, it does not matter. Lakhs of people sit for it and there will be some who will not be able to clear it. There is no need to build such tension. There can’t be a worse situation than this that one does not put his feet down for fear of it. Our state of mind should be to make every effort to move forward in life. If we fail, we will learn, and will attempt next time. This should be the trait of the student. And a student does not remain student till his student life. Even when he is 24-25 years of age, he is student. One should keep the student in you alive all through your life. The student in you should not die even at the age of 80. This is the best way to live a life – to learn, know and identify new things.

Presenter – Thanks, honorable Prime Minister for your guidance. Nisha Agarwal, a class 12 student from mineral-rich and a tourist attraction, Jharkhand, wants to ask a question to honorable Prime Minister. Could we have the question please?

Questioner – Myself Nisha Agarwal, a student of class 12 of Smriti Vidya Mandir, Ghatshila, Jharkhand. My question to honorable Prime Minister is that the board exams are on the anvil and I am also thinking about UPSE, JEE and PMT. But sometimes, one does not get success in these exams. Please guide us. Thanks.

Presenter – Thanks Nisha. We are very grateful to you Sir that you have solved several of our queries and curiosities. But after listening to statesman like you, we are still discontented. Considering your precious time, I invite class 12 student of GGSC Maluka, Batindha, Hardeep Kaur from the land of five rivers, land of gurus, Punjab, to ask the last question of Pariksha Par Charcha 2020. Hardeep, please ask your question. 

Questioner – Sat Sri Akal, Sir. I am Hardeep Kaur, a student of class 12, Government Senior Secondary School, Maluka, Punjab. I can score good scores in Board exams, but Sir, I am worried and nervous for competitive exams. I want your suggestion in this regard. Thanks.

Presenter – Thanks, Hardeep. Sir, guide Hardeep and Nisha for their queries. 

PM – Sat Sri Akal. My request to all of you is to read my book, not because I have written that book. I will request you to read the book Exam Warriors in these two days of Pariksha Par Charcha, if it is possible. Actually, it is not my book. It is due to all of you that the book has been developed as new aspects keep on adding to it.  You read it twice in the next two-three days.  Then there will be no worries about your next exams once you do well in your 12th exam. What is this worry? This worry is not about your exams. This is about the ambition, a strong desire within you to become somebody. You consider exam as an issue of life and death due to that ambition. If I fail then all my doors for the future will be closed. You don’t have the tension of the success of the exam. Your tension is that you have identified youself with a career that you have chosen and you fear that you will become useless if you are not able to do it. If you read the book Exam Warriors, it has a very simple answer. I often tell about myself that never ever dream to become somebody.  There is always a possibility of disappointment if we don’t become what we aspire to become.  But if we dream to do something, then whatever we do, we will feel like doing it better. So, rather than dreaming about becoming somebody, we should dream about doing something. If you dream about doing something then there will never be pressure of exams. It is just a window, a door which opens up for our progress. But there is just not a single way, there are several means, there are several spheres. If you live with this belief that the entire world is ready to accept your capability, I am sure, you will never experience tension.

I once again congratulate the HRD ministry from my heart. I thank the country’s schools, particularly the teachers. I also thank all the parents who have made great efforts to make this Pariksha Par Charcha programme a success, and to take it forward, and all the states of India have played a constructive role.

Whenever I, you all come here, I see a new India in front of me. Students from different parts of India are here. When the country celebrates the centenary of its independence, leadership will be in your hands.  They are the ones who are sitting here. And when you will be at the peak of your success, and if I am alive and meet you, then I will say with pride that the people who are providing leadership to the system, changing the situation, gifting new things to the world through their works in labs, they are the people who I had the opportunity to meet on 20th January 2020. I will feel proud when the country’s leadership will be in your hands and I will say it with pride that I had met them earlier. What can be a bigger satisfaction in my life than this?

With this satisfaction and belief, I say that exams are not life; they are stepping stones of life. I will tell lakhs of education institutions, crores of children, and children from the world who have connected with this programme through internet and technology, that future belongs to you. It is because of your efforts and hard work that future belongs to India. With this belief, we all move ahead in our lives. My many many best wishes to all of you.

Most of the children must be having this question in their minds and some of them would have given TV interviews regarding the questions they were going to ask the PM and would not have got the opportunity today. I apologise for this as due to time constraint I am not able to give opportunity to everybody. But I understand your feelings. I read your questions, and try my best to connect with you, which I will continue to do so in future also.

With this sense, many many best wishes to all of you. Many many thanks.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, interacted with students as part of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020 at Talkatora Stadium, New Delhi. 50 Divyang students also took part in the interaction programme. The interaction, which lasted for over ninety minutes, saw students seeking guidance on various issues of importance to them from the Prime Minister. This year too, students from across the country, and also Indian students residing abroad, participated in the event.

At the outset the Prime Minister wished all the students for a prosperous new year and a new decade. Explaining the importance of the decade, the hopes and aspirations of the current decade rest on those kids who are in their final years of schooling in the country. 

He said, “In whatever the country does in this decade, those kids who are in 10th, 11th and 12th standards now have a very great role to play. To make the country reach new heights, to achieve new hopes, all this is dependent on this new generation”.

Before beginning the interaction, the Prime Minister said notwithstanding that he attends various events and programmes, the one event which is dear to his heart is the Pariksha Pe Charcha.

As Prime Minister one gets to attend numerous types of programme. Each of them provides a new set of experiences. But, if someone asks me what is that one programme that touches your heart the most, I would say it is this one: PM @narendramodi #ParikshaPeCharcha2020 pic.twitter.com/dC9IYI7ao9— PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 20, 2020 

“As Prime Minister one gets to attend numerous types of programmes. You get to learn a lot in such interactions.  Each of them provides a new set of experiences. But, if someone asks me about the one programme that touches my heart the most, I would say it is this Pariksha Pe Charcha. I also love attending Hackathons. They showcase the power and talent of India’s youth”, he said.

 



Dealing with demotivation and mood swings:

To a question from a student and losing interest while studying, the Prime Minister said most often students get demotivated due to factors that are external to them and also as they try to attach too much significance to their own expectations.

Prime Minister asked the students to find out the reason for the demotivation and ponder over how to deal with it. He gave the example of the recent issue of Chandrayaan and his visit to ISRO.

“Motivation, demotivation are very common. Everyone goes through these feelings. In this regard, I can never forget my visit to ISRO during Chandrayaan and the time spent with our hardworking scientists.

He said, “We should not look at failures as setbacks or stumbling blocks. We can add enthusiasm to every aspect of life. A temporary setback doesn’t mean that we cannot succeed in life. In fact a setback may mean that the best is yet to come. We should try to convert our distressed situations as stepping stones for a bright future”

The Prime Minister also gave examples of how cricketers Rahul Dravid and V V S Laxman batted in difficult situations during India – Australia match in 2001 to clinch victory for India from the jaws of defeat.

He also talked about how India bowler Anil Kumble bowled to India’s glory notwithstanding his injury.

“This is the power of positive motivation”, he said.

Balancing Extra- Curricular Activities and Studies:

To a question on how to balance studies and extracurricular activities, the Prime Minister said the importance of co-curricular activities in a student’s life cannot be understated.

He said, “Not pursuing extra-curricular activities can make a student like a robot”.

But he also said that that balancing studies and extracurricular activities would require a better and optimal time management by the students. 

“Today there are plenty of opportunities and I hope youngsters make use of them and pursue a hobby or an activity of their interest with proper zeal”, he said.

However he also cautioned the parents not to make the extra-curricular interests of their children a fashion statement or a calling card.

“What is not good is when the passion of the children become fashion statements for parents. Extra-curricular activities needn’t be glamour driven. Let each child pursue what he or she likes”, he said.

Whether scores are all that matter:

On a question on how to score marks in examinations and whether they are the determining factor, the Prime Minister said, “Our education system determines our success based on our performance in various exams. Even though we focus our attention on scoring good marks and our parents too, exhort us towards it. “

Saying that there are several opportunities today, he asked the students to come out of the feeling that success or failure at exams determines everything.

“Marks are not life. Similarly examination is not the determining factor for our whole life. It is a stepping stone, an important stepping stone in life. I pray to parents don’t tell them that this is everything. If it does not happen, don’t behave as if you lost everything. You can go to any field. There are umpteen opportunities”, he said.

Exams are important, but exams are not life. You should come out of this mind-set, he said.

Importance of Technology in Education

To a question on the importance of technology and its use in education, the Prime Minister said,

While asking the students to keep themselves updated with the latest in technology, the Prime Minister also urged them to be careful of the perils of its misuse.

“Fear of technology is not good. Technology is a friend. Merely knowledge of technology isn’t enough. It’s application is as important. Technology is a part of our daily lives, but if we misuse it, it robs our valuable time and resources”, he said.

Rights Vs Duties

To a question on what are the rights of the students and on how to make the citizens aware of their duties, the Prime Minister said that an individual’s rights are embedded in his duties.

Giving an example of a teacher, he said, if a teacher performs his duties then he is fulfilling the rights of the students.

Referring to what the Father of the Nation opined on the issue, the Prime Minister said, “Mahatma Gandhi said that there are no fundamental rights but fundamental duties”.

“Today, I am talking to students who would be playing a key role in India’s development in 2047, when we mark a hundred years since independence. I hope this generation takes it upon themselves to act on some of the Fundamental Duties enshrined in our Constitution”, he said.

How to deal with pressure and expectations from parents and teachers?

On how to deal with the pressure and expectations from parents and teachers, the Prime Minister urged the parents not pressurize the students but to pursue with them.

“The way ahead lies in pursuing, not pressuring children. Inspire children to do things that bring out their inner potential”

Best time to study and blanking out during the exam and Fear of Board Exams 

On a question on what is the best time to study, the Prime Minister advised that ample rest is as important as the study itself. 

He said, “While mind is as fresh early in the morning as the sky after rain, one should only follow that routine in which one is comfortable”

On the issue of sudden blanking out during exams, the Prime Minister asked the students to be thorough in their preparation.

“I would urge students to be confident about their own preparation. Do not enter the exam hall with any sort of pressure. Do not worry about what others are doing. Have faith in yourself and focus on what you’ve prepared”, he said.

Future Career Options

On the subject of future career options, the Prime Minister asked the students pursue their heart and work with zeal to deliver for the nation and its development

“Careers are very important, everyone has to take some responsibility. We can always contribute to the nation while delivering our responsibilities”, he said.

Online competition in ‘short essays’ was launched for students of classes 9 to 12 for the third edition of Prime Minister's Interaction Programme ""ParikshaPeCharcha 2020”. The entries for the competition were invited online from 2nd December, 2019 to 23rd December, 2019 through www.mygov.in More than 3 lakh children registered themselves out of which over 2.6 lakh students participated in the competition. 1.03 lakhs students  had participated in the competition in 2019. Selected winners attended Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020 and interacted with Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

A painting and poster making competition were held on exam related issues for CBSE & KVS school students and around 725 posters and paintings were received. Around 50 were selected  and exhibited before the Prime Minister during the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020.

                Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen,  Friends, I am delighted to be addressing a conference on Globalising Indian Thought at a prestigious institution like the IIM-Kozhikode. It is a matter of joy that such well known centres of learning are taking interest in subjects as these. It is no coincidence that we are talking about globalising Indian thought at a time when a life-size statue of Swami Vivekananda finds a special place on this campus. Who can forget the contribution of Swami Vivekananda in globalising Indian thought. Years ago, on 11th  September 1893, Swami Vivekananda gave a glimpse of India’s ethos during his iconic speech in Chicago. As we all know, the moment he began his speech with “Sisters and brothers of America”, there were loud claps. It was magica. The magic was not in the words. What was on display was India’s conviction and commitment to universal brotherhood.  

Friends, Indian thought is vibrant and diverse. It is constant and evolving. It is too vast to be put in a lecture or a seminar or even  books. But, broadly, there are certain ideals that have remained central to Indian values. They are- compassion, harmony, justice, service and openness.

Friends, let me talk about what draws the world to India. First and foremost, what comes to the mind is- the values of peace, unity and brotherhood. So many states so many languages, so many dialects, so many faiths, so many customs and traditions, so many food habits so many lifestyles, so many ways of dressing. Yet, for centuries we have lived in peace. For centuries we have welcomed the world to our land. Our civilisation has prospered when many could not. Why? because one finds peace and harmony here.

Friends, it has also been our strength that our thoughts have become living traditions, guided by simplified and relatable practices. These practices are neither rigid nor …..unidimensional. The beauty in the fact that they can be practiced differently.

Friends, ours is the land that has given the world vibrant faiths such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. In this land the Sufi tradition has flourished. Non-Violence is at the core of all of these. In the 20th century, Mahatma Gandhi championed these ideals and this contributed to India’s freedom. At the same time, they gave strength to millions outside. Be it Doctor Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela or the freedom struggles in many African nations, they took inspirations from Gandhi Ji. Several Indian soldiers lost their lives in both World Wars. They fought bravely even though India had no stake in these wars. We never wanted anyone’s land or resources. But, our soldiers fought for peace. For decades, India remains one of the biggest contributors to UN Peacekeeping Operations globally.

If some of the most conflict-prone zones could breathe the air of peace, our soldiers have a role to play in that. In a world seeking to break free from mindless hate, violence, conflict and terrorism, the Indian way of life offers rays of hope. The Indian way of conflict avoidance is not by brute force but the power of dialogue.

Friends, When I say India believes in peace and harmony, this includes harmony with Mother Nature and our environment.

The Veda Says: यां रक्षन्त्यस्वप्ना विश्वदानीं देवा भूमिं पृथिवीमप्रमादम्

Mother Earth, where saints meditate has been called  the giver of everything, on whom all life forms depend.

Our tradition considers the Earth as our Mother. Divinity in India is associated with many animals. Kautilya has written widely about protecting flora and fauna. We see traces of this spirit in many of the efforts being undertaken today. India has taken the lead in forming the International Solar Alliance, to harness solar energy for a cleaner tomorrow. We are devoting efforts towards increasing usage of renewable energy. India’s mass movement towards adopting LED bulbs has contributed to significant energy saving. 36 crore LED bulbs have been distributed. 1 crore street lights have been replaced by LED. This has led to cost saving to the tune of around rupees twenty five thousand crore. Over four crore tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions have reduced. Energy saving is huge as well.

Distinguished guests, India’s tiger population has doubled since 2006. Today, India is home to almost 2970 tigers. Three quarters of the world’s tiger population stays in India. We are one of the most secure tiger habitats. Back in 2010, the world had agreed to double tiger population by 2022. We achieved it way in advance!

Similarly, the Lion population in India has gone up by almost thirty percent from 2010 to 2015. In 2010 the number stood at four hundred and eleven. Am told today the number is above six hundred.

Friends, India’s forest cover is growing. The number of protected areas stood at 692 in 2014. This increased to more than 860 in 2019. There were 43 community reserves in 2014. Now, there are over 100. These facts are drawing many environment and wildlife lovers to India. You would have seen the Man Versus Wild programme. It led to great interest in India.

Friends, today, Mindful Living, health conscious eating, various types of fitness routines are becoming very popular. Do you know that many of these health practices that are popular worldwide will find their roots in India. Centuries ago, sages from India practised Yoga, and gave the world Ayurveda. Yoga is not merely a set of exercises. It is much more than that. Yoga is a means to both fitness and wellness. It leads to a fit body and healthy mind. The IIM community is one of the brightest but one of the most busy group of people. The excellent work prospects also bring with it stressful routines. I would urge them all to devote time to Yoga. You will see the positive difference it brings.

Friends, one of the most remarkable aspects of this land is the respect, importance and dignity given to women. नारी तू नारायणी  . Women are manifestation of divinity. The clarion call for women empowerment has been raised century after century by Indian thought leaders. Who can forget the Bhakti Saints of India?
Who can forget the role of greats like Raja Ram Mohun Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidya Sagar? Who can forget the efforts of Mahatma Phule and Savitri Bhai Phule?

Even while most western countries took decades to give voting rights to women, the makers of our Constitution ensured women had voting rights from the very first day!

Today, more than seventy percent of Mudra loan beneficiaries are women. Women are making active contribution to our armed forces. A group of women navy officers went around the entire world by sea! That was historic.

India has the highest number of women MPs today. Women turnout in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls was highest.

Friends, India celebrates openness.

Mahatma Gandhi put it perfectly when he said:

“I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any.”

Gandhiji showed it is possible to be proud of our own culture and yet, be open to other cultures and stay in harmony with them.

In this work Bharat Tirtha, Gurudev Tagore wrote about India:

“All shall give and take

Mingle and be mingled in,

None shall depart dejected

From the shore of this sea of Bharat’s vast humanity”.

Friends, where there is openness, respect for different opinions, innovation is natural. The innovative zeal of Indians is drawing the world to India. The idea of Zero, born in our land, is perhaps the most universal and radical idea. It transformed the study of maths. We are a nation with a vibrant young population. Our demographic dividend makes us a magnet for investment. Everybody wants to be in India today. Our software industry two decades ago and our start-up eco-system today shows the power of India’s youth.

Friends, when we are talking about globalisation and Indian thought, it is also important to discuss its application. It would make everyone proud that being rooted to Indian systems and traditions, India is surging ahead on the path of development. You can see it in the manner in which India has achieved remarkable financial inclusion. Or, how we have rolled out the world’s largest healthcare programme in the world.  Or, how India has given crores of smoke-free kitchen to millions. Millions of homes have been made for the poorest of the poor.

Look at our election process. Millions of voters vote peacefully. Polling booths are set up where there is even one voter, in remote areas. No wonder India’s position in the world order is rising.

Friends, Indian thought has given a lot to the world and has the potential to contribute even more. It has the potential to solve some of the most leading challenges our planet faces.

We are taught from childhood:

सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः ।

सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु मा कश्चिद्दुःखभाग्भवेत् ।

May everyone be happy. May everyone be free from sickness. May everyone see goodness. May there be no unhappiness.

Here everyone does not only refer to India and Indians.

It refers to the world.

India believes that when India progresses the world will progress. And, when the world prospers, India will gain by it. I hope seminars such as this popularise more strands of Indian thought among people.

With this, I conclude my remarks and convey my best wishes to IIM Kozhikode.

Thank you!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today unveiled a life size statue of Swami Vivekananda at IIM Kozhikode through video conference.

He was participating in the international conclave on “Global Indian Thought” that is being organised by IIM Kozhikode.

Addressing the gathering the Prime Minister said, “Indian thought is vibrant and diverse.  It is constant and evolving. It is too vast to be put in a lecture or a seminar or even books. But, broadly, there are certain ideals that have remained central to Indian values. They are- compassion, harmony, justice, service and openness”.

Peace, Harmony & Brotherhood

Referring to what draws the world to India, the Prime Minister said, “First and foremost, what comes to the mind is- the virtues of peace, unity and brotherhood. “

He said because of harmony and peace our civilization prospered and survived where many have failed.

“So many states. So many languages. So many dialects. So many faiths. So many customs and traditions. So many food habits. So many lifestyles. So many ways of dressing. Yet, for centuries we have lived in peace. For centuries we have welcomed the world to our land. Our civilization has prospered when many could not. Why? Because one finds peace and harmony here.”

He said our strengths is that our thoughts have become living traditions guided by simplified and relatable practices. 

“These practices are neither rigid nor unidimensional. Their beauty lies in the fact that they can be practiced differently,” he said.

He said India is land that gave vibrant faiths such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. 

“In this land the Sufism flourished”, he said.

Saying that Non-Violence is at the core of all these, he said Mahatma Gandhi “championed these ideals” that led to India’s freedom.

“The Indian way of conflict avoidance is not by brute force but the power of dialogue,” he said.

Love for Environment:

“When I say India believes in peace and harmony, this includes harmony with Mother Nature and our environment, “he said. 

Prime said the traces of this spirit can be seen in several steps being taken now.

He said India led the world in forming the “International Solar Alliance, to harness solar energy for a cleaner tomorrow.”

Prime Minister said in the last 5 years 36 Crore LED  bulbs were distributed and over 1 Crore Street lights replaced with LED making a saving of Rs 25000 Crore and reducing CO2 emissions by 4 Crore Tonnes.

Protecting the Tiger and the Lion

He said India’s tiger population doubled since 2006. “Today, India is home to almost 2970 tigers. Three quarters of the world’s tiger population stays in India. We are one of the most secure tiger habitats. Back in 2010, the world had agreed to double tiger population by 2022. We achieved it way in advance” he said.

Similarly the lion population has grown up 30% from 2010 to 2015, he said.

Increasing Forest Cover

Prime Minister also pointed out that the country’s forest cover is growing.

“The number of protected areas stood at 692 in 2014. This increased to more than 860 in 2019. There were 43 community reserves in 2014. Now, there are over 100. These facts are drawing many environment and wildlife lovers to India”.

Welfare of Women

Prime Minister said, “One of the most remarkable aspects of this land is the respect, importance and dignity given to women. Women are manifestation of divinity.”

He lauded the efforts of the Bhakti saints, Raja Ram Mohun Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Mahatma Phule and Savitri Bai Phule in this direction.

Prime Minister said Indian constitution gave voting rights to women from the very first day even as western countries took centuries to do so.

He said, “today, more than seventy percent of Mudra loan beneficiaries are women. 

Women are making an active contribution to our armed forces. A group of women navy officers went around the entire world by sea! That was historic. India has the highest number of women MPs today.  Women turnout in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls was highest”. 

 

Celebration of Openness

Prime Minister said that India celebrates openness. Where there is openness, respect for different opinions, innovation is natural. The innovative zeal of Indians is drawing the world to India. He said that Indian thought has given a lot to the world and has the potential to contribute even more. It has the potential to solve some of the most leading challenges our planet faces, he concluded

Addressing the gathering Prime Minister praised the illustrious progress made by the magazine in the last 50 years. He however regretted the passing away of its founder Cho Ramaswamy.

Prime Minister said that the magazine was based on Facts, Intelligent Arguments and Satire.

Dynamism of Tamil Nadu

Referring to the dynamism of Tamil Nadu, the Prime Minster said the state had been guiding light for the nation for centuries.

“The dynamism of Tamil Nadu and the Tamil people amazes me. Tamil Nadu has been a guiding light for our nation for centuries.  Here, economic success mixes beautifully with social reform.  This land is home to the world’s oldest language. In September last year, I had the honour of saying a few lines in Tamil during my United Nations address.” he said

Defence Corridor for Tamil Nadu

Referring to the development of the state, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government is taking several steps like establishment of one of the two defence corridors in Tamil Nadu.

“Over the last few years, unprecedented efforts have been put in for Tamil Nadu’s progress.  When we took the ambitious decision of setting up two defence corridors, Tamil Nadu was a certain choice for one of them. This corridor will bring more industry to the state and boost employment opportunities for Tamil youth. “

Textiles and Fisheries Sector boost

Prime Minister said that special efforts are being made for modernizing the textile sector in the State.

“The textile sector plays a vital role in Tamil Nadu’s progress. The Central Government is modernising the sector to help citizens. Financial assistance has been provided under the National Handloom Development programme. Two Mega handloom Clusters are to be set up. Resources have been allocated for machinery modernisation as well.”

Shri Narendra Modi said that the Government is also taking special steps for boosting the fisheries sector.

Fisheries is one of the most upcoming sectors today.  We to make the fisheries sector more vibrant.

“Our focus is on technology, financial assistance and human resource development. Just a few days back, deep sea fishing boats and transponders were handed over to fishermen from Tamil Nadu. Our fishermen have been linked with Kisan Credit Cards. New fishing harbours have been built for fishermen. Help is being given for boat modernisation too.”

Boost to Tourism

Prime Minister urged everyone to visit 15 places in India in the next two years. He said the Government is focusing on Tourism sector and that India is given the 34th ranking in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index of World Economic Forum. He said it was 65th Rank 5 years ago, when the NDA Government took over in 2014.

“I am happy to share that over the last five years, foreign tourist arrivals to India have gone up significantly. So has the foreign exchange earned from tourism” he said.

“You would be glad to know that Tamil Nadu is greatly benefitting due to the Union Government’s Swadesh Darshan and Prashad schemes.  The coastal circuit from Chennai to Kankyakumari, Kanchipuram and Vellankali are going to be made more tourist friendly. “

New India – New Decade

Prime Minister said, “Now, as India enters a new decade, it is the very people of India, who will guide India’s growth trajectory and take it to new heights. I have always believed:  There are two essential reasons that our great civilisation has prospered. The first is India’s celebration of harmony, diversity and brotherhood. The second reason is the will and zeal of India’s people. Whenever the people of India decided to do something, no force has been able to stop them.”

He urged the media to respect this spirit and keep pace with it

“As Governments or media houses, we will have to respect this spirit and keep pace with it. Here, I would also like to appreciate the role of the media. They have taken forward every possible noble mission of nation building be it cleanliness, reducing single use plastic and protecting the environment. I hope this same spirit gets reinforced in the times to come” he said.

                My greetings to all the young friends of Lucknow!  Best wishes to all of you and the youth of the country on National Youth Day.

This day is a day of great inspiration for every Indian youth; it is a day for taking new resolutions. On this day, India had received such a zealous entity in the form of Vivekananda that is still energizing our country, constantly inspiring us and showing us the way forward.

Friends, 

Swami Vivekananda viewed the youth of India as a strong link to a glorious past and a grand future.  Vivekananda used to say that all power is within you, call upon that power. You must believe that you can do everything.  This belief in oneself and turning the impossible into possible is still relevant to the youth of the country and I am glad that the youth of India understands this very well. The youth is moving forward with self-believe. 

Who is leading the new stream of innovation, incubation and start-up in India today?  You all are doing it. The youth of our country is doing it.  Today India is among the top three countries of the world's start-up ecosystem.  So whose hard work is behind this?  Yours; the youth of the country like you is behind it.  Today, India has become the third largest country in the world to create new companies of more than one billion dollars producing unicorns.  So whose strength is behind this?  You, the youth of my country!

Friends, 

Before 2014, there was an average of four thousand patents per year in our country.  Now the number has increased to more than 15 thousand patents annually, that is, almost four times.  Whose hard-work is behind this?  Friends, I repeat, you are the ones! The youngsters like you and the strength of the youth like you is behind this!

Friends, 

Setting up 26 thousand new startups can be the dream of any country in the world.  This dream has come true in India today.  So, the strength and the dreams of the youth of India are behind it.  And even more importantly, the youth of India have linked their dreams with the needs of the country as well as with the hopes and aspirations of the country.  Youth of India are filled with the feeling today that ‘the work of building the nation is mine, it is for me and I have to do it’. 

Friends, 

The youth of the country are creating new Apps today so that it benefits not only them but also the countrymen.  Today, the youth of the country, through technology, through the Hackathons, are using their brains for solving thousands of problems of the country; searching for solutions and providing solutions.  Today, according to the changing nature of jobs, the youth of the country are starting new ventures, working themselves, taking risks with courage and giving work to others.

Today the youth of the country are not concerned with who started what scheme. They are coming forward to lead.  Our youth are leading the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.  Today, the youth of the country look forward to the removal of plastic from the surroundings, homes, neighbourhood, city and beaches.

Friends, 

Today a New India is being built with the ability of the youth of the country; a New India that has 'Ease of Doing Business' and 'Ease of Living' too; a New India which does not have a 'Lalbatti' or VIP culture; in which every human being is equal and every human being is important; a New India with opportunities and an entire sky to fly.

Friends, 

Today this period of 21st century, this decade of 21st century has brought a great fortune for India.  We are fortunate that most of India's population is below 35 years of age.  Several important decisions have been taken in India in the recent past and many policies have been made so that we can take full advantage of this opportunity.  A massive effort to make youth power truly a national power is being made in the country today.  Youth are being helped in every way from skill development to MUDRA loan.  Be it start-up India, stand-up India, fit India campaign or Khelo India, everything is focused on the youth.

We also have an emphasis on active participation of youth in leadership and in decision making.  You must have heard that recently I have got an opportunity to launch five 'young scientist labs' related to defence research in DRDO.  In these labs, the entire leadership from research to management has been given to scientists under 35 years of age.  You would have never heard of handing over the responsibility of such important labs to the youth below the age of 35 years.  But this is our thinking; this is our approach.  We are constantly working to replicate this kind of experiment in every sector and at every level.

Friends,

Youngsters have an amazing ability to find innovative solutions to problems.  This fresh thinking also teaches us to make decisions that are impossible to even think about.  This thinking tells us to face the problems and solve them. The country is also following this thinking.  Today, Article 370 has been removed in Jammu and Kashmir; the age-old controversy over Ram Janma bhumi has ended; the law against triple talaq has been made, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is a reality today.  There was also a mindset in which the country used to sit silently after a terrorist attack.  But now you have seen surgical strikes and air strikes.

Friends, 

Our government is with the youth; it is with the youthful spirits and youthful dreams.  Your success will also accomplish the resolve of a strong, capable and prosperous India.  And on this occasion today, I also want to make a request to you.  And I am requesting you because I trust you.  I urge you to make the country successful under your leadership and this resolution becomes our responsibility on Vivekananda Jayanti.

You all know that the year 2022 will mark 75 years of our independence.  The freedom fighters of the country had cherished the dream of a prosperous India and had sacrificed their lives for the country.  To fulfil the dreams of those great men, we have to do many things.  I urge you today, I urge the youth; I urge you with the expectation to spread the movement across the country. Till 2022, can we buy only local products as much as possible?  By doing this, you will help one of your young friends.  I conclude my speech with the hope and desire that you become successful in your goals and in your lives.

Once again, on National Youth Day, I wish you all the very best and bow down at the feet of Shri Vivekananda, the great son of Bharat Mata.

 

 

 Thanks a lot!

                The Governor of West Bengal, Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar, my Cabinet colleague Mansukh Mandaviya, other Ministers and MPs present here, and my sisters and brothers from West Bengal who are present here in large numbers.

It is indeed a privilege for all of us to be a part of this ceremony being held in close proximity to Mother Ganga, near Gangasagar, which is a historic symbol of the country's water power. This day is very important for Kolkata Port Trust, for the people associated with it and for those who have worked here. I also believe that there can be no greater opportunity to give new boost to port laid development in India. I congratulate all of you my friends who are associated with the Kolkata Port Trust for entering the 150th year of establishment, and my best wishes for the same.

Friends, a short while back, stamps were issued here to testify this moment. Along with this, a cheque of 500 crore rupees was also handed over for the pension of the employees of this trust and thousands of former employees who worked here. I also had the privilege of honouring senior dignitaries above 100 years of age. I salute all such dignitaries and their families who serve the nation through the Kolkata Port Trust and wish them a better future.

Friends, today for the expansion and modernization of this port, infrastructure projects worth hundreds of crores of rupees have also been inaugurated. The foundation stone of the hostel and skill development centre has also been laid for the education and skill development of tribal daughters. I also congratulate all the citizens of West Bengal for all these developmental facilities.

 

Friends, Kolkata Port is not just a place for ships to come and go, it has an entire history behind it. This port is a witness to India getting swaraj from foreign rule. From Satyagraha to Swachchgraha, this port has seen the country changing. This port is not only the place for the freight carriers, but also a place where the scholars leave their mark on the country and the world. Many mystics, on many occasions, had started their journey from this place to the world.

In a way, this port of Kolkata is a living symbol of India's aspiration for industrial development, spirituality and self-reliance. In such a situation, when this port is entering its 150th year, it is our responsibility to make it a robust symbol of New India.

 

Saluting the same spirit of West Bengal and India, I want to name the Kolkata Port Trust, after the father of industrialization in India, who had the dream of Bengal's development and who had sacrificed his life for 'One nation, one law'. Now this port will be known as Doctor Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port.

Friends, Dr. Mukherjee, the son of Bengal, had laid the foundation stone for industrialization in the country. Be it the Chittaranjan Locomotive Factory, Hindustan Aircraft Factory, Sindri Fertilizer Factory or Damodar Valley Corporation, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had been a major contributor to the development of many such major projects. And on this occasion today, I also commemorate Babasaheb Ambedkar, and salute him. Dr. Mukherjee and Baba Saheb Ambedkar, both had given new policies and a new vision for post-independence India.

 

         While Dr. Mukherjee's first industrial policy laid emphasis on the proper use of the country's water resources, Baba Saheb used his experiences to formulate the country's first water resources policy and labour laws. The rapid pace of construction of the river valley projects, dams and ports in the country has been possible due to these two great sons. Both these individuals understood the power of the country's resources, and had insisted on using the resources according to the needs of the country.

 

It was here at a conference in Kolkata in 1944 on the new water policy that Babasaheb had said that India's water ways policy should be comprehensive. It should include every aspect like irrigation, electricity and traffic. But it was unfortunate for the country that after Dr. Mukherjee and Babasaheb withdrew from the government; their suggestions were not implemented as they should have been.

 

Friends, India's vast maritime border is about 7,500 kilometers long. In the world, being connected to the sea coast is still considered a great strength. Landlocked countries sometimes feel helpless. In ancient times, India also had a great power. From the Lothal Port of Gujarat to the Kolkata Port, trade used to take place through the long coastline of India all over the world and there also used to be an exchange of civilization and culture. After the year 2014, new thought was given and work was begun afresh with a new zeal to reinvigorate this power of India.

 

Friends, our government believes that India's ports are the gateway to India's prosperity. And so the government had started the Sagarmala program to modernize connectivity and infrastructure along the coasts. Modernization of the existing port in the country and development of a new port is on a constant progress under the Sagarmala project. Roads, Railroads, Inter-state waterways and coastal transport are being integrated. This project is playing a very crucial role in increasing freight movement through coastal transport.

 

About 575 projects worth more than Rs 6 lakh crore have been identified under this scheme. Out of these, more than 200 projects worth more than Rs 3 lakh crore are under progress and about 125 have been completed.

Friends, the government is trying to make the entire framework of transportation modern and integrated. The imbalance in the transport policies in our country is also being corrected. In this too, East India and North-East India are getting special benefits from schemes related to the Inland waterway and in future, the network of connecting the entire North-East through water is going to emerge as a golden chapter in India's development. 

Sisters and brothers, Kolkata is even more fortunate in terms of development related to water. Kolkata Port is also in the maritime periphery of the country and is situated on the banks of the river. In this way, it is a confluence site for waterways within and outside the country.

         You all know very well that ships have started moving in the Ganga between Haldia and Benares. And I am the MP of Kashi, so naturally, I have directly connected with you. Rapid work is underway to complete the country's first modern Inland waterway.

This year efforts are being made to prepare multimodal terminal in Haldia and navigational lock in Farakka. The work to build the required depth is also in progress for the year 2021, so that even larger ships can run in the Ganges. Besides this, cargo transportation has started on the inland waterway-2 connecting Gangaji to Brahmaputra in Pandu, Assam. Kolkata Port is connected to the industrial centres of eastern India with the construction of river waterways facilities; trade has become easier for countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar.

Friends, due to several steps like development of modern facilities in the country's ports, better system of connectivity and improvement in management, the time associated with the clearance of cargo and its transportation has decreased.

Turnaround time has reduced to almost half in the last 5 years. This is a big reason due to which there has been an improvement of 79 positions in India's ease of doing business ranking.

Friends, West Bengal, Kolkata, farmers, industries and labourers, my fishermen brothers and sisters will be greatly benefitted by the expansion of water connectivity in the coming days. 

The government is running the Blue Revolution Scheme to enable our fishermen brothers to make full use of the water wealth. Under this, besides adding value to this area, they are also being helped in modernization of trawlers. Through the Kisan Credit Card, fishermen are now getting cheaper and hassle-free loans from banks. On the one hand we have created a separate Jal Shakti Ministry, while on the other hand we have also set up a separate Fisheries ministry that will boost this ministry. That is, the creation of these ministries is the sign of where we want to take development and in which direction we want to go.

Friends, Port-led development develops an extensive ecosystem. This water wealth is also being used for tourism, sea tourism, and river water tourism. Nowadays people go abroad for a cruise. All these things can be developed very easily here. It is a wonderful coincidence that the modernization of major centres related to art and culture of West Bengal started yesterday only and today such a big scheme related to water tourism has been launched here.

The river front development scheme is going to give a new dimension to the tourism industry of West Bengal. Tourists will also benefit from the 32 acres of land here when comfortable facilities will be developed for the darshan of Gangaji.

 

Sisters and brothers, not just in Kolkata, the government is building the necessary infrastructure for aquariums, water parks, sea museums, cruise, and water sports also in cities and clusters connected to ports across the country.

The central government is also promoting cruise-based tourism. Our goal is to increase the number of cruise ships in the country, which is currently around 150, to 1000. West Bengal is also going to get the benefit of this expansion; the islands located in the Bay of Bengal will also get the benefit.

Friends, every effort is being made by the Central Government for the development of West Bengal. Efforts are being made particularly for the development of the poor, dalits, the underprivileged, the exploited and the backward classes. Nearly 90 lakh poor sisters in West Bengal have received gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme. There are also more than 35 lakh sisters from Dalit and tribal families.

As soon as the state government will approve the Ayushman Bharat Yojana and the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, the people here will get the benefits; I do not know whether the state government will approve or not, but if it approves, then people here will also get the benefit of these schemes.

And let me tell you that under Ayushman Bharat, about 75 lakh poor patients of the country have received free treatment in case of serious illness. And you can imagine when the poor struggles with a disease; he gives up hope of living. And when the poor gets support to prevent and cure the disease, then his blessings are priceless. Today I am able to sleep peacefully because such poor families keep on showering their blessings.

Similarly, under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, about 43 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the bank accounts of more than 8 crore farmer families of the country through Direct Benefit Transfer. There is no middleman, no cut or syndicate; and when it reaches directly, and no one receives any commission, why would anyone implement such a scheme?

It is such a great help to the 8 crore farmers of the country, but I will always have pain in my heart; I would always like to pray to God to give wisdom to the policy makers. And I hope the Ayushman Bharat Scheme reaches the poor to help them against diseases and I want to ensure the path of happiness and peace in the lives of poor farmers of Bengal, through the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. Today I know the mood of the people of Bengal. I know it very well. The strength of the people of Bengal is such that no one will be able to deprive the people of these schemes.

          Friends, the development of the village and the poor for whom several brave sons and daughters of West Bengal had raised their voices must be our priority. It is not the responsibility of any one person or one government, but it is the collective resolution of the entire India. It is also the collective responsibility and a collective effort. I believe that in the new decade of the 21st century, when the world is waiting for a glorious India, our collective efforts will never disappoint the world. These efforts will certainly bring accolades.

          With this confidence, and with the unwavering faith in the determination and capability of 130 crore countrymen, I see in front of my eyes the bright future of India. And with this belief, let us move on the path of our duty. Let us come forward to undertake our responsibilities. When 130 crore countrymen follow their duties, the country crosses new heights quickly.

With this belief, once again, I wish all of you and the entire West Bengal on Sesquicentenary Celebrations of the Kolkata Port Trust and for the development projects. On this important occasion today, my best wishes to all of you. 

Congratulations!!

 

This is the land of inspiration, the land that awakens the country. From here, we will give out the slogan that covers our dreams loudly. With both hands up, with the fists closed, we will speak with full force -

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi visited Belur Math in Kolkata today, on the occasion of Swami Vivekananda Jayanti and National Youth Day. He also interacted with the monks in Math.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that for the countrymen, coming to this holy land of Belur Math is no less than a pilgrimage, but for him it was always like coming home. Feeling privileged for spending the night in this holy place, he said that the identity of all the gurus including Swami Ram Krishna Paramahamsa, Maa Sarada Devi, Swami Brahmanand and Swami Vivekananda could be felt here.

Recalling his previous visit, when he had taken the blessings of Swami Atmasthanandaji, the Prime Minister said that he was shown the way of public service by the Swami. 

“Today he is not physically present, but his work, his path, will always pave the way for us.”

He said that he got a chance to spend a few moments between the young brahmacharis present there and found that he had the state of mind of the brahmacharis once. He added that most of us are drawn here because of the thoughts of Vivekananda, the voice of Vivekananda, the personality of Vivekananda. But after coming to this land, Mother Anna Sharda Devi's Anchal gives us a mother's love to settle down.

“Knowingly or unknowingly, every youth of the country, are part of the Vivekananda’s resolve. The times have changed, the decades have changed, the century has changed, but Swamiji's resolve was to inspire and awaken the youth. This effort of his would continue to inspire the generations to come.”

To the youth of the country, who think that they can’t change the world by doing it alone, the Prime Minister gave a simple mantra, “we are never alone”. 

For the 21st century, the country has taken steps to build a new India with great resolve and these resolutions are not just of the government, but also of the 130 crore countrymen, the youth of the country, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that the experience of the last 5 years shows that the campaign to connect with the youth of the country is sure to succeed. He said that till 5 years ago, there was a disappointment whether India can be clean or not, and can the spread of digital payment in India could be increased so much. But the youth of the country took command and the change is visible, he added.

He said that passion and energy in youth is the basis for changing India in this decade of the 21st century. Youth confronts the problem, solves it and challenges the challenge itself. Following this thinking, the central government is also trying to solve the decades-old challenges facing the country, he added.

On National Youth Day, PM felt that it is his responsibility to convince every youth, satisfy them about the Citizenship Amendment Act and clear the confusion in their minds. He clarified that the Citizenship Amendment Act is not a law to take away citizenship, it is a law to grant citizenship. Citizenship Amendment Act is just an amendment, to ease granting citizenship of India, for those who were tortured, oppressed, due to their religious faith in post-partition Pakistan. Many leaders including Mahatma Gandhi also endorsed this then. Apart from this, even today, a person of any religion, whether or not he believes in God… whoever believes in the Constitution of India, can take citizenship of India under the prescribed procedures. He said that his Government has also made provisions for the adverse effect on the demography of the North East due to the Act. Despite such clarity, some people are constantly spreading confusion about Citizenship Amendment Act for their political reasons. He said that if not for the controversy sparked by this amendment in the citizenship law, the world would not even know what crimes have been committed on minorities in Pakistan. How human rights have been violated. This is a result of our initiative that now Pakistan will have to answer why in 70 years you have committed this crime with a minority there.

The Prime Minister said that our culture and our constitution expect us to fulfill our duties as citizens, our obligations with honesty and full dedication. The duty of every Indian should be equally important. And following this path, we will be able to see India in its natural place on the world stage. This was the expectation of Swami Vivekananda from every Indian and this is also at the core of this institution. And all of us are also taking a resolve to make his dreams come true, he concluded.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi participated in the grand Sesquicentenary Celebrations of the Kolkata Port Trust today.

Prime Minister  unveiled a plaque at the site of original Port Jetties to commemorate 150 years of the Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT). 

Shri Modi termed that it is a privilege to be a part of the 150th anniversary celebrations of the KoPT a historic symbol of the country's water power.

""This port has stood witness to many a historical moment in the country like India getting independence from foreign rule. From Satyagraha to Swachhagraha, this port has seen the country changing. This port has not only seen consignors, but also the carriers of knowledge who have left a mark on the country and the world. In a way, this port of Kolkata symbolizes India's aspiration for industrial, spiritual and self-reliance"", the Prime Minister added. 

The Prime Minister also launched the Port Anthem during the event.

PM stated that the long coast line of India from Gujarat's Lothal Port to Kolkata Port was not only engaged in trade and business but also in spread of civilization and culture across the world.

 ""Our government believes that our coasts are gateways to development. This is the reason the government started Sagarmala project for modernizing infrastructure and improving connectivity of the Ports. Thirty six hundred projects worth more than Rs 6 lakh crore have been identified under this scheme. Out of these, more than 200 projects worth more than Rs 3 lakh crore are underway and about one hundred twenty five have been completed. Kolkata Port is connected to the industrial centers of eastern India due to the construction of river waterways. And trade has become easier with countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar"", PM added.

Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port Trust

PM also announced Kolkata Port Trust to be named after Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. ""Dr. Mukherjee, the son of Bengal, laid the foundation for industrialization in the country and has been very instrumental in the development of projects such as Chittaranjan Locomotive Factory, Hindustan Aircraft Factory, Sindri Fertilizer Factory and Damodar Valley Corporation.  I also remember Babasaheb Ambedkar. Dr. Mukherjee and Baba Saheb  gave a new vision to post-independence India"",  PM said.

                General Secretary of Ramakrishna Math, Shri Swami Suvirananda ji Maharaj, Swami Divyanand ji Maharaj, respected group of dignitaries, guests, and my young friends present here.

Best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Swami Vivekananda Jayanti, on National Youth Day. For the countrymen, coming to this holy land of Belur Math is no less than a pilgrimage, but for me it is always like coming home. I am very grateful to the President Swami and to all the administrators here for allowing me to stay here last night and I am also very thankful to the Government as protocols and security are also involved. But my request was accepted by the system. And I had the privilege of spending the night in this holy land. On this land, in the air, everyone is able to feel the essence of all the gurus including Swami Ram Krishna Paramahamsa, Maa Sharada Devi, Swami Brahmananda and Swami Vivekananda. Whenever I come to Belur Math, I get to revisit those pages from the past. So, I am here today. And I am able to perform some duties to serve the 130 crore Indians.

The last time when I came here, I had sought the blessings of Guruji, Swami Atmasthanand ji. And I can say that he showed me the way by holding my finger that 'public service is the service to god'. Today he is not physically present with us. But his work, the path shown by him, will always pave the way for us in the form of Ramakrishna Mission.

Several young Brahmacharis are sitting here and I got a chance to spend a few moments with them. Whatever is your state of mind was once mine. And you must have experienced that most of us are drawn towards this place because of the ideas, the voice, and the personality of Vivekananda. But after coming to this land, Mother Sharada Devi's lap gives us a mother's love to settle down. All the Brahmacharis must be feeling the same.

 

Friends, 

Swami Vivekananda is not just a personality but a way of life, a lifestyle. He had considered service to Daridranarayana and devotion to India as the beginning and the end of his life. He had also lived that life and had shown the way to crores of people even today.

 

I am saying with conviction that whether the youth of the country knows Vivekananda or not but they are also a part of the same resolve knowingly or inadvertently. The time has changed, the decades have changed, the century has changed, but the responsibility of fulfilling Swamiji's resolution is upon us as well as on the generations to come. And it is not something that will be finished if done once. This is a work of practice, a work that has to be done continuously, for ages.

Often we start thinking - what difference will it make if I do it alone? Nobody listens to me. Nobody pays attention to what I want or what I think and it is very important to get the young mind out of this situation. And let me tell you the simple mantra which I have learnt from the gurus. We are never alone. We have someone with us that we cannot see. And that is the form of God. We are never alone. Our Creator is with us every moment.

We must always remember Swami ji's words ""If I get a hundred zealous youth, I will change India"". Swami ji never said that if he had a hundred people, 'he' will become something ... He did not say that, rather he said that 'India' would change. That is, our energy, the passion to do something is very important for change.

 

Swamiji was looking for 100 such young friends in that period of slavery. But to turn the 21st century into India's century, to build a New India, crores of zealous youth have stood in every corner of India today. India has the treasury of the world's largest youth population.

 

Friends,

Not only the 21st century India but the entire world has a lot of expectations from the youth of this country. You all know that for the 21st century and to build a New India, the country has taken several steps with great resolve. These resolutions are not just of the government, but these resolutions have been made by the 130 crore countrymen, the youth of the country.

The experience of the last 5 years shows that the campaigns with which the youth of the country gets involved are certain to succeed. There was a pessimistic feeling till 5 years ago on whether India could become clean or not, but the youth of the country took command and the change is visible.

Till 4-5 years ago, many people were not sure about the extent of spread of digital payments in India. But today India stands strong as the world's fastest growing digital economy.

We have also seen how the youth of the country were on the streets till a few years ago against corruption. At that time, it seemed difficult to change the system in the country. But the youth brought this change too.

 

Friends, 

 

Youth passion and youth energy are the basis for changing India in this decade of 21st century. In a way, 2020, the month of January, begins with the New Year greetings. But let us also remember that it is not just a new year but also the beginning of a new decade. And so we have to link our dreams with the resolution of this decade with more energy, more zeal, and more dedication towards its realization.

The resolution of the New India has to be fulfilled by you. It is the youth mindset that says - do not run away from problems; if you are a youngster, you can never think of running away from problems. Youth means - he or she will confront the problems, solve the problems and challenge the challenges. Following this idea, the central government is also trying to solve the decades-old challenges facing the country.

 

Friends, 

 

There has been a lot of discussion in the country and among the youth about the Citizenship Amendment Act. What is this Act? Why was it necessary to bring it? People have filled the minds of the youth with many questions. Many youngsters are aware, but there are some who are still victims of this confusion and have become victims to the rumours. It is also our responsibility to convince every such youth and it is our responsibility to satisfy the youth.

 

And so today on National Youth Day, being present with the youth, I want to say something again to the youth of the country, to the youth of West Bengal, to the youth of the North East, from this holy land.

 

Friends, 

 

It is not that the Government of India has enacted a new law overnight to give citizenship of the country. We all should know that any person of any religion from another country, who believes in India and obeys the Constitution of India, can take citizenship of India. There is no dilemma in this. I will repeat once more, Citizenship Act is not a law to take away citizenship, it is a law to grant citizenship and the Citizenship Amendment Act is just an amendment to that law. What is this amendment about? We have made these changes to increase the ease of taking citizenship of India. For whom is this facility extended? It is for those who were tortured, oppressed, and facing difficulties in living due to their religion in post-partition Pakistan. The lives of the sisters and daughters became unsafe. They faced several challenges.

 

Friends,

After independence, the great leaders like the revered Mahatma Gandhi had said that India should grant citizenship to such people who are being tortured in Pakistan because of their religion.

Now I ask you, tell me whether we should send such refugees back to die? Should we send them back? Do we have a responsibility or not? Should not they be made equal citizens of our country? If they abide by the laws and live in happiness, then we will be satisfied or not? This work is sacred or not? Shouldn’t we do it? Is working for the welfare of others bad? If Modi ji does this, will he get your support? Raise your hands and tell me if you are with him.

Our government has only fulfilled the desire of the great sons who helped the country to become independent. We have done the work that Mahatma Gandhi had wanted us to do. And we are providing citizenship to the people under the Citizenship Amendment Act. We are not taking away the citizenship of anyone… anyone….

Besides this, even today, a person of any religion, whether or not he believes in God but whoever believes in the Constitution of India, can take the citizenship of India under the prescribed procedures. Have you clearly understood it or not? Did the little students also understand? What you have understood, the people playing political games are not ready to understand. They are also intelligent but they do not want to understand. You are sensible and are the youngsters who want the welfare of the country.

And yes, as far as the North East states are concerned. The North East is our pride. It has been ensured that the amendment made in this law doesn't have any adverse impact on the culture of the states of the North East, the tradition there, the demography there, the customs, the lifestyle and the food. So, the Central Government has also made provisions for this too.

 

Friends, 

Despite such clarity, some people are constantly spreading confusion regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act for their political gains. I am glad that the youth of today is also removing the confusion in such people.

 

Moreover, the way the youth of other religions are persecuted in Pakistan, our youth is raising its voice around the world against this injustice. And it is also clear that had we not brought this amendment in the citizenship law, or had it not sparked a controversy, then the world would not have even known what crimes have been committed in Pakistan against the minorities and how the human rights have been violated, how the lives of sisters and daughters have been destroyed. This is a result of our initiative that now Pakistan will have to answer as to why over the 70 years they have committed this crime against the minorities there.

 

Friends, 

Being aware, spreading awareness and making others aware is also our responsibility. There are many other issues about which social awakening, mass movement and public awareness are necessary, like water. Saving water is becoming the responsibility of every citizen today. Be it a campaign against single-use plastics, or the government's many schemes for the poor, your cooperation will help the country a lot in raising awareness about all these issues.

 

Friends, 

Our culture and our Constitution expect us to do our duties as citizens and our obligations with honesty and complete dedication. We have heard a lot about 'rights' during the 70 years of independence. People have also been made aware about the rights. And that was necessary too. But now, not only the rights but the duty of every Indian should also be considered as equally important. And following this path, we will be able to see India in its natural place at the global platform. This was the expectation of Swami Vivekananda from every Indian and this is also at the core of this institution.

Swami Vivekananda too had desired the same. He wanted to see Mother India in a magnificent form. And all of us are also determined to make his dreams come true. Today once again, on the auspicious occasion of Swami Vivekananda's  Jayanti, I have got the opportunity to spend a few moments with the revered saints on this holy land of Belur Math with a great enthusiasm. This morning I got the opportunity to spend a very long time in the room where Pujya Swami Vivekananda used to stay. There is a spiritual consciousness and a spiritual vibe. In that atmosphere, I had lived a very precious time of my life this morning. I was feeling like Pujya Swami Vivekananda ji is motivating me to do more work, giving me a new energy and boosting my own resolutions. With this spirit, with this inspiration, with this new energy, with the encouragement by you all, with the blessings of this soil, I will once again walk the path of realizing the same dreams. I will keep on putting efforts. May the blessings of all the saints be with us! My best wishes to you all. Swami ji had always said - forget everything and consider Mother India as your goddess and make every effort for her. With the same spirit, say along with me - with both your fists up; say loudly -

 

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

 

Thanks a lot!

                Ladies and gentlemen, 

This atmosphere of Kolkata filled with the wave and excitement of culture and literature, fills the heart and mind with joy. In a way, it is an opportunity for me to rejuvenate myself and to recognize and salute the magnificent art and culture of Bengal. Friends, after coming here and watching the cultural programme a short while ago, many old memories of my youth days have started coming back. I had several questions about life, the mysteries of life and its complications; like every youngster has in mind, I used to have such questions too. There was a keen desire to know a lot. There were many questions, and there were so many answers. It was very difficult to find some answers as well. So, we were in search for the answers, to solve those questions and for clarity. And then at that age, this land of Kolkata, this sacred soil of Belur Math used to attract me.

Today, in your presence, as I was seeing all these things, the mind was filled with those emotions again. And while watching this programme, it felt as if I was reliving those moments lived by those great painters and artists. This is my opportunity to salute this wonderful power of Bengal soil and the enchanting smell of Bengal. I also pay tribute to all the people of past and present associated with it.

 

Friends, 

Today is a very important day, a very big day in the field of art, culture and literature of India including West Bengal. The nationwide campaign to preserve India's art, culture and heritage according to the 21st century and to Reinvent, Rebrand, Renovate and Re-house them is beginning from the soil of West Bengal today. West Bengal in general and Kolkata in particular are largely going to benefit from this campaign. I congratulate all the friends associated with the art and culture of West Bengal, and the people of Bengal who are devoted to art and culture.

 

Friends,

Tradition and tourism are two subjects which are directly connected to our identity, heritage and our emotions. It is the effort of the Central Government to put the cultural potential of India in a new perspective in front of the world, so that India can emerge as a major centre of heritage tourism in the world. Heritage tourism will play a major role in strengthening the tourism industry of the entire country including West Bengal. This will also create many employment opportunities in the entire country including West Bengal. To make the Rabindra Setu-Howrah Bridge more attractive to tourists an interactive light and sound facility is also going to be started after this programme.

 

Friends, 

It has always been the desire of the country to preserve and modernize its cultural symbols. In line with this sentiment, the central government is renovating and refurbishing the historic buildings of the country. It is being started from the heritage of Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Varanasi. In these buildings, necessary infrastructure is being prepared for new galleries, new exhibitions, theatre, drama and music concerts. It has also been decided that 5 Iconic Museums in the country will be set up according to International Standards. It is being started from the Indian Museum Kolkata, one of the oldest museums in the world. Apart from this, the museums in Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad and Srinagar are also being upgraded. Friends, not only is it necessary to cherish and beautify these heritages of the country, resources necessary for their maintenance and management will also have to be developed. In view of this, the construction of 'Indian Institute of Heritage Conservation' and conferring it with the status of a deemed university is being considered.

 

Friends, 

Kolkata has been one of the richest cultural centres in India. According to your feelings, efforts are now being made to bring this rich identity of Kolkata to the world in a new form. The renovation work of 4 Iconic Galleries of Kolkata: Old Currency Building, Belvedere House, Victoria Memorial and Metcalfe House have been completed. The idea of making Belvedere the Museum of the World has come up many times. Now our efforts are on the same side. There is also an idea to develop the Indian government's mint as a Museum of Coinage & Commerce.

 

Friends, 

It is not good to have 2 of the 5 galleries of the Victoria Memorial closed for a long time. There have been efforts to open them for some time. I will also urge you to give a place to Bengal's revolutionary contribution made during the freedom movement in the third gallery.

Museums with the name 'Biplabi Bharat' came up, in which Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Aurobindo Ghosh, Ras Bihari Bose, Khudi Ram Bose, Deshbandhu, Bagha Jatin, Binoy, Badal, Dinesh, every such great freedom fighter found a place. Friends, we all know very well what had happened in the decades after independence and the feelings in the minds of the people towards Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Respecting the same feeling of the country, a museum was built in the Red Fort named after Netaji, and an island was named after Netaji in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. On the completion of 75 years of Azad Hind Government, I got the privilege of hoisting flag at Red Fort. There has been a demand to declassify the files related to Netaji, which has now been fulfilled.

Friends, 

In the New Year, in the new decade, now the country feels that the contribution of other sons of West Bengal should also be respected. Right now we are all celebrating the 200th birth anniversary of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. Similarly, there will be another crucial coincidence when India will celebrate 75 years of independence in 2022. The year 2022 will also mark the 250th birth anniversary of the great social reformer and educationist Raja Rammohan Roy. In order to arouse the confidence of the country, it is necessary to carry forward his legacy of trying to contribute for the dignity of daughters, sisters, youth in the society. Let us celebrate his 250th birth anniversary as a festival. It is the duty of all of us.

Friends, 

Preservation of the heritage of the country, this depiction of our great personalities and our history is a major part of nation building. It was very unfortunate that some important aspects of history were ignored while writing the history of the country during the British rule and even after independence.

Friends, I want to mention what Gurudev Tagore wrote in one of his articles in 1903 on this holy land of Bengal. He wrote- ""History of India is not what we read and remember for examinations. Some people came from outside; father killing son, brother killing brother; struggle for throne etc. is not the history of India. There is no description in this history what the citizens of India, the people of India doing back then? Did they not exist at all?”

Friends, 

Gurudev had also given a very important example in his article about turmoil and upheaval. He wrote that ""no matter how many upheavals came, it is more important how the people there faced that in times of crisis back then"".

Friends, 

Gurudev had pointed out that historians saw the turmoil from outside the house. The historians didn't go to the houses of those who were dealing with the upheavals. Now, one who sees from outside can only looks at the turmoil! The historians could not see how the society, the common man had fought against it. In such a situation, many important facts of the history of India were left behind.

Friends, 

If we look at the history and heritage of our country, then some people confined it to the struggle for power, violence and succession. But in the midst of all this, as Gurudev had also said, another aspect of history is very important. Today I want to discuss it with you as well.

Friends, 

In that era of instability, in an atmosphere of violence, it was important to face it in order to keep the nation’s conscience awake; to handle it and to carry it to the next generations. Decade by decade, generation after generation, century after century, who did that work? Our art, our literature, our music, our intellectuals, our saints and our philosophers did that work. And so, in every corner of India, you will find special traditions related to different types of art and music. In every region of India, you will see the influence of intellectuals and saints. These individuals, their ideas, different forms of art and literature, have enriched history in their own way. And you all know very well that such great personalities led some of the biggest social reforms in the history of India. India received the blessings of poet saints like Adi Shankara, Thirunavukkarasara. The path shown by Andal, Akka Mahadevi, Lord Basaveshwara, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, still inspires us today. When Bhakti movement started in different parts of India, songs and ideas of many saints and reformers in that period had enriched it. Sant Kabir, Tulsidas ji, Eknath ji, Namdev ji, Sant Tukaram ji kept awakening the society. There was no corner of India where such great men did not exist in that period. Raja Rammohan Roy ji and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar ji's efforts for social change are equally inspiring today. Similarly, we see Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule, Gandhiji, Baba Saheb Ambedkar and many such personalities enriching the history of India.

Social reform, raising voice against the evils of the society, work on women empowerment were the efforts to keep the nation's conscience awake in those times. And all the names that I have taken, though I could not take many other names, but these people had made literature, art and music as the medium of their messages. This is the power of art-music-literature. They have created history not with the power of arms, but by bringing about a change through manpower. They have shown the power of scripture in front of the weapon.

Friends, 

The soul of any land represents the feelings of the people there. What is said through song, music, art and literature are the same public sentiment! Political and military power is temporary, but the public sentiment expressed through art and culture is permanent. And so, preserving our rich history, preserving our heritage and promoting them are very important for India, for every Indian. This is the kind of wealth that sets us apart from other countries of the world.

Friends, 

Dr. Shyamaprasad Mukherjee had said about protecting the culture- “We are not troubled that the doors of Western knowledge are open to us. The problem is that this knowledge was imposed on us, compromising with Indian culture. The need was to strike a balance between the two in which Indian culture should not be ignored, it should not be abolished"". This idea of Dr. Mukherjee was also important at that time and is relevant even today. We can get to learn something from every culture of the world, but it has to be kept in mind that it should not be at the cost of the values of Indian culture.

Friends, 

Sons and saints born and raised in the land of Bengal have always understood the importance of India's rich cultural heritage, giving it an intellectual leadership. Even though only one moon shines in the sky, West Bengal has given many moons to show the glow of India to the world. Netaji Subhas Chandra, Sharat Chandra, Bankim Chandra, Ishwar Chandra, Jagadish Chandra, Keshav Chandra, Bipin Chandra, many such Chandras have  illuminated the identity of India.

From Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda and Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji, all have worked to awaken the whole world and the whole of India. All these great men told the whole world what India really is and what its real strength is. They also made India realize that our real capital is our culture and our knowledge of the past. Poems by Nazrul Islam and Lalan Fakir and films by Satyajit Ray have also expanded this thinking.

 

Friends, 

You all have the responsibility of keeping the tradition alive in New India, which is done by the soil of Bengal, to familiarize the country and the world with the knowledge and ancient identity of India. This is the right time to create new and competent leadership in every field from here, who can represent India in the whole world. We all have to remember the words of Swami Vivekananda, which he said while interacting with some people at the University of Michigan.

Swami Vivekananda had said - ""Even though the present century is yours, but the 21st century will be of India"". To prove that resolve of Swami Vivekananda, all of us, every countryman should work continuously with full strength. And in this campaign, when the energy and blessings of you all friends, the intellectual class of West Bengal will be there, then the pace of fulfilling the resolutions will increase further. I myself and the Central Government will also try to stand with you at every step, will stand with your every effort, and will also try to learn from you. I express my heartfelt gratitude to you for the warmth with which you have given me an opportunity to come and talk to you on this important occasion today. I will also urge the countrymen to visit these four Iconic places when you come to Kolkata. You should see, contemplate, express and place before the world the ideas of our great men, their art, their feelings and the expressions of the people of that time. Thanks a lot!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi attended the 150th anniversary celebration of Kolkata Port Trust in Kolkata today. On the occasion, He launched the Interactive Light & Sound Show of Rabindra Setu (Howrah Bridge) in Kolkata. He also witnessed an amazing cultural programme at the venue, marking the inauguration of facade lighting.

Governor of West Bengal Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar,  Chief Minister Ms. Mamata Banerjee and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 



The new decorative lighting of the Rabindra Setu has  650 power-efficient LED and spotlight fittings for a programmable multi-colour lighting including a show that will sync with music. The lights will give the bridge, which is considered an engineering marvel, a more heritage look. The new interactive show is expected to help attract tourists and locals.

Rabindra Setu was commissioned in 1943. 75 year anniversary of Rabindra Setu was celebrated last year. It is an engineering marvel as it does not have nuts and bolts, but was formed by riveting the whole structure. It consumed 26,500 tonnes of steel, out of which 23,000 tonnes of high-tensile alloy steel.

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation Four Refurbished Heritage Buildings in Kolkata today. These are Old Currency Building, the Belvedere House, the Metcalfe House and the Victoria Memorial Hall.

Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister termed it as a special day, as it begins a nationwide campaign to preserve India's art, culture and heritage, and to Reinvent, Rebrand, Renovate and Rehouse them. 

Centre of Heritage Tourism for the World:

Shri Modi said that India always wanted to protect and modernize its cultural heritage and structures. It is with this spirit that the Union Government has taken up the endeavour to develop India as major centre of Heritage Tourism in the World. 

He mentioned that five 5 Iconic Museums in the country will be made in keeping with the International standards. This is being started from the Indian Museum in Kolkata, which is one of the oldest museums in the world, he added. 

Shri Modi said that inorder to generate resources, take care of the management of these iconic cultural heritage centres, the union government is considering to launch Indian Institute of Heritage Conservation which would be given the status of a deemed university.

Prime Minister said the renovation work of four Iconic Galleries of Kolkata-  Old Currency Building, Belvedere House, Victoria Memorial and Metcalfe House has been completed. He also said that Government is taking efforts towards developing Belvedere House into a Museum of the World.  

Shri Modi said that Government of India is contemplating to set up a museum of ""Coinage & Commerce"" at the Indian Government Mint in Kolkata.

Biplabi Bharat

Prime Minister said , ""3 of the 5 galleries of Victoria Memorial were closed for a long time and that it is not a good situation. We are now trying to restart them, It is my urge that some space should also be provided for showcasing India's Freedom fighters. I feel it should be called ""Biplabi Bharat"". Here we can showcase leaders like Subhas Chandra Bose, Aurobindo Ghosh, Ras Behari Bose, Khudi Ram Bose, Bagha Jatin, Binoy, Badal, Dinesh etc""

He said keeping in mind the decades old sentiments of India towards Subhas Chandra Bose a museum had been set up at the Red Fort in Delhi and that an island in the archipelago of the Andaman & Nicobar had been named after him. 

Tributes to Iconic Leaders of Bengal 

Prime Minister said in the new era, the iconic leaders and sons of soil of West Bengal who dedicated their lives for the freedom of the country should be paid proper tributes.

""Now we are celebrating the 200th Birth Anniversary of Shri Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. Similarly the year 2022 when India celebrates its 75th Independence, is also the 250th birth anniversary of renowned social reformer and educationist Shri Raja Ram Mohan Rai. We need to remember his efforts in uplifting the self confidence of the country, his efforts in promoting welfare of youth, women and girl child. In this spirit we should celebrate his 250th birth anniversary as a festival of grandeur.""

Preserving Indian History

Prime Minister said that preserving Indian Heritage, India's Great Leaders, India's History is one of the main aspect of Nation Building.

""It is very sad that the History of India written during the British regime had left out many important aspects out of it. I would like to quote what Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore wrote in 1903, ' India's history is not what we study and memorize for our exams. It only talks about how people from outside have tried to conquer us, how children tried to kill their fathers and how brothers fought among themselves for the throne. This kind of depiction of history does not talk about how the Indian citizens, Indian people were living. It does not give them any importance' "".

""Gurudev also said, ' Whatever may be the strength of the storm, more important is how the people who faced it dealt with it.'

""Friends this quote of Gurudev reminds that those historians have only seen the storm only from outside. They have not gone inside the houses of those who were facing the storm. Those who see it from outside have no understanding of how the people were dealing with it then"".

""Many such issues of the country were left behind by these historians"", he said.

""During that period of instability and war, who were keeping up the conscience of the country, who were carrying our great traditions to the next generations""

""This was done by our art, our literature, our music, our saints, our monks""

Promoting Indian Tradition and Culture

 ""One witnesses special traditions related to various types of art and music in every corner of India. Similarly the influence of intellectuals and saints is also visible in every region of India. These individuals, their ideas, different forms of art and literature have enriched the history. These great personalities have led some of the biggest social reforms in the history of India. The path shown by them still inspires us today.""

""The Bhakti movement was enriched by the songs and thoughts of several social reformers. Sant Kabir, Tulsidas, and several others played a key role in awakening the society.""

Prime Minister said, “We must remember what Swami Vivekananda had said during his interaction at Michigan University- 'The present century might be yours, but the 21st century will belong to India'. We must continue working hard to fulfill his vision.

Happy New Year to all of you!  It is an occasion for double celebrations for the Kirloskar Group. It has been a hundred years of cooperation in nation building and I congratulate Kirloskar Group for the same.

Friends, 

The success of the Kirloskar Group is also a hallmark of success for Indian enterprises and Indian entrepreneurs.  The spirit of enterprise of the Indians since the Indus Valley Civilization till date, is giving a new energy and a new momentum to the development of the country.  When the country was under the shackles of slavery, at that time, Shri Laxmanrao Kirloskar ji and such entrepreneurs had kept the spirit of India alive.  Under no circumstances did they allow this spirit to become weak.

It was this spirit that helped the country to move forward even after independence.  Today is not only the day to celebrate the ideas and dreams of Laxmanrao Kirloskar ji, it is also an invaluable opportunity for the entrepreneurs to take inspiration from innovation and dedication.  Today, Laxmrao Ji's biography is also being released and it has a beautiful title - 'Yantrik ki yatra - the man who made machines'. Its release is also a great privilege for me.  And I am sure that the important milestones of his journey will continue to inspire the common youth of India for innovation and enterprise spirit.

Friends, 

This feeling of doing something; this idea of taking risks; this feeling of expanding into new areas is still the identity of every Indian entrepreneur.  India's entrepreneur is impatient for the development of the country, to expand its capabilities and successes.  You must be wondering that at a time when there is a lot said about the world economy as well as the pace of our economic development, how am I saying this with so much confidence?

Friends, 

I have faith in the Indian industry, and on all of you.  The will power needed to change the circumstances and to overcome every challenge, is ingrained in the Indian industry.  And today as we are entering a new year, entering a new decade, I have no hesitation in saying that this decade will be for the Indian entrepreneurs.

Friends, 

The goal of five trillion dollar economy is just one milestone to be crossed in this decade.  Our dreams, hopes and goals are even bigger.  And so since 2014, there has been a relentless effort in the country to ensure that the dreams of Indian industry and its expansion do not face any hindrance.  At this time, the idea behind every decision and every action has been to create a better business environment for every type of entrepreneur working in India so that they overcome every kind of hindrance.

Friends, 

The true strength and potential of the people of the country can emerge only when the government is standing, not as an obstacle, but as their partner with the India, Indians and the industry.  The country has taken this path.  In the recent years, there has been a continuous effort to reform with intent, perform with integrity, transform with intensity and to ensure process driven and professional governance in the country.  The difficulties of the industry have been understood, and efforts have been made to overcome them.

Friends, 

Nowadays Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is discussed so much, but it is not only limited to the return of money in the system.  It is even more than that.  You all know very well that in certain cases, it is often considered wise to get out of the business.  It is not necessary that if the company is not succeeding, there must be a conspiracy behind it, or a wrong intention and greed; it is not necessary.  It was necessary to find a solution for such entrepreneurs in the country and the IBC has laid the foundation for this. There will be a study someday on how the future of so many Indian entrepreneurs has been saved by IBC, preventing them from getting ruined.

Friends, 

You are well aware of the shortcomings in the tax system of India that existed earlier.  Inspector raj, confusion in tax policies, and tax traps in different states had put the brakes on the speed of Indian industry's growth.  The country has now removed this brake as well.  A new system is being created to bring transparency in our tax system, to increase efficiency, to increase accountability, to eliminate human interface between the taxpayers and the tax department.  Today, the corporate tax and corporate tax rates are the lowest ever in the country.

Friends, 

There was a demand for the reforms like Goods and Services Tax or Public Sector Bank reforms; everyone demanded it.  These demands have been fulfilled today due to the thinking that every obstacle before Indian industry should be removed and the industry should be given every opportunity to expand.

Friends, 

Some people put their energy into creating the image that the Government of India is chasing the entrepreneurs with a stick.  To take action against some unscrupulous and corrupt people is termed as strictness against Indian industry by some people. We have tried to ensure that the Indian industry is able to work in a transparent environment without fear, without hindrance, and is able to move ahead, create wealth for the country and for them. Constant efforts have been made to liberate the Indian industry from the trap of laws. As a result, more than 1500 archaic laws in the country have been abolished.  I do not want to go into details of how criminal prosecution was carried out against the entrepreneurs for even small technical mistakes related to company law.  Now many such mistakes have been decriminalized.  The Labour Courts on which work is currently underway, are also in the process of simplifying labour compliance, which will benefit both the industry and the workforce or labourers.

Friends, 

Long term solutions as also short-term measures are being taken simultaneously in the country to strengthen the Indian economy.  Decisions are being taken in the country that will benefit not only the present, but also the generations to come.

Friends, 

During the last five years, the environment of working with integrity and complete transparency is visible everywhere in the country today.  This environment has encouraged the country to set higher goals, and achieve them on time. Work is underway to invest more than 100 lakh crore rupees for 21st century infrastructure in India. There are plans at every level for ensuring ease of living for the people and investing on the human resource capital of the country. Work is going on at every front and several times faster than before.

Friends, 

The 'transforming with intensity' that I am talking about is also visible in the figures. It is the result of working at the grassroots level that in just five years there has been an improvement of 79 ranks in the Ease of Doing Business ranking. The speed with which policies and decisions were made in the country to promote innovation in the country, as a result, the global innovation index has improved by 20 ranks in just five years.  It is also a great achievement for India to be among the top 10 countries of the world attracting FDI for many consecutive years.

Friends, 

The country has undergone another very important change in the last few years.  This change has been noticed in the number of young entrepreneurs.  Today, young entrepreneurs of the country are coming out with new ideas and new business models.  Now even that era is passing when the focus was only on some special sectors of the industry like commodities, mining and heavy engineering.  Our youth today are also expanding into new sectors.  And the special thing today is that these youngsters are coming out of the small towns of the country and are attaining major goals.

Friends, 

There was a time when Bombay Club was said to represent the entrepreneurs of the country and their business interest.  Now if such a club is formed today, it will be called Bharat Club, which will represent different sectors, different fields, old stalwarts and new entrepreneurs.  I believe India's changing business culture, its expansion and its potential, will set the best example.  And therefore, if someone is underestimating the power of India, the power of Indian entrepreneurs, then he is making a mistake.  Today, in the beginning of the New Year, from this platform, I will again tell the Indian industry not to let disappointment get the better of you.  Move forward with a new energy. The Indian government will walk shoulder to shoulder with you wherever you go for your expansion.  Yes, I want to elaborate upon this, seeking inspiration from the life of Laxmanrao ji on what should be your path.

Friends, 

Laxmanrao ji was one of the inspiring persons of the country who pioneered the use of technology and the manufacturing of machines as per India's requirements.  This idea of the country's needs will accelerate the pace of development of India and the pace of development of Indian industry.  We have to make world class products following the mantra of 'zero defect, zero effect', only then we will be able to increase exports and expand our market at the global level.  We have to think about Indian solutions, global applications, and we will have to implement our plans accordingly.  I want to discuss two schemes here.  One is the UPI scheme related to financial transactions and the other is the UJALA scheme to provide LED bulbs across the country.

Friends, 

Today's India wants fast banking transactions, and wants to see the best use of technology.  In just three years, UPI's growing network has fulfilled this desire.  Today the situation is such that the country is making easy and online transactions 24x7.  Today Bhim App has become a very big brand name.

Friends, 

In the Financial Year 2018-19, a transaction of about 9 lakh crore rupees was made through UPI.  Till December, about 15 lakh crore rupees have been transacted through UPI in this financial year.  You can guess how fast the country is adopting digital transactions.

Friends, 

The country needed something that consumed less electricity, was brighter and less costly.  This need gave birth to the UJALA scheme.  Necessary steps were taken to promote LED manufacturing.  Policies were changed.  This reduced the price of the bulb and once people experienced its benefits, the demand also increased.  The UJALA Scheme has completed 5 years yesterday itself.  It is a matter of immense satisfaction for all of us that more than 36 crore LED bulbs have been distributed throughout the country.  Moreover, the programme has been running for 5 years to make the country's traditional street light system LED based.  Under this, more than one crore LED Street Lights have been installed.  Due to both these efforts, about 5,500 crore kilowatt / hour electricity is being saved every year.  Consequently, electricity expenditure of thousands of crores of rupees is being saved every year and there is also a big reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide.  And we all will be glad to know that such innovations originating from India, whether UPI or UJALA, are becoming an inspiration for many countries of the world.

Friends, 

Such success stories and schemes like Make in India campaign are the strength of our industry.  I want similar success stories from the Indian industry in every field.  Several success stories are waiting for you in every sector - be it the Jal Jeevan mission, renewable energy, electric mobility, disaster management, or defence. The government is with you in every field and it is with your every need.

Take full advantage of this environment; constantly innovate, invest and keep contributing to the service of the nation.  With this wish, I conclude my speech and once again I convey my best wishes to the Kirloskar Group and the Kirloskar family.  I also congratulate you on your centenary celebrations.

Thank you.

                Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi graced the centenary celebrations of Kirloskar Brothers Ltd. (KBL) organised in New Delhi today. Prime Minister released a postage stamp to commemorate 100 years of KBL. The PM also unveiled the Hindi version of the biography of Late Shri. Laxmanrao Kirloskar, founder of Kirloskar Brothers, titled ‘Yantrik ki Yatra – The man who made machines.’

Congratulating the Kirloskar Brothers Limited for their centenary celebrations, PM said that this sense of taking risks, expanding into new areas, is still the identity of every Indian entrepreneur. India's entrepreneur is impatient for the development of the country and to expand his capabilities and successes.

“Today, when we are entering a new year, we are entering a new decade, I have no hesitation in saying that this decade will be for Indian entrepreneurs,” PM added.

PM stated that the true power of the people of the country can come to the fore only when the government stands not as a hindrance to India, Indian and Industries, but as their partner.

 ’Reform with Intent, Perform with integrity, Transform with intensity’ has been our approach in the last few years. We have tried for a governance that is professional and process driven. In the last five years there is an environment in the country to work with integrity and complete transparency. This has given the country the courage to set big goals and achieve them on time.

PM said, “In the Financial Year 2018-19, there was a transaction of about 9 lakh crore rupees through UPI. In this financial year till December only about 15 lakh crore rupees have been transacted through UPI. You can guess how fast the country is adopting digital transactions. The Ujala Scheme has completed 5 years only yesterday. It is a matter of satisfaction for all of us that more than 36 crore LED bulbs have been distributed throughout the country”.

“Similarly success stories of Make in India campaign are the strength of our industry. I want success stories from every field of Indian industry”, the PM added.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the 107th Indian Science Congress (ISC) today at University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru.

Delivering the inaugural address, the Prime Minister said, “The growth story of India depends on its achievements in the Science & Technology sector. There is a need to revolutionise the landscape of Indian Science Technology and Innovation.”



“My motto for the young scientists bourgeoning in this country has been – “Innovate, Patent, Produce and Prosper”. He said these four steps will lead India towards a faster development. “Innovation for the people and by the people is direction of our ‘New India”, he added.

He said, “New India needs technology and also a logical temperament, so that we can give a new direction to our social and economic sectors”. He said science and technology provides a level playing field in making opportunities accessible to all and that it also plays a unifying role in the society.

Prime Minister said, “Now the developments in information and communication technology are able to provide cheaper smart phones & cheaper data and that has made it accessible to everyone in the country, where as it was seen as a privilege of the few earlier. This made the common man now believe that he is not distantly separated from the Government. Now he can directly connect with the Government and make his voice heard”

Prime Minister exhorted the young scientists to work in the field of rural development where there are several opportunities for cheaper and better innovations.

Referring to the theme of 107th ISC - “Science and Technology: Rural Development”, the Prime Minister said that it is only due to Science & Technology, that Government Programmes have reached the needy.  

He highlighted that India now stands at 3rd position globally, in the number of Peer-reviewed Science and Engineering Publications. “I have been told that India has climbed to third position globally in the number of peer reviewed science and engineering publications. It is also growing at a rate of about 10% as compared to global average of 4%”, he said.

He also mentioned about Improvement in India’s ranking at Innovation Index to 52. He highlighted that Government programmes have created more incubators in the last 5 years than in previous 50 years.

Prime Minister said Technology is being harnessed at a large scale to achieve the objective of Good Governance. “Yesterday our Government was able to release to 6 crore beneficiaries the instalment under the PM-KISAN programme. This was possible only due the Aadhaar enabled technology”, he said. Similarly he said that it was technology which helped in building toilets and providing electricity to the poor. He said that owing to the technology of Geo Tagging and Data Science, many of the projects in rural and urban areas could be timely completed.

Prime Minister said, “We are continuing our efforts to ensure the ‘Ease of doing Science’ and effectively using information technology to reduce red tape”.

He emphasized that Digitalisation, E Commerce, Internet Banking and Mobile Banking services are assisting rural population significantly. He said Technology can be harnessed for several rural development initiatives, particularly in the area of cost effective Agriculture and Farm to Consumer supply chain network.

He urged everyone to find technological solutions for - stalk burning, maintenance of Ground water tables, prevention of communicable diseases, environment friendly transportation etc. He emphasized that Science and technology has a major role in contributing towards making India a $5 Trillion Economy.

Prime Minister Modi also launched the I-STEM Portal on the occasion.

                Friends, first and foremost I wish you all a happy 2020. May this year be marked by prosperity in your lives and productivity in your labs. I am particularly happy that one of my first programmes in the start of a new-year and new decade is linked to science, technology and innovation. This programme is happening in Bengaluru, a city linked with science and innovation. The last time I had come to Bengaluru was when the eyes of the nation were set on Chandrayan-2. That time, the manner in which our nation celebrated science, our space programme and the strengths of our scientists will always be a part of my memory.

Friends, Bengaluru the city of gardensis now a wonderful field for start-ups. The world is coming to innovate here. The city has developed such an ecosystem of research and development that it is the dream of every young scientist, innovator, and engineer to connect with it. But is this dream only about individual progress and career? No. This dream is associated with the spirit of doing something for the country, making one's achievement an achievement of the country.

And hence, when we start year 2020 with positivity and optimism of science and technology driven development, we take one more step in fulfilling our dream.

Friends,

I have been told that India has climbed to third position globally in the number of peer reviewed science and engineering publications. It is also growing at a rate of about 10% compared to around 4% global average. I am also happy to learn that India’s ranking has improved in the Innovation Index to 52. Our programs have created more technology business incubators in the last five years than in the previous 50 years! I congratulate our scientists for these accomplishments.

Friends,

The growth story of India depends on its achievements in the Science & Technology sector. There is a need to revolutionize the landscape of Indian science, Technology and Innovation. My motto for the young scientists bourgeoning in this country has been -""Innovate, Patent, Produce and Prosper”. These four steps will lead our country towards faster development. If we innovate, we will patent and that in turn will make our production smoother and when we take these products to the people of our country, they will prosper. Innovation for the people and by the people is the direction of our ‘New India’.

Friends,

New India also needs technology and logical temperament so that we can give a new direction to the development of our social and economic life. I have always believed that science and technology has a big role to play in uniting the Indian society and in bringing equality of opportunities. Now, with the development of information and communication technology, as well as with availability of cheap data and cheap smartphones being manufactured in India, have ended the privilege of a certain section. Due to this, even the ordinary citizen has been convinced that he is no different; he is also directly connected to the government and his voice is reaching directly to the government. We have to encourage and strengthen such changes.

Friends, 

This time you have discussed the role of science and technology in rural development, so I will talk about this topic in a little more detail. Rural development has been felt and experienced by the common man in the last 5 years. The strength behind the world's biggest schemes from Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to Ayushman Bharat, which are being praised for effective delivery today, is our commitment to technology and good-effective governance.

Friends, 

Today, on a large scale, science and technology is being used for governance in the country, as never before. Just yesterday, our government had set a record by transferring the money of PM KisanSammanNidhi to 6 crore farmers of the country at one go. How did all this become possible? It became possible with the help of Aadhaar enabled technology.

Friends,

The toilets and electricity have reached every village in the country and to the poor families, only due to technology. It is this technology that enabled the government to identify 8 crore poor sisters whose lives were being affected by the smoke of fuel wood. With the use of technology, not just the beneficiaries were identified, but we were also able to decide in a very short time as to where and how many new distribution centers were to be built up. Today the roads in the village are completed on time, and more than 2 crore houses for the poor have been completed on time, only due to technology. With the use of Geo Tagging and Data Science, now the speed of the projects has increased. With the provision of Real Time Monitoring, the gap between the scheme and the beneficiary is now ending. Due to completion of work on time, the complaints of cost overrun and passing of incomplete projects are also ending.

Friends, 

We are continuing our efforts to ensure the ‘Ease of doing Science’, and effectively using Information Technology to reduce red tape. Today, farmers are able to sell their products directly to the market without being at the mercy of the middlemen. Digitalisation, E-commerce, internet banking and mobile banking services are assisting rural populations significantly. Today, farmers are getting the required information about the weather and forecasts easily through many e-governance initiatives.

Friends, 

We have to broaden the usefulness of technology in the development of India, especially in rural development. The coming decade is going to be a decisive time for science and technology based governance in India. The supply chain network between Cost Effective Agriculture and Farm to Consumer, in particular, will bring unprecedented technology potential. It will directly benefit the village and the rural economy. All of you are also aware that to provide water to every household in rural areas of India, a huge campaign- Jal Jeevan Mission has been started. The strength behind this campaign is also technology. Now it is your responsibility to develop effective and affordable technology for water recycling and reuse. In a way, Water Governance is a new frontier for you. You can come out with a cheap and effective solution to utilize the water coming out of the houses for irrigation in the fields. We will also have to develop such seeds that are not only nutritious but also need lesser water. We need to think of ways by which the data from the Soil health cards that have been distributed all over the country can be used in daily farming work. The most important thing is that technical solutions are imperative to protect our farmers from losses in the supply chain.

Friends,

 

Another important link in the economy of the village is our Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises i.e. MSME. In the changing times, their strength is also connected to all of you, friends. Now consider the use of single-use plastic. The country has resolved to achieve liberation from single-use plastic so that we can save our environment, our animals, our fish and our soil. But you have to find cheap and durable plastic and some new alternative. Whether it is metal, clay or fiber, an alternative to plastic will come out of your laboratory itself. Besides Plastic Waste, we also need new technology, new solutions to remove and reuse metal from Electronic Waste.

The solutions that you will provide, the small industries, our clay artists and wood artists will be able to place them in the market. This will save the environment and will also develop our small scale industries.

Friends,

For the green, circular and sustainable economy in the villages, there is a wide scope for dedicated start-ups in the rural economy. The residues of crops and the waste coming out of the houses are also creating a challenge in terms of pollution and filth. We will have to make quick efforts to convert this waste into wealth. We are trying to reduce crude oil imports by at least 10 per cent by the year 2022. Hence, there is a lot of potential for Start-Ups in the bio-fuel ethanol manufacturing sector.

 

In such a situation, we need to encourage industry-based research. We have to develop dialogue between every stake holder. Remember, your contribution will play a huge role in making India a $ 5 trillion economy.

Friends, There is a need for revolution in technologies assisting agricultural practices. Can we find farmer-centric solutions to the problem of stalk burning for instance? Can we also redesign our brick kilns for reduced emissions and greater energy efficiency? We need to find better and faster solutions to the problem of clean drinking water supplies around the country. How do we prevent effluents and discharge from industries from ruining our soil and our groundwater tables for years to come?

Friends,

Another important point I wish to make is the significance of “Make in India” in medical devices to bring the fruits of advances in diagnostics to our people. 

Mahatma Gandhi once said, “It is health that is the real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.” To promote well-being, we should not only practice some of the tested traditional wisdom, but also continuously enlarge its scope by introducing the modern tools and concepts of contemporary biomedical research.

Our vision should be to protect people from the threats of dangerous communicable diseases like Nipah, Ebola, etc. We must work overtime to fulfil the promise to eradicate Tuberculosis by 2025. Globally, India is the leader in the supply of vaccines. We aim to develop India as a world-class, US$100 billion Bio-manufacturing hub by 2024. This will happen with right policy initiatives and support to innovative research, human resource development and entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Friends,

India must also develop a long term roadmap for sustainable and environment friendly transportation and energy storage options. The latter becomes increasingly significant for grid management as we expand our renewal energy supply. These require developing new battery types which are based on earth abundant, environmentally benign materials which are not monopolistic, are affordable on 100s of giga watt scales, and suitable for tropical climates.

Friends, The economic and social benefits of accurate weather and climate forecasting are immense. There have been considerable improvements in weather forecast and warning services especially in case of Tropical cyclones. This is evident from large reduction in casualties. Our successes in space exploration should now be mirrored in the new frontier of the deep sea. We need to explore, map and responsibly harness the vast oceanic resources of water, energy, food and minerals. This requires developing deep strengths in manned submersibles, deep sea mining systems and autonomous underwater vehicles. This, I hope will be made possible by a ‘Deep Ocean Mission’ being formulated by the Ministry of Earth Sciences.

Friends,

I have learned from the scientists that the potential energy, the silent form of energy, can move mountains by its conversion to the kinetic energy of motion. Can we build a Science in Motion? Imagine the enormous impact of a full translation of our scientific potential into an unprecedented socio-economic development through relevant technologies, innovations, startups and industry. Can we have this high pressure steam drive a high speed engine of Science & Technology to navigate and connect the new India of opportunities?

Friends,

Technology is the bridge between the government and the common man. Technology balances fast growth and right development. Technology has no bias. It is neutral. This is the reason when the coordination of Human Sensitivity and Modern Technology increases, we get unprecedented result. I am confident that in the New Year, in the new decade, we will be able to further strengthen the new attitude and new approach of New India. Once again, Happy New Year to all of you, the entire scientific community and your family. Thanks a lot!

                The Chief Minister of Karnataka Mr. Yeddyurappa ji, Chairman of DRDO Dr. G. Satish Reddy, other top officials of DRDO, Members of Apex Committees, Lab Directors of Young Scientists!

Friends, 

First of all - a very Happy New Year to all of you! Happy New Year! Coincidentally, a short while back I was at a farmers' programme in Tumkur; and now I am here amidst all the young friends of the country who are associated with research! And tomorrow I have to attend the Science Congress. In a way, my Karnataka visit and that too my first visit in 2020 is dedicated to the spirit of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan and Jai Anusandhan' and to the spirit of New India. And it is also a matter of great pride for all of us that this event is being held at the Aeronautical Development Establishment with which the most revered Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, was associated in DRDO.

Friends, 

This decade is as important as New India; because with 2020 a new decade has started and not just a new year. And what will be India's strength in the coming years? This decade is also going to decide what will be our position in the world? This decade is entirely of young dreams and our young innovators, especially the ones who were either born in the 21st century or attained adolescence in the 21st century. When I urged DRDO to rethink and reshape itself, the idea behind it was that one must work with new energy to meet the challenges of the 21st century. However, it does not mean that the person who turned 36 has become useless. That means, if we seek the support of those less than 35 years of age for the ones who have worked hard for 60 years, 50 years, 55 years, then the world will be able to see a New India. Without the strength of these old experienced people, it is not possible for the new young people to rise. And so it is very important to have a combination. And I also have a personal experience behind this idea. I have come very late in political life and initially I used to look after my party's organization and look after elections etc. So when I started in Gujarat, I was entrusted with the responsibility of the first major election. I was quite new, and at that time newspapers had written these things in great detail. At that time about 90 people worked in my office, in my management. The entire election was fought across the state but the office management had around 90 people. And those who had come as Volunteers were to work for 2-3 months. The newspapers had found out that the average age of this entire team of 90 people was 23. That means I was in that average age group of 23 years and had organized and contested elections. And we were victorious for the first time.

The young people have a lot of restricting capacity. For instance, suppose you are a very good kabaddi player, and you have played kabaddi for 20 years in your life. You have played at National, and International levels. No matter how good you were then but after attaining the age of 60-70 years if you go and watch a kabaddi match you will feel scared looking at a young kabaddi player and think he might be hurt. You have played kabaddi all your life and have faced everything, yet when you see any 18-20 year old man with swift and fast movement you are afraid that he might be injured. You had done the same thing yourself but are not able to see that now. This psychology works. There is a difference between a young mind and an experienced mind. And so how can we combine the use of both the minds in DRDO to accept the challenges of the world? Sometimes a small plant is not able to grow under a very big tree. The fault is not of the big tree. The plant too feels that it should remain so in front of the big tree. Nobody is to blame. But if the same plant is left in the open, then the big tree will also be proud to see it grow along with it. That's why we have started these five labs for this same purpose. And I want them to make mistakes. Let these five Labs exhaust the entire budget. When a scientist sacrifices his life completely, then the country gains something. The funds do not matter before your life and sacrifice. And why will the government step back in investing the money?     

I am glad that the suggestion of setting up 5 Labs in the field of Advanced Technologies was seriously worked out and today 5 such institutes are coming up in Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai. And I believe that these Young Scientists’ Labs will give new wings to the thoughts and ideas of young scientists. It means that now it will be recognized as ‘DRDO-Y’ but while speaking, it will sound as ‘DRDO-Why’ and I believe that these five labs have the power to respond to DRDO-why. And we all have to strengthen it together. The results from these labs will determine the intensity of our national effort for Advanced Technologies. These labs will help in shaping the nature of research and development in the field of emerging technologies in the country.

And yes, my young scientists! I would like to tell these young friends that these labs will not test only technology. Some times we think that the technology has advanced two steps or five steps. It is not about only technology. It is also going to test my young scientists’ temperament and patience and this is the greatest parameter.

You must always keep in mind that it is only with your efforts and constant practice that India will lead the way to success. Only positivity or purpose should be your source of inspiration. You always have to keep this in mind that the responsibilities of making the lives of 130 crore Indians safe and easy are on your shoulders.

Friends, 

Today's event is just the beginning. It's not just one year but an entire decade that lies before you. What should be the medium and long term roadmap for DRDO in this decade should be considered very seriously. And I want to give you one more suggestion. These five labs will have people with the age group of 35 years and below but what will happen when this team turns 36? I want to assure the people that these 5 labs will be allowed to turn 45 or 55 and so on. But you have to create five new labs with people of the same age of up to 35 years. You do not have to maintain the age of 35, let this lab turn 40, 45 etc but we will have five new labs with people up to 35 years. When they cross 35, then we will come up with 5 new labs and this chain will continue. If this chain does not continue, then the 32 year old man here will be scared as to what will happen to him after 3 years? His dream will fall apart. Therefore, leave the responsibility of these labs to them till they retire. Let these people turn fifty, fifty five, and sixty. Make 5 new labs with fresh under-35 people. And this chain should go on. Then you will see that a new atmosphere of freshness will constantly be created. And this will ultimately benefit us. And we should not stop just at that idea. The programme should also start at the actionable point within the stipulated time.

I want to see DRDO at a height where it determines not only the direction and condition of scientific institutions of India, but also that of the world. And I am saying with a great conviction that DRDO and our young labs can also become a source of inspiration for the world and other major institutions. There is a solid reason why I am saying this, and the reason is the history of DRDO, the performance of DRDO and the trust of country on DRDO.

Friends, 

Today the country's finest scientific minds are in DRDO. The achievements of DRDO are endless. The exhibition I have just seen showcased not only your current achievements but also your future plans and projects. And the youngsters explained in such a simple language that even I could understand. I felt like I could do that too. Otherwise, in school I could not understand anything. Today you have explained well. You have made India's missile programme among the most outstanding programmes of the world. And the previous year has given a new direction to India's strength in the field of space and air defence. Successful testing of state-of-the-art space technology in the form of ASAT will certainly define the capability of 21st century India.

Due to your efforts, today India is one of the very few countries that have the capability to manufacture everything from aircrafts to aircraft carriers. But is that enough? No, friends! And you must have seen that at home, a child who does good work is pestered by the parents to do more. If he does five things, then parents would ask him to do seven. If he does seven things, then parents would ask him to do ten. On the other hand, if someone does nothing, then everyone would say- hey, leave him… he will not do that. So the problem is that people will keep giving you work.

 

See, Ramcharitmanas has a great saying. Ramcharitmanas states- 

 

कवन जो काम कठिन जग माहीं।

जो नहिं होइ तात तुम्‍ह पाहीं।।

 

That means, what is that work on this earth, which you cannot do? You can do everything, nothing is difficult for you. Like when Ramcharitmanas was created, did anyone know that DRDO would come into existence sometime in the future? I would like to repeat the same for DRDO. Your abilities are limitless and you can do so much! Expand the scope, change the parameters of your performance, open your wings to the full potential and show your courage to rule the sky. You have the opportunity and I am with you.

As the Prime Minister of the country, I am standing in front of you and saying that India is ready to walk shoulder to shoulder with you, the scientists and the innovators of the country. You are all well aware of the fact that in the future, besides Air and Sea, Cyber ​​and Space will also decide the strategic dynamics of the world. In addition, intelligent machines are capable of playing an important role in defence security mechanisms in the future. In such a situation, India cannot be left behind by anyone. Investment in future technology is necessary and innovation is also necessary to protect its citizens, its borders and its interests.

I am sure that you will leave no stone unturned to fulfil the requirements and aspirations of New India, and I would also say that your expansion should not be limited to India only. An institution like DRDO can give a lot to humanity in the world. You can play a crucial role towards world security. Today, there are several countries of the world which are not at risk of attacks at the borders. There are all friendly countries in the neighbourhood.   Even these countries, which had never thought that they would have to lift a gun because there was never a threat of war in the neighbourhood are now being hit by terrorism. The borders were safe, quiet, open and full of love, but those countries have also been hit by terrorism. They too had to pick up guns.

DRDO can also contribute to upgrading the internal security in such countries. The needs of the people that I meet from the small countries have increased so much. Apart from the limited resources, they will have to think something new for dealing with these threats. We can guarantee the safety of such people by holding their hands. This will be a humanitarian work. And every such thing you do will be of great service to humanity and will also strengthen India's role on the world arena.

Friends, 

In the field of defence manufacturing, DRDO will have to come up with new innovations to make India self-reliant. DRDO's innovations play a huge role in strengthening Make in India and promoting a vibrant Defence Sector in the country. And therefore, we should constantly try to ensure that we are completely self-reliant from design to development. We have to develop an ecosystem where there is a total focus on integration and innovation.

Friends, 

Today India is moving rapidly towards new reforms in the field of defence. Conditions are changing rapidly in the world and Technology continues to dominate the scenario. In such a situation, India cannot rely only on old systems. We cannot face the 2st century with the 19th century systems. Just this week, the Chief of Defence Staff has also been appointed by the government. This CDS is going to bring a sweeping change. He is directly related to DRDO. The need for such an arrangement was felt years ago for a better coordination, connection and synergy among the three forces in India. This post was a commitment of our government to the country, which we have fulfilled.

Friends, 

We have to constantly strengthen ourselves in tune with this phase of change. This is the expectation of the country from us and this is the vision behind the establishment of Young Scientists’ Labs. Today, we will not only deal with future Technological challenges, but will also infuse new energy into the work culture of DRDO. With this expectation, once again, my best wishes to you all!

Happy New Year to you and your family once again!

 

Thanks a lot!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation 5 Young Scientists Laboratories of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), in Bengaluru today.

DRDO Young Scientist Laboratories (DYSLs) are located in five cities viz, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. Each lab will work on a key advanced technology of importance to the development of futuristic defence systems viz, Artificial intelligence, Quantum technologies, Cognitive technologies, Asymmetric technologies and Smart materials.

The inspiration to start such laboratories came from the Prime Minister on the occasion of DRDO award function held on August 24, 2014. Shri Narendra Modi had then asked DRDO to empower the youth, by giving them decision making powers and challenging research opportunities.

Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said these labs would help in

shaping the pattern of research and development in the field of emerging technologies in the country.

Prime Minister asked the scientists to prepare a definite roadmap for the new decade where DRDO should be able to set the direction and pace of scientific research in various fields in India.

Addressing the scientists, Prime Minister said India’s Missile programme is one of the outstanding programmes in the world. He also appreciated the Indian Space Programme and air defence systems.

Prime Minister said India cannot be left behind in the field of scientific research. He said the  Government is willing to walk the extra mile with the scientific community so that it can invest time in emerging technologies and innovations for national security.

He said DRDO's innovations would play a huge role in strengthening programmes like Make in India and in promoting a vibrant defence sector in the country.

The establishment of the five DRDO Young Scientist Labs lays down the foundation for research and development of futuristic technologies. It will be a big leap forward for DRDO  from the goal of making India self reliant to future ready in defence technologies.

Research in the area of rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence will be carried out at Bengaluru. The all-important area of Quantum Technology will be based out of IIT Mumbai. The future is dependent on Cognitive Technologies and IIT Chennai will house the lab embarking in this area of research. New and futuristic area of Asymmetric Technologies, which will change the way wars are fought, will be based out of the campus of Jadavpur University, Kolkata. The research in the hot and critical area of Smart Materials and their applications will be based out of Hyderabad.

                Greetings to all of you! First of all, Happy New Year to all! Also, my best wishes to you on the harvest festival Sankranti.

Shri Yediyurappa ji, the popular Chief Minister of Karnataka, my cabinet colleague Shri Narendra Singh Tomar ji, who is running the agrarian movement in the country, Shri Sadanand Gowda ji, Shri Prahlad Joshi ji, Chief Minister of Manipur Shri N. Biren Singh, Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat ji,  other central Ministers and the Ministers from the Government of Karnataka, the MPs, MLAs, all the delegates from other states of the country and my peasant brothers gathered here in large numbers.

It is a great privilege for me to start the New Year and the new decade with a meeting with the Annadata - our peasant brothers and sisters. On behalf of the 130 crore countrymen, I wish every farmer of the country a very happy new year, and thank the farmers who produce food for the country. It is the hard work of the farmers, due to which food production in India is at a record level today.

Today I have got an opportunity to honour my farmer companions and their states which are advancing the agricultural sector of the country. I congratulate all the farmers who have received Krishi Karman Award, and their efforts are commendable.

Today, the fishermen from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have been given deep sea fishing boats and transponders. I also congratulate all my fishermen friends for the same.

 

Friends, 

Besides the Krishi Karman Award, this land of Karnataka has become a witness to another historical achievement. Today, under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, money has been deposited in the account of 8th crore farmer friend. Accomplishing this in such a short time is a big thing. Moreover, today, 12 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the account of 6 crore farmer families of the country at the same time.

Friends, 

There was also a period in the country when only 15 paise reached the poor, if one rupee was sent to him. The rest of the 85 paise used to be taken away by the middlemen.

Today, 

Every penny of the funds sent is directly reaching the accounts of the poor. I congratulate the state governments across the country, including Karnataka, for identifying the beneficiary farmers at a rapid pace.

In the New Year, I hope that those states, which are not implementing PM Kisan Samman Yojana, will definitely join the scheme this year. The mindset that ‘a particular scheme belongs to that party and not ours’ or ‘if we implement this scheme, that party will benefit’ has done a lot of harm to the people of the country.

This kind of politics never allowed the farmers of the country to become strong.

Our government understood your requirements, your concerns and needs. We looked at agriculture as a whole, and not in isolation, and worked together for fighting the challenges related to this sector.

Friends, there had been hundreds of irrigation projects that were in a limbo for decades. We have always given priority to the interests of farmers be it changes in laws related to crop insurance, soil health cards or 100 per cent neem coating of urea. For many years, farmers have been demanding that the MSP be increased by one and a half times the cost. Our government has also taken this historic decision.

Brothers and sisters, 

Apart from addressing your current needs, our focus is also on your future needs. The capacity of cold storage is being increased throughout the country, so that the farmers do not have the problems of storage of grains, fruits and flowers. The e-Nam network is being expanded to enable farmers to sell their crops in the electronic market in any part of the country.

Friends,

A vaccination campaign has been launched at the national level to combat Foot and Mouth Diseases of animals so that farmers have minimum expenditure on treatment of animals. PM Kusum Yojana has been launched to enable farmers to generate solar power in their fields and sell it to the national grid.

Friends, 

The agriculture sector of the country has a huge role in turning India's economy to a $ 5 trillion economy. Our government is insisting on creating Cash crop-centric and Export-centric farming system for the same.

When it comes to export of agricultural products, south India has played an important role since ancient times. The weather here, the soil here and easy connectivity to the world through the sea have been the reasons for the same. We want to make this power of South India also the power of Agro Export of New India.

Brothers and sisters,

Be it Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra, Telangana, or Tamil Nadu, there is a huge scope for processing and export of products related to Horticulture and Spices. This is the reason why special action plans are being made through the Agricultural and Processed Products Export Development Authority. Karnataka has also benefited from this.

Special clusters have been identified by the government to promote the pomegranates of Belgaum and Mysore, pink onions of Chikkaballapura and Bengaluru, and coffee and red chillies of Chikkamangaluru, Kodagu and Hassan. Our effort is to identify the specific product of each block and district and develop export facilities by value addition.

Friends, 

Due to the efforts of our government, both the production and export of spices by India has increased considerably. In India, spice production has increased by more than 25 lakh tonnes, so exports have also increased from about 15 thousand crore Rupees to about 19 thousand crore Rupees.

Among spices, if we talk about turmeric, then the efforts of the government have tremendously increased the export of turmeric in the last 5 years. The government is promoting research on new and improved turmeric seeds. Telangana has emerged as a hub for turmeric, but we are also pushing turmeric production in other states including Karnataka.

Brothers and sisters, 

The cultivation of coconut, cashew, coffee and rubber in South India has also been flourishing for years. In view of the demand for coconut in the country and the world, the government is taking care of it among other things to ensure that the farmers associated with coconut cultivation get a fair price. Associations related to coconut farmers have been formed and societies are also being formed for the same. I have been told that in Karnataka itself, about 550 such institutes related to coconut farmers have been formed.

Friends, 

We have a lot of potential to expand cashew plantations here. The government is trying to provide best quality cashew plants to the farmer and gardener brothers and sisters.

Similarly, efforts are also being made on a large scale to increase the area of ​​rubber production. Our first goal should be to produce rubber here as per the requirement of the country so that we do not have to depend on imports. I am told that the Rubber Board is training many youths here under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana. It will certainly benefit the rubber farmers and industries.

Friends, 

Coffee gardens are the pride of South India including Karnataka. The government's effort is to strengthen the value chain of coffee. Therefore, Integrated Coffee Development Programme has been launched. Under this programme, special support and encouragement has been given to the entire system ranging from coffee production to packaging in the last 2-3 years. Assistance in marketing is being provided to small producers, self-help groups, and cooperatives.

Friends, 

Apart from Horticulture, South India also has a larger share in the production of pulses, oil and coarse grains. Seed hubs have been built to promote pulses production in India, of which more than 30 centers are located in Karnataka, Andhra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. Similarly, new hubs have also been created in the country for coarse grains, 10 of which are in South India.

Friends, 

There is a lot of potential to increase exports in the fisheries sector of South India. The government is working at three levels to strengthen the fisheries sector.

First: by encouraging fisheries in villages, and providing financial assistance to fishermen and siblings.

Second: by modernization of boats under the Blue Revolution Scheme.

And third: by the construction of modern infrastructure associated with the trade and business of fish.

Brothers and sisters, 

Fishermen have also been linked to the Kisan Credit Card facility. New fishing harbours are being built in large rivers and in the sea for the convenience of fish farmers. A special fund of Rs.7000 crores has also been created for modern infrastructure.

For the modernization of boats by the government, more than Rs 2500 crore has been given to the states under the Blue Revolution Scheme. Fishermen's boats are being modernized for deep sea fishing and navigation devices are being installed in boats for the protection of fishermen with the help from ISRO. Today, you have also seen many farmers of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka taking advantage of this provision.

Friends, 

To tackle the situation of water crisis across India including Karnataka, the government has pledged to deliver water to every household under the Jal Jeevan Mission. A few days ago, another campaign has been started in this direction. The name of this campaign is Atal Bhujal Yojana. Under this, steps are being taken to raise the level of groundwater in 7 states of the country including Karnataka.

Brothers and sisters, 

Today, amidst the efforts of the government, I feel there is a need to expand the scope for Krishi Karman Award too. It is my request that keeping in mind the nutritional security of the country, a new category in the Krishi Karman Award should be created for nutritious grains - Nutri Cereals, Horticulture and Organic Agriculture. This will encourage the people and the states doing exceptional work in these areas.

Brothers and sisters, 

When our country celebrates 75 years of its independence in the year 2022, the accomplishment of our resolutions will be our tribute to our nation builders. Today we must leave this place with a new energy and a new commitment to double the income of farmers.

I am sure that each of our resolutions will definitely be fulfilled. Once again congratulations to every state, every farmer, and winners of the Krishi Karman Award! And my best wishes to all of you and to every farmer of the country for the New Year and Sankranti.

 

Thanks a lot!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi distributed Agriculture Minister’s Krishi Karman Awards for Progressive Farmers and Commendation Awards to the states at a public meeting in Tumkur, Karnataka today. He also released the 3rd installment of PM Kisan (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi) of Rs 2000 for the period December 2019 - March 2020. This will benefit approximately 6 crore beneficiaries and distributed Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) to select farmers of Karnataka.  Prime Minister handed over the Certificates to beneficiaries under PM Kisan from 8 States / UTs. Prime Minister also handed over the keys of Deep Sea fishing Vessels and Fishing Vessel Transponders to select farmers of Tamil Nadu.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that it is a great privilege for him to see Annadata - our peasant brothers and sisters, in the new year, the beginning of a new decade. On behalf of 130 crore countrymen, the Prime Minister thanked the country’s farmers for their toil.

The Prime Minister said that the land of Karnataka also witnessed a historic moment when money under the PMKISAN scheme has been distributed directly into the personal accounts of nearly 6 Crore Farmers in the country. Prime Minister said a total of Rs 12 Thousand Crores has been deposited under the 3rd tranche of the scheme.

He hoped that the States that haven't implemented the 'PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana', will do it and political parties will rise over politics to help the farmers in their States.

देश में एक वो दौर भी था जब देश में गरीब के लिए एक रुपए भेजा जाता था तो सिर्फ 15 पैसे पहुंचते थे।बाकी के 85 पैसे बिचौलिए मार जाते थे।आज जितने भेजे जा रहे हैं, उतने, पूरे के पूरे सीधे गरीब के खाते में पहुंच रहे हैं: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 2, 2020



PM recalled that there was also a period in the country, when one rupee was sent for the poor in the country and only 15 paise out of it reached the beneficiaries. And now he said that the money is reaching the poor directly without the intervention of the middlemen.

Prime Minister said that the irrigation projects that have been stalled for several decades are now being implemented. He also said that the centre has always given priority to the interests of our farmers with the schemes like crop insurance, soil health cards and 100% neem coated urea.

Prime Minister said that due to the efforts of the government, both the production and export of spices from India has increased considerably. “Spice production in India has increased by more than 2.5 million tons, so the export has also increased from about Rs 15 thousand crore to about Rs 19 thousand crore.”

Horticulture के अलावा दाल, तेल और मोटे अनाज के उत्पादन में भी दक्षिण भारत का हिस्सा अधिक है। भारत में दाल के उत्पादन को बढ़ावा देने के लिए बीज हब बनाए गए हैं, जिनमें से 30 से अधिक सेंटर कर्नाटका, आंध्रा, केरल, तमिलनाडु और तेलंगाना में ही हैं: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 2, 2020



He said that apart from horticulture, South India also has a large share in the production of pulses, oil and coarse grains.

Prime Minister said, “Seed hubs have been built to promote pulses production in India, of which more than 30 centers are located in Karnataka, Andhra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana itself.”

Referring to the Government’s efforts on Fisheries sector, Prime Minister said the government is working at three levels to strengthen the sector.

First - Encouraging fisheries in villages through financial assistance to fishermen.

Second- Modernizing the fishing boats under the Blue Revolution Scheme.

And third - Constructing modern infrastructure related to fish trade and business.

Prime Minister said, “fishermen have been linked to the Kisan Credit Card facility. New fishing harbors are being built in large rivers and in the sea for the convenience of fish farmers. A special fund of Rs 7.50 thousand crore has also been created for modern infrastructure. Fishermen's boats are being modernized for deep sea fishing and navigation devices are being installed in boats for the protection of fishermen with the help of ISRO.”

Keeping in view the nutritional security of the country, PM requested to create a new category in the Krishi Karman Award, for Nutri Cereals, Horticulture and Organic Agriculture. This will give impetus to people and states doing better work in these areas, he added.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi visited the Shri Siddhaganga Mutt in Tumkuru, Karnataka and laid the foundation stone for a memorial museum of Shri Shri Shivakumar Swamiji.

PM Modi while addressing at Shri Siddhaganga Mutt in Tumkuru, said he is fortunate that he is beginning the year 2020 from such pious land; He wished that the sacred energy of Sree Siddaganga Mutt enriches the lives of the people of our country.

He said, “We all feel the physical absence of Pujya Swami Shri Sri Shivkumar ji. I have personally experienced that his mere gaze was enriching and inspiring. With his inspiring personality this holy place has been giving direction to the society for decades”.

He said, “It is good fortune that I got an opportunity to lay the foundation stone of the museum to be built in the memory of Shri Shri Shivakumar Ji. This museum will not only inspire people, but will also serve to give direction to the society and country.”

Prime Minister said that India has entered the third decade of the 21st century with new energy and renewed vigor.

He asked the nation to remember how the last decade began. In contrast, he said, the third decade of the 21st Century has started on a strong footing of expectations, aspirations.

He said “The aspiration is for a new India. This aspiration is of young dreams. This is the aspiration of the sisters and daughters of the country. This aspiration is for the poor, downtrodden, deprived, afflicted, backward, tribals of the country”.

“This aspiration is to see India as a prosperous, capable and all-encompassing world power.It has now become the psyche of every Indian that the problems we have inherited have to be solved. This message emanating from the society also inspires, encourages our government.”

Prime Minister said that people fled from Pakistan to India, to save their lives, to save the lives of their daughters.

He further said that every countrymen has a question as to why people don’t speak against Pakistan and instead processions are being taken out against these people.

To those who are agitating against the Parliament of India, Prime Minister said, “If you have to agitate, raise your voice against the exploits of Pakistan in the last 70 years. Now the need is to expose this action of Pakistan at the international level. If you have to raise slogans, then raise slogans related to the way minorities are being tortured in Pakistan. If you have to take out a procession then take out a procession in support of Hindu-Dalit-victim-exploited from Pakistan”.

Prime Minister sought active support from Sant Samaj in 3 resolutions.

First, to reinforce India’s ancient culture of giving importance to every individual’s duties and obligations.

Second, to protect nature and the environment.

And third, to cooperate in public awareness for water conservation, water harvesting.

He said that India has always viewed saints, sages, gurus as a lighthouse for the right path.

                Honourable Shri Siddalingeshwara Swamy Ji, Chief Minister of Karnataka Shri BS Yediyurappa Ji, my cabinet colleagues Shri DV Sadanand Gowda ji, Shri Pralhad Joshi ji, Ministers of Karnataka Government, Respected Sant Samaj, devotees, ladies and gentlemen present here!  Greetings to everyone! I am very happy to be in Siddhaganga Mutt, the land of Dr. Shivkumar Swamiji in Tumkuru.  First of all, Happy New Year to all of you! 

Wish you all the best for the year 2020!

I am fortunate that I am starting the year 2020 with this holy land of Tumkuru in the presence of you all.  I wish that this sacred energy of the Siddhaganga Mutt makes all the citizens happy.

 

Friends, 

I am lucky to have come here today after so many years. But at the same time a sense of desolation is also gripping me.  We all feel the physical absence of Pujya Swami Sri Sri Shivakumar Ji.  As per my experience, one's life used to get filled with energy just by visiting him.  With his inspiring personality, this holy place has been giving direction to the society for decades.  Especially, the perpetual flow to build an educated and egalitarian society originates from here.  Swami ji has influenced huge number of people in his life which is quiet rare to see.

I am fortunate that I got the opportunity to lay the foundation stone of the museum to be built in the memory of Sri Sri Shivakumar Ji.  This museum will not only inspire people, but will also give us direction at the societal and national level.  I again pay my homage to Pujya Swamiji at his feet. 

Friends, I have come here at a time when another great saint has left the land of Karnataka.  The demise of Visvesh Tirtha Swami, the head of Pejavar Math is a loss to the Indian society.  The passing away of such pillars of our spiritual and social life leaves a big void.  We cannot stop this cycle, but we can definitely strengthen the path shown by these saints and dedicate ourselves to the service of humanity and the service of Mother India. 

Friends, this is also important because India has entered the third decade of 21st century with new energy and enthusiasm.  You might remember how the previous decade had started.  But this third decade of the 21st century has started with a strong foundation of expectations and aspirations. 

This aspiration is for the new India.  This aspiration is of young dreams.  This is the aspiration of the sisters and daughters of the country.  This aspiration is for the poor, downtrodden, deprived, afflicted, backward classes and tribals of the country.  What is this aspiration? This aspiration is about India being a prosperous, capable and benevolent world power.  This aspiration is about watching India establishing its natural place in the world map.

Friends, 

To fulfil this aspiration, the people of the country have given top priority to major changes as a nation.  Now it has become the psyche of every Indian that the problems we have inherited have to be solved.  The same message emanating from society also inspires and encourages our government.  This is the reason why the country has made unprecedented efforts to bring meaningful changes in the life of ordinary Indian since 2014. 

The past year has taken our efforts as a society, as a nation to greater heights.  Today, the resolution of the country to be free from open defecation is being accomplished.  The pledge of liberating the poor sisters of the country from smoke is being accomplished.  The resolve to connect every farmer family in the country with direct benefit transfer and connecting the farm workers, labourers, and small traders with social security and pension system is being fulfilled. 

The resolve to change the policy and practice of India against terrorism is also being fulfilled.  Abrogating Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir to end terror and remove uncertainty from people's lives is also proving to be the beginning of a new era of development led by the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The country has taken steps to restore the honour of the minorities who have been driven out from the neighbouring countries because of different religious faith.  And amidst all this, the path to a grand temple at the birthplace of Lord Rama has also been paved with complete peace and cooperation.Friends, 

A few weeks ago, our Parliament, the largest institution of our democracy, has also made a historic decision of formulating the Citizenship Amendment Act.  But the people of Congress, their allies and the ecosystem created by them have stood up against the Parliament of India.  Their hatred towards us is now being shown to the Parliament of the country.  These people have started a movement against the Parliament of India.  These people are agitating against the Dalits, oppressed and the exploited people driven out from Pakistan.

Friends, 

Pakistan was born on the basis of religion.  The country was divided on the basis of religion.  And at the time of partition, atrocities were committed against the people of other religions in Pakistan.  Over a period of time, persecution on the basis of religion, whether they were Hindus, Sikhs, Christians or Jains had increased in Pakistan.  Thousands of such people have had to leave their homes and come to India as refugees.

 

 

 Pakistan persecuted Hindus, oppressed Sikhs, Jains and Christians; but the Congress and its allies did not speak against Pakistan.  Today every countryman has a question that why are processions being taken out against those who have come here from Pakistan to save their lives and to save their daughters from the rapists, but are silent on the Pakistan which has committed such atrocities against them?

It is our duty to help the refugees from Pakistan and to stand with them.  It is our duty to not leave Hindus, Dalits and the oppressed from Pakistan to their fate and to help them.  It is our duty not to leave Sikhs from Pakistan to their fate and help them.  It is our duty not to leave the Jains and Christians from Pakistan to their fate and help them.

Friends, 

Today those who are agitating against the Parliament of India, I want to tell them that today there is a need to expose this act of Pakistan at international level.  If you have to agitate, then raise your voice against the atrocities committed by Pakistan over the last 70 years.

 

If you want to raise slogans, then raise slogans against the way minorities are being tortured in Pakistan.  If you want to take out a procession, then let it be in support of the Hindu, Dalit, oppressed and the exploited from Pakistan who have sought refuge here.  If you want to stage protests, then let it be against Pakistan. 

Friends, 

Our government is working day and night to solve the decades-old challenges facing the country.  It is our priority to make the lives of the people of the country easy. We are working on every such goal like - ensuring every poor in the country has a roof, every house has a gas connection, every house has piped water supply, every person has access to health facilities, every person has insurance cover, and every village is connected to broadband.

In 2014, when I had requested you to participate in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, you had extended your hands in support.  Due to the cooperation of crores of companions like you, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, India freed itself from open defecation.

 

Now that I have come to this sacred land today, I seek active support from Sant Samaj in 3 resolutions.  First, we have to reinforce our archaic culture of giving importance to our duties and obligations, constantly awakening people about it.  Second: protecting nature and the environment.  And third: cooperation in public awareness for water conservation and water harvesting.

Friends, 

India has always viewed saints, sages, gurus as a lighthouse for the right path.  In New India too, the role of every leadership of the country related to Siddhaganga Math, spirituality and faith is important.

May the blessings of all of you, the saints, be with us! May we fulfil our resolution with your blessings. With this wish I conclude my speech.

Many thanks to all of you!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

                In a boost to indigenous research capabilities in the defence sector, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will dedicate Five DRDO Young Scientists Laboratories to the nation on Thursday January 2, 2020.

The event shall be organised at the Aeronautical Development Establishment, DRDO at Bengaluru. Prime Minister shall unveil a plaque to mark the dedication, and address the Scientists.

DRDO will also showcase some of its innovative products to the Prime Minister at an Exhibition on the occasion.

Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa  and DRDO Chairman Dr. G Satheesh Reddy will be present on the occasion.

It may be recalled that in 2014, addressing a distinguished gathering of senior and eminent defence scientists, and senior officers of the armed forces, after giving away the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) awards, the Prime Minister had suggested that at least five DRDO labs should be identified exclusively for innovation from young scientists upto the age of 35 years.

On that occasion, the Prime Minister had also called for involving youth in defence research related activities in a big way, to ensure that India remained abreast of global technological advancements in the field.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has congratulated General Bipin Rawat on taking charge as India’s first Chief of Defence Staff. 

“I am delighted that as we begin the new year and new decade, India gets its first Chief of Defence Staff in General Bipin Rawat. I congratulate him and wish him the very best for this responsibility. He is an outstanding officer who has served India with great zeal.

As the first CDS takes charge, I pay homage to all those who have served and laid down their lives for our nation. I recall the valiant personnel who fought in Kargil, after which many discussions on reforming our military began, leading to today’s historic development.

On 15th August 2019, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I announced that India will have a Chief of Defence Staff. This institution carries tremendous responsibility of modernizing our military forces. It would also reflect the hopes and aspirations of 1.3 billion Indians.

Creation of the Department of Military Affairs with requisite military expertise and institutionalisation of the post of CDS is a momentous and comprehensive reform that will help our country face the ever-changing challenges of modern warfare”, the Prime Minister said.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval to the official amendments in the National Commission for Homoeopathy Bill, 2019 for amending the Homoeopathy Central Council (HCC) Act, 1973.  Presently, the Bill is pending in Rajya Sabha.

The amendments will: 


	ensure necessary regulatory reforms in the field of Homoeopathy education.
	enable transparency and accountability for protecting the interest of the general public.  The Commission will promote availability of affordable healthcare services in all parts of the country. 


Background:

          The Homoeopathy Central Council (HCC) Act, 1973 was enacted for constitution of a Central Council of Homoeopathy for regulation of education and practice of Homoeopathy, for maintenance of Central Register of Homoeopathy and for matters connected therewith.  This Act has been modelled on the pattern of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.  The broad functions, constitution, regulation making powers are identical to those of the Medical Council of India.  While the Act provides a solid foundation for the growth of medical education and practice in Homoeopathy, but various bottlenecks in the functioning of Council have been experienced, which has resulted in serious detrimental effects on medical education as well as delivery of quality Homoeopathy healthcare services.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the following: -


	Allocation of 30 percent of North Eastern Council’s (NEC’s) allocation for new projects under the existing “Schemes of North Eastern Council” for focussed development of deprived areas; deprived/neglected sections of society and emerging priority sectors in the North eastern States.  The balance allocation shall be bifurcated in the existing two components (State component-60% and Central component-40%) 



	Revision of the NEC guidelines for simplification of appraisal and approval mechanism 



	Allowing projects under State component, upto 25% of each State’s normative allocation, for sectors not covered in the mandate of NEC, but which are considered important as per local felt needs as per the recommendations of the State Governments. 


The projects under the existing “Schemes of NEC” will accrue socio-economic benefits to the marginalized and vulnerable groups of people in backward and neglected areas of the North Eastern States. It will lead to faster decision making and quick implementation of the projects.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 to amend the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. The Bill will be introduced in the ensuing session of theParliament.

Salient features of proposed amendments:


	Proposing requirement for opinion of one provider for termination of pregnancy, up to 20 weeks of gestation and introducing the requirement of opinion of two providers for termination of pregnancy of 20-24 weeks of gestation.
	Enhancing the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories of women which will be defined in the amendments to the MTP Rules and would include 'vulnerable women including survivors of rape, victims of incest and other vulnerable women (like differently-abled women, Minors) etc.
	Upper gestation limit not to apply in cases of substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by Medical Board. The composition, functions and other details of Medical Board to be prescribed subsequently in Rules under the Act.
	Name and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated shall not be revealed except to a person authorised in any law for the time being in force.


The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 is for expanding access of women to safe and legal abortion services on therapeutic, eugenic, humanitarianor social grounds. The proposed amendments includesubstitution of certainsub-sections, insertion of certain new clauses under some sections in the existing Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, with a view to increase upper gestation limit for termination of pregnancy under certain conditions and to strengthen access to comprehensiveabortioncare, under strict conditions, without compromisingservice andquality of safe abortion.

It is a step towards safety and well-being of the women and many women will be benefitted by this. Recently several petitions were received by the Courts seeking permission for aborting pregnancies at a gestational age beyond the present permissible limit on grounds of foetal abnormalities or pregnancies due to sexual violence faced by women. The proposed increase in gestational age will ensure dignity, autonomy, confidentiality and justice for women who need to terminate pregnancy.

In orderto increase access of women to safe abortion services and taking into account the advances in medical technology, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare proposed amendments after extensive consultation with various stake holders and several ministries.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for the proposal of the Legislative Department for allowing the Election Commission to enter into Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with the Independent High Authority for Elections of Tunisia (ISIE) and the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission(PNGEC) for elections for cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration. 

Impact:

The MOUs would promote bilateral cooperation, aimed at building technical assistance/ capacity support for the Independent High Authority for Elections of Tunisia (ISIE) and the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission(PNGEC) for elections for cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration, envisaging cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration and providing a leg-up to such bodies in conducting elections in their respective countries. This would also result in bolstering India's international relations.

Background

The Election Commission has been participating in promoting cooperation in the field of election matters and electoral processes across the world with certain foreign countries and agencies by adopting the mode of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the concerned parties. The Election Commission, a constitutional body, conducts the largest electoral exercise in the world. It is the responsibility of the Election Commission to organise free and fair elections in the country of about 85 crore voters with diverse socio-political and economic backgrounds. In recent years, the role being played by the Election Commission ensures greater participation of people in political affairs. India, today, is considered as the world's 'largest' democratic country. The success of democracy in India has attracted the attention of almost every political system around the world.

In its pursuit of excellence, the Election Commission has been receiving various proposals from foreign electoral bodies for developing bilateral relations in the field of election and matters connected therewith. The Election Commission forwarded a proposal to the Ministry of Law and Justice, Legislative Department relating to signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by it with the Election Commission of Maldives on cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration.

These MoUs contain standard articles/clauses which broadly express promotion of cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration including promotion of exchange of knowledge and experience in the field of organizational and technical development of electoral process; support in exchanging information, institutional strengthening and capacity building, training of personnel, holding regular consultations; etc.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for the Model Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for unilateral/bilateral recognition of Certificates, pursuant to Regulation  1/10 of International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) for Seafarers, 1978 as amended to be signed between the Directorate General of Shipping, Government of India and its counterparts in foreign countries, with the approval of Minister-in-charge of Shipping and the Minister of External Affairs.  

Benefits

The unilateral MoU would facilitate unilateral recognition by another country of the certificates issued by the Directorate General of Shipping to Indian seafarers, without seeking similar recognition by India of the certificates issued by that country. 

Indian Seafarers, therefore, will be eligible to be placed on ships under the flag of that country for employment, thus leading to increased employment opportunities. The proposed bilateral MoU will enable India and another country with which such an MoU may be entered, to mutually recognize maritime education and training, certificates of competency, endorsements, documentary evidence of training and medical fitness certificates, issued to the seafarers who are citizens of respective countries in accordance with the provisions of regulation 1/10 of the STCW Convention.  

The bilateral MoU would therefore, make the seafarers of both the countries to be eligible for employment on ships of either party based on the certificates so recognized.  India being a seafarer supplying nation with large pool of trained seafarers will stand to be benefitted.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the extension of the term of the Commission to examine the issue of Sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes, by six months that is up to 31.7.2020. 

The Cabinet has also approved addition of following Term of Reference to the existing Terms of Reference of the ""Commission"" -

“iv. to study the various Entries in the ""Central List of OBCs and recommend correction of any repetitions, ambiguities, inconsistencies and errors of spelling or transcription.""

 

Impact:

The Communities in the existing list of OBCs which have not been able to get any major benefit of the scheme of reservation for OBCs for appointment in Central Government posts & for admission in Central Government Educational Institutions are expected to be benefitted upon implementation of the recommendations of the Commission. The Commission is likely to make recommendations for benefit of such marginalized communities in the Central List of OBCs.

 

Financial Implications: 

The expenditure involved are related to the establishment and administration costs of the Commission, which would continue to be borne by the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment.

 

Benefits:

All persons belonging to the castes/communities which are included in the Central List of SEBCs but which have not been able to get any major benefit of the existing scheme of reservation for OBCs in Central Government posts & for admission in Central Government Educational Institutions would be benefitted. 

 

Implementation strategy and targets:

Orders for extension of the term of the Commission and addition in its Terms of Reference will be notified in the Gazette 'in the form of an Order made by the President, after receipt of the approval of the Hon'ble President to the same.

 

Background: 

The Commission was constituted under article 340 of the Constitution with the approval of President on 2nd  October, 2017. The Commission, headed by Justice (Retd.) Smt. G. Rohini commenced functioning on 11th October, 2017 and has since interacted with all the Stats/UTs which have subcategorized OBCs, and the State Backward Classes Commissions. The Commission has come to the view that it would require some more time to submit, its report since the repetitions, ambiguities, inconsistencies and errors of spelling or transcription etc appearing in the existing Central List of OBCs need to be cleared. Hence the Commission has sought extension of its term by six, that is upto 31st July 2020 and also addition in its existing Terms of Reference.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the Revised Cost Estimates (RCE) for establishment of permanent campuses of new National Institutes of Technology (NITs), at a total cost of Rs.4371.90 crore for the period till 2021 - 2022.

These NITs were established in the year 2009 and started functioning from academic year 2010-2011 in their respective temporary campus with very limited space and infrastructure. The projects at the permanent campus could not be completed in the manner envisaged due to late finalization of land required for construction and also the cost approved for construction works was far below the actual requirements.

With the approved Revised Cost Estimates, these NITs will be fully functional from their respective permanent campuses by 31st March, 2022. The overall student capacity in these campuses will be 6320.

NITs are Institutions of National Importance known to be among the best teaching Institutions in the field of engineering and technology and have made a remarkable presence with their high-quality technical education. These Institutes are capable of producing high quality technical manpower which will fuel entrepreneurship and generation of job opportunities throughout the country.

Background:

•    Department of Space (DOS) and the Mongolian Ministry of Infrastructure signed an 'Agreement for cooperation in space science, technology and applications' on January 15, 2004. Apart from training of Mongolian officials on space technology application, no major cooperative activities have been taken up. When our Embassy in Mongolia was contacted for reviving the cooperation, it is understood that Mongolian Ministry of Infrastructure is abolished and the space activities are presently handled by Communication and Information Technology Authority (CITA) of Mongolia.

 

•    Embassy has further mentioned that, b high level delegation from Mongolia is expected to visit India during September 2019 and space cooperation would be one of the agenda. Embassy requested ISRO to share a draft Agreement on space cooperation for further taking up with CITA. Accordingly, a draft Agreement for India-Mongolia Space cooperation was drafted and shared with

Embassy, with approval of Chairman, ISRO/ Secretary, DOS. Subsequently, Mongolian side has given its concurrence and both sides have arrived at workable version and proposed to sign the agreement during high level delegation visit from Mongolia.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approvalto confer the status of Institution of National Importance to the Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda Jamnagar by conglomerating the cluster of Ayurveda Institutes at Gujarat Ayurveda University campus, Jamnagar , namely, (a) Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (b) Shri Gulabkunwerba Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya and (c) Institute of Ayurveda Pharmaceutical Sciences including Pharmacy Unit and to subsume the Maharshi Patanjali Institute for Yoga & Naturopathy Education & Research into the Department of Swasthvritta of the Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda.

 

The Bill to that effect is to be introduced in the ensuing Session of Parliament to declare Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Jamnagar as Institution of National Importance.

 

Considering the rapidly growing role of AYUSH Systems in addressing the Public Health challenges of India, conferring the status of National Importance will boost the role and importance of Ayurveda in Public Health. The strengthening of Ayurveda will reduce government expenditure on health as Ayurveda is cost-effective because of its preventive and curative approaches.

 

 There is rising interest and demand for knowledge and services of Ayurveda all over the world. India is the country of origin of Ayurveda and the world is looking up to India to showcase state of art institutions providing international level education and training in Ayurveda. Elevation of the proposed Institute to the status of Institution of National Importance will provide it the autonomy to upgrade standard of Ayurveda education, frame various courses in Ayurveda as per national and international demand, adopt advanced evaluation methodology, etc. It will have the mandate to frame its own certification courses for deeper penetration of AYUSH across masses and will give the capacity to bring out the unrealized potential of Ayurveda for addressing the major public health challenges faced by the country. It will help the institute to develop tertiary care in Ayurveda and to secure inter-disciplinary collaborations to give a contemporary thrust to Ayurveda.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval as under: 

 

(i)     Shutting down the operations of the plant/unit of Hindustan Fluorocarbons Limited (HFL) and closure of the company.

 

(ii)   Separating the employees rendered surplus through VRS/VSS, after payment of all their outstanding salary/wages and statutory dues, except for the skeletal staff required to implement the closure of the company. Employees not opting for VRS will be retrenched as per Industrial Disputes Act.

 

(iii)   Grant of interest free loan of Rs.77.20 crore by the Govt. to HFL for expenditure exclusively on closure of HFL viz. implementation of VRS/VSS, payment of outstanding salary & statutory dues, etc. and salary/wages and administrative expenses of HFL's skeletal staff to be retained for implementing the closure of HFL.

 

(iv)   Above interest free loan of Rs.77.20 crore is to be repaid to Gol from the disposal of land and other assets of HFL after settling all closure related liabilities. If the land/ assets sale proceeds are not sufficient to repay the loan amount, then the balance loan amount is to be written off.

 

(v)     After repayment of the loan of Rs.77.20 crore and settlement of all other closure related liabilities of HFL, surplus proceeds from disposal of land and assets will be used for repayment of HFL's outstanding Gol loans (Rs.15.80 crore) and interest, with freezing of interest up to 31.03.2019. Full or part of the principal loan amount and interest thereon remaining unpaid due to insufficient sale proceeds is to be written off/waived.

 

(vi)   Appointment of NBCC (India) Ltd. as Land Management Agencies (LMA) for facilitating disposal of HFL's land assets subject to outcome of the decision of Telangana Govt./TSIIC on purchasing land of HFL.

 

(vii)    Disposal of plant/machinery and movable assets will be done by HFL through e-auction by MSTC Ltd.

 

HFL has only one plant/unit located at Rudraram, District Sangareddy in Telangana.

 

Financial Implications: 

Financial implications of the proposal for closure of HFL involves providing financial support of Rs.77.20 crore (cash) to HFL in the form of interest free loan for settling closure related liabilities of HFL viz. (a) implementation of VRS/VSS, payment of outstanding salary & statutory dues, payment of suppliers/contractors/utilities dues and repayment of SBI working capital credit and (b) salary/wages and administrative expenses of HFL skeletal staff to be retained for implementing the closure plan for two years. Above interest free loan is proposed to be repaid from the proceeds of the disposal of land and other assets of HFL after settling all the liabilities relating to closure of the company. If the land / assets sale proceeds are not sufficient to fully repay the loan amount, then the balance loan amount is to be written off.

 

Implementation schedule: 

Taking date of receipt of CCEA approval as ‘T’-

 


	Notice to Employees for VRS/VSS: T+10 days.
	Request for budgetary support / bridge loan from D/o Expenditure: T+15 days.
	Approval by HFL and HOCL Board and shareholders and information of the decision to BSE: T+80 days. 
	Settlement of salaries/ wages and statutory dues of employees and separation of employees  through  VRS/VSS   (except skeletal  staff and  those  not  opting  for VRS/VSS): T+120 days.
	Retrenchment of employees not opting for VRS/VSS: T + 180 days. 
	Disposal of movable assets/ plant & machinery through e-auction by MSTC: T+ 180 days. 



	vii. Disposal of land assets through NBCC (LMA) subject to decision of Telangana Govt. on purchasing the land: T+ 240 days. 



	Application to SEBI/BSE for exit option to shareholders and Voluntary winding up and Delisting under provisions of Companies Act, Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code and SEBI regulations: T + 400 days.


 

Impact: 

With unviable scale of operations, very old plants & technology and only one revenue earning product (HCFC-22) but of no strategic significance, sustainable revival of HFL is not economically viable. Moreover, the inevitable reduction in HCFC-22 quota of HFL in 2020 will make the company's operations completely non-viable from March, 2020 onwards. Closure of the company's operations will not only avoid any future risks / liabilities but also protect the interest and welfare of HFL employees by separating them through VRS/VSS. Thereafter, disposal of the company's land assets will enable their redeployment for more productive use which can attract both domestic and foreign investments.  However, interest and welfare of employees rendered surplus will be protected by payment of all their outstanding salary & statutory dues and giving VRS / VSS compensation to them as per DPE guidelines.

 

Background: 

Hindustan Fluorocarbons Limited (HFL) is a subsidiary company of Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd. (HOCL), a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the administrative control of the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals. HFL is engaged in the manufacture of Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (PTFF) and Chloro Di Fluoro Methane (HCFC-22 or CFM-22). The company has been making losses since 2013-14 and has negative net worth. As on 31.3.2019, it had accumulated losses of Rs.62.81 crore and negative net worth of (-)Rs.43.20 crore. It was also registered with the erstwhile Board for Industrial and Financial Construction (BIFR) as a sick company.

 

HFL manufactures HCFC-22 and also uses the same for conversion to PTFE. Due to uneconomic plant capacity and old technology, conversion of HCFC-22 to PTFE is not financially viable and the company is constrained to sell higher quantity of HCFC- 22 directly as refrigerant gas. Under the provisions of Montreal Protocol on phasing out of ozone depleting substances, HFL's HCFC-22 non-feedstock production quota is only about 392 MT per calendar year which was enhanced to 1100 MT during the last 3 years by the Ministry of Environment Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC) based on the exemption request of this Department. The HCFC-22 quota is to be reduced further by 25% from calendar year 2020 and the MoEFCC is not likely to agree to any further exemptions for HFL. The reduced HCFC-22 quota of about 282 MT would be sufficient for plant operations only up to March / April, 2020, and, thereafter, HFL would be forced to shutdown its plant for the remaining months of the year. Since HFL's operations are not likely to be sustainable after March, 2020 onwards, it is necessary to expeditiously close down the operations of the company and separate its employees through VRS/VSS.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has given 'in principle' approval for strategic disinvestment of equity shareholding of Minerals & Metals Trading Corporation Limited (MMTC) (49.78%), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) (10.10%), MECON (0.68%) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) (0.68%) and two Odisha State Government PSUs namely; Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Odisha Ltd.(IPICOL) (12.00%) and Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) (20.47%) in Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL) to a strategic buyer, identified through a two-stage auction procedure. NINL is a Joint Venture company, in which four CPSEs namely MMTC, NMDC, BHEL and MECON and 2 State PSUs of Odisha Government, namely IPICOL and OMC are shareholders.

The proposed strategic disinvestment of NINL would unlock resources to be used to finance the social sector/developmental programmes of the Government benefiting the public. It is also expected that the successful strategic buyer may bring in new management/technology/investment for the growth of the company and may use innovative methods for the development of the business operations of the company, which may generate more employment opportunities.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval as under:


	The North East Gas Grid project of Indradhanush Gas Grid Limited with viability Gap Funding/ Capital Grant at 60% of the estimated cost of Rs 9265 crore (Including interest during construction). Quantum of VGF would be capped at 60% of estimated project cost and would not be linked with upward capital cost variation. 


· MoPNG shall identify milestones for major activities for this project and link the same for releases of capital grant of the project.


	For effective monitoring of the project implementation, a Committee comprising of officials from Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Development of North East Region, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, and Department of Fertilizers, may be formed, which would periodically review the progress in implementation of the project and take steps to smoothen out any issues in execution.


Total length of pipeline is 1656 KM and tentative project cost is Rs 9265 crore.As per the plan, Gas Pipeline Grid would be developed in the eight states of the North-Eastern region i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura.

The Capital Grant will provide natural gas supplies to various types of consumers viz. Industrial, PNG(Domestic),  CNG  (Transport)   etc.   and   would   immensely help   in substituting the liquid fuels. The pipeline grid would ensure reliability and uninterrupted natural gas supplies to the consumers which otherwise gets severely affected due to various reasons in this part of the country.

Availability of Natural gas across the region is expected to boost industrial growth without impacting the environment and would offer better quality of life to the people in general due to use of cleaner and green fuel. 

Socio-Economic and Environmental Benefits


	Development of industrial climate in eight states of the north-eastern region i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura.


· Reduction in the usage of kerosene, wood etc. due to increased usage of environment friendly fuel natural gas thereby improving the environment in the region.

· Improvement in the standard of living of peoples living in the region.

· It will boost Exploration & Production activities and connect regional gas sources with pipeline network for early monetisation of natural resources in the region.


	Possibility of installing bottling plants for LPG can be explored for reducing transportation cost. Uninterrupted supply of LPG and other valueadded products can be ensured in the region which will bring energy security to the people in the area.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval to the official amendments in the National Commission for Homoeopathy Bill, 2019 for amending the Homoeopathy Central Council (HCC) Act, 1973.  Presently, the Bill is pending in Rajya Sabha.

The amendments will: 


	ensure necessary regulatory reforms in the field of Homoeopathy education.
	enable transparency and accountability for protecting the interest of the general public.  The Commission will promote availability of affordable healthcare services in all parts of the country. 


Background:

          The Homoeopathy Central Council (HCC) Act, 1973 was enacted for constitution of a Central Council of Homoeopathy for regulation of education and practice of Homoeopathy, for maintenance of Central Register of Homoeopathy and for matters connected therewith.  This Act has been modelled on the pattern of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.  The broad functions, constitution, regulation making powers are identical to those of the Medical Council of India.  While the Act provides a solid foundation for the growth of medical education and practice in Homoeopathy, but various bottlenecks in the functioning of Council have been experienced, which has resulted in serious detrimental effects on medical education as well as delivery of quality Homoeopathy healthcare services.

                The public in general and AYUSH professionals in particular are hereby cautioned that in recent past, some fraudulent/ suspicious advertisements for recruitment of AYUSH professionals have come up in the electronic media which seek to draw out payment in the form of “Registration Fees” etc. from gullible individuals. Such fraudulent/ suspicious notices are issued typically by agencies with misleading names that sound like government bodies, and seek to elicit payments (described as “fees” of various types) through online payment methods.

One such fraudulent/ suspicious advertisement that has come to the notice of the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India appeared on the blog-publishing platform “Blogspot” in the name of AYUSHGRAM BHARAT, which claims to be the NRHM WELLNESS CENTER INDIA. The link to the advertisement is https://ayushgrambharat.blogspot.com/2020/01/welcome-to-ayushgram-bharat-nrhm.html

While the Ministry of AYUSH will seek appropriate administrative and legal action in the matter, the public in general and AYUSH professionals in particular are hereby requested to note that the recruitment process followed by the Ministry of AYUSH and its subordinate organisations always follow the formal procedures prescribed by the Government of India, and are accompanied by formal announcements in the official websites (which are hosted on the NIC/ gov.in platform) of the respective organisations.

The Ministry hereby cautions all concerned that the Ministry of AYUSH has no connection whatsoever to the aforesaid recruitment announcement by individuals / recruitment agencies who are misguiding job-seekers by promising them government positions. Further, they are also seen to be un-authorisedly using logo/ images belonging to the Government of India as well as fake address similar to that of the Ministry to mislead the people. 

The public in general and AYUSH professionals in particular are hereby advised to kindly cross-check the facts stated in such advertisements and verify the identity/ authenticity of individuals / recruitment agencies who issue such advertisements, before responding to them.

The Bill to that effect is to be introduced in the ensuing Session of Parliament to declare Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Jamnagar as Institution of National Importance.

 

Considering the rapidly growing role of AYUSH Systems in addressing the Public Health challenges of India, conferring the status of National Importance will boost the role and importance of Ayurveda in Public Health. The strengthening of Ayurveda will reduce government expenditure on health as Ayurveda is cost-effective because of its preventive and curative approaches.

 

 There is rising interest and demand for knowledge and services of Ayurveda all over the world. India is the country of origin of Ayurveda and the world is looking up to India to showcase state of art institutions providing international level education and training in Ayurveda. Elevation of the proposed Institute to the status of Institution of National Importance will provide it the autonomy to upgrade standard of Ayurveda education, frame various courses in Ayurveda as per national and international demand, adopt advanced evaluation methodology, etc. It will have the mandate to frame its own certification courses for deeper penetration of AYUSH across masses and will give the capacity to bring out the unrealized potential of Ayurveda for addressing the major public health challenges faced by the country. It will help the institute to develop tertiary care in Ayurveda and to secure inter-disciplinary collaborations to give a contemporary thrust to Ayurveda.

                India’s  latest  communication  satellite  GSAT-30  was  successfully  launched  from the  Spaceport  in  French  Guiana  during  the  early  hours  today. The  launch  vehicle  Ariane  5  VA-251  lifted  off  from  Kourou  Launch  Base,  French Guiana  at  2:35  am  IST  carrying  India’s  GSAT-30  and  EUTELSAT  KONNECT  for Eutelsat,  as  scheduled. 

After  a  flight  lasting  38  minutes  25  seconds,  GSAT-30  separated  from  the Ariane  5  upper  stage  in  an  elliptical  Geosynchronous  Transfer  Orbit.

With  a  lift-off  mass  of  3357  kg,  GSAT-30  will  provide  continuity  to  operational services  on  some  of  the  in-orbit  satellites.  GSAT-30  derives  its  heritage  from ISRO’s  earlier INSAT/GSAT  satellite  series  and  will  replace  INSAT-4A  in  orbit.

“GSAT-30  has  a  unique  configuration  of  providing  flexible  frequency  segments and  flexible  coverage.    The  satellite  will  provide  communication  services  to Indian  mainland  and  islands  through  Ku-band  and  wide  coverage  covering  Gulf countries,  a  large  number  of  Asian  countries  and  Australia  through  C-band” ISRO Chairman  Dr K Sivan  said. Dr.  Sivan  also  said  that  “GSAT-30  will  provide  DTH  Television  Services, connectivity  to  VSATs  for  ATM,  Stock-exchange,  Television  uplinking  and Teleport  Services,  Digital  Satellite  News  Gathering  (DSNG)  and  e-governance applications.  The  satellite  will  also  be  used  for  bulk  data  transfer  for  a  host  of emerging  telecommunication  applications.”   

ISRO’s  Master  Control  Facility  (MCF)  at  Hassan  in  Karnataka  took  over  the command  and  control  of  GSAT-30  immediately  after  its  separation  from  the launch  vehicle.  Preliminary  health  checks  of  the  satellite  revealed  its  normal health.

In  the  days  ahead,  orbit-raising  manoeuvres  will  be  performed  to  place  the satellite  in  Geostationary  Orbit  (36,000  km  above  the  equator)  by  using  its  onboard  propulsion  system.   During  the  final  stages  of  its  orbit  raising  operations,  the  two  solar  arrays  and  the antenna  reflectors  of  GSAT-30  will  be  deployed.    Following  this,  the  satellite  will be  put  in  its  final  orbital  configuration.    The  satellite  will  be  operational  after  the successful  completion  of  all  in-orbit  tests.

                “Gaganyaan” space astronauts will start their training this month, most likely in the third week of January.

This was disclosed here today by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh who also said that the training of the astronauts for India's first human space mission will take place in Russia.  Four astronauts have been identified for the mission, he added. 

It was further disclosed by the Minister that four astronauts, shortlisted for the mission, will receive training for 11 months.  All the four astronauts selected for the mission are men but their identity cannot be revealed. 

After 11 months of training in Russia, the astronauts will receive module specific training in India. In that, they will be trained in crew and service module designed by ISRO, learn to operate it, work around it and do simulations.  As per the ISRO sources, India's heaviest launch vehicle “Bahubali” GSLV Mark-III will the carry astronauts to space. 

Rs.10,000 crores has already been sanctioned by the Union Cabinet  for  the Gaganyaan project. This followed the announcement made by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on the Independence Day last year, stating that the Gaganyaan launch will coincide with the 75th year of India’s Independence. 

Though the first Indian to go into space was Rakesh Sharma in 1984 but the spacecraft in which he went was not Indian.  Therefore, Gaganyaan will be the first - ever human space mission conceived and developed in India, as a distinct illustration of the Prime Minister’s ""Make in India"" vision.

Background:

•    Department of Space (DOS) and the Mongolian Ministry of Infrastructure signed an 'Agreement for cooperation in space science, technology and applications' on January 15, 2004. Apart from training of Mongolian officials on space technology application, no major cooperative activities have been taken up. When our Embassy in Mongolia was contacted for reviving the cooperation, it is understood that Mongolian Ministry of Infrastructure is abolished and the space activities are presently handled by Communication and Information Technology Authority (CITA) of Mongolia.

 

•    Embassy has further mentioned that, b high level delegation from Mongolia is expected to visit India during September 2019 and space cooperation would be one of the agenda. Embassy requested ISRO to share a draft Agreement on space cooperation for further taking up with CITA. Accordingly, a draft Agreement for India-Mongolia Space cooperation was drafted and shared with

Embassy, with approval of Chairman, ISRO/ Secretary, DOS. Subsequently, Mongolian side has given its concurrence and both sides have arrived at workable version and proposed to sign the agreement during high level delegation visit from Mongolia.

                The Chairman Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Dr K Sivan briefed media at a Press Meet organised at ISRO Headquarters, Bengaluru today. During the Press Meet, Dr Sivan outlined ISRO’s achievements during the last one year and also the plans to be accomplished during the current year.



During 2019, six launch vehicle and seven satellite missions were realised by ISRO. The year also marked the 50th launch of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Dr Sivan said that two new variants of the PSLV were introduced. For the first time, the spent fourth stage of the PSLV was successfully demonstrated as an experimental orbital platform. Indigenously developed Vikram processor by Semi-Conductor Laboratory was flight tested during the year. International mobile standards body 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) approved India’s regional navigation satellite system NavIC which would facilitate NavIC’s use in mobile phones.



On the capacity building front, a second launch port, exclusively for the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), is planned to be established in Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu. “Land acquisition activities are presently in progress”, said Dr. Sivan. A second Vehicle Assembly Building in SDSC SHAR Sriharikota was dedicated to the nation during the year for increasing the launch frequency. As part of the enhanced outreach activity, a launch viewing gallery was operationalised in Sriharikota to facilitate viewing of launches live by the public.

In an effort towards horizontal expansion of ISRO, Space Technology Cells, Space Technology Incubation Centres andRegional Academic Centres for Space were established during the year and many more such centres are planned in the future. A special programme for school children called “YuvaVIgyaniKAryakram (YUVIKA)""aimed at imparting basic knowledge on Space Technology, Space Science and Space Applications was also introduced during the last year.

To carry forward the industry production of space systems, ISRO incorporated New Space India Limited (NSIL), under the Department of Space and efforts in realising PSLVs from industry initiated.

Pertaining to future programmes, Dr Sivan said Chandrayaan-3 mission to the moon, comprising a lander and a rover is approved by the Government and activities for its realisation are in progress.

Talking about India’s first human space flight mission Gaganyaan, Dr. Sivan said “We’ve made good progress in the mission. The process of Astronaut selection for the mission is completed”. He further added that four astronauts have been selected, who will undergo extensive training.

Other projects during the year include SSLV, GSLV with 4m ogive payload fairing, GSAT-20 satellite, NavIC with indigenous atomic clocks, Indian Data Relay Satellite System, Aditya-L1 and XPOSAT.

                Election Commission of India has considered the response received from the two Bhartiya Janata Party leaders, namely Sh. Anurag Thakur and Sh. Parvesh Sahib Singh in context of the Show Cause Notices issued to both these leaders on 28th January 2020 and 29th January 2020 respectively. The Commission is of the considered view that Sh. Anurag Thakur and Sh. Parvesh Sahib Singh have made undesirable and objectionable statements and thus violated the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and Representation of the People Act 1951.

            The Commission under Article 324 of the Constitution of India and all other powers enabling it in this behalf, bars Sh.Anurag Thakur and Sh.Parvesh Sahib Singh from holding any public meetings, public processions, public rallies, road shows and interviews, public utterances in media (electronic, print, social media) etc in connection with ongoing General Elections to the Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi, 2020 for a period of 72 hours (for Sh. Anurag Thakur) and 96 hours (for Sh.Parvesh Sahib Singh) from 5 PM on 30th January, 2020 (Thursday).

            Election Commission of India's orders already passed on 29th January 2020 to remove Sh.Anurag Thakur and Sh.Parvesh Sahib Singh from the list of ‘Star Campaigners’ for the current General Election to the Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi shall continue to be in force.

            ECI’s orders issued in this regard are attached herewith.

                Chief Election Commissioner of India, Shri Sunil Arora today assumed Chairmanship of The Forum of the Election Management Bodies (EMBs) of South Asia (FEMBoSA) for the year 2020. The Outgoing Chair of FEMBoSA, Mr. K.M.Nurul Huda,  CEC of Bangladesh handed over the Logo of FEMBoSA to the Incoming Chair, Mr. Sunil Arora at the 10th Annual Meeting of  FEMBoSA  held in New Delhi today.

In his address, Mr. Nurul Huda stated that in keeping with the objectives of the Forum, members have been sharing experiences and skills and taking steps to enhance cooperation with other EMBs.   EMB Bangladesh presented the Stewardship Report on the activities of FEMBoSA members during the last year.

Accepting the responsibility as Chairperson of the Forum, Sh Arora thanked the delegates for the trust and confidence reposed in the Election Commission of India. Sh. Arora said “The democratic scaffold and superstructure can be enacted and strengthened on the principle that the political power is validated by the will of the people. In democracy, power is won and legitimized only by regular elections, based on the universal, equal, direct and freely expressed suffrage”. Strong participatory and inclusive democracies are better able to ensure good governance and empowerment of all the citizens, he said. Sh. Arora added that for Capacity Building, Election Commission of India has established the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM) in June 2011.

FEMBoSA was established at the 3rd Conference of Heads of Election Management Bodies (EMBs) of SAARC Countries held at New Delhi in May, 2012. With its eight members, FEMBoSA represents a very large part of the democratic world and is an active regional association of EMBs.  Annual FEMBoSA meeting is held by rotation among the members.  The last (9th) annual meeting of FEMBoSA was held in Dhaka in September 2018.

A New Delhi Resolution was unanimously adopted at the 10th FEMBoSA Annual Meeting today by the seven FEMBoSA members present at the meeting. The Members resolved to : Implement the Work Plan for 2020 as approved by the member EMBs in the 10th Meeting of FEMBoSA; Cooperate in capacity building of the member countries; Host election visitor programmes in the respective countries as feasible; Provide technical assistance to the members as requested and as feasible; Actively share best practices and knowledge in ICT tools and modules being used by the member EMBs and to develop standards for sustainable use of ICT in elections; Take steps to curb use of money power and muscle power; Enhance and ease participation of Persons with Disabilities and Senior Citizens in the election process; Maintain the permanent content management based web portal of FEMBoSA to share information among the EMBs through the www.fembosa.org web portal; Design and implement regional research projects.

The Work Plan for 2020 on ‘Use of Technology in Elections’ calls for Members to undertake projects and initiatives on various aspects of use of technology in elections and present a report on their experiences and challenges faced in this regard at the next FEMBoSA Meeting.

On the sidelines of the Conference, ECI renewed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for cooperation in the field of election management with the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan. The MOU was signed by H.E. Mrs. Hawa Alam Nooristani, Chairwoman, IEC Afghanistan and by Shri Sunil Arora, CEC on behalf of ECI. An MoU for cooperation in the field of election management was also signed with the Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE) of Tunisia.  The MOU was signed by H.E. Mr. Nabil Baffoun, President, ISIE of Tunisia and by Shri Arora.

An International Conference was also organised today on the theme “Strengthening Institutional Capacity”, where nearly 30 delegates gathered to attend the International Conference. The day long International Conference included delegates from participating FEMBoSA members as also participants from EMBs of Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgystan, Mauritius, Tunisia and three International Organisations viz. the A-WEB, International Foundation of Electoral Systems and International IDEA. Presentations were made by delegates from ECs of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Kyrgyz Republic, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, IFES and Intl. IDEA. The representatives shared their experiences, best practices and initiatives. Experts also analysed barriers, policy interventions, strategies, programmes, good practices and technological innovation for strengthening Institutional capacity of EMBs.

On this occasion, CEC Sh Sunil Arora along with the two Election Commissioners of India Sh. Ashok Lavasa and Sh. Sushil Chandra and Secretary General, ECI Sh Umesh Sinha also launched the 10th issue of ECI’s magazine – ‘VOICE International’ which carries articles on the theme of “Innovative Methods of Voter Registration”. The 4th Issue of magazine “My Vote Matters” was also released on the occasion. A webportal on Association of World Election Bodies (A-WEB) was also unveiled. IIIDEM will host A-WEB Centre for documentation, research and training for sharing the best practices and capacity building of officials of A-WEB members. The Commission also released “ICT 2020; a compendium of 20 Apps for Election”.

Election Commission of India has endeavoured to play a pioneering role in organizing free, fair and credible elections in a participative manner in the largest democracy in the world.  It enjoys impeccable reputation in imparting knowledge and sharing skills and best practices with other EMBs through its robust international cooperation programme.  In September 2019, ECI took over as Chair of the 115 member Association of World Election Bodies for 2019-21 term.  Earlier today, ECI assumed Chairmanship of FEMBoSA for 2020.  ECI remains committed to the ideals and objectives of these Associations and looks forward to further strengthen its cooperation and interaction with fellow EMBs to spread the march of democracy globally.

                Election Commission of India today organised the 1st Sukumar Sen Memorial Lecture instituted as a tribute to the first Chief Election Commissioner of India. Sh Sen had served as the first Chief Election Commissioner of India from 21st March 1950 till 19th December, 1958. 

Former President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee delivered the inaugural lecture on electoral processes of India and challenges of our electoral systems. Sh Mukherjee's lecture highlighted the importance of institutions in our National evolution. 

Speaking on the occasion, Sh Mukherjee described Sh Sukumar Sen as ""chosen to play obstetrician and to deliver Indian democracy’s first crop of nearly three thousand elected representative. Realising with surprising un-I.C.S. humility that democracy likes its mechanics to be as self-effacing as possible, the Chief Election Commissioner became an unseen, undogmatic influence patiently judicial in his attitude to parties but insistent in regard to the machine he wielded"".   Sh Mukherjee noted ""Free, fair, popular and credible elections are a cornerstone, indeed the life blood of Democracy. Sen, by seamlessly conducting the first two general elections, aided India’s transition from a Crown colony to a sovereign Democratic Republic in practical terms.""

Sh Mukherjee recalled that ""The Constituent Assembly of India, which prepared the Constitution, had intensely debated the issue of universal adult franchise. It had unhesitatingly adopted the principle of adult suffrage with the full knowledge of the difficulties involved."" The Former president said ""The foremost achievement of the First General Election lies in the fact that it cemented and painstakingly brought about unification of India"". Indian democracy and its inherent power of assimilation has successfully thwarted insurgency and separate movements and elections have successfully co-opted varied groups into the electoral mainstream, he stated. ""Indian Democracy has been tested time and again. Consensus is the lifeblood of Democracy. Democracy thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent. Enthusiastic participation of people in the electoral process is the key to healthy democracy"", he underlined.

Speaking about the role of Election Commission, Sh Pranab Mukhejee said, ""In my opinion, the Election Commission of India, respected and revered by the people and feared by the participants of elections, has mostly stood the test of time. The role of the Election Commission in the practical play of democracy in India has been simply outstanding. The challenges it has had to face have been daunting. The management of an electorate of over 900 million in 2019 that is nearly the combined population of third, fourth and fifth largest nations in the world, and ensuring fair polling is not an easy job. I compliment the Election Commission for this laudable achievement.""

Taking note of some of  the challenges that our electoral system  faces, Sh Mukherjee spoke of embargo on the sanctioning and implementation of developmental projects; Disproportionately large size of the electorate vis-à-vis the number of public representatives as also adequate representation of women in Parliament and the Assemblies that has emerged as a major area of concern. Highlighting the importance of institutions, Sh Mukherjee complemented ""If democracy has succeeded, its largely due to the perfect conduct of elections by all Election Commissioners starting from Sukumar Sen to the present Election Commissioners"". There can be no room for speculation that challenges the very basis of our democracy. People's mandate is sacrosanct and has to be above any iota of reasonable doubt, he emphasized.

Earlier, in his opening remarks, Chief Election Commissioner Sh Sunil Arora said ""Election Commission of India is indebted to Shri Pranab Mukherjee for kindly agreeing to deliver the First Sukumar Sen Memorial Lecture. There could not be a harmonious combination of theme and the speaker for this evening - a savant and a rajrishi"". Shri Mukherjee, is considered a living encyclopedia of political, constitutional and historical matters. He was honoured with Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award, in 2019 for his distinguished contribution to public affairs. ""Shri Mukherjee, as President of the republic, had addressed ECI's National Voters Day event twice in 2016 and 2017. We are delighted to have him back to deliver the inaugural Sukumar Sen Memorial Lecture"", Sh Arora added. He also elaborated that the objective of this lecture is to make a positive intervention in the democratic and electoral discourse, within the ambit of the Constitutional mandate of the Election Commission of India. ECI wishes to involve a wide cross-section of people including political parties, leading constitutionalists, legal luminaries, academicians, civil society activists in it. He also remembered Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose on his 123rd birth anniversary today. 

Shri Ashok Lavasa, Election Commissioner welcomed the gathering and Shri Sushil Chandra, Election Commissioner thanked the audience on this momentous occasion.

 It may be recalled that Sh Sukumar Sen commendably conducted the first two Lok Sabha elections of India held in 1952 and 1957 simultaneously with the Legislative Assembly Elections based on universal adult franchise under challenging circumstances and little precedence to guide him. On this occasion a reprint of the Report on India's First Election was released by Shri Pranab Mukherjee as also a postal stamp in memory of Shri Sukumar Sen was unveiled.  It is proposed that every year a leading figure, whether from India or abroad, who had made a recognizable contribution in furthering democracy, would be invited to deliver the lecture. 

Today's lecture was attended by Mr. Sen’s family members, grandchildren Dr Asis Mukerjee, Mrs Shyamali Mukerjee, Sanjiv Sen, Sonali Sen, Debdatta Sen, Sujaya Sen and great grandchildren Aditya Vikram Sen, Arjun Veer Sen as also a wide cross section of invitees from National Political Parties, Members of the Academia, Civil Society Organisations, senior civil servants, media persons as also the international delegates who have gathered in New Delhi to attend the 10th Annual Meeting of The Forum of the Election Management Bodies of South  Asia (FEMBoSA) & an International Conference on ‘Strengthening Institutional Capacity’ being hosted by ECI on 24th of January 2020.

                The Election Commission of India is going to host the 10th annual meeting of the  Forum of the Election Management Bodies of South Asia (FEMBoSA) at New Delhi on 24 January 2020 and take over as Chair of FEMBoSA for 2020.  On this occasion, an International Conference on the theme ‘Strengthening Institutional Capacity’ is also being organised the same day. 

 FEMBoSA was established at the 3rd Conference of Heads of Election Management Bodies (EMBs) of SAARC Countries held at New Delhi from April 30 to May 2, 2012 through a unanimously adopted resolution on 1st May, 2012 to establish the Forum.  The Conference also unanimously adopted the Charter of the Forum.  The annual FEMBoSA meeting is held by rotation among the members.  The last (9th) annual meeting of FEMBoSA was held in Dhaka in September 2018. Besides ECI, the other 7 members are EMBs from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The FEMBoSA  represents a very large part of the democratic world and is an active regional association of the election management bodies of South Asia. The objectives of the Forum are to promote contact among the EMBs of the SAARC countries; share experiences with a view to learning from each other and cooperate with one  another in enhancing the capabilities of the EMBs  towards conducting free and fair elections.

At the forthcoming FEMBoSA meeting, the delegates would, inter alia, take stock of the activities undertaken by the members during the last year 2019 and discuss/finalise a Work Plan for its members for the year 2020.

 An International Conference on ‘Strengthening Institutional Capacity’ would also be organised on 24th Jan 2020. The conference would include, besides delegates from participating FEMBoSA members, participants  from Election Managements Bodies (EMBs) of Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgystan Mauritius, Tunisia, and three International Organisations viz. the Association of World Election Bodies (A-WEB) based in Seoul, Republic of Korea; the US based International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) and International IDEA.

There will be three sessions during the Conference where representatives from the EMBs and International Organisations will participate and share their experiences, best practices and initiatives taken towards ‘Strengthening Institutional Capacity’ of EMBs  in various countries. On this occasion, the January 2020 issue of ECI’s quarterly magazine “Voice International” will be released, which will carry articles on the theme of “Innovative Methods of Voter Registration”.  

On the sidelines of the Conference, ECI will also renew Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for cooperation in the field of election management with the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan.  The previous MoU was signed in April 2008 and expired in April 2013.   Besides that, an MoU for cooperation in the field of election management will  be signed with the Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE) of Tunisia as well. Election Commission of India has, so far, signed MOUs with twenty-seven Election Management Bodies and International Organizations viz.  Afghanistan, Australia, Bhutan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Brazil, Chile,  Fiji, Georgia, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Republic of  Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Libya, Maldives, Mauritius, Mexico,  Moldova, Myanmar, Nepal,  Russia,  South Africa,  Suriname, Yemen, Zambia and United Nations, Intl. IDEA & IFES.

The International Conference is being organised with the purpose of sharing the experience of different EMB’s, International Institutions and Experts with regard to analysis of barriers, policy interventions, strategies, programmes, good practices and technological innovation for ‘Strengthening Institutional Capacity’ of EMBs.   The international delegates will also attend the National Voters’ Day Celebrations in New Delhi on 25th  January 2020.

                In its 70th year of inception, Election Commission of India has decided to institute an Annual Lecture Series as a tribute to the first Chief Election Commissioner of India, Shri Sukumar Sen. Sh Sen (1898-1963) commendably conducted the first two General Elections to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, thereby putting India firmly on the map of democracy. The rationale behind instituting the lecture is to make a positive and constructive intervention in the democratic discourse of the nation within the constitutional mandate of the Election Commission of India. 

Former President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, has kindly consented to deliver the first of the Lectures on 23rd January 2020. In 2019, Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of the Republic, was conferred upon him, for his achievements in public affairs. Spanning over a career of more than fifty years, Sh Mukherjee had occupied varied Ministerial posts of Finance, Commerce, External Affairs and Defence Minister at different times. Shri Mukherjee has extensive diplomatic experience and has served on the Board of Governors of Multilateral Institutions such as IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank. Shri Mukherjee is a widely respected savant known for his encyclopedic knowledge of economic, constitutional and historical affairs. A prolific reader, he has authored several books on the Indian economy and the nation building. 

While announcing the institution of Sukumar Sen Memorial Lecture Series on behalf of Election Commission at a book launch in New Delhi on 7th February 2019, Chief Election Commissioner Shri Sunil Arora had observed “It would be Commission's endeavor to involve a wide cross-section of civil society including political parties, media, constitutionalists, legal luminaries, academia etc. This lecture would be delivered by an eminent person from the democratic world, whose contribution for the spread and furtherance of democratic values and ideals is widely known and recognized”.

Shri Sukumar Sen was born on 2 January, 1898. He was educated at Presidency College, Kolkata and University College, London. Shri Sen joined the Indian Civil Services in 1922. During his service, he held several important posts, including as Chief Secretary of West Bengal (1947-1950). He served as the first Chief Election Commissioner of India from 21st March 1950 till his retirement 19th December, 1958. He conducted the first two Lok Sabha elections of India held in 1952 and 1957 simultaneously with the Legislative Assembly Elections based on universal adult franchise under challenging circumstances and little precedence to guide him.

Shri Sen is also credited with conducting the first general elections in the then Sudan in November-December, 1953 as the Chairman of the International Election Commission. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan for his distinguished contribution to public life. He was one of the earliest recipients of that award in 1954. 

On this occasion a reprint of the Report on India's First Election would be released by Shri Pranab Mukherjee as also a postal stamp in memory of Shri Sukumar Sen would be unveiled.

            Addressing the Observers, Chief Election Commissioner Sh. Sunil Arora advised them to maintain close coordination with officers teams deputed in the field and to remain accessible at all times. Shri Arora particularly asked them to follow ECI's guidelines with full sincerity and devotion and adhere to code of ethics with no laxity at all in performing assigned tasks. He asked the Observers to ensure due Assured Minimum Facilities at all the Polling booths.

Familiarisation with laid down instructions and attention to specific details of additional facilities being initiated in Delhi Elections, such as Absentee Voter Facilitation to essential services categories, 80+ aged voters as also marked PwDs; QR code reader on Photo Voter Slips, would aid efficacy of Observers assigned the duty. He advised officers to be proactive to redress complaints and ensure impartiality while discharging their duties.

             Speaking to the group, Election Commissioner Sh Sushil Chandra drew the attention of the Officers that as Observers they have a statutory duty to perform on behalf of Election Commission of India. He said the Officers so deputed, need to be neutral and impartial in discharge of their duties and be the actual face of ECI on the ground. He stated that the Observers should ensure strict compliance of ECI's rules and Standard Operating Procedures like amenities at the polling booths, vulnerability mapping or compliance of Non-Bailable Warrants, deposition of licensed arms and strict compliance of expenditure management norms.

            The half-day long briefing sessions held today had comprehensive briefing by the Secretary General ECI Shri Umesh Sinha on Election Planning, Security Management & SVEEP aspects; by the Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Shri Sandeep Saxena, who is also Delhi State in-charge at ECI, on Electoral Roll issues and IT applications; session on EVM VVPAT Management System by Deputy Election Commissioner Shri Sudeep Jain and on legal issues by Deputy Election Commissioner Shri Chandra Bhushan Kumar.

            It was particularly pointed out to the Observers that while in recent Jharkhand elections, Postal Ballot Facilitation for the Octogenarians and PwD voters was introduced on pilot basis, the optional facility of being able to cast vote from home would be extended across all 70 ACs of Delhi to voters above age of 80 years; marked PwDs as also to persons employed in essential services like Delhi Metro on-duty staff on polling day, Northern Railways Transportation s (Passenger and Freight ) services as also media persons for whom authority letters have been issued for covering poll-day activities in NCT of Delhi.

While reporting on the actual campaign, a newspaper may not leave out any important point raised by a candidate and make an attack on his or her opponent.
	Election campaign along communal or caste lines is banned under the election rules. Hence, the Press should eschew reports, which tend to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between people on the ground of religion, race, caste, community or language.
	The Press should refrain from publishing false or critical statements in regard to the personal character and conduct of any candidate or in relation to the candidature or withdrawal of any candidate or his candidature, to prejudice the prospects of that candidate in the elections. The Press shall not publish unverified allegations against any candidate/party.


iv. The Press shall not accept any kind of inducement, financial or otherwise,  to project a candidate/party. It shall not accept hospitality or other facilities  offered to them by or on behalf of any candidate/party.

v. The Press is not expected to indulge in canvassing of a particular  candidate/party. If it does, it shall allow the right of reply to the other  candidate/party.

vi. The Press shall not accept/publish any advertisement at the cost of public  exchequer regarding achievements of a party/ government in power.

                Registration of political parties is governed by the provisions of Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. An association seeking registration under the said Section has to submit an application to the Commission within a period of 30 days following the date of its formation, as per the guidelines prescribed by the Commission in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 324 of the Constitution of India and Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

In order to enable applicants to track the status of the application, the Commission has launched a “Political Parties Registration Tracking Management System(PPRTMS)”.  The salient feature in the PPRTMS is that the applicant, who is applying for party registration from 1st January, 2020 will be able to track the progress of his/her application and will get status update through SMS and e-mail.  The status can be tracked through the Commission’s portal at link https://pprtms.eci.gov.in/. The Commission in the month of December, 2019,  has amended the guidelines and issued a Press Note dated 02.12.2019 regarding registration of political party for the information of the general public.  The new guidelines is effective from 1st January, 2020 and is available on the Commission’s website http://eci.gov.in.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials met today with  Chief Minister of Goa, Shri Pramod Sawant alongwith his Cabinet colleagues and senior State Government officials.

The Commission observed that:


	Goa has a population of 1.459 million, making it India's fourth smallest State in terms of Population (after Sikkim, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh). The population has a growth rate of 8.23% per decade.
	There are 394 people for each square kilometer of land which is higher than national average 382 per km2. Goa is the state with highest proportion of urban population with 62.17% of the population living in urban areas. 
	Estimates put the migrant, or non-Goan, population at 20% of the population, with a State Government study projecting that by 2021 the migrant community will outnumber the native population. 
	Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states, two and a half times that of the country. In 2018-19, per capita NSDP of the State was Rs. 4,67,998 against per capita income of Rs. 1,26,406 for India. 
	It was ranked the best-placed state by the Eleventh Finance Commission for its infrastructure and ranked on top for the best quality of life in India by the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators.
	 Goa is also one of the few states in India to achieve 100 percent rural electrification.
	In 2018-19, the share of primary, secondary and tertiary sector in GSVA (current prices 2011) of the State was 9.6, 46.3 and 34.3%, respectively.
	The State’s share in inter-se devolution had risen from 0.26 during 2010-15 (as recommended by FC-XIII) to 0.37 during 2015-20 (as recommended by FC-XIV). 


 

The Commission was appreciative of the fact that: 


	In 2017-18, the Own Tax Revenue to GSDP of the State was 6.7%, which is sixth highest among all States. Also, the NTR as the percent to GSDP is 4.3 and ORR as a percent to GSDP is 11 which is highest among all the States.
	The annual growth rate as a percent to GSDP has been on the higher side when compared to GDP growth rate from 2014-15 onwards. 
	State Government has witnessed revenue surplus to GSDP in all the years since 2011-12 till 2018-19 except for the years 2012-13 and 2013 -14. 
	The Per Capita Tax Revenue is 7.34 as a % to the PCI for 2017-18. 
	The social indicators including literacy rate, decennial growth rate, Total Fertility Rate (TFR), IMR, Birth Rate, Death Rate are well above the national average.
	The debt-GSDP ratio of the State was 26.32% in 2017-18, which is well above the average of the all States i.e 25.51 %. The State is ranked at 12th among all the States for the year 2017-18.   
	Solid waste management and sewage treatment related issues.
	Tourism development.


 

The Finance Commission was concerned about:


	In the recent past, Goa has been facing the problem of slower own tax revenue growth. The slowdown in the economy is affecting the revenue potential of the State.  The nominal GSDP growth in Goa has fallen to 8.5 percent in 2015-16 from an average of 12 percent in the last decade.


 


	 The State Government may need to make progress towards increasing capital expenditure, eliminating AT&D losses in the power sector, and improving the quality of such expenditure in generating future income streams.


 


	The State Government has been irregular in constitution of State Finance Commission and not implemented recommendations of any two SFCs so far constituted in spite of having 190 Village Panchayats and 14 ULBs. 


 


	All the functions mentioned under Eleventh and Twelfth Schedule of the Constitution have not yet been fully devolved to the local bodies.


 

The Commission desired to know about the natural disaster preparedness of the State.  The Commission also sought information on how the State dealt with the huge tourist arrival (both domestic & international) in Goa each year.

Earlier the Commission had held a meeting with the representatives of the Political Parties of the State of Goa including BJP, INC, AAP, MGP, GFP and CPI.  Cutting across party lines, all parties had put forth issues and problems facing Goa currently.

The State Government gave a detailed presentation of the current fiscal situation of Goa and its requirements for funds.  The State has submitted a demand for grant of Rs.6333.32 crores in addition to the overall tax devolution. 

The Commission has assured to look into all matters and issues, specifically solid waste management, tourism development, etc. before making its recommendations to the Union Government.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials met today with the representatives of the Trade and Industry bodies in Goa.

The Commission was informed that:


	Growth rate of GSDP (at current prices, 2011) of State has fluctuated widely during 2012-13 to 2018-19 compared to GDP (at current prices, 2011) of India. 


 



 


	The share of primary, secondary and tertiary sector in GSVA (current prices, 2011) of the State was 9.6%, 46.3%, & 34.3%, respectively, in 2018-19. 



	The State ranks 19th position in India as far as ‘Ease of Doing Business’ is concerned (2019).
	During the last three years the year–on-year tourists’ arrival is growing at the pace of about 20%. In 2017, there were 68,95,234 domestic tourists and 8,90,459 foreign tourists which is more than four times the population of the State.

                The 15th Finance Commission headed by Chairman, Shri N.K. Singh alongwith its Members and senior officials met today with the representatives of the Rural Local Bodies of Goa.

The Commission was informed that:


	       First State Finance Commission was constituted in 1999 and Government of Goa had accepted its recommendations in November, 2001.
	     Second State Finance Commission submitted its report in December, 2007, but Government had not accepted the recommendations of the Second State Finance Commission.  
	     Third State Finance Commission was constituted in January, 2017 (10 years after submission of report of the Second Finance Commission) and has not submitted the report after completion of three years.


          The main Recommendations of 14th Finance Commission were:


	   Grants recommended by 14th Finance Commission to Rural Local Body Rs. 134 crore (Rs. 120 crore Basic Grant and Rs. 14 crore Performance Grant).  Out of Rs. 120 crore (Basic Grant), Goa has received only Rs. 50 crore by the end of 31st March, 2019. (42% of the grant recommended by 14th Finance Commission). 



	   Out of Rs. 14 crore Performance Grant, Goa has received only Rs. 2.62 crore in 2016-17 (First year of performance Grant). (20% of the grant recommended by 14th Finance Commission).


The 15th Finance Commission desired to know the reason(s) for not accepting the recommendations of 2nd SFC.  It also sought information as to why submission of report of Third State Finance Commission was awaited even after three years of its constitution. In view of the fact that in 2016-17 & 2017-18, 191 Village Panchayats had generated Rs. 24 crore and Rs. 25 crore respectively as Tax Revenue, the Commission has asked for the status of Accounts of Panchayati Raj Institutions.

          The Department of Health & Family Welfare proposed to the 15th Finance Commission for untied funds to help in funding gaps in Primary Health care in the States.  This, they said, would help States with significant funding needs and health lag to get more funds and priorities spending on health.

          The Ministry also asked for performance based incentives – a Composite Health Index to be utilized to encourage States to demonstrate performance on year on year basis.  The Ministry proposed a collaborative multi-sectoral non-ministerial approach by incorporating health impact considerations into the Government’s decision making process – Health in All Policies.

          The Ministry projected the requirement of funds for a primary care for the purpose of addressing shortfall in infrastructure, health care professionals, supporting AB-HWCs, National Ambulance Service, and Funds for Medicines and Diagnostics.  For a 5 year period, total of Rs.5,38,305.38/- crores fund has been projected. 

          In the light of the discussions today the Commission has asked the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in consultation with Member, NitiAayog, Dr. V.K. Paul to come up with revised proposals on the optimum utilization of finances in respect of sectors specific grants.

The Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar today held a bilateral meeting with the Brazilian Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply Ms. Tereza Cristina Correa da Costa Dias at KrishiBhawan in New Delhi to discuss various bilateral trade opportunities, interests and issues. Both Ministers affirmed that agriculture is a priority for both Brazil and India and resolved to strengthen cooperation in the agriculture and allied sectors.  The strong bilateral relations between India and Brazil have continued to strengthen and deepen over the years and were reiterated.  The two countries have similar aspirations and developmental challenges especially for small and marginal farmers which makes the two countries natural partners.  

Shri Tomar expressed pleasure at intensification of cooperation in the agriculture sector and of the warm, friendly and mutually beneficial relationship between India and Brazil. Shri Tomar said that India is honoured to have President of Brazil as the Chief Guest for Republic Day and the Brazilian Minister for Agriculture being part of high level delegation is an indicator of the importance attached by the Brazilian Government to cooperation in the area of Agriculture and allied sectors.

Shri Tomar said that India and Brazil are Strategic Partners and the bilateral relationship is one of the oldest in the Latin American region and has continued to strengthen and deepen over the years.  As two large democracies and growing economies India and Brazil have similar aspirations and developmental challenges which make us natural partners. He further added that there is a keen interest on the part of leadership of both the countries to take the relationship to the next level.He said that thecooperation is multifaceted and is not only in the bilateral arenabut also in multilateralfora such asBRICS and IBSA and particularly theUN.

Shri Tomar said that the bilateral trade at US$ 1045 million in 2018-19 is way below potential and is not reflective of the strengths of both economies and there is a need to encourage more trade given the huge complementarities and synergies that exist between India andBrazil.He said that India is interested in diversifying the commodity basket with regard to agricultural exports to Brazil. Brazil imports onions, fresh and dried grapes, wheat and meslin, maize, rice, soyabean and cotton from other countries of the world. The Union Agriculture Minister requested Brazil to explore sourcing these agricultural items fromIndia.

Shri Tomar further discussed several issued of mutual importance including the Market access issues and Brazilian investmentin India.Brazil and India agreed to work towards expeditious resolving of market access to other agricultural products of interest toeach other.   Both Ministers were committed to resolving outstanding issues through continuous interaction.Shri Tomar in conclusion expressed confidence that in the coming years, India’s relationship with Brazil will further gain in strength. Both the sides agreed to expeditiously finalize the Work Plan under the MoU between ICAR and Brazilian Agricultural Research Cooperation (EMBRAPA) to ensure organized and sustained engagements in the suggested sectors.

She further said that the fundamental objective is to identify various issues and synergise ways and means to overcome them including tariffs which will help in the progress of both the nations. 

Ms. Dias said that both countries share a common challenge with a huge part of the population being engaged in agriculture and most of them being small and marginal farmers with low income and lack of market access and very little access to new technology and innovations.   She said that if we can manage to overcome the bottlenecks, it will provide a major impetus to boosting trade and business ties. She said that Wheat, Rice, Millets, Sorghum are some of the products that India would like to export to Brazil and that she will try to move forward on this as far as possible. 

Ms. Dias also said that Brazil has a Zero Tariff Program which has a quota of 7.5 Lakh Tons which can be effectively utilised by India for furthering their exports to Brazil. She thanked India for opening the market for Sesame seeds of which India is a major exported but Brazil can complement Indian production especially during the period between harvests. She also said that Brazil is keep on exporting Avocadoes and Citrus to India and is looking forward to expand the relationship in other products as well. She also added that technology should be harnessed and teleconferencing should be used to further trade talks between the two nations before the next delegation meet.

The Ministry for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare organized the first National consultative workshop on Strengthening Agri- Logistics in e-National Agriculture Market (e-Nam) in New Delhi today. Speaking on the occasion Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar said that agriculture is very important for the country as there is a large population engaged in agriculture. He stated that strengthening agriculture and the rural economy will strengthen India so that the country can face challenges victoriously. The government is also committed to realizing the Prime Minister’s vision of doubling farmers income by 2022. 

Shri Tomar said that government is committed to strengthening the economy and infrastructure of rural areas so that every facility is available to villagers at their door-step. He lauded the efforts of farmers, Agricultural Scientists and the Central and State Governments for achieving self sufficiency in foodgrains, horticulture and animal husbandry. He suggested that the disparity between small farmers and big farmers should be bridged and benefits of technology and various schemes should reach the small and marginal farmers.

Shri Tomar told the audience the greatest challenge in present times is to provide farmers the correct price for their produce. For this the Prime Minister has envisioned e-NAM (Electronic National Agriculture Market) that envisages a pan-India e-trading facility for agricultural commodities through integration of existing APMCs. Market integration through e-platform facilitates transparent and competitive bidding by enabling inter-mandi trade of the agricultural produce thereby giving advantage to the farmers for better price discovery. Presently 585 markets across 16 states and 2 Union territories have been integrated on e-platform. It is expected that 415 other mandis will soon be integrated. On this portal more than 1.65 crore farmers and 1.27 lakh traders have registered. Through this platform trading of Rs. 91000 crores has already taken place and in the near future it is expected to reach 1 lakh crores.

Strengthening the e-NAM platform and making it reliable is the constant effort of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The Minister said that it is priority of the government that small farmers in large numbers join this platform. On strengthening Agri- Logistics the Minister suggested that Agri- Logistics starts with harvesting. Along with harvesting cleaning, grading, segregating, quality inspection, packaging and marketing have to be done so that the journey from production to consumer is completed. The workshop addressed all these problems that farmers face and the suggestions given by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

Shri Tomar emphasized that technology should reach the farmer, micro irrigation should be used to save water, there should be less usage of chemical fertilizers, input cost should be reduced, farmers should get a good price via MSP. He said that schemes like PM-KisanSammanYojana, MaN-DhanYojana, PM-FasalBimaYojana are showing good results. He expressed hope that through this workshop the entire food value chain could be linked resulting in an effective Agri-Logistics infrastructure which will help strengthening e-NAM for the farmers. 

In the National Consultative Workshop more than 200 prominent professionals, educationists, practitioners of Agri-Logistics, Cleaning, Grading, productivity analysis, quality management, warehousing and transportation and logistics start-ups participated. Senior officials from various states across the country were present. Union Minister of state for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Purushottam Rupala and Agriculture Secretary Shri Sanjay Aggrawal also participated in the workshop.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi distributed Agriculture Minister’s Krishi Karman Awards for Progressive Farmers and Commendation Awards to the states at a public meeting in Tumkur, Karnataka today. He also released the 3rd installment of PM Kisan (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi) of Rs 2000 for the period December 2019 - March 2020. This will benefit approximately 6 crore beneficiaries and distributed Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) to select farmers of Karnataka.  Prime Minister will also hand over Certificates to beneficiaries under PM Kisan from 8 States / UTs. Prime Minister also handed over the keys of Deep Sea fishing Vessels and Fishing Vessel Transponders to select farmers of Tamil Nadu.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that it is a great privilege for him to see Annadata - our peasant brothers and sisters, in the new year, the beginning of a new decade. On behalf of 130 crore countrymen, the Prime Minister thanked ther country’s farmers for their toil.

The Prime Minister said that the land of Karnataka also witnessed a historic moment when money under the PM-Kisan scheme has been distributed directly into the personal accounts of nearly 6 Crore Farmers in the country. Prime Minister said a total of Rs 12 Thousand Crores has been deposited under the 3rd tranche of the scheme.

He hoped that the States that haven't implemented the 'PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana', will do it and political parties will rise over politics to help the farmers in their States.

PM recalled that there was also a period in the country, when one rupee was sent for the poor in the country and only 15 paise out of it reached the beneficiaries. And now he said that the money is reaching the poor directly without the intervention of the middlemen.

Prime Minister said that the irrigation projects that have been stalled for several decades are now being implemented. He also said that the centre has always given priority to the interests of our farmers with the schemes like crop insurance, soil health cards and 100% neem coated urea.

Prime Minister said that due to the efforts of the government, both the production and export of spices from India has increased considerably. “Spice production in India has increased by more than 2.5 million tons, so the export has also increased from about Rs 15 thousand crore to about Rs 19 thousand crore.”

He said that apart from horticulture, South India also has a large share in the production of pulses, oil and coarse grains.

Prime Minister said, “Seed hubs have been built to promote pulses production in India, of which more than 30 centers are located in Karnataka, Andhra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana itself.”

Referring to the Government’s efforts on Fisheries sector, Prime Minister said the government is working at three levels to strengthen the sector.

First - Encouraging fisheries in villages through financial assistance to fishermen.

Second- Modernizing the fishing boats under the Blue Revolution Scheme.

And third - Constructing modern infrastructure related to fish trade and business.

Prime Minister said, “fishermen have been linked to the Kisan Credit Card facility. New fishing harbors are being built in large rivers and in the sea for the convenience of fish farmers. A special fund of Rs 7.50 thousand crore has also been created for modern infrastructure. Fishermen's boats are being modernized for deep sea fishing and navigation devices are being installed in boats for the protection of fishermen with the help of ISRO.”

Keeping in view the nutritional security of the country, PM requested to create a new category in the Krishi Karman Award, for Nutri Cereals, Horticulture and Organic Agriculture. This will give impetus to people and states doing better work in these areas, he added.

On the occasion, the Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar informed that a toll-free number for the beneficiaries of PM-Kisan Yojana, 155261 has been started at which the farmers will be able to know their payment status. He added that it shows the Government’s commitment to social security for small and marginal farmers, that two important welfare schemes – PM-Kisan which provides income support and PM- Kisan Maandhan-Yojana (PM-KMY) for pension assistance are being implemented. The Minister added that a mobile application is also being developed for ease of access of PM Kisan Portal facilities for farmers.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval as under: 

 

(i)     Shutting down the operations of the plant/unit of Hindustan Fluorocarbons Limited (HFL) and closure of the company.

 

(ii)   Separating the employees rendered surplus through VRS/VSS, after payment of all their outstanding salary/wages and statutory dues, except for the skeletal staff required to implement the closure of the company. Employees not opting for VRS will be retrenched as per Industrial Disputes Act.

 

(iii)   Grant of interest free loan of Rs.77.20 crore by the Govt. to HFL for expenditure exclusively on closure of HFL viz. implementation of VRS/VSS, payment of outstanding salary & statutory dues, etc. and salary/wages and administrative expenses of HFL's skeletal staff to be retained for implementing the closure of HFL.

 

(iv)   Above interest free loan of Rs.77.20 crore is to be repaid to Gol from the disposal of land and other assets of HFL after settling all closure related liabilities. If the land/ assets sale proceeds are not sufficient to repay the loan amount, then the balance loan amount is to be written off.

 

(v)     After repayment of the loan of Rs.77.20 crore and settlement of all other closure related liabilities of HFL, surplus proceeds from disposal of land and assets will be used for repayment of HFL's outstanding Gol loans (Rs.15.80 crore) and interest, with freezing of interest up to 31.03.2019. Full or part of the principal loan amount and interest thereon remaining unpaid due to insufficient sale proceeds is to be written off/waived.

 

(vi)   Appointment of NBCC (India) Ltd. as Land Management Agencies (LMA) for facilitating disposal of HFL's land assets subject to outcome of the decision of Telangana Govt./TSIIC on purchasing land of HFL.

 

(vii)    Disposal of plant/machinery and movable assets will be done by HFL through e-auction by MSTC Ltd.

 

HFL has only one plant/unit located at Rudraram, District Sangareddy in Telangana.

 

Financial Implications: 

Financial implications of the proposal for closure of HFL involves providing financial support of Rs.77.20 crore (cash) to HFL in the form of interest free loan for settling closure related liabilities of HFL viz. (a) implementation of VRS/VSS, payment of outstanding salary & statutory dues, payment of suppliers/contractors/utilities dues and repayment of SBI working capital credit and (b) salary/wages and administrative expenses of HFL skeletal staff to be retained for implementing the closure plan for two years. Above interest free loan is proposed to be repaid from the proceeds of the disposal of land and other assets of HFL after settling all the liabilities relating to closure of the company. If the land / assets sale proceeds are not sufficient to fully repay the loan amount, then the balance loan amount is to be written off.

 

Implementation schedule: 

Taking date of receipt of CCEA approval as ‘T’-

 


	Notice to Employees for VRS/VSS: T+10 days.
	Request for budgetary support / bridge loan from D/o Expenditure: T+15 days.

	Application to SEBI/BSE for exit option to shareholders and Voluntary winding up and Delisting under provisions of Companies Act, Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code and SEBI regulations: T + 400 days.


 

Impact: 

With unviable scale of operations, very old plants & technology and only one revenue earning product (HCFC-22) but of no strategic significance, sustainable revival of HFL is not economically viable. Moreover, the inevitable reduction in HCFC-22 quota of HFL in 2020 will make the company's operations completely non-viable from March, 2020 onwards. Closure of the company's operations will not only avoid any future risks / liabilities but also protect the interest and welfare of HFL employees by separating them through VRS/VSS. Thereafter, disposal of the company's land assets will enable their redeployment for more productive use which can attract both domestic and foreign investments.  However, interest and welfare of employees rendered surplus will be protected by payment of all their outstanding salary & statutory dues and giving VRS / VSS compensation to them as per DPE guidelines.

 

Background: 

Hindustan Fluorocarbons Limited (HFL) is a subsidiary company of Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd. (HOCL), a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the administrative control of the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals. HFL is engaged in the manufacture of Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (PTFF) and Chloro Di Fluoro Methane (HCFC-22 or CFM-22). The company has been making losses since 2013-14 and has negative net worth. As on 31.3.2019, it had accumulated losses of Rs.62.81 crore and negative net worth of (-)Rs.43.20 crore. It was also registered with the erstwhile Board for Industrial and Financial Construction (BIFR) as a sick company.

 

HFL manufactures HCFC-22 and also uses the same for conversion to PTFE. Due to uneconomic plant capacity and old technology, conversion of HCFC-22 to PTFE is not financially viable and the company is constrained to sell higher quantity of HCFC- 22 directly as refrigerant gas. Under the provisions of Montreal Protocol on phasing out of ozone depleting substances, HFL's HCFC-22 non-feedstock production quota is only about 392 MT per calendar year which was enhanced to 1100 MT during the last 3 years by the Ministry of Environment Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC) based on the exemption request of this Department. The HCFC-22 quota is to be reduced further by 25% from calendar year 2020 and the MoEFCC is not likely to agree to any further exemptions for HFL. The reduced HCFC-22 quota of about 282 MT would be sufficient for plant operations only up to March / April, 2020, and, thereafter, HFL would be forced to shutdown its plant for the remaining months of the year. Since HFL's operations are not likely to be sustainable after March, 2020 onwards, it is necessary to expeditiously close down the operations of the company and separate its employees through VRS/VSS.

                The Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda launched the ""APNA UREA - SonaUgle"" brand of Hindustan Urvarak&Rasayan Limited (HURL) at a function here today. On the occasion, he also unveiled the Company’s logo.

HURL is Joint Venture Company promoted by the three Maharatna Companies i.e. Coal India Limited (CIL), NTPC Limited (NTPC) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) as the lead promoters with FCIL and HFCL as other two partners.

With the objective of making the country self-reliant in Urea, the Governmentapproved in 2016 the revival of three sick Urea plants located at Gorakhpur, Sindri and Barauni. The task of the revival of these three Units has been undertaken by HURL. “The Prime Minister has directed for the revival of five major sick/shutdown fertilizer plants, three of which have been undertaken by HURL. The other two plants at Ramagundam and Talcherwill also commence production soon,” said Shri Gowda. “We are importing 70-80 LMT fertilizer every year. After the commissioning of these five units, the total production of Urea will increase by 63.5 Lakh Metric Tonne Per Annum (LMTPA),” he added.

Lauding HURL for setting in place the delivery system and supply chain ahead of schedule, the Minister encouraged the Company’s Board to continue the momentum and hoped the commissioning of the three plants will also be advanced.

Speaking on the occasion, the Secretary, Department of Fertilizers, Shri ChhabilendraRoul stressed on the balanced use of fertilizers including organic ingredients and micro-nutrients.

The HURL is being looked as a major emerging player in Urea market due to revival of the three closed units in 2021 having total installed production capacity of 38.1 LMT of Neem Coated Urea per annum. The Company will establish and operate state-of-the-art environment friendly and energy efficient Natural Gas based new Fertilizer Complexes with the annual installed capacity of 1.27 MMTPA neem coated Urea at each of the three locations which are expected to be commissioned in February 2021 (Gorakhpur, UP) and May 2021 (Barauni and Sindri). The feedstock to the plants i.e. Natural Gas will be supplied by GAIL under the Pooled Price Mechanism.

The commissioning of the HURL’s three Units in the states of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand will open forward and backward linkages for business activity in the Eastern part of India. It will be instrumental in opening new avenues for generation of income and employment in the Eastern part of our country.

The other two Urea Units being revived are Ramagundam unit by M/s. Ramagundam Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited (RFCL), a Joint Venture of National Fertilizers Limited (NFL), EIL & FCIL, and Talcher unit by M/s. Talcher Fertilizers Limited (TFL), a Joint Venture of Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited (RCF), CIL, GAIL & FCIL.

The details of the expected commissioning dates of the above units are as follows:

                The following is a rebuttal regarding the issue of import of Urea raised by ShriUttam Gupta in his article in Financial Express dated 13.01.2020.

Introduction

There are two main agricultural seasons in India – ‘Kharif’ from 1st April to 30th September and ‘Rabi’ from 1st October to 31st March. The fertilizer requirement (including of Urea) for a season is determined by DAC&FW in consultation with representatives of States/UTs agriculture department before the beginning of a season and communicated to DoF. 

Before the beginning of each agricultural season, the Steering Committee of Secretaries (SCOS) comprising of Secretary (Fertilizers) as Chairman, Chairman Railway Board, Secretary (Commerce), Secretary (Expenditure), Secretary (Agriculture) and Secretary (Shipping) as its members (AS&FA, DoF is also a special invitee to the Committee), considers the requirement of Urea for the season determined by DAC&FW, projected indigenous production and expected UOTA imports. Based on its analysis it decides the overall quantity of urea required to be imported on Government Account in a season and authorizes Department of Fertilizers to determine the timing, quantity and STE to import urea on government account, as and when necessary, for ensuring adequate availability of urea in the country.

 

DoF’s Mandate

DoF is responsible for ensuring adequate and timely supply of fertilizers throughout the country. In order to bridge the gap between the assessed requirement of urea for an agricultural season as determined by DAC&FW and the indigenous production of Urea plus imports under Urea offtake Agreement (UOTA) of GoI with OMIFCO, the Department of Fertilizers imports urea on government account. At present, as per DGFT Foreign Trade policy, import of urea for agriculture purposes is a canalized item and can be imported only through the State Trading Enterprises (STEs) as notified by DGFT from time to time. Currently, MMTC, STC and RCF are the notified STEs.

Process of Urea Import

Since the mandate of DoF is to ensure adequate and timely availability of Fertilizers, In this regard, to bridge the gap between the requirement and indigenous production of Urea plus imports under Urea offtake Agreement (UOTA) of GoI with OMIFCO, the Department of Fertilizers imports urea on government account. The concerned STE’s are authorized on rotation basis to procure imported Urea for DoF through competitive bidding process. 

In the present context, since the STEs are Public Sector Undertakings, they are required to adhere to all other directions/guidelines of the GoI on tendering and procurement to ensure international competitive bidding and secure competitive prices. 

The DoF does not import Urea on its discretion. There is well designed scrutiny of the proposals to go for any lot of imports. Ascribing discretion and vested interest to DoF functionaries show lack of appreciation of efforts by them in ensuring timely supply of fertilizers to the farming community.

                Shri Hardeep S. Puri, Minister of State(I/C), Ministry of Civil Aviation in a Press Conference today informed that the newly constituted Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM), headed by Hon’ble Home Minister and comprising of Union Ministers of Commerce & Industry, Finance & Corporate Affairs and Civil Aviation, as members, has approved the release of the Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) for inviting Expression of Interest (EOI) from the Interested Bidders (IBs) for Strategic Disinvestment of Air India.  He informed that the Government has released the PIM for seeking EOI for strategic disinvestment of Air India.  

Addressing the Media, Shri Puri informed that Air India along with Air India Express has 146 aircraft in its fleet, 82 of which are owned by it; have worldwide bilateral rights and spread over domestic as well as international slots and added that   During 2018-19, both Air India and Air India Express carried around 26.2 million passengers.  Air India and Air India Express have average aircraft age of 8 years which is among the youngest fleet.   27 Boeing-787 with Air India are as young as 5 years and 27 Airbus-320 Neo (CFM engines) are as young as 2 years.  Air India and Air India Express have almost 51% share of the international traffic to/from India among Indian carriers and 18 % share including global carriers (ex-India).

Pointing out that Air India has coverage of 98 destinations with 56 domestic and 42 international destinations, Shri Puri informed that Air India offers 75 additional destinations through its secondary network of code share operations.  Air India and Air India Express have a combined revenue of Rs.30,632 crore in 2018-19, which is the highest among Indian carriers.  Air India + Air India Express employee cost as % of revenue is about 11% which is comparable to Indian carriers and much lower to International carriers.  AISATS provides in-house ground handling facilities at key metro airports – Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram and Mangalore.  Even after infusion of about Rs.30,500 crore as per Turn Around Plan since 2012, Air India has been running into losses year after year.  Due to its accumulated debt of about Rs.60,000 crore, its financial position is in a very fragile condition. 

                                                                    

            A few of the key decisive parameters in the current PIM include:


	Transfer of management control and sale of 100% shares of Air India along with Air India’s 100% stake in its subsidiary, Air India Express Limited and 50% stake in joint venture, AISATS.

                In order to facilitate the identification of civil drones and drone operators, a one-time opportunity for voluntary disclosure of such drones and drone operators is now being provided by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA). The persons in possession of drones are required to submit the information to the government, starting from 14th January 2020 by visiting the Digital Sky portal at https://digitalsky.dgca.gov.in. Drones and Drones operators have to obtain Unique Identification Number (UIN), Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP) and other operational requirements as per the guidelines issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) which regulates the use of drones in the Indian Airspace. 

It was brought to the notice of the Government of India that such drones and drone operators are not complying with the CAR mentioned abovThe conditions of No Permission-No Takeoff (NPNT) as envisaged in the aforesaid CAR are not mandatory for this purpose whereas if drones are operated without due permission, the aforesaid process of CAR is violated. The deadline to submit the required information to the Government is 31st January 2020. 

On successful submission of voluntary disclosure of possessing drone, a Drone Acknowledgement Number (DAN) and an Ownership Acknowledgement Number (OAN) will be issued online which will assist in validation of operations of drones in India. However, the DAN or OAN does not confer any right to operate a drone(s) in India, if it does not fulfill the provisions given in the CAR. Further, ownership of drone(s) in India without a valid DAN or OAN shall invite penal action as per applicable laws. 

Any clarification or additional information in this regard may be sought from Digital Sky Help desk at support-digisky[at]gov[dot]in.

                Moving ahead after the recent amendments MMDR Act 1957 and the CMSP Act 2015,the Ministry of Coal is initiating the process for auction of coal mines for sale of coal.Expected to be held in multiple tranches, the first tranche is proposed to be launched in the current financial year. The Union Ministerfor Coal and Mines ShriPralhad Joshi said that this is a historic step towards Ease of Doing Business and democratization of coal and mining sectors.

A Discussion Paper containing the draft methodology and key bidding terms and conditions on the auction of coal mines for sale of coal has been uploaded on https://www.coal.nic.in/ and  https://www.coal.nic.in/content/nominated-authority.  A tentative list of mines along with mine-specific details  are also provided at https://coalblock-is.cmpdi.co.in/pages/dashboard.php

The Ministry of Coalhas urged interested stakeholders to view the Discussion Paper and the mine specific details and submit their views/ suggestions, indicate their preferences for the mines to be considered for auction under the first tranche, as per the instructions provided in the Discussion Paper.

The Ordinance promulgated last week, amended the CM(SP) Act, 2015 and MMDR Act, 1957,whereby the restriction on prior experience in coal mining was removed thus enabling wider participation in auction of coal mines. Further, the Ordinance also enables auction of unexplored and partially explored coal blocks for mining through prospecting license-cum-mining Lease (PL-cum-ML).These steps are expected to result in opening up of the coal sector completely for commercial mining to local as well as global firms. This would further boost economic growth and employment generation.

                The ordinance for amendment in the MMDR Act 1957 and the CMSP Act 2015 has been promulgated. The Union Cabinet had earlier approved the amendments intending to open up new areas of growth in the coal & mining sector.

The amendments in the Acts would enable the following:


	Enhancing the  ease of doing business
	Democratization of coal mining sector by opening it up to anyone willing to invest.
	Offering of unexplored and partially explored coal blocks for mining through prospecting license-cum-mining Lease (PL- cum-ML).
	Promoting Foreign Direct Investment in the coal mining  sector by removing the restriction and eligibility criteria for participation. 
	Allowing of successful bidder/allottee to utilise mined coal in any of the plant of its subsidiary or holding company
	Attracting large investment in coal mining sector as restrictions of end use has been dropped.


The details are as given below:


	Amendments in respect of Ministry of Coal


Amendment 1:            To provide for allocation of coal blocks for composite prospecting licence-cum-mining lease (PL-cum-ML)

Earlier, there was no provision for grant of composite prospecting licence-cum-mining lease (PL-cum-ML) in respect of coal/ lignite. A coal / lignite block could be either be allocated for PL or for ML. The Amendment has enabled the allocation of coal blocks for composite prospecting licence-cum-mining lease (PL-cum-ML) which will help in increasing of the inventory of coal/ lignite blocks for allocation. Coal blocks with different grades and in a wide geographical distribution will now be available for allocation. 

The Sections involved were Section 4(2), 5(1), 8(4), 8(8), 8(9) and 31(2)(b) of the CMSP Act and Section 11A and 13(2) of the MMDR Act

Amendment 2:            Clarifying the power of Central Government to specify the purpose of allocation and that ‘any’ company can participate 

There was lack of clarity earlier in the language of the provisions in the Acts leading to restrictive interpretation of the eligibility conditions in the auction. It has now been clarified that any company selected through auction/ allotment can carry on coal mining operation for own consumption, sale or for any other purposes, as may be specified by the Central Govt. allowing wider participation and competition in auction. 

Thus, the companies which do not possess any prior coal mining experience in India but are financially strong and or have mining experience in other minerals or in other countries can now participate in auction of coal/lignite blocks. This would also allow the implementation of the 100% FDI through automatic route for sale of coal.

The Sections involved are 11A of the MMDR Act and Section 4(2) and 5(1) of the CMSP Act.

Amendment 3:            Flexibility in deciding the end use of Schedule II and III coal mines

Hitherto, the Schedule II and III coal mines could only be auctioned to companies that are engaged in specified end use. Now, the omission of sub-section (3) of Section 4 of CMSP Act has provided flexibility to the Central Govt. in deciding the end use of Schedule II and III coal mines under the CMSP Act. This would allow wider participation in auction of Schedule II and III coal mines, for a variety of purposes such as own consumption, sale or for any other purpose, as may be specified by the Central Govt.

Amendment 4:            Termination of the allocations made under the CMSP Act, their reallocation and compensation

The CMSP Act and the CMSP Rules were silent on subsequent allocation of coal mines upon termination of allocations made under the Act as well as rights and liabilities of the allottee, whose allocation has been terminated. With the amendment of Section 8 (insertion of sub section (13), (14) and (15) in CMSP Act), it is has become possible to provide for allocation of the coal mine to next successful bidder or allottee, subsequent to termination of its allocation along with the matters incidental to it. The Act now also provides for compensation to the allocattee whose allocation has been terminated.

Amendment 5:            Appointment of Designated Custodian in mines under production:

Earlier, there was no provision for appointment of designated custodian for management of the mines under production whose vesting/ allotment order has been cancelled. By amending the Section 18 of the CMSP Act, it is now possible for appointment of designated custodian for management of the mines, apart from Schedule II mines, which have come under production and whose vesting/ allotment order has been cancelled. It therefore addresses the issue of management and operation of the mines after their termination, which have come under production.

Amendment 6:            Dispensing with the requirement of previous approval in certain cases

With the amendment of the Section 5 and 17A of the MMDR Act, the repetitive and redundant provision requiring previous approval of Central government even in cases where the allocation or reservation of coal/ lignite block has been made by the Central Govt. itself has been done away with. This would significantly reduce the  time taken for operationalisation of coal/ lignite mines.

Amendment 7:            Entitlement to successful allocattee to utilise the coal mined in plants of Holding and Subsidiary company:

Earlier a successful allocattee was entitled to utilise the mined coal only in any of its plants. With the amendment of  Section 20(2)of the CMSP Act now the reference of Holding company and Subsidiary company has been added. This would make the successful bidder/allottee entitled to utilise mined coal in any of its plants or plants of its subsidiary or holding company. 

Amendment 8:  Certain Consequential and clarificatory Amendments:

Certain consequential and clarificatory amendments were required in language of various provisions for smooth implementation of the CMSP Act. Section 9 and 20(1) of the CMSP Act have now been amended which has resulted in the clarification of language of Section 9 (related to priority of disbursal) Further, language of Section 20(1) has been clarified to avoid any arrangement between two coal linkage holders as the same is not subject matter of the CMSP Act.


	Amendments in respect of Ministry of Mines


Amendment 1:            Insertion of new section 4B (after section 4A) to enable the Central Govt. to prescribe conditions for ensuring sustained production by the holder of mining leases, who have acquired rights/approvals/clearances etc. transferred from the previous lessee, as per the provisions under section 8B, which is incorporated in this amendment:

The pre-amended MMDR Act, provided a time period of two years for the new lessee for starting the mining operation, whereas the newly introduced section 8B of this Act, provides for deemed acquiring of valid rights /approvals /clearances by the new lessee. The objective of the amendment is to ensure the continuity of production of minerals. Hence, there is need to specify the conditions for production by the new lessee, who will avail benefits of section 8B. Further, the Central Government derives power to prescribe the conditions for the new lessees to commence production without prejudice to the time period of two years for starting the production prescribed in Section 4A. 

Amendment 2:            Amendment of Section 8A by introducing a proviso to clarify the intent of Section 8A(4) of the MMDR Act:

The previous section 8A(4) of the MMDR Act provided for auction of leases on the expiry of the lease. There existed scope for ambiguity about initiating the advance action/process  by the State Government for notifying the expiring leases for auction. With the amendment it has  been clarified that State Government can take up advance steps for auction of blocks before the expiry of lease period. This would ensure that the production of the minerals from such blocks can be seamlessly continued. 

Amendment 3:            Provisions to ensure that the successful bidder of mining leases expiring under Section 8A(5) & 8A(6), shall acquire all valid rights / approvals / clearances; for a period of two years and within which period he/she shall apply for fresh licence:

The working mining leases of Odisha are expiring during 2020. These leases produced about 58 Million Tonne of iron ore, 1.80 Million Tonne of chromite and 0.77 Million Tonne of manganese during the year 2018-19.  Statutory clearances required to start the mining operations for the new leases have to be granted expeditiously to enable the new lessees to continue the mining operations.

The new lessee has to obtain 20 approvals to start the mining operations, of which 9 are related to different Central Govt. Ministries and the remaining are from the State Government. In normal course, the minimum time period required to obtain these approvals vary from two to three years. This whole process would delay the commencement of mining operations by the new lessees. Any delay in commencing the mining operations by the new lessee would adversely  affect the mineral production in the country, which in turn would impact the important downstream industries like steel, cement etc. 

With the insertion of new section 8B (after section 8A) of the MMDR Act, the successful bidders of the mining leases expiring under section 8A(5) & 8A(6) of the MMDR Act, deemed to have acquired all valid rights/ approvals/ clearances/ licenses and the like; for a period of two years and can start mining operation without loss of time. Seamless continuance of mining operations is in public interest as this will prevent disruption in supply of raw material (mineral) to the industries.

The above amendments (1,2&3) pertaining to Mines will promote ease of doing business and will benefit the holders of auctioned brown field mining leases on expiry of their lease period starting from March 2020 and then from March 2030.

Amendment 4:            Provisions to enable the holders of Non-Exclusive Reconnaissance permit of deep seated minerals and other minerals of the national interest to obtain composite licence (PL-cum-ML) or Mining Lease:

The previous legislative provisions did not allow the non-exclusive reconnaissance permit holders to apply for mining lease. The private participation in exploration was therefore negligible. In order to enhance exploration of deep seated minerals a facilitating environment has been envisaged to be provided with the insertion of new proviso after sub-section 2 of section 10C. This amendment would allow NERP holders of deep seated minerals or any minerals of the national interest to apply for composite licence (PL-cum-ML) or Mining Lease. This would hence augment the exploration of the deep seated minerals and minerals of national interest, some of which are strategically important for the country. 

Amendment 5:            Empowers the Central Government to frame rules in respect of newly introduced sections:

The difficulty of the Central Govt. which had to derive power to make rules to implement the provision of the amended Act has now been removed with the insertion of new clauses in sub-section 2 of section 13. This would give the Central Government power to frame subordinate legislation to implement the intent of the Ordinance.

                Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority(APEDA), along with State Government of Andhra Pradesh and one of the largest member exporter of banana, dispatched the first shipment of 890 MTs of high quality bananas,loaded in 43 refrigerated containers,from Tadipatri, Anantpur in Andhra Pradesh to Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) in Mumbai yesterday for export to international markets.

Government of India under Agri Export Policy has notified banana cluster in Anantpur and Kadapa districts of Andhra Pradesh. The exporting company has been able to change the package of practices by providing expertise and technology to help banana growers in Andhra Pradesh for enhancing the quality of banana production. 

More than 500 farmers cultivating bananas in more than 1800 hectares have been trained to boost the production and export of the fruit from Anantpur and nearby districts. 

The long distance of the Andhra Pradesh farms to the export port in Mumbai affects the viability of export shipments due to high transport cost and quality losses during long transit. Efforts have been made for reducing the transit time to Mumbai port by using refrigerated rail containers. 

More than three thousand farmers with an annual production of over 1 lakh MTare being handheld for exports directly. The efforts of APEDA with the support of the State Government and exporters are likely to provide a good opportunity for India to increase its share in world trade of banana.

The Economic Survey 2019-20 says India’s aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy depends critically on promoting “pro-business” policy that unleashes the power of competitive markets to generate wealth, on the one hand, and weaning away from “pro-crony” policy that may favour specific private interests, especially powerful incumbents, on the other hand. The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today. The Survey said that economic events since 1991 provide powerful evidence supporting this crucial distinction. 

The Survey stated that creative destruction has increased significantly after reform. The liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991 unleashed competitive markets and enabled the forces of creative destruction, generating benefits that we still witness today. Creative destruction brings new innovations in the market that serve people better than the old technologies they displace. It brings new firms into the markets, which compete with existing firms and lower prices for consumers. Using the lens of Indian equity markets as captured in the S&P(Standard & Poor’s) BSE Sensex, we can clearly see an increase in market dynamism in the pro-business India of the post-liberalization period. After the market reforms of 1991, Sensex has grown at an accelerating pace. Whereas crossing the first incremental 5000 points took over 13 years and was achieved in 1999, the time taken to achieve each incremental milestone has substantially reduced over the years. Before liberalisation, a Sensex firm expected to stay in it for 60 years, which decreased to only 12 years after liberalisation. Every five years, one-third of Sensex firms are churned out, reflecting the continuous influx of new firms, products and technologies into the economy.

The Survey noted that liberalisation caused a spike in the number of firms churned in the years that immediately followed it, but the churn rate did not decline to pre-liberalization level in later years. New sectors like banks and financials entered the index for the first time, eroding the predominance of the manufacturing sector on the index, placing the services sector on the map for the first time, and reflecting the far-reaching changes that the Indian economy was witnessing in the wake of liberalization.

According to the Survey, the diversity of sectors in the Sensex steadily increased over time following market reforms. The number of Sensex firms in manufacturing has reduced while those in services has increased between 1988 and 2019. Almost 60 per cent of the Indian GDP is attributable to the services.

The Economic Survey 2019-20 observed that pro-crony policies, in contrast to pro-business ones, erode wealth in the economy as cronyism fosters inefficiencies by inhibiting the process of creative destruction. The connected firms proxy firms that may benefit from pro-crony policies. Despite impressive progress in enabling competitive markets, pro-crony policies have destroyed value in the economy. For example, an equity index of connected firms significantly outperformed the market by 7 per cent a year from 2007 to 2010, reflecting abnormal profits extracted at common citizens’ expense. In contrast, the index underperforms the market by 7.5 per cent from 2011, reflecting the inefficiency and value destruction inherent in such firms.


	Survey pointed out that discretionary allocation of natural resources by a Committee provides avenues for rent-seeking and firm owners divert their focus towards tunnelling away these rents rather than furthering productive economic activities. Pro-crony policies as reflected in discretionary allocation of natural resources till 2011 led to rent-seeking by beneficiaries while competitive allocation of the same resources post 2014 have put an end to such rent extraction. A shift to market-based allocation of resources takes these avenues away, encourages productive economic activity and generates more wealth. Similarly, crony lending that led to wilful default, wherein promoters collectively siphoned off wealth from banks, led to losses that dwarf subsidies directed towards rural development. Every rupee lent to wilful defaulter constitutes an erosion of wealth. As of 2018, wilful defaulters owed their respective lenders nearly Rs.1.4 lakh crores. Had the money siphoned away by wilful defaulters stayed in the economy, the resulting wealth would have been equivalent in value to that needed to double the allocation towards health, education and social protection, double the allocation towards rural development, or triple the allocation towards MGNREGA.


The Survey said that wilful default, if unchecked, would increase the cost of borrowing for everyone else, including genuine businesses with profitable investment opportunities before them. Adverse selection may force genuine borrowers to exist the market altogether, leaving only cronies in the market and resulting in a market failure that slows economic growth, employment and wealth creation capacity.

                The Union Minister for Finance &Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today. The FM informed that India has jumped up 79 positions in World Bank’s Doing Business rankings, improving from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2019. It has progressed on seven out of the 10 parameters. The Goods and Service Tax (GST) and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) top the list of reforms that have propelled India’s rise in rankings. However, it continues to trail in parameters such as Ease of Starting Business (rank 136), Registering Property (rank 154), Paying Taxes (rank 115), and Enforcing Contracts (rank 163).

 

The number of procedures required to set up a business in India, for example, has reduced from 13 to 10 over the past ten years. Today, it takes an average of 18 days to set up a business in India, down from 30 days in 2009. Although, India has significantly reduced the time and cost of starting a business, a lot more needs to be done.

The services sector too faces many regulatory hurdles even for routine businesses. The bars and restaurants sector is an important source of employment and growth everywhere in the world. It is also a business that, by its nature, faces a high frequency of starting new businesses and shutting old ones. A survey showed that the number of licenses required to open a restaurant in India are significantly more than elsewhere.

Construction permits

India has considerably improved the process to obtain construction permits over the last five years. Compared to 2014, when it took approximately 186 days and 28.2 per cent of the warehouse cost; in 2019 it takes 98-113.5 days and 2.8-5.4 per cent of the warehouse cost.

Trading across borders

While the government has already reduced procedural and documentation requirements considerably, increasing digitalization and seamlessly integrating multiple agencies onto a single digital platform can further reduce these procedural inefficiencies significantly and improve user experience substantially.

 

The turnaround time of ships in India has been on a continuous decline, almost halving from 4.67 days in 2010-11 to 2.48 days in 2018-19. This shows that achieving significant efficiency gains in the case of sea ports is possible. The simplification of the Ease of Doing Business landscape of individual sectors such as tourism or manufacturing, however, requires a more targeted approach that maps out the regulatory and process bottlenecks for each segment. Once the process map has been done, the correction can be done at the appropriate level of government - central, state or municipal.

Setting up and operating services or manufacturing business in India faces a maze of laws, rules and regulations. Many of these are local requirements, such as burdensome documentation for police clearance to open a restaurant. This must be cleaned up and rationalized one segment at a time.Enforcing a contract in India takes on average 1,445 days in India compared to just 216 days in New Zealand, and 496 days in China. Paying taxes takes up more than 250 hours in India compared to 140 hours in New Zealand, 138 in China and 191 in Indonesia. These parameters provide a measure of the scope for improvement.

A case study of electronics exports and imports through Bengaluru airport illustrates how Indian logistical processes can be world class.Case studies of merchandise exports found that logistics is inordinately inefficient in Indian sea-ports. The process flow for imports, ironically, is more efficient than that for exports. Although one needs to be careful to directly generalize from specific case studies, it is clear that customs clearance, ground handling and loading in sea ports take days for what can be done in hours.

The Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman presented/tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today.The Surveys says that growth in exports provides a much-needed pathway for job creation in India. For instance, the Survey says, in just the five year period 2001-2006, labour-intensive exports enabled China to create 70 million jobs for workers with primary education. In India, increased exports explain the conversion of about 8,00,000 jobs from informal to formal between 1999 and 2011, representing 0.8 per cent of the labour force, the Pre-Budget Survey says.

The Survey suggests that India must focus on a group of industries, referred to as “network products”, where production processes are globally fragmented andcontrolled by leading Multi-National Enterprises (MNEs) within their “producer driven” global production networks. The Survey notes that China’s remarkable export performance vis-a-vis India is driven primarily by deliberate specialization at large scale in labour–intensive activities, especially “network product”where production occurs across Global Value Chains (GVCs) operated by multi-national corporations.

The Economic Survey advised that by integrating “Assemble in India for the world” into Make in India, India can raise its export market share to about 3.5 per cent by 2025 and 6 per cent by 2030, which is highly feasible. In the process, India would create about 4 crore well-paid jobs by 2025 and about 8 crore by 2030, says the Economic Survey.The Pre-Budget Survey says that the incremental value added in the economy from the target level of exports of network products, which is expected to equal $248 billion in 2025, would make up about one-quarter of the increase required for making India a $5 trillion economy by 2025.

The Survey finds that China-India gap in world market share is almost fully drivenby the effect of specialization. On the other hand, the Survey says, India is clearly catching up with China in terms of diversification across productsand markets, the Survey notes. Overall, high diversification combined with low specialization implies that India is spreading its exports thinly over many products and partners, leading to its lacklustre performance compared to China, the Survey says. According to the Survey, the specialization effect can change over the years, due to changes in the quantity and/or the prices of exported commodities. The Survey suggests, if India wants to become a major exporter, it should specialize more in the areas of its comparative advantage and achieve significant quantity expansion.

The Pre-Budget Survey notes that India’s participation in GVCs has been low compared to the major exporting nations, in East and Southeast Asia.In contrast, China’s export composition shows a strong bias towards traditional labour-intensive industries and labour-intensive stage of production processes within capital-intensive industries (in particular, assembly of electronics and electrical machinery). The Survey further notes that the dominance of capital intensive products in the export basket along with a low level of participation in GVCs have resulted in a disproportionate shift in India’s geographical direction of exports from traditional rich country markets to other destinations.

The Survey observes that driven by the nature of its specialization, India has gained a competitive advantage in relatively low and middle income country markets, but at the cost of losing the much bigger markets in richer countries. According to Survey, though India can benefit significantly from utilizing the potential opportunities from greater trade with high income markets, this requires a reorientation of our trade specialization towards labour-intensive product lines. This can be achieved both via selective focus on (i) traditional labour-intensive sectors and (ii) increased participation in GVCs.

The Survey suggests that given India’s comparative advantage in labour-intensive activities and the imperative of creating employment for a growing labour force, there are two groups of industries that hold the greatest potential for export growth and job creation.First, there exists a significant unexploited export potential in India’s traditional unskilled labour-intensive industries such as textiles, clothing footwear and toys. Second, India has huge potential to emerge as a major hub for final assembly in a range of products, referred to as ‘network products’, says the Economic Survey. The Survey says that the policy of focusing on NP can create significant gains both in employment creation and GDP growth.

According to the Survey, the overall impact on India’s exports to the partners, with which the agreements have been signed, is 13.4% for manufactured products and 10.9 % for total merchandise. The overall impact on imports is found to be lower at 12.7 % for manufactured products and 8.6 % for total merchandise. Therefore, the Survey says, from the perspective of trade balance, India has clearly “gained” in terms of 0.7 % increase in trade surplus per year for manufactured products and of 2.3 % increase in trade surplus per year for total merchandise.

                The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today. The Economic Survey gave a detailed analysis of the ways in which India will achieve the goal of becoming a USD five trillion economy.

Industrial sector performance in terms of its contribution in Gross Value Added (GVA) improved in 2018-19 over 2017-18. However, as per the estimates of Gross Domestic Product by National Statistical Office (NSO), the real GVA of industrial sector grew by 1.6 per cent in first half (H1) (April-September) of 2019-20, as compared to 8.2 per cent in H1 of 2018-19. The low growth in industrial sector is primarily due to manufacturing sector which registered a negative growth of 0.2 per cent in 2019-20 H1.

Index of Industrial Production (IIP)

Overall, IIP growth has moderated to 3.8 per cent in 2018-19 compared to 4.4 per cent in 2017-18. During the current year 2019-20 (April-November), it grew at 0.6 per cent as compared to 5 percent in the corresponding period of previous year. The moderation in growth is mainly arising from subdued manufacturing activities due to slower credit flow to Medium and Small industries, reduced lending by NBFCs owing to liquidity crunch, tapering of domestic demand for key sectors such as automotive sector, pharmaceuticals, and machinery and equipment, volatility in international crude oil prices, prevailing trade related uncertainties. Exports of key labour intensive sectors, such as gems and jewellery, basic metals, leather products and textile products under performed during the current financial year. The growth of capital goods and consumer durables declined by 11.6 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively during the current financial year 2019-20 (April-November). Consumer durables segment was hit mainly due to lack of demand from the household sector especially in Automobile industry.

The growth of infrastructure/construction goods declined by 2.7 per cent in the current financial year 2019-20 (April-November). Intermediate goods and consumer non-durable registered positive growth in November 2019, however, primary goods, capital goods, infrastructure/construction goods and consumer durables reported negative growth in November 2019.

Gross Capital Formation in Industrial Sector

Gross Capital Formation (GCF) in industry has registered a rise from (-) 0.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 7.6 per cent in 2017-18 showing upward momentum of investment in industry. Mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services and construction had registered a growth rate of 7.1 per cent, 8.0 per cent, 6.1 per cent and 8.4 per cent respectively in 2017-18.

Credit Flow to the Industrial Sector

Growth in gross bank credit flow to the industrial sector, on a year on year basis, rose to 2.7 per cent in September 2019 as compared to 2.3 per cent in September 2018. Credit flow industries like wood and wood products, all engineering, cement and cement products, construction and infrastructure increased in September 2019 as compared to September 2018. Credit flow to industries like food processing, chemicals and chemical products, vehicles, vehicles parts and transport equipment registered lower growth in September 2019 as compared to September 2018.

Corporate Sector Performance

The manufacturing sector contracted in Q1 of 2019-20 mainly due to a production slowdown. Petroleum products, iron and steel, motor vehicles and other transport equipment companies were the major contributors to the slowdown.

Net profit of corporate sector recovered in Q2 of 2019-20 and was 17.4 per cent. Sales growth of over 1,700 listed private manufacturing companies contracted by 7.7 per cent in Q2 of 2019-20 after remaining in expansionary zone since Q2 of 2016-17. The capacity utilization of India’s manufacturing sector remains stable at 73.6 per cent in Q1 of 2019-20 as compared to 73.8 per cent in Q1 of 2018-19.

Performance of CPSEs

Of the 348 Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) on 31-03-2019, 249 are in operation, 86 CPSEs are yet to start commercial operations and 13 CPSEs are under closure/liquidation. Out of 249 operating CPSEs, 178 CPSE showed profit during 2018-19, 70 CPSEs incurred losses during the year and one CPSE has shown neither profit nor loss.

The total profit of the 178 profit making CPSEs was Rs.1.75 lakh crores in 2018-19. The total loss of the 70 loss making enterprises stood at Rs.31,635 crores during the year.

The contribution of the CPSEs to the Central Exchequer increased by 4.67 per cent to Rs.3.69 lakh crores in 2018-19 as against previous year of Rs.3.52 lakh crores.

Eight Core Industries

Growth of Eight Core industries (Coal, Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Refinery Products, Fertilizers, Steel, Cement and Electricity) stood flat during the current financial year (April-November, 2019). During the corresponding period of the previous year, these industries grew at 5.1 per cent. While fertilizers, steel and electricity have seen expansion in their production, production of coal, crude oil, natural gas and refinery products have contracted during the current financial year. 

 

 

 

Sector wise issues and Initiatives

Steel


	stood at second position in the production of crude steel. It is also the third largest consumer of the finished steel after China and USA. Till October 2019, crude steel production was 64.3 MT, showing a growth of 1.5 per cent over corresponding period of last year with utilization capacity of 77.4 per cent. Production of finished steel was 137.2 MT in 2018-19 and 59.73 MT during April to October 2019.


Coal

Overall production of raw coal in India during 2018-19 was 730.4 MT displaying a growth of 8.1 per cent.

Textile and Apparels


	contributed 18.0 per cent of manufacturing and 2.0 per cent of GDP in 2017-18. The share of textiles and clothing in India’s total export was 12 per cent in 2018-19. It employs 4.5 crore people directly and 6 crore people in allied sector. Exports of textile and clothing products including handicraft from India have increased to USD 40.4 billion in 2018-19 from USD 39.2 billion in 2017-18.


In a fast moving world India has to develop its industry and enlarge the scope for Industry 4.0. that will encompass automation in industrial sectors. The Economic Survey 2019-20 shows the way that will clear the decks which are obstructing the way forward.

                Commerce & Industry and Railways Minister, Piyush Goyal participated in an Informal Ministerial Gathering in Davos last week. During his intervention at the Gathering Commerce and Industry Minister said that the current challenges throw up some key priorities for MC12 (The Twelfth Ministerial Conference will take place from 8-11 June 2020 in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan), including WTO reform. He said that on the Appellate Body, India believes, that all must work collectively to achieve the vision of the founding fathers, for an effective multilateral trading system. The early restoration of the full strength of the Appellate Body, will contribute to the realization of that objective added Piyush Goyal.

Further, the agenda for WTO reforms should be balanced and inclusive, to address the historic asymmetries in the Uruguay Round Agreements stated Commerce and Industry Minister.  A good starting point for the reform agenda, would be removing the imbalances in the Agreement on Agriculture, and ensuring a level playing field, particularly for developing economies added Piyush Goyal. He further said that as long-standing proponents of WTO reform, developing countries have,for almost 20 years,sought the elimination of unequal and trade-distorting entitlements in the Agreement on Agriculture. Another positive step will be, to build upon the work of the last several years, and to implement existing mandates such as a permanent solution for public stock holding for food security purposes suggested Commerce and Industry Minister. He further said that this will help in enhancing the trust of developing countries, in the WTO’s negotiating arm.

Commerce and Industry Minister also said that Developing countries, particularly the LDCs, have not been able to achieve an equitable share in world trade, therefore, the continued availability of special and differential treatment, for these countries, is imperative for them to address their development aspirations. The reform process should not be used, to further restrict the flexibilities, and policy space required by developing countries, to better integrate with the global trading system added Piyush Goyal. He further said that it should open more opportunities for them, taking into account the contrasting levels of prosperity, unequal levels of economic development, and vast disparity in human development indicators, so that global trade becomes sustainable. 

Commerce and Industry Minister underlined that a significant outcome at MC12 is essential, for further strengthening the role of the WTO in global trade. He stated that he is confident that in the run-up to MC12, India’s Missions in Geneva will do the necessary spadework,to help Ministers arrive at a consensus, and reach a meaningful outcome at Nur-Sultan. To achieve this, he added that, it is necessary to put in place a structured processthat will help finalize a limited list of focussed, do-able and fair proposals, that may be concluded at MC12.

Commerce and Industry Minister also addressed India’s concerns about fisheries subsidies to be adopted at MC12. Unregulated industrial fishing by some nations, has led to a major depletion of the global marine stock said Piyush Goyal and there is an urgent need for strong disciplines to regulate harmful fisheries subsidies in order to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources for securing inter-generational equity. At the same time, Minister cautioned that, countries need to be cognizant of the existence of a large population of subsistence and artisanal fishermen in LDCs and developing countries who rely on fishing for their basic livelihood. He urged that as they have no other livelihood options, all nations must collectively care for this vulnerable population of marginalised fishermen. This is precisely why both SDG 14.6 and the MC11 decision on fisheries, clearly mandate that there should be appropriate and effective Special &Differential treatment for developing countries added Piyush Goyal. This could be the basis for a forward looking outcome on fisheries subsidies he added. Adequate policy space, to ensure a decent standard of living for subsistence-level fishermen, by modernizing their fishing fleet and expanding their fishing capacity, is a critical outcome for India said the Minister.

Commerce and Industry Minister in his intervention also said that as an overall objective, the WTO must ensure transparency and fair practices in global trade, to ensure that our mutual economic engagement results in growth and prosperity for all.         

Inconclusion Commerce and Industry Minister reiterated and re-assuredall members that India remains a staunch supporter of the rules-based, multilateral, trading system, and will actively engage with members, to address the challenges before the WTO.

Commerce and Industry Minister thanked the Swiss Government for hosting the informal Ministerial at Davos and for their hospitality.He also thanked DG WTO for his assessment of the state of play and prospects for MC12.

                The visit of the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, is a sign of the growing importance of the India – Brazil bilateral partnership said Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways, Piyush Goyal, during his address at the inaugural session of the India-Brazil Business Forum held in New Delhi today.

He hoped that as Brazil is one of the most important trading partners of India in the entire LAC (Latin America and Caribbean) region trade between the two countries will grow to USD 15 billion by 2022. 

The 15 MoUs signed during the visit of the President of Brazil shows the power of democracy, demography, leadership, the talent pool available in India, India’s market and the aspirations of one billion Indian citizens for a better life said the Commerce and Industry Minister. The MoUs of cooperation that have been signed during the presidential visit on investments, trade facilitation, social security, agriculture, defence and double taxation makes this the most productive visit by a Brazilian Head of State. 

Commerce and Industry Minister hoped that investments will also grow in the sectors of clean energy, startups, railways and creation of value chains between India and Brazil where goods may be semi assembled in one country and finished in another. Piyush Goyal informed that the entire Indian Railway will be fully electrified by 2024 and by 2030 the railway network in India will run completely on clean energy with zero emission.

Commerce and Industry Minister welcomed the announcement made during the visit of President of Brazil to India for visa free travel between the two countries. He added that visitors for business and tourism between two countries will benefit greatly from this.

Commerce and Industry Minister also urged that the India – Brazil Business Leader’s Forum may be activated and reconstituted to make it more relevant and contemporary to businesses in both countries. 

Commerce and Industry Minister hoped that India’s services in wellness sector like Yoga and Ayurveda will further grow as Brazil has a strong community of Yoga and Ayurveda practitioners. Brazil has an association of Ayurveda (ABRA), a nonprofit association with offices in 9 states of Brazil and members all over Brazil and the third International Congress on Ayurveda was held from 12 to 15 March 2018 in Rio de Janeiro. The conference saw participation of more than 4000 delegates, including many from India. 

India and Brazil share close relationship at the bilateral level as well as plurilateral fora like BRICS, BASIC, G-20, IBSA, International Solar Alliance and in larger multilateral bodies like UN, UNESCO and WIPO stated Commerce and Industry Minister. He further said that the decade long bilateral strategic partnership is based on a common global vision shared democratic values and a commitment to foster economic growth with social inclusion for the welfare of the people of both countries.

                Government eMarketplace (GeM), under the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce & Industry and Government of Uttar Pradesh, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to set up a GeM Organizational Transformation Team (GOTT) Project Management Unit (PMU) in the State. 

The MoU aims to expedite the harmonization of the procurement guidelines of the two entities and integration of systems, enabling seamless procuring experience. The PMU to be setup under the MoU will make it easier for MSMEs of U.P. to onboard and transact on GeM. Ministry of Finance, Government of India, has advised Ministries and Departments of Central and State Governments to consider services of GOTT on an outcome based self-sustenance model. GOTT will assist the buyer agency to redesign the procurement processes and enhance competencies to derive maximum benefit from the online marketplace.

The MoU was signed by CEO, GeM, Talleen Kumar and Principal Secretary, Department of MSME and Export Promotion, Navneet Sehgal on 25th January 2020. Cabinet Minister, Siddarth Nath Singh and Minister of State, Government of Uttar Pradesh, UdayBhan Singh were also present on this occasion.

The Government of Uttar Pradesh is the second State after Punjab to establish a GOTT-PMU for effectively utilizing this transformational initiative towards inclusive, efficient and transparent procurement. Among the CPSEs, SAIL has already signed MoU for setting up a PMU. Many other states and CPSEs are in the process of setting up GOTT-PMUs.

                Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry will showcase a tableau on Startup India in this year’s Republic Day Parade at Rajpath in New Delhi. The tableau on the theme Startups: Reach for the Sky will showcase stages of the lifecycle of a startup and the all-round support provided by the Government in this journey. The tableau will depict how ideas come to life and how the innovations that emerge positively affect lives of the citizens of India. 

The front of the tableau depicts a creative mind, full of ideas to solve real world problems. The Startup India Tree, in the middle, represents the different kinds of support given to startups. The staircase denotes the stages of growth – proving a concept, creating a prototype, preparing a business plan, building a team, launching into markets and eventually scaling up. The wheel at the rear depicts sectors of economy where Indian entities have driven economic growth and created employment opportunities on a large scale. The map of India represents the spread of the startup movement, steadily reaching the semi-urban and rural areas. The wheel and the map together depict the width and the depth of the Startup India movement in the country.

Startup India is a flagship initiative of the Government of India, intended to build a strong ecosystem to nurture innovation, drive sustainable economic growth and generate large scale employment opportunities. The objective of Startup India is to inspire and motivate the youth of India to follow their dreams to generate wealth and become job creators and not just job seekers.

The Startup India Action Plan, launched on 16th of January 2016, has stirred entrepreneurial spirit across the country. Under the Startup India Scheme, eligible companies can get recognized as startups by DPIIT in order to access a host of tax benefits, easier compliance, IPR fast tracking and other benefits. More than 26,000 startups from 551 districts of 28 States and 7 Union Territories have been recognized in this period. Working across IT, Industry 4.0, education, healthcare, agriculture, energy, finance, space, defence and all other sectors of economy, Indian startups have attracted substantial global investments and created more than 2,91,000 jobs.

                The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry has launched paperless licensing process through Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) for petroleum service stations (retail outlets storing and dispensing petrol/diesel for motor conveyances) under the Petroleum Rules, 2002.

Paperless application and grant of license process for road tankers for transportation of petroleum under the Petroleum Rules has been launched on 7th January, 2020. After the launch of paperless process, more than 300 licences have been issued.
Taken together, licences for petroleum service stations and road tankers for transportation of petroleum account for more than 85% of total licences under the Petroleum Rules, 2002.

This initiative for petroleum pump licensing is directly going to benefit more than 70,000 petroleum pump owners and oil marketing companies under the Petroleum Rules, 2002. An added advantage of this move is that the authenticity of the license may be verified on PESO’s website https://peso.gov.in/index.aspx. This automation will greatly benefit the petroleum and gas industry.

This initiative is in line with the vision of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s Digital India and Ease of Doing Business towards paperless and green India that will provide simpler mechanism, ease of living and business to the petroleum road tanker owners. The process will include filing the applications online, online payment of fees which will go directly to the concerned officer’s ID without any manual interface. Applicants, at each stage of processing of the application, will be intimated via SMS and email, in case of discrepancy or grant of license or approval. These details will also be reflected in the applicant’s profile. The entire process will not require any printing and physical dispatch of license. The license will be dispatched electronically.

                Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) has added 135 laboratories to existing 51 recognized laboratories.  With this initiative APEDA recognition of laboratories has reached 186 laboratories across the country. The number of laboratories have increased in states with exporting potential like Maharashtra (35), Gujarat (23), Andhra Pradesh & Telangana (10), Tamil Nadu (23) and Karnataka (17). Laboratory testing requirements are crucial in agri export supply chain.

For increasing the laboratory network further, APEDA has taken a policy decision for simplification of APEDA recognition of laboratories.  It has been decided that the laboratories which are NABL accredited will be recognized by APEDA and same will be added in the network of APEDA recognition laboratories.  This will enable APEDA to continuously expand its recognition network of laboratories across the country and will enable the exporters to have an easy access to the laboratories for testing of APEDA scheduled products for exports.

Average time taken to initiate an Anti-Dumping investigation has also come down to 33 days in 2019-20 as compared to 43 days in 2018-19.

 DGTR has also started using all available options for providing relief against unfair trade practices like the first ever Safeguard Quantitative Restrictions investigation on imports of Iso-propyl Alcohol initiated under the FTDR Act, 2002 on 04.11.2019; three Bilateral Safeguard Investigations initiated (Refined Bleached Deodrized Palmolien against Malaysia; Phthalic Anhydride and Polybutadiene Rubber against Korea); two global Safeguard investigations initiated under the Custom Tariff Act, 1997 (Phenol and Single Mode Optical Fibre) and nine Countervailing Duty investigations completed and five are underway.

Anti-circumvention provision was introduced in Customs Tariff Act, 1975 for Counter-vailing Duty (CVD) investigations. Rules of circumvention for AD and CVD are being simplified for providing relief to the domestic industry so that increased instances of circumvention in AD/CVD can be addressed. Six cases of anti-circumvention have been completed so far.

DGTR has initiated outreach programmes to sensitize stakeholders about the available trade remedy measures. The outreach programmes were conducted by officers of DGTR in Gurugram on 25.06.2019, Mumbai from 26.09.2019 to 27.09.2019 and Ahmedabad on 13.12.2019.

Training programmes were held during August-September, 2019 to sensitize the officers of Indian Trade Service, Indian Cost Accounts Service and officers from select Administrative Ministries regarding the available trade remedial measures.

Commerce and Industry Minister held a stakeholder meeting on Regulatory Instruments for formulation and implementation of an effective Trade Policy and Development Strategy on 11.09.2019. A help desk and Facilitation Centre were established on 23.09.2019 to facilitate optimal utilization by different stakeholders of available trade remedial measures aimed at curbing unfair trade. A total of 62 different issues have been dealt by the Centre since its setting up in September, 2019. 

DGTR has launched an online portal - ARTIS (Application for Remedies in Trade for Indian industry and other Stakeholders) on 30.09.2019 to enhance transparency, efficiency and provide expedited relief to the domestic producers for different trade remedies like anti-dumping duty, safeguard duty and countervailing duty. Applicants can also monitor the current status of their applications through this portal. The portal will be further improvised so that it can in real terms bring about transformative change in the process of filing, tracking and monitoring the Trade Remedy applications.

                GeM Samvaad, a two month long national outreach programme was launched on 17th December 2019 to reach out to stakeholders across the country and also local sellers in order to facilitate on-boarding of local sellers on the marketplace while catering to specific requirements and procurement needs of buyers. 

The outreach programme took off from 19th December 2019 and during the launch week the States of Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh were covered. 

GeM Samvaad is being conducted in all States and Union Territories. After the first four states the outreach programme has been held in J & K on 5th January, Ladakh on 7th January, Assam and Bihar on 9th January and in Chandigarh on 8th January 2020. All the outreach programmes witnessed overwhelming participation of buyers and sellers. GeM senior officers are steering the programmes. They are also interacting with buyers and sellers attending the events. Arrangements for the outreach programmes including logistics are made by the respective State Governments. The target is to reach out to all stakeholders and learn from their experiences on their usage of GeM portal. Through this outreach programme, GeM expects to make the actual users aware about the new features and functionalities of the portal and collect feedback, which is the first step towards GeM’s ‘Voice of Customer’ initiative. 

A Roundtable with Ministries/Departments & Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) was held on 14 January 2020 in New Delhi as part of GeM Samvaad. It was chaired by Secretary, Department of Commerce, Government of India and CEO GeM. 

 

More than 100 participants including Financial Advisors & nodal officers of Ministries, Departments, and representatives of CPSEs participated in the Roundtable and shared their feedback, challenges and suggestions. 

Commerce Secretary highlighted the need for full utilization of the potential of GeM. He stated that Rule 149 of GFR and directives of the Department of Public Enterprises make the procurement of goods and services by Ministries and CPSEs mandatory for goods and services available on GeM and the same should not be violated.

GeM is continuously working to bring all the items on-board and buyers should accelerate this process by providing specifications of categories and asking sellers to onboard GeM. He further emphasized the importance of timely payments to sellers and stated that buyers should ensure payments to sellers on time. 

State Departments and Organizations and Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) have been using GeM for their buying needs. Sellers from the States are also benefitting through the access to national Public Procurement market using the portal. Through GeM Samvaad the marketplace is looking forward to receiving feedback from users which will be used for making improvements and advancements in the system.

GeM has more than 15 lakh products and around 20,000 services, more than 3 lakh registered sellers and service providers and more than 40,000 Government buyer organizations. In its short journey of three years, GeM has processed more than 28 lakh orders worth Rs. 40,000 crores in Gross Merchandise Value out of which 50% has been transacted by MSMEs.

                India strongly believes in multilateralism and will work for the strengthening of the WTO with other stakeholders said Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways,Piyush Goyal, in New Delhi today. He was part of a panel discussion at the Raisina Dialogue being held in the National Capital on 14-16 January 2020.

India has been at the receiving end of unfair trade practices for a very long time and therefore believes in the creation of a far more reformed rules based trading system said the Minister.

He further stated that India also believes in the strengthening of the WTO and is one of the first four countries to pay all its dues to the World Trade Body. 

Commerce and Industry Minister stated that it is the right time now to make trade policies that are people centric to be sustainable, to eliminate poverty and raise prosperity levels for all citizens.

Piyush Goyal informed that India has not imposed any curbs on imports from either Malaysia or Turkey or any other country and it believes in fair play and equal terms for all trading partners and if curbs are imposed,they apply to all countries.

On the issue of the import of goods in the ‘others’ category, the Commerce and Industry Minister clarified that one out of four items valued at USD 130 billion are in the ‘others’ category. Right classification of these imports under HSN code will only lead to greater transparency and establish fair trading practices and make India a fair place to do business and trade and also provide equal opportunity to all.

Commerce and Industry Minister also clarified that India allows e-commerce companies to work on the marketplace model where buyers and sellers are free to buy and sell and follow the rules of the marketplace and laws of the country which clearly say that FDI in multi-brand retail willonly be allowed up to 49%. Surreptitious entry by e-commerce companies into multi-brand retail, that is being investigated by the authorities is welcome said the Minister.

Commerce and Industry Minister informed that India is in dialogue with EU and the US to sort out pressing trade issues and further expand engagement with them.

                No imports will be allowed without HSN code into the country said the Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Railways, Piyush Goyal in New Delhi today. He was speaking at the 6th National Standards Conclave on the subject of Standards for Trade Facilitation.

Commerce & Industry Minister further said that henceforth there must be zero tolerance for substandard products and services from industry and consumers. He further stated that Government will support industry in every way to establish standards for Indian goods and services to meet international requirements so that brand India is recognized in the world as a provider of quality products and services. Unless Indian business and industry make standards its calling card, India will not be able to reach the target of a USD 5 trillion economy, said Piyush Goyal. The Government is committed to establishing standards of Indian products and services to world class levels which will enable our exports to be accepted globally due to the quality of goods and services, added the Minister. He said Made in India should carry the commitment of 130 crore people towards quality, sincerity, customer satisfaction and not be second best.

Commerce and Industry Minister further said that it is an unfortunate reality for India that the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) entered into with other countries has not led to the growth of India’s trade and business because the poor quality of the products and services that get restricted with non-tariff barriers when exported. He further elaborated on this point with the number of Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) in countries like US (8000), Brazil (3879), China (2872) and India with only 439 TBTs. This illustrates the fact as to the manner in which India and rest of the world are looking at the concept of quality in products and services, said the Minister.

Commerce and Industry Minister further stated that the time has come to get out of the mind set of subsiding exports and adopt the mantra of zero defect zero effect in order to ensure that emerging India will be the destination for quality products and services. He said that the need of the hour is to get cracking towards a zero defect policy, that Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has articulated a number of times. The Minister said that the quality standards must be accepted as the reality of an emerging India, an India that wishes to be recognised as a country manufacturing quality products.

Commerce and Industry Minister informed that the new Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Act is relooking at all standards for goods and services in order to balance the interest of consumers with that of the industry which will enable the culture of quality to take root in the country and production or import of substandard products and services will not be tolerated any longer.

Commerce and Industry Minister urged BIS, FSSAI and other departments of the Government, that are mandated to set up and establish standards, to work in mission mode so that goods and services produced and imported in India meet international quality requirements. This will help India to engage with the world on equal and reciprocal terms.

Commerce and Industry Minister hoped that this will see a new era of quality production of goods and services in the country and quality will be the buzzword and the collaborative approach of Government, industry and consumer will help in setting up and upgrading standards to give the best products and services to the consumers and also ensure the protection of the environment. 

The 6th National Standards Conclave is being held in Delhi on 15-16 January 2020 and is organized by Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Export Inspection Council of India (EIC), National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB) and the Centre for Research on International Trade.

                In line with the vision of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s Digital India and Ease of Doing Business, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, has launched paperless licensing process through Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) for road tankers for transportation of petroleum under the Petroleum Rules, 2002.  

This is a significant move towards paperless and green India that will provide simpler mechanism, ease of living and business to the petroleum road tanker owners. Moving towards digitisation, the process will include filing the applications online. This will also include online payment of fees which will go directly to the concerned officer’s ID without any manual interface. Applicants, at each stage of processing of the application, will be intimated via SMS and email, whether discrepancy or grant of licence or approval. This will be in addition to the same being reflected in the applicant’s profile.

The new process will update the applicant at each stage triggering an e-mail and SMS immediately when the licence is granted by the officer concerned and is dispatched electronically. All this process will be without any need for printing and physical dispatch.

This extraordinary and forward looking initiative is directly going to benefit more than one lakh petroleum road tanker owners who together hold more than half of total licences issued under the Petroleum Rules, 2002. An added advantage of this move is that the authenticity of the licence can be verified through public domain available on PESO’s website. This automation is going to revolutionise the petroleum & gas industry benefitting it immensely.

                Commerce and Industry & Railways Minister Piyush Goyal chaired a meeting yesterday in New Delhi to review the remaining recommendations of the Baba Kalyani report on Special Economic Zone (SEZ) policy of India. The meeting was attended by members of the Baba Kalyani group along with representatives from the Department of Revenue, Department of Legal Affairs and legal firms. 

Commerce and Industry Minister examined the revamp of the SEZ policy with a view to meeting the global challenges being faced by Indian exporters. Discussions were also held to find a way out for implementation of the remaining recommendations in order to facilitate the ease of doing business in the present global market scenario.

The recommendations which have been completed include review of specific exclusions proposed in NFE computation in light of Make in India initiative, sharing of duty exempted assets/ infrastructure between units to be allowed against specific approval, and formalization of de-notification process for enclaves and delinking its present mandatory usage for SEZs purpose only. The other implemented recommendations are support to servicification of manufacturing zone, allowing manufacturing enabling services companies, broad-banding definition of services/allowing multiple services to come together and flexibility to enter into a long term lease agreement with stakeholders in Zones in line with the State policies and the application for constructing minimum built up area by Developer or Co-developer beyond a period of ten years from the date of notification of the SEZ on merits of each case..

Other changes and initiatives taken for the SEZs include delegation of powers to Development Commissioner for shifting of SEZ unit from one zone to another, supplies of services in DTA against foreign exchange or Indian Rupees to be counted towards NFE, enable a trust to be considered for grant of permission to set-up a unit in a SEZ, setting up of cafeteria, gymnasium, creche and other similar facilities/ amenities and uniform list of services to SEZ.

The Baba Kalyani led committee was constituted by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to study the existing SEZ policy of India and had submitted its recommendations in November 2018. The objectives of the committee were to evaluate the SEZ policy and make it WTO compatible, suggest measures for maximizing utilization of vacant land in SEZs, suggest changes in the SEZ policy based on international experience and merge the SEZ policy with other Government schemes like coastal economic zones, Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, national industrial manufacturing zones and food and textile parks.

If India is on the path to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025 then the present environment of manufacturing competitiveness and services have to undergo a basic paradigm shift. The success seen in services sector like IT and ITeS have to be promoted in other services sectors like health care, financial services, legal, repair and design services.

The Government of India has set a target of creating 100 million jobs and achieving 25% of GDP from the manufacturing sector by 2022, as part of the flagship Make in India programme. Further, the Government plans to increase manufacturing value to USD 1.2 trillion by 2025. While these plans are intended to propel India into a growth trajectory, it requires evaluation of existing policy frameworks to catalyse manufacturing sector growth. At the same time, policy needs to be compliant with the relevant WTO regulations.

                The Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector has better adaptability to cater to the export market due to its smaller size and can adapt to market change sooner said Union Minister of Commerce and Industry & Railways, Piyush Goyal, during a meeting held in New Delhi yesterday to discuss with MSME associations various industry issues and examine the steps that may be taken to resolve them.

Many issues pertaining to the MSME sector were put up for discussion with the Commerce and Industry Minister by MSMEs through the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), SME Chamber of India and PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  The most important issues that were discussed in the meeting included the problem faced by SME units in accessing credit from banks, delay in payments from Public Sector Units and Government departments, the issue of GST refund, the dearth of skilled manpower in the SME sector and the issue of differing wages in States across the country.

The MSME sector in India employs over 100 million people and accounts for 45% of manufacturing output and more than 40% of the country’s exports. With 63.4 million units throughout the country, MSMEs contribute around 6.11% of the manufacturing GDP and 24.63% of the GDP from service activities. 

Commerce and Industry Minister directed Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and the Credit Guarantee Funds Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) to set up a framework that will enable them to process loans to SME units faster and also provide insurance cover to the SME exporters.

Commerce and Industry Minister urged the SME sector manufacturers to produce high quality goods following international standards so that exports from the SME sector may become a part of the global value chain. 

On the issue of delayed payments, Commerce and Industry Minister examined the possibility of big companies making full payment to SMEs against delivery so that working capital of SME units are not blocked. 

In order to mainstream the 8 million Indian women who have started and are running their own businesses Minister directed that the Government e-Marketplace may handhold the women led SMEs and onboard these enterprises on the GeM portal.

Commerce and Industry Minister assured the SME sector that the Government will give all support and help in the skilling of manpower required for the sector and in all other areas that requires intervention of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

                Commerce and Industry & Railways Minister Piyush Goyal today inaugurated the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Knowledge Hub in New Delhi, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered learning ecosystem that will assist the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector. Speaking on this occasion Commerce & Industry Minister said that although India has developed as the second largest fintech hub in the world, a lot of work still needs to be done in the BFSI sector. He hoped that the Knowledge Hub created by NSE will fill in these gaps and help the financial sector to move into the future.

                The Agri Export Policy was announced last year with an objective of doubling the export and ensuring doubling of farmers’ income. In order to achieve this objective, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) has been adopting a focused approach for ensuring greater involvement of the State governments for effective implementation of Agri Export Policy (AEP). Throughout the year APEDA held a series of meetings with the State Government officials and other stakeholders for the preparation of State Action Plan which included all essential components like production clusters, capacity building, infrastructure and logistics and R & D and budget requirements for the implementation of AEP. Several rounds of discussions were held with Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, Ministry of Food Processing Industries and other agencies under Line Ministries for seeking the inputs for formulating a strategy to increase exports and address the existing bottlenecks in the trade.

Many States have nominated Nodal agency and Nodal officer. Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Punjab and Karnataka have finalized the State Action Plan and other States are at different stages of finalization of the action plan.

State level Monitoring Committees have been formed in many of the States. Cluster visits have been made by APEDA Nodal officers to the product clusters at Jalandhar (Potato), Jodhpur (Isabgol), Banaskantha (Dairy products), Sangli (Grapes), Solapur (Pomegranate), Nagpur (Orange), Chittoor (Mango), Theni (Banana), Salem (Poultry products), Indore (Onion) and Chikkaballapur (Rose onion). The roadmap for cluster development in the clusters notified under AEP was prepared to address the identified interventions during the cluster visits. As a result of cluster visits by APEDA, the cluster level committee has been constituted in the States viz. Potato in Punjab, Isabgol in Rajasthan, Pomegranate, Orange and Grapes in Maharashtra and Banana in Tamil Nadu.

APEDA has organised a number of seminars and meetings for the implementation of Agri Export Policy throughout the year. A workshop on the role of state nodal agencies in agriculture exports was organised in New Delhi on 3rd September, 2019 where majority of the states actively participated for brainstorming on implementation of AEP in States.

An MoU was signed with National Cooperative Development Corporation to include Co-operatives for their active role in AEP. A Farmer Connect Portal has also been set up by APEDA on its website for providing a platform for Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) to interact with exporters. Over 800 FPOs have been registered on the portal.

 Buyer Seller Meet (BSM) cum Workshops between exporters and FPOs were organized in association with the State Nodal agency at Ujjain (M.P)., Mehboobnagar, Mahbubabad, Sangareddy (Telangana), Kandhamal (Odisha), Chitradurga (Karnataka), Shillong (Meghalaya), Shimla (H.P), Kadapa (Andhra Pradesh), Kolkata (West Bengal), Agartala (Tripura), Nagpur, Sangli (Maharashtra) and Dehradun (Uttarakhand).

A Market Intelligence Cell was set up in APEDA and the activity of dissemination of e-market intelligence reports comprising detailed market analysis, international trade issues, current scenario of the interest to Indian exporters in important markets and statistical information has been started from 25th November 2019. All e-reports are available on APEDA website https://apeda.gov.in. Till now 27 reports have been disseminated for mango, basmati rice, non-basmati rice, groundnut, grapes, gherkins, dehydrated onion, pomegranate, banana, potato, buffalo meat, swine meat, fresh cut flowers, wine, egg, dairy products (SMP & cheese), biscuits, jaggery, millets, vegetable seeds, moringa, makhana, fruit juices, mango pulp, potato flakes and cereal preparations.

The seventh annual meeting of the Indo-German Working Group on Quality Infrastructure took place on 16th and 17th January 2020 in New Delhi with around 80 participants. Germany and India established the Working Group in 2013 to strengthen their economic and technical cooperation, reduce technical barriers to trade, and increase product safety. The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs & Energy (BMWi) and the Indian Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in collaboration with other Ministries are working closely together on standardisation, accreditation and conformity assessment, metrology, product safety and market surveillance.

Director General Stefan Schnorr of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy: “Quality infrastructure is the language of international trade. With a growing relevance of technical regulations – such as mandatory standards – our exchange on regulatory approaches and compliance procedures eases doing business and boosts trade. I welcome the signing of our Work Plan 2020. We have agreed to intensify the cooperation on standards, technical regulation, certification, and market surveillance in key economic areas such as machinery safety, automotive, electric mobility and cybersecurity. A mutual understanding of requirements for safe and secure products helps to protect the citizens in both countries. Our Indo-German discussion paper on the cybersecurity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices which we just launched is a good example for our successful cooperation.”

Secretary, Consumer Affairs, ShriAvinash K. Srivastava said that “Germany is a trusted and important partner for India. It is encouraging to see the intense technical cooperation that happens in our bilateral Working Group. I am happy to see that we have deepened our cooperation in areas such as cybersecurity, market surveillance, Industry 4.0, and legal metrology. This year we will also put a focus on strengthening the dialogue on technical regulation, exchange on regulations of medical devices, and exploring twinning arrangements at ISO and IEC level.”

 



 

This year's annual meeting was attended by a German delegation of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) headed by Director General Stefan Schnorr, representatives from the German Institute for Standardization (DIN), the German Commission for Electrical, Electronic & Information Technologies (DKE), the National Metrology Institute of Germany (PTB), and representatives from German companies and industry associations such as VDMA and VDA. The Indian delegation included representatives from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) as well as the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). 

The dialogues on Quality Infrastructure take place within the framework of the Global Project Quality Infrastructure (GPQI), within which BMWi engages in political and technical dialogues with strategic trading partners. GIZ – the German Agency for International Cooperation – supports the implementation of the project on behalf of BMWi.

The Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution today held a press conference regarding mandatory hallmarking of Gold jewelry & artefacts in India for which notification will be issued by the Department of Consumer Affairs providing a period of one year for implementation i.e. till January, 2021. Addressing the media, Shri Paswan said that the purpose of making hallmarking mandatory for Gold Jewelry and Artefacts is to ensure that consumers are not cheated while buying gold ornaments and get the purity as marked on the ornaments, they are better informed about the purity of Gold which will now be in only 3 caratage i.e. 14, 18 and 22 and corruption is removed. 

Explaining the reasons for the one-year implementation period, Shri Paswan said that this will ensure that Jewelers registration process can be completed and jewelers/retailers get time for clearing their old/existing stock and also so that additional A&H centres can be set up by private entrepreneurs at various locations where demand arises and priority shall be given to districts where such centres are not present. As on 31st December 2019, there are 892 Assaying and Hallmarking centres spread in 234 District locations across the country and so far 28,849 jewelers have been registered by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

BIS (Hallmarking) Regulations, 2018 were notified w.e.f. 14.06.2018. BIS is running a hallmarking scheme for gold jewelry since April 2000. The BIS Act 2016 has enabling provisions under Section 14 & Section 16 for mandatory hallmarking of Gold jewellery & artefacts  by the Central Government. This will make it compulsory for all the jewellers selling  Gold jewellery and artefacts to register with BIS & sell only hallmarked Gold jewellery & artefacts. The draft Quality Control Order (QCO) for mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery and gold artefacts was hosted on WTO website on 10 October 2019 for comments for a period of 60 days. No comments have been received on the draft QCO.

The caratage is marked on jewelry in addition to fineness for convenience of consumers, e.g. for 22 carat jewelry, 22K will be marked in addition to 916, for 18 carat jewelry, 18K will be marked in addition to 750 and for 14 carat jewelry, 14K will be marked in addition to 585. Hallmark on Gold Jeweler now has following four marks:

 

           Purity in carat and                 Assay centre’s               Jewellers identification                  

    BIS Mark         Fineness (e.g.22K916)        identification mark                 mark

 

An awareness campaign on mandatory hallmarking for jewellers and common consumers will be organized at various locations across the country. BIS is also planning to outreach the consumers through social media and other forms.

The Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswanheld a press conference today to brief media about the overall availability and prices of Onions across the nation along with the imported quantities so far. Shri Paswan said that the Union Government has decided to offer Onions to State Governments at the landing price in Mumbai ranging from Rs. 49 to Rs. 58 per Kilogram. The Union Minister said that imports began from mid-December and States were asked to place their firm demand in order to get the supply from the imported stock. States had initially put a demand for 33,139 MT of Onions which was later revised to 14,309 MT due to various reasons including reduction in domestic prices and improved availability. 

The Union Minister stated that 1 Lakh MT of Onions was the target but since the Onion growing season had ended across the world and international prices were high, Orders were placed strategically in small lots and over a period of time to ensure international prices don’t increase drastically. The Union Government had planned the imports based on the initial demand and has already contracted almost 40,000 MT of Onions which will arrive in India before the end of January. So far, 12,000 MT of Onions have arrived in the country and is ready for distribution among the State Government.

Shri Paswan further added that the main concern is to protect the interest of consumers and for ensuring that, the domestic supply is being augmented with imports so that prices are moderated and overall availability is increased. He said that there has to be a coordinated effort between the Central and State Governments and the consumers to ensure this objective is achieved. Therefore, the Union Minister exhorted all State Governments to honour the demands they had placed initially and may even go beyond their initial demand and distribute the imported Onions in their respective States to ensure that prices are moderated.     

The Secretary, Consumer Affairs, Shri Avinash Srivastava informed the media that the Cabinet Secretary held a video conference this morning to persuade State Governments to buy more Onions from the imported stock for direct retailing/distribution in the State to increase overall availability and reduce prices. He said that December onwards, the prices had begun coming down which led the State Governments to also reduce their respective demands. The Cabinet Secretary in the VC with 12 States including Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu asked the States to honour the initial demand and pick up more from the imported stock if needed in order to curb prices.

                The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) notified the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) (Amendment) Regulations, 2020 on 6th January 2020.

The amendment clarifies that a person, who is not eligible under the Code to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor, shall not be a party in any manner to a compromise or arrangement of the corporate debtor under section 230 of the Companies Act, 2013. It also clarifies that a secured creditor cannot sell or transfer an asset, which is subject to security interest, to any person, who is not eligible under the Code to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor.

The amendment provides that a secured creditor, who proceeds to realise its security interest, shall contribute its share of the insolvency resolution process cost, liquidation process cost and workmen’s dues, within 90 days of the liquidation commencement date. It shall also pay excess of realised value of the asset, which is subject to security interest, over the amount of its claims admitted, within 180 days of the liquidation commencement date. Where the secured creditor fails to pay such amounts to the Liquidator within 90 days or 180 days, as the case may be, the asset shall become part of Liquidation Estate.

The amendment provides that a Liquidator shall deposit the amount of unclaimed dividends, if any, and undistributed proceeds, if any, in a liquidation process along with any income earned thereon into the Corporate Liquidation Account before he submits an application for dissolution of the corporate debtor. It also provides a process for a stakeholder to seek withdrawal from the Corporate Liquidation Account.

The amended regulations are effective from 6th January 2020. These are available at www.mca.gov.in and www.ibbi.gov.in.

                On 31 Jan 2020, IAF achieved another milestone, when an AN-32 aircraft of the Indian Air Force, powered with a 10% blend of Indian bio-jet fuel took-off from Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport, Leh. This is the first time that both engines of the aircraft were powered by the bio-jet indigenous fuel. The aircraft was flight tested and its performance was validated at Chandigarh Air Base prior to undertaking the operational flight to Leh.

 

            Leh at an altitude of 10,682 ft above mean sea level, is amongst one of world’s highest and most difficult operational airfield, it is prone to extreme weather conditions. Even during clear weather conditions, landing and taking-off an aircraft at Leh, is challenging due to reduced power output of the aircraft engines in the rarefied atmosphere, turbulent wind conditions and proximity of mountainous terrain. Evaluating the performance of bio-jet fuel under these conditions is important from operational perspectives. It validates the capability of the aero-engine to operate smoothly with
bio-jet fuel at the extremities of the operational envelope. The tests were conducted by a team comprising of test pilots from the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment, Bengaluru and pilots from the operational squadrons.

 

            This successful test flight also demonstrates IAF’s capabilities to absorb newer technology, while sponsoring indigenization. The technology to produce this fuel was developed by CSIR-IIP in 2013, but could not be tested and certified for commercial use due to lack of concurrent aviation test facilities in the country. In 2018, the IAF sponsored this project and channelized its human and material resources for the complete range of fuel testing.

 

            Bio-jet fuel is produced from non-edible ‘Tree Borne Oils’, grown and procured from the tribal areas of Chhattisgarh state. IAF’s efforts would assist in reducing carbon footprint and India’s dependence on crude imports.

The FTX curriculum is progressively planned where the participants will initially get familiar with each other’s organizational structure and tactical drills. Subsequently, joint tactical exercise will be conducted wherein the battle drills of both the armies will be practiced. The training will culminate with a final validation exercise in which troops of both armies will jointly practice a Counter Terrorist Operation in a controlled and simulated environment.

In addition, to understand each other at tactical level, greater cultural understanding will be emphasized to strengthen military trust and cooperation between two nations.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has said India is fully capable of giving a firm response to cross-border terrorism, and strikes against terrorist attacks in 2016 and 2019 have demonstrated the nation's firm resolve to defeat terrorism. Addressing the inaugural session of 12th South Asian Conference at Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis here today, Shri Singh reiterated the government's stand that talks and terror cannot go together and asked Pakistan to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India from its soil. 

 

Raksha Mantri said that India was engaged in conversations with its neighbour in order to develop joint approaches for regional peace and security. He called upon the member countries of the regional outfit SAARC or South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to be united in efforts to defeat terrorism. Shri Rajnath Singh said that with the exception of Pakistan, the SAARC countries have adhered to the principles of non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and not supporting cross-border terrorism. 

 

Without naming any country, Raksha Mantri said that full potential of SAARC has not been realized due to the behaviour and policies of a single country and cited how the SAARC motor vehicles agreement was stalled at the last Kathmandu session in 2015. He further said that the same country has preferred to use terrorism as a state policy towards India, rather than peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue. Shri Rajnath Singh said, use of terror as an instrument of its foreign and security policy has promoted radicalism and terrorism in the region and posed critical challenges to security of all states. He said that the Easter Bomb attacks in April 2019 were the latest instance of how dangerous such a policy has been for the region and beyond. He stressed that the terror attacks in Mumbai, Pathankot, Uri and Pulwama in India were grim reminders of state-sponsored terrorism by a neighbouring country. Shri Rajnath Singh said that as the largest country in the region, India has always made efforts to share its prosperity with its neighbourhood. Explaining the essential contours of the Government's Neighbourhood First Policy or NFP, he said that the mutually beneficial and broad-based approach, comprising both the components of development and security, was inclusive and sensitive to the priorities of the neighbouring countries. He said that the Government has recognised the neighbourhood as the most important foreign policy priority.

 

Stressing the need of the regional unity and cooperation, Shri Rajnath Singh said that India has always harboured the cultural ethos of brotherhood and the traditional knowledge through Vedas, Upanishad has and Puranas have taught the country the strength of unity. He added that the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a firm belief in the principle of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas and it will bring win-win situation for all.

 

Informing that the Government has committed about 13.14 billion US dollars in credit-lines and about 4 billion US dollars in assistance in the neighbourhood over the last decade, Raksha Mantri said that India is willing to play a leading and critical role at the development front under NFP, by making resources available to the neighbours to build necessary infrastructure that will enable connectivity and easy flow of region-wide movement of goods, services, people and ideas.

 

Stating that South Asia is at a critical juncture of history where a world of opportunity is beckoning, Shri Rajnath Singh said that regional prosperity should not be held hostage to the interests of select states who are obstructing all efforts aimed at regional cooperation. He said that intra-regional trade has so far been abysmally low, and underlined the need to transcend the limitations. 

 

Talking about the conference and the organisers, Raksha Mantri said that such events by the civil society can influence governments through their proactive efforts adding that regional civil society of South Asia has a duty to encourage efforts like this. He also called upon the civil society of the region to help create a culture of cooperation in the region.

 

The IDSA Director General Ambassador Shri Sujan R Chinoy and other senior military & civil officials of the Ministry of Defence were also present on the occasion.

                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is committed to the indigenous development of defence systems. Continuous innovation in advanced defence technology has led to many pathbreaking systems being realised in the country. This year’s Republic Day parade at Rajpath today saw many defence systems developed by DRDO as part of the contingents of the Armed Forces and DRDO. 

The DRDO-developed products such as surface-to-air-missile ‘Akash’, Mobile Bridging System ‘Sarvatra’, beyond visual range air-to-air missile ‘Astra’, Light Combat Aircraft ‘Tejas’, Air Defence Tactical Control Radar (ADTCR) and Anti-Satellite Missile (ASAT) were displayed as part of different tableaux of DRDO and the Armed Forces. 

The DRDO showcased the ASAT missile used in Mission Shakti. Maiden successful trial of ASAT was carried out on March 27, 2019. Mission Shakti, the test mission, was a major breakthrough in demonstrating the nation’s anti-satellite technology and precision strike capability. ASAT will play a critical role in providing necessary deterrence against rogue satellites as well as intercontinental ballistic missiles. 

The ADTCR, the other presentation from DRDO, is used for volumetric surveillance, detection, tracking and friend/foe identification of aerial targets of different types. The radar is capable of detecting very small targets and low flying targets.

                The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is making an invaluable contribution towards national integration and nation building through their yeomen service of transforming the youth of the country into a cohesive and disciplined force. This was stated by Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh while addressing NCC cadets and senior civil & military officers during his visit to NCC Republic Day Camp 2020 at Delhi Cantt today. 

“NCC plays an unparalleled role in transforming the youth into future leaders. Today, NCC cadets can be found in almost every field, including Armed Forces, politics and sports. Even Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, who is taking our country to newer heights, was an NCC cadet,” said Shri Rajnath Singh. He also recalled his days as a cadet of the largest uniformed youth organisation in the world. 

Raksha Mantri lauded NCC for instilling a sense of national pride among the younger generation which paves the way for a stronger India. He recalled the supreme sacrifice made by Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and Ashfaqullah Khan, saying that freedom fighters like them had that sense of national pride that fulfilled the dream of an independent India. 

Shri Rajnath Singh took note of the fact that NCC has in its ranks 14 lakh cadets from different parts of the country, expressing hope that every school and college of the country will have NCC presence in the near future. He lauded NCC cadets for assistance during natural calamities as well as contributing in social awareness activities like Swachhta Abhiyan. He also complimented them for making a mark in sports and adventurous activities. 

Shri Rajnath Singh mentioned that increasing the total number of awards in various categories in NCC to 243 from 143 was one of his first decisions he took as Raksha Mantri. The cash awards of these medals and commendations was also increased. He hoped that these awards will enhance the enthusiasm of cadets and inspire them to greater achievements. 

Earlier, Shri Rajnath Singh gave away Raksha Mantri Padak and Commendation Cards to NCC cadets for their exemplary performance and devotion to duty during the investiture ceremony. This year, the Raksha Mantri Padak was awarded to Lieutenant Raison Sam Raju of Kerala & Lakshadweep Directorate and Under Officer Rahul Sharma of Uttar Pradesh Directorate. Raksha Mantri Commendation Cards were awarded to Sr Under Officer Shavetana Sambyal, Jammu and Kashmir Directorate, Capt (Dr) Rajeev Thomas, Kerala and Lakshadweep Directorate, Sr GCI Seema Rai, Uttar Pradesh Directorate and Cadet Soumya Ghosh, West Bengal and Sikkim Directorate. Raksha Mantri Padak, instituted in 1989, is awarded to the most deserving cadet every year for bravery or exceptional service of the highest order. 

Raksha Mantri was received by Director General NCC Lt Gen Rajeev Chopra. Shri Rajnath Singh inspected the Guard of Honour presented by a contingent of NCC cadets drawn from the Army, Navy and the Air Force wings of NCC. He also visited the Flag Area prepared by the cadets from all the 17 NCC Directorates, depicting various social awareness themes. He was briefed by the cadets on their respective models. Raksha Mantri also visited the 'Hall of Fame', which has an archival collection of alumni photographs, models and other achievements of NCC. 

Shri Rajnath Singh and other distinguished guests also witnessed a colourful cultural programme presented by the cadets. Raksha Mantri congratulated the cadets and the entire NCC fraternity for putting up an impressive parade, band display and cultural programme. He also extended his best wishes to the 114 foreign NCC cadets from various friendly countries.

                Indian Navy has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Geological Survey of India (GSI) for ‘Sharing of seabed sediments data, products and expertise for Naval Application in Meteorology and Oceanography’. The MoU was signed today between Commodore AA Abhyankar, who heads Indian Navy’s Oceanology and Meteorology Directorate and Shri N Maran, Deputy Director General of GSI.

GSI’s Marine and Coastal survey Division based at Mangaluru has mapped most of India’s 2.1 Million km2  Exclusive Economic Zone and has a vast repository of offshore data. This data collected using GSI’s state-of-the-art oceanic research vessels Samudra Manthan, Samudra Kaustubh, Samudra Shaudhikama and Samudra Ratnakar, will now be used by Indian Navy’s rapidly growing blue water fleet for reliable and accurate oceanographic modeling to support their expansive maritime operations in the Indian Ocean region

                The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) headed by Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh, in its first meeting of 2020 met today to consider a number of new and ongoing proposals for procuring critically needed platforms and equipment for the Armed Forces.

To promote indigenisation, the DAC accorded approval for procurement of equipment worth over Rs 5,100 crore from indigenous sources. These include sophisticated Electronic Warfare Systems for the Army designed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured locally by the Indian industry. These systems will be used in deserts and plains and will provide comprehensive Electronic Support and Counter Measure capabilities to the field formations in both communication and other aspects of Electronic Warfare.

The DAC also approved prototype testing of trawl assemblies designed by DRDO for T-72 and T-90 tanks providing an important indigenous de-mining capability to the Army.

In another significant step, the DAC approved shortlisting of Indian Strategic Partners (SP) and the potential Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that would collaborate with SPs to construct six conventional submarines in India. This programme is being progressed under the 'Strategic Partnership Model', promulgated in 2017 to give a major boost to 'Make in India' in Defence Sector. The Strategic partner is expected to play a transformational role in building an eco-system in the country, comprising development entities, specialised vendors and suppliers; especially those from the MSME sector. SP Model also aims at promoting India as a manufacturing hub for defence equipment, in addition to establishing an industrial and R&D eco-system capable of meeting the future requirements of the Armed Forces besides giving boost to exports.

The DAC also accorded approval for inclusion of Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) in Defence Procurement Procedure. This would provide avenues in capital procurement for the Armed Forces to startups and innovators working for iDEX and provide huge fillip to their budding efforts.

                50 trekkers including nine foreign nationals and approximately equal number of local guides and porters, who were a part of the ongoing ‘Chadar Trek’, got stranded when some portions of the frozen Zanskar River melted. The melting caused the flow of the water to become too strong, for the trekkers to continue across the river on foot. The stranded trekkers managed to move to Niraq, a small camp site upstream and were awaiting to be rescued. To carry out a rescue by helicopters, a makeshift helipad was prepared along the river bank. ALH helicopters were immediately pressed into action from AF Stn Leh. 

IAF’s helicopters have rescued 107 individuals during the last two days.The rescued trekkers include one male and one female from France and four male and three females from People’s Republic of China, who as per the information were rescued from Padum. IAF will continue the ongoing rescue operation till all the stranded trekkers, guides and porters are evacuated and brought to safety. Additionally, in order to provide medical facilities to the stranded trekkers a medical officer and a medical assistant were also flown from AF Stn Leh to Niraq. The team has setup a medical assistance camp at Niraq and are providing basic medical assistance to the stranded trekkers.

The operations were undertaken by IAF in close coordination with Ladakh’s newly formed Civil Administration, nearby Indian Army units and local Disaster Relief Teams.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh flagged off 51st K9 VAJRA-T Gun from Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Armoured System Complex at Hazira in Gujarat today. Addressing a gathering on the occasion, Raksha Mantri called for active participation of the private sector in defence manufacturing, reaffirming the Government’s commitment to make India an arms manufacturing hub and net defence exporter. While Shri Rajnath Singh acknowledged the increasing participation of the private industry in defence production, he stressed that a lot still needs to be done to make India a global defence manufacturing hub.

“Our Government is open to new ideas and is determined to use the energy, entrepreneurship spirit and enterprise of the private industry in the defence sector,” Raksha Mantri said. He assured that the Government will make all efforts to remove any roadblocks and work together to achieve the goal of indigenisation and self-reliance in defence sector.     

Shri Rajnath Singh also listed out various far reaching reforms introduced by the Government under the ‘Make in India’ initiative to achieve $26 billion defence industry by 2025 and provide employment to 2-3 million people. “We wish to create an ecosystem that provides a platform to both public sector and private sector to work together and contribute to nation building through their strengths and experiences,” he added.

Some of the reforms highlighted by Raksha Mantri include setting up of Defence corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu; simplification of industry licensing process; increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) cap; steps to promote defence exports; streamlining of Defence offsets policy; establishing Defence Investor Cell; providing Government-owned trial and testing facility to the private sector and schemes for startups and small & medium enterprises to promote innovation. He also mentioned that the Strategic Partnership (SP) model has been introduced in the Defence Production Policy under which private sector will be able to manufacture fighter aircraft, helicopters, submarines and armoured vehicles and emerge as global giants. Shri Rajnath Singh commended L&T for ensuring their participation under the SP model.               

Raksha Mantri expressed satisfaction on his visit to the Armoured System Complex, saying that the facility is a strong example of ‘Naye Bharat ki Nayi Soch’. He added that the goal of modernisation and indigenisation in defence under 'Make in India', conceptualised by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has started to take shape. Shri Rajnath Singh termed K9 VAJRA-T Gun as the best example of ‘Make in India’ in Defence. “I have been told that more than 75 per cent of K9 Vajra has been manufactured in India. Over 5,000 people have got direct employment and more than 12,500 indirect employment through this complex. It is a matter of great pride,” he said. Raksha Mantri congratulated L&T for delivering 51 of the 100 orders it received for K9 Vajra ahead of schedule.

L&T Defence is currently executing the ‘K9 VAJRA-T’ Tracked, Self-Propelled Howitzer Guns program - the contract awarded to the company by Ministry of Defence through global competitive bidding.

L&T Group Chairman Shri AM Naik and officials of L&T and Ministry of Defence were present on the occasion.

                Defence Secretary Dr Ajay Kumar and Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Defence of Finland Mr Jukka Juusti signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to further defence cooperation between India and Finland, here today. The MoU on co-operation in the field of Production, Procurement, Research and Development of Defence related Equipment and Industrial cooperation has been inked on the sidelines of Raisina Dialogue 2020. Under the broad ambit of the MoU, cooperation between Finnish companies and Indian Defence Public Sector Undertakings could be explored. 

A draft MoU between the two countries in the field of defence cooperation amongst others was under discussion since the DefExpo 2018 and has now been formalised in the run up to DefExpo 2020, to be held in Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow between February 5-9, 2020. 

In 2019, Mr Juusti had led a delegation to Aero India in Bengaluru and post his visit, the Permanent Secretary had evinced their interest to participate in the ‘Make in India’ vision and formalise an arrangement for Defence Industrial cooperation through an MoU. 

On February 13, 2016, Prime Minister of Finland Mr Juha Sipila had bilateral discussions with Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during his visit to India for the inauguration of the ‘Make in India’ week. In April 17, 2018, Prime Minister Modi held a bilateral meeting with Mr Sipila during the first India-Nordic Summit in Stockholm, Sweden. Also, a delegation from Finland had visited India between November 29 – December 02, 2018 to explore new business opportunities for Finnish companies.

                One of the Key Result Area for Indian Navy has been fuel quality standards revision to keep pace with induction of new technology equipment and meet contemporary emission standards. With the advent of technology and refining techniques in the petroleum industry better quality of fuel abiding to more stringent specifications has become a necessity. Hence, continuous improvement in technical specification for diesels is the primary focus area.

            Leveraging technology and improved refining techniques available with the country’s petroleum industry, the Indian Navy in collaboration with M/s IOCL carried out an extensive and thorough study and a comparative evaluation of existing international regulations (ISO, MARPOL, NATO etc). As an outcome, a revised technical specification was arrived at consisting of 22 test parameters including critical parameters cetane number, flash point, sulphur content, sediment content, oxidation stability and Cold Filter Plugging Point (CFPP). The new specification will not only ensure a better quality fuel but also result in a reduced carbon footprint. 

            M/s IOCL, post upgradation of the refinery units, initiated limited supply of the product to Indian Navy platforms following which rigorous machinery performance checks and acceptance trials were carried out. Distinct improvements in fuel quality were observed. Given the positive results, the new fuel was therefore decided for pan Navy implementation. On 13 January 2020, the launch of the new fuel (High Flash High Speed Diesel) HFHSD – IN 512, with revised technical specifications was undertaken. 

            With this, the country will be able to ensure interoperability amongst foreign navies during fleet exercises and provide fuel of quality better than that mandated to all foreign navies under bilateral/ multi-national logistics support pacts including LEMOA (Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement). 

            Successful introduction of the new fuel is a landmark occasion highlighting the enormous potential which exists within the country to produce world class products. This effort would also benefit other M/s IOCL consumers in the country like Indian Coast Guard and other merchant marine in the coming years. The achievement would also mark a new high with quality fuel available to all foreign Navy ships at Indian ports during exercises with the Indian Navy. 

            This revolutionary initiative would go a long way in enhancing equipment reliability, performance, reduced carbon footprint, emissions and more importantly would be key enabler in the Navy’s ‘Mission Based Deployment’ on a global scale.

                After successfully hosting the International Fleet Review (IFR) in Feb 2016, the City of Destiny Visakhapatnam is gearing up to host another International Naval event ‘MILAN’ in March 2020.   With about two months to the mega event, the preparations were reviewed at the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) by Vice Admiral SN Ghormade, Chief of Staff ENC on 07 January 2020.  The review meeting saw an overwhelming and positive response from the civil administrators and stakeholder organisations, with participation by Dr G. Srijana Commissioner GVMC, Shri Rajiv Kumar Meena, City Police Commissioner, Shri A Srinivas Secretary VMRDA, Shri RN Hari Krishna, Chief Mechanical Engineer VPT, representatives from HSL, HPCL, IOCL, EPCL, Coromandel Fertilizers Ltd and Senior Police Officers from Special Branch, Law & Order, and Traffic. 

A detailed presentation to apprise the attendees of the planned activities of MILAN was conducted. Vice Admiral SN Ghormade has solicited wholehearted support and cooperation from the City Administration, Civic Bodies, Police Department and PSUs in co-hosting the multinational Naval event as was done during IFR in 2016. The review meeting was followed by site visits to various venues by the Nodal officers from the Navy and the attendees representing stakeholder organisations towards drawing out time bound action plans.   

MILAN 2020 is a multilateral naval exercise aimed to enhance professional interaction between friendly foreign navies and learn from each other’s strengths and best practices in the maritime domain. The Exercise with the theme ‘Synergy Across the Seas’ would provide an excellent opportunity for Operational Commanders of friendly foreign navies to interact with each other in areas of mutual interest. Of the 41 navies invited, confirmations from over 30 navies have been received towards their participation in MILAN 2020.

                The tableau of the Indian Navy, to be showcased at the Republic Day Parade on January 26, 2020 at Rajpath, was unveiled here today.The tableau is in pursuance of the Navy Week theme ‘Indian Navy - Silent, Strong, and Swift’.

The forward part of the tableau showcases the might and fire power of Navy in all three dimensions viz surface, sub-surface and air. This is portrayed through models of state-of-the-art assets like Boeing P8I Long Range Maritime Patrol aircraft with Harpoon missiles, Kolkata class Stealth Destroyer displaying a Brahmos launch and Kalvari Class Submarine launching the Exocet missile.

On the trailer, the tableau showcases the indigenous aircraft carrier Vikrant under construction at Cochin Shipyard Limited, along with its complement of MiG 29K Fighter Aircraft. This not only depicts the strength of the Indian Navy but is representative of the Navy's total commitment to the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government.

The benign role of the Navy in terms of safeguarding offshore economic assets as well as rendering Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) is portrayed through the murals on the sides. These depict flood relief operation undertaken in Maharashtra on Mahalaxml Express (Op Varsha Rahat) in July2019, escort operations undertaken in Persian Gulf (Op Sankalp) and defence of our oil platforms by Fast Attack Craft and employment of MARCOS.

Overall, the tableau aims to showcase the Navy as a credible and combat ready military force, which in service of the nation, protects its economic assets and providessuccour to its populace in times of crisis and natural calamities.

The officers who would be leading the Naval contingent as Contingent Commander, Platoon Commanders and the Naval Tableaux during the parade and the Drum Major who would be leading the Indian Naval Band were also introduced during the press preview.

                INS Sumedha, presently on Anti Piracy Patrol in Gulf of Aden, came to the rescue of the crew of the dhow Al-Hamid on 06 Jan 20. A traditional wooden vessel known as ""Dhow"", Al-Hamid was detected by an IN Helicopter launched from the deck of INS Sumedha, which confirmed that the vessel was in distress and drifting near the coast of Somalia.



A boarding team along with a naval technical team embarked Al-Hamid for routine checks onboard and render assistance. The crew of Al-Hamid comprised 13 Indian Citizens. The technical team assessment revealed that the dhow had suffered a broken main engine shaft, which was not repairable at sea. The dhow was then towed to safety away from the Somali coast.

Meanwhile, the owner of the dhow Al-Hamid  has sent another vessel for towing the dhow to port for repairs. Before departure, Indian Naval Ship Sumedha provided fresh water and medical supplies to the crew of the dhow.

                Director General of National Cadet Corps (NCC) Lt Gen Rajeev Chopra has emphasised that the NCC is committed to grooming the youth into responsible citizens who contribute immensely in nation building. Addressing the annual press conference during the NCC Republic Day Camp (RDC) here today, the DG NCC highlighted the major role of NCC in empowering the youth in nation building, creating social awareness, community development, environment protection, sports and adventure among them.

Lt Gen Chopra said, the training philosophy of the NCC cadets has been refined to accommodate the changing aspirations of the youth and expectations of the society. “The focus is now on personality development, leadership traits and improving soft skills of the cadets, so as to equip them for future challenges,” he added. 

The DG NCC highlighted that Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) have been signed with 10 countries for Youth Exchange Programme (YEP). However, to give the cadets a wider exposure, YEP with seven more countries is in an advanced stage of approval, he said.

The RDC 2020 commenced at the Cariappa Parade Ground on January 01, 2020. Lt Gen Chopra addressed the cadets & officials and asked the cadets to participate wholeheartedly and derive maximum benefits from each activity during the camp.

The aim of the RDC is to provide an exposure to the rich culture and traditions of the country through important events that take place in the national capital during the run up to the Republic Day as well as to enhance the personal traits of the cadets by strengthening their value system. Cadets attending the camp participate in a number of activities like cultural competitions, national integration awareness programme and various institutional training competitions. 

A total of 2,155 cadets, including 710 girls, drawn from all 28 states and nine Union Territories (UTs), are participating in this month-long camp. They include cadets from UTs of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and 120 cadets from the North Eastern Region. Portraying a reflection of ‘Mini India’, the camp will be visited by a number of dignitaries, including Raksha Mantri, Raksha Rajya Mantri, Chief of Defence Staff, the Chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force and the Chief Minister of Delhi. The camp will culminate with the customary Prime Minister’s rally on January 28.

A number of competitions will take place during the camp, wherein all 17 directorates compete for the coveted Prime Minister’s Banner which is presented by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during the PM rally. A large number of selected cadets will get an opportunity to participate in the prestigious Republic Day Parade on January 26 at Rajpath.

                Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh launched Ministry of Defence (MoD) No Objection Certificate (NOC) web portal www.modnoc.ncog.gov.in for undertaking aerial survey with the final permission of Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), here today. Shri Rajnath Singh suggested that internal mechanism should be developed to monitor the time taken to give NOC. The portal will be used by various vendors engaged by State Governments/Public Sector Undertakings/Autonomous bodies in seeking NOC from MoD. 

Defence Secretary Dr Ajay Kumar explained the salient features and benefits of the portal, hosted on National Informatics Centre platform. He informed that through this initiative, MoD will be able to considerably reduce the time usually taken in issuing NOC. Among other benefits, this initiative will help in speeding up developmental projects undertaken by various agencies. Further, this will also ensure expeditious disposal of applications for carrying out aerial survey, besides bringing in more transparency and accuracy. 

Defence Secretary also requested DGCA to issue suitable notification to all concerned so that the applicants/vendors could submit their applications online on the newly developed web portal of MoD. To facilitate the applicants/vendors, an e-book has also been uploaded on the above web portal. 

Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria and other senior officials from MoD, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and DGCA were also present on the occasion.

                Soon after assuming charge as Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), General Bipin Rawat held a meeting with important functionaries of Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff (Hq IDS) on January 1, 2020.Wishing them all a Happy New Year, General Rawat directed various branch heads to come up with recommendations for inter-service synergy and jointness in a time bound manner.

The CDS also directed that a proposal to create Air Defence Command be prepared by June 30, 2020. He also set out priorities for execution of synergy by June30 and December, 31 2020. Some of the areas identified for jointness and synergy include creation of common logistics support pools in stations where two or more services have their presence.

Emphasising collegiate system of functioning, General Rawat directed that all three services and Coast Guard must be consulted and their views obtained in a time bound manner. Decisions will, however, be taken to ensure optimisation of resources. Efforts will be made to cut out infructuous ceremonial activities, which are manpower intensive.

The CDS stressed that all must work towards accomplishing desired results and comingup with healthy views and ideas.

                There is a well-established system for selection of tableaux for participation in the Republic Day Parade as per which Ministry of Defence invites proposals for tableau from all States/UTs and Central Ministries/Departments.

The tableaux proposals received from various States/UTs and Central Ministries/Departments are evaluated in a series of meetings of the Expert Committee comprising of eminent persons in the field of art, culture, painting, sculpture, music, architecture, choreography etc. The Expert Committee examines the proposals on the basis of theme, concept, design and its visual impact before making its recommendations. Due to time constraints arising out of overall duration of the parade, only a limited number of tableaux can be shortlisted for participation in the parade. The selection process in vogue, leads to participation of the best tableaux in the parade.

For Republic Day Parade 2020, a total of 56 tableaux proposals (32 from States/UTs and 24 from Ministries/Departments) were received. Out of these, 22 proposals, comprising of 16 States/UTs and 6 Ministries/Departments, have finally been shortlisted for participation in the Republic Day Parade 2020 after a series of five meetings.

The tableau proposal of Govt. of West Bengal was examined by the Expert Committee in two rounds of meetings. The tableau proposal of Govt. of West Bengal was not taken forward for further consideration by the Expert Committee after deliberations in the second meeting. It is pertinent to mention here that the tableau of Govt. of West Bengal was shortlisted for participation in Republic Day Parade 2019 as an outcome of the same process.

                The Union Minister of State (I/C) Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh chaired a high level meeting with senior officials of the Gujarat Government here today to review preparations for the forthcoming Madhavpur Mela of Gujarat. The Secretary, DoNER, Dr Inder Jit Singh, Secretary, North Eastern Council (NEC), Shri K. Moses Chalai and senior officers of NEC, besides Resident Commissioners/representatives of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur also participated.

Dr Jitendra Singh directed the officials that events including cultural performances, crafts display and food festivals of the NER region be showcased in major cities of Gujarat including Ahmedabad to generate wider interest among the local population. He said the Madhavpur Mela will mark the cultural integration of Gujarat with the North-East under the Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat announced by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

The annual fair is held at Madhavpur Ghed in Porbandar district and the Mela this year will commence on 2nd April, a day after the Ram Navami festival. The eight States of the Northern Eastern Region will participate in a big way during the Madhavpur Mela 

Madhavpur Ghed, a small but culturally significant village, is the place where, according to folklore, Lord Krishna married Rukmini, the daughter of King Bhishmaka. Madhavpur lies on the seashore, close to Porbandar. A 15th century Madhavrai temple marks the site. This event is commemorated by a cultural fair held every year, commencing on Ram Navami. A colourful chariot carrying the idol of Lord Krishna circumnavigates the village and the festivities usually continue for five days.

The week-long ‘Utsav’ will see a vibrant cultural trail of art, dance, music, poetry, story-telling and folk drama from Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and other North-Eastern States with the aim to integrate the rich cultures of the two regions.

Dr Jitendra Singh later held a Review Meeting of the Ministry of DoNER. He was informed about the progress of utilization of funds by different States under various schemes of NEC and MDoNER with special focus on Manipur, setting up of Bamboo Industrial Park at Dima Hasao district of Assam and digital/virtual classrooms in the NER, student hostels at JNU and Rohini and North-East Convention Centre (NECC) at Dwarka in New Delhi besides examining viability of introduction of sea plane at Brahmaputra River Front and Umrangso Reservoir under UDAN 3.0 of Regional Connectivity Scheme of the Civil Aviation Ministry. Dr Jitendra Singh stressed on expediting and setting deadlines for completion of projects.

During the meeting Dr Jitendra Singh, who is also the Vice-Chairman of the NEC, lauded the decision of the Union Cabinet today approving allocation of thirty percent of the NEC’s allocation for new projects for focused development of deprived areas, neglected sections of society and emerging priority sectors. He thanked the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is also the Chairman of the NEC, for the momentous decision.

The projects under the existing “Schemes of NEC” will accrue socioeconomic benefits to the marginalized and vulnerable groups of people in backward and neglected areas of the North Eastern States. It will lead to faster decision making and quick implementation of the projects.

On the occasion Dr Jitendra Singh also gave away certificates and prize money to winners of the Decipher North-East Quiz contest.

 A delegation led by the Ambassador of Japan, Mr Satoshi Suzuki called on the Union Minister of State (I/C) Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh, here today. 



During the meeting, various issues related to mutual collaboration and cooperation between the two countries were discussed. There is huge Japanese investment in infrastructure projects in the North Eastern region of the country. The upgradation of Aizwal- Tuipang Section of NH 54 with a length of 372 km is being done with JICA assistance at a cost of Rs 6168 Cr. This road would provide seamless connectivity to Sittwe port in Mayanmar as part of Government’s Act East Policy. In the area of forest management, there is Japanese collaboration with the State Governments of Tripura, Sikkim and Nagaland and soon there will be collaboration with the state of Meghalaya in this field. Among other issues, mutual collaboration in the areas of bamboo, disaster management, road infrastructure and Guwahati Sewerage project, was also discussed. 



Discussing the role of mutual cooperation between the two countries, it was mentioned that meeting of Indo-Japan Working Group on Nuclear Energy Cooperation is scheduled to be held next month. On the issue of collaboration between India and Japan in the area of outer space, it was mentioned that bilateral discussions were held last year. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that India shares traditional relations with Japan. He said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, new areas of mutual collaboration are being added to it. The Minister mentioned about the Bullet train project in this regard. He added that during the last five years, Japanese engagement in India’s infrastructure projects has increased. Recently 12 nursing caregivers from J&K and Ladakh have been taken up for jobs in Japan through initiative of private agencies, the Minister added.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir has huge Bamboo reserves that can boost its economy in future. He was inaugurating a workshop-cum-exhibition on “Bamboo-A wonder grass” at Convention Centre, Jammu today. The workshop-cum-exhibition is being jointly organised by the North Eastern Council (NEC),  Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Government of India and Government of Jammu and Kashmir through Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre (CBTC), Guwahati, Assam and Department of Social Forestry, Government of Jammu and Kashmir. Shri G.C. Murmu, Lt. Governor of Jammu and Kashmir and senior officers  were also present on the occasion. 

While inaugurating the workshop, Dr Jitendra Singh said that bamboo cultivation can revolutionise the industry in Jammu and Kashmir in a cost-effective manner and can open new gates for the young start-ups. While referring to a series of workshops and conferences being organised in J&K, the Minister said that this is the 4th conference within a short span of 3 months. He said that under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, it has been decided to institutionalize every outreach initiative for the welfare of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Other ministries are also conducting programs with an aim to go deeper to the district level and then to the assembly segment level, he added. He further said that the  UT Govt. is in the process of identifying 100 venues and will identify the programs to be held there in the first phase.



The Minister also emphasized on the fact that it is the time to apply the same amount of focus on Jammu and Kashmir as has been applied to North-East in recent years which has totally transformed the region into a heaven for start ups. There is an expectation that Jammu and Kashmir will too emerge as a great economic zone and successful practices of governance and development can be easily replicated in Jammu and Kashmir, he said.

Speaking on the sidelines of the exhibition, the Minister said that the development of UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh is being given special focus after the abrogation of Article 370. Dr Singh also said  that the dream of a 5 trillion economy can not be achieved unless we follow the global parameters. The new industrial policy is in the line so that we would have more investment here which will create more jobs for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir, he added.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that every important project related to Jammu and Kashmir  that was stuck up  is now being  cleared.  He spoke about the Bathinda gas pipeline project, Uj river water project, Shahpur Kandi Project, Pakaldul Project to Kiru Project. This will bring a new dawn into the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, he added. 

During the workshop-cum-exhibition, Dr. Jitendra Singh also inaugurated Bamboo and Cane cluster stalls established by eight states of North Eastern Region and exhibition stalls. He also visited live stations established by various departments of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir.

Lt. Governor, UT of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri. G.C. Murmu emphasised on the fact that Bamboo being eco-friendly can help us saving the environment from pollution and can become a means of livelihood as well. The need of the hour is to find the economic use of it in Jammu and Kashmir as we have huge resources of Bamboo here, he added.  

Addressing the workshop-cum-exhibition, Shri. K. Moses Chalai, Secretary, North Eastern Council, Govt. of India said that both North-East and Jammu and Kashmir have a great potential to grow together in Bamboo technology and this workshop is a good beginning to have a bamboo skill development in Jammu and Kashmir on the lines of North Eastern region.   

Earlier in her welcome address, Ms Sarita Chauhan, Commissioner Secretary, Department of Forests, Environment and Ecology, Government of Jammu and Kashmir said that this workshop-cum-exhibition will boost the Jammu and Kashmir economy in future and this workshop will broaden the vision about it especially through the technical sessions.

                The eight States of the Northern Eastern Region will participate in a big way during the Madhavpur Mela of Gujarat due to be held in the first week of April this year. The annual fair is held at Madhavpur Ghed in Porbandar district and the Mela this year will commence on 2nd April, a day after the Ram Navami festival. The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh chaired a high level meeting with senior officials of the Gujarat Government here today to review preparations for the mega festival. Secretary, North Eastern Council (NEC), Shri Moses Chalai and senior officers of NEC, besides Resident Commissioners/representatives of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur also participated.



Dr Jitendra Singh directed the officials that besides Madhavpur, events including cultural performances, crafts display and food festivals of the NER region be showcased in other major cities of Gujarat including Ahmedabad to generate wider interest among the local population. He suggested that a logo bringing out the common links between Gujarat and the North-East be designed and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), Zonal Cultural Centres (ZCCs), Song and Drama Division of Information & Broadcasting Ministry besides the concerned departments of the State Governments be actively involved in various activities. A multimedia publicity campaign will be launched on March 1, 2020 to popularize the Madhavpur Mela. This will mark the cultural integration of Gujarat with the North-East under the Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat announced by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, he added.



 The Madhavpur Mela of Gujarat shares its connect to the Mishmi Tribe of Arunachal Pradesh. The Mishmi Tribe traces its ancestry to the legendary King Bhishmak and through him to his daughter Rukmini and Lord Krishna. The festival celebrates the immortal journey which Rukmini undertook from Arunachal Pradesh to Gujarat with Lord Krishna. Bhismaknagar, located near Roing in the lower Dibang Valley district, also finds mention in Kalika Purana.

The week-long ‘Utsav’ will see a vibrant cultural trail of art, dance, music, poetry, story-telling and folk drama from Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and other North-Eastern States with the aim to integrate the rich cultures of the two regions.

Madhavpur Ghed, a small but culturally significant village, is the place where, according to folklore, Lord Krishna married Rukmini, the daughter of King Bhishmaka. Madhavpur lies on the seashore, close to Porbandar. A 15th century Madhavrai temple marks the site. This event is commemorated by a cultural fair held every year, commencing on Ram Navami. A colourful chariot carrying the idol of Lord Krishna circumnavigates the village and the festivities usually continue for five days. 

Madhavpur Mela this year will witness magnificent folk cultural performances from the North-East, especially Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. Troupes from Assam will perform Rukmini-Haran, a popular folk theatre of the region. Musical troupe from Manipur will sing songs related to Rukmini in the Khullong Ishei and Nat genŕe.  Dance-dramas based on Rukmini-Krishna legends from Arunachal and Manipur and folk dance of the Idu Mishmi tribe from Arunachal will be part of the varied repertoire.

An exposition and sale of art and crafts of Gujarat and handloom and handicrafts products from Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and other North-Eastern states will be part of the event. A Visual Art Exhibition on Krishna and Rukmini put together by different institutions of Ministry of Culture like the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts and Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya highlighting the variegated legends of Krishna and Rukmini will be the main attraction.

Shri Pokhriyal said that to showcase the good work we are doing and get better representation for India, we need our National Commission to be stronger and more active. He suggested the five Sub Commissions to meet regularly on their own to discuss the work they are doing and identify the challenges they are facing. They should inform National Commission of all developments in their respective sectors for proper coordination. The Minster hoped that the National Commission will identify and take up issues in India’s interest with the UNESCO Headquarters through the Permanent Representative of India. 

While addressing the meeting Shri Dhotre said that India has always played an active role in promoting its ideals and objectives in the fields of education, culture, communication, natural sciences & social and human sciences. He highlighted that the concerned ministries of the government are making consistent efforts towards fulfilment of UNESCO's objectives and attainment of 2030 sustainable development goals in their respective sectors. He added that the Indian National Commission and its five sub commissions can play a vital role in coordinating and highlighting the work being done by India in support of UNESCO's objectives. 

The Director General of UNESCO Ms Audrey Azoulay will be visiting India from 4th to 7th of next month.

                Minister of State for HRD Shri Sanjay Dhotre attended the National Inter-School Band Competition today at New Delhi. Shri Dhotre congratulated all the participants and distributed prizes to the winning teams.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Dhotre said that the main purpose of the Inter-school Band Competition is to provide a platform to the students, on which they can display their fine skills and get motivated to grow with a sense of courage, patriotism, and national unity. He also added that a band is much more than a good musical performance. It makes the participants practise fine coordination among themselves and learn a sense of discipline. This acts as a source of energy and motivation not only for them but also for their audience.

16 teams comprising around 400 students who won the Zonal Inter School Band Competitions held in 6 zones across the country and schools from Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan & Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti competed at the National Level Competition held at Thyagaraj Stadium, New Delhi today.

The Department of School Education and Literacy had started the Inter School Band Competition in the year 2017. The competition is organized at three levels viz. State, Zonal and National.  There are separate teams for boys and girls. The winning teams of the 6 zones, one each of boys and girls, compete in the National Level competition. Competitions are held in the KVS and NVS in a similar pattern and 2 winning teams, one boys’ and one girls’ team perform at the National Level event.

The Inter-School Band Competition provides a national platform to the students to display their skills like timing, music, rhythm and synchronization while working together and capturing the essence of ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat’. At the same time they will have an opportunity to showcase their talent before a large audience. This will help inculcate the spirit of patriotism and unity among school students that comes with performing in a band.

This year altogether 402 teams from 30 States and UTs comprising of 10,050 students participated in the State level competition out of which 59 teams made it to the zonal level and 16 teams made it to the national level. The programme also featured a group performance by all the participating students.

The two winning teams one boys’ team and one girls’ team will attend Republic Day Parade function and will also be invited for Raksha Mantri’s function at Republic Day camp.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the Revised Cost Estimates (RCE) for establishment of permanent campuses of new National Institutes of Technology (NITs), at a total cost of Rs.4371.90 crore for the period till 2021 - 2022.

These NITs were established in the year 2009 and started functioning from academic year 2010-2011 in their respective temporary campus with very limited space and infrastructure. The projects at the permanent campus could not be completed in the manner envisaged due to late finalization of land required for construction and also the cost approved for construction works was far below the actual requirements.

With the approved Revised Cost Estimates, these NITs will be fully functional from their respective permanent campuses by 31st March, 2022. The overall student capacity in these campuses will be 6320.

NITs are Institutions of National Importance known to be among the best teaching Institutions in the field of engineering and technology and have made a remarkable presence with their high-quality technical education. These Institutes are capable of producing high quality technical manpower which will fuel entrepreneurship and generation of job opportunities throughout the country.

                Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi interacted with Students from India and abroad in this year’s edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020 held at Talkatora Stadium, New Delhi today. Students were thrilled after receiving valuable tips from the Prime Minister regarding beating stress in every walk of life. 50 Divyang students also took part in the interaction programme. The interaction, which lasted for over ninety minutes, saw students seeking guidance on various issues of importance to them from the Prime Minister. The Ministry of Human Resource Development of Government of India organized the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020 programme. Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, Minister of State for HRD Shri Sanjay Dhotre, Smt. Amit Khare, Secretary, MHRD and senior officials of the ministry were also present on the occasion.

A painting and poster making competition was held on exam related issues for CBSE & KVS school students and around 725 posters and paintings were received. Around 50 paintings were selected and exhibited before the Prime Minister during the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020.

At the outset, the Prime Minister wished all the students a prosperous new year and a new decade. Explaining the importance of the decade, the Prime Minister said that the hopes and aspirations of the current decade rest on those students who are in their final years of schooling in the country.

He said, “In whatever the country does in this decade, those children who are in 10th, 11th and 12th standards now have a very great role to play. To make the country reach new heights, to achieve new hopes, all this is dependent on this new generation”.

Before beginning the interaction, the Prime Minister said notwithstanding that he attends various events and programmes, the one event which is dear to his heart is Pariksha Pe Charcha.

“As Prime Minister one gets to attend numerous types of programmes. You get to learn a lot in such interactions. Each of them provides a new set of experiences. But, if someone asks me about the one programme that touches my heart the most, I would say it is this Pariksha Pe Charcha. I also love attending Hackathons. They showcase the power and talent of India’s youth”, he said.

Dealing with demotivation and mood swings:

Replying to a question from a student about losing interest while studying, the Prime Minister said most often students get demotivated due to factors that are external to them and also as they try to attach too much significance to their own expectations.

Prime Minister asked the students to find out the reason for the demotivation and ponder over how to deal with it. He gave the example of the recent issue of Chandrayaan and his visit to ISRO.

“Motivation, demotivation are very common. Everyone goes through these feelings. In this regard, I can never forget my visit to ISRO during Chandrayaan and the time spent with our hardworking scientists.

He said, “We should not look at failures as setbacks or stumbling blocks. We can add enthusiasm to every aspect of life. A temporary setback doesn’t mean that we cannot succeed in life. In fact a setback may mean that the best is yet to come. We should try to convert our distresssituations as stepping stones for a bright future”

The Prime Minister also gave examples of how cricketers Rahul Dravid and V V S Laxman batted in difficult situations during India – Australia match in 2001 and extracted India out of claws of defeat to clinch victory for the country.

He also talked about how India bowler Anil Kumble bowled to India’s glory notwithstanding his injury.

“This is the power of positive motivation”, he said.

Balancing Extra- Curricular Activities and Studies:

To a question on how to balance studies and extracurricular activities, the Prime Minister said the importance of co-curricular activities in a student’s life cannot be understated.

He said, “Not pursuing extra-curricular activities can make a student like a robot”.

But he also said that balancing studies and extracurricular activities would require a better and optimal time management by the students.

“Today there are plenty of opportunities and I hope youngsters make use of them and pursue a hobby or an activity of their interest with proper zeal”, he said.

However he also cautioned the parents not to make the extra-curricular interests of their children a fashion statement or a calling card.

“What is not good is when the passion of the children become fashion statements for parents. Extra-curricular activities needn’t be glamour driven. Let each child pursue what he or she likes”, he said.

Whether scores are all that matter:

On a question on how to score marks in examinations and whether they are the determining factor, the Prime Minister said, “Our education system determines our success based on our performance in various exams. Even though we focus our attention on scoring good marks and our parents too, exhort us towards it. “

Saying that there are several opportunities today, he asked the students to come out of the feeling that success or failure at exams determines everything.

“Marks are not life. Similarly examination is not the determining factor for our whole life. It is a stepping stone, an important stepping stone in life. I pray to parents not to tell them that this is everything. If it does not happen, don’t behave as if you lost everything. You can go to any field. There are umpteen opportunities”, he said.

Exams are important, but exams are not life. You should come out of this mind-set, he said.

Importance of Technology in Education

To a question on the importance of technology and its use in education, the Prime Minister said, that while the students should keep themselves updated with the latest in technology, the Prime Minister also urged them to be careful of the perils of its misuse.

“Fear of technology is not good. Technology is a friend. Merely knowledge of technology isn’t enough. It’s application is as important. Technology is a part of our daily lives, but if we misuse it, it robs our valuable time and resources”, he said.

Rights Vs Duties

To a question on what are the rights of the students and on how to make the citizens aware of their duties, the Prime Minister said that an individual’s rights are embedded in his duties.

Giving an example of a teacher, he said, if a teacher performs his duties then he is fulfilling the rights of the students.

Referring to what the Father of the Nation opined on the issue, the Prime Minister said, “Mahatma Gandhi said that there are no fundamental rights but fundamental duties”.

“Today, I am talking to students who would be playing a key role in India’s development in 2047, when we mark a hundred years since independence. I hope this generation takes it upon themselves to act on some of the Fundamental Duties enshrined in our Constitution”, he said.

How to deal with pressure and expectations from parents and teachers?

On how to deal with the pressure and expectations from parents and teachers, the Prime Minister urged the parents not pressurize the students but to pursue with them.

“The way ahead lies in pursuing, not pressuring children. Inspire children to do things that bring out their inner potential”

Best time to study and blanking out during the exam and Fear of Board Exams

On a question on what is the best time to study, the Prime Minister advised that ample rest is as important as the study itself.

He said, “While mind is as fresh early in the morning as the sky after rain, one should only follow that routine in which one is comfortable”

On the issue of sudden blanking out during exams, the Prime Minister asked the students to be thorough in their preparation.

“I would urge students to be confident about their own preparation. Do not enter the exam hall with any sort of pressure. Do not worry about what others are doing. Have faith in yourself and focus on what you’ve prepared”, he said.

Future Career Options

On the subject of future career options, the Prime Minister asked the students pursue their heart and work with zeal to deliver for the nation and its development

“Careers are very important, everyone has to take some responsibility. We can always contribute to the nation while delivering our responsibilities”, he said.

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said thatIndia has one of the largest educational systems in the worldwith around 1000 universities, 40000 plus degree colleges, 16 lakh schools, 1 crore teachers, 33 crore students and the Ministry of HRD has taken a number of initiatives to provide holistic and quality education to all the students across the country. He expressed his gratitude to the Prime Minister for taking out time for the students with the view to imbibe self-confidence in the tough days of the examinations and relieve stress in challenging environment.He said that it is a matter of pride that under the leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India's image has enhanced in a big way and now India isproviding leadership to the entire world, whether it is in the field of climate change or solar energy or strengthening of democratic values. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, India is playinga decisive role in raising the voice against terrorism; propagating yoga and establishing peace in the world.

In his welcome address, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’said that the exam time is stressful and difficult for everyone but with determined strength and mental stability, we can face the challenge of examination. The Minister informed that more than 15 crore students from all the States and Union Territories of India;and students, parents, teachers from 25 countries from all over the world are watching this programlive.

                Ministry of HRD and Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs are partnering together  for Online Youth Parliament Programme to commemorate 70 years of Constitution. In this regard a meeting was held in the Ministry of HRD  between Secretary, MHRD Shri Amit Khare; Secretary, M/o Parliamentary Affairs Shri Rajendra S Shukla and CBSE Chairperson, Ms Anita Karwal in New Delhi today. They discussed the modalities to increase the outreach of Youth Parliament Programme run by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs by making it online through the web-portal of National Youth Parliament Scheme. Other senior officers from both the ministries were also present in the meeting. 

In the meeting, Secretary, MPA explained that the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs has been implementing off-line Youth Parliament programme since 1966 in Schools under the Directorate of Education, Government of NCT of Delhi and NDMC, Kendriya Vidyalayas, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas and Universities/ Colleges. Around 18000 students of 300 educational institutions participate through off-line Youth Parliament programme every year. This programme is organized in competition format which is limiting the participation of the institutions and thus not fulfilling the core purpose of the scheme in the desired manner. For overcoming this limitation, which is impeding the expansion of the scheme, this Ministry has developed a Web-Portal of National Youth Parliament Scheme to increase the coverage of the programme manifold to hitherto untouched sections and corners of the country.

National level celebrations focussed on Constitution and Fundamental Duties are being held all over the country to commemorate the Constitution Day and as a part of the celebrations, President has launched the web-portal of National Youth Parliament Scheme on the occasion to commemorate the 70 th Anniversary of adoption of the Constitution of India ‘SamvidhanDiwas’ on 26 th November 2019 in Central Hall, Parliament House, New Delhi.

All recognised schools, colleges and universities can access the portal at www.nyps.mpa.gov.in to take part in the Youth Parliament programme of the Ministry. The last date for the registration on the portal has been extended to 28th February, 2020. The salient features of the web-portal are:-

• All recognised educational institutions of the country are eligible to participate in this programme.

• The registration for participation will be done by the educational institutions through the web-portal.

• E-training modules, videos, photographs and scripts are available on the portal for online self-learning of the participants.

• After successful registration, the educational institutions will be able to conduct youth parliament sittings in their respective institutions.

• Each student taking part in the sitting will get a Digital ‘Certificate of Participation’ and Teachers-in-charge and Head of Institution will get a ‘Certificate of Appreciation’ through the web portal.

The noble ideals and the important role the programme plays in spreading the ideas of democracy in the student community is well realised. Considering the importance of the programme, it is necessary to ensure participation of maximum number of educational institutions in the Youth Parliament Programme through web-portal of National Youth Parliament Scheme. All educational institutions under CBSE and AICTE will be targeted for participation in the programme with an aim of covering lakhs of educational institutions and crores of students every year. M/o HRD will also take up the matter with the various State Governments to ensure maximum participation in the programme.

After discussions, Secretary, D/o Higher Education & School Education & Literacy assured to work in tandem with the M/o Parliamentary Affairs to increase the outreach of the programme as part of celebrations of 70 th anniversary of adoption of constitution and make all efforts to take up the issue with CBSE, UGC, AICTE, KVS, NVS, State Education Secretaries, Central Universities, etc. for participation of maximum educational institutions.

                The fee related matter of JNU has been sorted out following several rounds of discussions with representatives of JNU students and teachers. The Ministry of Human Resource Development under the guidance of Union HRD Minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ took the lead by setting up a High Powered Committee (HPC) after the representatives of agitating JNU students met the HRD Minister who assured to look into the matter. 

The High Powered Committee (HPC) was appointed to restore the normal functioning of JNU through dialogue with all stakeholders and to advise the university administration for resolution of contentious issues. 

Taking into consideration the spirit of recommendations of the HPC various meetings were held by Secretary HRD with representatives of students/teachers and JNU administration on 10th and 11th December, 2019, certain mutually agreeable agreements were arrived. In pursuance of the same, and after rounds of discussions, the JNU has issued a statement that the students are not being asked to bear the cost of service and utility charges proposed for the winter session which was their basic demand. As agreed in the meeting of 10th and 11th December, 2019, the revised hostel room charges however will remain applicable with 50% concession for BPL students. 

Therefore, the JNU fee hike issue stands resolved since this was the main demand of the students. Till now more than five thousand students have already registered for the winter season. 

The Ministry as well as the Union HRD Minister have time and again appealed to the students to call off their agitation since their key demand has been met with. HRD Minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ has said the main demand related to increase in service and utility charges and other related issues have now been settled and continuation of agitation by the students is no longer justified. He also appealed that institutions of higher education should not be converted into a political arena.

If you have the vision, if you have the ambition, if you have the dream and if you have the commitment to concretize, things can happen, he added. 

Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Digital India has to be a transformational programme. We have the challenge to articulate the digital India and Digital India which is designed empower ordinary citizen into the power of technology, he said. Digital India is designed to bridge digital divide of haves and have-nots and Digital India must bring in digital inclusion, he added. 

The Minister for Electronics and IT said that technology should be low cost, developmental and inclusive. He coined a new slogan that Digital India means technology from the Classes to the Technology for the masses. This conclave must find the emerging challenges and also the way out for it, he tasked. 

Saying that more and more rural empowering missions must be thought of as a model of governance, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad said that NIC has helped monitoring the Swachch Bharat Campaign in the country. Technology should be designed to fulfill the aspirations of the people, he added.  

The Minister for Electronics and IT said that financial inclusion is supplementing digital inclusion which is going to be the roadmap of the future of our nation. Digital India should be supplemented by the digital inclusion, he added.

He hoped that a woman in a remote village with a Smartphone in her hand should get the bank in her hand. A good team of women entrepreneurs be formed in every village ranging from financial inclusion skilling, digital inclusion skilling to further empower them, he said. 

Saying that India is waiting for a big revolution of financial inclusion, the Minister for Electronics and IT said that let the digital inclusion and financial inclusion must become the benchmark of India’s transformational governance. 

Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad said that data is going to drive the Technology and governance. We all must understand the impact of data. He narrated five corners for Data – Data Availability, Data Utility, Data Innovation, Data Anonymity and Data Privacy. We need to have these five corners in mind while handling data, he said. India should become a big centre for Data refining process and NIC should work in that direction, he added.

National Informatics Centre (NIC) as a premier technology advisor and ICT solution provider to Government at all levels, has always taken the first step to introduce the latest technologies and services in government, be it the introduction of ICT in Government, establishment of NICNET or National Knowledge Network (NKN), development of critical e-Governance solutions and a host of other services required by the Government.

Blockchain technology is upcoming & niche technology and adoption of the same in sectors such as health, finance, agriculture and various other sectors would aid the government in implementing various programmes and provide trust and immutability to the assets.

The CoE has developed Blockchain based Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for select government use cases to understand potential benefits provided by this emerging technology. New and previously unforeseen applications of Blockchain in the Government are expected to enhance transparency, traceability and trust in e-governance systems.

The Centre of Excellence will facilitate the Government Departments in building proof of concepts for use of Blockchain technology in different dimensions of governance leading to large scale deployment of some such applications. With National Informatics Centre (NIC) providing a robust and an agile infrastructure, the CoE shall also provide Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) for efficient hosting of Blockchain network.

                In a major recognition towards Government of India’s effort towards conservation, restoration and rejuvenation of its wetlands, Ramsar has declared 10 more wetland sites from India as sites of international importance. The Ramsar Convention signed on February 2, 1971, is one of the oldest inter-governmental accord signed by members countries to preserve the ecological character of their wetlands of international importance. 

The aim of the Ramsar list is to develop and maintain an international network of wetlands which are important for the conservation of global biological diversity and for sustaining human life through the maintenance of their ecosystem components, processes and benefits. Wetlands declared as Ramsar sites are protected under strict guidelines of the convention. 

Expressing happiness over the announcement, the Union Environment Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar in a tweet message said that the Ramsar declaration is an acknowledgement of Government of India’s commitment in achieving the conservation and sustainable use of the important wetlands of the country.

 

Happy to inform that #Ramsar has declared 10 more #wetland sites from India as sites of international importance for the conservation of global biological diversity. It is an acknowledgment of India's commitment towards #conservation and #sustainable use of its wetland.@PMOIndia— Prakash Javadekar (@PrakashJavdekar) January 28, 2020 


 

The Union Minister also said that conservation of wetlands would also go a long way in achieving our Prime Minister’s dream of ‘Nal se Jal’ in each household. The government has recently in July launched the new 'Nal se Jal' scheme, which aims to provide piped water connection to every household by 2024.

 

The total number of #Ramsar sites in India are now 37 & the surface area covered by these sites is 1,067,939 hectares. Conservation of #wetlands would also go a long way in achieving our PM @narendramodi ji's dream of #NalseJal in each houseland.@PMOIndia @PIB_India @MIB_India— Prakash Javadekar (@PrakashJavdekar) January 28, 2020 

 

With this, the numbers of Ramsar sites in India are now 37 and the surface area covered by these sites is now 1,067,939 hectares. Maharashtra gets its first Ramsar site (Nandur Madhameshwar) , Punjab which already had 3 Ramsar sites adds 3 more (Keshopur-Miani, Beas Conservation Reserve, Nangal) and UP with 1 Ramsar site has added 6 more (Nawabganj, Parvati Agra, Saman, Samaspur, Sandi and SarsaiNawar).

Wetlands provide a wide range of important resources and ecosystem services such as food, water, fibre, groundwater recharge, water purification, flood moderation, erosion control and climate regulation. They are, in fact, are a major source of water and our main supply of freshwater comes from an array of wetlands which help soak rainfall and recharge groundwater. 

In the past six months, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has prepared a four pronged strategy for the restoration of wetlands which includes preparing a baseline data, wetland health cards, enlisting wetland mitras and preparing targeted Integrated Management Plans. Conservation of wetlands would also go a long way in achieving our PM’s dream of ‘Nal se Jal’ in each household. The Ministry would be working closely with the State Wetland Authorities to ensure wise use of these sites.

                India has successfully achieved the complete phase out of Hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-141 b, which is a chemical used by foam manufacturing enterprises and one of the most potent ozone depleting chemical after Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) .(HCFC)-141 b is used mainly as a blowing agent in the production of rigid polyurethane (PU) foams.

India has consciously chosen a path for environment friendly and energy efficient technologies while phasing out Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs). Importantly, India is one among the few countries globally and a pioneer in some cases in the use of technologies, which are non-Ozone Depleting and have a low Global Warming Potential (GWP).

India had proactively and successfully taken the challenge of complete phase out of Hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-141 b, which is a chemical used by foam manufacturing enterprises by 1.1.2020.  On 31 December, 2019, as part of the Government’s commitment for moving towards environment friendly technologies, in a significant first, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) brought out a notification in the Gazette of India through which the issuance of import license for HCFC-141b is prohibited from 1st January, 2020 under Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2019 issued under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. 

HCFC-141b is not produced in the country and all the domestic requirements are met through imports. With this notification, prohibiting the import of HCFC-141 b, the country has completely phased out the important ozone depleting chemical. Simultaneously, the use of HCFC-141 b by foam manufacturing industry has also been closed as on 1st January, 2020 under the Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2014. 

Nearly, 50 % of the consumption of ozone depleting chemicals in the country was attributable to HCFC-141 b in the foam sector. The Ministry adopted a structured approach to engage with foam manufacturing enterprises for providing technical and financial assistance in order to transition to non-ODS and low GWP technologies under HCFC Phase out Management Plan (HPMP). Around 175 foam manufacturing enterprises have been covered under HPMP out of which, 163 enterprises are covered under stage II of HPMP. The complete phase out of HCFC 141 b from the country in foam sector is among the first at this scale in Article 5 parties (developing countries) under the Montreal Protocol. The implementation of HPMP through regulatory and policy actions, implementation of technology conversion projects has removed around 7800 Metric Tonnes of HCFC 141-b from the baseline level of 2009 and 2010 of the country.  

The phase out of HCFC-141b from the country has twin environmental benefits viz. (i) assisting the healing of the stratospheric ozone layer,and (ii) towards the climate change mitigation due to transitioning of foam manufacturing enterprises at this scale under HPMP to low global warming potential alternative technologies. 

The polyurethane foam sector has links with important economic sectors related to buildings, cold storages and cold chain infrastructure, automobiles, commercial refrigeration, domestic appliances such as refrigerators, water geysers, thermo ware, office and domestic furniture applications, specific high value niche applications etc. In India, the foam manufacturing sector is mix of large, medium and small enterprises having varying capacities, with preponderance of MSMEs. Many of the MSMEs operate largely in the informal sector. 

To ensure minimal dislocation in the sector and for enhancing the capacities of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in converting to low-GWP non-ODS technologies, training and awareness programmes on non ODS and low GWP alternatives to HCFCs including adoption of such alternatives have been organized in close collaboration with Industry and MSMEs will also be facilitated for adequate tie-ups with system houses, laboratories for getting their material tested, etc, in addition to organizing study tours, field visits, etc.

Noting the challenges, the Ozone Cell, MoEF&CC entered into a MOA with the Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology, Department of Chemicals &Petrochemicals to facilitate and hand-holding foam manufacturing enterprises. Transitioning to non HCFC and low GWP alternatives. As part of assistance made available to the enterprises technology workshops, field trials, on-site demonstration and support, practical hands on training and product validation are being provided. Already enterprises assisted for stabilizing alternative technologies have been able to move towards adoption of alternatives at commercial scale.

                The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2019-20 in the Parliament today. The Key Highlights of the Economic Survey 2019-20 are as follows:

 

Wealth Creation: The Invisible Hand Supported by the Hand of Trust

 


	India’s dominance as global economic power for three-fourths of economic history manifests by design.
	Kautilya’s Arthashastra postulates the role of prices in an economy (Spengler, 1971).
	Historically, Indian economy relied on the invisible hand of the market with the support of the hand of trust:
	o Invisible hand of the market reflected in openness in economic transactions.
	o Hand of trust appealed to ethical and philosophical dimensions.
	Post-liberalisation, Indian economy supports both pillars of the economic model advocated in our traditional thinking.
	Survey illustrates enormous benefits accruing from enabling the invisible hand of the market.
	Exponential rise in India’s GDP and GDP per capita post-liberalisation coincides with wealth generation.
	Survey shows that the liberalized sectors grew significantly faster than the closed ones.
	Need for the hand of trust to complement the invisible hand, illustrated by financial sector performance during 2011-13.
	Survey posits that India’s aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy depends critically on:
	o Strengthening the invisible hand of the market.
	o Supporting it with the hand of trust.
	Strengthening the invisible hand by promoting pro-business policies to:
	 Provide equal opportunities for new entrants.
	 Enable fair competition and ease doing business.
	 Eliminate policies unnecessarily undermining markets through government intervention.
	 Enable trade for job creation.
	 Efficiently scale up the banking sector.
	Introducing the idea of trust as a public good, which gets enhanced with greater use.
	Survey suggests that policies must empower transparency and effective enforcement using data and technology.


 

Entrepreneurship and Wealth Creation at the Grassroots

 


	Entrepreneurship as a strategy to fuel productivity growth and wealth creation.
	India ranks third in number of new firms created, as per the World Bank.
	New firm creation in India increased dramatically since 2014:


o 12.2 % cumulative annual growth rate of new firms in the formal sector during 2014-18, compared to 3.8 % during 2006-2014.

o About 1.24 lakh new firms created in 2018, an increase of about 80 % from about 70,000 in 2014.


	Survey examines the content and drivers of entrepreneurial activity at the bottom of the administrative pyramid – over 500 districts in India.
	New firm creation in services is significantly higher than that in manufacturing, infrastructure or agriculture.
	Survey notes that grassroots entrepreneurship is not just driven by necessity.
	A 10 percent increase in registration of new firms in a district yields a 1.8 % increase in Gross Domestic District Product (GDDP).
	Entrepreneurship at district level has a significant impact on wealth creation at the grassroots.
	Birth of new firms in India is heterogeneous and dispersed across districts and sectors.
	Literacy and education in a district foster local entrepreneurship significantly:


o Impact is most pronounced when literacy is above 70 per cent.

o New firm formation is the lowest in eastern India with lowest literacy rate (59.6 % as per 2011 Census).


	Physical infrastructure quality in the district influences new firm creation significantly.
	Ease of Doing Business and flexible labour regulation enable new firm creation, especially in the manufacturing sector.
	Survey suggests enhancing ease of doing business and implementing flexible labour laws can create maximum jobs in districts and thereby in the states.


 

Pro-business versus Pro-markets

 


	Survey says that India’s aspiration of becoming a $5 trillion economy depends critically on:


o Promoting ‘pro-business’ policy that unleashes the power of competitive markets to generate wealth.

o Weaning away from ‘pro-crony’ policy that may favour specific private interests, especially powerful incumbents.


	Viewed from the lens of the Stock market, creative destruction increased significantly post-liberalisation: 


o Before liberalisation, a Sensex firm expected to stay in it for 60 years, which decreased to only 12 years after liberalisation. 

o Every five years, one-third of Sensex firms are churned out, reflecting the continuous influx of new firms, products and technologies into the economy.


	Despite impressive progress in enabling competitive markets, pro-crony policies destroyed value in the economy:


o An equity index of connected firms significantly outperformed market by 7 % a year from 2007 to 2010, reflecting abnormal profits extracted at common citizens’ expense. 

o In contrast, the index underperforms market by 7.5 % from 2011, reflecting inefficiency and value destruction inherent in such firms.


	Pro-crony policies such as discretionary allocation of natural resources till 2011 led to rent-seeking by beneficiaries while competitive allocation of the same post 2014 ended such rent extraction. 
	Similarly crony lending that led to wilful default, wherein promoters collectively siphoned off wealth from banks, led to losses that dwarf subsidies for rural development.


 

Undermining Markets: When Government Intervention Hurts More Than It Helps

 


	Government intervention, though well intended, often ends up undermining the ability of the markets to support wealth creation and leads to outcomes opposite to those intended. 
	Four examples of anachronistic government interventions:



	Essential Commodities Act (ECA), 1955:


o Frequent and unpredictable imposition of blanket stock limits on commodities under ECA distorts:

• The incentives for the creation of storage infrastructure by the private sector. 

• Movement up the agricultural value chain. 

• Development of national market for agricultural commodities.

o Imposition of stock limits on dal in 2006-Q3, sugar in 2009-Q1 and onions in September, 2019 spiked up the volatility of the retail and wholesale prices of onions.

o The Ministry of Consumer Affairs must examine whether the ECA is relevant in today’s India. 

o With raids having abysmally low conviction rate and no impact on prices, the ECA only seems to enable rent-seeking and harassment. 

o Survey suggests there is clear evidence for jettisoning this anachronistic legislation.


	Drug Price Control under ECA:


o The regulation of prices of drugs, through the DPCO 2013, led to increase in the price of the regulated pharmaceutical drug vis-à-vis that of an unregulated but similar drug.

o The increase in prices is greater for more expensive formulations than for cheaper ones and for those sold in hospitals rather than retail shops. 

o These findings reinforce that the outcome is opposite to what DPCO aims to do - making drugs affordable.

o Government, being a huge buyer of drugs, can intervene more effectively to provide affordable drugs by combining all its purchases and exercising its bargaining power. 

o Ministry of Health and Family Welfare must evolve non-distortionary mechanisms that utilise Government’s bargaining power in a transparent manner.


	Government intervention in Grain markets:


o Policies in the food-grain markets led to:

• Emergence of Government as the largest procurer and hoarder of rice and wheat.

• Crowding out of private trade.

• Burgeoning food subsidy burden

• Inefficiencies in the markets, affecting the long run growth of agricultural sector. 

o The food-grains policy needs to be dynamic and allow switching from physical handling and distribution of food-grains to cash transfers/food coupons/smart cards.


	Debt waivers:


o Analysis of debt waivers given by States/Centre:

• Full waiver beneficiaries consume less, save less, invest less and are less productive after the waiver, compared to the partial beneficiaries. 

• Debt waivers disrupt the credit culture. 

• They reduce formal credit flow to the very same farmers, thereby defeating the purpose.


	Survey suggests that:


o Government must systematically examine areas of needless intervention and undermining of markets; but it does not argue that there should be no Government intervention. 

o Instead it suggests that the interventions that were apt in a different economic setting may have lost their relevance in a transformed economy. 

o Eliminating such instances will enable competitive markets spurring investments and economic growth.

 

Creating Jobs and Growth by Specializing in Network Products

 


	Survey says India has unprecedented opportunity to chart a China-like, labour-intensive, export trajectory.
	By integrating “Assemble in India for the world” into Make in India, India can:


o Raise its export market share to about 3.5 % by 2025 and 6 % by 2030.

o Create 4 crore well-paid jobs by 2025 and 8 crore by 2030.


	Exports of network products can provide one-quarter of the increase in value added required for making India a $5 trillion economy by 2025.
	Survey suggests a strategy similar to one used by China to grab this opportunity:


o Specialization at large scale in labour-intensive sectors, especially network products.

o Laser-like focus on enabling assembling operations at mammoth scale in network products.

o Export primarily to markets in rich countries.

o Trade policy must be an enabler.


	Survey analyses the impact of India’s trade agreements on overall trade balance:


o India’s exports increased by 13.4 % for manufactured products and 10.9 % for total merchandise

o Imports increased by 12.7 % for manufactured products and 8.6 per cent for total merchandise. 

o India gained 0.7 % increase in trade surplus per year for manufactured products and 2.3 % per year for total merchandise.

 

Targeting Ease of Doing Business in India


	A jump of 79 positions to 63 in 2019 from 142 in 2014 in World Bank’s Doing Business rankings.
	India still trails in parameters such as Ease of Starting Business, Registering Property, Paying Taxes and Enforcing Contracts.
	Survey has numerous case studies:


o For merchandise exports, the logistics process flow for imports is more efficient than that for exports.

o Electronics exports and imports through Bengaluru airport illustrate how Indian logistical processes can be world class.


	The turnaround time of ships in India has almost halved to 2.48 days in 2018-19 from 4.67 days in 2010-11.
	Suggestions for further Ease of Doing Business:


o Close coordination between the Logistics division of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, Ministry of Shipping and the different port authorities.

o Individual sectors such as tourism or manufacturing require a more targeted approach that maps out the regulatory and process bottlenecks for each segment.

 

Golden jubilee of bank nationalisation: Taking stock

 


	Survey observes 2019 as the golden jubilee year of bank nationalization
	Accomplishments of lakhs of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) employees cherished and an objective assessment of PSBs suggested by the Survey.
	 Since 1969, India’s Banking sector has not developed proportionately to the growth in the size of the economy.
	India has only one bank in the global top 100 – same as countries that are a fraction of its size: Finland (about 1/11th), Denmark (1/8th), etc.
	 A large economy needs an efficient banking sector to support its growth.
	 The onus of supporting the economy falls on the PSBs accounting for 70 % of the market share in Indian banking:


o PSBs are inefficient compared to their peer groups on every performance parameter.

o In 2019, investment for every rupee in PSBs, on average, led to the loss of 23 paise, while in NPBs it led to the gain of 9.6 paise.

o Credit growth in PSBs has been much lower than NPBs for the last several years.

· Solutions to make PSBs more efficient:

o Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for PSBs’ employees

o Representation on boards proportionate to the blocks held by employees to incentivize employees and align their interests with that of all shareholders of banks.

o Creation of a GSTN type entity that will aggregate data from all PSBs and use technologies like big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning in credit decisions for ensuring better screening and monitoring of borrowers, especially the large ones.

Financial Fragility in the NBFC Sector

 


	 Survey investigates the key drivers of Rollover Risk of the shadow banking system in India in light of the current liquidity crunch in the sector.
	 Key drivers of Rollover Risk:


o Asset Liability Management (ALM) Risk.

o Interconnectedness Risk.

o Financial and Operating Resilience of an NBFC.

o Over-dependence on short-term wholesale funding.


	Survey computes a diagnostic (Health Score) by quantifying the Rollover risk for a sample of HFCs and Retail-NBFCs (which are representative of their respective sectors).
	 The analysis of the Health Score has the following findings:


o  The HFC sector exhibited a declining trend post 2014 and overall health of the sector worsened considerably by the end of FY2019.

o The Score of the Retail-NBFC sector was consistently below par for the period 2014 -19.

o Larger Retail-NBFCs had higher Health Scores but among medium and small Retail- NBFCs, the medium size ones had a lower score for the entire period of 2014-19.


	 Survey suggests that the Health Score provides an early warning signal of impending liquidity problems.
	 Equity markets react favourably to increase in Health Score of individual HFCs and Retail-NBFCs.
	 The Survey prescribes this analysis to efficiently allocate liquidity enhancements across firms (with different Health Scores) in the NBFC sector, thereby arresting financial fragility in a capital-efficient manner.


 

Privatization and Wealth Creation

 


	 Survey examines the realized efficiency gains from privatization in the Indian context and bolsters the case for aggressive disinvestment of CPSEs.
	 Strategic disinvestment of Government’s shareholding of 53.29 per cent in HPCL led to an increase of around Rs. 33,000 crore in national wealth.
	 Survey presents an analysis of the before-after performance of 11 CPSEs which underwent strategic disinvestment from 1999-2000 to 2003-04:


o Financial indicators such as net worth, net profit, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) etc of the privatized CPSEs, on an average, have improved significantly.

o Privatized CPSEs have been able to generate more wealth from the same resources.


	 Survey suggests aggressive disinvestment of CPSEs to:


o Bring in higher profitability.

o Promote efficiency.

o Increase competitiveness.

o Promote professionalism.

 

Is India’s GDP Growth Overstated? No!

 


	GDP growth is a critical variable for decision-making by investors and policymakers. Therefore, the recent debate about accuracy of India’s GDP estimation following the revised estimation methodology in 2011 is extremely significant.
	As countries differ in several observed and unobserved ways, cross-country comparisons have to be undertaken by separating the effect of other confounding factors and isolating effect of methodology revision alone on GDP growth estimates.
	Models that incorrectly over-estimate GDP growth by 2.7 % for India post-2011 also misestimate GDP growth over the same period for 51 out of 95 countries in the sample.
	Several advanced economies such as UK, Germany and Singapore have their GDPs misestimated with incompletely specified econometric model.
	Correctly specified models that account for all unobserved differences and differential trends in GDP growth across countries fail to find any misestimating of growth in India or other countries.
	Concerns of a misestimated Indian GDP are unsubstantiated by the data and are thus unfounded. 


 

Thalinomics: The Economics of a Plate of Food in India

Fiscal Developments

 


	Revenue Receipts registered a higher growth during the first eight months of 2019-20, compared to the same period last year, led by considerable growth in Non-Tax revenue.

External Sector

 


	Balance of Payments (BoP): 
	India’s BoP position improved from US$ 412.9 bn of forex reserves in end March, 2019 to US$ 433.7 bn in end September, 2019.
	Current account deficit (CAD) narrowed from 2.1% in 2018-19 to 1.5% of GDP in H1 of 2019-20. 
	Foreign reserves stood at US$ 461.2 bn as on 10th January, 2020.
	Global trade: 
	In sync with an estimated 2.9% growth in global output in 2019, global trade is estimated to grow at 1.0% after having peaked in 2017 at 5.7%. 
	However, it is projected to recover to 2.9% in 2020 with recovery in global economic activity.
	India’s merchandise trade balance improved from 2009-14 to 2014-19, although most of the improvement in the latter period was due to more than 50% decline in crude prices in 2016-17.
	India’s top five trading partners continue to be USA, China, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong. 


 


	Exports:
	 Top export items: Petroleum products, precious stones, drug formulations & biologicals, gold and other precious metals. 
	Largest export destinations in 2019-20 (April-November): United States of America (USA), followed by United Arab Emirates (UAE), China and Hong Kong.
	The merchandise exports to GDP ratio declined, entailing a negative impact on BoP position. 
	Slowdown of world output had an impact on reducing the export to GDP ratio, particularly from 2018-19 to H1 of 2019-20. 
	Growth in Non-POL exports dropped significantly from 2009-14 to 2014-19. 
	Imports:
	 Top import items: Crude petroleum, gold, petroleum products, coal, coke & briquittes. 
	 India’s imports continue to be largest from China, followed by USA, UAE and Saudi Arabia.
	 Merchandise imports to GDP ratio declined for India, entailing a net positive impact on BoP. 
	Large Crude oil imports in the import basket correlates India’s total imports with crude prices. As crude price raises so does the share of crude in total imports, increasing imports to GDP ratio.
	Significant Gold imports also correlate India’s total imports with gold prices. However, share of gold imports in total imports remained the same during 2018-19 and the first half of 2019-20, despite an increase in prices, possibly due to increase in import duty that reduced the import of gold.
	Non-POL-non-gold imports are positively correlated with GDP growth. 
	Non-POL-non-oil imports fell as a proportion to GDP from 2009-14 to 2014-19 when GDP growth accelerated. 
	This may be because of consumption driven growth while investment rate declined, lowering non-POL-non-gold imports. 
	Continuous decline in investment rate decelerated GDP growth, weakened consumption, dampened the investment outlook, which further reduced GDP growth and along with it non-POL-non-gold imports as a proportion of GDP from 2018-19 to H1 of 2019-20.
	Under trade facilitation, India improved its ranking from 143 in 2016 to 68 in 2019 under the indicator, “Trading across Borders”, monitored by World Bank in its Ease of Doing Business Report.

	Net remittances from Indians employed overseas continued to increase, receiving US$ 38.4 billion in H1 of 2019-20 which is more than 50% of the previous year level. 
	External debt:
	Remains low at 20.1% of GDP as at end September, 2019. 
	After significant decline since 2014-15, India’s external liabilities (debt and equity) to GDP increased at the end of June, 2019 primarily by increase in FDI, portfolio flows and external commercial borrowings (ECBs).


Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation 


	Monetary policy:
	Remained accommodative in 2019-20. 
	Repo rate was cut by 110 basis points in four consecutive MPC meetings in the financial year due to slower growth and lower inflation. 
	However, it was kept unchanged in the fifth meeting held in December 2019.
	In 2019-20, liquidity conditions were tight for initial two months; but subsequently it remained comfortable.

Prices and Inflation


	Inflation Trends:

	
		Inflation witnessing moderation since 2014
		Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation increased from 3.7 per cent in 2018-19 (April to December, 2018) to 4.1 per cent in 2019-20 (April to December, 2019).
		WPI inflation fell from 4.7 per cent in 2018-19 (April to December, 2018) to 1.5 per cent during 2019-20 (April to December, 2019). 
	
	
	Drivers of CPI - Combined (C) inflation:
	During 2018-19, the major driver was the miscellaneous group 
	During 2019-20 (April-December), food and beverages was the main contributor. 
	Among food and beverages, inflation in vegetables and pulses was particularly high due to low base effect and production side disruptions like untimely rain.
	Cob-web Phenomenon for Pulses:
	
		Farmers base their sowing decisions on prices witnessed in the previous marketing period. 
		Measures to safeguard farmers like procurement under Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF), Minimum Support Price (MSP) need to be made more effective. 
	
	
	Divergence Between Retail and Wholesale price:
	Observed for essential agricultural commodities in four metropolitan cities of the country from 2014 to 2019.
	Divergence particularly high for vegetables like onion and tomato. This may be due to the presence of intermediaries and high transaction costs.
	Volatility of Prices:


o Volatility of prices for most of the essential food commodities with the exception of some of the pulses has actually come down in the period 2014-19 as compared to the period 2009-14. 

o Lower volatility might indicate the presence of better marketing channels, storage facilities and effective MSP system.


	Regional variations:


o CPI-C inflation has been highly variable across States ranging between (-)0.04 per cent to 8.1 per cent across States/UTs in financial year (FY) 2019-20 (April-December).

Agriculture and Food Management


	Largest Proportion of Indian population depends directly or indirectly on agriculture for employment opportunities as compared to any other sector.
	The share of agriculture and allied sectors in the total Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country has been continuously declining on account of relatively higher growth performance of non-agricultural sectors, a natural outcome of development process.

                With the vision of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in his Independence Day 2019 speech highlighted that only when wealth is created will wealth be distributed. The Economic survey 2019-20, tabled by Union Minister for Finance And Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament today, makes an attempt to craft a framework of policies that can foster wealth creation in India, which in turn, would set the economy firmly on an upward growth trajectory. 

The Survey revolves around the theme of enabling markets, promoting 'pro-business' policies and strengthening 'trust' in the economy. It maintains a balanced optimistic stance and makes an attempt to put to rest any skepticism about the benefits accruing from a market economy, both in economic thinking and policy-making. 

India's Rich Tradition of Wealth Creation

The Survey taps into ancient texts like Kautilys's Arthashastra, Thiruvalluvar's Thirukural and treatise on modern economics like Adam Smith's An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations to emphasize upon the importance of 'Ethical Wealth Creation' as the root of economic activity and key to India becoming a $ 5 trillion economy by 2025. 

Through these ancient texts, the Survey documents that ideas of wealth creation are rooted in India's old and rich tradition. India has been a dominant economic power globally for more than three-fourths of the known economic history. Such dominance manifests by design, not be happenstance, the Survey notes.

The Invisible Hand of the Market

Elaborating on India's historical dominance on the global economy, the Survey lays stress on the  importance of bringing an openness in the market that leads to wealth creation, in turn, boosting the economic activity through increased investment. According to the Survey, this 'Invisible Hand of the Market' supported by the hand of 'Trust' has led to such dominance in the past. The Survey provides contemporary evidence of these two factors coming into play when in the post economic liberalization era, because of the induced creative destruction, Indian economy returned to high growth trajectory. 

The Survey's conceptualization of wealth creation, thus presents a combination of ancient Indian tradition with contemporary evidence and suggests use of FinTech for increasing efficiency of our Public Sector Banks. The Survey cover also conveys a synthesis of the 'Old' and 'New' with the lavender of the new Rs. 100 note coming together with the older one.

 



 

Levers for furthering Wealth Creation

The Survey identifies several levers for furthering Wealth Creation, which are: 


	entrepreneurship at the grassroots as reflected in new firm creation in India's districts; 
	promote 'pro-business' policies that unleash the power of competitive markets to generate wealth as against 'pro-crony' policies that may favour incumbent private interests; 
	eliminate policies that undermine markets through government intervention, even where it is not necessary; 
	integrate 'Assemble in India' into 'Make in India' to focus on labour intensive exports and thereby create jobs at a large scale; 
	efficiently scale up the banking sector to be proportionate to the size of the Indian economy and track the health of the shadow banking sector; 
	use privatization to foster efficiency. The Survey provides careful evidence that India's GDP growth estimates can be trusted.


 

Thalinomics

Finally, the Survey makes an attempt to relate economics to the common person using something that an individual encounters every day - a plate of food i.e a Thali.

                For more than three-fourths of known economic history, India has been the dominant economic power globally. Such dominance manifested by design. During much of India’s economic dominance, the economy relied on the invisible hand of the market for wealth creation with the support of the hand of trust. Specifically, the invisible hand of markets, as reflected in openness in economic transactions, was combined with the hand of trust by appealing to ethical and philosophical dimensions. The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today.

The Survey shows that contemporary evidence following the liberalization of the Indian economy support the economic model advocated in our traditional thinking. The exponential rise in India’s GDP and GDP per capita post liberalization coincides with wealth generation in the stock market. Similarly, the evidence across various sectors of the economy illustrates the enormous benefits that accrue from enabling the invisible hand of the market. Indeed, the Survey shows clearly that sectors that were liberalized grew significantly faster than those that remain closed. The events in the financial sector during 2011-13 and the consequences that followed from the same illustrate the second pillar - the need for the hand of trust to support the invisible hand.



The Survey posits that India’s aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy depends critically on strengthening the invisible hand of markets together with the hand of trust that can support markets. The invisible hand needs to be strengthened by promoting pro-business policies to (i) provide equal opportunities for new entrants, enable fair competition and ease doing business, (ii) eliminate policies that undermine markets through government intervention even where it is not necessary, (iii) enable trade for job creation, and (iv) efficiently scale up the banking sector to be proportionate to the size of the Indian economy. Introducing the idea of “trust as a public good that gets enhanced with greater use”, the Survey suggests that policies must empower transparency and effective enforcement using data and technology to enhance this public good.

As wealth creation happens by design, the overarching theme of Economic survey 2019-20 is wealth creation and the policy choices that enable the same. At its core, policies seek to maximize social welfare under a set of resource constraints. Resource constraints force policymakers to focus on efficiency, which more output to be produced from given resources such as land, human resources and capital or, the same output for less resource use.  

The evidence since 1991 shows that enabling the invisible hand of markets, i.e., increasing economic openness, has a huge impact in enhancing wealth both in the aggregate and within sectors. Government intervention hurts more that it helps in the efficient functioning of markets. For instance, in the pharmaceutical industry, government regulated formulation prices increase more than unregulated formulations. Moreover, the supply of unregulated formulations is more than that of regulated formulations. Government interventions often lead to unintended consequences such as price increases, when compared to markets that are unregulated. 

The ease of doing business has increased substantially in the last five years from reforms that provided greater economic freedom. India made a substantial leap forward in The World Bank’s Doing Business rankings from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2019. The Doing Business 2020 report has recognized India as one of the ten economies that have improved the most. 

Yet the pace reforms in enabling ease of doing business need to be enhanced so that India can be ranked within the top 50 economies on this metric. India continues to trail in parameters such as Ease of Starting Business, Registering Property, Paying Taxes, and Enforcing Contracts. The Surveys identifies the most crucial issues plaguing India’s performance beyond the approach taken by the World Bank’s survey.

The analysis in this chapter reveals that key financial indicators such as net worth, net profit and return on assets of the privatized CPSEs, on an average, have increased significantly in the post-privatization period compared to the peer firms. This improved performance holds true for each CPSE taken individually as well. 

 



 

Wealth creation in the economy must ultimately enhance the livelihood of the common person by providing him/her greater purchasing power to buy goods and services. A plate of nutritious food for the common man- a Thali- is a basic item that every person encounters every day. Therefore, there cannot be a better way to communicate whether or not economic policies make the common man better off that qualifying what he/she pays for a Thali every day. The survey presents evidence that a Thali- a nourishing plate of food has become more affordable for a common man now.

                Affordability of Thalis vis-à-vis a day’s pay of a worker has improved over time, indicating improved welfare of the common person. The Economic Survey 2019-20 presented in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt Nirmala Sitharaman states that affordability of vegetarian Thalis improved 29 per cent from 2006-07 to 2019-20 while that for non-vegetarian Thalis by 18 per cent.

 The conclusion has been drawn on the basis of “Thalinomics: the Economics of a plate of food in India” – an attempt to quantify what a common person pays for a Thali across India. Using the dietary guidelines for Indians, the price of Thalis are constructed. Price data from the Consumer Price Index for industrial workers for around 80 centers in 25 States and UTs from April 2006 to October 2019 has been used for the study. 



The Survey states that across India and also the 4 regions- North, South, East and West- it is found that the absolute prices of a vegetarian Thali have decreased significantly since 2015-16 though the price has increased in 2019.  This is owing to the sharp downward trend in the prices of vegetables and dal in contrast to the previous trend of increasing prices. As a result, an average household of 5 individuals that eats two vegetarian Thalis a day, gained around Rupees 10887, on average per year, while a non-vegetarian household gained Rupees 11787, on averageper year. 

The Survey states that 2015-16 can be considered as a year when there was a shift in the dynamics of Thali prices. Many reform measures were introduced since 2014-15 to enhance the productivity of the agricultural sector as well as efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural markets for better and more transparent price discovery. 

The Economic Survey says that food is not just an end in itself but also an essential ingredient in the growth human capital and therefore important for national wealth creation. “Zero hunger” has been agreed upon by nations of the world as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).

                The Government says that based on first Advance Estimates, India’s GDP growth for 2019-20 would be recorded at 5 per cent. This suggests an uptick in GDP growth in second half of 2019-20. The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today, which states that the deceleration in GDP growth can be understood within the framework of a slowing cycle of growth. The financial sector has acted as a drag on the real sector.

The Survey says that the uptick in second half of 2019-20 would be mainly due to ten positive factors like picking up of NIFTY for the first time this year, an upbeat secondary market, higher FDI flows, build-up of demand pressure, positive outlook for rural consumption, rebound of industrial activity, steady improvement in manufacturing, growth in merchandize exports, higher build-up of foreign exchange reserves and positive growth rate of GST revenue collection. 

The Survey says, on a net assessment of both the downside/upside risks, India’s GDP growth is expected to grow in the range of 6.0 to 6.5 per cent in 2020-21 and it asks the Government to use its strong mandate to deliver expeditiously on reforms, which will enable the economy to strongly rebound in 2020-21.

 

The Survey points out that the year 2019 was a difficult year for the global economy with world output growth estimated to grow at its slowest pace of 2.9 per cent since the global financial crisis of 2009, declining from a subdued 3.6 per cent in 2018 and 3.8 per cent in 2017. Uncertainties, although declining, are still elevated due to protectionist tendencies of China and USA and rising USA-Iran geo-political tensions. Amidst a weak environment for global manufacturing, trade and demand, the Indian economy slowed down with GDP growth moderating to 4.8 per cent in first half of 2019-20, lower than 6.2 per cent in second half of 2018-19. A sharp decline in real fixed investment induced by a sluggish growth of real consumption has weighed down GDP growth from 2nd half of 2018-19 to 1st half of 2019-20. 

Real consumption growth, however, has recovered in Q2 of 2019-20, cushioned by a significant growth in government final consumption. At the same time, India’s external sector gained further stability in 1st half of 2019-20, with a narrowing of Current Account Deficit (CAD) as percentage of GDP from 2.1 in 2018-19 to 1.5 in 1st half of 2019-20, impressive Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), rebounding of portfolio flows and accretion of foreign exchange reserves. Imports have contracted more sharply than exports in 1st half of 2019-20, with easing of crude prices, which has mainly driven the narrowing of CAD. 

On the supply side, agricultural growth, though weak, is moderately higher in 1st half of 2019-20 than in 2nd half of 2018-19. Headline inflation rose from 3.3 per cent in 1st half of 2019-20 to 7.4 per cent in December 2019 on the back of temporary increase in food inflation, which is expected to decline by year end. Rise in CPI-core and WPI inflation in December 2019 suggests building of demand pressure. 

In an attempt to boost demand, 2019-20 has witnessed significant easing of monetary policy with the repo rate having been cut by RBI by 110 basis points. Having duly recognized the financial stresses built up in the economy, the government has taken significant steps this year towards speeding up the insolvency resolution process under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and easing of credit, particularly for the stressed real estate and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) sectors. At the same time, impact of critical measures taken to boost investment, particularly under the National Infrastructure Pipeline, present green shoots for growth in H2 of 2019-20 and 2020-21.

Given India’s record of growth with macroeconomic stability over the last five years (annual average growth rate of 7.5 per cent), the economy is poised for a rebound towards the US$ 5 trillion goal by 2024-25.The net FDI and Net Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in first eight months of 2019-20 stood at US$ 24.4 billion and US$ 12.6 billion respectively, more than the inflows received in the corresponding period 2018-19.

In 1st half of 2019-20, CPI (Headline) inflation was estimated at 3.3 per cent, slightly higher than that in 2nd half of the previous year. There has been a further uptick in headline inflation in the month of December 2019 to 7.35 per cent contributed mainly by supply side factors. The food prices spiked following unseasonable rainfall and a flood-like situation in many parts of the country, which affected agricultural crop production. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation, on the other hand, declined sharply from 3.2 per cent in April 2019 to 2.6 per cent in December 2019, reflecting weakening of demand pressure in the economy.

 

 As per the latest available data on employment, there has been an increase in the share of formal employment, as captured by ‘Regular wage/salaried’, from 17.9 per cent in 2011-12 to 22.8 per cent in 2017-18. This 5 per cent points increase in the share of ‘Regular wage/Salaried’ group has been on account of 5 percentage points decrease in the share of casual workers, which reflects formalization in the economy. As a result, in absolute terms, there was a significant jump of around 2.62 crore new jobs over this period in the usual status category with 1.21 crore in rural areas and 1.39 crore in urban areas. 

In 2019-20, Centre’s fiscal deficit was budgeted at Rs. 7.04 lakh crore (3.3 per cent of GDP), as compared to Rs. 6.49 lakh crore (3.4 per cent of GDP) in 2018-19.  Good and Services Tax (GST) collections, the biggest component of indirect taxes, grew by 4.1 per cent for the Centre during April-November  2019. However, the uptick in growth of cumulative GST collections for the Centre started in October 2019 and has sustained its momentum in November December 2019 as well. 

The growth of  bank credit which was picking up in 1st half of 2018-19, started decelerating in 2nd half of  2018-19 and further in 1st half  of 2019-20.  The deceleration was witnessed across all major segments of non-food credit, save personal loans which continued to grow at a steady and robust pace. The deceleration in credit growth was most in the services sector. Credit growth to industry also witnessed a significant decline in recent months, both for MSME sector as well as large industries. Agriculture and allied activities benefitted from a higher growth of credit. 

Despite muted growth of services exports, the trade balance on the services account continued to be positive in 2019-20. The trade surplus on services account has been estimated at US$ 40.5 billion in 1st half of 2019-20, as compared to US$ 38.9 billion in 2018-19. 

Lower Current Account Deficit (CAD) reflects reduced external indebtedness of the country making domestic economic policy increasingly independent of external influence. The CAD, which was 2.1 per cent of GDP in 2018-19, has improved to 1.5 per cent in H1 of 2019-20 on the back of significant reduction in trade deficit. In the first eight months of 2019-20, both gross and net FDI flows to the country have been more than the flows received in corresponding period of 2018-19. Net FPI inflow in 1st half of 2019-20 was also robust at US$ 7.3 billion as against an outflow of US$ 7.9 billion in 1st  half of 2018-19.

 

The drop in fixed investment by households from 14.3 per cent to 10.5 per cent explains most of the decline in overall fixed investment between2009-14 to 2014-19. Fixed investment in the public sector marginally decreased from 7.2 per cent of GDP to 7.1 per cent during the two periods.However, the stagnation in private corporate investment at approximately 11.5 per cent of GDP between 2011-12 to 2017-18 has a critical role to play in explaining the slowing cycle of growth and, in particular, the recent deceleration of GDP and consumption.

                The Economic Survey 2019-20 says India’s aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy depends critically on promoting “pro-business” policy that unleashes the power of competitive markets to generate wealth, on the one hand, and weaning away from “pro-crony” policy that may favour specific private interests, especially powerful incumbents, on the other hand. The  Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman  tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today. The Survey said that economic events since 1991 provide powerful evidence supporting this crucial distinction.  

     The Survey stated that creative destruction has increased significantly after reform. The liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991 unleashed competitive markets and   enabled the forces of creative destruction, generating benefits that we still witness today. Creative destruction brings new innovations in the market that serve people better than the old technologies they displace.  It brings new firms into the markets, which compete with existing firms and lower prices for consumers.  Using the lens of Indian equity markets as captured in the S&P(Standard &  Poor’s) BSE Sensex, we can clearly see an increase in market dynamism in the pro-business India of the post-liberalization period.  After the market reforms of 1991, Sensex has grown at an accelerating pace. Whereas crossing the first incremental 5000 points took over 13 years and was achieved in 1999, the time taken to achieve each incremental milestone has substantially reduced over the years.  Before liberalisation, a Sensex firm expected to stay in it for 60 years, which decreased to only 12 years after liberalisation. Every five years, one-third of Sensex firms are churned out, reflecting the continuous influx of new firms, products and technologies into the economy.

  The Survey noted that liberalisation caused a spike in the number of firms churned in the years that immediately followed it, but the churn rate did not decline to pre-liberalization level in later years.  New sectors like banks and financials entered the index for the first time, eroding the predominance of the manufacturing sector on the index, placing the services sector on the map for the first time, and reflecting the far-reaching changes that the Indian economy was witnessing in the wake of liberalization.

      According to the Survey, the diversity of sectors in the Sensex steadily increased over time following market reforms.  The number of Sensex firms in manufacturing has reduced while those in services has increased between 1988 and 2019.  Almost 60 per cent of the Indian GDP is attributable to the services.

The Economic Survey 2019-20 observed that  pro-crony policies, in contrast to pro-business ones, erode wealth in the economy as cronyism fosters inefficiencies  by inhibiting the process of creative destruction. The connected firms proxy firms that may benefit from pro-crony policies. Despite impressive progress in enabling competitive markets, pro-crony policies have destroyed value in the economy. For example, an equity index of connected firms significantly outperformed the market by 7 per cent a year from 2007 to 2010, reflecting abnormal profits extracted at common citizens’ expense. In contrast, the index underperforms the market by 7.5 per cent from 2011, reflecting the inefficiency and value destruction inherent in such firms.

The Survey pointed out that discretionary allocation of natural resources by a Committee provides avenues for rent-seeking and firm owners divert their focus towards tunnelling away these rents rather than furthering productive economic activities. Pro-crony policies as reflected in discretionary allocation of natural resources till 2011 led to rent-seeking by beneficiaries while competitive allocation of the same resources post 2014 have put an end to such rent extraction. A shift to market-based allocation of resources takes these avenues away, encourages productive economic activity and generates more wealth.  Similarly, crony lending that led to wilful default, wherein promoters  collectively siphoned off wealth from banks, led to losses that dwarf subsidies directed towards rural development.   Every rupee lent to wilful defaulter constitutes an erosion of wealth. As of 2018, wilful defaulters owed their respective lenders nearly Rs.1.4 lakh crores.    Had the money siphoned away by wilful defaulters stayed in the economy, the resulting wealth would have been equivalent in value to that needed to double the allocation towards health, education  and social protection, double the allocation towards rural development, or triple the allocation towards MGNREGA.

The Survey said that wilful default if, unchecked would increase the cost of borrowing for everyone else, including genuine businesses with profitable investment opportunities before them. Adverse selection may force genuine borrowers to exist the market altogether, leaving only cronies in the market and resulting in a market failure that slows economic growth, employment and wealth creation capacity.

                The Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman presented/tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today.The Surveys says that growth in exports provides a much-needed pathway for job creation in India. For instance, the Survey says, in just the five year period 2001-2006, labour-intensive exports enabled China to create 70 million jobs for workers with primary education.  In India, increased exports explain the conversion of about 8,00,000 jobs from informal to formal between 1999 and 2011, representing 0.8 per cent of the labour force, the Pre-Budget Survey says. 

The Survey suggests that India must focus on a group of industries, referred to as “network products”, where production processes are globally fragmented andcontrolled by leading Multi-National Enterprises (MNEs) within their “producer driven” global production networks.  The Survey notes that China’s remarkable export performance vis-a-vis India is driven primarily by deliberate specialization at large scale in labour–intensive activities, especially “network product”where production occurs across Global Value Chains (GVCs) operated by multi-national corporations.



The Economic Survey advised that by integrating “Assemble in India for the world” into Make in India, India can raise its export market share to about 3.5 per cent by 2025 and 6 per cent by 2030, which is highly feasible. In the process, India would create about 4 crore well-paid jobs by 2025 and about 8 crore by 2030, says the Economic Survey.The Pre-Budget Survey says that the incremental value added in the economy from the target level of exports of network products, which is expected to equal $248 billion in 2025, would make up about one-quarter of the increase required for making India a $5 trillion economy by 2025.

The Survey finds that China-India gap in world market share is almost fully drivenby the effect of specialization. On the other hand, the Survey says, India is clearly catching up with China in terms of diversification across productsand markets, the Survey notes. Overall, high diversification combined with low specialization implies that India is spreading its exports thinly over many products and partners, leading to its lacklustre performance compared to China, the Survey says. According to the Survey, the specialization effect can change over the years, due to changes in the quantity and/or the prices of exported commodities. The Survey suggests, if India wants to become a major exporter, it should specialize more in the areas of its comparative advantage and achieve significant quantity expansion.

The Pre-Budget Survey notes that India’s participation in GVCs has been low compared to the major exporting nations, in East and Southeast Asia.In contrast, China’s export composition shows a strong bias towards traditional labour-intensive industries and labour-intensive stage of production processes within capital-intensive industries (in particular, assembly of electronics and electrical machinery). The Survey further notes that the dominance of capital intensive products in the export basket along with a low level of participation in GVCs have resulted in a disproportionate shift in India’s geographical direction of exports from traditional rich country markets to other destinations.

The Survey observes that driven by the nature of its specialization, India has gained a competitive advantage in relatively low and middle income country markets, but at the cost of losing the much bigger markets in richer countries.  According to Survey, though India can benefit significantly from utilizing the potential opportunities from greater trade with high income markets, this requires a reorientation of our trade specialization towards labour-intensive product lines. This can be achieved both via selective focus on (i) traditional labour-intensive sectors and (ii) increased  participation in GVCs.

The Survey suggests that given India’s comparative advantage in labour-intensive activities and the imperative of creating employment for a growing labour force, there are two groups of industries that hold the greatest potential for export growth and job creation.First, there exists a significant unexploited export potential in India’s traditional unskilled labour-intensive industries such as textiles, clothing footwear and toys. Second, India has huge potential to emerge as a major hub for final assembly in a range of products, referred to as ‘network products’, says the Economic Survey. The Survey says that the policy of focusing on NP can create significant gains both in employment creation and GDP growth. 

According to the Survey, the overall impact on India’s exports to the partners, with which the agreements have been signed, is 13.4% for manufactured products and 10.9 % for total merchandise. The overall impact on imports is found to be lower at 12.7 % for manufactured products and 8.6 % for total merchandise. Therefore, the Survey says, from the perspective of trade balance, India has clearly “gained” in terms of 0.7 % increase in trade surplus per year for manufactured products and of 2.3 % increase in trade surplus per year for total merchandise.

                Public Sector Banks (PSBs) with about 70 per cent of the market share in Indian Banking have an onus of supporting the Indian economy and fostering its economic development. The Economic Survey 2019-20, tabled by the Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, in Parliament today, observes that there is disproportionate dwarfism of the Indian banks when compared to the size of the Indian economy. For India to march in its goal of becoming a $5trillion economy, PSBs – the dominant banks in our banking system – need to become efficient. The economy needs PSBs to perform to their fullest potential and support economic growth rather than pullback lending, which has a detrimental effect on growth and welfare.

The Survey expresses that if Indian banks were proportionately large in relation to the size of the Indian economy, India should have at least six banks in the global top 100 than just the current largest PSB- State Bank of India (SBI)-which is the 55th largest bank globally. 

 



The survey notes that despite nationalisation a significant portion of the poor remained unbanked till 2014. Financial inclusion, in large part, happened in August 2014 through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), the first week of which saw more than 18 million bank accounts – a record in the Guinness Book of World Records. 

Digital Transactions & DBT:

The Economic Survey notes that the growth in digital transactions has been significant. The use of direct benefit transfers has increased exponentially over the last five years, has helped to bring both credit and deposits into the banking system across all geographies (rural, semi-urban, urban and metropolitan). The high elasticities across all geographies clearly demonstrate the opportunity that exists for Indian banks to benefit from the greater use of DBT by the Government. There are possibilities for the Indian banking sector to grow proportionate to the scale of the Indian economy. The new programmes have resulted in a surge of individuals and businesses being brought into the formal economy. Perhaps more important is that the inclusion is backed by state-of-art digital infrastructure that generates and stores an abundance of high quality structured data on the all aspects of the economic lives of firms and individuals. Such data are, of course, the gold mine for economic growth in the 21st century. They offer essentially unlimited and uncharted possibilities, especially for firms and individuals who have been traditionally excluded from the financial system.

Enhancing efficiency of PSBs: the way forward

The Economic Survey also observes that over Rs. 4,30,000 crores of taxpayer money is invested as Government’s equity in PSBs. In 2019, every rupee of taxpayer money is invested in PSBs, on average, lost 23 paise. The state of the banking sector in India, therefore, needs urgent attention.

With the key drivers of India’s growth prospects - a) highly favourable demographics – with 35 per cent of its age; (b) a modern and modernising digital infrastructure that encompasses the “JAM” trinity viz., the PMJDY bank account programme, the Aadhaar unique identification programme, and the mobile phone infrastructure; and (c) a uniform indirect taxation system (GST); India’s growth path depends on how quickly and productively these growth levers are deployed using a well-developed financial system. These growth opportunities position PSBs well to utilise FinTech like Credit analytics using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI-ML).

Creation of FinTech Hub for PSBs: The Public Sector Banking Network (PSBN)

The Survey proposes that PSBs need to embrace FinTech, which is revolutionising the global financial landscape. FinTech has radically changed the way information is processed by banks.  The Economic Survey observs that a large proportion of NPAs of Indian banks, especially PSBs, could have been prevented if data and analytics were employed in corporate lending and that a robust credit analytics platform could have easily picked up and provided warning signals besides curbing double-pledging of collateral.

The survey proposes establishment of a GSTN like entity, called PSBN (PSB Network), to use technology to screen and monitor borrowers comprehensively and at length. Apart from utilising data from all PSBs, which would provide a significant information advantage, PSBN would utilize other Government sources and service providers to develop AI-ML ratings models for corporate. Better decision making on credit underwriting would reduce the burden of NPAs, apart from helping them in fraud prevention. The high operating costs of each PSB would decrease by helping them automate the end-to-end process of lending. PSBs would be able to make quicker decisions, process loan applications faster, and reduce turn-around-times (TAT). 

The survey proposes to enable employees to become owners in the banks and thereby incentivise them to embrace risk-taking and innovation continually, a portion of the government stakes can be transferred to employees exhibiting good performance across all levels of the organisation through Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs). Part-ownership of PSBs by employees will reduce agency problems. Benefits include the possible change of the mind-set that of an employee to that of an owner. Employees can constitute one of the blocks of new owners of PSBs through an employee stock ownership Plan (ESOP) that is conditioned on employee performance. Ownership by motivated, capable employees across all levels in the organisation could give such employees tangible financial rewards for value enhancement, align their incentives with what is beneficial to the PSB, and create a mind-set of enterprise ownership for employees a long-term solution to case for employee stakes in PSBs.

                The Economic Survey 2019-20 has stated that the access to Nutrition and Electricity resulted in higher growth rate in India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and new firm creation in Service Sector is far greater than that in Manufacturing, Infrastructure or Agriculture. The Survey was tabled by the Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, in the Parliament,today. 

Saying that the GDP growth is critical variable for decision-making by investors as well as policymakers, the Economic Survey highlighted the recent debate about whether India’s GDP is correctly estimated following the revision in estimation methodology in 2011 is extremely significant. The Survey carefully examined the evidence, leveraging existing scholarly literature and econometric methods to study whether India’s GDP growth is higher than it would have been and concluded that using careful statistical and econometric analysis, it finds no evidence of miss-estimation of India’s GDP growth.

The Survey highlighted the need to invest in ramping up India’s statistical infrastructure is undoubted. It also said that India has made impressive improvements in several social development indicators. 

The Survey discusses about countries differ in several observed and unobserved ways, cross-country comparisons have to be undertaken with care to separate out the effect of other confounding factors and isolate the effect of the methodology revision alone on GDP growth estimates.  

 



The Survey observed that India has taken several initiatives to foster investment like relaxing FDI norms, cutting corporate taxes, containing inflation, accelerating infrastructure creation, improving ease of doing business or reforming taxation etc. As India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, investors see an unparalleled opportunity here, it said. The level and growth rate of a country’s GDP informs several critical policy initiatives by serving as a barometer of the country’s size and health, it added.   

The Survey critically discussed the micro-level evidence which examined new firm creation in the formal sector across 504 districts in India. The granular evidence shows that a 10 per cent increase in new firm creation increases district-level GDP growth by 108 per cent, it added.

The Economic Survey 2019-20, observes that the Indian economy remains on the path of fiscal consolidation and fiscal prudence amidst weak global growth. Major structural reforms have been undertaken to revive growth in and spur investment. The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman tabled The Economic Survey 2019-20, in Parliament today. 

The Economic Survey states that “The Medium Term Fiscal Policy (MTFP) presented with the Budget 2019-20, pegged the fiscal deficit target for 2019-20 at 3.3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which was further expected to follow a gradual path of reduction and attain the targeted level of 3 per cent of GDP in 2020-21.” The survey also states that MTFP projects “Central Government liabilities will come down to 48.0 per cent of GDP in 2019-20. The declining path of Central government debt was expected to continue with debt reaching 46.2 per cent of GDP and 44.4 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 and 2021-22, respectively.”

 

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES

The Economic Survey highlights the improvement in central government finances over the last several years, with an increase in tax to GDP ratio and reduction in the Primary Deficit as a proportion of GDP. During the first eight months of 2019-20, the Revenue receipts registered growth of 13% in April-November 2019 compared to the same period last year, which was led by considerable growth in Non–Tax revenue. 

Adding further, the Economic Survey notes that during 2019-20 (up to December 2019), the gross GST monthly collections have crossed the Rs. 1 lakh crore mark for a total of five times. Gross GST collections for the centre and the states were at Rs. 8.05 lakh crores in April to November 2019, which is an increase of 3.7 % over the corresponding period last year.

Within direct taxes, personal income tax has grown at 7% while major cut in Corporate Income tax rate aims to attract investment and create employment. Until November 2019, the actual realization of Net Tax Revenue to the Centre has been Rs. 7.51 lakh crore, which is 45.5 per cent of Budget Estimate (BE). Pre Budget Survey states that the actual realization of Non-debt Capital receipts to the centre has been Rs. 0.29 lakh crore which is likely to accelerate with significant pipeline of deals in process.

CAPITAL SPENDING TRIPLES 

The Survey emphasizes on the importance of improving the composition and quality of expenditure while staying within the bounds of fiscal prudence. It says “Budgetary expenditure on subsidies has seen significant moderation through improved targeting.” Also there exists additional headroom for further rationalization of subsidies especially food subsidy. 

According to the Survey, capital spending in 2019-20 BE is estimated to grow by 10% over 2018-19 PA to reach Rs. 3.39 lakh crore. On the expenditure side, total expenditure has increased at a considerable pace during April to November 2019-20 with Capital Expenditure growing at roughly 3 times the growth registered during the same period last year. 

 

GDP TO  DEBT RATIO IMPROVING 

As per the Economic Survey, “The total liabilities of the Central government,  as a ratio of GDP, has been consistently declining, particularly after the enactment of the FRBM Act, 2003.” The Central government total liabilities at the end of March 2019 stood at Rs. 84.7 lakh crore, 90% of which is public debt and is characterized by low currency and interest rate risks. Another salient feature is gradual elongation of   the maturity profile of central government’s debt.

 MORE FUNDS TO STATES

Adding further, the document says, “States have obtained larger fund transfers as well as greater autonomy to utilize funds as per their needs” post Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations. Total transfer to States has risen between 2014-15 and 2018-19 RE by 1.2 % points of GDP. As per budget estimates 2019-20, States tax and non tax revenue is anticipated to grow at lower rate relative to growth displayed in 2018-19 RE. The States however have continued on the path of fiscal consolidation and contained their fiscal deficit within targets set out by FRBM Act. However, sustainability of debt by the States remains a challenge in the backdrop of fiscal constraints due to UDAY Bonds, farm loan waivers and implementation of Pay Commission. 

The Economic survey concludes, with a view that in order to boost sluggish demand and consumer sentiments, counter cyclical fiscal policy may have to be adopted. Revenue buoyancy of GST, rationalization of subsidies and relaxation of fiscal deficit target to spur investment along with sustained structural reforms like ease of GST implementation and lowering of corporate tax, will be the key to revive growth.

                The Economic Survey 2019-20 highlights that The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has improved resolution processes in India compared to the earlier measures. The IBC proceedings take 340 days on an average compared to 4.3 years earlier and resulted in recovery of 42.5% amount involved compared to 14.5% under SARFAESI Act.  The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey in Parliament today. 

The Economic Survey notes that monetary policy has remained accommodative in 2019-20 with a 110 basis points cut from 6.25% in April 2019 to 5.15% in October 2019. The Survey states that, “low inflation and need to strengthen domestic growth by spurring private investment” guided the rate cuts by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of RBI.  

The Survey highlights that personal loans continue to grow at a steady and robust pace in 2019-20 while the overall Bank Credit growth has moderated from 12.9% in April 2019 to 7.1% in December 2019. The Economic Survey observes that Monetary Transmission has been weak, for instance, the Survey notes that Credit Spread i.e. the difference between Repo Rate and the Weighted Average Lending Rate (WALR) is at the highest level this decade. 

Further, the Survey points out that Capital to Risk Weighted Asset Ratio (CRAR) of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) has increased from 14.3% to 15.1% between March and September 2019. Similarly, Return on Assets (RoA) for SCBs recovered from (-) 0.1% to 0.4% during H1 of 2019-20. The Economic Survey finds that Gross Non Performing Advances (GNPA) Ratio of SCBs has remained flat at 9.3% since March 2019 to September 2019. 

Furthermore, the Survey highlights that CRAR of the sector is at 19.5% in September 2019 as against a statutory requirement of 15 % also acknowledges the stress in the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) as GNPA ( Gross Non-Performing Advances)  increased from 6.1% in March 2019 to 6.3% in September 2019.

The Pre-Budget survey observes that Systematic Liquidity has largely been surplus since June 2019 despite some episodes of forex sales in  July and August. The survey notes that first half of 2019-20 witnessed softening of the 10-year benchmark G-Sec yield due to subdued crude oil prices, surplus liquidity and change in monetary policy stance of UD Federal Reserve. The yield went up slightly and remained at 6.8% in December 2019 as MPC kept repo rates unchanged. 

The Survey highlights a 13.2% growth in Reserve Money as in December 2019 whereas Broad Money growth picked up marginally defying the declining trend since 2009. Similarly, the Capital Markets witnessed some green shoots with total Public Issue from Primary Markets increasing by nearly Rs. 30,000 Crores. The total cumulative investments by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) in Indian markets increased by 7.8 % to US $ 259.5 billion as on December 31, 2019. The Survey also points out that India’s benchmark indices Nifty50 and S&P BSE Sensex have reached record highs during 2019-20.

                The Union Minister for Finance &Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today. The FM informed that India has jumped up 79 positions in World Bank’s Doing Business rankings, improving from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2019.  It has progressed on seven out of the 10 parameters. The Goods and Service Tax (GST) and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) top the list of reforms that have propelled India’s rise in rankings. However, it continues to trail in parameters such as Ease of Starting Business (rank 136), Registering Property (rank 154), Paying Taxes (rank 115), and Enforcing Contracts (rank 163).

 

The number of procedures required to set up a business in India, for example, has reduced from 13 to 10 over the past ten years. Today, it takes an average of 18 days to set up a business in India, down from 30 days in 2009. Although, India has significantly reduced the time and cost of starting a business, a lot more  needs to be done. 

 



The services sector too faces many regulatory hurdles even for routine businesses. The bars and restaurants sector is an important source of employment and growth everywhere in the world. It is also a business that, by its nature, faces a high frequency of starting new businesses and shutting old ones.  A survey showed that the number of licenses required to open a restaurant in India are significantly more than elsewhere. 

 

Construction permits 

 

India has considerably improved the process to obtain construction permits over the last five years. Compared to 2014, when it took approximately 186 days and 28.2 per cent of the warehouse cost; in 2019 it takes 98-113.5 days and 2.8-5.4 per cent of the warehouse cost. 

 

Trading across borders

 

While the government has already reduced procedural and documentation requirements considerably, increasing digitalization and seamlessly integrating multiple agencies onto a single digital platform can further reduce these procedural inefficiencies significantly and improve user experience substantially. 

 

The turnaround time of ships in India has been on a continuous decline, almost halving from 4.67 days in 2010-11 to 2.48 days in 2018-19. This shows that achieving significant efficiency gains in the case of sea ports is possible. The simplification of the Ease of Doing Business landscape of individual sectors such as tourism or manufacturing, however, requires a more targeted approach that maps out the regulatory and process bottlenecks for each segment. Once the process map has been done, the correction can be done at the appropriate level of government - central, state or municipal.

 

Setting up and operating services or manufacturing business in India faces a maze of laws, rules and regulations. Many of these are local requirements, such as burdensome documentation for police clearance to open a restaurant. This must be cleaned up and rationalized one segment at a time.Enforcing a contract in India takes on average 1,445 days in India compared to just 216 days in New Zealand, and 496 days in China. Paying taxes takes up more than 250 hours in India compared to 140 hours in New Zealand, 138 in China and 191 in Indonesia. These parameters provide a measure of the scope for improvement.

 

A case study of electronics exports and imports through Bengaluru airport illustrates how Indian logistical processes can be world class.Case studies of merchandise exports found that logistics is inordinately inefficient in Indian sea-ports. The process flow for imports, ironically, is more efficient than that for exports. Although one needs to be careful to directly generalize from specific case studies, it is clear that customs clearance, ground handling and loading in sea ports take days for what can be done in hours.

                The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today.  The Economic Survey gave a detailed analysis of the ways in which India will achieve the goal of becoming a USD five trillion economy.

Industrial sector performance in terms of its contribution in Gross Value Added (GVA) improved in 2018-19 over 2017-18.  However, as per the estimates of Gross Domestic Product by National Statistical Office (NSO), the real GVA of industrial sector grew by 1.6 per cent in first half (H1) (April-September) of 2019-20, as compared to 8.2 per cent in H1 of 2018-19.  The low growth in industrial sector  is primarily due to manufacturing sector which registered a negative growth of 0.2 per cent in 2019-20 H1.

Index of Industrial Production (IIP)

Overall, IIP growth has moderated to 3.8 per cent in 2018-19 compared to 4.4 per cent in 2017-18.  During the current year 2019-20 (April-November), it grew at 0.6 per cent as compared to 5 percent in the corresponding period of previous year.  The moderation in growth is mainly arising from subdued manufacturing activities due to slower credit flow to Medium and Small industries, reduced lending by NBFCs owing to liquidity crunch, tapering of domestic demand for key sectors such as automotive sector, pharmaceuticals, and machinery and equipment, volatility in international crude oil prices, prevailing trade related uncertainties.  Exports of key labour intensive sectors, such as gems and jewellery, basic metals, leather products and textile products under performed during the current financial year.  The growth of capital goods and consumer durables declined by 11.6 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively during the current financial year 2019-20 (April-November).  Consumer durables segment was hit mainly due to lack of demand from the household sector especially in Automobile industry.

The growth of infrastructure/construction goods declined by 2.7 per cent in the current financial year 2019-20 (April-November).  Intermediate goods and consumer non-durable registered positive growth in November 2019, however, primary goods, capital goods, infrastructure/construction goods and consumer durables reported negative growth in November 2019.

Gross Capital Formation in Industrial Sector

Gross Capital Formation (GCF) in industry has registered a rise from (-) 0.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 7.6 per cent in 2017-18 showing upward momentum of investment in industry.  Mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services and construction had registered a growth rate of 7.1 per cent, 8.0 per cent, 6.1 per cent and 8.4 per cent respectively in 2017-18.

Credit Flow to the Industrial Sector

Growth in gross bank credit flow to the industrial sector, on a year on year basis, rose to 2.7 per cent in September 2019 as compared  to 2.3 per cent in September 2018.  Credit flow industries like wood and wood products, all engineering, cement and cement products, construction and infrastructure increased in September 2019 as compared to September 2018.  Credit flow to industries like food processing, chemicals and chemical products, vehicles, vehicles parts and transport equipment registered lower growth in September 2019 as compared to September 2018.

 

Corporate Sector Performance

  The manufacturing sector contracted in Q1 of 2019-20 mainly due to a production slowdown.  Petroleum products, iron and steel, motor vehicles and other transport equipment companies were the major contributors to the slowdown. 

Net profit of corporate sector recovered in Q2 of 2019-20 and was 17.4 per cent.  Sales growth of over 1,700 listed private manufacturing companies contracted by 7.7 per cent in Q2 of 2019-20 after remaining in expansionary zone since Q2 of 2016-17.  The capacity utilization of India’s manufacturing sector remains stable at 73.6 per cent in Q1 of 2019-20 as compared to 73.8 per cent in Q1 of 2018-19. 

Performance of CPSEs

 Of the 348 Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) on 31-03-2019, 249 are in operation, 86 CPSEs are yet to start commercial operations and 13 CPSEs are under closure/liquidation.  Out of 249 operating CPSEs, 178 CPSE showed profit during 2018-19, 70 CPSEs incurred losses during the year and one CPSE has shown neither profit nor loss.

The total profit of the 178 profit making CPSEs was Rs.1.75 lakh crores in 2018-19.  The total loss of the 70 loss making enterprises stood at Rs.31,635 crores during the year.

The contribution of the CPSEs to the Central Exchequer increased by 4.67 per cent to Rs.3.69 lakh crores in 2018-19 as against previous year of Rs.3.52 lakh crores.

Eight Core Industries

Growth of Eight Core industries (Coal, Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Refinery Products, Fertilizers, Steel, Cement and Electricity) stood flat during the current financial year (April-November, 2019).  During the corresponding period of the previous year, these industries grew at 5.1 per cent.  While fertilizers, steel and electricity have seen expansion in their production, production of coal, crude oil, natural gas and refinery products have contracted during the current financial year.  

 



 

Sector wise issues and Initiatives

Steel

            India stood at second position in the production of crude steel.  It is also the third largest consumer of the finished steel after China and USA.   Till October 2019, crude steel production was 64.3 MT, showing a growth of 1.5 per cent over corresponding period of last year with utilization capacity of 77.4 per cent.  Production of finished steel was 137.2 MT in 2018-19 and 59.73 MT during April to October 2019.

Coal

Overall production of raw coal in India during 2018-19 was 730.4 MT displaying a growth of 8.1 per cent.

Textile and Apparels

Textile contributed 18.0 per cent of manufacturing and 2.0 per cent of GDP in 2017-18.  The share of textiles and clothing in India’s total export was 12 per cent in 2018-19.   It employs 4.5 crore people directly and 6 crore people in allied sector.  Exports of textile and clothing products including handicraft from India have increased to USD 40.4 billion in 2018-19 from USD 39.2 billion in 2017-18.

In a fast moving world India has to develop its industry and enlarge the scope for Industry 4.0.  that will encompass automation in industrial sectors. The Economic Survey 2019-20 shows the way that will clear the decks which are obstructing the way forward.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today. The Survey affirms that disinvestment improves firm performance and overall productivity, and unlock their potential to create wealth. This would have a multiplier effect on other sectors of the economy. Aggressive disinvestment, preferably through the route of strategic sale, should be utilized to bring in higher profitability, promote efficiency, increase competitiveness and to promote professionalism in management in CPSEs, the Survey advocates. 

The Survey observes that the focus of the strategic disinvestment needs to be to exit from non-strategic business and directed towards optimizing economic potential of these CPSEs. This would, in turn, unlock capital for use elsewhere, especially in public infrastructure like roads, power, transmission lines, sewage systems, irrigation systems, railways and urban infrastructure. It is encouraging that the enabling provisions by Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) are already in place.

According to the Survey the Cabinet has ‘in-principle’ approved the disinvestment in various CPSEs. These need to be taken up aggressively to facilitate creation of fiscal space and improve the efficient allocation of public resources.  

The Survey notes that there are about 264 CPSEs under 38 different Ministries/Departments. Of these, 13 Ministries/Departments have around 10 CPSEs each under its jurisdiction. It is evident that many of the CPSEs are profitable. However, CPSEs have generally underperformed the market as is evident from the average return of only 4 percent of BSE CPSE Index against the 38 percent return of BSE SENSEX during the period 2014-2019. The aim of any privatization or disinvestment programme should, therefore, be the maximisation of the Government’s equity stake value. 

The Survey suggests that the Government can transfer its stake in the listed CPSEs to a separate corporate entity. This entity would be managed by an independent board and would be mandated to divest the Government stake in these CPSEs over a period of time. This will land professionalism and autonomy to the disinvestment programme which, in turn, would improve the economic performance of the CPSEs.

The Survey says that in November, 2019, India launched its biggest privatization drive in more than a decade. An “in-principle” approval was accorded to reduce Government of India’s paid-up share capital below 51 percent in select Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). To examine the efficiency gains from privatization and whether the purported benefits of privatization have indeed manifested in the Indian context, the Survey analyses the before-after performance of 11 CPSEs that had undergone strategic disinvestment from1999-2000 to 2003-04. 

The Survey also examines the change in performance for each individual CPSE. It studied the movement in major financial indicators for each of the firm ten years before and after the year of strategic disinvestment/privatization. Taken individually, each privatized CPSE witnessed improvement in net worth, net profit, gross revenue, net profit margin, sales growth in the post privatization period compared to pre privatization period (except for Hindustan Teleprinters, MFIL and Tata Communications in the case of few indicators).

                Inflation has been witnessing moderation since 2014 in India. The Economic Survey 2019-20 presented in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt Nirmala Sitharaman states that recently inflation hashowever shown an uptick. Headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has increased from 3.7 per cent in 2018-19 (April to December 2018) to 4.1 per cent in 2019-20 for the corresponding period. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation has seen an increase between 2015-16 and 2018-19. It however fell from 4.7 per cent in 2018-19 (April to December 2018) to 1.5 per cent during 2019-20 in the same period. 

 



 

The Survey notes that during 2018-19, the major driver of CPI-Combined inflation was the miscellaneous group. However, during 209-20 (April –December), food and beverages emerged as the main contributor to CPI-C inflation. Among food and beverages, inflation in vegetables and pulses was particularly very high, mainly driven by low base effect and production side disruptions due to untimely rain. The Survey recommends that measures to safeguard farmers like procurement under Price, Stabilization, Fund, Minimum Support Price (MSP) needs to be made more effective.

The Survey notes a divergence between the retail and wholesale price of various essential agricultural commodities in the four metropolitan cities of the country over the period 2014 to 2019. The divergence was particularly high for vegetables like onion and tomato. This could be due to the presence of intermediaries and high transaction costs. 

The Economic Survey says that over time, there has been shift in volatility of prices of essential commodities. Volatility of prices for most of the essential food commodities with the exception of some of the pulses has actually come down in the period 2014-19 as compared to the period 2009-14. This might indicate towards the presence of better marketing channels, storage facilities and effective MSP system for most of the essential agri commodities.

According to the Survey, CPI-C inflation has continued to be highly variable across States. Inflation ranged between (-) 0.04 per cent to 8.1 per cent across States/UTs in Financial year (FY) 2019-20 (April-December). Inflation in fifteen States/Union Territories (UTs) was below 4 per cent in FY 2019-20 (April-December).In all States, there was a divergence between rural and urban inflation. In most of the States the CPI-C inflation in rural areas is lower than the CPI-C inflation in urban areas and this divergence in rural urban inflation was observed across all components food and beverages, clothing and footwear, miscellaneous etc. 

Analysing the variability of inflation in rural and urban areas, the Economic Survey observes that rural inflation has been more variable across States than urban inflation. It also states that there has been a change in the inflation dynamics,as there is convergence of headline inflation towards core inflation.The Survey suggests that this may have implications for the response of monetary policy to food and fuel price shocks: monetary policy need not become tighter in face of short-term, transitory price shocks in non-core components. However, owning to the large weightage of food and fuel in the consumption basket of consumers in India and the fact that demand-side pressures (and not just supply side factors) are important for food and fuel inflation focus on headline inflation for monetary policy decisions may be warranted.

The Economic Survey states that the Government takes various measures from time to time to stabilize prices of essential food items which include utilizing trade and fiscal policy instruments, minimum export price, export restrictions, imposition of stock limits. On the issue of onion prices it says that this went up during 2019-20 starting from August, 2019 and various measures were taken by the Government to ease the situation.

                The Union Minister for Finance &Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today. The Survey stated thatas per World Bank’s Data on Entrepreneurship, it is seen  that India ranks third in number of new firms created. The same data shows that new firm creation has gone up dramatically in India since 2014. While the number of new firms in the formal sector grew at a cumulative annual growth rate of 3.8 per cent from 2006-2014, the growth rate from 2014 to 2018 has been 12.2 per cent. As a result, from about 70,000 new firms created in 2014, the number has grown by about 80 per cent to about 1,24,000 new firms in 2018.

The Survey noted that reflecting India’s new economic structure, i.e. comparative advantage in the Services sector, new firm creation in services is significantly higher than that in manufacturing, infrastructure or agriculture.Entrepreneurial activityin the services sector is highest  in Delhi, Mizoram, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Andaman & NicobarIslandsand Haryana.

The Survey observed that the birth of new firms is very heterogeneous across Indian districts and sectors. Moreover, it is dispersed across India and is not restricted to just a few cities. The literacy and education in the district foster local entrepreneurship significantly. For instance, the eastern part of India has the lowest literacy rate of about 59.6 per cent according to the census of 2011. This is also the region in which new firm formation is the lowest. In fact, the impact of literacy on entrepreneurship is most pronounced when it is above 70 per cent, the Survey says. 

The Survey points out that the level of local education and quality of physical infrastructure in the district influence new firm creation significantly. The grassroots entrepreneurship is not just driven by necessity as a 10 percent increase in registration of new firms in a district yields a 1.8 percent increase in GDDP (Gross District Development Product). Thus, entrepreneurship at the bottom of the administrative pyramid- a district – a significant impact on wealth creation at the grassroots level. This impact of entrepreneurial activity on GDDP is maximal for the manufacturing and services sectors.

The Survey further notes that despite being the 3rd largest ecosystem for entrepreneurship in the world, India appears to have lower rates of formal entrepreneurship on a per-capita basis when compared to other countries.

The Survey points out that relative to entrepreneurial capabilities in manufacturing, Services and Infrastructure, entrepreneurial capabilities in the Agriculture sector seem to be distributed evenly across most districts in India. States in the highest quintile of relative entrepreneurial activity in the Agriculture sector are Manipur, Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Tripura and Orissa. Establishments in the North-East are more likely to be private enterprises in the food business such as organic produce farms and tea plantations while a majority of the establishments in Madhya Pradesh and Orissa are farmer producer companies, designed as hybrids between cooperative societies and private limited companies that organize farmers into a collective to improve their bargaining strength in markets. 



The Survey notes that the entrepreneurial activity in the Manufacturing sector is highest in the regions of Gujarat, Meghalaya, Puducherry, Punjab and Rajasthan. Within Gujarat, the most entrepreneurially active districts in Manufacturing sector are Surendranagar, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Surat. Establishments in these regions are focused on textiles, chemicals, metals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals manufacturing. 

Measures to increase the literacy levels rapidly through the institution of more schools and colleges will spur entrepreneurship and consequently local wealth creation. Thebetter connectivity of villages through tar roads will likely improve access to local markets and improve entrepreneurial activity. The policies that foster ease of doing business and flexible labour regulations foster entrepreneurial activity, especially in the manufacturing sector. As the manufacturing sector has the potential to create the maximum jobs, states must focus on enabling ease of doing business and flexible labour regulations to foster job creation, says the Economic Survey.

                The Economic Survey 2019-20 expressed satisfaction that India’s external sector has gained further stability in the first half of 2019-20, with an improvement in Balance of Payments (BoP) position, anchored by capital flows through FDI, FPI and ECBs; receipt of robust remittances and contraction of CAD.The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today.

The Balance of Payments position improved to USD 433.7 billion by September, 2019 from USD 412.9 billion of forex reserves in March, 2019. This is on the back of Current Account Deficit (CAD) narrowing further to 1.5 per cent of GDP in the first half of 2019-20 from 2.1 per cent in 2018-19. Net FDI inflows remained buoyant attracting USD 24.4 billion in the first eight months of 2019-20, much higher than the corresponding period of 2018-19. Net overseas remittances in the first half of 2019-20 were more than 50 per cent of total receivables in 2018-19, standing at USD 38.4 billion. As per World Bank report of 2019, India’s 17.5 million diaspora made it the top remittance-recipient country in 2018.

India’s foreign reserves are comfortably placed at USD 461.2 billion as on 10th January, 2020. Further, External Debt levels remained low at 20.1 per cent of GDP by the end of September 2019.  India’s external debt liabilities to GDP, including debt and equity components, has increased at the end of June 2019, primarily driven by increase in FDI, portfolio flows and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). 

Composition of Trade

The Survey noted that India’s merchandise trade balance improved from 2009-14 to 2014-19 on the back of decline in crude prices. The merchandise Exports-to-GDP ratio declined to 11.3 per cent, due to weakened global demand and heightened trade tensions over 2018-19 to H1 of 2019-20.Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL), precious stones, drug formulations & biologicals, gold and other precious metals continue to be the top exported commodities; the largest export destinations being United States of America (USA), followed by United Arab Emirates (UAE), China and Hong Kong.



The merchandise Imports-to-GDP ratio also declined, entailing a net positive impact on the BoP position. This is because of the large presence of crude oil in the import basket. Share of gold imports, another important component of import basket, has remained stable in spite of rise in gold prices. Crude petroleum, gold, petroleum products, coal, coke &briquittes constitute top import items. India’s imports continue to be largest from China, followed by USA, UAE and Saudi Arabia in that order.

The Economic Survey 2019-20 further observes that non-POL-non-gold imports are understood to be positively correlated with GDP growth. However, non-POL-non-oil imports fell as a proportion to GDP from 2009-14 to 2014-19 when GDP growth accelerated. This may have happened because of consumption driven growth while the investment rate declined. Continuous decline in investment rate decelerated GDP growth, weakened consumption, dampened the investment outlook; which further reduced GDP growth and along with it, non-POL-non-gold imports as a proportion of GDP from 2018-19 to H1 of 2019-20.

Global Economic Environment

In sync with an estimated 2.9 percent growth in global output in 2019, global trade is estimated to grow at 1.0 percent after having peaked in 2017 at 5.7 percent. The slowdown in world trade reflects a confluence of factors, including a slowdown in investment, reduced spending on capital goods and decline in trade of cars and car parts. The Survey adds that global trade is projected to recover to 2.9 percent in 2020, with recovery in global economic activity, although the future is ridden with uncertainties over trade tensions and change in global value chain structures.


Trade Facilitation

Under trade facilitation, India has improved its ranking from 143 in 2016 to 68 in 2019 under the indicator, “Trading across Borders”, monitored by World Bank in determining the overall ranking of around 190 countries in its Ease of Doing Business Report.In a recently released UN Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade Facilitation 2019, India not only improved its overall trade facilitation score from 69 per cent to 80 per cent but also outperformed other countries in the Asia-Pacific and South and South-West Asia region. The Survey highlighted schemes like Direct Port Delivery (DPD) for imports and Direct Port Entry(DPE) for exports to encourage faster clearances, ‘e-Sanchit’ for lodging supporting documents online, apart from the next-generation software for Indian Customs - “Turant”.

 

Trade Logistics

The logistics industry of India is a sunshine sector, currently estimated to be around US$ 160 billion and shortly expected to touch US$ 215 billion. According to World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, India ranks 44th in 2018 globally, up from 54th rank in 2014.The Economic Survey observed that driving down logistics cost from estimated current levels of 13-14 per cent of GDP to 10 per cent in line with global standards is the next step forward, for which interventions like Fast-tag, Bharatmala, Sagarmala and Dedicated Freight Corridors will be a huge boost.

A new diagnostic Health Score developed for the Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) and Housing Finance Company (HFC) sectors can help detect early warning signals of impending liquidity problems facing the companies in this sector. Using a novel scoring methodology, quantifiable Rollover risk is calculated for the HFCs and the retail NBFCs. The Economic Survey 2019-20 presented by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today gives a detailed analysis of this new methodology including its reliability in predicting financial health of NBFC and HFC firms. The Health Score can be used as a valuable tool to introduce corrective measures to address unfavourablefinancial trends in a timely manner, says the Pre-Budget survey.

 

            Quoting the recent example of defaults on loan obligation by two subsidiaries of IL&FS and DHFL, the Economic Survey brings out the cascading adverse effect of NBFC defaults on the economy. The defaults by these two companies resulted in a chain reaction adversely affecting the market price of their Commercial Papers, panic sale by investors in debt mutual funds, steep decline in net asset value of these debt funds by 53% and a sharp decline in the equity prices of stressed NBFCs causing huge losses of Rs.4000 crores to NBFCs. This took a toll on the overall credit growth in the Indian Economy, and in turn, caused a decline in GDP growth. 

 

HEALTH SCORE: Recent trends for NBFCs/HFCs

            The Health Score is based on the Rollover risk which includes Asset Liquidity Management risk, interconnectedness risk and Financial and Operating Resilience of an NBFC.

The Economic Survey analysis shows that the Health Score for the HFC sector exhibited a declining trend post 2014. By the end of FY2019, the health of the overall sector had worsened considerably. Similarly, the Health Score of the Retail-NBFC sector was consistently below par for the period 2014 till 2019.         Larger Retail-NBFCs had higher Health Scores but among medium and small Retail NBFCs, the medium size ones had a lower Health Score for the entire period from March 2014 till March 2019.

            The above findings suggest that the Health Score provides an early warning signal of impending liquidity problems.The analysis also finds significant evidence that equity markets react favourably to increase in Health Score of individual HFCs and Retail-NBFCs, thereby confirming the validity of Health Score as an early warning signal.

 

Uses of Health Score:

The Pre-Budget Survey observes that this novel Health Score can be of immense use to policy makers with respect to the shadow banking channel of growth. 

Health Score can serve the critical role of predicting refinancing related stress faced by the financial firms in advance. It can serve as an important monitoring mechanism to prevent such problems in future. Furthermore, disaggregating the components and examining their trends can shed light on how to regulate NBFCs.

Other than its utility as a leading indicator of stress in the NBFC sector, the Health Score can also be used by policy makers to allocate scarce capital to stressed NBFCs in an optimal way to alleviate a liquidity crisis.

As per the Survey, the Health Score can also be used to set prudential thresholds on the extent of wholesale funding that can be permitted for firms in the shadow banking system. Regulators can use the Health Score as a basis for optimally directing capital infusions to deserving NBFCs to ensure efficient allocation of scarce capital.

                Growing in its significance, the Services Sector accounted for about 55percent of the economy and Gross Value Added (GVA) growth, two-thirds of total FDI inflows into India and about 38percent of the total exports. This was emphasized by the Economic Survey 2019-20, tabled in the Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman. The sector’s share now exceeds 50 per cent of the Gross State Value Added in 15 out of the 33 states and UTs, the Survey further noted.

The Survey added that the services sector saw a 33 per cent jump in the gross FDI equity inflows during April – September 2019, touching US$ 17.58 billion. This was driven by strong inflows into sub-sectors such as Information & Broadcasting, Air Transport, Telecommunications, Consultancy Services and Hotel & Tourism, the Survey observed.

The Survey underscored that services exports have outperformed goods exports in the recent years, due to which India’s share in world’s commercial services exports has risen steadily over the past decade to reach 3.5 per centin 2018, twice the share in world’s merchandise exports at 1.7 percent.

The Pre-Budget Survey also observed that various high-frequency indicators and sectoral data such as air passenger traffic, rail freight traffic, port and shipping freight traffic, bank credit, IT-BPM (Business Process Management) sector revenues, foreign tourist arrivals and tourism foreign exchange earnings suggest a moderation in services sector activity during 2019-20. However, on the bright side, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into services sector has witnessed a recovery in early 2019-20 and services exports have maintained their momentum during April-September 2019, the Survey suggests.



From a long term-perspective, the Survey advises that focusing on boosting service exports during bilateral trade negotiations augurs well for India in mitigating bilateral trade deficits with trading partners. 

Within the services sector, the Survey highlightedkey developments within some sub-sectors: 


	Tourism Services: The sector is a major engine of growth, contributing to GDP, foreign exchange earnings and employment. However, growth in foreign exchange earnings slowed in 2018 and 2019, in line with global trends. But with the liberalization of the visa regime with the e-Visa scheme, available for 169 countries, foreign tourist arrivals to India on e-visas have increased from 4.45 lakh in 2015 to 23.69 lakh in 2018 and stood at 21.75 lakh in January-October 2019, recording nearly 21 per cent year-on-year growth.
	 
	IT-BPM Services: The Indian IT-BPM Industry has been the flag-bearer of India’s exports for the past two decades, with industry size reaching about US$ 177 billion in March 2019. The sector contributes significantly to the economy via employment growth and value addition. A number of policy initiatives have been taken to drive innovation and technology adoption in the IT-BPM sector, including Start-up India, National Software Product Policy and removal of issues related to Angel Tax. The Indian start-up ecosystem has been progressing and is now the third largest in the world with 24 unicorns.
	 
	Port and Shipping Services: The turnaround time of ships, which is a key indicator of efficiency of the ports sector, has been on a continuous decline, almost halving between 2010-11 and 2018-19, from 4.67 days to 2.48 days.
	 


· Space Sector: India’s space programme has grown exponentially since its modest beginnings five decades ago, moving from simple mapping services to many more uses currently. Even though India’s spending is less compared to others, ISRO has launched around 5-7 satellites per year in recent years with almost no failures.

                Emphasizing India’s Holistic approach towards tackling the issues of climate change with focus on developmental imperatives, the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today. 

The Survey states that India has strived to ensure that it follows a growth path that delivers Sustainable development and protects the environment by investing in various schemes aligned with its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under Paris Agreement in accordance with principles of equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities.

The Economic Survey further observed that India’s mitigation strategies have emphasized on clean and efficient energy system, enhanced energy efficiency, resilient urban infrastructure, safe, smart and sustainable green transportation network, planned afforestation as well as holistic participation across all sectors.

Progress in India’s Policies for Sustainable Development and Climate change 

The Economic Survey observes that India is on track to achieve its NDCs. The Survey further highlights the significant leap in India’s renewable energy sector i.e. 83 GW targets being achieved out of aimed target of 175 GW Renewable Energy under one of the World’s largest Renewable Energy expansion programs. 

Further, Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) was launched in 2014 with twin objectives of ensuring 100 percent scientific solid waste management and making urban India ODF to achieve total environmental improvement. All Urban areas of 35 States/UTs have become ODF and percentage of waste processing rose from around 18 percent to 60 percent.

The Economic Survey highlights India’s decision to revise the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in line with NDCs to make it more comprehensive. The Survey also lauded the performance of Schemes like UJALA for LED bulb distribution which crossed 360 million, street Lighting programme under which 10 million conventional streetlights were replaced by LED streetlights resulting in saving 43 million tons of CO2 emission.

India’s Initiative at the International Stage

In the Solar Sector, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) has taken up the role of ‘Enabler’ by institutionalizing 30 fellowships from the member countries; of ‘Facilitator’ by getting the lines of credit worth US$2 billion from EXIM Bank of India and US$1.5 billion from Agence Francaise de Development (AFD), France; of an ‘Incubator’ by nurturing initiatives like the Solar Risk Mitigation Initiative  and of an “Accelerator’ by developing tools to aggregate demand for 1000 MW solar and 2,70,000 solar pumps.

India recently launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) on sidelines of UN Secretary General’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019. CDRI aims to promote resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and Disaster Risks to reduce the infrastructure losses from Disasters.

India recently hosted the 14th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 14) to the United Nations convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) from 2-13 September 2019. The New Delhi declaration: Investing in Land and Unlocking Opportunities was adopted in the COP 14. India also announced support for enhanced South-South cooperation. Global Water Action Agenda for land water management was also launched. 

India’s efforts towards aligning Financial System with Sustainability

The Survey observed that India has the Second largest Emerging Green Bond Market after China. The SBI entered the market with an US$650 million Certified Climate Bond. India also joined International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF) in 2019 to scale up the environmentally sustainable investments.

The Survey also expressed concern over crunch issue in climate finance .Green Climate Funds’ first replenishment (2020-2023) so far witnessed 28 countries pledging resources to replenish the fund for an amount of US$9.7 billion which is quantitatively lower than the Initial Resource Mobilization (IRM) period. The Survey further expressed a hope that India will continue to do its fair share of responsibilities while strongly calling for developed countries to take the lead.

                Emphasizing the idea that wealth creation should do no harm, the Economic Survey 2019-20 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, highlighted several ideas on the themes of Sustainable Development and Climate Change. The survey affirmedthat the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) constitute a befitting framework to answer the developmental challenges to achieve a sustainable future, free from social, economic, and environmental inequalities and thereby ensuring a greener and healthy planet for future generations.

Sustainable Development Goals

As per the Survey, India is striving to combine the element of ‘sustainability’ to its economic development through well designed initiatives for inclusive development enshrined in its policies like electrification of rural households, augmenting usage of renewable sources, eliminating malnutrition, eradicating poverty, increasing access to primary education to all girls, providing sanitation and housing for all, equipping young people with skills to compete in the global labour market, enabling access to finance and financial services.

India and the SDGs

The Survey underscored the fact that India has achieved considerable progress in the field of SDGs as measured by the SDG India Index 2019.  As per the SDG Index, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Goa, Sikkim, Chandigarh and Puducherry are the front runners. It is noteworthy that none of the States/UTs fall in the Aspirant category in 2019. Overall, it is encouraging to note that the composite score for India in the index has improved from 57 in 2018 to 60 in 2019, indicating the impressive progress made by the country in its journey towards achieving the SDGs.

 

 

SDG Nexus: A New Paradigm Approach

The Survey further highlighted that there are linkages among various SDGs and these have strong impacts on reinforcement of policies. This necessitates a ‘nexus’ approach which in turn employs the principles of integrating management and governance across sectors and scales. As per the Survey this envisages looking at systems instead of individual components or short-term outcomes; looking at the inter-related feedbacks from other sectors; and promoting cooperation among sectors while reducing competition for scarce resources.

An example of such a nexus wouldbe the Education and Electricity nexus wherein it has been observed that basic infrastructure like electricity, separate toilets for girls and boys in schools create a healthy and positive environment at schools. Another such nexus would be between Health and Energy, wherein the success of many of the health improvement schemes relies heavily on the availability of electricity at the health centers, the Survey states.

India and its Forests

The Economic survey underlined that as a responsible nation, with the introduction of various schemes, India has been continuously moving towards economic growth, keeping in mind the imperatives of sustainable development.It further highlighted the fact that India is among a few countries in the world where, despite ongoing developmental efforts, forest and tree cover are increasing considerably. The forest and tree cover have reached 80.73 million hectare which is 24.56 per cent of the geographical area of the country. The Survey further highlighted that the States/UTs showing gain in forest cover are Karnataka (1,025 sq. km), Andhra Pradesh (990 sq. km) and Jammu & Kashmir (371 sq. km) whereas those showing loss in forest cover include Manipur, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram.In the Forest Report 2019, the total carbon stock in forest is estimated as 7,124.6 million tons,showing an increase of 42.6 million tons as compared to the last assessment in 2017.

Agricultural Residue Burning – A Major Concern

The Survey recognizes the fact that open burning of crop residues in the agricultural fields has become a major environmental concern. India, being the second largest agro-based economy with year-round crop cultivation, generates a large amount of agricultural waste, including crop residues. Varieties of surplus crop residues are burnt especially in northern States of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan. The Survey said that about 178 million tonnes of surplus crop residues are available in the country, burning of which leads to rise in pollutant levels and deterioration of air quality.

The Survey emphasizes that agricultural residue burning contributes significantly in PM2.5 concentrations. The effect of stagnant atmospheric condition over Delhi during the harvest season of Kharif crop further aggravates the deterioration of the ambient air quality over the region.

The Survey suggests various methods to address this issue which includepromoting the practice of conservation of agriculture with low lignocellulosic crop residues like rice, wheat, maize etc, role of agricultural machineries in helping farmers sow the seeds for the next season, creating a market for crop residue-based briquettes & mandating nearby thermal plants to undertake co-firing of crop-residues with coal, special credit lines for financing farm equipment and pollution control as a parameter for deciding incentives to States/UTs.

The Survey further highlights the Central Sector Scheme on ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi’. Under this scheme, agricultural machines and equipment for in-situ crop residue management such as Super Straw Management System for Combine Harvesters, Happy Seeders, Paddy Straw Chopper, Mulcheretc are provided with 50% subsidy to the individual farmers and 80 % subsidy for establishment of Custom Hiring Centres. 

Way Forward

The Economic Survey states that increased focus on sustainability requires various actions towards building individual and institutional capacity, accelerating knowledge and enhancing technology transferanddeployment, enabling financial mechanisms, implementing early warning systems, undertaking risk management and addressing gaps in implementation,up scaling and working with a spirit of cooperative federalism between States and Central Government.The Surveyfinally exhorts the developed countries tohonour their financial obligations and promises under the multilateral environmental agreements.

                The Economic Survey at the very onset says that while there is a case for Government intervention when markets do not function properly, excessive intervention especially when the market can do the job of enhancing citizens welfare perfectly well, stifles economic freedom and creates ‘deadweight loss’ which is the loss created by the wasted chance of creating a consumer and producer surplus and reduces wealth creation by not allowing efficient allocation of entrepreneurial resources and energy to productive activities thereby promoting economic dynamism. The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today.

Essential Commodities Act, 1955 

The Survey describes inter alia, the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) as anachronistic and irrelevant in today’s India as the Act was passed in 1955 in an India worried about famines and shortages. The Survey observes the frequent and unpredictable imposition of blanket stock limits on commodities under the ECA distorts the incentives for creation of storage infrastructure by the private sector, movement up the agricultural value chain and development of a national market for agricultural commodities. The Survey further notes that imposition of stock limits on Dal, Sugar and Onions had no effect on the volatility of retail and wholesale prices The Survey, providing clear evidence, suggests that the Act must be jettisoned in order to grant more economic freedom to the market and to facilitate the process of wealth creation in the economy. The Survey further says that the ECA only seems to enable rent seeking and harassment. 

Making Drugs Affordable 

Given the important task of ensuring access to essential life saving drugs and to avoid poor households from falling into poverty, Government often has to resort to controlling prices of drugs under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act.  The Survey expresses concerns over the regulation of drug prices through the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) and Drug Price Control Order (DPCO) as it often leads to an increase in the prices of the regulated drug vis-a-vis that of a similar unregulated drug which is counter-productive and leads to a sub-optimal outcome. The Survey further explains how the increase in prices of drugs is greater for expensive formulations than for cheaper ones and also greater for those sold in hospitals rather than retail shops thereby making DPCO counter-productive to its objective of making drugs affordable.

The Survey suggests that as Government is a huge buyer of drugs through its various arms such as CGHS, Defense, Railways etc., it can intervene more effectively to provide affordable drugs by combining all its purchases and thereby exercise bargaining power. The Survey advises Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and its related arms to imbibe the evidence to evolve non-distortionary mechanisms that utilises Government’s bargaining power in a market oriented transparent manner. The Surveys says that the Act interferes with the market functioning and provides incentives that are detrimental to wealth creation thereby adversely affecting both social welfare and economic development. 

Rationalisation of Food Subsidies

The Survey observes that Government policies in the foodgrain markets have led to the emergence of Government as the largest procurer and hoarder of rice and wheat which has led to burgeoning food subsidy burden and inefficiencies in the markets affecting the long run growth of agricultural sector and adversely affecting competition in these markets. This has led to overflowing of buffer stocks with FCI, burgeoning food subsidy burden, divergence between demand and supply of cereals and acted as a disincentive towards crop diversification. The Survey suggests foodgrains policy needs to be dynamic and allow switching from physical handling and distribution of foodgrains to cash transfers/food coupons/smart cards.

Debt Waivers Disrupt Credit Culture

According to the survey, an analysis of the debt waivers given by States/Centre shows that full waiver beneficiaries consume less, save less, invest less and are less productive after the waiver when compared to the partial beneficiaries. Debt waivers disrupt the credit culture and end up reducing the formal credit flow to the very same farmers, thereby defeating the very purpose of the debt waiver provided to farmers. The share of formal credit decreases for full beneficiaries when compared to partial beneficiaries, thereby defeating the very purpose of the debt waiver provided to farmers.

The Survey makes the case that the Government must systematically examine areas where it needlessly intervenes and undermines markets. Eliminating such instances will enable competitive markets and thereby spur investments and economic growth.

Reiterating the Government's focus on doubling farmers income by 2022, the Economic Survey 2019-2020 tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today emphasized on mechanization of agriculture, livestock and fisheries sector, food processing, financial inclusion,agricultural credit and crop insurance, micro irrigation and buffer stock management.

 



 

Agriculture Mechanization

With the shrinking land and water resources andlabour force, the onus rests on mechanization of production and post-harvesting operations says Economic Survey. Agriculture Mechanization will help Indian farming transform into commercial farming from subsistence farming. Emphasizing on the need to enhance mechanization in agriculture,  Economic Survey pointed out that in India, mechanization is 40 percent compared to China (59.5 percent) and Brazil (75 percent). 

Livestock and Fisheries Sector 

Livestock income has become an important secondary source of income for millions of rural families and has assumed an important role in achieving the goal of doubling farmers’ income, says Economic Survey. Livestock sector has been growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.9 per cent during last five years. 

Economic Survey further states that fisheries remain an important source of food, nutrition, employment and income in India.  It provides livelihood to about 16 million fishers and fish farmers in the country. Fisheries sector has registered annual average growth rate of more than 7 per cent in the recent years. Recognizing the importance of the sector independent department of Fisheries has been created in 2019.  

Food Processing

Further stressing on the goal of doubling farmers income by 2022, Economic Survey stressed on the need to promote food processing sector as higher level of processing helps in the reduction of wastage, improves value addition, promotes crop diversification, ensures better return to the farmers, promotes employment as well as increases export earnings. During the last 6 years ending 2017-18, Food Processing Industries sector has been growing at an Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR) of around 5.06 per cent says, Economic Survey. The Sector constitutes as much as 8.83 per cent and 10.66 per cent of Gross Value Added (GVA) in Manufacturing and Agriculture sector respectively in 2017-18 at 2011-12 prices.

Financial Inclusion, Agricultural Credit and Crop Insurance

Economic Survey also pointed out the need for increasing financial inclusion in north east areas to rectify highly skewed distribution of credit in North East. Highlighting the need for crop insurance, Economic Survey underscores the benefits of Pradhan Mantri FasalBimaYojana(PMFBY) which has been under implementation since 2016 to provide  risk coverage from pre-sowing to post harvest natural preventable risks.  PMFBY envisages increase in coverage from the existing 23 per cent to 50 per cent of Gross Cropped Area(GCA).  Government has also created a National Crop Insurance Portal which provides interface among all stakeholders.  

Gross Value Added in Agriculture

Following the natural trajectory of development process and owing to structural changes taking place in economy share of agriculture and allied sectors in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country at current prices has declined from 18.2 per cent in 2014-15 to 16.5 per cent in 2019-2020.  

 



 

Buffer Stock Management

Economic Survey further proposed revision of rates under National Food Security Act to address the issue of burgeoning food subsidy bill. Economic Survey also advises for prudent management of Food Corporation of India (FCI) buffer stocks.

Micro Irrigation 

To increase water use efficiency at farm level, Economic Survey advises further penetrationof Micro Irrigation(drip and sprinkle irrigation) through schemes like Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY).  Economic Survey also mentions the dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund(MIF) with an initial corpus of Rs. 5,000 crores created with NABARD.

                The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today.  The Economic Survey gave a detailed analysis of the trends in India’s infrastructure sector.

The Survey emphasized that investment in infrastructure is necessary for growth.  Power shortages, inadequate transport and poor connectivity affects overall growth performance.  Since provision of adequate infrastructure is essential for inclusive growth,  India recently launched the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for the period FY 2020-2025.

To achieve GDP of USD 5 trillion by 2024 – 2025, India needs to spend about USD 1.4 trillion (Rs.100 lakh crore) over these years on infrastructure so that lack of infrastructure does not become a constraint to the growth of Indian economy.  NIP is expected to enable well prepared infrastructure projects that will create jobs, improve ease of living and provide equitable access for infrastructure for all thereby making growth more inclusive, the Survey observes.

As per the NIP, Central Government (39 per cent) and State Government (39 per cent ) are expected to have equal share of funding of the projects followed by the private sector (22 per cent).  Projects worth Rs.42.7 lakh crore (42 per cent) are under implementation.  Financing of the National Infrastructure Pipeline will be a challenge but the Survey hoped that a bouquet of well prepared project will attract from Central and State Government, urban local government, banks and financial institutions, PE funds and private investors, both local and foreign.

The Economic Survey gave an overview of sectoral developments relating to Railways, Road Transport, Civil Aviation, Shipping, Telecom, Petroleum and Natural Gas, Power, Mining, Housing and Urban Infrastructure.

Road Sector

The Economic Survey noted that, road transport is the dominant mode of transportation in terms of its contribution to Gross Value Added (GVA).  In 2017-2018 the share of transport sector in the GVA was about 4.77 per cent of which the share of road transport is 3.06 per cent followed by Railways (0.75 per cent), air transport (0.15 per cent) and water transport (0.06 per cent).

Total investment in the roads and highways sector has gone up more than 3 times in five year period of 2014-15 to 2018-19. 

Railways

            The Survey marked that during the year 2018-19 Indian Railways carried 120 crore tones of freight and 840 crore passenger making it the world’s largest passenger carrier and fourth largest freight carrier.

Civil Aviation

            Taking a comprehensive view of Civil Aviation the Survey observed that India has 136 commercially managed airports by Airport Authority of India and 6 under Public Private Partnerships for operation, maintenance and development of airports.  A total 43 airports have been opeartionalized since the scheme for operationalizing unserved airports (UDAN) was taken up.  India stood first along with 7 other countries in airport connectivity according to the Global Competitiveness Report 2019 of World Economic Forum.

            To ease the strain on existing airport capacities 100 more airports are to be made operational by FY 2023-24.  The Survey noted that to continue with the high growth trajectory the Government has been providing a congenial environment so that Indian carrier double their fleet from about 680 aircraft at the close of 2019 to 1200 by FY 2023-24.

Shipping

            Talking about the strides in the Shipping sector, the Economic Survey stated that around 95 per cent of India’s trade by volume and 68 per cent in terms of value is transported by sea.  As on 30th September 2019 India had a fleet strength of 1,419 ships.

            The major ports in the country have an installed capacity of 1514.09 MTPA as on March 2019 and handled traffic of 699.09 MT during 2018-19.  The Survey said that the Ministry of Shipping is striving to improve operational efficiencies through mechanization, digitization and process simplification.  The average turnaround time  in 2018 improved to 59.51 hours as against 64.43 hours in 2017-18.`

Telecom Sector

Taking a view of the Telecom Sector the Economic Survey noted that there are four major players in the telecom sector in India today  - three in the private sector and BSNL and MTNL in the public sector. The Survey highlighted that since the price the price of data in India is among the lowest in the world it will help to achieve the goal of developing broad-band highways as part of the digital India campaign.   The Government is implementing the Bharat Net programme in a phased manner for providing Broadband connectivity to all the 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats in the country.

Petroleum and Natural Gas

The Economic Survey observed that India is the 3rd largest energy consumer in the world after USA and China.  India’s energy requirement is fulfilled primarily by coal, crude oil, renewable energy and natural gas.  With major reforms undertaken by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in exploration and licensing policy to enhance exploration activities, attract domestic and foreign investment and accelerate domestic production of oil and gas from existing fields there has been a surge of reserves of crude oil in 2019.

The Survey said that India has a refining capacity of 249.4 MMTPA and is the fourth largest in the world after the United States, china and Russia.  There is a need to augment refining capacity to meet the growing demand for petroleum fuels and petrochemicals.

The Survey felt that in order to encourage the participation of private entities in oil and natural gas sector government has undertaken several reform measures which includes simplified fiscal and contractual terms, bidding of exploration blocks under Category -2 and 3 sedimentary basins without any production or revenue sharing to government, early monetization of discoveries by extending fiscal incentives, incentivizing gas production including marketing and pricing freedom, induction of latest technology and capital, more functional freedom to national oil companies for collaboration and private sector participation for production enhancement methods in nomination fields.

Power

The Economic Survey also noted that the constant efforts of the Government to foster investments in the power sector has resulted in India improving its ranking to 76 position in Energy Transition Index by the World Economic Forum.  Also, universal electrification progress has been made in generation and transmission of electricity.  The installed capacity has increased from 3,56,100 MW in March 2019 to 3,64,960 MW as on 31st October 2019. 

            The Survey underlined that access to electricity is necessary for making growth inclusive and for promoting ease of living.  Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA) was launched on September 25, 2017 with an outlay of Rs.16,320 crores to achieve universal household electrification by providing last mile connectivity by 31-03-2019.  The Survey observed that except for few households in Left Wing Extremism affected Bastar Region of Chhattisgarh all the states have reported electrification of all households on the SAUBHAGYA portal.

Mining Sector

            The Economic Survey stated that India produces 95 minerals which include four hydrocarbon energy minerals, five atomic minerals, ten metallic, 21 non-metallic and 55 minor minerals.  Mining and quarrying sector contributes about 2.38 per cent to GVA during 2018-19. On a positive note the Survey stated that there has been a notable turn around in mineral production because of policy reforms and production of major minerals during the year 2018-19 has recorded a growth of 25 per cent when compared to last year in terms of value.

Housing and Urban Infrastructure

            While giving a overview of the construction sector the Survey said that it accounts for 8.24 per cent of GDP which includes housing and employs about 12 per cent of the work force.  The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana –Urban (PMAY-U) was launched in June 2015.  The Survey said that it is one of the largest housing schemes of the world covering entire urban India and is being implemented through four verticals.  The scheme is moving towards achieving the vision of pucca house to every household by 2020.  Thirtytwo lakh houses have been completed and delivered.

            Since the Survey noted since the launch of the Smart City Mission in 100 cities 5,151 projects worth more than Rs.2 lakh crore are at various stages of implementation.  A total of 1,290 projects worth Rs.22,569 crores have been completed and are operational.

                Considering India's demographic advantage of a large young population in the productive age group, improvements in social sectors like education and health leave a profound impact on the quality of life of the people and productivity of the economy. Developments in this regard form a prominent plank of the Economic Survey 2019-20, which was tabled by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, in Parliament today. The Survey underscores the prominent increase in expenditure on social services, as a proportion of GDP, by 1.5 percentage points during the period 2014-15 to 2019-20 from 6.2 to 7.7 per cent.

Education:

The Government's interventions in the education sector aim to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-4 of inclusive and equitable quality education for all by 2030, notes the Economic Survey. With this objective, Samagra Shiksha 2018-19 has been launched to envisage school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level. Other initiatives include the expansion of Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Innovative Learning Program (DHRUV), Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA) platform and e-content sites like e-pathshala.

The Pre-Budget Survey also outlines initiatives taken for improving quality of learning and teaching in higher and technical education. These include setting up of Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA), Schemes like National Educational Alliance for Technology (NEAT), Education Quality Upgradation and Inclusion Programme (EQUIP), PARAMARSH and mega online degree programme SWAYAM 2.0 among others.

""As per Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE) 2017-18 (provisional), 98.38 per cent of Government elementary schools have girls' toilet and 96.23 per cent of Government elementary schools have boys' toilet. 97.13 per cent of Government elementary schools have provision of drinking water facility,"" the Survey states. This data highlights the Government's commitment to uphold the Right to Education Act, 2009.

The Government has initiated the process of formulating a New Education Policy with focus on quality education, innovation and research. The Economic Survey recognizes high drop-out rates at various levels of schooling and lack of affordability in higher education as areas of concern.

Health:

Ayushman Bharat, the world’s biggest health care Scheme to improve access to health and delivery of health services at massive scale, has set up 28,005 Health & Wellness Centres as on 14th January 2020. ""To promote preventive healthcare, one and half lakh Ayushman Bharat- Health  and Wellness Centres are proposed to be set up by 2022,"" the Survey elaborates. Mission Indradhanush has vaccinated 3.39 crore children and 87.18 lakh pregnant women of 680 districts across the country till date. In addition, to address the social determinants of health, the Government has adopted Mission Mode Initiatives such as Eat Right and Eat Safe, Fit India, Anaemia Mukt Bharat, Poshan Abhiyan and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Further, all commercial operations in e-cigarettes have been banned recently. 

As per the latest National Health Accounts 2016-17, the out of pocket expenditure (OoPE) on health as a percentage of total health expenditure declined from 64.2 per cent in 2013-14 to 58.7 per cent in 2016-17, observes the Economic Survey. Various schemes have enabled this enhanced access to healthcare, including Free Drugs Service initiative, Free Diagnostics Service initiative, Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana (PMVJP) and Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP), as per the Economic Survey.

To upgrade medical infrastructure, the Government has sanctioned 141 new medical colleges in the last 5 years, the Economic Survey notes. The Government has also supported States to add nearly 2.51 lakh additional health human resources.

                Employment generation, coupled with improving employability has been the priority of the Government. Significant progress made in this direction forms a major  highlight of the Economic Survey 2019-20, which was presented by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, in Parliament today. ""General education improves knowledge of the people while skill training enhances their employability and equips them to tackle requirements of labour market,"" states the Economic Survey.

Skill Development

Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), a key initiative under the Government's Skill India Mission, enables youth to take up Short Term Training (STT) and get their skills certified through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under PMKVY (2016-20), 69.03 lakh candidates have been trained throughout the country as on 11th November, 2019, details the Survey. The pre-Budget document also takes note of the range of reforms introduced to the Apprenticeship Rules, 1992 for expansion and outreach of apprenticeship policy. 

Further, to enhance the employability of female workers, the Government is providing training to them through a network of women Industrial Training Institutes, National Vocational Training Institutes and Regional Vocational Training Institutes, the Economic Survey observes.

Employment

Along with efforts for generating additional employment, special focus has been on improving quality of jobs and formalisation of the economy, notes the Economic Survey. The share of regular wage/salaried employees has increased by 5 percentage points from 18 per cent in 2011-12 to 23 per cent in 2017-18. In absolute terms, there was a significant jump of around 2.62 crore new jobs with 1.21 crore in rural areas and 1.39 crore in urban areas in this category. ""Remarkably the proportion of women workers in regular wage category have increased by 8 percentage points (from 13 per cent in 2011-12 to 21 per cent in 2017-18) with addition of 0.71 crore new jobs for female workers in this category,"" the Survey highlights. The distribution of workers in self-employed category remained same while the proportion of workers in casual labour category decreased by 5 percentage points from 30 per cent in 2011-12 to 25 per cent in 2017-18 with the decline being in rural areas.

The Economic Survey underscores various programmes and legislative measures that are in place to encourage female participation in the economy. These include enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks and provisions for mandatory crèche facility in establishments with 50 or more employees, among others. The Survey also outlines the initiatives that have been implemented for women empowerment across the country, such as Mahila Shakti Kendra Scheme, Women Helpline Scheme, establishment of One Stop Centres etc., as well as schemes to ensure safety of women at workplace and support female entrepreneurship.

                Provisioning of social assets, including housing for all, drinking water and sanitation measures, has been a major pillar of the Government's efforts at building social infrastructure. This is one of the key highlights of the Economic Survey 2019-20, which was tabled by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, in Parliament today.

Housing for All:

""As per recent NSO survey on Drinking Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Housing Condition in India 2018, about 76.7 per cent of the households in the rural and about 96.0 per cent in the urban areas had the house of pucca structures,"" states the Economic Survey. 

The two Schemes, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U), seek to achieve the target of housing for all by 2022. Under PMAY-G, the number of houses completed in a year increased by more than four times, from 11.95 lakh in 2014-15 to 47.33 lakh in 2018-19, states the Survey.

Drinking Water and Sanitation:

Since the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission- Gramin (SBM-G) in 2014, over 10 crore toilets have been built in rural areas, says the Economic Survey. Further, over 5.9 lakh villages, 699 districts, and 35 States/UTs have declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODF). Swachh Survekshan Gramin 2019, India's largest rural sanitation survey, covered 17,450 villages in 698 districts across India, including 87,250 public places. 

A 10 Year Rural Sanitation Strategy (2019-2029) has also been launched to focus on sustaining the sanitation behaviour change and increasing access to solid and liquid waste management, notes the pre-Budget Survey. Further, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) was launched to accelerate progress on water conservation actitvities in the most water stressed blocks and districts across India. JSA has delivered over 3.5 lakh water conservation measures in 256 districts till date, and has seen participation of around 2.64 crore people, making it a Jan Andolan, the Survey emphasises.

                Investment in social infrastructure is a pre-requisite for inclusive growth and employment. The Government's commitment towards social well-being is a major highlight of the Economic Survey 2019-20 which was presented by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, in Parliament today. 

Trends in Expenditure on Social Services

As per the Economic Survey, the expenditure on social services by the Centre and States increased from 7.68 lakh crore in 2014-15 to 15.79 lakh crore in 2019-20 (Budget Estimate). As a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the expenditure on social services has registered an increase of 1.5 percentage points during the period 2014-15 to 2019-20 from 6.2 to 7.7 per cent. The expenditure on education, as percentage of GDP increased from 2.8 per cent to 3.1 per cent between 2014-15 and 2019-20 (BE). Similarly, expenditure on health increased from 1.2 per cent to 1.6 per cent during the same period as percentage of GDP, the pre-Budget document notes.

Human Development

India's rank in the Human Development Index (HDI) improved to 129 in 2018 from 130 in 2017, reaching a value of 0.647. With 1.34 per cent average annual HDI growth, India is among the fastest improving countries. Among its BRICS peers, India is ahead of China (0.95), South Africa (0.78), Russian Federation (0.69) and Brazil (0.59). To sustain this momentum in human development and to further accelerate it, the role of public sector in delivery of social services is critical, observes the Survey.

                The Government is committed to support the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) which is an important sector of the Indian economy that fosters entrepreneurship and generates employment opportunities at lower capital cost.  

The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today.  The Economic Survey gave a detailed analysis of all the measures undertaken to support the MSME sector in India to ensure better credit flow, technology up-gradation, ease of doing business and market access.

The Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi on 2nd November 2018, announced key reforms for faster growth of this sector.  The initiatives and the status of these initiatives are :

(i) In-principle approval for loans up to Rs.1 crore within 59 minutes through on-line portal.  1,59,422 number of loans have been sanctioned involving Rs.49,330 crore.  Of this, Rs.37,106 crore have been disbursed upto October 2019.  

(ii)  Interest subvention of 2 per cent for all GST registered MSMEs on incremental credit upto Rs.1 crore.   SIDBI has received and settled claim of Rs.18 crore from 43 banks/NBFCs for the period from November 2018 to March 2019.

(iii)  All companies with a turnover more than Rs.500 crore to be mandatorily on TReDS platform to enable entrepreneurs to access credit from banks.  So far 329 companies have registered themselves on the TReDS portal.

(iv) All Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) to compulsorily procure at least 25 per cent of their total purchases from MSMEs.  CPSUs have procured goods and services worth Rs. 15,936.39 crore from 59,903 MSMEs.

                The Finance Minister hasrepeatedly assured Bankers that adequate measures would be takento protect honest commercial decisions taken by them and distinction would be made between genuine commercial failures and culpability.Every Bank was also required to take steps to dispose of internal disciplinary and vigilance cases in a time bound manner so that such cases do not linger on account of procedural delay so asto avoid adverse impact on staff morale and reduce scope for harassment.As part of this endeavor of Government, Section 17A was incorporated in Prevention of Corruption Act requiring prior permission before initiating investigation against a public servant. 

 

The Central Vigilance Commissionhas, considering the complexities involved in the commercial decisions of managers in public sector,   in the meanwhile,also set up the Advisory Board for Banking and Financial Frauds (ABBFF)for a mandatory first level examination on suspected frauds in excess of Rs.50 croreinvolving publicservantsequivalent in rank to  GMs&above, beforeenquiry or investigations begin.

 

Government has now modifiedits 2015 framework onlarge value fraudsdoing away with the personal responsibility of the MD & CEOs of PSBs for compliance withvarious prescribedtimelines.Powers have been delegated by Department of Financial Services (DFS)to the Boardsof Public Sector lenders to put in place a suitable mechanism for ensuring compliance of the various timelines laid down in RBI and CVC circular(s). Similarly, the instructions of DFS of 2015 regarding compulsory examination of fraud for all NPA accounts exceeding Rs. 50 crorehavebeen aligned with the CVC circular of 15th Jan, 2020 whereby all such cases of suspicious  fraud are to be initially referred to the ABBFF. 

 

Government has separately directedBanks on 27.01.2020 to set up a committee of senior officers to monitor progress of pending disciplinary and internal vigilance casesas procedural delay, on one hand, adversely affects morale of the employees and on the other, breeds inefficiencies in the system.Therefore, every Bank must setup a Committee of Senior  Officers to review pending disciplinary and internal vigilance cases and frame timelinesto reduce delays in deciding such cases.

Union Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur has expressed confidence that with concerted efforts of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBIC), India would further improve its position in ranking for Ease of Doing Business. While addressing at Investiture Ceremony & International Customs Day 2020 here today, Shri Thakur said that India has risen in the Ease of Doing Business Rankings by being transparent, accountable and logical. This rise in rankings is due to the efforts of the officers of CBIC as Trading Across Borders is one of the key parameter of the rankings and it is credit to the efforts of CBIC that this key parameter has performed. 



While stressing on harnessing technology for faster resolution, the Minister said that technology plays an important role by ensuring efficiency, transparency and accountability. Shri Thakur appreciated the response of Custom officials to dynamics of changing ecosystem worldwide. Customs are doing well because they work as a team besides adapting and evolving, especially in a large and diverse country like India.

He said the 2020 theme of International Customs Organisation itself highlights the changing nature and role of customs today. The theme of International Customs Day, celebrated on 26th January every year, is dedicated to the contribution of Customs towards a sustainable future where social, economic, health and environmental needs are at the heart of our actions, with the slogan “Customs fostering Sustainability for People, Prosperity and the Planet”.

Shri Thakur gave away the awards to CBIC Officers & Staff for their meritorious services on the occasion of Investiture Ceremony & International Customs Day. Presidential Award of Appreciation Certificates and World Customs Organization (WCO) Certificates of Merit Award were also presented to the distinguished officers of the CBIC. 

Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, Revenue Secretary, also spoke about the thrust on enhancing trade facilitation and the role of other stakeholders including participating government agencies. Revenue Secretary emphasized on use of technology in ensuring Ease of Doing Business.

Dr. John Joseph, Chairman CBIC, while congratulating the awardees highlighted recent key initiatives taken by the Customs for enhancing trade facilitation in line with the Action Plan for implementing the Trade Facilitation Agreement of the WTO ratified by India.  He also complimented the officers for their dedicated work especially in the area of preventing smuggling of environmentally sensitive items, flora and fauna. Chairman CBIC said that officers of CBIC are fully committed towards hassle free trade and taking India to newer heights in Ease of Doing Business rankings.

                The Government of India, the Government of Maharashtra and the World Bank today signed a loan agreement ofUSD 210 million to support small holder farmers participate in competitive agriculture value chains, facilitate agri-business investments, increase market access and productivity in focus commodities, and build resilience of crops to recurrent floods or droughts in the Indian state of Maharashtra.

The USD210 million Maharashtra Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project, will help build capacity of the nodal departments and institutions; increase private sector investments in agricultural value chains; remove constraints for producers and entrepreneurs in accessing emerging domestic and export markets; build the capacity of the state to respond to commodity-price fluctuations by providing access to timely information on markets and production trends; and enhance adoption of climate resilient production techniques in the state.

“Foreseeing the future risks of climate change, the Government of India is implementing several programs under its National Action Plan on Climate Change. In agriculture it promotes the use of less water and adoption of climate-smart practices and technologies,” said Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. “This project in Maharashtra is a significant step towards transforming the state's rural economy through sustainable agriculture practices and empowerment of farmers by connecting them directly to the markets,” he added.

The loan agreement was signed by Shri Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Government of India and by Mr JunaidKamal Ahmad, Country Director (India), World Bank on behalf of the World Bank.

Whereas, the project agreement was signed byShri Eknath Dawale, Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Government of Maharashtraand by Mr JunaidKamal Ahmad, Country Director (India), World Bank on behalf of the World Bank.

The project will be implemented in all 36 districts of Maharashtra. Over one million farming households will directly benefit from the project. At least 43 percent of farmers and farm-workers participating in project activities are expected to be women. Specific focus will be given to women-led enterprises and the participation of women in the decision-making processes of farmer producer organizations.

“The Government of Maharashtra aims to double agriculture exports from the state and transform the sector into a stable source of sustainable growth and economic development,” said Mr Junaid Kamal Ahmad, Country Director (India), World Bank. “This project will serve as the nucleus to fulfill the state’s much larger vision of an agriculture-based rural transformation.” 

Such an agricultural transformation is already under way in Maharashtra with an upsurge in the production of high value crops such as fruits and vegetables, pulses, and maize and soybean for animal feed. The state has emerged as one of the country’s largest producer and exporter of fruits, vegetables, pulses, cotton, and soybean. Whereas the area under cultivation for cereals such as rice and wheat has been declining since 2000. 

Many of these changes have led to several positive developments for Maharashtra where production is labour intensive (example, in horticulture and floriculture), is climate-resilient (pulse-based cropping systems increases resilience, e.g. pigeon pea intercropping leads to higher soil carbon sequestration than monocrop system) and responds to domestic and global market needs. 

However a combination of increasing production and downturn in the commodity prices are affecting farmers’ profitability. Commodities like cotton, soybean, sugar, (covering 44 per cent of the cropped area in Maharashtra), are strongly influenced by global price movements. Broad shifts in the global prices of such commodities affect farmers who then find it difficult to cover the cost of production in many cases. 

The focus of the project on enhancing the capacity of the state to effectively manage and deliver agricultural technical support and services, increasing credit linkages to formal financing institutions, improving Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) standards and investing in business development services will help small holder farmers become more competitive and increase their links to organized domestic and export markets.

“With a substantial urban population, relatively high per capita incomes, and highest industrialization levels, Maharashtra is well-placed for an agriculture-sector transformation. This project will strengthen the capacity of small holder farmers to cope with fluctuations in the commodity market and enhance their incomes. The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s private sector arm will also be actively engaged in project design and implementation,” saidShri Manivannan Pathy, Senior Agricultural Specialist and Shri Adarsh Kumar, Senior Agribusiness Specialist and World Bank’s Team Leaders for the project.

The USD 210 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has a 6-year grace period and a maturity period of 13.5 years.

                The Income Tax Department mounted a search on a group operating leading educational institutions having a large number of schools and colleges in Chennai and Madurai region. The search was conducted at the office of the Trust, residences of the trustees and key employees of the group. The charitable trusts are running a medical college and hospital, Engineering colleges and schools across Tamil Nadu. Search and survey operations were carried out at 64 places across the State.

During the search, evidences were unearthed of fee collected under various nomenclatures from students of Engineering colleges; schools run by the group which were received in cash and not accounted for;and cash receipts not accounted for in the hospital account. Loans and interest were seen repaid in cash which were earlier taken in cash for the purpose of unaccounted investments. These receipts were utilised for the purchase of properties by paying on-money.

The search has resulted in the seizure of around Rs.2 crore of unaccounted cash. Out of the unaccounted income detected so far, the group has admitted an amount of Rs. 532 crore as their undisclosed income. The searches are temporarily concluded and further investigations are under progress.

                Taking forward the mission of the Government against black money, particularly undisclosed foreign assets, the Income Tax Department conducted searches on 19th January, 2020, on a group which has been on their radar for having substantial undisclosed foreign assets. The operation covered 13 premises in NCR.

The group is a leading member of the hospitality industry, running a hotel abroad and a chain of luxury hotels under a prominent brand name, situated at various locations in India.

The search operation has so far resulted in seizure of unaccounted assets valued at Rs. 24.93 crore(cash of Rs. 71.5 lakh, jewellery worth Rs.23 crore and expensive watches valued at Rs.1.2 crore).

Evidence seized during the search reveals that a large amount of black money was stashed abroad by the group, through the mechanism of Trusts, formed in early 1990s in tax havens.

Such foreign holdings of the main persons have remained hidden for decades beneath complex multi layered structures, located in different countries, ensuring secrecy. Search action further revealed that one of the close relatives of the promoter family was intentionally introduced as a front to ostensibly escape the provisions of domestic tax laws. 

The investigation has successfully lifted the veil, leading to detection of  undisclosed foreign assets of more than Rs. 1000 crore, apart from domestic tax evasion of more than Rs. 35crore which may,inter alia, lead to consequences under the Black Money Act, 2015,as also,action under the Income-tax Act, 1961 respectively. Foreign assets include investment in a Hotel in UK, immovable properties in UK and UAE and deposits with foreign banks. Further investigations are in progress.

                Considering the difficulties faced by trade and industry in filing of returns, the government has decided to introduce several measures to ease the process. The Finance Ministry today said that now GST taxpayers can file their GSTR-3B returns in a staggered manner.

Presently the last date of filing GSTR-3B returns for every taxpayer is 20th of every month. From now on, the last date for filing of GSTR-3B for the taxpayers having annual turnover of Rs 5 crore and above in the previous financial year would be 20th of the month. Thus, around 8 lakh regular taxpayers would have the last date of GSTR-3B filing as 20th of every month without late fees. 

The taxpayers having annual turnover below Rs 5 crore in previous financial year will be divided further in two categories. The tax filers from 15 States/ UTs, i.e., Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Lakshadweep, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will now be having the last date of filing GSTR-3B returns as 22nd of the month without late fees. This category would have around 49 lakh GSTR-3B filers who would now have 22nd of every month as their last date for filing GSTR-3B returns.

For the remaining 46 lakh taxpayers from the 22 States/UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, Laddakh, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya, Assam, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha having annual turnover below Rs 5 crore in previous financial year will now be having last date of filing the GSTR-3B as 24th  of the month without late fees.

The Finance Ministry said that the necessary notification in this regard would be issued later by the competent authority.

                The Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri. Anurag Singh Thakur today said that Jammu and Kashmir has suffered immensely due to the historical mistakes, and this has had a detrimental impact on its political, social and economic development.  He said this while inaugurating various developmental projects at Nagrota, Jammu during the second day of the Central Government’s special public outreach programme to disseminate information about the implementation of its policies and programmes for the overall development of Jammu and Kashmir and its people.         

While addressing a large gathering, Shri Thakur said that the BDC elections in J&K was a historical step that made the local self government a part of the decision making authority of which they have been deprived of from the last seventy two years. He further said that the govt. wants grass root level participation to become an integral part of democracy which can then empower people socially, economically and politically. He also urged the Block Development Council members to implement the basic centrally sponsored schemes up to the gross root level to which they have been deprived of from many decades. 

With respect to the implementation of the GoI schemes and programmes, Shri Thakur said that the UT of J&K has done wonderful in Ayushman Bharat Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), Ujjwala Yojana and Swach Bharat etc. The Minister appreciated the role of J&K Administration on achieving target under Swach Bharat Mission and Saubhagya Yojana. He reiterated that the Prime Minister of India has taken the UT of J&K on top priority in terms of development. Giving details regarding centrally sponsored schemes, the Minister said that the UT of J&K stood first in the implementation of Ayushman Bharat Scheme, 18534 houses have been constructed under PMAY, 2.5 lac toilets were constructed under Swach Bharat and Ujjwala has reached to its hundred percent target in Jammu and Kashmir. He also urged the concerned authorities to speed up the execution of these centrally sponsored schemes for the benefit of the grass root level population and also emphasised to spread awareness about the various schemes of the Govt. like PM Jan Dhan Yojna, MGNREGA, PM Gram Sadak Yojna, PM Awas Yojna, National Health Mission, Ladli Beti, Old Age Pension and others.

The minister also said that DBT is a huge game changer in developmental and welfare paradigm of India as it has changed the way in which benefits and welfare of citizens is secured in India and ensured a great transparency. Talking about the sports talent in J&K, the Minister said that sports infrastructure in J&K will be upgraded as there is a huge potential among the youngsters and they were being held back in the past from achieving their dreams and glory by the lack of facilities. 

The Minister also emphasised the people of the UT of J&K to leave their past and urged to give efforts to make a New India.  

Earlier, during his visit, the Minister dedicated a permanent ambulance to the PHC Nagrota and promised to provide a mobile van health service on trial basis for three months only to provide basic health care facilities to the people at their doorsteps.

                The Government of India, the Government of Assam and the World Bank signed a loan agreement of $88 million here today to help modernize Assam’s passenger ferry sector that runs on its rivers including the mighty Brahmaputra.

A majority of Assam’s more than 361 ferry routes cross the Brahmaputra or serve its islands, providing a crucial means of transport to thousands of commuters in both the urban and rural areas of the Brahmaputra Valley. The Assam Inland Water Transport Project (AIWTP) will help Assam improve the passenger ferry infrastructure and its services and strengthen the capacity of the institutions running the inland water transport. Technically better designed terminals and energy-efficient vessels (both new and retrofitted) will make the ferry services more sustainable with least disruption to nature.

Shri Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, said that India’s large network of inland waterways can play a significant role in the country's economy. Its fuel efficiency contributes to lower operating costs and reduces environmental impact. He further said that in Assam, the rivers are a vital transport asset for its people. The Assam Inland Water Transport Project will help develop a modern, efficient and safe river transport system for the large volume of passengers and cargo carried by the vessels.

The loan agreement was signed by Shri Khare, on behalf of Government of India and Mr Junaid Kamal Ahmad, Country Director (India), World Bank on behalf of the World Bank.

Whereas, the Project Agreement was signed by Shri Adil Rashid, Commissioner (Assam Transport) and State Project Director on behalf of Government of Assam and Mr Kamal Ahmad on behalf of the World Bank.

Mr Kamal Ahmad said that Assam has the largest network of navigable waterways in India. The Government of Assam has taken on the challenge of modernizing the ferries sector which, though vital to the state, remains largely informal. He further said that with World Bank support, the government is creating an institutional framework that will mainstream Inland Waterways as a mode of transport that is both attractive and well-suited to a wide cross-section of people living in the Brahmaputra Valley of Assam.

The project will support the Government of Assam’s efforts to corporatise its own ferry activities. The Assam Shipping Company (ASC) will operate the government ferries and the Assam Ports Company (APC) will provide terminals and terminal services on a common-user basis to both public and private ferry operators.

Inland Water Transport is also a more sustainable mode of transport. It provides low-carbon and low-cost options when compared to the cost of constructing and maintaining flood-resilient roads and bridges across the long stretches of the Brahmaputra river.

Shri Atul Agarwal, Senior Transport Specialist and Mr Ninan Oommen Biju, Senior Port Specialist and World Bank’s Task Team Leaders for the project said that Assam’s ferry services are integral to the lives of the people living in the Brahmaputra valley of Assam, providing them with connectivity, mobility, and livelihoods, adding, that with better navigation aids, appropriate safety gear and more suitable marine engines, the ferry services are expected to get more reliable and safer.

The project will also help build modern ferry terminals. In doing so, the project will draw guidance from ‘working with nature’ principles that aim to design new infrastructure or rehabilitate existing infrastructure in a way that works with natural river processes.

Today, a quarter of all ferry passengers in the state are women and girls. The ferry terminals have few facilities, with limited seating (if any), or toilets or drinking water and most waiting areas are mostly overcrowded. Traveling on the vessels can be uncomfortable and difficult, particularly for women, children, older people, and for the differently-abled. The project will improve facilities for people using the ferry services and give special attention to the safety and security of women and girls.

The terminals will have better access, lighting and signages while the new vessels will allow for individual seats, and separate toilets. Moreover, a strengthened regulatory regime will ensure reduction in overloading, adherence to time schedule and better crew standards.

Loan of $88 million from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has a final maturity of 14.5 years including a grace period of five years.

                In order to ensure that the e-filing utility for filing of return for assessment year (A.Y) 2020-21 is available as on 1st April, 2020, the Income-tax Return (ITR) Forms ITR-1 (Sahaj) and ITR-4 (Sugam) for the A.Y 2020-21 were notified vide notification dated 3rd January, 2020. In the notified returns, the eligibility conditions for filing of ITR-1 & ITR-4 Forms were modified with an intent to keep these forms short and simple with bare minimum number of Schedules. Therefore, a person who owns a property in joint ownership was not made eligible to file the ITR-1 or ITR-4 Forms. For the same reason, a person who is otherwise not required to file return but is required to file return due to fulfilment of one or more conditions in the seventh proviso to section 139(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act), was also not made eligible to file ITR-1 Form.

After the aforesaid notification, concerns have been raised that the changes are likely to cause hardship in the case of individual taxpayers. The taxpayers with jointly owned property have expressed concern that they will now need to file a detailed ITR Form instead of a simple ITR-1 and ITR-4. Similarly, persons who are required to file return as per the seventh proviso to section 139(1) of the Act, and are otherwise eligible to file ITR-1, have also expressed concern that they will not be able to opt for a simpler ITR-1 Form.

The matter has been examined and it has been decided to allow a person, who jointly owns a single house property, to file his/her return of income in ITR-1 or ITR-4 Form, as may be applicable, if he/she meets the other conditions. It has also been decided to allow a person, who is required to file return due to fulfilment of one or more conditions specified in the seventh proviso to section 139(1) of the Act, to file his/her return in ITR-1 Form.

                The 2nd National GST Conference of the Commissioners of State Tax and Chief Commissioners of Central Tax was held here today under the chairmanship of Dr Ajay Bhushan Pandey, Revenue Secretary, Ministry of Finance.



The multi-faceted Conference was focused on brainstorming session for streamlining Goods and Services Tax (GST) system and plugging revenue leakages. This was the 2nd edition of all India Conference where both tax administrations came together formally to build synergy and to share their knowledge and best practices with intent to bring about uniformity in tax administrations. 

During the Conference, deliberations were held on a mechanism and machinery for disseminating inter-departmental data among various agencies like GSTC, CBDT, CBIC, FIU, DoR, DGGI and State Tax Administrations etc. in order to achieve efficiency in curbing evasion and augment revenue collection. 



Various presentations were made in the conference, notably, Commissioner (Investigation), CBIC presented an overview of fake/fraudulent ITC; DG, DRI, presented few novel cases unearthed by them, including a case having Pan-India operation and methodology to curb misuse of refund of ITC/IGST; DG, ARM, presented use of data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning for early identification of fraudulent practices needing enforcement action to bring a focused approach to the evaders without bringing inconvenience to the genuine taxpayers. CBDT and FIU-India made their presentations on exchange of data and disseminating STR for curbing evasion.

GST policy Wing, CBIC, presented ways to bridge the compliance gap and enhancing revenue, which would result in recovering unmatched credit, reviewing refunds, management of non-filers, reporting of electronic invoice to GST system and comprehensive and coordinated audit.

After the day-long in-depth deliberations, the following measures were decided for necessary action:


	To constitute a Committee of Centre and State officers to examine and implement quick measures in a given time frame to curb fraudulent refund claims including the inverted tax structure refund claims and evasion of GST. The Committee will come out with detailed SoP within a week, which may be implemented across the country by January end.
	Considering fraudulent IGST refund claims, it was explored to link foreign exchange remittances with IGST refund for risky and new exporter.
	All major cases of fake Input Tax Credit, export/import fraud and fraudulent refunds shall also be compulsorily investigated by investigation wing of the Income Tax Department.
	MoU would be signed among CBDT, CBIC and GSTN to exchange data through API, from CBDT to GSTN and CBIC and vice-versa. It was decided that this data should be shared on quarterly basis, instead of being shared on yearly basis. 
	To explore access to banking transactions including the bank account details by GST system, in consultation with RBI and NPCI. Suggestions were also received to make GST system aligned with FIU for the purpose of getting bank account details and transactions and also PAN based banking transaction.
	To share data of cases involving evasion and fraudulent refund detected by CBIC with CBDT and vice versa, so that proper profiling of these fraudsters could also be done.
	It was also suggested to provide a single bank account for foreign remittance receipt and refund disbursement.
	 A self-assessment declaration to be prescribed by suitable amendments in GSTR Forms in case of closure of businesses.
	To undertake verification of unmatched Input Tax Credit availed by taxpayers.


The Central Tax Zonal office of Mumbai and Vadodara also made presentations regarding best practices being followed by them in compliance management and revenue augmentation in their respective tax administrations. Later Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh also presented the best practices adopted by them. 

The approach of strengthening enforcement through data exchange, sharing knowledge and best practices for a common national goal that leads to enhanced compliance management and revenue augmentation and at the same time ensuring that genuine taxpayers are not harassed was welcomed by all.

All Chief Commissioners of Central Tax Zones, State Commissioners of State Taxes, Directors General of CBIC, members of CBIC, Chairman, CBDT along with his team of Senior officers, Director of FIU-India along with his team of Senior officers, senior officers of the CBIC and Department of Revenue, technical team of GSTN led by EVP GSTN and officers from the GST Council Secretariat etc. participated in the Conference.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 to amend the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. The Bill will be introduced in the ensuing session of theParliament.

Salient features of proposed amendments:


	Proposing requirement for opinion of one provider for termination of pregnancy, up to 20 weeks of gestation and introducing the requirement of opinion of two providers for termination of pregnancy of 20-24 weeks of gestation.
	Enhancing the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories of women which will be defined in the amendments to the MTP Rules and would include 'vulnerable women including survivors of rape, victims of incest and other vulnerable women (like differently-abled women, Minors) etc.
	Upper gestation limit not to apply in cases of substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by Medical Board. The composition, functions and other details of Medical Board to be prescribed subsequently in Rules under the Act.
	Name and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated shall not be revealed except to a person authorised in any law for the time being in force.


The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 is for expanding access of women to safe and legal abortion services on therapeutic, eugenic, humanitarianor social grounds. The proposed amendments includesubstitution of certainsub-sections, insertion of certain new clauses under some sections in the existing Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, with a view to increase upper gestation limit for termination of pregnancy under certain conditions and to strengthen access to comprehensiveabortioncare, under strict conditions, without compromisingservice andquality of safe abortion.

It is a step towards safety and well-being of the women and many women will be benefitted by this. Recently several petitions were received by the Courts seeking permission for aborting pregnancies at a gestational age beyond the present permissible limit on grounds of foetal abnormalities or pregnancies due to sexual violence faced by women. The proposed increase in gestational age will ensure dignity, autonomy, confidentiality and justice for women who need to terminate pregnancy.

In orderto increase access of women to safe abortion services and taking into account the advances in medical technology, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare proposed amendments after extensive consultation with various stake holders and several ministries.

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare held a high level review meeting with senior officers of the Health Ministry, ICMR and NCDC, here today, to analyse the current situation, preparedness and steps being taken for prevention and management of Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) in India. “The situation is being closely monitored at the highest level for adequate preparedness. All the officials of my Ministry, concerned departments and States/UTs have been put on high alert for Novel Coronavirus. We are taking all required possible precautions to manage all possible scenarios”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated. 

The Union Health Minister is personally reviewing and monitoring the preparedness on a daily basis. He is also in regular contact with Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO SEARO for technical support and guidance in the matter. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan has spoken to Chief Minister of Uttarakhand today and assured all support for screening at the border with Nepal, where a confirmed nCoV case has been reported.  He is also writing to the Chief Ministers of States requesting for their personal intervention to review the State preparedness for control and management of nCoV.

The Union Health Minister has directed for multidisciplinary central teams to be formed and sent to the seven states where thermal screening is being done at the seven designated airports (New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi). The central team shall consist of a public health expert, a clinician and a microbiologist. The teams shall reach the respective states tomorrow. They shall review the end-to-end preparedness for management and control of nCoV in the states including that at the airports, for thermal screening and transferring of patients to hospitals for isolation, and shall also visit the tertiary hospitals attached to the airports for reviewing the isolation wards and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and masks etc. They shall also review whether the infection control, surveillance and other guidelines are being followed. The teams shall coordinate with the State Health Secretaries to explore all avenues for further supporting and strengthening the states’ preparedness.

Under directions by Dr Harsh Vardhan, a 24x7 NCDC Call Centre (+91-11-23978046) has been made operational. The said Call Centre will monitor the list of contacts furnished by MEA; provide details of district and state surveillance officers to those who seek them; and in case of any clinical query, direct the concerned to the relevant Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officer. The Union Health Minister has urged the passengers who have a travel history to China since 1st January 2020 to come forward for self-reporting to the nearest health facility if they experience any symptoms such as fever, cough, respiratory distress etc., and also inform their treating doctor. 

Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that no nCoV case has been detected in the country so far. However, eleven (11) persons have been put under observation; out of samples taken from these 11 individuals, samples of four passengers have been confirmed to be negative for nCoV by the ICMR-NIV Pune lab. He added that timely measures and promptness of the officials of Union Health Ministry has resulted into vigilant actions. He also commended the media for creating awareness among the people.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that various steps have been taken up and continual efforts are being made by Health Ministry in close coordination with Ministry of Civil Aviation, MEA, State Governments and WHO. Close monitoring is being undertaken for all the passengers who are arriving from China and Hong Kong across 7 International Airports in India. All the passengers are undergoing thermal screening. Travel advisory/signages has been extended to 12 more airports in addition to the current seven. Advisory has also been issued to all States/UTs for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance to pick up any travel related case reported in the community and follow up contacts of suspect/confirmed cases. He added that the Ministry has issued guidelines for Surveillance and Contact Tracing; Infection Control; Lab Sample Testing and Clinical Care.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan added that National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune is fully geared up to test samples of nCoV. Ten other laboratories under Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s Viral Research and Diagnostics Laboratories (VRDL) network are also equipped to test such samples, if a need arises. Adequate stock of PPE is being maintained by Medical Stores Organization for airports, hospitals and laboratory use.

                Dr. HarshVardhan, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfarehas been closely monitoring the situation after the reports of 41 confirmed cases of novel Corona virus (nCoV) including one death from Wuhan, China on 5thJanuary, 2020.  According to WHO, the situation is still evolving and preliminary investigations suggest link to the sea food market. Coronaviruses are large family of viruses, which cause illnesses to people and also circulate in animals including camels, cats and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can also evolve and infect people.  

Ms Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), Government of India is regularly reviewing the public health preparedness in the country since the news broke out. As directed by the Health Ministry, meetings of the Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) were convened under the Chairmanship of Director General of Health Services (DGHS) on 8thand 15th January, 2020 with representations from various stakeholders (health and non-health sectors) and WHO. 

Secretary, (HFW) stated that “the public health preparedness is being reviewed on day-to-day basis and the core capacities to timely detect and manage importation of the nCoV into the country are being strengthened further”. She mentioned that the situation is being monitored in consultation with WHO and keeping in view the limited human to human transmission the risk at global level is perceived to be low. 

However, as a matter of abundant precaution the Ministry of Health has instructed screening of international travellers from China at designated airports namely, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkatathrough thermal scanners. In coordination with Ministry of Civil Aviation, in-flight announcements are also being made. A travel advisory has also been issued to the passengers travelling to and from China on the issue. A copy of the same is also available on the Health Ministry website.

The Health Ministry has issued necessary directions to all concerned on laboratory diagnosis, surveillance, infection prevention and control (IPC) and risk communication. Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) is geared up for community surveillance and contact tracing. The NIV Pune, ICMR Laboratory is coordinating the testing of samples for nCoV in the country.  The hospital preparedness with regard to management and infection prevention control facilities has been also reviewed during high level meetings and advisories, and IPC Guidelines have been shared with the States.  Adequate stocks of logistics including PPE is available. State governments have also been advised on the necessary precaution to be taken up on the issue. Ministry of Health is also in touch with Ministry of External Affairs, and the immigration officers at the said airports have been sensitized.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2019-20 in Parliament today. The Survey affirms that disinvestment improves firm performance and overall productivity, and unlock their potential to create wealth. This would have a multiplier effect on other sectors of the economy. Aggressive disinvestment, preferably through the route of strategic sale, should be utilized to bring in higher profitability, promote efficiency, increase competitiveness and to promote professionalism in management in CPSEs, the Survey advocates.

The Survey observes that the focus of the strategic disinvestment needs to be to exit from non-strategic business and directed towards optimizing economic potential of these CPSEs. This would, in turn, unlock capital for use elsewhere, especially in public infrastructure like roads, power, transmission lines, sewage systems, irrigation systems, railways and urban infrastructure. It is encouraging that the enabling provisions by Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) are already in place.

According to the Survey the Cabinet has ‘in-principle’ approved the disinvestment in various CPSEs. These need to be taken up aggressively to facilitate creation of fiscal space and improve the efficient allocation of public resources. 

The Survey notes that there are about 264 CPSEs under 38 different Ministries/Departments. Of these, 13 Ministries/Departments have around 10 CPSEs each under its jurisdiction. It is evident that many of the CPSEs are profitable. However, CPSEs have generally underperformed the market as is evident from the average return of only 4 percent of BSE CPSE Index against the 38 percent return of BSE SENSEX during the period 2014-2019. The aim of any privatization or disinvestment programme should, therefore, be the maximisation of the Government’s equity stake value.

The Survey suggests that the Government can transfer its stake in the listed CPSEs to a separate corporate entity. This entity would be managed by an independent board and would be mandated to divest the Government stake in these CPSEs over a period of time. This will land professionalism and autonomy to the disinvestment programme which, in turn, would improve the economic performance of the CPSEs.

The Survey says that in November, 2019, India launched its biggest privatization drive in more than a decade. An “in-principle” approval was accorded to reduce Government of India’s paid-up share capital below 51 percent in select Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). To examine the efficiency gains from privatization and whether the purported benefits of privatization have indeed manifested in the Indian context, the Survey analyses the before-after performance of 11 CPSEs that had undergone strategic disinvestment from1999-2000 to 2003-04.

The Survey also examines the change in performance for each individual CPSE. It studied the movement in major financial indicators for each of the firm ten years before and after the year of strategic disinvestment/privatization. Taken individually, each privatized CPSE witnessed improvement in net worth, net profit, gross revenue, net profit margin, sales growth in the post privatization period compared to pre privatization period (except for Hindustan Teleprinters, MFIL and Tata Communications in the case of few indicators).

                Union Minister of Heavy Industries &Public Enterprises, Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Information & Broadcasting, Prakash Javadekar today inaugurated ELECRAMA 2020, at India Expo Mart in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Minister of Power and New and Renewable Energy (Independent Charge) R K Singh and Minister of Industries in Uttar Pradesh Government, StatishMahana were also present on the occasion. ELECRAMA is the flagship showcase of the Indian electrical industry and a platform to connect the world with Indian industry in respect of technology, new trends and innovation for future energy transition.

In his special address, Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises said that the annual growth of energy should be 10% for many years to come even if the country’s economy grows at the rate of 6% annually. Referring to demand for more relief by the industry, he said that industry’s cause must translate into societal cause for the benefit of society as well as the industry.  He said that electricity for a poor household is not only a facility but also an empowerment and main source of inspiration. The Minister also referred to electrification of 18 thousand unelectrifiedvillages and congratulated the Power Minister, RK Singh for fulfilling this commitment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi within a time frame of 1000 days. He further stated that 3.5 crore households were given power connections under SAUBHAGYA (PradhanMantriSahajBijliHarGharYojana) scheme.

The Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises Minister asked the electrical industry to focus on quality of electrical equipment stating that main cause of fire incidents in many cases is poor quality of equipment and faulty wiring. The Minister urged the power industry to become part of product chain and not just supplier of spare parts. He mentioned the success story of LED bulbs which led to saving of thousands of crores of rupees in power bills to the customers and also protecting environmentthrough installation of 400 million LED bulb. Shri Javadekar said that energy efficiency is a big issue and to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change tools of energy efficiency must be used.

Emphasising on the quality of electrical goods, Shri Prakash Javadekarsaid there can be no compromise on quality. People want ease of living and new facilities for which electricity is an asset, the Minister pointed out.  People will need more electricity and more electrical equipment and therefore demands of power as well as electrical goods are bound to go up, said the Minister.  He said that the per capita consumption of energy is very low in India as compared to developed countries. 

The Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises Ministersaid that electrical vehicle is the future of India and the work on it has begun.  Electrical vehicles will reduce environmental pollution and also lead to efficiency in use of energy. He informed that there are around 5 lakh electrical vehicles including two wheelers and four wheelers in the country.

Speaking on the occasion, Power Minister R.K. Singh said that the electricity sector has been transformed in the last few years and the whole country has been connected with one grid and one frequency. Now India has become power surplus country and is exporting power. He said that investment in transmission and distribution system is continuing and will pick up pace. The Power Minister said that per capita consumption need to be tripled to reach the global average of 3600 units. He said that government is revamping energy tariff policy and any subsidy, that has to be given to any category of electricity consumers by the State Governments, should be done through direct benefit transfer scheme. The Power Minister also spoke about the need of reform in the power distribution system. He said that the government is coming out with a new trajectory of loss reduction and distribution companies will have to follow this trajectory if they want to get further grants from the Central Government or if they want to access loans from the Power Finance Corporation.

                To give a further push to clean mobility in Road Transport Sector, the Department of Heavy Industries has sanctioned 2636 charging stations in 62 cities across 24 States/UTs under FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India) scheme phase II.

As many as 317 EV charging stations have been allotted in Maharashtra, 266 in Andhra Pradesh, 256 in Tamil Nadu, 228 in Gujarat, 205 in Rajasthan, 207 in Uttar Pradesh, 172 in Karnataka, 159 in Madhya Pradesh, 141 in West Bengal, 138 in Telangana, 131 in Kerala, 72 in Delhi, 70 in Chandigarh, 50 in Haryana, 40 in Meghalaya, 37 in Bihar, 29 in Sikkim, 25 each in Jammu & Kashmir and Chhattisgarh, 20 in Assam, 18 in Odisha and 10 each in Uttarakhand, Puducherry and Himachal Pradesh. 

The sanction letters to the selected entities will be issued in phases after ensuring the availability of land for charging stations, signing of necessary agreements/MoU with concerned partner organizations like city municipal corporation, Discoms and oil companies. Subsequently, each selected public entities are required to initiate the procurement process in a time bound manner for deployment of sanctioned charging stations.

Minister of Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises, Prakash Javadekar said that in future at least one charging station will be available in most of the selected cities in a grid of 4 Km X 4 km. He said it will boost the confidence of users of Electric Vehicles and also encourage the OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) to launch the new electric vehicle models due to the lack of charging infrastructure.

Department of Heavy Industry had invited the Expression of Interest (EoI) from million-plus cities, smart cities, State/UT capitals and cities from special category states for submission of proposal for availing incentives under FAME India Scheme Phase II for deployment of EV charging infrastructure within Cities.

About 106 proposals from Public/Private Entities for the deployment of about 7000 EV charging stations were received. After evaluation of these proposals as per EoI, on the advice of Project Implementation and Sanctioning Committee (PISC) the Government sanctioned 2636 charging stations to 62 cities submitted by 19 public entities for 24 states. Out of these 2636 charging stations, 1633 Charging Stations will be Fast Charging Stations and 1003 will be slow charging stations. With this, about 14000 Charging Stations will be installed across the selected cities.

                National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) launched Police related Citizen centric services on CCTNS platform here today. Director, Intelligence Bureau, Shri Arvind Kumar presided over the two launches.

 These online services will help Citizens in Searching their Missing Persons and Generating Vehicle NOC. The services can be accessed through ‘digitalpolicecitizenservices.gov.in’ portal or through a link in the existing ‘Digital Police Portal’. So far such services are being provided through the state citizen portals and it is the first time that these are being launched centrally



Director, NCRB,Shri Ram Phal Pawar while addressing the gathering  informed that the two citizen services namely ‘Missing Person Search’ and ‘Generate Vehicle NOC’ will now be available online to Citizens. The Citizens can search for their missing kins against the national database of recovered unidentified found person/unidentified dead bodies from their homes. This will hugely benefit relatives of missing persons and save them from running around pillar to post, as all such details including photos are available in Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System and will now be accessible to citizens through this portal at their convenience.

In this user friendly search,citizen may enter search criteria in the portal and the system will search it from the available national database across country and will display the result immediatelywith photograph and other details.

Director also explained about another service for citizens ‘Generate Vehicle NOC’ which allows citizens to ascertain the status of a vehicle before its second hand purchase, as to whether it is suspicious or clean from Police records. This search could be made against National database based on vehicle’s details; one can generate and download the relevant NOC, required by the RTO beforethe transfer of ownership. 

NCRB and Cyber Peace foundation together have designed CCTNS Hackathon and Cyber Challenge 2020 with the aim to enhance skills and knowledge of law enforcement personnel at ground level. This Hackathon has been organized to offer a unique experience to the participants,to advance their skills and knowledge and to promote coordination with industry and academia.

NCRB and National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children’s (NCMEC), USA has signed a Memorandum of Understanding to receive information on such material originating from India. NCMEC is anon-profit organization establishedby the United States Congress.It has a centralized reporting system by which internet service providers across the world or intermediaries like facebook, youtube, etc. can report about persons who circulate images of child pornography. 

Director, Intelligence Bureau inaugurated the Cyber Tipline monitoring facility in the NCRB. He reiterated that intersection between crime and technology is more apparent today than ever before. Digital technologies and the internet have not only spurred cybercrimes but also made them much more sophisticated. It is thereforerequisite for law enforcement agencies to be agile skilled in the use of latest technology and adopt innovative methods to track, investigate and combat cybercrimes. He complimented NCRB for their efforts in promoting ‘Ease of living’.

            Director informed that approximately 25000Cyber Tipline Reports have been received so far and shared with States/UTs out of which 15 were of very high priority. As per details shared by States/UTs, 57 FIRs have already been registered, and investigation is in process for remaining Cyber Tipline Reports.  Senior officials from various police Organisations graced the occasion.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah presided over the signing of a historic agreement between Government of India, Government of Assam and Bodo representatives, in New Delhi today, to end the over 50-year old Bodo crisis. Further, a permanent solution has been found out for the problem that has cost the region over 4000 lives. 

Present on the occasion were Chief Minister of Assam, Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, Convenor, NEDA and Assam Minister, Shri Himanta Biswa Sarma, Chief Executive Member of BTC, Shri  Hagrama Mohilary, representatives of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), All Bodo Students Union (ABSU), United Boro People Organization (UBPO), National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) factions – Gobinda Basumatary, Dhirendra Boro, Ranjan Daimary, B. Saoraigwra, along with senior officers from Union Ministry of Home Affairs and the Government of Assam. 

With this agreement, over 1500 armed cadres will abjure violence and join the mainstream. A Special Development Package Rs. 1500 crores over three years will be given by the Union Government to undertake specific projects for the development of Bodo areas. 

 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Shah called this momentous occasion as the harbinger of a golden future for Assam, and that it was a direct consequence of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s policy of focusing on North-East region’s development. The fruition of this vision can also be seen in the Bru-Reang agreement signed on January 16, 2020 to end the humanitarian crisis in Meghalaya and Tripura, recent surrender of 644 armed cadres in Assam and surrender of 88 armed NLFT cadres in Tripura to bring them to mainstream, in addition to today’s agreement.

Shri Shah said that Assam’s territorial integrity is assured with this agreement, as every single Bodo group has come on board. He noted that while earlier the states of North East used to feel neglected, Modi government ensured that a Union Minister visited the region every week in order to ensure effective implementation of Government schemes and timely completion of infrastructure projects. 

 

  

The Home Minister added that this agreement is another success of Prime Minister’s vision of ‘Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikas, Sab ka Vishwas’, as with this agreement, Assam’s road to development has been cleared. Ever since assuming office, Shri Modi has initiated numerous policy level interventions that have improved infrastructure, connectivity, economic growth, tourism and social development of the region.

Talking on the salient features of the agreement, Shri Shah said that the objective of the MoS is to increase the scope and powers of the BTC and to streamline its functioning; resolve issues related to Bodo people residing outside Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD); promote and protect Bodo's social, cultural, linguistic and ethnic identities; providing legislative protection for the land rights of tribals; ensure quick development of tribal areas and rehabilitate members of NDFB factions.

The Minister said that in the past, not being satisfied with the settlements of 1993 and 2003, the Bodos have been consistently demanding more powers. A comprehensive and final resolution to their demands has been arrived at, while retaining the territorial integrity of the state of Assam. After Modi government came to power, intensive discussions were held since August 2019 with ABSU, NDFB factions and other Bodo organizations to reach a comprehensive solution to end the decades old Bodo movement.

 

    

 

After the agreement, the NDFB factions will leave the path of violence, surrender their weapons and disband their armed organizations within a month of signing the deal. The Union Government and the Government of Assam will take necessary measures to rehabilitate over 1500 cadres of NDFB (P), NDFB (RD) and NDFB (S), as per the laid down policy of the government. 

The current agreement proposes to set up a commission under Section 14 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India, which will recommend the inclusion or exclusion of tribal population residing in villages adjoining BTAD areas. In this commission, besides State government there will be representatives from ABSU and BTC. It will submit its recommendation within six months from the date of notification.

 

 

 

The Government of Assam will establish a Bodo-Kachari Welfare Council as per existing procedure. The Assam government will also notify Bodo language as an associate official language in the state and will set up a separate directorate for Bodo medium schools. The present settlement has proposal to give more legislative, executive, administrative and financial powers to BTC.

                In the aftermath of any disaster, many organisations and individuals work silently but effectively to alleviate suffering of the affected population. A good deal of work is done in research/ innovations in early warning, prevention, mitigation, preparedness, rescue, relief and rehabilitation. In order to recognise the excellent work done by individuals and institutions in India in the field of disaster management, Government of India has instituted an annual award known as Subhash Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskar. The award is announced every year on 23rd January, the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

The award scheme for the year 2020 was given wide publicity. Nominations for the award were solicited from 1st August, 2019 onwards. Last date for receipt of Nominations was 15th October 2019. The response to the award scheme was overwhelming, with about 330 nominations from institutions and individuals. For the selection of award, the nominations were scruitnised by the two high level Committees.

For the year 2020, Disaster Mitigation & Management Centre, Uttarakhand (in the institution category) and Shri Kumar Munnan Singh (Individual category) have been selected for the Subhash Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskar for their commendable work in Disaster Management. In case the winner being an institution, it shall receive a certificate and a cash prize of Rs. 51 lakhs. This cash prize shall be utilized by the winning institution for Disaster Management related activities only. In case of the winner being an individual, winner shall receive a certificate and a cash prize of Rs. 5 lakhs.

It may be recalled that for the year 2019, 8th Battalion of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) located at Ghaziabad, had been selected for the award for its commendable work in disaster management.

Following is a summary of the work of the winners of 2020 Award:

Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre (DMMC), Uttarakhand discharges the functions of State Disaster Management Authority under the Government of Uttarakhand. Since its establishment in 2006, it has coordinated various post disaster functions relating to coordination, requisition, information exchange and media briefing, including those after 2010, 2012 and 2013 major disaster incidences. DMMC has been organizing mock exercises at state, district and tehsil level with the support of NDMA and has trained State Government officials in Incident Response System (IRS) and organized incidence response trainings (IRTs) till tehsil level. DMMC ensures interaction with various scientific and academic institutions working in the field of DRR in the country for dissemination of emerging technologies and techniques amongst State Government departments through workshops.

The DMMC has extended research facilities to students and has published more than 50 papers in peer reviewed scientific journals. It has developed rich audio-visual and print IEC material that is one of the best in the country, particularly in Hindi and includes a Censor Board certified popular film ‘THE SILENT HEROES’ that was released on 11th December, 2015 in more than 200 theatres of 100 cities across the nation. This film highlights the importance of preparation and capacity building and carries the message of social inclusion. The work done by DMMC is innovative and original and ranges from pre-disaster preparation and capacity building to post-disaster response and rehabilitation. Continuity of these programs for almost two decades and keen interest shown in these by other states and countries is a measure of sustainability of these programs.

Shri Kumar Munnan Singh was appointed as a founder Member of the National Disaster Management Authority in 2005 following his commendable work during 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. In NDMA, Shri Singh envisioned and had taken painstaking efforts to establish, one of its kind specialist response force, the ‘National Disaster Response Force’ from scratch to today’s strong force of 14,000 personnel comprising of 12 battalions. Under the superintendence and directions of Shri Singh, NDRF delivered commendable response in its nascent phase itself during devastating Kosi foods, 2008.

Shri Singh also propounded and implemented the concept of Community Capacity Building by the NDRF as a force multiplier and as a result NDRF so far has trained around 60 lakh people who are the first responders amongst their community. Considering wide gap in the Indian disaster management framework, Shri Singh formulated the concept and curriculum for training of response forces and veterinarians for management of livestock during disasters. With comprehensive training and techniques, response forces have been able to timely evacuate and protect livestock during a disaster. Protection of animals during disasters is directly related to livelihood issue of rural population. It is hoped that this initiative of Shri Singh will have a significant and positive impact on livelihood sustainability of rural population in areas vulnerable to perennial floods and cyclones.

                Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy visited Ganderbal district today as part of the elaborate outreach programme of the central government in the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir. As part of his three day tour to Kashmir, the Minister visited Ganderbal District on his first day. He interacted with the local people and official stakeholders. He also assessed the progress under several schemes of the central government. The Minister laid foundation stones for projects worth over Rs. 20 crores.

Shri Reddy called upon the people to be equal partners in the development of the UT. He said that the UT of Jammu and Kashmir has a huge potential to come up as the power house of the Nation. This potential will now be unleashed with the right policy interventions and honest intentions. He unequivocally asserted that development of Jammu & Kashmir along with renewed growth prospects for the residents will be on top of the agenda and all necessary steps will be taken towards this end.

Addressing a huge gathering at Ganderbal, Shri Reddy highlighted the fact that the first step towards building a growth story for Kashmir has been removing all policy bottlenecks and addressing corruption. He said that it was unfortunate that many essential projects such as drinking water, power generation etc. had been languishing for years and some even for decades.

He said that 1644 languishing projects in key sectors with investment of Rs. 3,631 crores have been approved. He further assured the people that work under the Prime Minister Development Package (PMDP) projects have been fast tracked and said that out of 63 projects, 14 have been completed/substantially completed and others are at various stages of implementation.

Further, highlighting the reforms in the power sector, the Minister said that along with fast tracking the stalled projects such as the Shahpur Kandi Dam project, initiated after being in a limbo for 40 years, work has begun on several others to ensure constant power supply, a crucial factor in growth and development. He highlighted some of the initiatives including, several projects such as Ujh Multipurpose project and Ratle Hydropower project rejuvenated after languishing for years.

Shri Reddy said that developing a robust health infrastructure in Jammu & Kashmir is also high on priority of the Modi government. He informed that the two AIIMS at Samba and Avantipora, which were stalled due to land and forest issues have now been cleared for completion. Five new Medical Colleges at Baramulla, Anantnag, Rajouri, Kathua and Doda have been approved, which is the single largest addition in last 70 years, he further added.

Focusing on the importance of skilled youth in J&K’s development, the Minister said that an equal focus of the Modi government has been and shall remain on employment and skill development of the youth. He said that it is the youth who have to script Jammu & Kashmir’s growth story and the Central Government will ensure that they have an enabling platform. For this, he added, education and skill development will be a focus area of the government.

Shri Reddy said that to ensure that our vision is translated into reality, the central government has worked to plug loopholes and tighten the noose on corruption. As part of the event, Shri Kishan Reddy also distributed pension books to senior citizens ensuring monthly financial support of upto Rs 1000.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah presided over the signing of an agreement between Government of India, Governments of Tripura and Mizoram and Bru-Reang representatives in New Delhi today, to end the 23-year old Bru-Reang refugee crisis. Present on the occasion were Chief Minister of Mizoram, Shri Zoramthanga, CM of Tripura, Shri Biplab Kumar Deb, Chairman, NEDA, Shri Himanta Biswa Sarma, Chairman, TIPRA, Shri Pradyot Kishore Debbarma, representatives of Bru tribes, along with senior officers.

 



 

This historic agreement is in line with PM Modi’s vision for the progress of the North East and the empowerment of the people of the region. Ever since taking office, PM Modi has initiated numerous policy level interventions that have improved infrastructure, connectivity, economic growth, tourism and social development of the region.

Briefing the media, Shri Shah said that under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi a permanent solution has been arrived to this long standing issue of rehabilitating thousands of Bru-Reang people in Tripura and they can now look towards a bright future. Under the new agreement, he informed, around 34,000 Bru refugees will be settled in Tripura and would be given aid from the Centre to help with their rehabilitation and all round development, through a package of around Rs 600 crores. These people would get all the rights that normal residents of the States get and they would now be able to enjoy the benefits of social welfare schemes of Centre and State governments. The settlement has been reached after detailed discussions held by Union government with the State governments of Mizoram and Tripura and the representatives of Bru tribes and it was decided that the Bru refugees, he added.

 



 

The Home Minister informed that under the new arrangement, each of the displaced families would be given 40x30 sq.ft. residential plots, in addition to the aid under earlier agreement of a fixed deposit of Rs. 4 lakhs, Rs. 5,000 cash aid per month for 2 years, free ration for 2 years and Rs. 1.5 lakhs aid to build their house. The government of Tripura would provide the land under this agreement.

Shri Shah mentioned about how the North East is being put on the track of fast paced development under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi. He talked about the recent surrender of 88 armed insurgents of the NLFT(SD) group and assimilating them into the mainstream. This major step, along with the Bru-Reang agreement today, is important milestones in bringing fast paced development to the State of Tripura. Soon, a lasting peace would be established in the whole of the North East under Prime Minister’s leadership, he added. 

 

Background

In 1997, following ethnic tension, around 5,000 families comprising around 30,000 Bru-Reang tribals were forced to flee Mizoram and seek shelter in Tripura. These people were housed in temporary camps at Kanchanpur, in North Tripura.

Since 2010, Government of India has been making sustained efforts to permanently rehabilitate these refugees. The Union government has been assisting the two State governments for taking the care of the refugees. Till 2014, 1622 Bru-Reang families returned to Mizoram in different batches.  

On 3rd July, 2018, an agreement was signed between the Union government, the two State governments and representatives of Bru-Reang refugees, as a result of which the aid given to these families was increased substantially. Subsequently, 328 families comprising of 1369 individuals returned to Mizoram under the agreement. There had been a sustained demand of most Bru-Reang families that they may be allowed to settle down in Tripura, considering their apprehensions about their security.

                The Union Home Minister, Shri Amit Shah, chaired the sixth meeting of the Island Development Agency (IDA) held here today. The Island Development Agency reviewed the progress made towards the programme “Holistic development of islands”. For the first time in the country, under the guidance of IDA, an initiative of sustainable development in the identified Islands within scientifically-assessed carrying capacity has been taken-up. Development Plans with focus on creation of jobs for the islanders through tourism promotion as well as export of seafood and coconut-based products made in the Islands have been prepared and are being implemented in four islands of Andaman & Nicobar and five islands of Lakshadweep. In the second phase, suitable sites in 12 more islands of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and 5 islands in Lakshadweep have been covered. 

Model tourism projects both Land-based and Water Villas were planned and bids have been invited for private sector participation.As a unique initiative, to spur investment, it was decided to obtain clearances for implementation of the planned projects up-front. All necessary clearances would be in place before bids finalization. Environment and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearances have already been obtained for four exemplary tourism projects of Andaman & Nicobar Islands. 

For strengthening infrastructure support, projects for improving air, sea and digital connectivity are also being implemented. Port Blair and another 7 islands in Andaman & Nicobar would get digitally connected through submarine optical fibre cable by June, 2020. Better communication services would facilitate setting up of Information Technology based and other Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the islands with incentives through Lakshadweep and Andaman & Nicobar Islands Industrial Development Scheme (LANIDS), 2018 notified on 1st January, 2019. The proposed airports in Great Nicobar Island of Andaman & Nicobar and Minicoy Island of Lakshadweep would catalyze the development process in the region. 

In the meeting, a detailed presentation was made by CEO, NITI Aayog highlighting current status of the planned projects being implemented for islanders’ benefits. The status of implementation of decisions taken in the last meeting was also highlighted in the presentation.

He further advised to formulate separate policyfor maintaining a clean, green and healthy environment in the islands. In addition, he advised to implement suitable strategies for sustainable utilization of fisheries resources available in Exclusive Economic Zone around the islands. Adequate technology-based facilities need to be provided to enhance fish collection, storage, processing and export of value-added products which would provide more jobs and generate additional income for the islands.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah, inaugurated the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) and also dedicated National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal to the Nation today.  This state-of-the-art Centre is located in New Delhi.

 



 

The scheme to setup I4C was approved in October 2018 at an estimated cost of Rs. 415.86 crore, to deal with all types of cybercrimes in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. It has seven components viz., National Cyber Crime Threat Analytics Unit, National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, National Cyber Crime Training Centre, Cyber Crime Ecosystem Management Unit, National Cyber Crime Research and Innovation Centre, National Cyber Crime Forensic Laboratory Ecosystem and Platform for Joint Cyber Crime Investigation Team. At the initiative of Union Ministry for Home Affairs (MHA), 15 States and UTs have given their consent to set up Regional Cyber Crime Coordination Centres at respective States/UTs.  

National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (www.cybercrime.gov.in) is a citizen-centric initiative that will enable citizens to report cyber crimes online through the portal.  All the cyber crime related complaints will be accessed by the concerned law enforcement agencies in the States and Union Territories for taking action as per law. This portal was launched on pilot basis on 30th August, 2019 and it enables filing of all cyber crimes with specific focus on crimes against women, children, particularly child pornography, child sex abuse material, online content pertaining to rapes/gang rapes, etc.

So far, more than 700 police districts and more than 3,900 police stations have been connected with this Portal.  After successful completion, this portal can improve the capacity of the law enforcement agencies to investigate the cases and will improve success in prosecution. This portal also focuses on specific crimes like financial crime and social media related crimes like stalking, cyber bullying, etc.  This portal will improve coordination amongst the law enforcement agencies of different States, districts and police stations for dealing with cyber crimes in a coordinated and effective manner. MHA is committed to provide and create an eco system for dealing with the cyber crimes in a comprehensive & coordinated manner.

In future, this portal will provide for chatbot for automated interactive assistance system to the public for guidance on cybercrime prevention and how to report incidents on the portal.

                In furtherance to Government of India’s policy of zero tolerance for crime and in an endeavor to fast track the dispensation of justice, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has taken steps to enhance and streamline the process of international mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. The MHA has issued Revised Guidelines for Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters in December 2019. The revised guidelines can be accessed here. 

The revised guidelines provide step-by-step guidance to the investigation agencies for drafting and processing Letters Rogatory / Mutual Legal Assistance Requests and Service of Summons, Notices & other Judicial Documents. By incorporating various legal and technological developments in the recent years, it aims to make the documentation in this regard more precise and focused as well as compliant with International requirements.   

The guidelines have also taken into account the concerns raised by various courts for prompt and timely responses in service of documents on persons residing abroad. As an initiative, the revised guidelines have provision for service of documents on authorities of foreign country preferably within 10 days of receipt of request in respect of offences committed against women and children. 

Training in mutual legal assistance in criminal matters has also been taken up for investigators, prosecutors and judicial officers. 

The transnational nature of crime and digital explosion has blurred geographical boundaries for criminal activities.  Availability of evidence and criminals outside the sovereign jurisdiction of countries has necessitated the transformation of scope and nature of conventional investigation.  

India has entered into Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties/ Agreements with 42 countries and is signatory to various international conventions i.e. UNCAC, UNTOC etc. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is the designated ‘Central Authority’ for India. Generally, assistance is sought and received in the form of Mutual Legal Assistance Requests/Letters Rogatory and Service of Summons/Notices/Judicial documents on persons residing abroad.  

In order to streamline the process of rendering/ seeking such assistance, MHA had issued  guidelines regarding investigation abroad & issue of Letters Rogatory (LRs) in 2007 & regarding Service of Summons/Notices/ Judicial process on the persons residing abroad in 2009. 

Over the decade, there have been substantial changes in International Cooperation based on new legislations, regulations & conventions and amendment in procedural laws all over the world including India.  These changes necessitated the need for comprehensive review of existing guidelines to keep them abreast the modern era requirements.

                An interfaith delegation met the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy to express solidarity with the government in the times of violent protests and public unrest under the pretext of opposing Citizenship Amendment Act here today. 

The delegation members expressed solidarity with the government and faith in the policies of the government led by  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The delegation unanimously affirmed that the CAA concerns foreigners and no Indian, from whichever religion, caste, color or creed, has anything to fear. Highlighting the principles of Dharma and Ahimsa, the delegation affirmed their belief that the legislation has been passed on humanitarian grounds for those who fled from the three countries fearing persecution and had migrated to India for solace and safety. The delegation said that India being a land of mutual acceptance and harmony; it is unacceptable that one protests against a decision that aims to alleviate the suffering of those uprooted families. The legislation is based on a perfect rationale and objective premise, the members reiterated. 

The delegation further expressed that resilience of Indian democracy lies in the strength of our collectivism, the belief in our principles of non-violence and acceptance and adherence to the principles of the constitution. They reiterated the fact that we all identify ourselves as Indians before anything else and it keeps us together. It is this faith and belief that will keep us together and strong in the face of storm, let loose by forces that do not want to see us united and growing. They urged the people to guard themselves against misinformation meant to destabilize our foundations of mutual respect and acceptance.

As a symbolic gesture of religious harmony and peace, the delegation wished to reach out to the people with this message of Ahimsa and religious harmony. They also expressed their desire to meet the Union Home Minister and the Prime Minister with this message of peace and solidarity.

The delegation comprised of prominent spiritual gurus and social reformers from different faiths and sects, including Jain Acharya Dr. Lokeshji, Meditation guru Swami Deepankar ji, Mufti Shamoon Qasmi ji, Sardar Sant Singh ji, Veer Chakra Awardee Col, T.P. Tyagi Ji, Vineet Kumar Ji and Gautam Ji.

                ""A 'Karmayoddha' is man with a beating heart for people, a statesman, a hard task master, an able administrator and an ideal leader who leads by example. All these qualities have been personified by Shri Narendra Modi"", said Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah while releasing a book ‘Karmayoddha Granth’, on the life of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, in New Delhi today.

 




Shri Shah talked about the three parts of PM's life starting from the phase of dedicating his life to an ideology; entering politics on the ideals of the sangathan; and finally, upholding the tenets of Parliamentary Democracy and the Constitution of India to construct an ideal State. Today, PM has transformed into a global leader without accreting anything for himself. Shri Narendra Modi is the epitome of selfless service to the Nation, he said.


Talking about the journey of his life, Home Minister said that Modiji saw a childhood devoid of luxury, full of poverty, disadvantages and neglect from society transformed into a leader who dedicated his life towards the welfare of the people, without keeping any ill-feeling for anyone in the society. He further said that Modiji resurrected the Gujarat BJP organization from scratch and transformed it into a living organism that brought an ideology which was dedicated to service of the people into party politics, Shri Shah added.


The Home Minister narrated the challenges faced by Shri Modi, from natural calamities to social upheavals, while he was the CM of Gujarat and how he surmounted each one of them to transform the state by creating the ‘Gujarat model’, an example of equitable development and growth. Shri Modi laid the foundation of the New India based on 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', from Gujarat. He brought the concept of 'Jan Samvad' in good governance, which was above partisan politics. The people of India recognised the Gujarat model of development and chose Modiji as the fit candidate to lead the Nation.


Shri Shah noted that the Modi government inherited a governance setup that was plagued with corruption of more than Rs. 12 lakh crores and from 2014, corruption worth not even a penny was allowed to take place in this government. On the other hand, he recounted the initiatives taken by Modi government for 60 crore poor people of the country and said that in the last 5 years, 13 crore people got LPG connections, 99% of homes got electricity, almost every household has toilets and Universal health care worth Rs. 5 lakhs under Ayushman Bharat benefitting 50 crore people, among others. Working on the Antyodaya ideology, the Modi government is committed to give houses for everyone by 2022 and piped drinking water for everyone by 2024, he added.

 




Shri Shah said that the Modi goverment has worked in the direction of destroying stereotypes - Neta vs Babu, Rural vs Urban development and Industrial vs Agricultural development. This government has ensured equitable growth and development in all sectors, he added.

Talking about building a strong image of India globally, Shri Shah said that Modiji revamped India's Foreign policy and National Security policy by delinking the two. India emerged as a strong Nation on the global front while making its stance clear that India would not take attacks on itself lying down. India has emerged as a global power by taking bold decisions, including removal of Article 370, 35A in J&K, bringing Citizenship Amendment Act 2019, resolution of Ram Mandir issue, criminalising Triple Talaq, conducting surgical strikes and Balakote airstrikes, which nobody dared in last 70 years, he said.


The Home Minister talked about the three curses of Indian politics that Modiji removed after 2014 which included appeasement politics, casteism and nepotism. He said that this government works on efficiency and by keeping welfare of the people as the guiding principle, rather than vote bank politics. India has for long not seen a leader before Shri Modi taking strong decisions, in interest of the Nation and its people, without fearing backlash. He has also worked to bring recognition to Indian languages mainly Hindi around the world, Shri Shah concluded.

Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah laid foundation stone of The Delhi CycleWalk at Tughlakabad, New Delhi today.  Present on the occasion were Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs and Civil Aviation and Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Shri Hardeep Singh Puri and Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Shri Anil Baijal. 

 



 

Referring about the benefits of the proposed CycleWalk, Shri Shah said that it would reduce air pollution of New Delhi by at least 20% and added that green commuting will now be possible in New Delhi. He also said that this move will usher in an era where green transportation like cycles will become fashionable and would be widely used. He added that the 200 km CycleWalk will also give an impetus to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's vision of ‘Fit India’. 

 

Shri Shah noted that roughly 11 lakh people commute on bicycles in New Delhi at present, and efforts should be made to increase this number to 50 lakh cycle commuters, which would make a major difference in Delhi's traffic and pollution levels. He suggested that DDA should establish cycle clubs and encourage the use of cycles by all citizens, especially college-going youngsters. 

 

Speaking on the Ayushmann Bharat scheme, Shri Shah asserted that it is a far superior scheme than any other existing Government health scheme, and expressed disappointment that the poor of Delhi are not able to reap the benefits of it as Delhi Government is not implementing the same.  He commented on the quality of drinking water in Delhi, and said that it is not fit for drinking, and that there is an urgent need to improve the same. He said that promises made by Delhi Government to provide CCTVs, free Wi-Fi and colleges have still not been fulfilled. Shri Shah said that Municipal Corporations have performed the developmental mandate, despite roadblocks.

 



 

Shri Shah asserted that the regularization of unauthorized colonies had happened because of the vision and boldness of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, and the move would benefit 40 lakh people residing in over 1700 colonies. He added that the pilot project for the same had already begun. 

 

Speaking on the recently passed Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Shri Shah said that it was a humanitarian law that would benefit persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He added that the opposition was misleading the country's minority on the issue and was creating an environment of fear. He asserted that CAA will not take away anyone's citizenship, instead it enables the persecuted to be eligible for citizenship.

 

Shri Shah said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's courageous decision to repeal Articles 370 and 35A had led to Jammu and Kashmir now being an integral part of India and now the tricolor is flying high in Jammu and Kashmir.

                The National Human Rights Commission, NHRC, India has taken suo motu cognizance of media reports about the death of more than 100 children at a government run hospital in Kota district of Rajasthan in the month of December, 2019. Ten out of hundred children died within 48 hours between December 23 and 24, 2019. Reportedly, over 50 per cent of the gadgets installed in the hospital are defunct and the hospital is lacking cleanliness and basic infrastructure including oxygen supply in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

The Commission has issued a notice to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan to submit a detailed report, within four weeks in the matter including the steps being taken to address the issue and to ensure that such deaths of the children do not recur in future due to lack of infrastructure and health facilities at the hospitals.

                Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah dedicated to the Nation the new campus of the National Fire Service College (NFSC) in Nagpur, today. The Home Minister presented Fire Service Gallantry Medals and awards to meritorious students of the NFSC during the event. Further, he also laid the foundation of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) Academy at Nagpur. Shri Shah also announced Subhash Chandra Bose Award in the field of Disaster Management.



 
Shri Shah paid tributes to the martyred fire services officers and talked about how Modi government has given importance to institutionalise the capacity building in the field of Fire Services and National Disaster Management by building dedicated institutions like NFSC and NDRF Academy, which have been neglected for the past 70 years.  He expressed hope that though fire services is a State subject, all States would have a better coordination with the Centre to fight fire disasters through the NFSC. The Minister added that the government has allocated over Rs. 200 crores for the modernisation of the NFSC. He talked about the short and long term courses that would be run in this institution.

The Home Minister expressed pride that due to sustained efforts of Modi government since 2016, NDRF has emerged as the leading disaster management force globally and it has achieved all benchmarks under Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Shri Shah said the Nation came a long way over the last two decades in its response to disasters and improved its capabilities in minimising losses of human lives and damage to the economy. He cited the Odisha super cyclone in 1999 in which more than 10,000 people had died, in comparison to the recent cyclone ‘Fani’ that claimed 64 lives, which reflected the huge capabilities built in Disaster Response mechanisms. In the other words, in a little over a decade, India has been able to reduce the loss of lives to less than 1% in the comparisons to that of past, he said.

 




Shri Shah talked about the steps taken by Modi government for optimization of disaster management resources at the district level. He acknowledged the efforts of NDRF being the first responder during disasters in our neighbouring countries and how it is getting accolades for India from its neighbours. Shri Shah further said that India has become the hub for training disaster management personnel in the SAARC region and expressed hope that this will facilitate exchange of best practices and minimise the effects of disasters on the people. Further, he said that India needs to prepare itself to efficiently fight disasters and make the infrastructure disaster resilient for achieving the target of $5 trillion economy in near future.

 



 

Addressing on the occasion, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Nityanand Rai talked about the challenges faced by firemen during fire emergencies and how the NFSC would be an important building block in preparing able fire services personnel in the future. He detailed the steps taken by the MHA, under the leadership of Prime Minister and Home Minister, by issuing advisories to State governments for establishing efficient response mechanism during disasters and better preparing the people and service personnel, by conducting mock drills to minimise losses of life and property.

Also present on the occasion were Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Shri Nitin Gadkari, along with other senior officers of Union and State governments.

Sharing his love for the legendary filmmaker, Dutch Animation Film Maker and Academy Award winner, Michael Dudok de Wit said: “I remember watching the film Appu Trilogy; it was so emotional and beautiful.

                Directors of ‘Son Rise’ and Shevanti, both MIFF films in the National Competition section, interacted with the media, at Films Division in Mumbai today.

National Award Winner, Director (Son Rise) Vibha Bakshi and Director (Shevanti), Nilesh Kunjir met the media for a press conference post screening of their films at MIFF today.
“How does an ordinary farmer defy society by marrying a gang-rape survivor and work towards getting her justice? Haryana is India's seat of patriarchy but this is also where heroes who support women are born,"" said Vibha Bakshi, speaking about her experience of shooting in Haryana. “We found ordinary men who are doing the extraordinary to change patriarchal attitudes; our heroes - all from Haryana - are an example for our men. Hope that our film inspires men to stand united with women in addressing gender issues.” 



Son Rise, a non-feature documentary, based in rural Haryana, shows how ordinary men can do extraordinary things. The film won a National Award for Best Non-Feature and Best Editing in Non-Feature. ""The editing took place over a period of 8 months and Hemanti Sarkar is the best editor in the country,"" she added. 

Shevanti is a short film based on the life of a married couple and how relationships evolve over time. The film is based on a short story written by the Marathi writer, Chandrashekhar Gokhale. “I chose to make this film because I loved the storyline and opted to make this film without dialogues. I felt it could be more effective through visuals” said Director, Nilesh Kunjir. The film has been officially selected for Asian Film Festival. Upon being asked how he is able to depict female characters so well in his writings, Chandrasekhar Gokhale said, ""I give all credits to my mother who was very expressive, which taught me to understand a woman’s emotions.”

                The Dr. V Shantaram Lifetime Achievement Award of the 16th edition of Mumbai International Film Festival for Documentary, Shorts & Animation Films – MIFF 2020 has been awarded to veteran documentary film maker Dr. S. Krishnaswamy, for his lifelong invaluable contribution to non-fiction filmmaking. 



The Chief Guest for the opening ceremony, Union Minister of State for Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Shri Babul Supriyo and the Guest of Honour, Minister for Cultural Affairs & Medical Education, Government of Maharashtra, Shri Amit Vilasrao Deshmukh presented the award to Dr. Krishnaswamy. Noted filmmaker Shri Kiran Shantaram was also present on the occasion.

Receiving the award, the lifetime achievement awardee said:” It is very difficult for the voice to come up when you are on cloud nine. It is a great privilege to receive this award from the documentary film making fraternity and from Films Division. It is a great pleasure also to receive this award from Union Minister Shri Supriyo and the State Minister Shri Deshmukh. I am speaking from my heart. I made a four-hour film on Indian history, after working on it for almost fifteen years, with no financial backing. It traces the history of India from more than 5,000 years ago to 1976, I titled the film as From Indus Valley to Indira Gandhi I could not find anyone to distribute the film, until Warner Brothers came to my rescue, transforming it from complete failure to complete success. I have never accepted to make a single film in which I did not believe. Over time, I have developed a philosophy where one remembers what one plans and wants to achieve. It is a privilege to have V. Shantaram’s son with us to represent the great tradition and bestow me with this honour.”



He further reminisced: When my film From Indus Valley to Indira Gandhi was released in 1976, I was attending the world premiere of my film. At the end of that show, I got a message that the Indian Parliament was discussing my film that day for forty minutes. I sent a message to the then I&B Minister Shri L. K. Advani, expressing my gratitude for the discussion on the film, but also saying that it would have been more beneficial for the parliamentarians to watch some portion of my film. A leader of stature, Shri Advani organized a show for himself and for some of his colleagues. Later, he told me that I have done a great film.” Shri Krishnaswamy expressed his gratitude to Films Division, the Government of India and to the film industry for the award.

One of India’s senior most and active filmmakers who made socially relevant documentaries, Dr. S. Krishnaswamy has more than 200 non-fiction films to his credit and a dozen television serials. His 18-episode television serial Indian Imprints on the impact of ancient India over South East Asia, telecast on Doordarshan in 2009, had received an overwhelming response.
His four-hour-long film tracing the 5,000 years of art, culture, history and heritage of India on celluloid was distributed by Warner Brothers in 1976 which received global attention. His documentaries have covered a wide range of subjects including industry, agriculture, electoral reforms and biographies of multifarious personalities.

Recipient of many coveted awards, including the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2009 and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the US International Film & Video Festival, Los Angeles, Dr. S. Krishnaswamy is also well known for the pioneering book Indian Film which he co-authored with Erik Barnouw in 1963. His recent book An Unlikely Chemistry: Autobiography of a Couple, helps understand modern India.  

Dr. S. Krishnaswamy is the son of K. Subramaniam, the legendary filmmaker who played a key role behind the establishment of the Tamil film industry. He completed his graduation in Physics in Madras and got enrolled in a diploma course of the British Institute of Radio Engineers, London. After graduation, he joined Columbia University to pursue a course on films and film making, where he met Professor Erik Barnouw, the co-author of his book ‘Indian Film’.

The prestigious Dr. V Shantaram Lifetime Achievement Award is presented in every edition of MIFF, to a filmmaker for seminal contribution to documentary films and its movement in India. It carries a cash award of 10 lakh rupees, trophy and a citation. Shyam Benegal, Vijaya Mulay and Anand Patwardhan are a few of the veteran film makers who had been bestowed with the award in previous years. The award is instituted in memory of legendary filmmaker V Shantaram, who was closely associated with Films Division as Honorary Chief Producer during the 1950s.

Addressing the gathering of dignitaries, diplomats, filmmakers and film personalities from India and abroad, jury and selection committee members, senior officials, media students, journalists and film lovers, the Chief Guest and Union Minister Shri Babul Supriyo said: “We have great enlightened minds gathered here, who are doing to make great documentary films in the coming years.” The Minister congratulated film makers and said: “When you make documentaries and short films, you talk about the rich cinematic history, which is a form of fixed deposit. It is also about the rich history which interests and inspires generations to come. I congratulate the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting for organizing the festival, and showcasing the diverse talent and their work. I assure you that the Government of India under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is very unbiased and open-hearted in respecting and honouring talent and enriching this form of art.” 



The Minister stated that it is only if one believes in oneself and the idea that one can succeed in the film industry. “I am very proud that iconic films of legendary filmmakers such as Satyajit Ray are presented at this edition of MIFF. I wish I could come back again to watch Rabindranath Tagore and Pikoo. I am also excited to know about some of the many highlights of this edition which includes a special package of films from European Union, Animation package from Russia, Finland and Balkan. Oscar nominated films such as Fauve, Detainment and Night at the Garden would also be screened while Ireland will showcase its best documentaries in the Country Focus section.”

The Minister further said: 

“It was in 1948 that the pre-independence ‘Information Films of India’ gave way to transform itself into what we know today as ‘Films Division’. What is remarkable about Films Division is its contribution to the documentary culture in the country as it has always strived to promote and nurture the documentary film, which is one of the most important mediums of audio-visual storytelling. One of the avenues through which it has cemented its position as an influential force in the world of documentary is through MIFF.

The number of films being screened at MIFF has only increased and more and more young documentary film makers are looking at MIFF as a platform for exposure and engagement with documentary practices from around the world. It is the documentary film that sheds light on the socio-cultural structures and dynamics of different societies like no other. Young filmmakers can now set out with a digital camera to realize their dreams and MIFF is always waiting round the corner to provide them a platform for outreach.”

The Minister congratulated Dr. S. Krishnaswamy for winning the V. Shantaram Lifetime Achievement Award at MIFF 2020.  He said he is sure that his body of work will truly inspire the younger story-tellers not just in India but across the globe. He also extended his best wishes to all the participating filmmakers, film lovers, jury members, selection committee members and the organizing team for an eventful and successful weak ahead.

The Guest of Honour and Maharashtra State Minister Shri Amit Vilasrao Deshmukh said: “Films Division, which has been the defining force in the documentary film movement in India since 1948, has made possible the dream of documentary film making for many Indian youngsters. It had the vision of establishing MIFF as one of the most sought-after cultural events of the country. MIFF has steadily grown in stature over the years and is one of the best organized documentary film festivals in the world. The best minds in the documentary film movement will gather in Mumbai during the coming days. I congratulate Films Division and the Ministry of I&B for making MIFF a roaring success. Hope the 16th edition will not only be a new experience, but also inspire you to watch films which will be screened in future editions of MIFF”. Speaking on the changes in the industry, the Minister said the sector faces challenges and encouraged the audience to deal with the challenges and take the industry to greater heights. 



Welcoming the gathering to the 16th edition of the festival, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India, Shri Atul Kumar Tiwari said that the festival will showcase the best documentaries, short fiction films and animation films drawn from all over the world and will also have engaging sessions. “The Government of India has always been extending support in strengthening the documentary film movement. Films Division has been contributing to this movement, as well as towards preserving the rich cinematic history of India. The non-feature genre got a boost in 1990 with the birth of MIFF. MIFF today is one of the best international platforms for non-feature films and filmmakers. MIFF, in a small and impactful way, tries to the rise to the occasion of making positive impact on society. MIFF has gone mobile this year, with a mobile app which provides all information and updates on the festival.”



President, Indian Documentary Producers’ Association (IDPA), Ms. Usha Deshpande said: “IDPA has been a partner in MIFF right from the beginning. We organize workshops, panel discussions and master classes and also present an award for the best student film. This year, in collaboration with Films Division, we are helping organize special screenings on college campuses. We also try to explore problems and solutions faced by the documentary film industry. The documentary film industry fulfills a very important mission, we deserve wide support in taking forward this movement.”

Addressing and welcoming the gathering, MIFF festival director and Director General, Films Division, Ms. Smita Vats Sharma said: “Documentary films hold a mirror to society and play a crucial role in documenting heritage, history and values of a nation and its people. With this mission in mind MIFF, was conceptualized as a platform to showcase the best in non-fiction filmmaking. MIFF has grown in stature from year to year. The 16th edition is here with more energy and passion.”

The Festival Director spoke of the various attractions of MIFF 2020, including special film packages and workshops, master classes and special film screenings at college campuses. She said that the National Museum of Indian Cinema, inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India in January 2019 and housed in the Films Division premises, adds another unforgettable dimension to the festival.

The Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar, today conferred the First Antarrashtriya Yoga Diwas to 30 media organizations, at an event in National Media Centre, New Delhi. 

 

Addressing the gathering, Shri Javadekar described the award as a unique honour to media organizations that contributed to the spread of Yoga for the benefit of society. Appreciating the efforts of various media organizations, the Minister said that this event, the first of its kind, also marks a new trend of recognition of the endeavour of media organizations that go beyond news, views and advertisements, and work in mission mode for the larger benefit of society. 

 

Shri Javadekar recalled that Lokmanya Tilak had launched the newspaper “Kesari” as a medium to generate awareness towards “Swarajya”. Today, he said, media organizations are creating greater public awareness towards “Suraaj” – where good healthcare, education, and civic amenities are available to all. He described this as a sign of India’s mature democracy. 

 

Shri Javadekar described Yoga as the biggest key to preventive healthcare. Shri Javadekar mentioned that Yoga – an Indian brand – has gained global respect due to the vision and efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He recalled that the United Nations supported with overwhelming majority, India’s proposal for an International Day of Yoga. The Minister congratulated and thanked both the awardees and the Jury members.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik, congratulated the I&B Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar for the successful conduct of this new initiative of Yoga Diwas Media Samman. He described Yoga as an ancient heritage of our civilization, through which one can attain mental and physical well-being.

 

In his address, the Chairman of the Jury, and Chairman, Press Council of India, Justice C.K. Prasad, described Yoga as an investment with zero risk and considerable benefit. Earlier, in his welcome address, Shri Vikram Sahay, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said that these awards are an attestation of the strong belief in the freedom of press, and the crucial role which media plays in disseminating information and creating awareness among the people on various aspects of social and public life. 

 

Secretary, Information and Broadcasting, Shri Ravi Mittal, Additional Secretary Shri Atul Tiwari, and several other senior officials of the Ministries of I&B, and AYUSH, were present on the occasion.

Brief on International Day of Yoga

The International Day of Yoga has been celebrated annually on 21 June since 2015. The idea of International Day of Yoga was first proposed by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, during his address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), on 27 September 2014.

While proposing the idea the Prime Minister stated: 

“Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help in well being. Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day.”

Following this initial proposal, the UNGA held informal consultations on the draft resolution, entitled ""International Day of Yoga"", on 14 October 2014. The consultations were convened by the delegation of India.On 11 December 2014, India's Permanent Representative introduced the draft resolution in the United Nations General Assembly. The draft text received broad support from 177 Member States who sponsored the text, which was adopted without a vote. This initiative found support from most global leaders. A total of 177 nations co-sponsored the resolution, which is the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any UNGA resolution of such nature.

                The Union Minister for Jal Shakti, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat inaugurated the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) national review and workshop here today. The workshop also included a special interaction with Sadhguru, founder of Isha Foundation. The daylong workshop began with a session by the Minister and Sadhguru in the morning, and was then followed by a review chaired by the Cabinet Secretary in the afternoon. In attendance were senior officials from the Government of India who have been implementing the Jal Shakti Abhiyan in the most water stressed districts across the country along with district administrations.

The Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) is managed by the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, in collaboration with key Departments of the central government working in the water conservation sector, along with state governments, for an integrated approach to accelerate the programmatic implementation of water conservation interventions. The campaign has since delivered a significant increase in water conservation awareness, related infrastructure and even certain outcomes of groundwater replenishing across 256 water stressed districts, as recorded by line departments and the office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister.

In the morning session, Sadhguru shared the scalable initiatives for water conservation being undertaken by the Isha Foundation and spoke of experiences with regard to the people’s movement the campaigns have witnessed in recent years. He highlighted the need for a sustainable approach towards nation building and the need to identify ways to conserve water at the local level.

During the interaction, Shri Shekhawat congratulated all the officials for working with full commitment as Jal Yodhhas or Water Warriors under JSA to bring about a visible change on the ground with significant outcomes already being recorded. He referred to the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech on 15th August 2019 with regard to water resource management, which has evoked the jan andolan to conserve water and ensure its effective usage across the country.

As part of the Cabinet Secretary’s review in the afternoon, the Cabinet Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba lauded the efforts and commitment of the officers in making JSA a people’s movement and urged them to continue the momentum with the same spirit and commitment. The Cabinet Secretary also released a “Report on Jal Shakti Abhiyan- Outcomes and Learning” during the review.

Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, DDWS, elaborated on the massive transformation and awareness generation on water conservation achieved under JSA campaign and shared the progress update under the five key interventions of the programme: (1) water conservation and rainwater harvesting; (2) renovation of tradition water bodies/tanks; (3) reuse and borewell recharge structures; (4) watershed development; and (5) intensive afforestation.

The Principal Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister, Prof. K Vijay Raghavan highlighted the key outcomes and scientific tools used during the campaign, including satellite-based mapping and analysis, survey tools, and mobile Applications (Bhuvan-ISRO) for tracking the activities undertaken for increasing groundwater levels.

A short film on the spirit of the JSA and showcasing achievements of the Abhiyan implemented at the grassroots level was screened on the occasion.

                The magnificent tableau of the Ministry of Jal Shakti, highlighting the Government’s new initiative ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’ which aims at providing Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) to every rural household by 2024, has been adjudged the best tableau, jointly with the NDRF tableau. Defence Minister Shri Rajnath Singh awarded the best tableau award to the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) tableau in a gracious and befitting ceremony here today. This marvellous tableau depicting the HarGhar Jal vision of the Prime Minister, was one of the central attraction of this year’s Republic Day Parade.  

In his Independence Day address, last year the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi announced launch of Jal Jeevan Mission to provide potable water in adequate quantity and prescribed quality on regular basis to every rural household by 2024. Currently, only 33 million out of around 178 million rural households in the country have facility of piped water connection and hence approximately 146 million households are to provided with household tap connections by 2024 under JJM.

The winner tableau’s front design was in the shape of a huge metallic tap and a pot made of metallic pots, representing millions of rural households. The middle section showcased how a rural household in ‘New India’ benefits under JJM. A household was shown with the facility of running water (in kitchen, toilet, washing area), grey-water flowing into a soak pit, izzatghar (toilet). The family was shown attending to its daily routine with improved quality of life. The rear portion showcased water conservation in the form of a structure that looks like two palms collecting a huge water drop, indicating collective efforts for rainwater harvesting and water conservation. There were artists donned in droplets costumes in blue and cultural attire of different states/UTs walking along symbolizing the making of JJM, a Jan Andolan.

Overall the tableau confirmed the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for water conservation and accessibility of quality water for all urging rural communities to work together so that water becomes a shared commitment and has to become “everyone’s business’. In the Prime Minister’s words, “for long term drinking water security, it is important that local communities and Gram Panchayats come forward and take responsibility to manage in-village water supply systems and their water resources; and reuse greywater. The community must have a sense of ownership of the assets being created under this Mission.”

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for the proposal of the Legislative Department for allowing the Election Commission to enter into Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with the Independent High Authority for Elections of Tunisia (ISIE) and the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission(PNGEC) for elections for cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration. 

Impact:

The MOUs would promote bilateral cooperation, aimed at building technical assistance/ capacity support for the Independent High Authority for Elections of Tunisia (ISIE) and the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission(PNGEC) for elections for cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration, envisaging cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration and providing a leg-up to such bodies in conducting elections in their respective countries. This would also result in bolstering India's international relations.

Background

The Election Commission has been participating in promoting cooperation in the field of election matters and electoral processes across the world with certain foreign countries and agencies by adopting the mode of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the concerned parties. The Election Commission, a constitutional body, conducts the largest electoral exercise in the world. It is the responsibility of the Election Commission to organise free and fair elections in the country of about 85 crore voters with diverse socio-political and economic backgrounds. In recent years, the role being played by the Election Commission ensures greater participation of people in political affairs. India, today, is considered as the world's 'largest' democratic country. The success of democracy in India has attracted the attention of almost every political system around the world.

In its pursuit of excellence, the Election Commission has been receiving various proposals from foreign electoral bodies for developing bilateral relations in the field of election and matters connected therewith. The Election Commission forwarded a proposal to the Ministry of Law and Justice, Legislative Department relating to signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by it with the Election Commission of Maldives on cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration.

These MoUs contain standard articles/clauses which broadly express promotion of cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration including promotion of exchange of knowledge and experience in the field of organizational and technical development of electoral process; support in exchanging information, institutional strengthening and capacity building, training of personnel, holding regular consultations; etc.

                Incidents of rape and gang rape of minor girls below age of twelve years and similar heinous crimes against women have shaken the conscience of the entire nation. Therefore, the offences of rape and gang rape of women and children require effective deterrence through fast and time bound completion of trial relating to sexual offences. To bring out more stringent provisions and expeditious trial and disposal of such cases, Union of India enacted the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018.

The has taken up work of setting up of Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) as a part of National Mission for Safety of Women (NMSW). Accordingly, the Central Government has started a Scheme for setting up of 1023 FTSCs across the country based on pendency of subject cases obtained from various High Courts (1,66,882 numbers as on 31.03.2018) for time bound trial and disposal of pending cases related to rape and POCSO Act.  Further, in pursuance to the direction of Supreme Court of India in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Criminal) No.01/2019 dated 25.07.2019, out of 1023 FTSCs, 389 Courts have been proposed to be set up exclusively for POCSO Act related cases in Districts where pendency of such cases is more than 100. The Scheme was circulated to all concerned State Governments/ Union Territories Administrations in September, 2019. Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister of Law and Justice has written and appealed to all the Chief Ministers of States for opening these courts and for effective implementation of the Scheme which will act as strong deterrence against such crimes.   

 

Out of total 31 States and UTs, so far, 24 have joined this scheme (Andhara Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, NCT of Delhi, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, UT of Chandigarh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh) for setting up of 792 numbers of FTSCs/ including 354 exclusive POCSO courts. Efforts are constantly being made to obtain consent/willingness of remaining States/UTs.

 

The Department of Justice in the Government of India is constantly endeavoring to extend requisite assistance to the High Courts and State Governments in setting up of these Courts for prompt trial and disposal of cases to ensure safe and worth living environment especially to women and children in totality. 216 numbers of POCSO courts have already been operationalized in 12 States under the scheme.

                On the occasion of Martyrs’ Day, paying tribute on the 72nd death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Union Minister for MSME, Shri Nitin Gadkari, launched the limited edition of Khadi wrist watches in New Delhi today. The Minister of State MSME, Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries, Shri Pratap Chandra Sarangi, Chairman KVIC Shri Vinai Kumar Saxena and CEO Titan Shri Ravi Kant were present.

Designed by Titan, a non-horological material like Khadi has been used on the dial and strap of the watches for the first time ever. Since Khadi is handwoven, every single watch in this collection is unique because of the distinctive weave and texture. The straps of the watches have also been treated with a special coating to make them more durable without compromising on its authentic texture. The collection is a unique and elegant blend of simplicity and modernity.

Speaking on the occasion Shri Gadkari said, “This collection celebrates Khadi, India’s signature fabric. Titan and KVIC have come together to create a modern watch that celebrates the fabric which is integral to our Indian heritage. Khadi and a watch were two integral parts of Mahatma Gandhi’s life and I’m really glad to see KVIC & Titan collaborating to pay a true tribute to Gandhi ji. With this extraordinary initiative, Khadi will find its way on the wrists of the modern young Indian. I am sure this will lead to a bright future to the artisans in our economy.”

In his address, Shri Vinai Kumar Saxena said, “Khadi is one of the most eco-friendly materials with zero carbon footprint and requires least water consumption. Together with Titan, we have created beautiful contemporary timepieces that are truly special for the generations to keep by using authentic Khadi.”

The watches are available in two variants (men and women) and are priced at Rs. 4,995/. The collection is exclusively available online at https://www.titan.co.in/.

Speaking on the occasion of the launch, Shri Ravi Kant said that Khadi is revered in India and worldwide due to its uniqueness of being hand spun, handwoven and is truly a sustainable fabric. He said that we are happy to launch this special edition Khadi collection in collaboration with KVIC to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and on the occasion of his martyrdom day.

                In the recent days, Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has taken various initiatives for protection and promotion of Khadi as a brand in India and internationally and are the registered proprietors of over a hundred trademarks registrations including the symbol of ‘Charkha’ in India and other countries like Russia, China, Germany, Australia, UK and Bhutan. These trademark and symbols, however have been misused time and again by private players for material benefits. In an initiative to prevent such misuse any further, for the first time KVIC has taken up the matter with the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Commerce and Permanent Mission of India at UN, Geneva seeking International Trademark protection of symbol of ‘Charkha’ under the article 6ter of the Paris Convention.

Article 6ter of the Paris Convention for the protection of Industrial property of 1883 (1967 Stockholm Act) protects armorial bearings, flags and other State emblems as well as official signs and hallmarks of the States party to the Paris Convention. The signs published with World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) under this act are prevented from being registered or used as trademarks, across the world, without authorization. Quite noticeably, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been endorsing Khadi and due to his appeals the sale of Khadi has gone up manifolds.

Speaking about the initiative, Chairman KVIC Shri VK Saxena said, “KVIC is one of those unique institutions in India that links the nation’s past, present and future on its functional plane, through – self-reliance and sustainability. Ever since the pre-independent era, Khadi has been considered as the national symbol for Swadeshi. The word marks ""KHADI"", ""KUTIR"", ""SARVODAYA"" and the logo of Khadi India and Charkha are the harbinger of this spirit of Swadeshi, hence, must be protected at all cost”. 

Considering historical and national importance of the trademarks, Shri Saxena has written to Commerce Minister Shri Piyush Goyal seeking his intervention so as to expedite the matter pending with the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) which comes under the Ministry of Commerce.

KVIC is fighting cases in several countries for violation of the Khadi Mark Regulations. The regulations issued in 2013 by the Ministry of MSME, empowered KVIC to grant ‘Khadi Mark’ registration and take royalties from any producer using the Khadi Mark. In continuation, KVIC has issued notices against 600 entities in India, including a renowned garment chain and 3 entities in the International market for misusing these symbols and indulging in unfair trade practices in the recent past.

                In line with the suggestions of Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Shri Nitin Gadkari on December 17, 2019 while launching sale of ‘Khadi Rumal’ being stitched by militancy affected women of Jammu and Kashmir (at Nagrota near Jammu), Chairman KVIC, Shri VK Saxena has approved the enhancement of wages from Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 per piece w.e.f. 1st Jan 2020. 

Quite noticeably, each women artisan at Nagrota used to earn around Rs. 170 - Rs. 200 stitching 85-90 Khadi Rumals on an average working 4 hours per day. Now with revised wages, each woman will earn around Rs. 250 – Rs. 300 per day, thus increasing their income by around 50%. Since the launch on 17th December 2019, approximately 30,000 Khadi Rumals have been sold by Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC). Nagrota a centre has been established by KVIC to provide employment to local women.

Highlighting this as a major step towards nation building, Chairman KVIC, Shri VK Saxena said, “Since the inception of this training center, the intention of KVIC has been to promote ‘Khadi Rumal’ and contribute meaningfully to the families of militancy affected areas of J&K. Currently the stitching center has a production capacity of 10,000 ‘Khadi Rumals’ per day stitched by 130 women artisans.”

Speaking about the initiative, Shri VK Saxena said, “‘Khadi Rumal’ is a symbol of trust that the women in militancy affected areas residing in Nagrota, have on the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Modi, who is working towards ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’. Currently we have been able to employ 130 women and as the sale of Khadi Rumal increases, we plan to reach out and empower 4000 women of this area.”

White Khadi Rumal, made of pure cotton, is being sold across various Khadi outlets in India. To increase the outreach and availability of these Rumals PayTM has agreed to sell 2 Crore pieces of ‘Khadi Rumals’ with the help of its online platforms.

Outlining the impact potential of this initiative, Saxena said, “We have targeted to sell 5 Crore pieces of Khadi Rumal by 2020. To create 5 Crore pieces of Khadi Rumal, around 15 Lakh Kg’s of cotton will be consumed and it will require 25 lakh man-days of spinning, 12.5 lakh man-days of weaving and around 7.5 lakh man-days for cutting, stitching and packaging of Rumals. Thus creating 44 lakh man-days of livelihood, yielding wages amounting to Rs. 88 Crores for various artisans”, Saxena said.

“A humble contribution of the citizens of India could be a stepping stone for the beginning of the ‘Journey of Transformation’. Branded handkerchiefs in the market costs somewhere around Rs. 100-200 per piece, whereas fine quality Khadi Rumal cost just Rs. 50. I call upon every Indian to try a piece of Khadi Rumal and experience the unparalleled feeling of patriotism it instills”, Saxena further said.

                In a historic initiative taken by Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), a first Silk Processing Plant was inaugurated today at Surendranagar in Gujarat which would help cut down the cost of production of silk yarn drastically and increase the sale and availability of raw material for Gujarati Patola Sarees locally. The plant has been set up by a khadi institution at a cost of Rs 75 lack in which KVIC has contributeed Rs 60 lakh. The unit has employed 90 local women, 70 of which belong to the Muslim community.



Patola, the trademark Saree of Gujarat, is considered to be very costly and worn only by the Royals or the Aristocrat. Reason being the raw material silk yarn is purchased from Karnataka or West Bengal, where silk processing units are situated, thus increasing the cost of the fabric manifolds.

Chairman, KVIC Shri V. K. Saxena said that cocoons will be brought from Karnataka and West Bengal and Silk yarn will be processed in house, thus reducing the cost of production and giving a major boost to the sale of famous Gujarati Patola Sarees. Surendranagar district is a backward district in Gujarat where KVIC has invested Rs. 60 Lakhs to build the Silk Processing Plant, in order to generate livelihood and boost sales of Patola Sarees by making silk more ready available at a low cost, for the Patola Saree manufacturers in the nearby area.

Traditionally, every region in India has had its own unique weave for the Silk Saree. It is quite notable that Patola Silk Saree is amongst the top five silk weaves which are desired in every Indian Saree Lover's wardrobe.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said at Lucknow  that our constitutional federal system of governance is the guarantee of “Unity in Diversity”. 

While speaking on the topic of “Enhancing Focus of Legislators on Legislative Business” at the 7th Conference of CPA India Region at Vidhan Bhawan, Lucknow today, Shri Naqvi said that while on one hand in our Constitution; the Article 105 ensures powers and privileges of the Parliament and Assemblies, on the other hand the Article 51A talks about the Fundamental Duties of the Indian Citizens. 

The Article 105 says- Powers, privileges, etc of the Houses of Parliament and of the members and committees thereof

(1) Subject to the provisions of this constitution and the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of Parliament, there shall be freedom of speech in Parliament

(2) No member of Parliament shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by him in Parliament or any committee thereof, and no person shall be so liable in respect of the publication by or under the authority of either House of Parliament of any report, paper, votes or proceedings

(3) In other respects, the powers, privileges and immunities of each House of Parliament, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as may from time to time be defined by Parliament by law, and, until so defined shall be those of that House and of its members and committees immediately before the coming into force of Section 15 of the Constitution (Forty fourth Amendment) Act 1978

(4) The provisions of clauses ( 1 ), ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) shall apply in relation to persons who by virtue of this constitution have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of, a House of Parliament or any committee thereof as they apply in relation to members of Parliament. Almost there is the same situation in the Assemblies also. 

Shri Naqvi said that the Article 51A of the Indian Constitution has made it clear the Fundamental Duties of the citizen of the country. It says- It shall be the duty of every citizen of India 

(a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the national Flag and the National Anthem;

(b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;

(c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;

(d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;

(e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women;

(f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;

(g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures;

(h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;

(i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence;

(j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement;

(k) who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years. 

Stating that the way we keep ourselves aware of our Fundamental Rights, he stressed that we should also need to understand our Fundamental Duties. Both the Fundamental Rights and the Fundamental Duties are connected. There is a need for every citizen to take his duties towards the nation seriously. While it is absolutely necessary to defend the Fundamental Rights relating to life, liberty, equality and freedom of expression etc, there is a need that we, as citizens, which also include people’s representatives, take our duties towards the nation seriously. Entitlements come with duties as well. 

The Minister also  said that a proper environment for enjoying rights will be created if every citizen performs her duties. The people’s representatives should set an example for the common people in this regard. Our country has emerged not only as the largest democracy but also as a glowing symbol of a vibrant, pluralistic culture with the flourishing parliamentary system, with the Constitution acting as the guarantee of protecting the rights of every society.

Shri Naqvi added that the Rights and Fundamental Duties of citizens are equally important. Rights and Responsibilities are two sides of the same coin and both go together. If we have rights, we also have some responsibilities attached to those rights. Wherever we are living, whether it is at home, society, village, state or country, rights and responsibilities go with us together.

As a good citizen of the country, he exhorted that need to know and learn our rights and duties and make them an essential part of the life for the welfare of society and the country. If life can be changed through individual actions, then why the collective efforts made in the society cannot bring positive effects in the country and the whole society? Therefore, fulfill the Fundamental Duties is necessary for the prosperity and peace of the society and the entire country.

Shri Naqvi said that while choosing an apt form of government for the newly independent India, the Forefathers preferred to choose Parliamentary Democracy, thereby, making the Government of the day accountable to its electorate. The Mantra of this accountability is “Fundal Rights and Fundamental Duties. In this set up, Legislatures have become the instruments of voicing public opinions and concern, raised by the members inside the Chamber on behalf of their constituents and representing their interests in all their diversity. Besides, in order to pass effective laws, the Legislatures need time, energy, information and thought on the part of its members, i.e. the Legislators. It is in this context that focus and capacity building of Legislators on the legislative business become of paramount importance in the success of a parliamentary democracy. 

He further said that Legislative Orientation is one of the most important mechanisms through which the Legislators, particularly the first time elected get acquainted with parliamentary procedures and practices and with the working of the Institution including conventions, etiquettes and traditions. In this context, I would like to quote Late Shri Arun Jaitley when he said, “(Politics) influences the life of a nation and, therefore, the stature of the men who man this system, must always measure up to the responsibility that the country vests in them.” Orientation helps the Legislators to be aware of this responsibility vested in them by the people.        

Shri Naqvi also stated  that in this context, it is noteworthy to mention that in Lok Sabha, the Parliamentary Research and Training Institute for Democracies (PRIDE) has been successfully conducting Orientation Programmes for the newly elected members of the Parliament. During the Orientation Programmes, eminent parliamentarians, senior parliamentary officials and experts interact with the newly elected members on various aspects of the working of our parliamentary institutions. The discussion sessions are interactive in nature, members can freely exchange views with the Faculty who share their experiences and ideas. 

The Minister underlined that as we all know, the Legislators are primarily required to engage in lawmaking and therefore, they must be able to identify a policy issue, potential legislative options to address that issue, consult relevant stakeholders relating to the issue and select a preferred option after deliberating over available options. This assessment and deliberation can occur only when the Legislators are briefed adequately on the legislations proposed to be passed. In this direction, the Briefing Sessions on Legislative Business of the Legislature are of very high importance to enhance focus of legislators on legislative business. Here, I would like to share with the Hon’ble Presiding Officers about our experience on Briefing Sessions on important Legislative Business, which we have recently initiated in the Lok Sabha. Aimed at improving awareness of our members on the legislative issues before the House, these Sessions acquainted Members with impact analysis of the proposed legislative options. And I am happy to place on record that I have received positive feedback from the members on this initiative of ours.

Shri Naqvi said that apart from law-making, ensuring the accountability of Executive is also one of the core-functions of the Legislature. The Parliament of India does so by constituting Department Related Standing Committees, which examine implementation of various policies by the Government, among others. To perform these legislative functions, it is imperative that Legislators have access to sector-specific research support. Services of the Research Service of the Legislature must be explored to complement the information received from the Executive. Presence of informed legislators in Committees also ensures that good policy legislations get to the floor of legislature for passage, which leads to passage of socially and politically relevant laws suited for meeting the needs of this ever-evolving society.

Shri Naqvi informed  that in the USA, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) works exclusively for the United States Congress, providing policy and legal analysis to committees and Members of both the House and Senate, regardless of party affiliation.

Shri Naqvi said that Legislatures in India have played a significant role in the transformation of the nation by enacting various socially relevant legislations in its tryst with destiny for the last seven decades. However, various challenges, on account of political, social, economic and technological advancements, stand in the success of parliamentary democracy in India which can only be tackled if the legislators are focused and equipped with latest information on subjects of legislative importance. Ability to retain and use this information in legislative business will only lead towards effective functioning of our parliamentary institutions.

			YEAR END REVIEW, 2019, MNRE

			 
			
		
	


As a part of Nationally Determined Contributions as per the Paris Accord on Climate Change, India has made a pledge that by 2030, 40% of our installed power generation capacity shall be from non-fossil fuel sources and also by 2030, reduce emission intensity of GDP by 33-35 % from 2005 level. Economic growth, increasing prosperity, a growing rate of urbanisation and rising per capita energy consumption has increased the energy demand of the country.

Keeping in view the above and our commitment for a healthy planet with less carbon intensive economy, we decided in 2015 that 175 GW of renewable energy capacity will be installed by the year 2022. This includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from biomass and 5 GW from small hydro power.The substantial higher capacity target will ensure greater energy security, improved energy access and enhanced employment opportunities. With the accomplishment of these ambitious targets, India will become one of the largest Green Energy producers in the world, even surpassing several developed countries.

The Prime Minister in his address atto Climate Action Summit stated that “India’s renewable energy capacity would be increased to much beyond 175 GW, and later till 450 GW”.In line with the objective of expanding renewable energy sector, several important initiatives were taken during year 2019.

Renewable Energy capacity is rising rapidly and the status of projects as on 17.12.19 is given below:

                The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Department of Pension and Pensioners’ Welfare (DoPPW), has taken a landmark step to make life easier for senior citizens to submit their Annual Life Certificate for continued pension. The Department vide its circular no. 12/4/2020-P&PW(C)-6300, dated 17.01.2020 has issued directions to all the Pension Disbursing Banks to send SMSs/Emails to all their pensioners on 24th October, 1st November, 15th November and 25th November every year reminding them to submit their Annual Life Certificates by 30th November.

The Department for stricter monitoring in order to ensure that no pensioners are left out, directed all Pension Disbursing Banks to make an exception list as on 1st December every year of those pensioners who fail to submit their Life Certificate and issue another SMS/Email to them for submitting the Life Certificate. The bank in addition will also ask such pensioners through SMS/Email as to whether they are interested in submission of Life Certificate through a chargeable doorstep service, the charge not exceeding Rs.60/-.

The Central Pension Processing Cells (CPPC) of the Pension Disbursing Banks shall now be duty bound to submit a report to DoPPW in the month of January, February & March respectively, indicating the total number of pensioners who have not given their Life Certificate along with a breakup of the Certificates submitted physically and through Digital means.

The above is a landmark step from the side of the Central Government showing due care for pensioners. This step is in addition to the order issued recently dated 18.07.2019 vide which all pensioners age 80 years and above have been given an exclusive window to submit their Life Certificate w.e.f. 1st October every year instead of 1st November every year.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, DrJitendra Singh launched the DoPT’s online certificate course on “Relevance of Gandhi in the Contemporary World” at a function here today. The online course/programme on Mahatma Gandhi is an initiative of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) under the iGOTprogramme to pay tribute to Father of the Nation coinciding with the Martyr’s Day today.

Addressing the gathering, DrJitendra Singh said the Mahatma’s teachings are more relevant today than ever before. “Gandhijicreated a mass awareness for people’s participation and the freedom movement. Even today, the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), inspired by Bapu, has turned into a mass campaign because of translating Gandhian thought into action. As far as adopting Gandhiji’s thoughts in Government functioning is concerned, Bapu stressed upon the concept of incorruptibility,” he said. “It is not enough to weed out corruption, but it must be eliminated. Like the resort to non-violence is not an ideal of the meek and weak, but of the strong and powerful, similarly the principle of incorruptibility can be adapted to the administration,” he added.

The online module/course on “Relevance of Gandhi in the Contemporary World” under the iGOT platform will be a certificate programme.  This Department has collaborated with the Centre for Gandhi and Peace Studies, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) and Gandhi Smriti and DarshanSamiti (GS & DS), to develop this Certificate Programme.

The aim of the Government is to reach out to the last man in the last queue. This will help achieve maximum outreach, bring transparency in Governance and help interact directly with the citizens,” he added.

DrJitendra Singh is the first Union Minister to participate in a Facebook Live session ever.

 

 

Answering online queries during the one hour programme, DrJitendra Singh assured efforts are on to help citizens lodge their grievances on the Centralized Public Grievance Redress And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) portal in Indian languages and the process will be expedited. “Many States have already replicated the CPGRAMS model and already some States have provisions to lodge grievances in respective regional languages,” he said.

The Minister said a big leap has been taken in the newly carved out Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir with the launch of the “Awaaz-e-aam” UT Grievance Redressal Cell and it will soon be linked with the CPGRAMS portal, he added.

                There has been a steep reduction in the pendency of vigilance complaints in the last few years under the Modi Government. Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh was briefed about the status, including pendency and disposal, of Vigilance cases in the Central Vigilance Commission, for which DoPT (Department of Personnel & Training) is the administrative Ministry.  

Vigilance Commissioner Shri Sharad Kumar, who is presently officiating as Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC), met Dr Jitendra Singh here yesterday and gave him an update about the current status of pendency and disposal of vigilance cases in the Commission.

The Minister was informed that there has been a steep reduction in the pendency of vigilance cases from an average of 3,000 in the last three preceding years to 876 in 2019, of which 683 pertain to December, 2019. A large number of old pending cases of over 5 to 10 years' duration were reviewed and most of the cases were disposed of, thereby drastically reducing pendency from 1,500 cases of the last three years to about 950 at the end of December 2019. 

 

 

 

Shri Sharad Kumar also gave an update about the functioning of the Advisory Board on banking frauds, which was constituted in August 2019. The important purpose of the Board is to address fear psychosis of bank officials and to insulate honest decisions from investigation by probe agencies. 

 

The recent achievements in the working of the Vigilance Commission include launch of a robust and comprehensive online reporting mechanism for Chief Vigilance Officers of various Ministries/Departments/Organizations under the Commission. This new mechanism has enabled a more focused and timely review of vigilance and anti-corruption cases in various wings and departments of the Central government organizations. In addition, Preventive Vigilance booklet has been brought out with the objective to share the case studies on systematic initiatives/improvements undertaken.

Dr Jitendra Singh was also updated about the functioning of the e-office which was introduced with effect from 1st November 2019.

Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir would soon emerge as a model of transformation for the rest of the country. He said this while inaugurating the first Capacity Building Programme on General Financial Rules-2017, e-Procurement and Government e-Marketplace (GeM) at Convention Centre, Jammu. The capacity building program is being conducted by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Govt. of India in collaboration with Govt. of Jammu & Kashmir, National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG), National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM) and Institute of Management, Public Administration and Rural Development (IMPARD) for 385 officials of the Govt. of Jammu and Kashmir. Shri K K Sharma, Advisor to the Lt. Governor of Jammu and Kashmir and Shri BVR Subramaniyam, Chief Secretary Jammu and Kashmir were also present on the occasion. 

While inaugurating the session, Dr. Singh said that this was a third major conference being organized in the Union territory within a span of two months. The Minster said that since every Central law is now applicable to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, it was necessary to unlearn the things that were learnt in the past in order to adopt to the new system. The Minister reiterated that all the Central laws like the Right to Information Act, Land Registration Act, Prevention of Corruption Act and the like, had become applicable to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir right from 31st October, 2019. 

While referring to a series of workshops and conferences being organised in J&K and cities other than Delhi, Dr Singh said that a bamboo workshop-cum-exhibition and a Pension Adalat would also be organised within this month. 

Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of Monitoring Dashboard of Grievance Portal of Government of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Singh said that the increase in the number of complaints was not a negative development but instead showed an increase in people's faith on the administration and implied improvement in the response and redressal mechanism of the Government. 

Dr Singh also mentioned that a Central Administrative Tribunal bench would be established in J&K apart from a Law University and a state-of-the-art Sports Stadium that were under consideration at various levels. 

Earlier in his welcome address, Shri. V. Srinivas, Additional Secretary, DARPG, said that the Department had been engaging extensively with the Government of Jammu and Kashmir for organising the conference which was the third major conference of its kind in a span of two months in J&K. He said that the conference sought to take forward the commitment to apply all the central laws to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir through proper training and capacity building. The conference witnessed huge participation of officials from various departments of UT of J&K.  

Earlier during the conference, a five year vision document of Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances was released besides launching a monitoring Dashboard of the Grievance Portal of Govt. of Jammu and Kashmir. A Memorandum of Understanding and exchange of documents was also done between DARPG, NCGG and IMPARD for the capacity building of 1000 officials of the Govt. of Jammu and Kashmir.

                The Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dhamendra Pradhan has said that India will continue to lead the global sustainable energy agenda. Delivering the key note address at the TERI’s World Sustainable Development Summit 2020 on ‘Energy Future Road Map’ here today, the Minister said “We, in India, are in the midst of a major transformative shift in our energy sector, both in scale and complexity and also the interdependence across different systems. The trajectory to end energy poverty in India, as compared to the rest of the world, is based on our special national circumstances.  The right mix of enablers are being put in place to ensure that the energy transition is secure, affordable, reliable and sustainable.” He added “to end energy poverty in the country, we will remain cognizant of the need to root economic development firmly to achieve the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals and commitments made at COP 21.”  



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briefing about energy requirements, the Minister said “India is now the third largest energy consumer after the US and China. While our energy demand increased to 882 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2017, the per capita consumption of energy is still 30% of the global average. Our energy consumption is projected to grow at 4.2 percent per annum up to 2035. India’s share of the total global primary energy demand is set to roughly double to about 11 percent by 2040, driven by strong economic development. In India, we are finding ways to achieve the twin objectives of more energy availability and less carbon through a healthy mix of all commercially-viable energy sources.”  

Shri Pradhan added that despite our system-wide energy transition measures, crude oil would continue to play a critical role at this stage of development in meeting country’s energy requirements. He said the Government has set out a road map for reducing India's crude oil imports by 10% by 2022. “We are in the process of developing new strategies and initiatives to achieve this target. We are working towards transformation to a gas-based economy, tapping into indigenously produced biofuels, apart from adopting renewable energy and energy efficiency measures,  to achieve the much-needed carbon reductions.  As part of the energy transition, decarbonisation of the energy sector is picking up momentum in India” Shri Pradhan said. The Minister also stated that government is working to improve energy efficiency and productivity, demand substitution, improving refinery processes and promotion of bio and alternate fuels. 

Shri Dharmendra Pradhan also said “the biggest game-changer in our drive to bring about greater environmental sustainability and flexibility in the energy system is through the rapid deployment of natural gas in our energy mix”. He also added “we are advancing our collaboration with countries, such as Brazil and the US, to improve blending technologies in transport sector.  To reduce vehicular pollution, BS VI quality fuel, equivalent to Euro 6 standard, will be supplied in the entire country from 1 April this year. Given the abundance of biomass in the country, the use of Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) will be promoted in a big way in automotive, industrial and commercial uses in the coming years.”

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  The Minister further said that in the global drive to secure sustainable energy, India is defining new pathways keeping in view its unique energy needs.  “India will continue to play an active role in leading the global sustainable energy agenda. Our commitment to keep carbon footprint to low levels remains unwavered as we pursue to enhance energy footprint in the country” He added.

 



 

On the occasion, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan also released a report ‘Towards a low carbon steel sector’ – Overview of the changing market, technology and policy context for Indian steel.

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dhamendra Pradhan has called upon all the stakeholders to contribute positively in transforming India into a gas based economy.  Presiding over the national conclave on emerging opportunities in the natural gas sector here today, he said that the present share of gas in the energy basket of the country is 6.2% and the target is to take it to15% by 2030.  He said that the world average is 24% while within the country, the Gujarat has 26% share of gas based energy.  



 

Describing the natural gas as the next generation fossil fuel which is comparatively cheaper and less polluting, Shri Pradhan said that the Government has taken a number of initiatives to give thrust to gas based economy.  He said that the domestic gas production is likely to increase in the current financial year to 34.55 billion cubic metre.   Pricing and LNG marketing freedoms have been given to gas producers, LNG terminal capacity is being augmented and national gas grid is being developed.  Shri Pradhan said that this is the first time that Government of India is providing Rs.10,500 crore worth of viability gap funding for laying pipeline in Eastern and North-Eastern India.  He said gas pipeline network will be ready from Kutch to Kohima and Kashmir to Kochi.  Shri Pradhan said that 4 lakh crore rupee worth of investment is likely to be made in such projects which is a challenge as well as an opportunity.He said that the sources of import have been diversified and the Government is holding discussions with gas-exporting countries for getting more gas on favourable terms. He said that CBG is a great initiative which has the potential to generate wealth from waste, provide employment, protect the environment, and give boost to the economy.

Calling upon the States to fully cooperate and support the gas infrastructure activities and projects, he said Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has prepared a draft Policy of City Gas Distribution (CGD), which may be adopted by States to facilitate such activities. 



 

Shri Pradhan said that PNGRB is likely to soon start bid round 11 for CGD and States make like to give suggestions in identification of geographical areas.  He also called upon the States to adopt qualification packs developed by Hydrocarbon Sector Council in their Vocational Training Institutes.   He called upon the States to actively promote CNG usage in State transportation and mining sector.  

Shri Pradhan called upon all the entities who have bagged CGD rounds to not delay their work and immediately start action.  He also called upon PNGRB to strictly monitor the progress.  

Shri Pradhan announced that Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry (FIPI) will have a Help Desk for holding any future interaction with all stakeholders. He assured full support to all the stakeholders who are part of the gas based supply chain.

In today’s meeting State Ministers from Gujarat, Assam, Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Manipur, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Goa participated.  They also gave suggestions for improving the gas network in the country.  Besides various stakeholders from private and public sector involved in various aspects of supply chain of gas distribution took part in the conference.

An exhibition was also inaugurated by the Minister, highlighting various developments and initiatives in the gas sector.

Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production  

 

2.1    Natural gas production by ONGC during December, 2019 was 1998.37 MMSCM which is 11.58% lower than target and 9.04% lower when compared with December 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-December, 2019 was 17918.28 MMSCM which is 5.75% and 2.70% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. 

 

Ø  Non-realization of gas production planned from WO16 cluster from Dec’19 in absence of MOPU.

Ø  Less Gas production from Vasistha/S1 wells in EOA due to sand incursion issues. 

Ø  Less production due to less gas off take by OTPC, Tripura.

Ø  Disruption in field activities in Assam due to protests.

Ø  Less gas off take by gas consumers.

 

2.2         Natural gas production by OIL during December, 2019 was 225.98 MMSCM which is 17.38% lower than monthly target and 2.87% lower than December, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-December, 2019 was 2077.79 MMSCM which is 0.82% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year but 18% lower than the cumulative target. Major reason for shortfall in production is less gas withdrawal by major customers owing to shutdown of their plants.

 

2.3        Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during December, 2019 was 416.44 MMSCM which is 4.87% lower than monthly target and 4.67% higher than December, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-December, 2019 was 3854.29 MMSCM which is 5.70% and 7.64% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø  RJ-ON/6: Production is lower due to less offtake by consumers. Production also lowers due to zone pressure depletions in some wells, water ingress and tubing damage. (FEL)

Ø  Sohagpur West: Dewatering wells gas breakout awaited, slow gas ramp up in pilot wells and scaling in producing wells. (RIL)

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today interacted with a delegation from Russian media.  Speaking to the delegation, Shri Pradhan said, “2019 was a landmark year which boosted the bilateral relations between India and Russia to hitherto unscaled heights. The special and privileged strategic partnership between our two countries was strengthened significantly. Hon.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has described Russia as a reliable partner and a special friend and President Putin in turn has talked of taking India-Russia relations to new heights of cooperation. It is uncommon to find two major powers that have developed a partnership such as ours.”



On bilateral co-operation in steel sector, Shri Pradhan said, “We remember fondly the contribution of then Soviet Union in development of our steel industry. We recognise the immense potential of Russia in supplying coking or metallurgical coal, which is largely imported by India, to support the Indian steel industry. During my visit to Moscow and a follow up visit to Vladivostok, we were able to identify the strong potential for expanding cooperation between India and the Russian Far East for import of coking coal. Further, I had requested Russian authorities to invest in developing the inland and port logistic of the Far East, improve connectivity of these ports with mining locations and improvements in evacuation infrastructure. In a short span of less than six months, Indian steel makers significantly increased off-peak of coking coal from the Far East Russia. I see great prospects in this sector in the coming years.”

Speaking about co-operation in oil and gas sector, Minister Pradhan said, “With the guidance of our strong leaders, we have strengthened our engagement in hydrocarbon sector. There is an ‘Energy Bridge’ between our two countries. With Russia being one of the largest producers of oil and natural gas and India being the world’s third largest energy consumer, Russia has the potential to become an important source to fulfill India’s oil and gas requirements. The Joint Statement on cooperation in oil and gas during Hon’ble Prime Minister’s visit to Russia in September provides a roadmap to deepen cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector. We invite investments by Russian companies in Indian oil and gas sector, particularly in gas business, gas infrastructure and petrochemicals.”

On the gas based economy, he said, “India has also embarked on the path of becoming a gas based economy. India is investing over $60 billion in developing natural gas supply and distribution infrastructure. LNG imports from Russia at competitive rates will help us in meeting the objectives of price stability and energy security.”

Speaking about connectivity, Shri Pradhan said, “We are keen to explore the new sea route to source crude oil and LNG through Russia’s Arctic. The route has the potential to cut the cost and time for transporting LNG from Russia to India. A sea line between Far-East Russia and the East coast of India will also facilitate sourcing of coking coal from the region.”

On crude oil sourcing, Shri Pradhan said, “We are working on the strategy to diversify our crude oil supply sources and we are now exploring ways to import crude from Russia as well.”

                Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today flagged off 3121st Bulk LPG Tanker Truck and participated in the Special National Vendor Development Program on Petroleum & Steel sectors for SC/ST Entrepreneurs, organised by Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DICCI).



Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said the Government has gone beyond providing scholarships and reservations for SC/STs, and is empowering them to become entrepreneurs. “Inspired by the vision of Babasaheb, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has worked with the spirit of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Vikas to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of SC/ST community, disadvantaged sections of the society and minorities. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has envisioned that the SC/ST community should become the owners of businesses and be job creators instead of just being job seekers. Under his leadership, India is establishing a new model of affirmative action for the world.”, he said.



Speaking about Government’s various efforts towards welfare of SC/ST communities, Shri Pradhan said “Government has come up with Rs.100 lakh crore worth of National Infrastructure Pipeline. We made a plan to open 75,000 petrol pumps, out of which 20,000 have been reserved for the SC/ST brothers and sisters. Out of this, more than 17 thousand LOIs have already been given to them, and work has begun for putting up 3600 Retail Outlets. Out of over 8cr Ujjwala connections, over 3cr. connections have been handed over to the SC/ST families”. The Minister further said that various Ministries have ensured handholding of SC/ST entrepreneurs to make Stand Up India, a success. He said that government has simplified procedures, established policies, worked with all stakeholders to support the entrepreneurial spirit of SC/ST brothers and sisters and to ensure new entrepreneurs are not at a disadvantage.

                In-depth Review of India's Energy Policies report by International Energy Agency (IEA) was launched in New Delhi today by Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel, Shri Pralhad Joshi, Minister of Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Raj Kumar Singh, Minister of State (I/C) for Power and New and Renewable Energy, Shri Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, Niti Aayog,  Ambassadors, Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director, International Energy Agency, and Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, Niti Aayog.

 



 

Thanking Dr. Fatih Birol and his IEA team for coming up with a comprehensive Report covering India’s energy sector in its entirety, Shri Pradhan said that IEA’s findings are a vindication of the significant advances made in realizing the energy vision enunciated by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, anchored by Energy Access, Energy Efficiency, Energy Sustainability and Energy Security, with Energy Justice at its core.

 



Shri Pradhan said that India is now the third largest energy consumer in the world.  India is in the midst of a major transformative shift in its energy sector. The energy polices already put in place by the Government and also those on the anvil, clearly demonstrate our determination to embrace this energy transition in a sustainable and responsible manner.

 

The Minister said that a number of pathbreaking initiatives launched by Indian Government since 2015, have redefined India’s commitment to sustainable energy. “Our key challenge as a developing country, with per capita energy consumption below the global average, is to meet the growing demand for energy. India made great strides in recent years towards achieving universal access to modern energy, including clean cooking and electricity, affordable, secure and cleaner energy for its people. The Report captures well the progress made in achieving sustainable energy for all, as reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7).  It does also highlight the persisting challenges to be focused in the coming days.”, he added.

 

Talking about the Ujjwala Yojana, Sh Pradhan said that the remotest corners of India have been touched for cleaner fuel access under it. “We are also sharing our experience with our friends in Africa and Asia to enable them to benefit from the best practices in promotion of LPG. I do recognize that we have more ground to cover and also to ensure that the initiatives are implemented for achieving universal coverage in the country.”, the Minister said.

 

Shri Pradhan said that India’s transformation to a gas-based economy and developing indigenously produced biofuels, apart from renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, can potentially achieve the much-needed carbon reductions. As part of the energy transition, decarbonisation of the energy sector is picking up momentum in India. “Given India’s development imperative, our thrust is on building oil and gas infrastructure to ensure access to affordable energy to all our citizens. The report notes that India is moving towards a gas-based economy.”, he said.

Shri Pradhan said that an estimated investment of 100 billion dollar in oil and gas infrastructure has been lined up. The gas pipeline network will soon be covering the length and breadth of the country; from Kutch in Western India to Kohima in the East, and from Kashmir in the North to Kanyakumari in the South. “In yet another important decision, our Government has approved viability Gap Funding/ Capital Grant at 60 percent of the estimated cost of Rs 9265 crore for the North East gas grid project to develop gas pipeline grid of 1656 Km in the eight States of the North-eastern region.”, he said.

 

The Minister said that We are aggressively working to build City Gas Distribution Network covering more than 400 districts of India. This network will serve 72% of India’s population with cleaner and affordable gas over more than 50 % of India’s geography. Talking about the proposed Workshop on Natural Gas on 23 January in New Delhi, he said that it will bring together for the first time all relevant stakeholders under one roof. “I am confident that these initiatives in the gas sector would bring about a transformative change in India’s energy landscape.”, Shri Pradhan said.

 

The Minister said that the Report acknowledges Government’s efforts in making energy security as a prime policy priority, and recognizes the efficiency achieved due to Government’s relentless march in undertaking tectonic reforms in the energy sector and continued pursuit of market-based solutions. He said “We have taken note of IEA’s recommendation for reinforcement of India’s oil emergency response policy.  Enhancing international engagement on global oil security issues is already an active goal being pursued by my Ministry. Energy has become an essential commodity in our bilateral trade engagements with several key trading partners and in positioning India as an important strategic player in global energy landscape.”

 

Talking about the diversification of oil sources and development of alternate resources of energy as such bio-fuel, he said that these are being undertaken on an accelerated mode. “We are on the way to achieve 20% ethanol blending in petrol and 5% bio-diesel in diesel by 2030. Indeed, to promote energy sustainability, our new National Biofuel policy focuses on waste-to-wealth creation and targets to generate various types of bio-fuels from agriculture residue and municipal waste.”, Shri Pradhan said.

 

Expressing deep concerned about the crude oil price volatility, the Minister said that ttoday, we are meeting in the backdrop of rising tensions in the Middle East and its impact on stability and security in the region. 

 

He said “We have taken several measures to ensure investor friendly environment. IEA has noted that during the period 2015 to 2018, investments in the energy sector in India recorded the second highest growth in the world. We are happy that global oil and gas majors like Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, BP, Shell, Total, Roseneft and ExxonMobil are making their significant presence in India.”

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval as under:


	The North East Gas Grid project of Indradhanush Gas Grid Limited with viability Gap Funding/ Capital Grant at 60% of the estimated cost of Rs 9265 crore (Including interest during construction). Quantum of VGF would be capped at 60% of estimated project cost and would not be linked with upward capital cost variation. 


· MoPNG shall identify milestones for major activities for this project and link the same for releases of capital grant of the project.


	For effective monitoring of the project implementation, a Committee comprising of officials from Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Development of North East Region, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, and Department of Fertilizers, may be formed, which would periodically review the progress in implementation of the project and take steps to smoothen out any issues in execution.


Total length of pipeline is 1656 KM and tentative project cost is Rs 9265 crore.As per the plan, Gas Pipeline Grid would be developed in the eight states of the North-Eastern region i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura.

The Capital Grant will provide natural gas supplies to various types of consumers viz. Industrial, PNG(Domestic),  CNG  (Transport)   etc.   and   would   immensely help   in substituting the liquid fuels. The pipeline grid would ensure reliability and uninterrupted natural gas supplies to the consumers which otherwise gets severely affected due to various reasons in this part of the country.

Availability of Natural gas across the region is expected to boost industrial growth without impacting the environment and would offer better quality of life to the people in general due to use of cleaner and green fuel. 

Socio-Economic and Environmental Benefits


	Development of industrial climate in eight states of the north-eastern region i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura.


· Reduction in the usage of kerosene, wood etc. due to increased usage of environment friendly fuel natural gas thereby improving the environment in the region.

· Improvement in the standard of living of peoples living in the region.

· It will boost Exploration & Production activities and connect regional gas sources with pipeline network for early monetisation of natural resources in the region.


	Possibility of installing bottling plants for LPG can be explored for reducing transportation cost. Uninterrupted supply of LPG and other valueadded products can be ensured in the region which will bring energy security to the people in the area.


Background:

To usher in Gas based economy and to increase the share of natural gas in country's primary energy mix, Government is taking focused steps viz. enhancing domestic gas production, expeditious development of gas infrastructure including pipelines, City Gas Distribution (CGD) networks and Re-gasified Liquefied Natural Gas (R-LNG) Terminals as well as development of Gas market by providing open access to gas infrastructure.

Indradhanush Gas Grid Limited (IGGL), a joint venture company of five CPSEs (IOCL, ONGC, GAIL, OIL and NRL) has been incorporated on 10.08.2018 to develop and operate Natural gas pipeline grid in North-East region. Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has also issued provisional authorization to IGGL on 14.09.2018 for the development of North-East Gas pipeline grid.

                Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas today here signed contracts for 7 blocks, awarded under Open Acreage Licensing Programme (OALP) Bid Round - IV. The Government had launched OALP Bid Round – IV on 27th August 2019. The Bid Round-IV offered 7 blocks  under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) process. The bidding round closed on 31st October, 2019. Subsequent to evaluation, all 7 blocks were approved for award to ONGC, for which the Revenue Sharing Contracts have been signed today, in the presence of the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan. The total area awarded today in the 7 Onland blocks is 18,510 sq.km.. The blocks are spread across 3 sedimentary basins.

 



Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan highlighted the success of OALP Bid Rounds under the ambit of Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) introduced in the year 2016, primarily characterized by Revenue Sharing Mechanism replacing the earlier New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP) which had Production Sharing Mechanism. He said, “In the last two and a half years, Government has successfully bid out nearly 1.4 lakh sq. km for exploration and production. Seven  blocks awarded today under OALP IV to ONGC have resource potential of approx. 33 billion bbls of oil and oil equivalent gas.”



Speaking about reforms in the hydrocarbon sector, Shri Pradhan said, “We have shifted our focus from revenue to production maximisation and have adopted the path of continuous reform.” He said, “Technology infusion in E& P activities has seen tremendous progress in recent times. Our oil and gas companies are adopting digitisation, new technologies for augmenting production and growth.” Speaking about investments in energy sector, he added, “Energy sector will witness huge investments in coming years. Government has recently released the report of the task force on National Infrastructure Pipeline for 2019-25 which lays down a roadmap for 102 lakh crore rupees worth of investments. Energy sector will comprise about 24% of the projected capital expenditure in infrastructure. “

The four OALP Bid Rounds, conducted till date have been a success, with total of 94 blocks awarded covering an area of 1,36,790 Sq. Km to leading E&P companies. The operators of these blocks have since then initiated petroleum exploration activities or are in final stages of obtaining Petroleum Exploration Licenses (PELs). 

The Hydrocarbon Exploration & Licensing Policy (HELP), which has adopted the Revenue Sharing contract model, is a giant step towards improving the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in the Indian Exploration and Production (E&P) sector. It comes with attractive and liberal terms like reduced royalty rates, no oil cess, marketing and pricing freedom, round the year bidding, freedom to investors for carving out blocks of their interest, a single license to cover both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resources, exploration permission during the entire contract period, and an easy, transparent and swift bidding and awarding process. This was the maiden bidding round under the further liberalized policy terms, which focused on production maximization with higher weightage to work programme as part of evaluation criteria in Category I basin and no revenue share commitment as part of bidding parameters for category II and III basins.

With the successful roll out of the HELP/OALP regime, based on the world-class National Data Repository (NDR), the Government has achieved massive enhancement of exploration acreage in India. The exploration acreage which stood at approximately 80,000 sq. km. in 2019 from earlier regimes has now been enhanced to approx. 2,15,000 sq. km. after 4 rounds of OALP. The cumulative exploratory work commitment after the 4 rounds of OALP comprise 29,270 LKM of 2D Seismic Survey, 43,272 sq. km of 3D Seismic Survey, 369 Exploratory Wells and 290 Core Analysis to establish Shale Resources. This will generate an investment of approx. US$ 2.35 billion over next 3 to 4 years in exploratory work alone.

The 5th cycle of submitting Expressions of Interest (EoIs) closed on 30th November 2019 and currently the 6th cycle of EoI is open till March 31, 2020.

                The Letter of Engagement of NTPC as PMC for development about 300 MW Solar Power Projects by Togo was handed over here today by Mr. Kondi Mani, Charge d’ Affaire, Embassy of Togo, New Delhi, to Mr. Gurdeep Singh, CMD (NTPC), in the august presence of Shri R. K. Singh, Minister of Power & RE (GoI) & President of ISA Assembly. Mr. Upendra Tripathy, Director General (ISA) was also present. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri R K Singh expressed his happiness over the development and stated that RE project offers cheaper power. This resource must be harnessed by ISA member countries as RE makes it possible to supply electricity to people living in far-flung areas through distributed power supply model. He underlined the importance of independent regulators upon stating that under recently evolving model prepaid smart metering helps in smooth billing and collection and the governments need not invest in the projects which developers take care.

Togo is a Country in West Africa and Member of International Solar Alliance (ISA). The country has set an ambitious plan to achieve universal electricity access by 2030 with focus on capacity addition in Solar Power generation. The Country has taken various initiatives to achieve these targets. The Country has been requesting assistance of ISA for development of Solar capacity in the Country.

ISA has been taking various initiatives to assist the member countries to develop Solar Projects. Presently there are 6 Programmes of ISA to develop Solar capacities in Member Countries which include Agricultural Pumps, Mini grids, Rooftop Solar, Large Scale Grid connected Projects etc. The Programme on large scale Grid connected Projects on Solar park model was approved in 2nd Assembly held on 30th October 2019. Implementation of ISA Programmes are member driven and ISA Secretariat facilitates the implementation.

NTPC Limited is a Power Major and a Public Sector Company of Government of India, owning an installed Power capacity of more than 58,000 MW which include 870 MW of Solar Projects and 1062 MW under development. Apart from development of own Solar projects, the Company has been the nodal Agency for development of more than 4000 MW of Solar Projects on IPP Model.

Engagement of NTPC by Togo for PMC, based on endorsement of ISA: NTPC had submitted a proposal to ISA requesting endorsement of ISA to Member Countries to give Project Management Consultancy (PMC) to the member Countries for implementation of Solar Projects.

As per NTPC Proposal, in ISA member Countries where Solar Projects are implemented through competitive bidding, NTPC may act as a project Management Consultant (PMC). NTPC will carry out various activities for selection of Solar Project developers (SPDs) on competitive basis for setting up Projects on ownership basis and enter into Power Purchase Agreement with Government-designated entities. The scope of PMC includes presentations to the concerned ministries and other stakeholders in ISA Countries for structuring of Projects, assistance to bring out enabling policy and regulatory framework for competitive procurement of Solar Power, bid process management for selection of Project developers on competitive basis, structuring PPA, Roof/ Land leasing agreements etc. The PMC charges of NTPC will be recovered from the selected SPDs. NTPC based on the feasibility, may also develop Solar Projects by putting own equity in Countries where Feed in Tariff is in force. 

ISA Endorsement of NTPC: The proposal of NTPC, after review by ISA Advisory Committee, was put on Swiss challenge for 28 days on ISA website. Subsequently, the proposal was submitted to ISA Finance Committee. Based on theconcurrence of Finance Committee, the proposal has been cleared in 2nd ISA Assembly. 

Based on the above, a Letter of Endorsement was given to NTPC for extending PMC services and circulated to all the National Focal Points (NFPs) of ISA Member Countries. There will not be any direct cost implications to the member countries. However, the engagement of NTPC for PMC is the sole discretion of a Member Country. 

NFP (National Focal Point) of Togo, based on the endorsement of ISA has sent a communication to DG ISA for engaging NTPC for the PMC services for development of Solar PV Projects/Parks on 70 Hectares of identified land in Dapaong (Dalwak Region: Capacity More than 33 MW) and on 500 Hectares of identified land in Mango (Savanes Region: Capacity About 250 MW). Togo is the first ISA Country to avail the services of NTPC.

	Smart Metering:


 


	In the current financial year, Ministry of Power has issued guidelines to all States to convert all existing consumer meters into Smart meters in prepaid mode. Operation of Smart meters in prepaid mode would allow consumers to pay as per their own financial convenience and electricity consumption requirements.
	EESL, a JV between CPSUs in the power sector, has been providing Smart metering services to various Utilities as per MOUs entered into with them. EESL has also established innovative financing arrangements for the Smart metering projects that would enable them to provide smart metering services to the DISCOMs without requiring any outright CAPEX funding from the States/Utilities. The recoveries against the funding towards smart metering installations would be taken as a monthly annuity from the Utilities over a period of seven to eight years.
	Apart from installations in NDMC for about 50,000 consumers, EESL has also started installation of Smart meters in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. Out of these States, the maximum installation is in the State of Uttar Pradesh, where more than 7.78 Lakh smart meters have already been deployed across 11 cities.


 


	More than 9 lakh smart meters have been installed in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, NDMC-Delhi and Andhra Pradesh as detailed below:

	Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY):



	Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), a scheme for financial and operation turn around of Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) was launched by the Government for State owned Distribution Utilities on 20-11-2015 at a time when the outstanding debts and losses of the Distribution utilities had increased to levels that were adversely affecting the viability of the Power and Banking Sectors. The purpose of UDAY was to usher reforms across the Power and coal Sectors through competitive and cooperative federalism to pave the way for 24X7 affordable and reliable Power for all.



	UDAY incorporated a slew of measures, including financial re-engineering measures, as well as operational improvement measures. Exemptions were given to the States to borrow outside the FRBM limits in order to enable them to take over 75% of the outstanding debts of DISCOMs, as existing on 30th November 2015. The scheme had two outcome parameters: (i) AT&C loss reduction to 15%; and (ii) ACS-ARR gap reduction to zero by March 2019. Due to the large scale of problems/ challenges in some States, as well as late joining, some States were given extension to complete the turn around process by one or two years



	UDAY scheme is now in final stages, with majority of states having completed 3 years at the end of FY19. The performance from FY16 to FY18 (based on the data submitted by states on the UDAY portal) shows a consistent improvement in AT&C losses, and reduction in annual losses by almost 50% of pre-UDAY times.



	Significant improvements have been observed in terms of reduction in AT&C loss from 20.7% in FY16 to 18.2% in FY19. The lines losses have come down to below the levels of 20%, due to an increase in billing and collection of revenues, reduction in theft, and reduction in technical losses. States like Bihar, Haryana, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Manipur have increased the billing efficiency by ~ 8-10%. In many states, like Assam, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, and Meghalaya, collection efficiency has improved by more than 5%.



	Similarly, the gap between ACS and ARR has reduced from 59 paise per unit in FY16 to 27 paise per unit in FY19 due to cost side optimization measures including control in power purchase costs, and reduction in interest costs, and discipline in revision of tariff filings in most of the states.



	Half yearly trends of performance of UDAY States in FY20 indicate that the AT&C losses are lesser than those in the same period by 62 basis points, though there is a marginal deterioration in the revenue gaps. Variation in pattern of electricity consumption due to extent of heat and rainfall accounts for these variations.



	The Government of India is formulating additional reform frameworks to buttress the efforts under UDAY to achieve a complete financial and operational turn around of State owned Utilities.



	Hydro



	16% higher generation (120.7 BU) in 2019-20 (April ~ Nov.) from generation (103.9 BU) in 2018-19 (April ~ Nov.) 
	Mangdechhu hydropower project (720 MW) in Bhutan commissioned in August 2019 and inaugurated by  Prime Minister on 17.08.2019



	CCEA approval of Rs. 1600 crore in July 2019 for pre-investment activities of NHPC’s Dibang Multipurpose (2880 MW) project in Arunachal Pradesh, the largest hydropower project to be initiated in the country. 
	Revival of Subansiri Lower (2000 MW) project in Arunachal Pradesh, the largest under construction hydropower project, which was stalled since December 2011 due to local unrest and NGT case, has been re-started after NGT case was dismissed on 31.07.2019 and local issues were resolved
	Revival of Teesta-VI (500 MW) project in Sikkim, which was stalled since December 2012 through NHPC’s take over of the project through NCLT bidding.
	On the advice of the Central Govt., the state governments of hydro-rich states of Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh have provided relaxations to reduce tariff of hydropower projects: 



	Jammu & Kashmir has deferred free power, exempted water cess for 10 years and have given exemptions from local taxes to  Kiru and Kwar Projects. 
	Himachal Pradesh has also deferred free power, agreed for 50% reimbursement of State GST and for booking 1.5% LADF to any head other than project cost, BOOT/ BOOM for 70 years etc, with an objective to bring down hydro tariff below Rs. 4.5 per unit. On these lines, Govt. of Himachal Pradesh signed agreements with 3 CPSUs viz. NTPC, NHPC and SJVN for setting up 10 hydropower projects of 2917 MW on Chenab river entailing an investment of about Rs. 28,000 crore.



	Guidelines being prepared for operationalising the following measures to promote hydropower sector approved by the Union Cabinet on 07.03.2019 :
	Declaring Large Hydropower Projects (>25 MW) as Renewable Energy
	Hydropower Purchase Obligation(HPO)
	Tariff rationalisation measures
	Budgetary support for flood moderation component &
	Budgetary support for enabling infrastructure like bridges, roads etc. 


 

The saleability issues facing hydropower would be addressed through HPO, tariff rationalisation measures and budgetary support for flood moderation and enabling infrastructure like roads, bridges etc. Large Hydropower projects (>25 MW) would also become eligible for green funding after being categorised as renewable energy source.


	One Nation-One Grid-One Frequency:



	Expansion of ISTS transmission lines (220 kV and above) by 14,546 km
	Transformation capacity addition of ISTS network by 74,910 MVA

	Ensuring Sustainability of Power Sector- Addressing issue of Payment delays by Discoms: 



	The Central Government has taken a major step to address the problem of mounting outstanding dues towards Generating Companies by the Distribution Companies by issuing an Order on 28th June, 2019 regarding Opening and maintaining of adequate Letter of Credit (LC) as Payment Security Mechanism under Power Purchase Agreements by Distribution Licensees. This mechanism has been made effective w.e.f 1st August, 2019. 



	Under this mechanism the Power will be scheduled for dispatch only after Letter of Credit (LC) for the desired quantum of power with respect to the generating stations has been opened. It shall be ensured by the concerned Load Despatch Centre that such entity, during the period of non-scheduling of power on account of Non opening of LC or advance payment, has no access to procure power from the Power Exchange(s) and they shall not be granted Short Term Open Access (STOA). 



	The measure is expected to improve payments to the power generators and improve sustainability in the Power Sector. 



	Measures towards reduction of cost of power to the consumer:



	In order to reduce the cost of power procured by the Distribution Licensees, a new system has been put in place where for Inter State Generating Stations (ISGS), the merit order dispatch at national level shall be followed. Hence the cheapest generation will be available at the maximum level. This is a step where for ISGS, the State level merit order has been shifted to National level merit order. This mechanism has resulted in savings of approximately Rs 3 Crores every day and has a potential of saving Rs 1200 Crores in a year towards power procurement cost of Distribution licensees.
	An Order was issued by Ministry of Power on 15.11.2019 on “Reduction in cost of power due to pre-payment in entire value chain of power sector”. Electricity Regulatory Commissions are requested to take necessary actions in reduction of cost due to pre payment as in such cases the working capital requirements get reduced. This initiative reduces the cost of power to the consumer.



	Promotion of Renewable Energy:



	In Order to promote the capacity addition of Solar and Wind Power Projects, the waiver available for use of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS transmission charges and losses) has been extended for use of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) for transmission of electricity by Solar or Wind power projects commissioned till December 2022. The waiver shall be applicable for the twenty five years from the commissioning of such projects.
	Clarification on Orders related to Renewable Purchase Obligation for Captive Power Plants (CPP) has been issued on 1st February 2019.



	Allowing use of linkage coal for short term power procurement and power exchanges:



	For the first time, linkage coal was allowed to Power Plants for selling power in the Day Ahead Market (DAM) through power exchanges or in short term through a transparent bidding process through Discovery of Efficient Energy Price (DEEP) portal. A methodology in this regard was issued by Ministry of Power on 2nd December 2019.
	Till now the Coal Linkage was granted to power generating stations only for selling power through long term and medium term power purchase agreements. This move shall de-stress the Power Generating Stations which have not secured long term or medium term power purchase agreements.



	Revival of Stressed Assets : Pilot Scheme II:



	In our endeavour for revival of the stressed assets, a Pilot Scheme was introduced by MOP in April 2018 to facilitate procurement of aggregated power of 2500 MW for 3 (three) years (covered under medium term) from the generating companies having coal based Power Plants which are already commissioned without having a power purchase agreement for the quantum of power the Bidder is willing to bid. Based on the experience gained in the Pilot Scheme, Pilot Scheme –II for procurement of another 2500 MW for the period of three years under medium term was notified on 01.02.2019.

                Shri Raj Kumar Singh,  Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Power and New & Renewable Energy and Honourable Minister of State for Skill Development & Entrepreneurshiptoday released here today the ‘State Energy Efficiency Index 2019’, which tracks the progress of Energy Efficiency (EE) initiatives in 36 states and union territories based on 97 significant indicators. The index was released on  the occasion of RPM ( Review, Planning and Monitoring) meeting, which is being held on 09-10 Jan 2020 at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra, New Delhi. 

The index is developed by Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in association with Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE). It will help states contribute towards national goals on energy security and climate action byhelping drive EE policies and program implementation at the state and local level, tracking progress in managing the states’ and India’s energy footprint and institutionalising the data capture and monitoring of EE activities by states. 

The first such Index, the “State Energy Efficiency Preparedness Index 2018”, was launched on August 1, 2018. Taking forward the State Energy Efficiency Preparedness Index 2018, the State Energy Efficiency Index 2019 incorporates qualitative, quantitative and outcome-based indicators to assess energy efficiency initiatives, programs and outcomes in five distinct sectors – buildings, industry, municipalities, transport, agriculture, and DISCOMs. New indicators for this year include adoption of Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) 2017, energy efficiency in MSME clusters, etc.  

The required data was collected from the concerned state departments such as DISCOMs, Urban Development departments and other departments with the help of State Designated Agencies (SDAs).  This year, a total of 36 states and union territories have been assessed based on their efforts and achievements in policy and regulation, financing mechanisms, institutional capacity, adoption of energy efficiency measures and energy savings achieved.

For rational comparison, States/UTs are grouped into four groups based on aggregated Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) required to meet the state’s actual energy demand (electricity, coal, oil, gas, etc.) across sectors. TPES grouping shall help states compare performance and share best practices within their peer group. Under four categories based on TPES, Haryana, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashta, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Puducherry and Chandigarh have been evaluated as progressive states/UTs in the State Energy Efficiency Index 2019.

 

Key Takeaways for States

State EE Index 2019 shows that majority of the initiatives taken by states are related to Policies and Regulations. Most of the first-generation energy efficiency policies prepared by BEE under programmes on Standards & Labelling (S&L), ECBC, Perform Achieve & Trade (PAT), etc. are understood by states and as the next steps they should focus on ensuring greater compliance to achieve savings. Based on the analysis of responses submitted by states this year, a three-point agenda is suggested for consideration by state agencies:


	Proactive role by states in policy formulation and implementation to shift the focus from “policies in place” to “policies successfully implemented”.
	Strengthening the mechanism for data capture, management and public availability of data: For this year’s Index, SDAs proactively contacted various state departments to gather data. However, SDAs should further enhance their engagement with state departments and private sector to enable a robust mechanism for Energy Data Management System.
	Enhancing the credibility of EE schemes: Ensuring the integrity of programs that have direct or indirect linkages with common consumers is significant to energy efficiency market transformation.States must demonstrate an approach which includes enforcement and compliance checks as well as independent monitoring and verification of savings, which is integral to all EE policies andprograms.

                The Central Government in consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has notified new energy performance standards for Room Air Conditioner (RACs) on 30th October 2019. 

The 240C default setting has been made mandatory from Jan 1, 2020 for all room air conditioners covered under the ambit of BEE star-labelling program vide this notification. Additionally, the Indian Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (ISEER) as per the new standards will range from (3.30 - 5.00) for split and (2.70 – 3.50) for window air conditioners, which will be applicable from 1st January 2021 onwards.

The notification states, “All brands and types of star labelled room air conditioners, namely, Multi-Stage Capacity Air Conditioners, Unitary Air Conditioners and Split Air Conditioners which are rated from one star to five star, based on their relative energy efficiencies up to a rated cooling capacity of 10,465 Watts (9,000 kcal/hour) and manufactured, commercially purchased or sold in India, shall ensure default setting of temperature in the room air conditioners at twenty-four degrees Celsius with effect from the 1st January 2020.” 

BEE launched the voluntary star labelling program for fixed-speed room air conditioners (RACs) in 2006, and this program became mandatory on 12th January 2009. Thereafter, in 2015, voluntary star labelling program for inverter room air conditioners was launched and which was made mandatory with effect from 1st January 2018.  The BEE star labelling program for Room Air Conditioners now covers both fixed and inverter RAC up to a cooling capacity of 10,465 watts (2.97 TR). Continual enhancement in performance levels has resulted in substantial energy efficiency improvement of about 43% in the minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for split units, which are the most popular RACs sold in the market. ISEER (Indian Seasonal Energy efficiency ratio) is the energy performance index used for Room Air Conditioners (RACs) and its assessment is based on the bin hours defined in ISO 16358.

                Launched by Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on January 5th, 2015, the Government of India’s zero subsidy Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) and LED Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP), marked its fifth anniversary today.

SLNP is the world’s largest streetlight replacement programme and UJALA is the world’s largest domestic lighting project. Both have been spearheaded and implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture of PSUs under the Ministry of Power, Government of India.

Under the SLNP programme, over 1.03 crore smart LED streetlights have been installed till date, enabling an estimated energy savings of 6.97 billion kWh per year with an avoided peak demand of 1,161 MW and an estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction of 4.80 million tCO2 annually. LED streetlights have been installed in various states across the country, helping generate approximately 13,000 jobs to support GoI's Make in India initiative.

Through the UJALA initiative, over 36.13 crore LED bulbs have been distributed across India. This has resulted in estimated energy savings of 46.92 billion kWh per year, avoided peak demand of 9,394 MW, and an estimated GHG emission reduction of 38 million t CO2 annually.

With the concerted efforts towards building a robust ecosystem for LED in India, these programmes have bagged global awards like the prestigious South Asia Procurement Innovation Award (SAPIA) 2017 and for the innovative use of IT and the business results achieved in Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP), it won 2019 CIO 100 award. The highly successful UJALA and SLNP have also bagged the Global Solid State Lighting (SSL) award of excellence for the transformational contribution to the LED sector.

UJALA project brought the market transformation in energy efficiency sector. Prices of LED bulbs being distributed under UJALA programme have fallen to one-tenth of their rates in 2015 from INR. 310 to INR 38 in 2018. The switch from inefficient incandescent bulbs to LEDs is helping families reduce their electricity bills while also enabling them to access better brightness in homes. The money saved adds to a household’s disposable income and lifetime savings, thus improving their quality of life, generating prosperity in local communities, and in expanding energy access to all. With the average household electricity bills down by 15 per cent, the annual energy saving is equivalent to a week’s average earning. The sale of LED bulbs in the Indian market increased from 0.1 per cent of the lighting market in 2014 to 15 per cent within a year, with a projected increase to 60 per cent by 2020. The domestic LED market has also grown significantly beyond the UJALA programme, with the industry selling over 1.15 billion LEDs, far exceeding the UJALA programme’s target of 700 million LED unit sales.

Apart from this, the Government of India initiated the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (GSA) in 2018, which was aimed at promotion of social harmony by apprising rural communities of various government welfare schemes and initiatives. As a part of GSA, 21,058 Indian villages with a significantly large number of poor households were able to buy LED bulbs for a special price under UJALA programme. The LED bulbs equipped homes with energy-efficient, cost-effective lighting, and higher lumen output than conventional incandescent bulbs.

Simultaneously, LED Street Lighting National Programme has enabled citizens to increase productivity at night and made roads safer for pedestrians and motorists due to enhanced brightness and reduced dark spots. The power utilities of states where the installation of LEDs has been implemented save up to 50 per cent in electricity bills, while ensuring 95 percent of streetlight uptime. As these lights are automated, they switch on and off at sunrise and sunset thereby reducing wastage. Utilities can also remotely track and rectify any faults with support of CCMS. In the last five years, the LED streetlights installed have illuminated 3,00,000 km of roads in India, enabling public safety and energy efficient lighting.

Functioning of Gram Panchayats (GP) has a direct impact on the everyday life of millions of rural people. Hence, the role of GP is critical for overall inclusive development and for deepening democracy through participatory governance. The estimated number of streetlights in GPs of India is 3.08 crores, by retrofitting these 3.08 crores conventional streetlights to LED streetlights can enable energy savings of approx. 3420 Million kWh & CO2 emission reduction of approx. 29 lakh tons. Till date, under Street Lighting National Programme, approx. 23 lakhs LED streetlights have already been retrofitted in the Gram Panchayats in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Goa and Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

By March 2020, SLNP aims to replace 1.34 crore conventional streetlights in India with smart LEDs. This ambitious goal will make a tremendous difference, enabling peak demand reduction of about 1500 MW, annual energy savings of 9 billion kWh, and reduction in 6.2 Million tons of CO2 per year.  EESL has an ambitious plan in this portfolio for next 4-5 years where it intends to bring investment to the tune of INR 8,000 crores by 2024 by covering entire rural India. It is expected that more than 30 million LED streetlights would be retrofitted/installed by EESL.

Indian Railways is amongst the largest Railway systems in the world, addressing a significant part of the country’s transportation needs, both in the passenger and freight segment. It carries about 23 million passengers per day and over 3 million tons of freight every day over 65000 route kilometers. It has major growth plans and needs to improve service levels and operating efficiency. As a part of this endeavour, the RFID project has been taken up which aims to automatically and accurately track and trace rolling stock as they move across the country with a special focus on improving their safety and reliability. Two works for RFID project have been sanctioned by Railway Board for a total of Rs. 112.96 Crores. 

 

For implementing this project over Indian Railways, the Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS, the IT arm of the Indian Railways), GS1 India and the Indian Industry have come together in alignment with the Hon'ble Prime Minister's 'Make in India' initiative. Thereby creating a new segment in the AIDC (Automatic Identification and Data Collection) industry in India uniquely suited for the Indian Railways requirements. This project is being spearheaded by the Rolling Stock Department of the Indian Railways. GS1 India is deeply involved in ensuring the quality of the work and proper adoption of international standards. CRIS has been utilising the considerable expertise of GS1 in developing and validating solutions, based on GS1 Standards, for the Indian Railways. 

 

The project enables real time visibility of railway wagons through the National Rail Network using cutting edge technologies like RFID with GS1 global standards for unique & universal identification, in line with global best practices. It enables enhanced operational efficiency of the Indian Railways. This unique initiative of standards based technology development coupled with high-paced field work done by CRIS during last 15 months has now borne fruit – the complete technology eco-system for RFID implementation on the Indian Railways has been established jointly.

 

In order that RFID tags can be used in all locations in the country including those with poor connectivity, Indian Railways opted to use the GIAI-202 standard. Indian Railways has successfully field tested these CRIS designed GIAI202 encoded tags at a speed of 182.7 kmph. This feat puts the Indian Railways in the league of leaders with respect to AIDC technology in the Railways sector. 

 



 

Implementation plans: The Indian Railways has aggressive implementation plans for RFID. All Rolling Stock, roughly 3,50,000 vehicles, are expected to be tagged by 2021. Till now approximately 22,000 wagons and 1200 coaches have been fitted with RFID tags. Additionally, roughly 3500 fixed RFID readers are expected to come up which shall communicate to a central control center using GS1's LLRP (low level reader protocol) standard.

 

The complete solution also includes the integration of RFID readers with various equipment such as Train Presence Detectors (TPDs), trackside condition monitoring equipment etc. The combination of all of these allows for an early identification of rolling stock that may need maintenance. This will enable a paradigm shift on the Indian Railways in its move to improve reliability of its Rolling Stock, by moving from a predominantly time based maintenance methodology to a condition based maintenance. The operational advantages in terms of improved availability and reliability of Rolling Stock will affect each and every customer of the Indian Railways.

 



 

AIDC is being expanded on the Indian Railways to more areas such as Direct Part Marking and material management based on GS1 standards such as GTIN, CPID, SSCC, GLN etc. Automating information capture about assemblies and components is a key element in the Indian Railways implementation of Industry 4.0. Greater accuracy in data capture accompanied by greater efficiency is the key driver. GS1 India’s initiatives such as DataKart etc. are all expected to play an important role in the creation of master data from the suppliers to the Indian Railways. 

 

Looking ahead: Future areas that are currently under study include laundry management, medical working and others.

                Adding vision to the modernization plans of Ministry of Railways, station upgradation works are in progress in several railway stations across the country. Two such railway stations where stations are being renovated and upgraded with the latest passenger amenities are Salem Junction in Tamil Nadu and Dimapur station in Nagaland. 

As a part of station upgradation, Salem Junction is getting a new facelift in a phased manner. Approximately Rs 5 crores has been spent for improvement of station façade. This new façade has given a contemporary look to the station building. The landscaping area has been increased and the height of the compound walls has been reduced to prevent pasting of posters on them. Smooth traffic flow has been ensured in part of the first phase. Separate lanes are provided for buses, commercial vehicle such as taxis and auto, and for private vehicles. New area has been provided for App based car services near the existing vehicle parking stand. 

Custom made façade lighting arrangements have been made to illuminate the station building as per the occasion. During the days of national importance such as Independence Day and Republic Day, the building is lit up in tricolours of the National flag.

As a new initiative, green patches and vertical garden has been provided in the circulating area to give a pleasant look. Staircases have been provided with beautiful sceneries. In addition to this, LED backlit Passenger Amenity board and to assist visually challenged persons, Braille boards have been fixed at all amenities over the station. BMI kiosks, massage chairs and pulse kiosks have been installed in the station.

At present all important train services towards Erode are dealt from Platform No.1, for both directions from Platform No. 3 & 4, and some train services are dealt at Platform No. 5. For the benefit of passengers, following improvements on Platform No. 5 have been taken up -


	Modified platform shelter of new design planned to provide cover over complete platform.
	Toilets block at both ends of the platform
	Additional catering stall
	Lift and escalator connecting other platforms


While all the platforms will be modified under the project, the second entry to the railway station is also being improved. A monumental flag will be installed in front of the station building by 15th February 2020. Airport style lighting will also be done. The upgradation work is likely to be completed by June 2020.

Another railway station where upgradation work has been carried out is the Dimapur station under Lumding Division of Northeast Frontier Railway. It is the only railway station in Nagaland state falling in the Lumding – Dibrugarh section. Being the second largest station of Lumding Division in terms of passenger earnings after Guwahati, passenger friendly facilities and services in the station are of great importance. Various soft development works were taken up recently at a cost of about Rs. 2.00 crores to uplift facilities of the station. The face and feel of the station was uplifted to provide better passenger experience.

                Indian Railways has commissioned country’s first governmental Waste to Energy Plant, having capacity of 500 Kg waste per day, in Mancheswar Carriage Repair Workshop at Bhubaneswar in East Coast Railway. Member Rolling Stock, Shri Rajesh Agarwal inaugurated this plant on 22nd January 2020 along with GM, East Coast Railway. This Waste to Energy Plant has been constructed in three months. 

This Waste to Energy Plant, a patented technology called POLYCRACK, is first-of-its-kind in Indian Railways and fourth in India. It is world’s first patented heterogeneous catalytic process which converts multiple feed stocks into hydrocarbon liquid fuels, gas, carbon and water. Polycrack Plant can be fed with all types of Plastic, Petroleum sludge, Un-segregated MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) with moisture up to 50%, E–Waste, Automobile fluff, Organic waste including bamboo, garden waste etc., and Jatropha fruit and palm bunch. Waste generated from Mancheswar Carriage Repair Workshop, Coaching Depot and Bhubaneswar Railway Station will be feeder material for this plant.

The process is a closed loop system and does not emit any hazardous pollutants into the atmosphere. The combustible, non-condensed gases are re-used for providing energy to the entire system and thus, the only emission comes from the combustion of gaseous fuels. The emissions from the combustion are found to be much less than prescribed environmental norms. This process will produce energy in the form of Light Diesel Oil which is used to light furnaces.



FEATURES OF POLYCRACK TECHNOLOGY -

Polycrack has the following advantages over the conventional approach of treating solid waste:-


	Pre-segregation of waste is not required to reform the waste. Waste as collected can be directly fed into Polycrack.
	It has high tolerance to moisture hence drying of waste is not required. 
	Waste is processed and reformed within 24 hours. 
	It is an enclosed unit hence the working environment is dust free. 
	Excellent air quality surrounding the plant. 
	Biological decomposition is not allowed as the Waste is treated as it is received. 
	The foot print of the plant is small hence the area required for installing the plant is less when compared with conventional method of processing. 
	All constituents are converted into valuable energy thereby making it Zero Discharge Process. 
	Gas generated in the process is re-used to provide energy to the system thereby making it self-reliant and also bring down the operating cost. 
	There is no atmospheric emission during the process unlike other conventional methods except for combustion gases which have pollutants less than the prescribed norms the world over. 
	Operates around 450 degrees, making it a low temperature process when compared with other options. 
	Safe and efficient system with built-in safety features enables even an unskilled user to operate the machine with ease. 
	Low capital cost and low operating cost. 
	Fully automated system requires minimum man power.


 

AWARDS AND RECOGNITION -

This process has been awarded with the Best innovation Gold Medal in 2007 by Lockheed Martin, Dept of Science & Technology, Govt. of India, FICCI; Best Innovation Gold Medal 2007; Best Innovation Gold Medal 2008; Best Innovation Gold Medal 2009; Nominated for Tech-Museum Awards 2008; Frost & Sullivan – Global Innovation and Leadership Award -2011 and IGCW-2011 – Best Green Chemistry Innovation Award.

                (IR) is moving towards the adoption of automation and instrumentation in its maintenance practices for detecting defects/deficiencies in rolling assets. The objective is to achieve machine assisted automatic identification of defects in the Rolling Stock, well before any catastrophic failure. This will lead to a paradigm shift in maintenance practices of Rolling Stock of Indian Railways from “Time Based Maintenance” to “Condition Based Predictive Maintenance” with a view to enhance reliability and availability along with improved safety of Rolling Stock during run. 

For this, to begin with, On-line Monitoring of Rolling stock System (OMRS) is being adopted in Indian Railways. OMRS is a way-side inspection system consisting of Acoustic Bearing Detector (ABD) or Rail Bearing Acoustic Monitor (RailBAM) and Wheel Impact Load Detector (WILD)/Wheel Condition Monitor (WCM) to detect the faults in the bearings and wheels of rolling asset. This is an automated system for detecting defective wheels and bearings, and catching the same before it fails, thus resulting in efficient utilization of the coaches, wagons & locomotives. OMRS monitors the health of each Rolling Stock of the train in order to identify defective bearings & wheels. Defect report generation and alert communications takes place in real time for taking corrective action, accordingly.

The current practice of inspection of Rolling stock over Indian Railways is largely based on manual inspection, which is either track side Rolling-in-Examination or pit examination of Rolling Stock in stationary or slow moving condition. The visual inspections are done by trained manpower either in a pit or track side location but this relies on the individual judgment.  Therefore, an automated defect detection system viz. OMRS is being adopted by Indian Railways which consists of following sub-systems: 


	Acoustic Bearing Detector (ABD)/ Bearing Acoustic Monitor (RailBAM) gives an early warning on possible defects in the bearing box, before reaching the stage of hot box.
	Wheel Impact Load Detector (WILD)/Wheel Condition Monitor (WCM) system measures the wheel impacts on tracks to identify the flat surface on wheels in Rolling Stock. This system is based on Accelerometer device to measure the wheel impacts.
	PhotoTAG system is used for vehicle identification using Visual (photographic) identification technique.


 



 

Status of implementation of OMRS:


	Installation of 25 OMRS systems at 20 locations is in progress over entire Indian Railways’ network in phase-I on the sections identified by a high-level multi-disciplinary committee of Railway Board. 
	1st OMRS system has been installed at Panipat in Ambala-Delhi section of Northern Railway in November 2017 and a Central Control Room termed as “National Command Centre (NCC)” for monitoring of all OMRS sites has been set-up at Delhi Kishanganj in March 2018.
	After successful performance of 1st OMRS system at Panipat in March 2018, progressive installation of the remaining systems is being done.
	As on date, 6 OMRS systems have been installed and 10 systems are expected to be installed in current financial year 2019-20. The project of installation of remaining OMRS systems over Indian Railways is likely to be completed in the current calendar year 2020. 


 

Panipat OMRS site



Benefits from OMRS:

Summary of defects detected by OMRS in rolling stock upto June 2019 –


	Number of faults identified in Bearings by RailBAM : Wagons- 33, Coaches – 6, Locomotives -1
	Number of faults identified in Wheels by WCM : Coaches – 7 


Encouraged by the results of deployment of OMRS, including some critical detection which could have potentially been cause of an accident, not otherwise detectable by normal maintenance procedure, Indian Railways is now going ahead with greater adoption of track side based maintenance systems with an aim towards predictive maintenance. 

Further, moving towards predictive maintenance practices in yards, Indian Railways is envisaging to convert its “freight examination yards” into technology driven “Smart Yards” for automatic detection of faults/defects/deficiencies in freight wagons. These Smart Yards will predict anomalies like Hot Wheel Hot Axle, defective bearings, defective wheels, hanging/loose/missing parts etc. long before any failure actually happens. Smart Yards will be equipped with various automated technology driven systems including OMRS, Hot Box Detector, Wheel Profile Recorder and Machine Vision Equipments etc. 

The concept of smart yard is to use modern repair facilities, infrastructure, tools, automatic defect detection equipments and digital technology to enhance safety, reliability and productivity in freight trains operation.

The automatic defect detection equipments of Smart Yard shall provide advance data about hot axles and wheels, wheel flats, wheel profile & diameter, load imbalance, spring breakage, loose and hanging parts, wear condition of brake blocks etc. even before the rake arrives at the maintenance yard. It will then use this information for objective fault assessment and proactive staffing, thereby, reducing turn-around time while boosting safety and improving productivity. 

Status of implementation of Smart Yard:


	Initially in 1st phase, 40 identified yards will be converted into Smart Yards.
	COFMOW (a unit of Indian Railways) has been nominated for carrying out the overall work of Smart Yards.


 

The implementation of afore mentioned technology driven automatic predictive maintenance practices for up-keep of Rolling Stock not only will benefit Indian Railways on account of efficient/safe operation of trains but will also benefit on economic ground.

                The 14th Foundation Day of Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCIL) was celebrated at a function in New Delhi on 18th January 2020. Speaking on the occasion, Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry Shri PiyushGoyal congratulated team DFCCIL for completing 500 km of Dedicated Freight Corridor and exhorted the team to achieve the goal of 991 km by March 2020. He said that DFC has the impact to transform the railways sector. It is necessary to have separate tracks for freight and for passengers to ensure faster movement of both. Shri PiyushGoyal said that Indian Railways should run freight trains in convoys for maximum utilisation of the path and increasing the average speed of freight trains. Just like IRCTC which pays compensation for delays in its Tejas trains, Railways freight customers should be compensated for late arrival of goods trains and emphasized for time-tabled goods train run on DFCCIL. 

Shri Vinod Kumar Yadav Chairman, Railway Board and Chairman DFCCIL, enunciated that consolidation, growth and reforms are the three crucial areas which Indian Railways are working on. He said that Dedicated Freight Corridors are ushering in a paradigm change in Indian Railways and asserted that DFCCIL will play a significant role in shaping the Indian economy. He said that IR is upgrading the Railway network, especially the Delhi – Mumbai and Delhi – Howrah sectors for running faster and modern trains. He further emphasized that by having acquired 98.5 % land, DFCCIL is on the fast track for project completion.

Shri AnuragSachan, MD, DFCCIL, while addressing the gathering on this occasion profusely recognised the dynamic leadership and continuous support of Shri PiyushGoyal. He also assured that team DFCCIL will work hard to complete the project on time. 

Other dignitaries present in the function were Smt.

                A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between South Central Zone of Indian Railways and State Bank of India for Doorstep Banking for direct pickup of earnings covering all 585 Railway stations over SCR Zone. The direct pick up of cash from all the railway stations on SCR as per the MoU dispenses with the tedious and complex activity of movement of cash earnings through “Cash Safes” by trains. This will enable hassle free collection of traffic earnings by SBI and remittance into Government account avoiding delay in transmission of traffic cash earnings.

The MoU was signed by Dr B.S.Christopher, Chief Commercial Manager, Freight Services and Shri J.Meghanath, Financial Advisor and Chief Accounts Officer, Traffic on behalf of South Central Railway and Shri Surendra Nayak, Deputy General Manager, Digital and Transaction Banking Unit, SBI, Hyderabad Circle. 

Major benefits from the MoU are as follows:


	All the railway stations will have uniform cash remittance mechanism.
	Real time information about the cash being deposited by different stations which will help in better supervision and accountability.
	Avoidance of unwanted accumulation of cash at railway stations. 
	Smart way of remittance of station earnings.


 

Speaking on the occasion, General Manager, South Central Railway, Shri Gajanan Mallya expressed happiness with the tie-up and opined that such understandings will go a long way in streamlining financial transactions accounting. 

Prior to the MoU, the earnings generated at smaller railway stations each day were being manually sent with the Guard of nominated trains while in case of major stations, earnings were being remitted by the concerned commercial supervisor at the nominated nearest banks, which necessitated that Security escorts from Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel accompany the official. The existing procedure held scope for delay in remittances of cash owing to various factors such as holidays, availability of man power etc. The newly introduced facility of door step banking as per the MoU will do away with the difficulties faced earlier, besides increasing the pace of financial transactions and digitization of remittance of cash earnings of the Railways.

                Indian Railways has planned to source about 1000 Mega Watt (MW) Solar Power and about 200 MW of wind power progressively by 2021-22 across Zonal Railways & Production Units. Of this, 500 Mega Watt (MW) solar plants are to be installed on the roof top of Railway buildings which will be used to meet non-traction loads at Railway Stations, etc. About 500 MW land based solar plants will be used to meet both traction & non-traction requirements. 

South Central Railway is one of the zones actively implementing several measures aimed at energy conservation by harnessing renewable energy. One of the significant actions taken in this direction has been the installation of solar panels at stations, service buildings, LC gates etc across the zone. Taking this step to the next level, for the first time all the stations in a particular section of the South Central Railway have been provided with solar panels at one stretch to tap the natural energy. This will not only help in meeting power needs of all the stations in the section but also save expenditure for the Railways. 

The Nandyal – Yerraguntla section in Guntakal Division has been declared as the first solar section in South Central Railway. Nandyal – Yerraguntla section is a new railway line laid by Railways and opened for passenger traffic in the year 2016 to bring the hinterland areas into rail map by providing rail connectivity. All the 08 stations in the section – Madduru, Banaganapalle, Koilakuntla, Sanjamala, Nossam, S.Uppalapadu, Jammalamadugu and Proddutur – have been provided with solar panels capable of meeting all the power needs at these railway stations. 

In order to make use of solar power, 37 kWp off Grid Roof Top Solar plants along with 250/125 Wp solar panels have been installed in each station.  In addition, Inverters and 12V 150 AH Battery banks are also installed at all these stations. The total connected load on solar plants is on an average 30 kWp. In total, 152 solar panels have been installed at these stations. With an average exposure of 8 sunny hours per day, 148 KWh energy units can be generated throughout the year resulting in energy generation of 54,020 units. Anticipated savings in terms of revenue is around Rs 5 lakh per annum. Significantly, it also helps in reducing carbon footprint to the tune of 49 metric tonnes per annum thus contributing towards greener environs.

16 stations have already been declared Green Railway stations across Indian Railways, which are meeting energy needs completely either through solar or wind power. These stations are Roha, Pen, Apta in Central Railway, Niamatpur halt, Kanhaipur halt, Teka Bigha halt, Mai halt, Garsanda halt, Niyazipur halt, Dhamaraghat in East Central Railway, Shri Mata Vaisno Devi, Shimla in Northern Railway, Unhel, Khanderi, Bajud, Ambli Road, Sadanapura & Sachin in Western Railway – are 100% Green Powered stations.

                In order to enhance security at Railway stations which are major hubs of transportation, Indian Railways is in the process of installing Internet Protocol (IP) based Video Surveillance System (VSS) at stations, that is, waiting halls, reservation counters, parking areas, main entrance/ exit, platforms, foot over bridges, booking offices etc. Railway Board has approved works for provision of Video Surveillance System covering 983 stations over Indian Railways under Nirbhaya funds. This year a budget of Rs. 250 crore was allotted to Indian Railways from Nirbhaya fund for installation of video surveillance system.

RailTel, a Miniratna PSU under Ministry of Railways, has been entrusted with the work of providing IP based VSS with video analytics and facial recognition system. To have a better coverage and clearer image, four types of Full HD Cameras – Dome type (for indoor areas), Bullet type (for platforms), Pan Tilt Zoom type (for parking areas) and Ultra HD- 4k cameras (for crucial locations) are being provided. CCTV camera live feeds are displayed on multiple screens at the Railway Protection Force (RPF) control room for monitoring. Each HD camera at the station consumes approximately 1TB of data and 4k camera consumes 4 TB data per month. The recording of the video feeds from CCTV cameras will be stored for 30 days for playback, post event analysis and for investigation purposes. Important videos can be stored for longer duration.

Talking about the project of providing Video Surveillance System, Shri Puneet Chawla, Chairman and Managing Director, RailTel said that in the first phase, VSS is being installed at 200 stations Pan India and as on date work has been completed at 81 stations across India. The Video Surveillance System will be extended to other stations and coaches soon. The work is being done utilizing the Nirbhaya fund for ensuring better safety for women. 

In phase-I that is targeted for this year, South Western Railway (SWR) has recently commissioned Video Surveillance system (CCTV) at 6 major stations - Ballari by providing 33 Cameras, Belagavi with 36 Cameras, Vasco-Da Gama with 36 Cameras, Bengaluru Cantt with 21 Cameras, Bangarpet with 36 Cameras, Hassan with 36 Camera and at 3 Stations at Hassan, Shivamogga Town & Sathya Sai Prasanthi Nilayam, work is under progress and will be commissioned shortly. Integrated security systems comprising CCTV have already been installed at 11 stations including Bengaluru with 71 Cameras, Yesvantpur with 35 Cameras, and Mysuru with 34 Cameras. With this SWR has functional CCTV at 17 locations and will complete the work in Phase-I by having CCTV functional at total 20 railway stations by end of January 2020. Security personnel can monitor these cameras not only from station control rooms but also from Central Security Control Rooms located at Divisional HQ, i.e, Hubballi, Mysuru and Bengaluru. 

Internet Protocol (IP) based Video Surveillance System (VSS) has also been installed at 10 Railway stations of Western Railway namely  Bhavnagar Terminus, Udhna, Valsad, Veraval, Nagda, Navsari, Vapi, Viragam, Rajkot, Gandhidham. This Video Surveillance System is expected to ensure better security of passengers at railway stations and railway property.

                Railway Protection Force (RPF) of Indian Railways has taken various steps for administrative reform in the year 2019. Following are the major reforms ushered in to improve the working of RPF:-


	 Consequent on grant of Organized Group ‘A’ status (OGAS) to the Group ‘A’ officer cadre in Railway Protection Force (RPF), the Ministry of Railways has notified the name of the Group ‘A’ cadre mentioned above as Indian Railway Protection Force Service (IRPFS) vide letter no. 2013/E(GR)1/36/10 (Part-I) dated 30.12.2019.  The nomenclature of Group ‘A’ gazetted cadre of RPF as IRPFS does not, in any way, change the name of the force (RPF). The character of the force constituted under RPF (Amendment) Act 1985 (an Act of Parliament) as a statutory Armed Force of the Union remains unchanged.


 


	Constables having received the benefit of 1st MACP/2nd MACP will wear ribbons (V) One Stripe /Two Stripes respectively on the right upper arm of their uniform. This will boost the morale of RPF personnel who remain in the rank of Constables for substantial period as they will look forward to addition of stripes in their uniform without waiting for their promotion to the rank of Head Constables.


 


	The rules and guidelines for functioning of RPF have been compiled as Establishment Manual and Crime Manual superseding all guidelines in force. Soft copies of these manuals have been uploaded in the RPF webpage to make them easily accessible to all RPF personnel. This will streamline the functioning of RPF.


 


	With ever increasing threat to railway system from Left Wing Extremists, terrorist/subversive elements, it is imperative that Railway Protection Force remains  better trained and  prepared  to face growing challenges to railway security. For this very objective, setting up of a separate Commando unit, known as CORAS (Commandos for Railway Security), was announced by Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal on 14th August 2019. 


 

Vision of CORAS is to develop world level capabilities of specialized response for any situation pertaining to damage, disturbance, disruption of train operations, attack/hostage/hijack/disaster situations in railway areas. The training of RPF commandos includes training in physical endurance, Unarmed Combat, Latest weapons training, Disaster management, Anti Terrorist Operations among others. RPF commandos are being utilised for securing railway stations, escorting trains and railway area protection in highly vulnerable areas. 

 


	The benefits available to RPF personnel from Rail Suraksha Kalyan Nidhi were enhanced substantially during 2019. In case of death attributable to death during discharge of duty, the benefit was enhanced from lump-sum grant of Rs 5 Lakhs to Rs 15 lakhs. The vipatti sahayata was also doubled to Rs 4 lakhs for self treatment and Rs 2 lakhs for treatment of family members. Numbers of merit scholarships were enhanced from 1200 to 1500 and enhanced scholarship was started for polytechnic and post graduate courses. Education assistance to handicapped wards was also doubled to Rs 1000 per month.


 


	Promotion to Gazetted Officers: Long pending matter of regularisation of ASCs was resolved in 2019 with regularisation of 97 ASCs in Group A against the vacancies of last 4 years. In addition, a total of 95 officers i.e. 44, 41, 03, 04 and 03 officers were promoted to the rank of ASC, DSC, Sr.DSC, DIG and IG respectively during 2019.


 


	Promotion to Non-gazetted ranks: During the year 2019, 364 Sub Inspectors were promoted to the rank of Inspectors and 2303 Constables were promoted to the rank of Head Constables. Selection of 388 posts of Sub-Inspectors from the rank of Asstt. Sub Inspectors is presently underway and the promotion process of Asstt. inspectors from the rank of Head Constables has been set in motion.


 


	A total of 1121 candidates (male 823 and female 298) were empanelled for recruitment to the post of Sub Inspectors in RPF, out of which initial training of 929 (male 682, female 247) Sub-inspector cadets has already started. Similarly, 8543 candidates (male 4465 and female 4078) were empanelled for recruitment as Constable in RPF, out of which initial training of 5850 (male 3350 and female 2500) constable recruits has already started. The recruitment of 798 Constables (ancillary) and 246 Constables (band) is underway.

                Indian Railways has continuously endeavored to augment passenger experience through modernization and provision of improved facilities over trains and stations. The last fare revision over Indian Railways was done in 2014-15. In order to expand passenger amenities and facilities at railway stations and trains, it has become imperative to increase the fare marginally without over burdening any class of passengers. Further, the burden of 7th Pay Commission on Indian Railway has necessitated rationalization of fares.  Fare revision will help in channelising the fast modernization of Indian Railway.

Accordingly, Railways has decided to marginally effect an increase in fare. Keeping the affordability concerns of daily commuters, there shall be no fare hike for passengers over suburban sections and season ticket holders. This class constitutes 66% of total passenger segment over Indian Railways.  Even for the passengers traveling in Ordinary Non AC Classes, there shall be a marginal increase of 1 paise/PKM (Passenger Kilometer). The increase in fare will be on tickets bought on or after 1st January 2020 and no excess fare (difference of fare) will be charged from passengers who have booked tickets before 1st January 2020. The fare revision is as below:


	Ordinary Non-AC classes(Non-suburban):  Fare  increase by 01 paise/PKM
	Mail/Exp Non-AC classes : Fare increase by  02 paise/PKM 
	AC classes- Fare increase by  04 paise/PKM
	Suburban fare and Season tickets: No increase


 

Existing fares of train services like Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto, Vande Bharat, Tejas, Humsafar, Mahamana, Gatiman, Antyodaya, Garib Rath, Jan Shatabdi, Rajya Rani, Yuva Expresses, Suvidha and special trains on special charges, AC MEMU (non-suburban), AC DEMU (non-suburban) etc shall similarly be revised to the extent of the above proposed increase in class-wise fares.

There shall be no change in charges for reservation fee, superfast surcharge etc. Such charges, wherever applicable, shall continue to be levied additionally. GST as applicable shall be levied, as per instructions issued from time to time.

Indian Railways is constantly striving for up-gradation of amenities to passengers, modernising railway stations and providing state-of-the-art facilities on board and off -board. Rationalisation of passenger fares will boost the endeavours of Indian Railways in the same direction.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways and MSMEs Shri Nitin Gadkari has called for including the road projects in the country into the ambit of insurance. He said, several countries in the world are following the practice of insuring infrastructure projects. These include Canada, Australia, USA, South Africa and UK.

Addressing a Workshop on Motor Vehicle Insurance and Road Safety in New Delhi today, the Minister informed that the Supreme Court has made it mandatory for all new two wheelers to have a five-year third party insurance. Similarly, for cars and commercial vehicles, it is mandatory to have a three-year third party insurance. In case of default, there is a provision of fine up to Rupees two thousand. Under the third party insurance, the responsibility of compensating an accident victim shifts from the vehicle owner to insurance company.

Underlining the importance of insurance, Shri Gadkari said, with a little procedural change in insurance practices, the death rate due to road accidents can be brought down significantly. He said, his Ministry is considering forming a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, which will fund the amount for compensation for hit and run cases. The Fund will also be used for medical treatment of accident victims. He said, the compensation amount in hit and run cases has been increased to Rs 2 lakh, while for the injured people in such cases, it is now Rs 50 thousand. The Minister said, provision has been made in the Motor Vehicles Act to protect those helping the accident victims. The government is also contemplating making provision for protection of doctors, nurses and other medical staff from hassles in such cases, he said.

                Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister for Rood Transport & Highways and MSME along with General (Retd.) V. K. Singh, Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways  reviewed projects of all National Highway development, on 23 and 24 January 2020 at Manesar near Gurugram, Haryana. The review was done state wise. All senior officials of the Ministry, NHAI, State Governments, contractors, concessionaires, and consultants attended the review meeting. Every ongoing project was reviewed with a 360-degree view from all stakeholders. The meeting led to identification of issues and way forward with clear timelines for most of the delayed projects. The major reasons found were delay in land acquisition by State Governments, delay in regulatory clearances such as for quarrying etc. In addition, lack of coordination and communication between and within government agencies continues to delay decision making. About 740 National Highway Projects of 16 States were reviewed.

The Minister Shri Gadkari went into the minutest of detail of every project making sure a clear path forward emerged to speed up projects. Officials and contractors also committed to redoubling of efforts to ensure timely completion of projects.

The issue of timely approval of Extension of Time (EOT) and change of scope (COS) was particularly raised by the Contractors/ Concessionaire. As these timely approvals would help in facilitating lending by banks, an on-line tool called “GATI” has been launched and this will be closely monitored at the highest level. Shri Gadkari also instructed to start performance audit of officer and fix responsibility to delays.

The meeting concluded with all stakeholders committing to impart greater momentum to construction of highways by identifying issues holding up/delaying construction and completion of highways.

In order to carry the momentum of the meeting forward, Sh. Gadkari decided that monitoring and review at the official level needs greater attention and focus. To deal with this issue he has directed all chief engineers in the Ministry and all members of NHAI to organise “Review Mondays” on the first and third Monday of every month. On these days no meetings other than for the purpose of review will be held by officials. Technology and video conferencing will be the means for review and monitoring. These days will be dedicated only for reviews to impart more focus on completing highway projects. Delay in completion of projects has a high probability of leading to claims by contractors and hence the focus on review and monitoring by officials of the ministry will lead to cost savings in addition to timely delivery of projects. 

Interacting with media after the meeting today, the Minister informed  22 Greenfield Corridors  of length 7500 kms is being developed with a total capital cost of Rs. 3.00 lakh crore.  Work has  started on some while awarding all other projects are/ will be completed  expeditiously. These projects are being pursued vigorously and  are being implemented on priority. He added that besides reducing length and decongesting existing NHs, the projects will work as growth engines as they fast through the less developed backward / tribal areas.    The  development of way-side amenities  will  result in more opportunities for business and employment. The minister also added that  the  construction of National Highways in terms of kms per day have been increasing and this is targeted to reach the level of 40 kms per day.

The Minister also informed that the pilot project on convergence of National Highway works and conservation of water in Buldhana district in Maharashtra is running successfully. As many as 152 villages benefitted covering a population of 4,83,360 where 22800 wells were recharged and irrigation facilities increased in 1525 hectares. These details were shared with all the Stakeholders in the review meeting with an aim to implement the scheme in more areas.

He also informed that the progress of FASTags was also reviewed.  All 537 Toll Plazas are now ETC enabled and more than 1.37 cores FASTags have been issued.  My FASTag App has crossed 10 lakh down loads.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways and MSMEs Shri Nitin Gadkari has stressed upon strict adherence to project schedules. Chairing the first day of the two-day long review meeting of NHAI-Ministry projects with Minister of State Gen (Retd) Dr V.K. Singh, officials from the Ministry, NHAI, NHIDCL and State Authorities in Haryana’s Manesar today, the Minister called for adopting best practices in project management and construction. He said, while he is committed to quality, he has zero tolerance towards corruption. He added that any inter-ministerial issues holding up a project may be brought to the notice of the Ministry for his intervention to expedite resolution.

Projects from the Southern and Central zones that include Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry, Telangana, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are among those reviewed today. 

The Minister also launched online Web Portal ‘GATI’ on the occasion. The portal has been created by NHAI taking inspiration from the PRAGATI Portal used by PMO. It can be accessed from NHAI Website and contractors/concessionaires can raise any project related issues on the Portal. The issue will immediately come to the notice of every official of NHAI including top management, and immediate action will be taken by the concerned officer, duly updating on the Portal. The issues raised in the GATI will be daily monitored by a team of officers in NHAI and will be constantly reviewed by the senior officers of NHAI and the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. This will bring transparency and speed up the decision making giving real GATI to highway construction.

A total of 500 projects valued at Rs 3 lakh crore will be reviewed in the following two days. The projects from North-Eastern states, Maharashtra, Uttarkhand, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Laddakh, Haryana, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh will be reviewed tomorrow.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways and MSMEs Shri Nitin Gadkari has lauded the contribution of all stakeholders in NH sector for their contribution in erecting world class road infrastructure in the country. He said, it was their efforts that yielded a record construction length of 29 km per day of NH last year. Giving away the ‘National Highways Excellence Awards’ to outstanding performers in NH sector last evening in New Delhi, the Minister exuded confidence that this record will be surmounted by achieving the construction target of 50 km per day in the coming days.

‘National Highways Excellence Awards’ were instituted in the year 2018. The first cycle of awards in 2018 received wide participation from around the country. Following the success of the first cycle, the Ministry decided to make the National Highways Excellence Awards an annual feature. The aim is to recognise companies which are performing exceptionally well in the construction, operations, maintenance and tolling stages of highway development as well as in the arena of road safety. 

The motive behind starting an annual awards program is to create a spirit of healthy competitiveness amongst all stakeholders involved in the development of highway infrastructure in the country and to contribute to the larger goal of expanding the road network in the country. By announcing awards each year, the Ministry would acknowledge exceptional work being done in various aspects of highway management and recognize those agencies which are going beyond the scope of their work to deliver the finest quality of services.

This year, the nominations were opened on August 19th, 2019. An impartial and independent evaluation process was adopted which had objective and quantifiable assessment parameters. 

The seven award categories are:

1.         Excellence in Project Management, 

2.         Excellence in Operation and Maintenance,

3.         Excellence in Toll Management,

4.         Excellence in Highway Safety,

5.         Innovation,

6.         Outstanding Work in Challenging Conditions, and

7.         Green Highway.

Each award category had its own pre-defined eligibility criteria, assessment parameters and scoring rubrics. This year, 104 applications were received across these seven categories on an online application platform designed by NIC. The applications are spread across the entire country. The assessment was carried out in three months. Each application underwent multiple rounds of scrutiny. First the data and documents submitted by the applicants were evaluated, and then shortlisted projects were visited on-site by a team of trained experts to corroborate the submitted data from findings on the field. Detailed project profiles of the top 40 shortlisted projects were presented before an esteemed jury panel, who checked all the aspects of each projects and finalized 12 winners across the seven categories. 

Toll authorities which have managed the best implementation of FASTag technology were also awarded for increased automation in toll collection.

                Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has decided to relax the conditions regarding declaration of FASTag Fee lanes for 30 days from today at the identified 65 high cash transactions fee plazas of NHAI. The concerned fee plazas have been allowed to convert up to 25 per cent of all fee lanes to hybrid (cash plus FASTag) lanes during this time. 

The move comes in the wake of NHAI raising concerns regarding high cash transactions on its 65 identified fee plazas. NHAI has pointed out that most of the fee plazas are functioning with one hybrid lane on each side and while efforts are being made to bring more fee plazas within the ambit, the said identified fee plazas were facing heavy traffic rush on the hybrid lanes. 

With a view to save the citizens from inconvenience, the Ministry has decided that depending on the traffic pile up at these 65 fee plazas, not more than 25 percent FASTag lane of Fee Plaza may be temporarily converted to hybrid lanes.  This is to be considered and decided on a case to case basis not below the level of the RO concerned. In a directive issued to NHAI in this regard, the Ministry has said that daily evaluation of such cases be made to take necessary corrective action and a summary report on daily basis be sent to the Ministry.  

The Ministry has further asked NHAI to ensure that the least possible number of the declared FASTag lane of Fee Plaza be converted into the hybrid lanes temporarily and further that at least 75% lanes of these 65 fee plaza remain declared and operational as ‘FASTag lane of Fee Plaza’ in order to incentivize the vehicles carrying FASTag.

The Ministry has emphasized that this temporary measure is to be adopted for 30 days only for such 65 fee plazas to facilitate smooth flow of traffic so that no inconvenience is caused to the citizens. NHAI shall take necessary measures within this time to ensure smooth flow of traffic through the fee plazas and ensure declaring “FASTag lane of Fee Plaza” for all the lanes within this period.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways and MSMEs Shri Nitin Gadkari has reiterated his Ministry’s commitment for making roads safer for all the road users. He said, it will continue with the efforts to reduce road accident fatalities through engaging larger communities and stakeholders in various awareness activities on road safety to encourage everyone to join hands in making roads safer. 



Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways and MSMEs Shri Nitin Gadkari, addressing the Road Safety Stakeholders’ Meet in New Delhi today.

Addressing the Road Safety Stakeholders’ Meet in New Delhi today, the Minister called upon the large number of students present in the function to become the brand ambassadors of road safety to bring about the behavioral and transformative change in the youths of the country. He said, youth is the most affected community in the road accidents. Shri Gadkari said, the IRAD project launched by his Ministry will not only enhance the analytical capabilities based on international best practice, but will also help to perform analysis based on collected data for further improvement/corrective measures to be taken at accident spot/accident prone areas by the concerned Road Authority. He said that around 30,000 tablets shall be provided to Police departments of various States/UTs for capturing the accidents related data.

Speaking on this occasion, Defence Minister Shri Rajnath Singh expressed concern at the increasing road accident deaths in the country, saying that the number is far more than the casualties due to natural disasters and terror incidents. He said, it is very painful that nearly 1.5 lakh people lost their lives in road accidents in our country in year 2018, and a lot more got injured. Most of the deaths took place due to over speeding, which has been identified as one of the leading causes behind road accidents resulting in around 97,500 deaths. He said, the trauma of accident not only has financial impact but also impacts victims and their families emotionally and psychologically.  

Shri  Rajnath Singh urged people to make a ‘New Year resolution’ of following safety rules. He appealed to the people to be Good Samaritans instead of mute spectators in helping the victims of road accidents. The Minister called upon youth to use social media, i.e. WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram to raise awareness about the pressing need of road safety. He stressed that the use of TVs and mobiles in cars or while driving has become a menace, adding that science and technology should be used to save lives.

Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways Gen (Retd) Dr V K Singh said that Government is taking all necessary steps for improving the engineering of roads, enforcement, improving emergency care and taking up awareness campaigns for citizens. However, efforts of the Government alone will not suffice and there is a need for the citizens at large to join hands and make road safety a social movement. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has taken earnest steps for reducing the number of road accidents that include rectification of accident black spots, improved road engineering, training of drivers and awareness generation. 

Secretary, Road Transport & Highways, Dr Sanjeev Ranjan said that Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act 2019 is the most important step towards implementation of multi-pronged strategies across various pillars of road safety that is 4E’s. The Act proposes Strict penalties for traffic violations. It also has provision of cashless treatment of accident victims during the golden hour. He further said that Government is also focusing on strengthening E-governance by creating provision for online driving licenses, and online registration of vehicles. Now the Central Government can make rules for the electronic monitoring and enforcement and States Governments can ensure the same on National Highways, State Highways and in Urban cities to ensure road safety using latest technology. In order to increase the effectiveness, the earlier named “District Road Safety Committee” has been reconstituted as “Member of Parliaments’ Road Safety Committee” to enforce measures and promote awareness among road users. Good Samaritans have been encouraged by protecting them from any civil/criminal action and the recent Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, has given legislative backing to the mandate prescribed by the Supreme Court, and the Guidelines and SOP issued by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.

A road safety pledge was also administered to all present in the function by the Minister for Road Transport & Highways and MSMEs Shri Nitin Gadkari and Defence Minister Shri Rajnath Singh. A short film called ‘Rehana’ for creating awareness amongst the road users regarding the Good Samaritan law has also been released on this occasion.

Based up on the Road Accident Report 2018 published by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, the State of Tamil Nadu, which has registered maximum reduction in accident related deaths of 3941 in 2018 with respect to 2017 registering a decline 24.4% over the previous year, has been adjudged the Best Performing State in terms of Road safety. Recognising the commendable work done by the State, the Ministers gave away the award of “Best Performing State in Road Safety” to Tamil Nadu which was received by the team from the State led by Shri M.R. Vijayabaskar, Minister for Transport.

Shri Rajnath Singh and Shri Nitin Gadkari also launched Ministry’s new project called Integrated Road Accident Database (IRAD) today, a robust road accident database management system developed and being implemented with the help of Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, NIC and supported by World bank. This will enable the States and Centre to comprehend the information related to road accidents, analyses the root cause of road accidents and to develop and implement ‘data-led’ road safety interventions to reduce the accidents. Accidents data is the basis for assessing road safety scenarios and for implementing required interventions to reduce accidents. Accident database is the first step towards achieving scientific road safety management. An ideal database needs to be comprehensive so as to meet not only the statistical requirements but also assist in planning accident reduction measures.

This system can collect data across the country on different types of roads i.e. National highways, state highways, city roads etc. IRAD will be a comprehensive web-based IT solution and will enable various agencies such as Police, PWDs, NHAI etc. to enter details on a road accident from different perspectives such as investigation, road engineering, vehicle condition etc. The details so entered, shall enable various authorities to run different types of analysis and understand the dynamics of road accidents in India and hence help them to launch targeted measures in fields of enforcement, engineering, education and emergency care to improve road safety situation in India. This system shall be first launched in the six States which are having the highest fatalities in terms of road accident related death i.e. Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. Regional Vice President of the World Bank for South Asia, Transport Commissioners of States, Additional Director Generals of Police of States, Dean (IC&SR) IIT, Madras and DG (NIC) were also present on this occasion.

                A special drive has been initiated for removal of all sorts of speed breakers on National Highways. The step comes in a bid to ensure smooth and hassle-free traffic movement, especially at toll plazas. With the effective implementation of FASTag on toll plazas and conversion of cash toll lanes to FASTag lanes, the speed breakers/ rumble strips constructed at toll plazas are being removed with immediate effect for smooth vehicular movement.

Roads of different categories and under different situations are designed for designated speeds at which vehicles can travel with convenience and safety.  At certain locations, control of speed becomes necessary to promote orderly traffic movement and improved safety.  Considering the fact that National Highways are designed to cater to high speed traffic without any hindrance, the drive to remove speed breakers from national highways under the jurisdiction of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).  

The speed breakers result in considerable delay, damage to the vehicles and significant discomfort to vehicle occupants and more fuel consumption due to acceleration and deceleration.  This initiative will save time, money and facilitate smooth vehicular movement especially to ambulances, elderly and unwell people commuting on National Highways. In the larger context, this will also ensure avoidable wastage of transportation fuel for which country is heavily import-dependent, and will also result in lesser pollution. 

Electronic Toll Collection through FASTag has been implemented from 15th December 2019 to provide commotion-free movement on highways.  Positive effects of ETC are being realized by the commuters on toll plazas.  Introduction of speed breakers-free highways is another step in commitment to provide safe, smooth and seamless journey to commuters on National Highways.

                              *Achievement till Nov, 2019

Targets for 2019-20

        Award         -     10,000 Km

      Construction –    11,000 Km

Under ToT mode, a bundle of 9 projects with total length of 566 km has been awarded this Financial Year for a concession fee of Rs. 5,011 crores against the reserve price of Rs. 4,998.71 crore. Further initiatives are being taken up to bid out more projects under TOT mode during this Financial Year.

Accelerated Development of Highways

The Ministry proposes to develop additional 60,000 kms of National Highways in the next five years, of which 2500 km are Express Ways/Access Controlled Highways, 9000 kms Economic Corridors, 2000 kms for Coastal and Port Connectivity Highways and 2000 kms Border Road/ Strategic Highways. The Ministry also intends to improve connectivity for 100 tourist destinations and construct Bypasses for 45 towns/cities during this period.

Expenditure of Ministry increased from 33,745 crore in 2013-14 to Rs. 1,37,354 crore in 2018-19. During the current year an expenditure of Rs. 85,275 crore has already been incurred till November 2019 including IEBR of NHAI.

Augmenting Finances through Innovative Instruments 

With a view to augmenting sources of funding for NH projects, the NHAI intends to raise Rupees one lakh crore through Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) Model of asset monetization in the next five years. Finances are also likely to accrue from Securitization of Toll Revenues as well as the setting up of Infra Investment Trust (InvIT). Other steps being taken by NHAI include financing new projects through National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) supported SPVs.

Toll Operate Transfer (TOT) and Securitization of user fee receipts of NHs

With a view to expanding the project base available with NHAI for monetization under TOT mode and for raising finance against toll receipts from identified Public Funded/Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) projects through securitization, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has accorded the following approval (vide communication no. CCEA/20/2019 (i) dated 25.11.2019 ):

NHAI is authorized to monetize public funded NH projects which are operational and are collecting toll for at least one year after the COD through the Toll Operate Transfer (TOT) on a case to case basis. 

NHAI is authorized to vary the Concession Period between 15 to 30 years depending on project features. 

The detailed proposal for every TOT bundle, including the proposed project stretches; estimated concession value & proposed concession period shall be approved by NHAI Board (Authority). 

NHAI is allowed to raise long term finance from banks by securitizing the user fee receipts from fee plazas as alternate mode of asset monetization.

Securitization would offer an alternative mode for raising finance against toll receipts from identified Public Funded/HAM projects. Securitization as a model entails the generation of upfront funds against the future cash flows generated by select assets. 

Infrastructure Investment Trusts 

In order to enhance NHAI’s resource mobilization, the Cabinet has accorded the following approval (vide communication 39/CM/2019(i) dated 13.12.2019):

NHAI is authorized to set up Infrastructure Investment Trust(s), as per InvIT Guidelines issued by SEBI, to monetize completed National Highways that have a toll collection track record of at least one year and NHAI reserves the right to levy toll on the identified highway. 

NHAI is authorized to incorporate SPV(s) which are essential and integral part of the entire InvIT structure. 

NHAI is authorized to set up its first InvIT as per the structure approved by NHAI Board and to incorporate two SPVs which are essential and integral part of the InvIT structure:


	An SPV to hold all identified public funded projects to be placed in an InvIT
	An SPV to act as an Investment Manager in the proposed InvIT


NHAI is authorized to create a reserve fund from the sums received from InvIT, which shall be kept in a separate account for repayment of debt. 

Progress of Major Programmes/ Landmark Projects

The work of major bridge across Sharavathi backwaters, approaches between Ambargodu and Kalasvali in Karnataka and 16 packages of Trans Rajasthan Highways project have been awarded. 

A three-lane underpass inaugurated at Parade Road junction near Manekshaw Centre on NH 8 in New Delhi on 12.07.2019.  With opening of this underpass, movement of traffic from Airport to Dhaula Kuan has become signal free. 

Dasna-Hapur section of Delhi-Meerut Expressway (package-3) in Uttar Pradesh’s Pilakhuwa has been inaugurated by the Hon’ble Minister, Shri Nitin Gadkari on 30th September, 2019.  The completion of this section is expected to further help in decongesting the National Capital Region, bring down pollution levels and reduce travel time significantly. 

The integrated bus ports in Cuttack (Odisha) and in Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) have been approved and the DPRs thereon are under progress. 

 

National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) program 

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has launched National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) program which provides for collection of user fee through FASTags based on RFID technology. In order to save fuel, time and pollution and to ensure seamless movement of traffic, it has been decided to enable all lanes in Fee Plazas for electronic toll collection program through FASTags. The Tolling systems would be spruced up to create a digital experience of seamless tolling for all the Highway users. 

The Ministry vide letter dated 29th November, 2019 initiated the process of declaring “FASTag lane of Fee Plaza” for all the lane to be complied w.e.f. 15th December, 2019. However, considering the request of NHAI and that the Citizens inconvenience this condition has been eased for the next 30 days. It has been accordingly decided that depending on the traffic pile up at high traffic volume fee plazas, not more than 25% “FASTag lane of Fee Plaza” may be converted temporarily to hybrid lane by the RO concerned. It should also be ensured that least possible number be converted into hybrid lane and that at least 75% lanes of every fee plaza remain declared and operational as “FASTag lane of Fee Plaza” in order to incentivize the vehicles carrying FASTag. A total of 1,11,70,811 FASTag have been issued till 26.12.2019. 

 

Ministry is trying to bring inter-operability of the FASTags with the State Governments so that a single FASTag can be used both at State Highways Toll Plaza and National Highways Toll Plaza. An NHAI Prepaid Wallet was also launched giving customers the choice of not linking their FASTag to their bank accounts and includes the feature of UPI recharge.

 

Discouraging the use of ‘Single-Use Plastic’

This Ministry has directed all offices/officers/staff to stop use of ‘Single-Use Plastic’ in office premises, and also to use locally produced environment-friendly products such as Kulhads, clay glasses/plates etc. in place of harmful plastic products.

 Swachhata hi Seva Campaign (SHS)

The Government decided that in 2019-20, the ‘Swachhata hi Seva Campaign (SHS)’ 2019 between 11th September, 2019 to 27th October, 2019 will focus on Plastic Waste Management as the main theme.  For the campaign, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways prepared a detailed Action Plan and the personnel undertook Shramdaan and ensured the collection of all plastic waste on and around National Highways.  Efforts for awareness generation were also successful; roughly 69,000 people were mobilized, and shramdaan of around 2,22,226 lac-man hours was done during the campaign. Waste plastic has been used in 56.96 km of road length by Nov, 2019.  More roads are being constructed using plastic waste.

 

Road Safety

State Support Programme

A State Support Programme aimed at incentivising the States to improve their road safety performance is proposed to launched to reduce the overall fatalities by road accidents by 25% by 2024. With a view to accurately recording the accident details so that timely corrective action is undertaken a Geo-Tagged accident data collection programme would be launched under the project “Integrated Road Accident Database (IRAD)”. IT based road safety infrastructure would be erected on all the four lane and above Highways. Incidence management systems shall also be provided on all such Highways.

Department of Rural Development holds workshop on ‘Road Safety’ with State Governments to share best practices and increase awareness among masses 

The Union Government along with the State Governments have been implementing various measures to make Indian roads safer. Given the magnitude and gravity of the problem, there is a need for the society at large to take cognizance of the issue and to join hands to make road safety a social movement. To give stakeholders an opportunity to take part in concerted action the ""National Road Safety Week"" is observed throughout the country every year. In line with this objective, the Road Safety Week is being observed from 11th January to 17th January 2020 with the theme ""Bringing Change Through Youth"". 

The Department of Rural Development is a key player in ensuring road safety as 70.23% of total roads in India are passing through and connecting rural India. To ensure that rural roads become safer, the Department held a workshop on ‘Road Safety’ with State Governments and other stakeholders in order to ensure that the best practices that emerge from States can be adopted by other States and more awareness can be generated among rural India on how to improve road safety. The workshop was held to disseminate information among States and increase awareness so as to propel the economy forward and reduce the loss of lives andproperty which has a substantial impact on the GDP.

The main topics which were discussed and deliberated upon during the conference includes:


	Better quality roads so as to improve mobility and reduce damage 
	Better visibility by ensuring lesser serpentine S-shaped roads and more straight ones including ideal road geometrics
	Road furniture such as walls on both sides of the roads, fences, road studs, speed bumps & reflectors on sides of the roads and many more safety devices.
	Better Signage to effectively inform the drivers as well as pedestriansabout the road and its contours such as reflective sheeting sign boards, thermoplastic road markings-beam crash barriers, over-head boards etc.


A short video clip was also shown at the workshop on Road Safety with a special message from the Union Minister for Rural Development, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar wherein he said thatroad accidents are of grave concern and the nation is losing lakhs of people every year in these accidents, mostly youth. Shri Tomar emphasized that prevention of road accidents is national priority and under third phase of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Union Government shall make continuous efforts in this direction and expect contribution of Engineers also towards achieving this objective.

The Union Minister addedthat roads should be constructed with an understanding that their users are human beings who may commit mistakes. Therefore, roads should be capable of preventing small mistakes converting into big accidents. Shri Tomar said that these days, there is a concept of “Forgiving Roads” all over the world and for this purpose emphasis will be given on capacity building of Engineers and contractors.

Accident Prevention is a national Priority, especially under PMGSY-III.  Involvement of community in all the States through advocacy, meeting and awareness campaigns is critical in accident prevention.There is also an intrinsic need to conduct road safety audit of some of the critical roads for which a training programme to train engineers as Road Safety Auditors is also needed whichwill beundertaken in coordination with AITD and IAHE.

Gandhiji was a prolific writer. He believed in the importance of communicating through letters. Throughout his life, he wrote letters to his family, friends, associates, national and international leaders; wrote in many languages that he knew; and wrote about topics close to his heart, expressing his deepest thoughts. Three of his letters are shown in this exhibit augmented by an AR experience through the mobile AR app “Digital Gandhi Gyan Vigyan”, to be downloaded from the Google play store.


	Gandhiji’s Travels AR Experience


 



 

Mahatma Gandhi travelled across the length and breadth of India, inspiring people everywhere. This AR experience shows some locations and their connection with Mahatma Gandhi.  A Physical map of India is shown in this exhibit augmented byan AR experience through the mobile AR app “Digital Gandhi Gyan Vigyan”, to be downloaded from the Google play store.


	3D Printed Gandhi Mementos (Statue and Signatures) augmented with an AR App.




One of the mementos is a 3D printed statue of Mahatma Gandhi in a walking posture with a 3D printed model of his signature in English. The replica is made by using a 3D scan model of the Statue of Mahatma Gandhi located at the entrance of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The original sculpture was created by renowned Indian sculptor Ram Vanji Sutar. This sculpture exemplifies Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals of peace, justice, simplicity, minimalism and relentless action-oriented determination to achieve his goals – one of them being the independence of India. The replica is 3D printed in PLA, a bio-degradable plastic material, using additive manufacturing. 

The smaller memento is a 3D printed replica of the English signatures of Mahatma Gandhi along with a line drawing of him in a walking posture. 

Both these mementos comewith an Augmented Reality app called Digital GandhiAkar PrakaAR, which can be downloaded from Google Play Store and used by starting the app and pointing the camera of an android device (phone or tablet) at the Gandhi statue/signature. The Hindi phrase Akar Prakar  means “Dimensions”, and this app provides an insight into the different dimensions of Mahatma Gandhi’s life and teachings.

Congratulating the joint organizers of Vigyan Samagam for organizing this Exhibition. Dr Paul Ho, a world - renowned Astrophysicist and Director General of East Asian Observatory shared his experience about the first image of a supermassive black hole, ""The Event Horizon Telescope, a network of 8 radio telescopes, operating at millimeter-wavelengths, and spanning the surface of the earth, has successfully produced the first picture of a black hole. We achieved the highest angular resolution in astronomy by using the Very Long Baseline Interferometry. This Supermassive Black Hole, in the nucleus of the M87 galaxy, is the first case where we can resolve the event horizon, where even light itself cannot escape from the gravity of the black hole.""

Shri K. N. Vyas, Chairman, AEC and Secretary, DAE, said that it has been an exciting time during the entire journey of Vigyan Samagam and we are extremely proud to have the final edition in New Delhi. He said that our objective throughout the exhibition has been to showcase to the people of India, that how science can influence, specially our youngsters, in this changing world, which is beyond imagination. The distinct objective of organizing an exhibition of a global stature was to showcase the journey from the origin of the universe, the nature of particles we are made from and fundamental science, he said. 

Prof. Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology (DST) said that India is diligently preparing to be well versed in the area of innovations and experiments, the new generation is focused and will stop at nothing to secure a respectable position for India in world Science domain.

                Foreign Minister of Denmark, Mr. Jeppe Kofod, visited the Barapullah DESMI Project Site here yesterday to understand the challenges in the area of waste water management and to discuss the scope of Danish technologies and collaboration with research institutions which may be engaged in this area. He was accompanied by Dr. Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology (DBT).

Foreign Minister made commitment with Secretary, DBT to have Indo-Danish partnership which would be a strong underpinning for strengthening the collaboration in area of waste water management and green transition.

The Barapullah drain is one of the main water transport ways in New Delhi that collects water from various smaller water drains from all over the city. It is mainly used for waste water and sewage transport. Because of the high population density, water scarcity and size of the waste water flow, the Barapullah drain is an excellent location for research in the area of waste water management.

Considering sewage/ sludge management as an important issue, DBT, Ministry of Science & Technology, Government of India initiated a novel holistic clean-up project in collaboration with DESMI EnviRO-CLEAN A/S, Denmark in January, 2019 at Sun Dial Park in Sarai Kale Khan area.

The aim of the project is to trap the floating debris from the drain and convert it into value added products. The purpose of this project is to prove the sustainability of the process with suitable gasification/ carbonisation technology to mitigate waste of mixed feedstock, collected from rivers or lakes besides reducing the damage to the local environment.

Key Features:

• Percentage of floating debris will reduce in Barapullah drain

• Sustainable source of energy can be produced on site

• Benefitting local environment and community

• Local employment

• Clean Indian Rivers

• Project leads and Research befits to water, energy and waste sector of India

• Supporting local manufacturing Industry - Make in India

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today called upon the scientific community to find long-term solutions to the problems faced by farmers and improve crop productivity and farmers’ income. He also wanted scientists to explore ways to make crops climate-resilient, nutrition-efficient and less water consuming.

He was delivering the Valedictory address at the 107th Indian Science Congress at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru. The Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri B.S. Yediyurappa, the General President, Indian Science Congress Association, Prof. K.S. Rangappa, the Vice-Chancellor of University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, Dr. S. Rajendra Prasad and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that global warming and climate change were affecting the weather patterns in an unpredictable manner and causing massive devastation at times. He sought to know from the scientists whether the problems faced by farmers due to nature’s fury could be mitigated.

Calling for concerted efforts, Shri Naidu emphasized upon the critical role of technology in enhancing both the quality and quantity across the agriculture value chain from the use of inputs at the pre-production stage to post-production and marketing to improve the income of farmers.

The Vice President, while noting how technology was making our lives more comfortable, said that at the same time new challenges were arising. He said science must find solutions to problems like increasing urbanization, pollution, urban-rural divide, growing antibacterial resistance, genetic & non-communicable diseases and water scarcity, among others.

Urging schools to lay the foundation for the spread of a strong scientific culture in the country, he stressed that such a foundation would become the basis for creating an ecosystem for creativity and innovation to thrive.

“The need of the hour is to foster the spirit of inquisitiveness, curiosity and scientific temper right from the primary school level”, he said.

Observing that there was a crying need for our universities and scientific institutions to promote R & D on a big scale, the Vice President called for expanding the academia-industry linkage to promote research and innovation in a big way. Technological innovation was a key driver in boosting economy, improving people’s lives and enabling better delivery of services he added.

“India like no other country has a huge demographic dividend and can emerge as the innovation and knowledge if our universities and scientific institutions invest more on R & D and significantly the raise the standards of research”, Shri Naidu stressed.

The Vice President also urged the corporate India to develop a symbiotic partnership with the universities and to identify and fund a dozen futuristic projects.

Opining that India was surging forward with renewed vigour and enthusiasm, the Vice President said that it must leverage the demographic opportunity with science and technology playing a leading role in driving the economic and social development in order to make the country a $ 5 trillion economy.

Shri Naidu lauded the government initiatives such as Make in India, Digital India and Start-Up India that promote indigenous manufacturing, empower people digitally and wealth-creation through innovation. He wanted senior scientists to mentor and hand-hold the young ones to benefit from such schemes and realize their scientific and entrepreneurial potential.

While addressing the gathering, the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri B.S. Yediyurappa said that the farming community must be given utmost priority in scientific innovations so that farmers will get benefitted. He urged the scientific community to include social angle in their science research. He congratulated the University for Agricultural Research, Bengaluru for successfully conducting the mega science event.

The Vice President presented the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) Awards, Young Scientist Awards and Best Poster Awards to the winners on this occasion.

                The Farmer’s Science Congress was inaugurated for the first time in the 107 years of history of the Indian Science Congress, highlighting the importance of farmer’s innovations and their scientific validity. 

While inaugurating Farmers Science Congress, Dr. Trilochan Mohapatra, Secretary, Department of Agricultural Research and Education & Director General Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), here today, said that it is for the first time in the history of Indian Science Congress that a farmer centric event has been organized, which is a big encouragement for the farmer’s community.

Dr. Mohapatra mentioned about the paradigm shift from production and nutrition security to doubling of farmers’ income by 2022. This shift in thinking was the result of a call given by the Prime Minister.

Dr. Mohapatra stressed on the benefits for farmers from such a platform and said that innovators from different parts of the country can share their experiences and learn from each other. “Scientist-farmer interactions can boost innovations to the next level and this can benefit the people in general,” he added.

Dr. Mohapatra called on school students to attend the Farmer’s Science Congress, so that interest in agriculture can be created right from the school level through interactions.

“ICAR has developed 56 models of integrated farming, which will be promoted with NABARD by linking them to the Rural Development programmes,” he pointed out.

Dr. Mohapatra informed that Farmers Innovation Fund and Innovation Centres will be set up to encourage innovations made by progressive farmers. To encourage organic farming, 45 types of organic farming systems have also been developed in niche areas. ""If we can give some support to their innovations by way of financial support, innovation validation and market linkage, farmers will be encouraged to to take them forward,"" he added.

He also said that to reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers, ICAR are developing Nano fertilizers and nano pesticides to promote organic farming. 

“To improve rural bio-economy and attract youth to agriculture, a programme named Arya is being implemented. Till now over 5000 youth have been brought into this programme in which they have been trained to be entrepreneurs and begin a start up, Around 104 such startups are marketing processed food items,” he said.

The Chairman of Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission, Shri Hanumanagouda Belagurki emphasized on the challenges in the agriculture sector and said that there is a need to introduce economy and social sciences as part of agricultural science in the agriculture universities. 

Farmers Science Congress was organized as a part of the ongoing 107th Indian Science Congress at University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru. Around 120 innovative farmers from across the country are participating in Farmers Science Congress and showcase their products.

Experts from the different agriculture sector discussed on three themes; Farmers innovation on integrated agriculture and entrepreneurship for doubling farmers income; Climate change, bio-diversity, conservation, ecosystem services & farmers empowerment and Agrarian distress, rural bio-entrepreneurship, policy issues in a day event.

                Bharat Ratna, Professor C.N.R. Rao has said that the future of the country depended on science and technology and the future of science lay on the children who with their hard work and sincerity can work wonders in science. He was addressing the inaugural session of the Rashtriya Kishore Vaigyanik Sammelan (Children’s Science Congress), a part of the ongoing 107th Indian Science Congress being held at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru today. Eminent Scientists from India and abroad called on the numerous children gathered at the event to be determined, believe in themselves and be prepared for unexpected results in their pursuit of science. 

Professor, Ada Yonath from Israel, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009 advised the young children that in science everything would not go the way they want and that they should be prepared for the unexpected. “Even if things do not go your way, believe in yourselves and do not look for advice from others” she added.  

She recalled that as a child she wanted to pursue science as a hobby and had set up her experiment to measure the height of the ceiling of her balcony.

She referred to the inspiration which she received from Professor G.N. Ramachandran, FRS who was known for the formulation of the Ramachandran plot for understanding peptide structure and for proposing the triple-helical model for the structure of collagen. “I had thought that I had lost the first experiment as a scientist, but that experiment was later presented by my guide at a conference in India and appreciated by Professor Ramachandran. 

He stressed that science does not require degrees but dedication, doggedness and tenacity and mentioned that many of the great scientists like Michael Faraday, had made phenomenal contributions without degrees. 

He also mentioned the timeless work of great Indian scientists like Sir C.V. Raman, Srinivasa Ramanujan and Professor J.C. Bose who went out of their way and carried out scientific research despite constraints of time, finance and facilities.

The Rashtriya Kishore Vaigyanik Sammelan (Children’s Science Congress) prominent event of the Indian Science Congress, was inaugurated by the Nobel Laureate Prof. Ada Yonath, Bharat Ratna Prof C.N.R. Rao in the presence of Dr. Akhilesh Gupta, Head, NCSTS, Department of Science and Technology (DST) and other dignitaries. 

Children Science Congress is financially supported by NCSTC, DST. The main objective is to provide a unique opportunity to children of the age group of 10-17 years to use their scientific temperament and knowledge and to quench their thirst for creativity by conducting scientific experiments to solve problems identified by them. The students also get an opportunity to interact with scientists and subject experts. 

Every year about 7-8 lakhs school children in the age group of 10-17 years participate at various levels from the districts, states & union territories. Around 2 to 3 best projects from each state are exhibited in the Indian Science Congress. Several projects made by students are being showcased in the University of Agricultural Science campus and students had the opportunity to listen and interact with the Young Scientists and Nobel Laureates.

During the event, Infosys ISCA Travel Award 2020 was also given to top 10 students for their best write ups for innovations in the field of Science & Technology.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the 107th Indian Science Congress (ISC) today at University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru.

Delivering the inaugural address, the Prime Minister said, “The growth story of India depends on its achievements in the Science & Technology sector. There is a need to revolutionise the landscape of Indian Science Technology and Innovation.”

“My motto for the young scientists bourgeoning in this country has been – “Innovate, Patent, Produce and Prosper”. He said these four steps will lead India towards a faster development. “Innovation for the people and by the people is direction of our ‘New India”, he added.

He said, “New India needs technology and also a logical temperament, so that we can give a new direction to our social and economic sectors”. He said science and technology provides a level playing field in making opportunities accessible to all and that it also plays a unifying role in the society.

Prime Minister said, “Now the developments in information and communication technology are able to provide cheaper smart phones & cheaper data and that has made it accessible to everyone in the country, where as it was seen as a privilege of the few earlier. This made the common man now believe that he is not distantly separated from the Government. Now he can directly connect with the Government and make his voice heard”

Prime Minister exhorted the young scientists to work in the field of rural development where there are several opportunities for cheaper and better innovations.

Referring to the theme of 107th ISC - “Science and Technology: Rural Development”, the Prime Minister said that it is only due to Science & Technology, that Government Programmes have reached the needy. 

He highlighted that India now stands at 3rd position globally, in the number of Peer-reviewed Science and Engineering Publications. “I have been told that India has climbed to third position globally in the number of peer reviewed science and engineering publications. It is also growing at a rate of about 10% as compared to global average of 4%”, he said.

He also mentioned about Improvement in India’s ranking at Innovation Index to 52. He highlighted that Government programmes have created more incubators in the last 5 years than in previous 50 years.

Prime Minister said Technology is being harnessed at a large scale to achieve the objective of Good Governance. “Yesterday our Government was able to release to 6 crore beneficiaries the instalment under the PM-KISAN programme. This was possible only due the Aadhaar enabled technology”, he said. Similarly he said that it was technology which helped in building toilets and providing electricity to the poor. He said that owing to the technology of Geo Tagging and Data Science, many of the projects in rural and urban areas could be timely completed.

Prime Minister said, “We are continuing our efforts to ensure the ‘Ease of doing Science’ and effectively using information technology to reduce red tape”.

He emphasized that Digitalisation, E Commerce, Internet Banking and Mobile Banking services are assisting rural population significantly. He said Technology can be harnessed for several rural development initiatives, particularly in the area of cost effective Agriculture and Farm to Consumer supply chain network.

He urged everyone to find technological solutions for - stalk burning, maintenance of Ground water tables, prevention of communicable diseases, environment friendly transportation etc. He emphasized that Science and technology has a major role in contributing towards making India a $5 Trillion Economy.

The Prime Minister launched the Indian Scientific, Technology and Engineering facilities Map (I-STEM) Portal on this occasion.

The Union Minister for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences and Health and Family Welfare, Dr. Harsh Vardhan highlighted that as per a recent National Science Foundation (USA) Report, India has already climbed to the third spot in the number of science and engineering publications and that Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advance Scientific Research (JNCASR) in Bangalore has scored the 7th position in the quality of research by Nature Index.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also emphasized that several schemes have been worked out for enhancing the quality of research, empowering young women students and scientists, technology development, creation of an end-to-end startup ecosystem, bringing the best of global science to India, linking of academia-research labs-industry-society, sharing of scientific resources and science communication.

He pointed out that our innovation ecosystem in the last five years has doubled from the previous fifty years and that the Scientific Social Responsibility Policy has been formulated to reach out to the widest-spectrum of stakeholders of S&T with knowledge, human resources and infrastructure.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for the Model Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for unilateral/bilateral recognition of Certificates, pursuant to Regulation  1/10 of International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) for Seafarers, 1978 as amended to be signed between the Directorate General of Shipping, Government of India and its counterparts in foreign countries, with the approval of Minister-in-charge of Shipping and the Minister of External Affairs.  

Benefits

The unilateral MoU would facilitate unilateral recognition by another country of the certificates issued by the Directorate General of Shipping to Indian seafarers, without seeking similar recognition by India of the certificates issued by that country. 

Indian Seafarers, therefore, will be eligible to be placed on ships under the flag of that country for employment, thus leading to increased employment opportunities. The proposed bilateral MoU will enable India and another country with which such an MoU may be entered, to mutually recognize maritime education and training, certificates of competency, endorsements, documentary evidence of training and medical fitness certificates, issued to the seafarers who are citizens of respective countries in accordance with the provisions of regulation 1/10 of the STCW Convention.  

The bilateral MoU would therefore, make the seafarers of both the countries to be eligible for employment on ships of either party based on the certificates so recognized.  India being a seafarer supplying nation with large pool of trained seafarers will stand to be benefitted.

Shri Modi termed that it is a privilege to be a part of the 150th anniversary celebrations of the KoPT a historic symbol of the country's water power.

 

""This port has stood witness to many a historical moment in the country like India getting independence from foreign rule. From Satyagraha to Swachhagraha, this port has seen the country changing. This port has not only seen consignors, but also the carriers of knowledge who have left a mark on the country and the world. In a way, this port of Kolkata symbolizes India's aspiration for industrial, spiritual and self-reliance"", the Prime Minister added.

The Prime Minister also launched the Port Anthem during the event.

PM stated that the long coast line of India from Gujarat's Lothal Port to Kolkata Port was not only engaged in trade and business but also in spread of civilization and culture across the world.

""Our government believes that our coasts are gateways to development. This is the reason the government started Sagarmala project for modernizing infrastructure and improving connectivity of the Ports. Thirty six hundred projects worth more than Rs 6 lakh crore have been identified under this scheme. Out of these, more than 200 projects worth more than Rs 3 lakh crore are underway and about one hundred twenty five have been completed. Kolkata Port is connected to the industrial centers of eastern India due to the construction of river waterways. And trade has become easier with countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar"", PM added.

I also remember Babasaheb Ambedkar. Dr. Mukherjee and Baba Saheb gave a new vision to post-independence India"", PM said.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the extension of the term of the Commission to examine the issue of Sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes, by six months that is up to 31.7.2020. 

The Cabinet has also approved addition of following Term of Reference to the existing Terms of Reference of the ""Commission"" -

“iv. to study the various Entries in the ""Central List of OBCs and recommend correction of any repetitions, ambiguities, inconsistencies and errors of spelling or transcription.""

 

Impact:

The Communities in the existing list of OBCs which have not been able to get any major benefit of the scheme of reservation for OBCs for appointment in Central Government posts & for admission in Central Government Educational Institutions are expected to be benefitted upon implementation of the recommendations of the Commission. The Commission is likely to make recommendations for benefit of such marginalized communities in the Central List of OBCs.

 

Financial Implications: 

The expenditure involved are related to the establishment and administration costs of the Commission, which would continue to be borne by the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment.

 

Benefits:

All persons belonging to the castes/communities which are included in the Central List of SEBCs but which have not been able to get any major benefit of the existing scheme of reservation for OBCs in Central Government posts & for admission in Central Government Educational Institutions would be benefitted. 

 

Implementation strategy and targets:

Orders for extension of the term of the Commission and addition in its Terms of Reference will be notified in the Gazette 'in the form of an Order made by the President, after receipt of the approval of the Hon'ble President to the same.

 

Background: 

The Commission was constituted under article 340 of the Constitution with the approval of President on 2nd  October, 2017. The Commission, headed by Justice (Retd.) Smt. G. Rohini commenced functioning on 11th October, 2017 and has since interacted with all the Stats/UTs which have subcategorized OBCs, and the State Backward Classes Commissions. The Commission has come to the view that it would require some more time to submit, its report since the repetitions, ambiguities, inconsistencies and errors of spelling or transcription etc appearing in the existing Central List of OBCs need to be cleared. Hence the Commission has sought extension of its term by six, that is upto 31st July 2020 and also addition in its existing Terms of Reference.

                The National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has released the First Revised Estimates of National Income, Consumption Expenditure, Saving and Capital Formation for the financial year 2018-19 along with Second Revised Estimates for the financial year 2017-18 and Third Revised Estimates for the financial year 2016-17 (with Base Year 2011-12) as per the revision policy *. Earlier estimates for 2011-12 to 2017-18 were released vide press note dated 31st January, 2019 and Provisional Estimates of 2018-19 were released on 31st May, 2019.

2.         The First Revised Estimates for the year 2018-19 have been compiled using industry-wise/institution-wise detailed information instead of using the benchmark-indicator method employed at the time of release of Provisional Estimates on 31st May, 2019. The estimates of GDP and other aggregates for the years 2016-17 and 2017-18 have undergone revisions on account of use of latest available data on agricultural production; industrial production (provisional results of Annual Survey of Industries (ASI): 2017-18 and final results of ASI: 2016-17); government expenditure (replacing revised estimates with actuals for the year 2017-18); comprehensive data available from various source agencies like Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) etc. and additional data from State/UT Directorates of Economics and Statistics. 

3.         The salient features of the estimates at aggregate level are given in the paras that follow.

Gross Domestic Product

4.         Nominal GDP or GDP at current prices for the year 2018-19 is estimated as ₹ 189.71 lakh crore against ₹ 170.98 lakh crore for the year 2017-18, showing a growth of 11.0 per cent during 2018-19 as compared to 11.1 per cent during 2017-18.

5.         Real GDP or GDP at constant (2011-12) prices for the years 2018-19 and 2017-18 stand at ₹ 139.81 lakh crore and ₹ 131.75 lakh crore, respectively, showing growth of 6.1 per cent during  2018-19 and 7.0 per cent during 2017-18. 

 

Industry-wise Analysis

6.         Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices in different sectors of the economy at current and constant (2011-12) prices are presented in Statements 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. At the aggregate level, nominal GVA at basic prices has grown by 11.1 per cent during 2017-18 against 10.5 per cent during 2018-19. In terms of real GVA i.e. GVA at constant (2011-12) basic prices, there has been a growth of 6.0 per cent in 2018-19, as against 6.6 per cent in 2017-18.

7.         The shares of broad sectors of the economy in terms of overall GVA during 2011-12 to 2018-19 and the annual growth rates are mentioned below:

8.         The growth in real GVA during 2018-19 has been lower than that in 2017-18 mainly due to relatively lower growth in ‘Agriculture, Forestry & Fishing’, ‘Mining and Quarrying’, ‘Manufacturing’, ‘Electricity, Gas, Water Supply & Other Utility Services’, ‘Financial Services, ‘Public Administration and Defense’ and ‘Other Services’ as may be seen from Statement 4.2. During 2018-19, at constant prices, the growth rates of Primary (comprising Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Mining & Quarrying), Secondary (comprising Manufacturing, Electricity, Gas, Water Supply & Other Utility Services, and Construction) and Tertiary (Services) sectors have been estimated as 1.0 per cent, 6.0 per cent and 7.7 as against a growth of 5.8 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 6.9 per cent, respectively, in the previous year.

 

Net National Income

9.         Nominal Net National Income (NNI) at current prices for the year 2018-19 stands at ₹ 167.89 lakh crore as against ₹ 151.50 lakh crore in 2017-18, showing growth of 10.8 per cent during 2018-19 as against 11.2 per cent in the previous year.

 

Gross National Disposable Income

10.       Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) at current prices is estimated as ₹  192.63 lakh crore for the year 2018-19, while the estimate for the year 2017-18 stands at ₹  173.19 lakh crore, showing a  growth of 11.2 per cent for year 2018-19 as against 11.1 per cent in the year 2017-18. 

 

Saving

11.       Gross Saving during 2018-19 is estimated at ₹ 57.13 lakh crore against ₹ 55.38 lakh crore during 2017-18. Rate of Gross Saving to GNDI for 2018-19 is estimated at 29.7 per cent against 32.0 per cent for 2017-18. 

12.       The highest contributor to Gross Saving has been the household sector, with saving of ₹ 34.47 lakh crore in the year 2018-19. The saving of private financial corporations has increased from ₹ 1.50 lakh crore in 2017-18 to ₹ 1.77 lakh crore in 2018-19 whereas the saving of the non-financial corporations marginally decreased from ₹ 20.69 lakh crore during 2017-18 to ₹  20.60 lakh crore in 2018-19. The saving of General Government was (-) ₹ 1.96 lakh crore during 2017-18 and (-) ₹ 1.48 lakh crore in 2018-19.

 

Capital Formation

13.       Gross Capital Formation (GCF) at the current as well as the constant prices is estimated by two approaches :– (i) through flow of funds, derived as Gross Saving plus net capital flow from Rest of the World (RoW); and (ii) by the commodity flow approach, derived by the type of assets. The estimates of GCF through the flow of funds approach are treated as the firmer estimates. GCF by industry of use and by institutional sectors does not include ‘valuables’ and therefore, these estimates are lower than the estimates available from commodity flow approach.

 

14.       GCF at current prices is estimated at ₹ 61.09 lakh crore for the year 2018-19 compared to ₹ 58.49 lakh crore during 2017-18. The rate of GCF to GDP is 34.2 per cent during 2017-18 as against 32.2 per cent in the 2018-19. The rate of GCF (excluding valuables) to GDP stands at 32.9 per cent and 31.1 per cent for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively. The rates of capital formation in the years 2011-12 to 2018-19 have been higher than the rate of saving because of positive net capital flow from RoW.

 

15.       In terms of the share to the total GCF (at current prices), the highest contributor is Non-Financial Corporations, and the same has increased from 47.7 per cent in 2017-18 to 49.0 per cent in 2018-19. Share of household sector in GCF has declined from 37.9 per cent in 2017-18 to 37.5 per cent in 2018-19 while the share of General Government in GCF has increased from 12.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 12.7 per cent in 2018-19.

 

16.       Within the GCF at current prices, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) amounted to ₹  54.93 lakh crore in 2018-19 against ₹  47.99 lakh crore in 2017-18. The rate of GFCF to GDP at current prices has increased from 28.1 per cent in 2017-18 to 29.0 per cent in 2018-19. The change in stocks of inventories, at current prices, increased from ₹ 2.51 lakh crore in 2017-18 to ₹ 3.20 lakh crore in 2018-19, while the valuables decreased from ₹ 2.19 lakh crore in 2017-18 to ₹ 2.00 lakh crore in 2018-19.

 

17.       The rate of GCF to GDP at constant (2011-12) prices was 37.6 per cent in 2017-18 and 35.6 per cent in 2018-19.

 

Consumption Expenditure 

18.       Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) at current prices is estimated at ₹ 112.54 lakh crore for the year 2018-19 as against ₹ 100.91 lakh crore in 2017-18. In relation to GDP, the rates of PFCE at current prices during 2017-18 and 2018-19 are 59.0 per cent and 59.3 per cent respectively.

 

19.       At constant (2011-12) prices, the PFCE is estimated as ₹ 73.80 lakh crore and ₹ 79.08 lakh crore, respectively for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19. The corresponding rates of PFCE to GDP for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 are 56.0 per cent and 56.6 per cent respectively.

 

20.       Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) at current prices is estimated as ₹ 21.04 lakh crore for the year 2018-19 as against ₹ 18.38 lakh crore during 2017-18. At constant (2011-12) prices the estimates of GFCE for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 stand at ₹  13.43 lakh crore and ₹  14.79 lakh crore respectively.

 

Per Capita Estimates

21.       Per Capita Income i.e. Per Capita Net National Income at current prices, is estimated as ₹ 1,15,293 and ₹ 1,26,521 respectively for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19. Per Capita PFCE at current prices, for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 is estimated at ₹ 76,794 and ₹ 84,808 respectively.

 

Summary of Revisions in the GDP Estimates

23.       The use of latest available data from various agencies has resulted in some changes in both the levels of GVA and growth estimates for the years 2016-17 and 2017-18. The reasons for revisions in the estimates of the years 2016-17 and 2017-18, released earlier on 31.05.2019 are mentioned in the Annexure.

NOTES ON THE STATEMENTS

FORMULAE


	GVA at basic prices (Production Approach) = Output at basic price – Intermediate Consumption
	GVA at basic prices(Income Approach) = CE + OS/MI + CFC + Production taxes less Production subsidies(i)
	GDP = ∑ GVA at basic prices + Product taxes less Product subsidies(ii)
	NDP/NNI = GDP/GNI - CFC
	GNI = GDP + Net primary income from ROW (Receipts less payments)
	Primary Incomes = CE + Property and Entrepreneurial Income
	NNDI =NNI + other current transfers from ROW, net (Receipts less payments)
	GNDI = NNDI + CFC = GNI + other current transfers(iii) from ROW, net (Receipts less payments)
	Gross Capital Formation(iv)= Gross Savings+ Net Capital Inflow from ROW
	GCF = GFCF + CIS + Valuables + “Errors and Omissions”
	Gross Disposable Income of Govt. = GFCE + Gross Saving of General Government
	Gross Disposable Income (GDI) of Households = GNDI – GDI of Govt. – Gross Savings of All Corporations


 

REMARKS ON THE FORMULAE


	Production taxes or subsidies are paid or received with relation to production and are independent of the volume of actual production. Some examples are:


Production Taxes - Land Revenues, Stamps & Registration fees and Tax on profession

Production Subsidies - Subsidies to Railways, Subsidies to village and small industries.


	Product taxes or subsidies are paid or received on per unit of product. Some examples are:


Product Taxes- Excise duties, Sales tax, Service Tax and Import Export duties

Product Subsidies- Food, Petroleum and fertilizer subsidies.


	Other Current Transfers refers to current transfers other than the primary incomes
	Estimate of GCF derived from this formula is taken as the “firmer” estimate and the difference between this estimate and the sum of GFCF, CIS and valuables is taken as “errors and omissions”, as referred in 10 above.

                The National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has released the First Advance Estimates of National Income at both Constant (2011-12) and Current Prices, for the financial year 2019-20 along with the corresponding estimates of expenditure components of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

 

2.         The First Advance Estimates of GDP have been released in accordance with the release calendar of National Accounts. The approach for compiling the Advance Estimates is based on Benchmark-Indicator method. The sector-wise Estimates are obtained by extrapolation of  indicators like (i) Index of Industrial Production (IIP) of first 7 months of the financial year, (ii) financial performance of Listed Companies in the Private Corporate sector available upto quarter ending September, 2019 (iii) 1st Advance Estimates of Crop production, (iv) accounts of  Central & State Governments, information on indicators like Deposits & Credits, Passenger and Freight earnings of Railways, Passengers and Cargo handled by Civil Aviation, Cargo handled at major Sea Ports, Sales of Commercial Vehicles, etc., available for first 8 months of the financial year. With the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1st July 2017 and consequent changes in the tax structure, the total Tax Revenue used for GDP compilation include non-GST revenue and GST revenue. For the year 2019-20, the Budget Estimates of Tax Revenue as provided by Controller General of Accounts (CGA) have been used for estimating taxes on products at Current Prices.  For compiling taxes on products at Constant Prices, volume extrapolation is done using volume growth of taxed goods and services and aggregated to get the total volume of taxes. Annual forecast of indicators which are available for first 7 / 8 months is based on Regression using seasonal dummies to account for seasonal fluctuations or some indicators like IIP have been compiled by dividing the cumulative value for the first 7 months of the current financial year by average of ratio of cumulative value of 7 months to the annual value of past years. The salient features of the Estimates are detailed below:

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today launched a scheme of SAIL to promote Voluntary Philanthropist Activities (VPA) by its employees.    The scheme called “SAIL Employee Rendering Voluntarism and Initiatives for
Community Engagement (SERVICE)” will promote and facilitate philanthropist activities by the employees in a structured manner.  



The Minister also launched a portal for the employees to register for the scheme. The dedicated interactive “SAIL SERVICE” portal for implementation of this Scheme shall act as a platform for enabling faster interaction and communication amongst the various stakeholders.  It shall eventually be developed as a repository of knowledge management in this regard.



Speaking on the occasion, ShriDharmendraPradhan said that it is a great initiative of SAIL to encourage its employees and their families to give back to society in a positive manner.  He said “This year marks 70 years of our Constitution coming into effect. Honorable President of India ShriRamnathKovindji has said that while being alert about their rights, citizens should also be conscious of their duties. Through SERVICE, employees of SAIL will come forward to perform their social duties voluntarily and contribute towards social welfare and nation building.”

ShriPradhan called for mass scale mobilisation of employees towards achieving social good through voluntary activities, based on their interest areas. He said that the SAIL employees and their families can contribute in nation building and community development.  He called upon the SAIL employees to participate in this Scheme whole-heartedly andmake the habit of helping others an integral part of their lives.He also called for incentivising initiatives taken by employees aimed towards social welfare.

There are about 70,000 regular employees of SAIL and 60,000 contractual employees in various plants of SAIL.  All these employees and their families will be encouraged to come forward and undertake such VPA for community development.  They will be encouraged to undertake Voluntary Philanthropist Activities preferably under the identified thrust areas under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).  These include education and health, women empowerment, sustainable income generation, assistance to Divyangjan, access to water and sanitation, village development, environment sustenance, sports coaching, and traditional arts and culture.  The Scheme may also promote other related VPAs by employees which should not be related to any other organisation or receiving any funding from any organisation.

SAIL will undertake mass mobilisation programmes in its plants and units to spread awareness about this scheme and to encourage employees to participate in VPS.  A pledge shall be administered at all plants and units of SAIL on the SAIL Foundation Day i.e. 24th January for VPS towards community development.

SAIL shall provide logistic support to such employees or groups for undertaking the VPAs, subject to evaluation and assessment.   Due recognition will also be given for the employees or groups under the scheme, based on their contribution.  

On this occasion, Shri Anil Kumar Chaudhary, Chairman, SAIL, also apprised the media about the SERVICE scheme.

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today launched PURVODAYA: Accelerated development of eastern India through integrated steel hub in Kolkata, West Bengal.

Shri Pradhan speaking on the occasion said “Whether it is our freedom movement or social reform, eastern India has provided leadership to the nation. Eastern India is a land of infinite opportunities. Despite being endowed with natural resources, this region has lagged behind in socio-economic development as compared to some other parts of the country. Today, we start Purvodaya in steel sector, a new chapter which will script the rise of eastern India by accelerated development of steel sector through an integrated steel hub.”



Speaking about Government’s efforts to develop eastern India, he said, “Our Government under the leadership of Hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given unprecedented focus to the development of eastern India. About half of aspirational districts are in this region which is becoming hotspots of socio-economic development. Our Government has come up with a Rs. 102 lakh crore worth of National Infrastructure Pipeline. Whether it is pipelines, inland waterways, shipping, air or road, our Government is building infrastructure at an unprecedented pace. Eastern India holds special focus in our infrastructure development efforts.”

About technology, Shri Pradhan said, “21st century is going to be the age of knowledge and technology. New technologies are reshaping the economy and society. Industry 4.0 driven by digitisation holds immense promise. Embrace of Industry 4.0 by manufacturing in steel sector will ensure eastern India benefits from the wave of Industrial Revolution 4.0.”

Stressing upon the need of  improving business climate, he said, “Ease of Doing Business is not mere slogan for our Government. From setting up companies to  regulatory clearances, taxation etc., our Government has worked on every aspect of improving the Ease of doing Business. Recently, our Government came up with perhaps the biggest ever reform in the coal sector. More revenue, more production and logistic development in the coal sector will further fuel the growth of Eastern India.”

Purvodaya in steel sector is aimed at driving accelerated development of Eastern India through establishment of integrated steel hub. Eastern states of India (Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal) and Northern part of Andhra Pradesh collectively hold ~80% of the country’s iron ore, ~100% of coking coal and significant portion of chromite, bauxite and dolomite reserves. There is presence of major ports such as Paradip, Haldia, Vizag, Kolkata etc., with >30% of India’s major port capacity. In India’s march towards a $5 trillion economy, the 5 Eastern states can play a major role where steel sector can become the catalyst. This Eastern belt has the potential to add more than 75% of the country’s incremental steel capacity envisioned by the National Steel Policy. It is expected that out of the 300 MT capacity by 2030-31, over 200 MT can come from this region alone, driven by Industry 4.0.

The proposed Integrated Steel Hub, encompassing Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Northern Andhra Pradesh, would serve as a torchbearer for socio-economic growth of Eastern India. The objective of this hub would be to enable swift capacity addition and improve overall competitiveness of steel producers both in terms of cost and quality. The Integrated Steel Hub would focus on 3 key elements:

1. Capacity addition through easing the setup of Greenfield steel plants

2. Development of steel clusters near integrated steel plants as well as demand centres. 3. Transformation of logistics and utilities infrastructure which would change the socio-economic landscape in the East                       

Growth of steel industry through such a hub would lead to significant employment opportunities across the entire value chain and will play a significant role in overall socio-economic growth of Eastern India, thus reducing the disparity between the East and other regions of the country.

Smt. Rasika Chaube, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Steel, Ms. Vandana Yadav, Secretary, Industries, Govt. of West Bengal, Shri Hemanth Sharma, Secretary, Industries, Govt. of Odisha, Shri Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, Indian Oil, Shri Anil Chaudhary, Chairman, SAIL, Shri Anil Kumar Jha, Chairman, Coal India, Shri Chandrajit Banerjee, DG, CII, Shri S.K. Behera, MD, RSB Ltd. also addressed the audience.

                Ministry of steel in partnership with CII and JPC is organising the launch of Purvodaya-Accelerated Development of Eastern Region through an Integrated Steel hub, in line with Prime Minister's Vision  for focused development of the Eastern States. Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minster for Petroleum & Natural Gas and Steel will launch the Purvodaya on 11th January 2020 at The Oberoi Grand Kolkata. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has highlighted the need for focused development of the Eastern states in order to unleash their untapped potential thereby ensuring the growth of the region as a whole and the country at large.

Creation of such a world-class steel hub would significantly contribute to Purvodaya by propelling socio-economic development in the Eastern region. Steel capacity addition as envisioned in the hub would entail capital investments of >70 Bn. $ and lead to an incremental GSDP of >35 Bn. $ through steel alone. Growth of steel industry through such a hub would lead to significant employment opportunities across the entire value chain, creating over 2.5 Million jobs in the region. Creation of world-class logistics and utilities infrastructure would also spur development of other manufacturing industries across sectors. This would also be accompanied by social infrastructure in the form of cities, schools, hospitals, skilling centres etc. Such development, especially in the most under-developed regions in these states, will play a significant role in overall socio-economic growth of Eastern India, thus reducing the disparity between the East and other regions of the country.

Background

The Eastern region of India, though extremely rich in resources, lags behind other states in terms of development. Eastern states of India (Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Northern Andhra Pradesh) collectively hold ~80% of the country’s iron ore, ~100% of coking coal and significant portion of chromite, bauxite and dolomite reserves. In addition to its rich mineral reserves, these states also have a significant locational advantage. There is a presence of major ports such as Paradip, Haldia, Vizag, Kolkata etc. with >30% of India’s major port capacity, 3 major National Waterways as well as strong road, rail connectivity to most parts of the country. Despite these advantages, these states are currently behind many other Indian states in terms of economic and development indicators such as GSDP per capita and Human Development Index (HDI).

In India’s march towards a $5 trillion economy, the 5 Eastern states can play a major role where steel sector can become the catalyst. The presence of natural resources, coupled with an already established steel industry, presents an excellent opportunity for Eastern India to spearhead the expected growth in the domestic steel industry, the region at large and the country as a whole. This Eastern belt has the potential to add more than 75% of the country’s incremental steel capacity envisioned by the National Steel Policy. It is expected that out of the 300 MT capacity by 2030-31, over 200 MT can come from this region alone, driven by Industry 4.0.Rs.100 lakh crore infrastructure investment announced by the Government in the next 5 years will result in additional boost to construction and infrastructure through various initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Jal Jeevan Mission, Sagarmala, Bharatmala, etc. Steel industry has a multiplier effect in the GDP as well as in employment. These States would march ahead on the development index because of which the Ministry of Steel has envisioned an Integrated Steel Hub in this region, which will serve as a catalyst in the transformation of Eastern India by developing a vibrant steel industry.

  Integrated  Steel  Hub

The  proposed  Integrated  Steel  Hub, encompassing  Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Northern Andhra Pradesh, would serve as a torchbearer for socio-economic growth of Eastern India.

The objective of this hub would be to enable swift capacity addition and improve overall competitiveness of steel producers both in terms of cost and quality. In addition to increased steel capacity, this hub would also help enhance best-in- class value addition capabilities. The Integrated Steel Hub would focus on 3 key elements:

 


	Capacity addition through easing the setup of greenfield steel plants
	Development of steel clusters near integrated steel plants as well as demand centres
	Transformation of logistics and utilities infrastructure which would change the socio-economic landscape in the East


These elements would be supported through additional enablers such as ensured availability of raw materials, presence of supporting industries such as capital goods and well-established avenues for skill development.

Steps Taken by Ministry of Steel

Various steps to make this hub a reality are already being taken by the Ministry. The Central Ministries, the State Governments and Private Players across the spectrum are allied to the cause of Purvodaya. The following actions have already been initiated by the Ministry of Steel, in co-ordination with the various stakeholders:

 


	A policy facilitating the creation and upgradation of steel clusters has been put up after due consultation with Central Ministries, State Governments and industry. Kalinganagar and Bokaro have been identified as pilot locations for steel clusters around ISPs. Task Forces and Working Groups, with the support of the respective State Governments, have been created. Detailed planning for operationalization of these clusters is currently underway.
	In an effort to ease capacity addition through greenfield route, a framework policy is being created to address the challenges faced in land acquisition, raw material linkage and obtaining
	This being done in consultation with Central Government Ministries, State Governments and industry stakeholders.
	Critical logistics and infrastructure projects are being identified for expedition across the 12 major steel zones identified in the region (Kalinganagar, Angul, Rourkela, Jharsuguda, Nagarnar, Bhilai, Raipur, Jamshedpur, Bokaro, Durgapur, Kolkata, Vizag). These include major rail, road and port capacity expansion projects to debottleneck existing capacity and create world-class multimodal logistics infrastructure across these zones.

                To mark of 25 years of the adoption of Beijing Platform for Action, Ministry of Women & Child Development (MWCD), the National Commission for Women (NCW) and UN Women organized a National Consultation on the Review of Beijing+25, to galvanize all stakeholders to implement actions that remove the most conspicuous barriers to gender equality. The aim of the consultation was to bring together civil society and the women and youth of India, gender equality advocates from all walks of life, in a national public conversation on the urgent actions that need to be taken for the realization of gender equality. 

The inaugural session was attended by Governor of Chhattisgarh, Smt. Anusuiya Uikey, Secretary Ministry of women and Child development, Rabindra Panwar and Ms, Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, National Commission for Women.

The objectives of the Consultation were to assess progress and challenges to the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in India over the past 5 year, discuss lessons learned, priority actions required to realized gender equality and the empowerment of women by 2030, discuss emerging areas that have impact on women’s empowerment.

The 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, was one of the largest ever gatherings of the United Nations, and a critical turning point in the world’s focus on gender equality and the empowerment of women.

2020 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995), (Beijing + 25). A quarter of a century on, several innovations and progress has been made on many fronts across the 12 critical areas of concern of the BPfA.

Under the helm of Ministry of Women and Child Development, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao was expanded to all 640 districts resulting in a 13-point improvement in the sex ratio from 918 (2014-15) to 931 (2018-19), the female net enrolment ratio of 93.55 percent at the elementary level and a significant decline in the overall drop-out rate to 19.8% for boys and girls. Over 17.43 lakh women were reached out under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY Maternity Benefit Programme) and over 18.6 lakh were addressed through Women Helpline Number (181) across country as on September 2018. To improve the overall gender responsiveness of the police and encourage participation of women in the force, advisory have been issued to increase representation of women to 33 percent resulting in extension of reservation in 15 additional States in the last 5 years.  Further, to strengthen the ecosystem for working women and encourage economic participation, extension of maternity leave duration from 12 to 26 weeks and compulsory establishment of crèche in work spaces have been effectuated through legislative amendment.

The Economic Survey 2019-20 has stated that the access to Nutrition and Electricity resulted in higher growth rate in India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and new firm creation in Service Sector is far greater than that in Manufacturing, Infrastructure or Agriculture. The Survey was tabled by the Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, in the Parliament,today.

Saying that the GDP growth is critical variable for decision-making by investors as well as policymakers, the Economic Survey highlighted the recent debate about whether India’s GDP is correctly estimated following the revision in estimation methodology in 2011 is extremely significant. The Survey carefully examined the evidence, leveraging existing scholarly literature and econometric methods to study whether India’s GDP growth is higher than it would have been and concluded that using careful statistical and econometric analysis, it finds no evidence of miss-estimation of India’s GDP growth.

The Survey highlighted the need to invest in ramping up India’s statistical infrastructure is undoubted. It also said that India has made impressive improvements in several social development indicators.

The Survey discusses about countries differ in several observed and unobserved ways, cross-country comparisons have to be undertaken with care to separate out the effect of other confounding factors and isolate the effect of the methodology revision alone on GDP growth estimates. 

The Survey observed that India has taken several initiatives to foster investment like relaxing FDI norms, cutting corporate taxes, containing inflation, accelerating infrastructure creation, improving ease of doing business or reforming taxation etc. As India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, investors see an unparalleled opportunity here, it said. The level and growth rate of a country’s GDP informs several critical policy initiatives by serving as a barometer of the country’s size and health, it added. 

The Survey critically discussed the micro-level evidence which examined new firm creation in the formal sector across 504 districts in India. The granular evidence shows that a 10 per cent increase in new firm creation increases district-level GDP growth by 108 per cent, it added.

                The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) has termed media reports about figures of disruption in adoption cases during last five years as incorrect. It said that in recent days, there have been a number of media reports giving the figures of disruption in adoption cases as 1100 during the last five years. In a clarification issued in New Delhi, the CARA saidthat the actual figures are 246 cases of disruption and 10 cases of dissolution over the period of last five years. 

The Central Adoption Resource Authority said that it appears thefigure of 1100 has been misquoted from the RTI response given by it, which also included the figures of withdrawal from the adoption process. It further stated that disruption implies returning back of the children to the institution after being placed with a family and is not a happy situation as the children face rejection and are scarred for a long time. There have also been 10 cases of dissolutions during the last five years, where the parents returned the child after concluding the legal adoption process through adoption order by the court. The total number of disruption and dissolution reported have been less than 2% of the total adoptions under the JJ Act, 2015 and not approximately 6% as has been reported by the print media.

There is a difference between parents withdrawing from the adoption process after accepting the profile of a child referred for various reasons, and those who return the child after taking them in pre-adoption foster care, which is called disruption. While the former is about helping parents take an informed decision of adopting the child, the latter is completely detrimental to the best interest of the child which is the guiding principle for any organisation working for children. In order to check this trend, CARA has formed a sub-committee of experts who have been travelling to different States to help them in building the capacity of social workers at the gross root level. 

CARA is an apex body of Government of India under the Ministry of Women and Child Developmentfor promoting and facilitating in-country adoptions and is the designated Central Authority for regulating inter-country adoptions.

The Minister further stated that all the pending approvals for the developmental work in J&K have been cleared, farmers have been compensated for their crop losses and many thousand kilometres of roads have been constructed under PMGSY. She further said that all the centrally sponsored schemes and programmes will be given top priority in J&K.

Stating that democracy at the grass root level is the need of the hour for the development of J&K, the Minister reiterated that the conduct of Block Development Council Elections in J&K was a historical step which has empowered people and given them a say in the decision making in the local Government. She further said that the Panchayat elections that were held in 2018, despite various challenges, proves that J&K desires development in every sphere and believes in the policies and programmes of the Government.

During her visit, the Minister also laid the foundation stone of two road projects from Machaini- Domana to Chibba Chowk and from Gajansoo to Lohrichak Rathana.

Various delegations called on the Minister of State for Women and Child Development and submitted memorandum of their demands and problems, which include issues like 4 percent reservation quota and separate schools for physically challenged community and all other facilities which are applicable in different States and UTs for welfare of Divyangjan persons.

                Adoption is no longer an act of bringing a child home but it is a legal process where all the rights and privileges of a child are safeguarded along with the transfer of responsibilities to adoptive parents in a legal manner said Union Minister of Women and Child Development (WCD), Smriti Zubin Irani in New Delhi today.  She further said that a large number of parents are waiting to adopt, even as the total number of reported adoptions is less when compared to the figures of destitute and orphan children in the country. The WCD Minister was speaking at the National Consultation on Adoption organized by Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), a statutory body of Ministry of Women and Child Development.

Smriti Zubin Irani urged all stakeholders that deliberations must lead to the way forward in order to improve the implementation of the adoption programme thereby ensuring the best interest of the children. She further said that the Government is committed to take all measures to ensure a bright future for the children of the country.

Officials and stakeholders from all States and UTs participated in the consultations.  Major issues deliberated upon during the national consultation were simplification of the adoption process, bringing more children in need of care and protection into the adoption pool, rehabilitation of older and special needs children and issues related to adoption being faced by the implementing agencies and state bodies. 

The consultation was attended by Secretary WCD, Rabindra Panwar, CEO and Member Secretary CARA, Deepak Kumar and other senior officials from the Government of India.

Emphasising that Article 370 was the real impediment towards the development of the erstwhile state, the Minister said that the youth of J&K have been deprived of sports opportunities in the past or otherwise the Union Territory of J&K would have been a great destination for sports.The minister said that participation in every sport would have been more from J&K if the sports infrastructure had been improved in the past. He said, “the day has come when all the pending approvals related to sports or infrastructure will be cleared by the central government and a new sunrise in the development will be shown to the UT of J&K”.

Shri Rijijuinformed that the government has decided to organize winter games at Gulmarg and Srinagar in February, and will also explore opportunities for water sports in the UT. He also said that the youth should take sports as a career so that India would be at the top of all the sports competitions in the world, be it Olympic Games or other competitions.



 

Referring to the special task force for Olympics constituted by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Minister said that the target has been set for Tokyo Olympics and Paris Olympics.He said, “We cannot be satisfied now with just 2 or 3 medals when this country has 65 percent youth population. The need of the hour is to bring in new changes in the sports, its infrastructure and training.” He also emphasised on the identification of the talent so that world champions could be made in India. 

Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, the Minster said that India lives in villages and by this special public outreach programme, the whole cabinet has come to the doorsteps of common masses inside villages and blocks to meet people directly, listen to their grievances andreceive  their feedback so as to implement the centrally sponsored schemes efficiently. Shri Rijijureiterated that a new dawn of development would be set in the UT of J&K. He said people now should compare the pace of development before and after the abrogation of Article 370. 

Earlier the Minister inaugurated a CFC building at Chakroi and a Sub Centre at Chak-Mullo being constructed under Border Area Development Cluster Programme. The Minister distributed sports kits to various youth clubs and also inaugurated a Kabaddi and a Volley ball tournament at sports stadium Chakroi.

                Haryana topped the  medals tally in Khelo India Youth Games at Guwahati  today.Pumped up by four gold in kabaddi, three each in archery and athletics and one each from cycling and gymnastics,Haryana amassed 17 gold after Day 4 to jump from Number 6 to Number 1. 

Maharashtra picked up only four gold to manage a tally of 16 to slip to the second position. They have a total of 71 medals, though, as opposed to Haryana’s 47, to set up a thrilling race to the finish.The defending champions, Maharashtra, were well served by Aditee AjitDandekar (Girls Under-21 Individual all-Around rhythmic gymnastics) and their 4x100m relay quartet but they could only watch as Haryana went for the kill across sports.

Haryana dominated kabaddi but were surprisingly taken to the wire by Himachal Pradesh in the Girls Under-21 final; the hill State, in fact, rallied from a six-point deficit at half-time to tie the scores at 27-27 at the end of regulation time. 

Last year’s runners-up Haryana had to dig deep into the reserves of their strength and experience to sneak home in extra-time.

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu stole the limelight in athletics, with an equally impressive five-gold show; Kerala’s AncySojan too made an impact, anchoring her State’s Under-21 4x100m relay squad to collect her third gold medal.

Three of Tamil Nadu’s gold medals came in jumps, through S Saran (Boys Under-21 long jump), Pavithra (Girls Under-21 pole vault) and Babisha (Girls Under-21 triple jump). Their gold tally has swelled to seven from track and field, taking them to the fifth place with 8 gold out of 25 medals. Delhi and Gujarat occupied the third and fourth spots.

Haryana dominated archery too, winning 7 medals including 3 gold. HimaniKumari, who missed out on a medal in Pune last year, claimed the Girls Under-21 title with an easy win in the final. TishaPunia, a quarterfinalist last time, beat her team-mate Tamanna in the Under-17 final while Ridhi took the bronze to ensure a sweep for them in this category.

Madhya Pradesh’s compound archers MuskanKirar (Girls Under-21) and Chirag Vidyarthi (Boys Under-17) bettered their last year’s performances to bag gold medals this time. Chirag Vidyarthi had to hold his nerves in securing a 1-point win against Rajasthan’s Rajesh Bishnoi.

Haryana cyclist Anil Manglaw secured the most comfortable victory in the road races held on Monday. Assam’s GongutriBordoloi won the Girls Under-21 road race (60km) in a stirring finish that saw the podium finishers separated only by 0.15 seconds. Similarly, Delhi’s Arshad Farid and Maharashtra’s Pooja Danole outsprinted their rivals in the Under-17 races but only just.

Gujarat’s Rushiraj Jadeja, a student of the District Level Sports School in Ahmedabad, finished sixth in qualification but came into his own to win the Boys Under-21 10m Air Rifle gold from home favourite Hridhay Hazarika.

Parth Makhija (Delhi), who topped qualifying with 630.6 finished fifth, three sub-10 shots hurting him.

Rudraksh Patil (Maharashtra) took the other gold on offer in the shooting ranges on Monday, the 10m Air Rifle for Boys Under-17 with a consistent showing both in qualifying (627.2 points) and in the final where he beat KevalPrajapati (Gujarat) quite comfortably.

Gujarat’s judokas showed their growing prowess on the mat to win three of the eight gold medals on offer in the Under-21 competition. Seven of the state’s 10 gold medals have come from the Judo competition. While Gujarat’s sustained efforts to rake in medals hogged the limelight, Mizoram’s Chinglinmawaii caught attention by winning the Girls Under-21 52kg class for her State’s second gold in all.

                Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and State Government of Uttar Pradesh are jointly organizing 23rd National Youth Festival (NYF) 2020 at Indira Pratishthan, Lucknow from 12th to 16th January, 2020. Chief Minister, Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath   and Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs & Sports, Shri Kiren Rijiju will inaugurate the  NYF 2020  on 12th January on the occasion of birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, the great Youth icon. The inauguration will be followed by cultural/musical performance by local and renowned artists. 

The closing ceremony of the festival on 16th January will be graced by the Governor of Uttar Pradesh and Shri Kiren Rijiju.

The Government has been organizing National Youth Festival (NYF) since 1995. The objective of NYF is to provide a platform to bring the youth of the country together in an attempt to provide them opportunity to showcase their talents in various activities. It also provides an arena, by creating a mini-India, where youth interact in formal and informal settings and exchange their social and cultural uniqueness. This blend of diverse socio-cultural milieu proves the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s commitment and belief in  ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat’.

The theme of the 23rd National Youth Festival 2020 is ‘FIT YOUTH FIT INDIA’ in pursuance of the goal of Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi for New India to be a fit India. NYF 2020 would leverage on the knowledge and ideas that Youth of today bring to the table where they are hugely connected and integrated through online and offline communication channels than ever before. The NYF 2020 intends to focus on bringing the attention of the Youth towards dialogue and discussions on selected thematic interfaces so that the outcome feeds into a National Level. 

The National Youth Festival is like a mega National Integration Camp. NYF 2020 would have around 6000 participants (volunteers from NYKS, NSS and local youth) from each State of the country. As the theme of 2020 NYF suggests, the youth will inculcate physical activity and sports in their everyday lives which is essential to make new India a Fit India. 

From 13th January to 16th January, different Competitive (Folk Dance, One Act Play, Hindustani Vocal Solo, Carnatic Vocal Solo, Elocution, harmonium Light, Tabla, Mridangam, Veena, Flute, Sitar, Guitar, Dances Manipuri, Odissi, Kuchupuri, Bharatnatyam, Kathak) and Non Competitive Events (Young Artist Camp, Yuva Kriti, Food festival, Adventure Camp, Suvichar, Youth Convention) will be organized.

                NITI Aayog released its vision for the National Data and Analytics Platform (NDAP) today. The platform aims to democratize access to publicly available government data. It will host the latest datasets from various government websites, present them coherently, and provide tools for analytics and visualization. NDAP will follow a user-centric approach and will enable data access in a simple and intuitive portal tailored to the needs of a variety of stakeholders.

NDAP will spearhead the standardization of formats in which data is presented across sectors and will cater to a wide audience of policymakers, researchers, innovators, data scientists, journalists and citizens.

The vision document was released by Dr Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog, in the presence of Mr Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, senior officials from various ministries and state governments, academics and researchers.

In his opening remarks, Dr Rajiv Kumar said, ‘India has made tremendous progress in generating and using data for policymaking and programme implementation. It is now time to build on these efforts to further strengthen the data ecosystem. I am certain that NDAP, with its mission to be a one-stop and user-friendly data platform, will go a long way in transforming India’s data ecosystem.’

Mr Amitabh Kant explained the context for the development of NDAP, ‘NITI Aayog has always promoted and championed the use of data in all spheres of governance. It is therefore natural that NITI Aayog takes the lead in providing the nation with a simple and compelling platform where various datasets can be accessed together. This has been a longstanding gap in the data ecosystem, which NITI Aayog is now seeking to try and address.’

Senior Adviser Anna Roy, who is leading this initiative within NITI Aayog, expounded the need for NDAP: ‘We are seeking to address three main gaps. One, all datasets are not published in a user-centric manner that is analyzable and visually presented. Two, there are a multitude of datasets out there that is not easily accessible. The NDAP proposes a simple, interactive, visual, and robust platform that will host various Central and state government datasets.’

An inter-ministerial committee will oversee the progress of the development of platform and a group of leading experts have been inducted into an advisory group to provide technical guidance for the development of the platform. The success of the endeavour is dependent on the cooperation and support of various stakeholders.

The development of NDAP will take place over a period of one year. The first version of the platform is expected to be launched in 2021. The process will follow a user-centric approach, and will incorporate feedback received from various users and stakeholders throughout the course of its development.

                Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) NITI Aayog and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sunday hosted a three day long Youth Co:Lab -national innovation challenge here in Delhi after a series of successful challenges held in past two phases across the country.

With efforts of AIM and UNDP to support young people by catalysing youth-led innovation, empowering them through Youth Co:Lab, four winning teams made it the list to represent India at the Youth Co:Lab Regional Innovation Challenge in Malaysia slated to be held in April this year.

Youth Co: Lab launched in collaboration by AIM and UNDP earlier, aims at fostering technology, promoting youth leadership and social entrepreneurship in India.

As a part of the first phase of Youth Co: Lab’s national innovation challenge, a series of innovation challenges were held in four cities– Jyothy Foundation (Bengaluru), AIC - Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini Foundation (Mumbai), AIC - Prestige Inspire Foundation (Indore) and AIC - Mahamana Foundation For Innovation and Entrepreneurship - IM-BHU (Varanasi).

The event saw the participation of more than 60 teams from which top 15 winning teams contested in the National Innovation Challenge in Delhi. Another 15 teams had been chosen via the nomination method from the pool of start-ups incubated at the Atal Incubation Centres.

Following this, UNDP and Atal Innovation Mission hosted a three day Youth Co: Lab National Innovation Challenge, 17-19 January 2020 in Delhi in which 30 selected teams participated.

While the first two days focussed on equipping these young change makers with entrepreneurial and 21st century skills to refine their solutions, the final day, saw them present their innovative ideas in front of a jury comprising of key ecosystem enablers.

Sharing his views about the national innovation challenge, Mission Director AIM R Ramanan, said, “We are proud to have partnered with UNDP for this important initiative and are proud to announce that around 300 teams have participated in Youth Co: Lab and over 30 teams in finalists have presented their solutions. Many of them will have the opportunity to avail themselves of world class incubators set up by the AIM as well as the UNDP accelerator program for them to realise their potential and convert their innovation into product that could be used by the millions.”

He added that it will enable young students from all over the country and all over the world to participate in ideation and coming up with innovative solutions to many of the problems faced by the word aligned with the SDGs.

The top two teams will be fully funded, while the next two teams will be partially funded for the final summit. The four teams will also participate in the Regional Springboard Programme. Further, Top eight teams will get incubated at the Atal Incubation Centres and receive support from UNDP to enhance their impact management for a year.

 While speaking on the occasion Ms Shoko Noda, Resident Representative, UNDP India said that ‘‘We at UNDP believe in the power of young people to be change makers in our society. Young people are a central part of the endeavour in achieving the SDGs. Youth Co:Lab is unleashing youth’s creativity, potential and innovation. Through this engagement, we are seeing real impact on their lives, on the issues that matter to them and the future of our planet. 

Co-created in 2017 by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Citi Foundation, Youth Co:Lab aims to establish a common agenda for Asia-Pacific countries to invest in and empower youth to accelerate implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through leadership, social innovation and entrepreneurship. 

By developing 21st century skills, catalysing and sustaining youth-led start-ups and social enterprises across the region, Youth Co:Lab is positioning young people front and centre in order to solve the region’s most pressing challenges. 

With presence in over 20 countries in Asia and the Pacific, Youth Co:Lab was launched in India last year in October, in collaboration with Atal Innovation Mission, NITI Aayog.

In partnership with NITI Aayog, International Energy Agency (IEA) today released the first in-depth review of India’s energy policies.

The report highlights the achievements of India’s energy policies and provides recommendations to support the government’s goals of promoting well-functioning energy markets and boosting deployment of renewables.

Dr Fatih Birol (Executive Director of the IEA) presented the key findings of the review in New Delhi in the presence of Shri Pralhad Joshi (Minister of Coal), Shri Dharmendra Pradhan (Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Steel), Shri R K Singh (Minister for Power and Renewable Energy), Dr Rajiv Kumar (Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog), Shri Amitabh Kant (CEO of NITI Aayog), key energy secretaries, ambassadors and think tanks.

IEA regularly conducts in-depth reviews of energy policies for its member and association countries.This is the first review carried out for India, which has been an IEA-association country since March 2017.

Introducing the report, NITI Aayog Special Secretary Shri RP Gupta welcomed and commended the hard work of the IEA. He said, ‘As India builds on the remarkable growth and development of its energy sector, this in-depth review will help the Government in meeting its energy objectives by setting out a range of recommendations in each energy policy area.’

NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, who had brought up the idea with IEA to conduct the review, said: ‘With clear goals in place, the country is making great strides towards affordable, secure and cleaner energy for all its citizens. India is working hard to move towards its aspirations of transforming the energy sector.’

‘IEA has the privilege of enjoying a close relationship with India. This first in-depth review of the country’s energy policies illustrates the value of our growing collaboration,’ said Dr Birol.

‘The energy choices that India makes will be critical for Indian citizens as well as the future of the planet. This was demonstrated at IEA’s 2019 ministerial meeting, which mandated the Agency to start consultations with India for a strategic partnership that could serve as a path to eventual membership, a game-changer for international energy governance.’

The IEA report congratulates the Indian government on its outstanding achievements in extending citizens’ access to electricity, affordable efficient lighting and clean cooking in record time through historic schemes like SAUBHAGYA, UJALA and UJJWALA,while pursuing energy market reforms and the swift deployment of renewable technologies. The report highlights the strong growth of renewables in India, which now accounts for almost 23% of the country’s total installed capacity. The review also found that energy efficiency improvements in India avoided 15% of additional energy demand, oil and gas imports, and air pollution as well as 300 million tonnes of CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2018.

India is becoming increasingly influential in global energy trends. The country’s demand for energy is set to double by 2040, and its electricity demand may triple, according to the IEA report. Indian oil consumption is expected to grow faster than that of any other major economy. This makes further improving energy security a key priority for India’s economy, says the IEA.

IEA welcomes Indian government policies designed to conduct large-scale renewable energy auctions, open up coal mining to private companies, and promote access to oil and gas markets for foreign investors. The report offers a wide range of recommendations for reforms in support of India’s goal of promoting open and well-functioning energy markets in sectors such as coal, gas and electricity. These include building strong regulators to ensure non-discriminatory access, moving from state allocation to market pricing, and further rationalizing energy subsidies.

In India’s renewables-rich states, the share of variable renewables in electricity generation is already above 15%, a level that calls for dedicated policies to ensure they integrate smoothly into the power system. NITI Aayog can play a strong role in working with the states to implement power sector reforms, advance grid integration, improve flexibility and coordinate energy policy decisions.

The review also strongly encourages India to institutionalise energy policy coordination across government with a national energy policy framework.

Power and Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh congratulated IEA and NITI Aayog for the launch of the report: ‘India’s energy policy is a global story. India has the largest unified power grid that operates in a single frequency. India has moved from scarcity to surplus electricity over the past few years, while implementing the largest and the fastest energy access improvement and energy efficiency programmes in the world.’

Coal Minister Joshi said,‘With the support of Amitabh Kant and Dr Rajiv Kumar, India recently launched commercial mining operations. IEA’s report will be very helpful for designing our future course of action in the energy sector.’

Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Pradhan said:‘NITI Aayog has already started preparing a National Energy Strategy, and I would like to propose an annual event where NITI and IEA can bring together global energy stakeholders to have a structured energy dialogue. We look forward to engaging with IEA on oil security and on helping India move towards a natural gas-based economy.’

NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Dr Kumar emphasised that India’s energy goals cannot be achieved without a strong coordination of policies and targets between Central and state governments, notably on electricity market design and renewable targets, and that a stronger cooperation is therefore needed on these fronts.

The report will help India to design implementation strategies to achieve secure and sustainable energy access for its citizens.

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) today organised a half-day training for nodal officers from eight States to sensitize them on competition assessment, compliance, enforcement and advocacy efforts of the Commission.



Shri Ashok Kumar Gupta, Chairperson, CCI, pin his welcome address underlined the pivotal role of States in taking competition law deeper in the country and in boosting CCI's efforts in making markets across India competition compliant. He highlighted the deterrence effects of the CCI's enforcement in various markets and corrective course undertaken by stakeholders through advocacy initiatives of the CCI. He elaborated upon how the CCI's Resource Person Scheme at the state level aims at sensitizing the state machinery on competition matters, especially public procurement. He encouraged the nodal officers to extend administrative help to Resource Persons to facilitate CCI's advocacy efforts in the states. 

Shri Gupta also stated that enactments and tender conditions may be looked into to ensure that they promote the competition and do not stifle it. 



Shri P.K. Singh, Secretary, CCI, also discussed cases referred to the CCI by S

state governments and encouraged the states to refer more cases to the CCI. Nodal officers interacted with the CCI officials and were briefed about various issues relating to competition law.

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) released a Report titled ‘Market Study on E-commerce in India: Key Findings and Observations’ today, available at: https://www.cci.gov.in/sites/default/files/whats_newdocument/Market-study-on-e-Commerce-in-India.pdf.

The Market Study on E-commerce in India (‘the study’) was initiated by the CCI in April 2019 with a view to better understand the functioning of e-commerce in India and its implications for markets and competition. The objective was also to identify impediments to competition, if any, emerging from e-commerce and to ascertain the Commission’s enforcement and advocacy priorities in light of the same.

The study, a combination of secondary research, questionnaire survey, focused group discussions, one-on-one meetings, a multi-stakeholder workshop and written submissions of stakeholders, covered the three broad categories of e-commerce in consumer goods (mobiles, lifestyle, electrical & electronic appliances and grocery), accommodation services and food services.  16 online platforms, 164 business entities [including sellers (manufacturers and retailers) and service providers (hotels and restaurants)] and 7 payment system providers from across India participated in the study. In addition, 11 industry associations, representing different stakeholder groups, also participated.

The study has helped gather useful insights and information on the key features of e-commerce in India, the different business models of e-commerce players, and the various aspects of commercial arrangements between market participants involved in e-commerce. The study has also provided an opportunity to learn from business enterprises on how they are responding to the advent of digital trade and has helped gauge the key parameters of competition in digital commerce. 

The study confirms that online commerce is gaining importance across the sectors studied. The share of online distribution and its relative importance vis-à-vis traditional channels varies significantly across products. This divergence constrains construction of a unified competition narrative and points to the need for product-specific assessment of market and competition dynamics. Online commerce, as the study shows, has increased price transparency and price competition. The search and compare functionalities of online platforms have lowered search cost for consumers and have provided them with a wide array of alternatives to choose from. For businesses, e-commerce has helped expand market participation by aiding innovative business models.

The report released today presents the key trends identified and also discusses the issues that may, directly or indirectly, have a bearing on competition, or may hinder realisation of the full pro-competitive potential of e-commerce. These include the issues of lack of platform neutrality, unfair platform-to-business contract terms, exclusive contracts between online marketplace platforms and sellers/service providers, platform price parity restrictions and deep discounts. The CCI is of the view that many of these issues would lend themselves to a case-by-case examination by the CCI under the relevant provisions of the Competition Act, 2002. The report outlines these issues and presents the observations of the CCI on the same without assessing whether a conduct is anti-competitive or is justified in a particular context.

On the basis of the market study findings, the enforcement and advocacy priorities for the CCI in the e-commerce sector in India are, inter alia, the following:


	Ensuring competition on the merits to harness efficiencies for consumers
	Increasing transparency to create incentive for competition and to reduce information asymmetry
	Fostering sustainable business relationships between all stakeholders 


The insights gained from the study will inform antitrust enforcement in these markets. Nonetheless, bargaining power imbalance and information asymmetry between e-commerce marketplace platforms and their business users are at the core of many issues that have come up in the market study. Thus, without a formal determination of violation of competition law, improving transparency over certain areas of the platforms’ functioning can reduce information asymmetry and can have a positive influence on competition outcomes. 

In view of the foregoing, the report enumerates certain areas for self-regulation by the e-commerce marketplace platforms. These have been advocated with a view to reduce information asymmetry and promote competition on the merits. The CCI under its advocacy mandate urges the e-commerce platforms to put in place the following transparency measures.

Search ranking


	Set out in the platforms’ terms and conditions a general description of the main search ranking parameters, drafted in plain and intelligible language and keep that description up to date.
	Where the main parameters include the possibility to influence ranking against any direct or indirect remuneration paid by business users, set out a description of those possibilities and of the effects of such remuneration on ranking.
	Introduction of the above-mentioned features, however, should not entail, disclosure of algorithms or any such information that may enable or facilitate manipulation of search results by third parties.  


Collection, use and sharing of data 


	Set out a clear and transparent policy on data that is collected on the platform, the use of such data by the platform and also the potential and actual sharing of such data with third parties or related entities. 


User review and rating mechanism 


	Adequate transparency over user review and rating mechanisms is necessary for ensuring information symmetry, which is a prerequisite for fair competition. Adequate transparency to be maintained in publishing and sharing user reviews and ratings with the business users. Reviews for only verified purchases to be published and mechanisms to be devised to prevent fraudulent reviews/ratings.


Revision in contract terms


	Notify the business users concerned of any proposed changes in terms and conditions. The proposed changes not to be implemented before the expiry of a notice period, which is reasonable and proportionate to the nature and extent of the envisaged changes and to their consequences for the business user concerned.


Discount policy 


	Bring out clear and transparent policies on discounts, including inter alia the basis of discount rates funded by platforms for different products/suppliers and the implications of participation/non-participation in discount schemes.
