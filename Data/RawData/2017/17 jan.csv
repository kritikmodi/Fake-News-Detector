                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated the Bicentenary celebrations of Presidency University today (January 20, 2017) in Kolkata. 
Speaking on the occasion, the  President said the Presidency University is not merely a collection of  buildings or an expression of language. The University stands for  advancement, progress, thinking and questioning. The early students of  the Hindu school from which the College and later the University emerged  were known for their liberal thoughts, ideas, and philosophy as well as  opposition to all prejudice.  
The President said the  Presidency College gave birth to and nurtured generations of students  who went on to influence and change the course of our country’s  history. What is most remarkable is that this institution which was  established primarily to educate the lower bureaucracy of the colonial  rulers, went on to not only question and reform everything archaic, but  also emerged as the hot bed of ant colonial ideas and actions.  
The President said  established as a place for liberal, scientific and secular education  based on western ideas of nationalism, this College became the  institutional as well as intellectual manifestation of Bengali  renaissance. Although Presidency continuously upheld academic  excellence, its most outstanding trait lay in its ability to question,  discuss and debate every established dogma.  Be it socio-religious  beliefs, political construct or ideological tenets, Presidency as an  institution always dwelt upon the thesis and the anti thesis before  arriving at the synthesis, that suited our nation the most. 
The President said as a great  institution of modern world, Presidency’s biggest achievement has been  its ability to inculcate a love for learning. Not just learning that is  contained within the scope of the text books and syllabus, but knowledge  that is acquired by plunging into the depths of subjects.  It is this  eternal pursuit that produced luminaries such as Bankim Chandra  Chatterjee and Anandaram Barooah in literature.  S N Bose, M N Saha, P C  Mahalnobish, Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri, Shyamal Sengupta and Ashoke Sen  in the field of basic Science.  Amartya Sen and Sukhamoy Chakraborty in  the field of economics and alumnus such as Dr Rajendra Prasad (The  President of India), Muhammed Ali of Bogra (Prime Minister of Pakistan)  and Abu Sayeed Chowdhury (The President of Bangladesh). The President  said he was happy that this rich tradition is continuing and expressed  the hope that it will continue to flourish.  
The President said students should not  become mere salesman for commercial products but should contribute to  research, innovation and enhancement of knowledge. He expressed concern over the fact  that none from an Indian University has won the Nobel Prize since Sir CV  Raman and few Indian universities find a place in the top of  international ranking of Universities. He said as Visitor of 126 Central Institutions, he has been  asking institutions of higher learning to focus on research and  innovation as well as improving their international rankings.  He concluded calling upon  Presidency University to become the number one university of the country  and to get a top position in international rankings.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated the Centenary celebrations of Jhalda Satyabhama Vidyapith today (January 18, 2017) at Jhalda, Purulia, West Bengal.
Speaking on the occasion, the President called upon the students to uphold the values of our civilization through the attainment of education. He appreciated the effort by Jhalda Satyabhama Vidyapith to mark its Centenary by setting up a museum on the freedom struggle on the occasion of its centenary. He paid homage to five young men of this area who, inspired by revolutionary patriot, Satya Kinkar Dutta, laid down their lives in the freedom struggle. The President said these martyrs who made the supreme sacrifice for our independence must be saluted. People should be educated about their sacrifice and also, about the Chuar uprising, a glorious chapter in our struggle for freedom whose epicentre was Jhalda.
The President quoted Swami Vivekananda, and said the aim of education is to become a real man. He urged students to have a common goal of attaining education and to uphold the qualities of tolerance, determination and honesty. He said they would hold thereby the flag of our great civilisation high.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to all officers, soldiers, veterans, civilians, ex-servicemen and their families on the occasion of Army Day 2017.
 
In his message, the President has said, “I am happy to learn that the Army Day is being celebrated on 15th January, 2017.
 
The Indian Army plays a pivotal role in ensuring the national security of India, whilst defending our borders across some of the most perilous terrain in the world.  It provides stability during internal security challenges and is often called upon to provide assistance during natural calamities. The Indian Army is known for its professionalism, selfless commitment and the unparalleled bravery of its rank and file.
 
Today, we remember our bravehearts who have made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty.  The nation is indebted to them and their families.  I wish to place on record our deepest appreciation for the dedication and devotion of our soldiers in their service to the nation.
 
I am confident the Indian Army will continue to acquit itself as a robust and vital instrument of national power in the coming years.
 
I wish the Army Day celebrations all success”.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has condoled the passing  away of former Chief Minister of Punjab, Shri Surjit Singh Barnala. 

In a message to his wife, Smt. Surjit Kaur Barnala, the President has  said, “I am sad to learn about the passing away of your husband, Shri  Surjit Singh Barnala, a colleague and friend for long years. 

Shri Barnala was a distinguished Statesman, Parliamentarian and able  administrator who served the nation with great distinction in various  capacities such as Chief Minister of Punjab and Governor of several  states. He also served with distinction as member of the Union Council  of Ministers, having handled portfolios of Agriculture and Chemical and  fertilisers. He will be always remembered for the strong stance he took  against the forces of extremism and the struggle he waged against  terrorists and anti national forces in our country. 

In his passing away, the nation has lost a patriot and a public figure  who made important contribution to the maintaining of the unity and  integrity of our country as well as its comprehensive development. 

Please accept my heartfelt condolences and convey them to all other  members of your family. May God give you and your family the strength  and courage to bear this irreparable loss”.

 The President of India, Shri  Pranab Mukherjee yesterday (January 11, 2017) received His Excellency  Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, the President of the Republic of Kenya at  Rashtrapati Bhavan. He also hosted a banquet in his honour.
Welcoming the President of Kenya, the President said India’s relationship with Kenya is centuries old.  India and Kenya fought together as brothers against colonialism.  The  two countries are bound by common belief in democratic values and  traditions. India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had a special  relationship with Kenyan President’s father, President Jomo Kenyatta who  laid the foundation of the Kenyan nation.  
The President said India and  Kenya have made significant progress in cooperation since  re-establishment of contacts at Head of Government level during the  visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2016.  These high level exchanges are taking place after a gap of over three decades.  He expressed confidence that the Kenyan President’s visit will expand and deepen cooperation between the two countries.  
The President said trade is below potential and there is need for increasing and diversifying economic linkages.  India  welcomes efforts by the industry and business on both sides to pursue  opportunities in healthcare, tourism, IT, agriculture, blue economy and  energy.  
Reciprocating the sentiments  expressed by President Mukherjee, the Kenyan President lauded the role  of the Indian community in Kenya whom he described as part and parcel of  Kenyan society.  He said the Indian community, encouraged by Prime Minister Nehru were an integral part of Kenya’s freedom struggle.  He  called for increased contacts at the highest level so that people and  business leaders get inspired to take relations to a new level.  
Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Pranab Mukherjee said under Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta’s  visionary leadership, Kenya has become one of the fastest growing  economies of Eastern Africa. It has established itself as a hub for  financial, commercial, tourist and transportation services. India  remains committed to its developmental partnership with Kenya. India’s  Technical and Economic Co-operation programme and training and  scholarship initiatives under the India-Africa Forum Summit have  benefited many young Kenyans. India stands ready to assist Kenya further  in its human resource development and capacity building efforts. 
The President said India recently  organized the first-ever Festival of India in Kenya- Urafiki Utsav -  which was well received. We look forward to hosting a Festival of Kenya  in India. In the 21st century, India looks forward to working with Kenya to  fulfill the many shared aspirations of our respective peoples and  contribute to global peace and stability.

Excellency, President Uhuru Kenyatta,
Honourable Ministers from Kenya, 
Distinguished Guests,
Namaskar!
Habari Ya Jioni! 
Mr. President, 
We are delighted to welcome you today. 
Not so long ago, in October last year, I had the  pleasure of welcoming you to the Rashtrapati Bhavan when you  participated in the Third India-Africa Forum Summit hosted in New Delhi.
 
 Your State Visit to India this year, the first State Visit from Kenya since February 1981, reflects a new momentum in our bilateral co-operation. 
 
The initiatives  announced during Honourable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s State  Visit to Kenya last July and your current visit will go a long way in  strengthening our long standing affinities and enhancing our ties in the  diverse areas of our common interest.
 
Excellency,
You have experienced the famed  hospitality of the vibrant State of Gujarat. Of course, the enterprising  people of this ‘Jewel of Western India’ are no strangers to you. Over  the centuries, the Muhindi in Kenya have been a bridge between our two countries - and today, they are as much a part of your society as your own tribes: they are even referred to as the 43rd  tribe of Kenya! Their active involvement in almost every sector of Kenya’s economy bears testimony to their dedication to your great country. 
 
Excellency,
Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, the founding President of Kenya, was an esteemed friend of the leaders of India’s Freedom movement. During his  famous Kapenguria trial in Kenya, independent India’s first Prime  Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, had despatched Diwan Chaman Lal, an  eminent lawyer, to represent and defend him in court.   Over the years,  this mutual regard and understanding have  deepened and evolved into a close relationship. We have made  substantial progress in every sphere of our cooperation. Today,  India  is one of Kenya’s leading trade partners and second largest foreign  investor. The presence of more than forty premier Indian companies in  Kenya bears testimony to the complementarities of our two economies.  India welcomes Kenyan business houses to explore the opportunities that  our flagship schemes offer for partnerships and investments in our  country. 
 
Excellency,
Under your visionary  leadership, Kenya has become one of the fastest growing economies of  Eastern Africa. It has established itself as a hub for financial,  commercial, tourist and transportation services. India remains committed  to her developmental partnership with Kenya. India’s Technical and  Economic Co-operation programme and our training and scholarship  initiatives under the India-Africa Forum Summit have benefited many  young Kenyans. India stands ready to assist Kenya further in her human  resource development and capacity building efforts. 
 
In our discussions  this evening, we shared a sense of satisfaction at our flourishing  people-to-people contacts. This year, Indians represented the third  largest tourist inflow into Kenya. Your beautiful country’s pristine  beaches on the Indian Ocean and famed wild-life parks have always been  major attractions. In turn, Kenyans favour India for business,  education, medical treatment and also tourism. India has recently held  the first-ever Festival of India in Kenya- Urafiki Utsav -  which  was very well received. We look forward to hosting a Festival of Kenya  in India; and we anticipate that before long, Kenyan food like ‘Ugaali’ and ‘Sukuma’ Wiki will be popular in India as well!  
 
It is for these  reasons, Excellency, that India believes that as two old friends, and as  developing nations with a ‘young’ population, there is much that we can  do to build on our synergies. 
In  the 21st century, India looks forward to working with Kenya to fulfill  the many shared aspirations of our respective peoples and contribute to  global peace and stability. I have learned of a Swahili proverb saying - Shikamana kama pete na kidole , meaning, we must hold together like the finger and the ring.  Let this ancient adage inspire our joint efforts. 
 
With these words, Mr. President, I wish you and your distinguished delegation a very fruitful visit to India.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, I request you to join me in raising a toast:-
·      to the health and success of the President of Kenya, His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta;
·      to the progress and prosperity of the people of Kenya, our neighbours across the Indian Ocean; and
·      to the everlasting friendship between India and Kenya.
Thank you !

My dear students:
 
1.             Let me begin by wishing you all a very happy, healthy and prosperous New Year. May this year see the fulfilment of your dreams and aspirations! May this year be full of peace, prosperity and harmony for our beloved country!  
 
Friends: 
2.             After I started addressing you through video conference in January 2014, I have had the occasion to interact with you on this platform six times. Let me thank the teams from National Informatics Centre and the National Knowledge Network for facilitating this interface. In the past, I have spoken on various themes such as democracy and governance, parliament and policy-making, energizing higher educational institutions, youth and nation building, and making innovation a way of life. I have enjoyed speaking to you as much as I have, listening to the teachers and students. For today’s talk, I have chosen the topic, “building a happy society”.
 
3.             You may well ask me why I have chosen to speak to you on this somewhat abstract theme. I was looking at the progress that India has made in the last sixty-five years. In 1951, our population was 360 million. Today, we are a 1.3 billion strong nation. In these six and a half decades, our annual per capita income has gone up from Rs. 7,500 to over Rs. 77,000; GDP growth rate from 2.3 percent to 7.6 percent in 2015-16. The poverty ratio has declined from over 60 per cent to less than 25 percent. The average life expectancy has gone up from 31.4 to 68.4 years. Literacy rate has gone up from 18 to 74 percent. Food grains production has gone up from 45 million to 252 million tonne in 2015-16. From a nation dependent on imports to feed its population, we are a food surplus country and a leading exporter of food commodities.  
 
4.             We are today the fastest growing amongst the major economies of the world. We are the second largest reservoir of scientific and technical manpower, the third military power, the sixth member of the nuclear club, the sixth in the race for space and the tenth industrial power.  
 
5.             In stark contradiction, on the ranking of happiness as reported in the World Happiness Report 2015, we are at the 117thposition out of the 158 countries mapped. This is even more surprising when we look at our civilizational legacy. We are a nation of festivals. Celebration of life is a part of our nature. The concepts of bahujan sukhai bahujan hitai and sarve bhavantu sukhinah have been as old as our civilization. Our prayers are not complete unless we pray for peace, or “shanti” of universe, earth, trees, forests and all others, both living and non-living. Sages taught us time and again that material gain alone cannot fulfil all our needs. Our search for peace, happiness and well-being extends much beyond. 
 
6.             Happiness is fundamental to the human experience of life. Ever since the Prime Minister of Bhutan brought up a resolution in the UN General Assembly in 2011, inviting member nations to measure happiness of their people and to use it to guide public policies, the subject has deeply engaged the minds of policymakers. Today, large numbers of countries are looking at happiness and well-being as the touchstones of public policy.  
These facts set me thinking! Why cannot we make attainment of happiness and well-being as a touchstone for our education system as well? And what better occasion to talk about it than at the beginning of a new year with a bright, educated, energetic and talented audience which I see in front of me?  
 
My young friends: 
7.             Youth today are brimming with hope and aspirations. They pursue their life goals, which they perceive will bring them fame, success and happiness, with single-minded devotion. They consider happiness as their existential objective, which of course is understandable. They search for “affective happiness” in the highs and lows of day-to-day emotions, and “evaluative happiness” in the fulfilment of life objectives they have set for themselves. At the individual level, happiness is a state of mind. At the societal plane, happiness is a complex phenomenon as it is intrinsically linked to the harmony amongst and fulfilment of goals of the society and its members.   
 
8.             Happiness is equally the outcome of non-economic and economic parameters. The quest for happiness is closely tied to the quest for sustainable development, which is the combination of human well-being, social inclusion and environmental sustainability. The focus has to be on eliminating poverty, ensuring environmental sustainability, working towards social inclusion, and providing good governance to achieve the goals of sustainable development. Eradication of poverty would provide a strong boost to happiness. A sustainable environment would prevent irreparable harm to the planetary resources and to future generations. Social inclusion would ensure access to the fruits of progress to all. Good governance implies the ability of people to shape their own lives through transparent and accountable participatory political institutions. 
 
9.             Detailed research has shown that there are some basic attributes of happiness and well-being. Factors that have been found to differentiate the level of happiness in the different regions of the world are: per capita income; healthy years of life expectancy; social support; level of trust; perceived freedom to make life decisions; and generosity. Higher income is no doubt important. But equally important are a better frame of mind and body, and existence of trust in the society. Material wealth can provide comfort but not necessarily happiness.  
 
Friends: 
10.         In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Sage Yajnavalkya tells his wife Maitreyi that whatever we do, we do it for our happiness. And that happiness is derived from the perceived promise of fulfilment of our own incompleteness. If I extend this thought to our day-to-day work life, I can say that when I perform my duty, I do it because it brings me joy; it gives me happiness.  
 
11.         If an educational institution evokes in a student that feeling of being fulfilled, it will create in the student a happy frame of mind where learning will become a joyful experience. Good infrastructure; inspired teachers; closeness to nature will all contribute to promoting a feeling of well-being. Students will look forward to education and desire to become a part of that education eco-system. The institutions of higher learning - its academic leaders, faculty, students and alumni - have to work together to create that eco-system where learning becomes a joyous experience; where education leads to gaining of knowledge and wisdom, and breeds a feeling of happiness. It is our educatinoal institutes, the temples of learning, which must create these waves of happy human beings, who will build a happy India. Only those who are happy can spread happiness. Youth comprises more than 65 percent of India’s total population. If we have happy youth, they can work towards happiness in the society.   
 
12.         The question that now arises is: what is the path to happiness? I present a tool box which you may like to use:  
a)         Happiness is associated with joy and pride, smiling and laughter, good health and enjoyment, creativity and innovation, feeling of safety and other positive actions. You can enhance happiness by learning to wear a smile always; laugh at life; connecting with nature and getting involved with the community. Take interest in sports and nurture a healthy body. Be mindful of what you eat. Distinguish between need and greed. Bringing smiles on the faces of the deprived and the under-privileged can be a truly rewarding experience. Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore had said and I quote: “I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy” (unquote). You can do that. 
b)        Unhappiness is associated with anger, sadness, worry, depression, stress and pain. We see abundance of such negative feelings around us. Incidents of violence against women, road rage, substance abuse, and suicides are all manifestations of this unhappiness. This has to be dealt with by inculcating positive emotions and by displacing negative emotions. Seek help if you need it. Practice yoga and meditation. Every person suffers from negative feelings associated with unhappiness some time or the other in their lives. The success lies in decreasing the occurrence of such feelings by increasing the strength of positive feelings associated with happiness. You can leave behind a bad experience quickly by pro-social behaviour, including empathy and altruism. Look inwards for happiness.  
c)         Make books your best friends. Develop a love for books and inculcate the habit of reading. Develop an interest for art and culture. Become a keen observer of your surroundings and environment. Develop a habit of life-long learning. Think through the problems and their solutions. Remember that our happiness is not divisible. If we care for ‘others’, then we also share our knowledge and other resources with them. Happiness then becomes an inevitable derivative of a humane pursuit.
 
13.         I invite you to use this toolbox. I wish you Godspeed in achieving a state of true happiness.
 
Thank you. 
      Jai Hind.

It is indeed a pleasure for me to be  present amongst you on the occasion of the valedictory session of the  Pravasi Bhartiya Sammelan.  On this historic day 102 years ago, the  greatest Pravasi Bhartiya of all times Mahatma Gandhi returned to India  from South Africa. 
2.        We gather here today to recalibrate and reaffirm our roots even as we  take pride in and gain sustenance from our adopted countries.  One of  the largest community of expatriates amounting to about 31.7 millions,  the Pravasi Bhartiya stands out for his innate ability to assimilate and  yet maintain his identity.  In doing so, you have contributed immensely  to your adopted lands through your dedication and hard work.
3.        There are many amongst you who have made notable contributions in the  fields of high technology, business, politics, art & culture and  sports to mention, a few.  On behalf of the Government of India, it was  indeed an honour for me to have conferred the Pravasi Bhartiya Samman on  30 members of the Diaspora just a while back.  I congratulate each one  of you for your contributions to your counties of origin and India.
4.        Friends, We are here today to celebrate your successes and  achievements.  You have been the frontline envoys of Indian culture  since long and I hope that you will remain the foremost emissaries of  the unfolding Indian story. As a people exposed to the best of western  technology and yet having their civilisational moorings in the ageless  and eternal ethos of India, you are doubly blessed.  The synergy of the  west and the east that you represent, provides you with a unique  position and opportunity that involves sharing knowledge between your  home land and your adopted countries.  While you showcase India to your  host countries, you also bring along the cultural heritage of your  adopted lands to India.  To my mind, nothing could exemplify our belief  of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbkam’ more than this.  
5.        Many of you having achieved material abundance, are actively involved  in the pursuit of higher callings of spiritualism and happiness.  For us  in India, this has to be a parallel exercise and I am sure that you  could play a guiding role in this sphere.  As we continue to strive  successfully in achieving our due and deserving place amongst the Comity  of Nations on economic and strategic indices, our ancient strengths in  the realm of the sublime and the subtle should continue to remain in  focus. 
5.       Dear Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen,
           The Pravasi Bhartiya Divas has been a flagship event for the engagement  of the government with the Diaspora spread across the world.  I am  happy to know that Indian Embassies and High Commissions abroad are  celebrating the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas today, with the members of  Indian Diaspora in their respective countries. 
6.       This Convention does not only provide an interface between  the government and the Indian Diaspora. It also provides an excellent  opportunity for both the Government of India and the State Governments  to showcase policies, initiatives and achievements in various sectors  and invite the Diaspora to contribute and give back to the country of  their origin.
7.       Friends, we have  amongst us several eminent personalities from the Indian Diaspora who  are in leadership positions across the Globe. His Excellency Dr Antonio  Costa, the Prime Minister of Portugal who is with us today, has his  roots in Goa. His presence here is a source of inspiration for us, and  for the Indian Diaspora across the world. We are delighted that he could  participate as Chief Guest in the Pravasi Bharatiya Sammelan. India's  relations with Portugal have been and continue to stay warm and friendly  with close political, security, cultural and most importantly  people-to-people ties.
8.       I am also glad  that one of the youngest Indian Diaspora leaders, the Vice President of  Suriname Mr. Michael Ashwin Adhin is here with us today.  India enjoys  close and friendly relations with Suriname, reinforced by cultural and  people to people contact. The Indian Diaspora migrated to Suriname  nearly 142 years ago. More than 2,30,000 persons of Indian-origin living  in Suriname have made a significant contribution in all walks of life  in that country.
9.       Distinguished  Friends, while we celebrate achievements and successes, I want to draw  attention towards several NRI’s who are temporary migrants in the Gulf  region and South East Asia.  They are Indian citizens who migrate for  employment as low-skilled and semi-skilled labour. They toil hard day  and night, and save to send the fruits of their labour as remittances to  India, to maintain their families back home. These remittances are the  largest by any Diaspora, at 12% of the total global remittances,  amounting to $69 billion in 2015. 
10.     Many of them are  likely to return to India, but while they live abroad, all of them are  vulnerable in many ways owing to the fact that they do not enjoy the  privileges of citizenship in their host country.  This is especially  true of people working in areas of strife and conflict, with their  security and physical well being on the line.  In this regard, it is  with satisfaction that I note the role played by their mother country in  assuaging their concerns.  In swift and coordinated operations  involving multiple Ministries and Organizations, we have been able to  bring back thousands of fellow countrymen from strife torn Nations. I  congratulate our dynamic External Affairs Minister Sushma Swarajji and  MOS VK Singh for the initiatives of the Ministry of External Affairs in  this regard.
11.     With regards to  these temporary migrants going abroad in search of employments, it will  also be prudent that attention is paid towards their skill  up-gradation.  Establishing linkages between the Government of India’s  skilling programmes and the skill gap that exists amongst the migrant  workforce will go a long way in enhancing their employability as well as  earnings. 
12.     Friends, Over the  past couple of years, we have introduced several initiatives aimed at  smart solutions. In 2014, we launched the e-Migrate platform for  efficiency and transparency in the recruitment of ""Emigration Check  Required"" (ECR) category of Indian workers. Such initiatives will surely  help in protecting the rights of our workers proceeding abroad and  ensure accountability of recruitment agents in India and their foreign  employers.
13.      As far as the vulnerabilities of expat Indians are concerned, I would  also like to flag the concerns of women & girls in India marrying  into NRI families.  Even as the government and its agencies deal with  this issue, the concerns of this particular section can be most  effectively addressed by the local Community Organisations. I take this  opportunity to call upon the Indian Community Organisations abroad –  many of whom have been awarded today, to continue complimenting the  government’s efforts by working in tandem. 
14.     Distinguished  Guests, occasions such as this provide us with an opportunity to  reaffirm our continued engagement with each other.  At the same time,  they also call for reorientation and rejuvenation in our areas of  engagement.  The government is implementing certain schemes for the  youth who were born and brought up abroad.  In this regard “The Know  India Programme” is a flagship initiative under which such youth can  visit India to rediscover their heritage and culture and get acquainted  with contemporary India.
15.     Similarly, the  occasion calls for highlighting sectors in India that need your active  support and engagement.  We have a young population which needs to be  equipped with the professional and technical education of the highest  standards.  The Indian Diaspora may consider participation in programmes  such as GIAN - Global Initiative of Academic Networks, under which they  can visit India for short term academic assignments with institutions  of higher learning, including IITs and IIMs.  They can also avail the  fellowships and scholarship programmes offered by the Department of  Science & Technology and Biotechnology, to explore avenues for joint  research and development.   Through such collaborations, our  Institutions, Entrepreneurs and Innovators can enrich our education  sector and skilling efforts.
16.     Similarly for you,  the opportunities for contributing to your motherland and being a part  of its exciting growth story, are many and varied.  Be it “Make in  India”, “Start up India”, “Digital India” or “Swachh India”; all these  programs provide ample opportunities for you to participate, contribute  and benefit.
17.     Friends, I am  confident that your attachment with your place of origin and your  connect with the nation have been strengthened, through your  participation in the Pravasi Bharatiya Convention.  I once again exhort  all of you present here, to become a part of the evolving Indian story,  which is a wonderful story of 1.3 billion people of great diversity with  underlying unity living under one system, one constitution and one  flag.
 
18.       I  was also particularly happy to release the book of speeches by the  Prime Minister on foreign policy today. His speeches tell the story of  the emerging India, an India which is moving ahead, leaving behind the  baggage of history and looking at the world with optimism.


19.       In the end, I conclude by again congratulating all the  recipients of the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman.  I also wish you all a  happy, prosperous and enriching year ahead.
      Thank You.
Jai Hind!

         Speaking on the occasion, the President expressed hope  that the Indian Diaspora spread across the world will remain foremost  emissaries of the unfolding Indian story. He said as people exposed to  the best of western technology and yet having their civilisational  moorings in the ageless and eternal ethos of India, they are doubly  blessed.  The synergy of the west and the east that they represent,  provides them with a unique position and opportunity that involves  sharing knowledge between their home land and their adopted countries.   While they showcase India to their host countries, they also bring along  the cultural heritage of their adopted lands to India.  To his mind,  nothing could exemplify our belief of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbkam’ more than this.  
The  President said as we continue to strive successfully in achieving our  due and deserving place amongst the comity of nations, our ancient  strengths in the realm of the sublime and the subtle should continue to  remain in focus.  Attention should be paid to the need for skill  up-gradation of temporary migrants going abroad in search of  employment.  Establishing linkages between the Government of India’s  skilling programmes and the skill gap that exists amongst the migrant  workforce will go a long way in enhancing their employability as well as  earnings. 
The  President also flagged the concerns of women and girls in India  marrying into NRI families.  He said even as the government and its  agencies deal with this issue, the concerns of this particular section  can be most effectively addressed by the local Community Organisations.  He called upon Indian Community Organisations abroad to continue to  compliment the government’s efforts in the above regard. 
 
The President  released a compilation of Selected Speeches by the Prime Minister  Narendra Modi on foreign policy on the occasion.

His Excellency Mr. Antonio  Costa, the Prime Minister of the Portuguese Republic called on President  of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (January 7,  2017).
 
Welcoming the Portuguese Prime  Minister to India, the President said India attaches great value to its  historical bonds with Portugal spanning over 500 years.  India and Portugal share core values of democracy, pluralism, multiculturalism and rule of law.  The two countries built on many commonalities and have developed a broad programme of mutually beneficial co-operation.  
 
The President said Prime  Minister Antonio’s visit takes place at a time when relations between  India and Portugal are in an excellent state. In trade and investment,  scientific research, education, culture and security, our success is  substantial.  There is much promise and potential for building on our friendship and strengthening our 21st century partnership.  Both  the countries seek to strengthen their collaboration in areas where  they have synergies including defence, maritime cooperation and  oceanography and partnerships in third countries.  Trade  and investment ties between India and Portugal have much scope for  improvement. Bilateral trade is of the order of USD 700 million.  It  needs to be energised and the trade basket diversified. The President  also praised the 70,000 strong Indian Diaspora in Portugal for playing  an important role in strengthening India-Portugal relations.
 
The Portuguese Prime Minister  reciprocated the President’s sentiments and said he was honoured to pay a  state visit to India as the first Portuguese Prime Minister of Indian  origin.  He said the two countries share history and common values.  There is need to strengthen and modernize the United Nations.  Therefore, Portugal supports the inclusion of countries like India in the UN Security Council.  Only a strong UN can deal with challenges like terrorism, climate change etc.  He said there is need to do much more than has been done in the past as far as bilateral relations concerned.  Portugal is keen to strengthen relations with India.

In a message to his son, Shri Ishaan Puri, the President has said, “I am sad to learn about the passing away of your father, Shri Om Puri.  
          A veteran and iconic actor, Shri Om Puri delighted fans  all over the world with his masterful screen presence and performance.  For his contribution to Indian Cinema, he was honoured with numerous  awards including the prestigious ‘Padma Shri’ in the year 1990. In the  passing away of Shri Om Puri, the Indian film industry has lost a highly  talented and acclaimed actor who played memorable roles in numerous  movies.  He shall always be  remembered for his powerful and versatile acting, which brought life  into the celluloid characters he played in films.  His sad demise has left a huge void in the field of Indian film industry, which will be difficult to fill.  
          Please  accept my heartfelt condolences and convey them to all members of your  family. I pray to the Almighty to give your family and you the strength  and courage to bear this irreparable loss”.

It is indeed a pleasant  occasion for me to be present at the Prabasi Odia Conclave, 2017  organized by the Odisha Forum and the Government of Odisha. It is a  commendable initiative, admirable in its scope and professed objectives.
2.      Friends,  Right from the epic Battle of Kalinga that turned a raging violent  monarch to Ashoka - the Great missionary, Odisha has many firsts to its  credit. It stands out as the first State to have been created on the  basis of language in 1936, eleven years before independence. It was the  first State of the Union to embrace the process of integration of  Princely States into the Indian Union and voluntary democratization of  erstwhile Princely States.
3.      In this regard, it is worthwhile to quote Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,  who wrote,""... I had the privilege of initiating the twin process of  integration (of princely states) and democratization, which for its  small beginnings in distant Orissa, has gradually swept over the whole  of the subcontinent.”
While on the topic of India’s democratization,  I would be remiss to not talk about the leaders of Odisha during the  freedom struggle. They played key roles in the freedom struggle as well  as in making a deep impact on Mahatma Gandhi who was moved by their  selfless service and sacrifice for the cause of Odisha and India. 
4.      These  virtues are best exemplified in the contributions of Utkalmani  Gopabandhu Das who has been rightly described as a compassionate rebel,  surviving only on Rice and Dal. In 1921 during his first visit to  Odisha, Gandhiji seeing him surviving as such, asked him if such poor  diet would not adversely affect his health? Gopabandhu replied that he  was willing to suffer such privation for the sake of Swaraj. Gandhiji in  his article 'My Odisha Tour’ praised the conviction and wrote that he  would surely make India free if he could gather hundred Gopabandhus in India.
5.      Indeed  the ethos of Swaraj in all its glory has been guiding this pearl of  east which has contributed in many ways to building India.  
6.      The  people of the State have a glorious legacy inspiring the rest of the  country. While reflecting on prabasi Odias my mind goes back to deep  recesses of history of the State. The earliest examples of prabasi Odias represent  fine examples of entrepreneurship and business acumen which are now  needed and indeed applied, across India to register higher growth and  development. 
7.      Speaking  of Prabasi Odias, I am reminded of the legendary Utkal Gaurab  Madhusudan Das, who spent considerable part of his life outside Odisha  spearheading a movement to start the first ever step in the form of  historic Utkal Aammilani in 1903 to unify Odisha as a separate state. It  was also he who established the first educational institution for women  which became a college in 1913 much ahead of the first women's  university in Bombay set up in 1916, a loft endeavour at the time and a  worthy endeavour for all times.
8.      It was with his efforts that women law graduates could enter   the  legal profession as a practicing member of the Bar in India. Till 1923  the Legal Practitioner Act did not mandate women law graduates to pursue  law practice. Madhusudhan Das filed a writ petition in Privy Council in  London and pleaded that in public interest women law graduates should  be permitted to become lawyers. This is perhaps the first example of  public interest litigation. Eventually in 1923 the Legal Practitioner  Act was amended permitting women law graduates to become lawyers. 
9.      Such  insights throw light on the remarkable contributions of Odia leaders  who contributed considerably for the cause of Odisha and India. 
10.    Today,  in India as indeed the world over, Odias are excelling, they have  registered their presence in every nook and corner of India on the  strength of their merit and worth and have attained excellence based on  their higher educational attainments. We have today a large pool of  prabasi Odias who are well known for their excellence in diverse fields  of politics, judiciary, journalism, bureaucracy and litrature.
11.    The  rich cultural heritage of the State is best reflected in myriad forms  of dance, music and performing arts. Odisha has a long and rich history  of excelling in art, culture, music, dance and architecture. In recent  times, many Odia poets and litterateur have won the Sahitya Academy,  Gyanpitha and other national awards. It is befitting that Odia has now  been recognized as a classical language. 
12.    I  am therefore glad to note that you are devoting a session to ""Odisha,  the Soft Power” which will showcase Odisha’s strength in this field.
I am sure that the large gathering of Odias from  different parts of India and world would bring together the diverse  talent pool of the State and harness their capabilities and expertise  for growth, development and onward progress of Odisha and India. I am  sure that this Prabasi Odia conclave will take forward such a vision. 
13.    People  of Odisha' who are outside the State and India, as well as the  residents of the State will have to take immediate as well as far  reaching steps, with the Government playing the role of a proactive  catalyst. 
14.    At  a time when world has been integrated in lightning speed we need to  take advantage of such integration and bring together talents within  Odisha and outside to provide synergy for our onward development and  progress. 
15.    In  this regard, I feel that this conclave is a historic step for not only  Odisha but for whole of India. The illustrious C. F. Andrews, a close  associate of Ravindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi wrote an  illuminating article entitled Spirit of Odisha in 1927. In the very  first para of that article, he observed that if love is the first act of  service then it is easy to serve Odisha for he never saw such loveable  people in rest of India. 
 
16.    With  these words I have great pleasure in associating myself with the  loveable people of Odisha and prabasi Odias on the occasion of the  organization of Prabasi Odia Conclave 2017. I greet all of you on this  occasion and wish the conclave all the Success.

My dear Governors and Lt. Governors:
1.                  Let me begin by extending warm greetings and best wishes to you for a year full of peace, prosperity and happiness.
 
2.                  The year that has just gone by was a year of mixed fortunes. It began on a very promising note with the economy performing well, overcoming the weak global economic trends. GDP growth of 7.2 percent in the first half of 2016-17 – same as that of last year – is a pointer to the fact that our economic recovery has been on solid grounds. In 2014 and 2015, below normal rains had caused rural distress. A good monsoon in 2016 is expected to improve agricultural production and increase rural employment and incomes. Though our exports have been affected by weak global demand, we have a stable external sector. Reviving exports will remain a challenge but we can overcome it by improving the competitiveness of the domestic industry. 
 
3.                  Demonetization, while immobilizing black money and fighting corruption, may lead to temporary slowdown of the economy. We all will have to be extra careful to alleviate the suffering of the poor which might become unavoidable for the expected progress in the long term. While I appreciate the thrust on transition from entitlement approach to an entrepreneurial one for poverty alleviation, I am not too sure that the poor can wait that long. They need to get succour here and now, so that they can also participate actively in the national march towards a future devoid of hunger, unemployment and exploitation. The recent package announced by the Prime Minister will provide some relief.
 
Hon’ble Governors and Lt. Governors:
4.                  This year, there will be elections in as many as seven states. The dates for elections in five states have already been announced. The conduct of free and fair elections has made our democracy one of the most vibrant in the world. Elections reflect the attitudes, values and beliefs of the people towards their political environment. They symbolize the sovereignty of the people and provide legitimacy to the authority of the government. They also serve the purpose of regulation of public policies and mobilization of public opinion. 
 
5.                  As we have all experienced, elections are usually marked by competitive populism, electoral rhetoric and vote bank politics. Noisy debates can deepen the fault-lines in the society. You, as Governors and Lt. Governors, command respect and attention of the people of your state. Through your interaction and wise counsel, you can play an important role in easing the tensions in the society. Goodwill must prevail between different communities. At times, harmony may be put to test by vested interests. Communal tensions may rear their ugly head. Rule of law must form the sole basis of dealing with any such challenging situation. 
 
Governors and Lt. Governors:
6.                  In a pluralistic democracy like ours, tolerance, respect for contrary views and patience are a must. These values have to be preserved. India is a multi-faceted nation of 1.3 billion people, 122 languages, 1600 dialects and 7 religions. In the words of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru which I quote: ""It is a country held together by strong but invisible threads” (unquote). India’s strength lies in her diversity. The multiplicity in culture, faith and language is what makes India special. There will always be divergent strands in public discourse. We may argue. We may disagree. But we cannot deny the prevalence of multiplicity of opinion. You can, through your calm influence, inculcate amongst the citizens of your state this fundamental ethos of our civilization.
 
Hon’ble Governors and Lt. Governors:
7.                  You are the first citizens of your states. When you assumed this exalted office, you had taken an oath to protect, preserve and defend the Constitution. This pious document protects the liberty of the people and promotes the well-being of the citizens. It decrees inclusiveness, tolerance, self-restraint, and protection of women, senior citizens and weaker sections as essential ingredients of our polity. Our institutions of democracy must operate on these vital features. Strong credible institutions lead to good governance ensuring a healthy functioning of the democracy.
 
Dear Governors and Lt. Governors:
8.                  You all have a very important role to play in the improvement of higher education in your states. As chancellors and visitors of various universities, you can work with the academic leaders to effect holistic changes for quality up-gradation in the institutions of higher learning. I have been exhorting the academia to concentrate on attaining excellence through original research and technology development. A look at numerous social problems affecting millions of women and men in our farms and factories clearly shows that humane values have not yet become a dominant driver of our intellectual pursuits. This should receive your focused attention. Our interactions at the conferences at Rashtrapati Bhavan have yielded several positives in areas like: faculty sourcing and development; ICT for pedagogic refinement; research and innovation; industry-academia interface; and alumni involvement. I am aware of the good work being done by many of you in this field. Interaction amongst academic institutions can help spread best practices. These institutions can leverage knowledge and experience to the benefit of all. Your keen interest can rejuvenate a sector that is best positioned to support an innovation-led knowledge economy.
 
9.                  Another area where I envisage a role for you is in promoting art and culture in your respective states. As I have said elsewhere, art and culture are our link with the past. They provide the foundation for our current thought and by extension, the platform for our future action. They also provide a stable base to life and make it possible for us to have a joyous existence. With art and culture, we can experience life in its fullest and most meaningful form. They add to the overall happiness and well-being of the society.
 
Hon’ble Governors and Lt. Governors:
10.              Before I conclude, I express my deep appreciation to you all for coming together on this platform for our interaction. Within the limited time available, let us share some of our key concerns. I do look forward to our extended interface in the Governor’s Conference, when we will have the time to hear each one of us in detail.
 
Thank you.
Jai Hind.

A  group of probationers of Indian Defence Accounts Service (2015 batch)  called on the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee today (January  2, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 
 
Speaking  on the occasion, the President congratulated the Indian Defence  Accounts Service Officers for having succeeded in the civil services  exam, one of the toughest examinations in the country. He said that  established 267 years ago, the Defence Account department back then, was  known as the military accounts department. This department remained under the  administrative control of the Ministry of Finance till 1983. On the  introduction of the integrated financial advice scheme, it came under  the control of the Defence Ministry.
 
The  President said that the Indian armed forces have a huge responsibility  to defend the nation. To achieve this objective, our armed forces should  modernize. He said that the responsibility of the Defence Account cadre  has always been onerous. In the scenario of ever increasing defence  outlay, their responsibilities are only bound to increase. Their focus  should not be only on the financial aspects but also on the overall  defence scenario. Their role while rendering financial advice should be  to facilitate the process. As watch dogs they need to be careful in  discharging their duty of scrutinizing financial expenditure.

The Vice  President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that the media must  stand up to fear, seek information and speak out. It must not hesitate  to tell the powers their errors in commission and omission and a  fundamental function of the media and a basic requirement for the  functioning of a healthy democracy. He was addressing the gathering  after giving away the C.H. Mohammed Koya National Journalism Awards  2016, here today. The former Minister for Defence, Shri A.K. Anthony and  other dignitaries were present on the occasion.
 
 
The Vice President said that Journalism as a professional calling is more than a mere job, it is a public good. A  healthy, vibrant democracy not only creates the space for a free media,  but rather it needs an impartial and independent media for its  survival, he added. 
 
The Vice  President said that a responsible press is needed to hold power to  account and that is why our founding fathers enshrined the freedom of  press in the Constitution under the rubric of Article 19 (1)(A), subject  only to reasonable restrictions. The media has an important  responsibility, particularly in a democratic polity, to tell the truth  to the powers that be, even if the powers that be have a habit of not  liking this, he added.
 
Following is the text of Vice President’s address:
 
“It has been a pleasure to  give away the C.H. Mohammed Koya National Journalism Awards. The awards,  instituted in the memory of C H Mohammed Koya, former Chief Minister of  Kerala, are a fitting tribute to his memory. He believed in using the  media to bring about social awareness and change and his role in  advancing the educational infrastructure in Kerala as education Minister  is well known. The efforts of the C H Mohammed Koya Trust and the  Calicut Press Club in instituting and maintaining these awards, that  recognize outstanding contribution to journalism, are laudable. I  congratulate all the awardees for their hard-work and dedication to the  highest traditions of journalism. 
In this era of  ‘post-truths’, where ‘advertorials’ and ‘response features’ edge-out  editorials, we would do well to recall one of the greatest journalists  that India has ever produced, and look at the ethos and principles that  powered his journalism.
I am referring, of course, to Mahatma Gandhi. 
Gandhiji was associated  with six journals, and for two very influential weeklies, he was the  editor. He published no advertisement; at the same time he did not want  his newspapers to run at a loss. He had gained considerable experience  in South Africa, where he had taken over the editorial role of the  'Indian Opinion' in 1904 and published it in English, Tamil and  Gujarati, sometimes running the press himself. Later, 'Young India' and  'Harijan' became powerful vehicles of his views on all subjects. He  wrote on all subjects. He wrote simply and clearly but forcefully.  For Gandhiji, the three objectives of the press were;

    One, to understand the popular feeling      and give expression to it; 
    Two, to arouse among the people certain      desirable sentiments, and 
    Third, to fearlessly expose popular      defects.

On the profession of journalism, Gandhiji wrote;
“In  my humble opinion, it is wrong to use a newspaper as a means of earning  a living. There are certain spheres of work which are of such  consequence and have such bearing on public welfare that to undertake  them for earning one's livelihood will defeat the primary aim behind  them. When, further a newspaper is treated as a means of making profits,  the result is likely to be serious malpractices. It is not necessary to  prove to those who have some experience of journalism that such  malpractices do prevail on a large scale.”
How many of our journals and newspapers today would pass Gandhiji’s test?
John Rawls, in his seminal book, ‘A Theory of Justice’,  maintained that substantially equal access to the media was an  essential requirement to prevent politics being captured by  concentrations of private economic power, which would make it impossible  for equally-able citizens to have equal opportunities to influence  politics regardless of their class. In an article investigating the  charge of editorial bias, A. S. Panneerselvan, drawing on Rawls, wrote  last year that journalism has to ensure that its twin functions – the  credible-informational and the critical-investigative-adversarial or “what is in public interest and what the public is interested in — be carried out in a manner where “issues of public interest are not subsumed by the dictates of what the public is interested in.” 
Journalism as a  professional calling is more than a mere job, it is a public good. The  fourth estate has an important role to play in a democracy. A healthy,  vibrant democracy not only creates the space for a free media, but  rather it needs an impartial and independent media for its survival. The  essential roles that a free and responsible media is expected to play  in a democratic society include;

    Inform the people of  democratic choices      through the clarification of complex issues,  particularly in an age when      information is the driving force of  economic advancement and international      events impact on people's  daily lives as never before; 
    Provoke public debates leading to greater      public participation in decision making; 
    Uncover abuses of power for their      rectification; 
    Alert and mobilize public opinion to      instances of injustices; 
    Allow space for political pluralism by      carrying different views and opinions, and; 
    Keep leaders attuned  to public opinion      while offering them a medium to explain their  policies and decisions to      public opinion.

We need a responsible  press to hold power to account. That is why our founding fathers  enshrined the freedom of press in the Constitution under the rubric of  Article 19 (1)(A), subject only to reasonable restrictions in the  interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the  state, public order, decency, contempt of court, defamation and  incitement to an offence. Repeated Judicial pronouncements have upheld  this freedom, underscoring that ‘freedom of speech and of the press is the Ark of the Covenant of Democracy’  because public criticism is essential to the working of its  institutions. Recently, the Supreme Court, terming liberty of thought  and expression as ‘cardinal’,  struck down the controversial Article 66 (A) of the IT Act as being  unconstitutional for being violative of Article 19(1)(A), not saved by  Article 19(2).
The media, with its  protections and rights, enjoys tremendous freedom. The media also has a  transmutative power. It not only portrays reality but can alter the  perception of reality itself. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said on the eve of  our independence, ‘Freedom and power bring responsibility’. The media has an  important responsibility, particularly in a democratic polity, to tell  the truth to the powers that be, even if the powers that be have a habit  of not liking this. 
In a letter addressed to George Washington in 1792, Thomas Jefferson said,
“No  government ought to be without censors, and where the press is free, no  one ever will. If virtuous, it need not fear the fair operation of  attack and defence. Nature has given to man no other means of sifting  out the truth whether in religion, law or politics. I think it as  honourable to the government neither to know nor notice its sycophants  or censors, as it would be undignified and criminal to pamper the former  and persecute the latter.”
With what degree of certainty can we say that our press has upheld its social responsibilities?
In its 2016 assessment of  press freedom in India, the Freedom House, Freedom of Press report,  categorized India as ‘partially free’, with an overall score of 41 (out  of 100). The Press status report by the organization Reporters sans Frontiers was even more critical, ranking India 133 out of 180 countries in terms of press vitality and freedom.
The capitulation of our  press, when confronted with the abuse of power in our country was  tellingly put in perspective by a senior political personality, when he  said that the press, ‘when asked to bend, crawled’. He was, of course, referring  to the manner in which our media, barring a few notable examples,  conducted itself during period when emergency was imposed. Perhaps more  damning were his comments in an interview in 2015 that ‘parts of the media still bend, often without being asked’.  Coming on the heels of his caution that the ‘forces that can crush democracy are stronger’, it calls for serious introspection by our media.
In a recent article underlining the need for a free media, Irina Bokova, the Director General of UNESCO said that the ‘Freedom  of expression, press freedom and freedom of information are ends in  themselves — the free flow of ideas and opinions, as well as debate and  critical examination, creates a wealth of ideas and drives innovation  and positive change’. Freedom of media is vital for accountability  and transparency. It is a pillar of democracy, the rule of law and good  governance and contributes to more inclusive and sustainable  development, and, in empowering citizens of our country.
Today, more than ever, the  media must stand up to fear, seek information and speak out. It must  not hesitate to tell the powers their errors in commission and omission.  It is a fundamental function of the media and a basic requirement for  the functioning of a healthy democracy. Today’s award winners prove that  this can be done.
Jai Hind.”

                Shri M. Hamid Ansari, the Vice President of India has called for a  balanced approach between the creation of clinical health infrastructure  and the demands of public health when evaluating the overall needs of  the country’s health requirements. He was speaking at the 4th  Convocation Ceremony of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New  Delhi here today. Shri Anil Baijal, Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Shri  Manish Sisodia, Deputy Chief Minister, Delhi, Shri Satyendar Jain,  Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Government of Delhi, Dr. M.M.  Kutty, Chief Secretary, Government of Delhi and Shri Chandrakar Bharti,  Secretary, Health & Family Welfare, Government of Delhi, were also  present on the occasion.  

The Vice President said that although India is experiencing a rapid  health transition, the country’s disease burden remains extraordinarily  high. We are confronted both by an unfinished agenda of infectious  diseases, nutritional deficiencies and unsafe pregnancies as well as the  challenge of escalating epidemics of non-communicable diseases, he  added. 

Underlining the need for a comprehensive Act that covers the various  aspects of healthcare rights, delivery and related matters, the Vice  President said that excessive focus on curative medical care detracts  attention from the much more cost-effective and efficient option of  preventive public health investments that can stem the spread of  infectious diseases and improve nutritional outcomes in the country.  

Pointing out that our public expenditure on health, particularly public  health continues to be low, the Vice President called for an increase in  financial commitment, both by the Centre and the States, towards public  health concerns in order to make the 1978 Alma Ata declaration of  “Health for All” a reality. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address on the occasion:  

“I am happy to be here at the Institute for Liver and Biliary Sciences  set up by the Government of Delhi as an autonomous, super-specialty,  medical and research institute with the objective of providing a high  class facility for diagnosis and treatment in the field of Liver and  Biliary Diseases, including a Centre for Advance Dedicated Research.  

Convocations are occasions to honour intellectual achievement and  celebrate life in the academic world. They mark the graduation of  students from a temple of learning to the realities and challenges of  life outside it. It is nevertheless important to remember that pursuit  of knowledge is a lifelong process and does not end with the acquisition  of a degree. 

In recent years healthcare in India has been in public focus with  particular emphasis on referral hospitals. In 2014, the government  announced that it would set up 10 more institutions like the All India  Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) across the country. Similar  announcements are also made by state governments. 

When evaluating the overall needs of the country’s health requirements, a  balanced approach between the creation of clinical health  infrastructure and the demands of public health have to be considered.  Following points may be of interest to this audience; 

•	An internal study of the AIIMS trauma centre in New Delhi found that  failure to provide nutrition and hospice facilities led to the death of  nearly 50% of patients with head injuries discharged from the hospital.   

•	There is a growing body of research that shows how eradicating open  defecation and improving sanitation can improve health outcomes greatly,  especially among children. Not only does improved sanitation bring  immediate returns in terms of reduced incidence of illnesses such as  diarrhoea, it also leads to long-term gains such as reduced stunting and  better cognitive abilities among children. 

•	It has been estimated that costs due to poor sanitation facilities  were to the tune of more than 6% of India’s gross domestic product in  2006. 

•	The western approach of avoiding diseases, death and disability,  traditionally focused on personal hygiene and public sanitation during  the 19th Century. This approach, combined with better food availability,  paid rich dividend in the developed countries in reducing morbidity and  mortality.  

•	A joint Stanford Medical School and Harvard University study shows  that the provision of safe water and better sewage facilities reduced  infant mortality significantly in the greater Boston area between 1880  and 1915. It underlines the importance of providing proper sewage  facilities in a rapidly urbanizing Third World. 

•	Absence of universal health coverage and limited social health  coverage has led to a high burden of Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) expenditure in  India. OOP contributes approximately 86% of private expenditure and 60%  of overall healthcare expenditure in our country. 

I highlight these points to illustrate that although India is  experiencing a rapid health transition, the country’s disease burden  remains extraordinarily high. We are confronted both by an unfinished  agenda of infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies and unsafe  pregnancies as well as the challenge of escalating epidemics of  non-communicable diseases. This composite threat to the nation’s health  and development needs a concerted public health response that can ensure  efficient delivery of cost-effective interventions for health  promotion, disease prevention and affordable diagnostic and therapeutic  healthcare. 

Public health has been defined as the science dealing with the  determinants and defence of health at the population level, while  clinical medicine deals with multiple maladies and their remedies at the  level of an individual patient. Public health takes into account the  social, cultural and economic determinants of health to create systems  for efficient health services delivery. It is focused on research,  teaching and professional practice to prevent disease and promote health  in populations. 

The approach to developing a holistic public health policy has to be  inter-disciplinary and multi-sectoral, encompassing elements from areas  like epidemiology, biostatistics, behavioral sciences, health economics,  health services management, environmental health, health inequities,  human rights, gender, health communication, ethics of healthcare and  research. The interventions proposed need to be evidence-based,  context-specific and resource- sensitive. 

The AIIMS trauma centre experience highlights the importance of  acknowledging factors beyond the realm of medical treatments in  developing a healthy society. The excessive focus on curative medical  care detracts attention from the much more cost-effective and efficient  option of preventive public health investments that can stem the spread  of infectious diseases and improve nutritional outcomes in the country. 

In 2009 the Government took a landmark decision when it decided to  introduce the National Health Bill, 2009. It recognized health as a  fundamental human right, stating that every citizen has a right to the  highest attainable standard of health and well-being. The draft bill  provided  for the people’s right to health and healthcare; the  obligations of the governments and private institutions; core  principles, norms and standards on rights and obligations; the  institutional structure for implementation and monitoring; and the  judicial machinery for ensuring health rights for all. It also included  an itemized list of the specific public health obligations of the  central and state governments. 

The Bill continues to languish after an initial, brief period of enthusiasm. 

The question of priorities remains in the realm of debate. Some  observers maintain that the diversion of public health resources towards  population control and the use of technocratic drug-based interventions  to tackle specific diseases were responsible for the lack of adequate  investments in public health infrastructure in India. There is some  evidence that investing in preventive public health infrastructure may  be politically less rewarding in a democracy such as India in comparison  to providing private goods such as specialized healthcare. Achievements  in preventive public health such as the absence of epidemics are by  definition negative in nature, unlike achievements in the provision of  specialized curative care. 

In a situation where the health needs of the people are dependent  largely on the unregulated private sector, where there is gross  underinvestment in health, where the rate of decline of either infant or  maternal mortality has been slow, where there has been a resurgence in  communicable diseases, the belief that a credible public health system  is urgently required is getting increasing recognition. A comprehensive  Act that covers the various aspects of healthcare rights, delivery and  related matters is a pressing need. 

Our public expenditure on health, particularly public health continues  to be low. What is required is an increase in financial commitment both  by the Centre and the States towards public health concerns in order to  make the 1978 Alma Ata declaration of “Health for All” a reality. 

I compliment the faculty, staff and administrators of this Institute for  their dedication and hard work that has made this Institute a renowned  centre of research and learning and congratulate the successful  students.”

The Vice  President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that the NCC is  shaping the character and moral fibre of our young people, and  ultimately the effectiveness and dynamism of the nation. He was  addressing after inaugurating the NCC Republic Day Camp 2017, here  today. 
The Vice  President said that through programmes like the NCC, the Government of  India is investing in today’s youth and India’s future. If the youth of a  country are educated and willing to go the extra mile to effect  positive change, nothing can prevent the country from greatness, he  added. 
 Addressing  the NCC Cadets, the Vice President said that they are a model to the  youth of the country and their conduct must be exemplary and just. He  urged them to continue with this hard work and achieve their dreams and  goals with dedication and distinction.
 Following is the text of Vice President’s address:
 “I am  delighted to be here for the Republic Day Camp of the National Cadet  Corps. I extend my greetings and best wishes for a bright and prosperous  New Year to all of you.
 The NCC, with its motto of Ekta aur Anushasan (Unity and Discipline) has been  providing our young people with opportunities for self-development and  avenues to fulfil their potential for growth. In so doing, NCC is  playing an important role in shaping the character and moral fibre of  our young people, and ultimately the effectiveness and dynamism of the  nation.
 I am happy  to see the bright and young cadets, smartly turned out and beaming with  confidence. You showcase the dynamism and energy of youth with the  discipline and camaraderie instilled by the NCC.  
 I am sure  that the Republic Day Camp will be a memorable, interesting and learning  experience for each one of you. It will give you an opportunity to  interact with cadets not only from other parts of the country, but also  from friendly foreign countries, who will be joining you shortly.  Experiences such as this camp highlight the essence of universal  brotherhood transcending and help you learn valuable life and work  skills such as teamwork and leadership.
 Your  experience in NCC will equip you to become active, responsible members  of your communities and that you will go on to make valuable  contributions to Indian society on a daily basis in terms of  environmental and community activities.
 Through  programmes like the NCC, the Government of India is investing in today’s  youth and India’s future. The youth of a nation determine how it shapes  up a few years into the future; they are the future of the country, and  their actions and inaction, both contribute to the state of the nation.  If the youth of a country are educated and willing to go the extra mile  to effect positive change, nothing can prevent the country from  greatness.
 The NCC  takes upon itself to provide motivated leadership in all walks of life  through interactive curriculum and activities like NCC Republic Day  Camp. NCC is dedicated to fostering the spirit of adventure among the  youth, but also inculcates social responsibilities and encourages cadets  to contribute towards AIDS awareness, Cancer Awareness, Adult  education, Anti Dowry, Anti Drugs, Organ Donation and Cleanliness  programmes. Your contributions towards social causes have been  recognized and a several awards conferred on you. I compliment you on  your efforts. The nation is indeed very proud of you.  
 You are a  model to the youth of the country. Your conduct must be exemplary and  just. I urge you to continue with this hard work and achieve your dreams  and goals with dedication and distinction.
 I am impressed by your turnout today and I would like to congratulate you all for the same.
 I have great  pleasure in inaugurating the Annual National Cadet Corps Republic Day  Camp 2017, may you derive maximum benefit from it.
 Jai Hind.”

                The 2017 Budget Session of Parliament gets underway today.  The President’s Address to the Parliament, Budget and detailed discussion on several issues will take place during the Session.

In the recent past, there has been discussions with all the Political Parties individually and collectively.  It is imperative to ensure that this Session should be utilised for a constructive debate in the larger interests of the public and yet at the same time, detailed discussions should take place on Budget. 

For the first time, the Union Budget will be presented on 1st February.  You may recall that earlier the Union Budget was presented at 5.00 pm.  Its timing was changed in the morning when Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government came into power and Budget was presented just after the commencement of the Parliament Session.

Yet another new tradition comes into effect from today.  Budget is being presented one month ahead and the rail Budget has now become a part of the Union Budget.  There will be extensive debate in the Parliament on this issue and it will also reflect the ensuing benefits from the decision in the days to come.  I am optimistic that all political parties will join hands to ensure a healthy debate in the Parliament in the larger public interest.

                2017 में संसद का आज सत्र आरंभ हो रहा है। राष्‍ट्रपति जी का उद्बोधन , बजट और काफी लम्‍बे समय तक सत्र के दरमियां अनेक विषयों पर संवाद। पिछले दिनों सभी राजनीतिक दलों के साथ सामूहिक रूप से, व्‍यक्तिगत रूप से लगातार चर्चा हुई है। सत्र का सर्वाधिक उपयोग जनहित के लिए हो, सार्थक चर्चा हो, बजट की भी बारीकी से चर्चा हो। 

पहली बार बजट एक फरवरी को हो रहा है। आप सबको स्‍मरण होगा हमारे देश में पहले बजट शाम को पांच बजे प्रस्‍तुत किया जाता था। जब अटल जी की सरकार थी, तब से उसे समय परिवर्तित करके सुबह सदन प्रारंभ होते ही बजट शुरू हुआ। 

आज एक और नयी परंपरा का प्रारंभ हो रहा है। एक तो बजट करीब एक महीने पहले आ रहा है। दूसरा इसके साथ रेल बजट भी जोड़ दिया गया है। सदन में इस पर व्‍यापक चर्चा होगी और उससे आने वाले दिनों में क्‍या लाभ होने वाले हैं, यह भी मुखर हो करके आएगा। 

मैं सभी राजनीतिक दलों से, मेरा विश्‍वास है कि वह इस बार सदन को उत्‍तम चर्चा के साथ जनहित के काम को आगे बढ़ाने में उपयोग करेंगे। 

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                The  Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has called for a collective effort  to completely eliminate the ‘treatable disease’ of leprosy from India. 
In  a message on the occasion of anti-leprosy day, the Prime Minister said  that we have to work together for socio-economic uplift of the cured  persons and for their contribution in nation-building. He said we have  to strive hard to ensure that these citizens of our country lead a life  with dignity that Mahatma Gandhi dreamt of. 
The  Prime Minister recalled that Mahatma Gandhi had an enduring concern for  people afflicted with leprosy. His vision was not just to treat them,  but also to mainstream them into our society, he added. 
The  Prime Minister said that the effort to eliminate leprosy from this  country under the National Leprosy Eradication Programme is a tribute to  Mahatma Gandhi’s vision. He recalled that this programme was launched  way back in 1955. He noted that the goal of leprosy elimination as a  public health problem i.e., prevalence rate of less than 1 case per  10,000 population at national level was achieved in 2005. He said that  although the case detection rate thereafter has marginally decreased,  visible deformity at the time of diagnosis has increased. He said that  as a country, we have to leave no stone unturned to not just reach the  last mile but also to work together to eliminate the social stigma  attached with this disease. 
The  Prime Minister mentioned that a three-pronged strategy for early  detection of leprosy cases in the community was introduced in 2016 under  the National Health Mission, especially in the hard-to-reach areas. A  special Leprosy Case Detection Campaign was carried out in 2016. As a  result, more than 32000 cases were confirmed and were put on treatment.  In addition, persons who are in close contact with the patients were  also given medicine to reduce the chances of occurrence of the disease  in them.

                My fellow citizens, my namaskar to all of you! 26th January, our  Republic Day was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every nook and  corner of the nation by all of us. The Constitution of India, the duties  of citizens, the rights of citizens and our commitment to democracy -  these in a way make Republic Day also a festival of ‘sanskaars’, which  makes our future generations cognizant of democracy and their democratic  responsibilities, and also imparts to them the culture, moral values  and norms inherent in our democracy. But still in our country, the  duties and rights of citizens are not being debated and discussed as  intensively and extensively as it should be done. I hope that the amount  of emphasis that is given to the rights at every level during most of  the time, is also given to discussing duties of citizens in an emphatic  manner. The rights and duties of the citizens constitute the railway  track, on which the train of democracy in India can move ahead at a fast  pace. 

Tomorrow is 30th January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu. All  of us pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the  motherland, by observing silence for 2 minutes at 11 am on 30th January.  As a society, as a nation, the 2 minute tribute of silence on 30th  January at 11 am, should become our instinctive nature. This 2 minutes  silence is an expression of our collective resolve and reverence for the  martyrs. 

In our country there is an innate respect for the military and the  security forces. I congratulate and felicitate the young heroes and  their families who were honoured with various gallantry awards on the  eve of this Republic Day. There are various categories of these  gallantry awards like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Vishisht Seva Medal  and Param Vishisht Seva Medal. I want to urge the youth especially that  since you are very active on social media, you can do one thing. Surf  the Net to do some research on the valiant bravehearts, who have been  bestowed with these honours, compose a few good lines about them and  share these with your friends and companions. When we get to know the in  depth details of their courage, bravery, valour in detail, we are  filled with astonishment and pride and we also get inspired! 

While we were all delighted with the tidings of enthusiasm and  celebration of 26th January, at the same time, some of our army Jawans  posted in Kashmir for the defense of the country, achieved martyrdom due  to the avalanche. I respectfully pay my homage to all these brave  soldiers, I bow to them. 

My young friends, you know very well that I regularly do my ‘Mann Ki  Baat’. January, February, March, April – all these are for every family,  months of most severe test! Normally it is one or two children in a  home due to appear at their exams, but the entire family feels the  burden of it. This led me to believe that this is the right time for me  to talk to my student friends, their guardians and their teachers,  because for many years now, wherever I have gone, whomsoever I have met,  examination appeared to be a great source of anxiety. Troubled  families, harassed students, tense teachers – one sees a very strange  psychological atmosphere prevailing in each home! And I have always felt  that we should come out of this situation and, therefore, today I want  to talk in some detail with my young friends. When I’d declared that I  would talk on this topic, many teachers, guardians and students sent me  their messages, questions, suggestions and also expressed their anguish  and narrated their problems. And after going through all these  outpourings, some ideas came to my mind, which I want to share with you  today. I received a telephonic message from Srishti. You too listen to  what Srishti has to say: -

“Sir, I want to tell you that during exam time, very often in our homes,  in the neighbourhood and in our society, a very terrifying and scary  atmosphere pervades. This leads to a situation, where the students  instead of feeling inspired feel tremendously down. So I just want to  ask you this, can’t this be transformed into a pleasant atmosphere?” 

Well, the question has been posed by Srishti, but it is a question that  must be there in the minds of all of you. Exams in themselves, should be  a joyous occasion. After a year of hard work, one has the opportunity  to display one’s capabilities, so this should be a festival of joy and  enthusiasm. But there are very few people for whom there is pleasure in  the exam; for most people exam means pressure! Now, it is up to you to  decide whether you consider the exams pleasure or pressure. Those who  will consider it a pleasure, will have achievements, while those who  will consider exams a pressure, will have to repent. And therefore my  opinion is that exams are like a festival and, hence, must be  celebrated. And when there is a festive mood of celebration, the best  within us comes out. The true realisation of the strength of a society  also takes place during festivals. The best of everything finds a  manifestation. Usually, we think of ourselves as a highly undisciplined  lot, but if we just look at the arrangements made during the Kumbh  Melas, which are celebrated for about 40-45 days, these despite being  essentially make-shift arrangements, display the great discipline  practised by people. This is the inherent strength of a festival. Hence,  during examinations too, an atmosphere of festivity should be created  in the whole family, amongst friends and around the neighbourhood. And  you will see for yourself, that the pressure will be converted into  pleasure. The festive atmosphere will lead to a burden-free environment.  And I especially urge the parents to create a festive atmosphere during  these 3-4 months. All the family members have to work as a team and  play with zeal their respective roles to make this festival of  examination a success. You will witness for yourself the ensuing change.  Actually from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup and from  Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these 3-4 months have examinations galore.  It is the responsibility of each one of us that in our own ways,  observing our respective traditions and in tune with our respective  family surroundings, we should strive to transform every year these 3-4  months into a festival. And therefore I shall say to you 'Smile More  Score More'! The more time these days you will spend being happy, the  more will be the number of marks you will earn! Just try and see for  yourselves! And you must have noticed that when you are happy, you are  smiling, you become relaxed automatically, and when you relax  instinctively, you’re able to recollect very old things also quite  effortlessly! A year ago, what the teacher had taught in the classroom,  the whole scenario reappears in front of you. And you must know that the  power of memory to recall is greatest when we are relaxed. If you are  tense, then all the doors seem to be closed, nothing can enter from  outside and nothing can come out from inside. The thought process comes  to a standstill and that in itself becomes a burden. You must have seen  for yourself that during the examinations also, you’re able to recall  everything else - the book, the chapter, the page number, whether what  you want is there on the top of the page or at its bottom, you can  recall everything but not the particular word you want to. But as soon  as you finish the examination and exit from the examination hall,  suddenly you recollect that very word. And you say to yourself – Yes,  Man, that was the word I wanted! Why you could not remember the word  inside the hall, was due to the pressure. And how you could recall it  outside? It was the same you, nobody had now told you the answer! What  happened was that whatever was inside, came out immediately and the  reason was that you were now relaxed. And therefore the most effective  medicine that exists for memory recall is relaxation. And it is by my  own personal experience that I’m telling you that if you’re under  pressure then you forget even your own things but if you are relaxed,  then you can’t even imagine the kind of things you are able to remember,  and these become extremely useful. It is not that you do not have the  knowledge, it is not that you do not have the information, and it is not  that you have not worked hard! But when there is tension, your  knowledge, your wisdom, your information – all these buckle under and  the tension rides over you. And therefore it is necessary to remember  that 'a happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet’! Sometimes it  also appears that we are not able to perceive examinations in a proper  perspective. It seems to become a question of life and death. See, the  exam you are going to appear at is the exam of what you have studied  during this whole year. But it is not a test of your life. It is not a  test of what kind of life have you lived, how is the life you are living  now and what is the life you aspire to live. There must have been many  occasions in your life, when, besides the examinations that you appeared  at inside the classrooms with notebooks, you had to encounter and  endure many tests and trials. And thus success and failure in life is  not determined at all by how one has done at the examination; this is a  burden from which you must free yourself. We all have before us the  extremely inspiring example of our former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul  Kalam. He appeared at the test for recruitment into the Air Force, and  failed in that. Now suppose that this failure had caused him to become  dejected, to concede defeat in his life, then would India have found  such a great scientist and such a glorious President? No, never! One  Richa Anand Ji has sent me this question: -

“Today what I see as the biggest challenge facing the education is that  it has come to focus solely on examinations. Marks have become all  important. As a result, the competition has multiplied leading to a very  high increase of stress in the students also. So I would like to know  your views concerning the current direction of education and its future  course.” 

Although she herself has given the answer to her query, but Richa Ji  wishes that I too must put forth my views on the matter. Marks and  mark-sheet serve a limited purpose. Life is not confined to these only.  Life truly means what is the knowledge that you have acquired! Life  truly goes on in terms of whether whatever you have learned, you have  tried to live that also! Life moves ahead depending upon the condition  that whatever the sense of mission you have achieved and whatever is the  sense of ambition that you nurture, whether there is any ongoing  co-ordination between your sense of mission and your sense of ambition!  If you will have faith in these things, then marks will automatically  follow you and you will never have to chase marks! It is the knowledge  that is going to be of use to you in life, so are skill, self-confidence  and determination. You tell me, you must be having a family doctor to  whom all the members of your family must be going whenever needed. There  would not be a single person in your family who might have asked that  family doctor as to how many marks did he score while passing his exam.  None could have raised this question. All of you would have thought that  as a doctor he was good, you were finding relief in his treatment and  thus you started taking his services regularly. When you have to fight a  big law suit and you go to a lawyer to engage his services, do you look  at the mark-sheet of that lawyer? You only look at his experience, his  knowledge, and the graph of his success. And therefore this burden of  hankering for marks hinders us sometimes from going in the right  direction. But that does not mean that I’m implying that you don’t have  to study at all. Studies are definitely useful for testing our own  mettle; to know where I stood yesterday and where I stand today. But  this also happens sometimes and if you analyse minutely the journey of  your own life, you will realise that if you start running after marks,  you will look for the shortest ways, and will identify a few selected  things and focus on those only. But if something comes from outside  those few things you had touched upon; a question comes which is outside  the bunch of selected questions that you had prepared; you will be find  yourself slipping to the rock bottom. If you have pursuit of knowledge  as your focal point, then by itself you try to acquire and attain a lot  more. However if you concentrate and focus only on getting marks, then  you gradually go on limiting yourself and confine yourself to certain  areas for earning more marks. Thus, you may find that despite becoming  brilliant in passing the exams, you have sometimes failed in life. 

Richa Ji had also mentioned about ‘PRATISPARDHA’, meaning 'competition  with others'. It is a huge psychological battle. In reality, it is not  the competition with others that takes us ahead in life but it is  competing with ourselves or ‘ANUSPARDHA’, which takes our life forward.  How can tomorrow be made better than yesterday! How can a future  occasion be used to improve upon the past results. To make myself  instantly clear, I shall cite an example from the field of sports. It is  a feature in the life of most of the successful players that they  compete with themselves. Let us take the example of Mr. Sachin  Tendulkar. He kept on breaking his own records consecutively and  consistently for about twenty years, everytime surpassing and outdoing  himself and thus continuously forging ahead. What a wonderful journey of  life he has had, only because he followed the route of competing with  himself rather than competing with others! 

Friends, in every field of life and when taking exams, if you were able  to study peacefully for two hours earlier, then are you now able to do  so for three hours? If you couldn’t wake up at the decided time in the  morning and were thus delayed, now can you get up early on time? You  couldn’t sleep earlier due to exam tension, are you able to sleep now?  Put yourself to test, and you’ll find that a defeat in competition with  others results in frustration, disappointment, despair and jealousy, but  ‘Anuspardha’ or ‘competition with self’ leads to self-analysis and  introspection and makes our determination stronger and more resolute.  And when we prevail over ourselves, then the motivation to do better  becomes innate, you don’t need any external sources of energy. That  energy is generated from within on its own. If I have to put it in a  simple language, then I would say that when you compete with someone  else, there are three broad possibilities that arise - first, that you  are much better than him; second, that you are much worse than him; and  the third that you are equal to him. If you are better than your  competitor, then you will become complacent,as you will be filled with  over-confidence. If you perform poorly against him, you will become  distressed and disappointed, will be filled with envy, that will devour  and consume you. And if you are equal to your competitor, then you will  never feel the need to improve, life will just go on at its own pace.  Therefore I urge you to engage in ‘Anuspardha’, or ‘competition with  self’. You must focus on how to improve upon your past performance and  how to perform even better. And you’ll witness for yourself the positive  change that it will bring about in you. 

Shriman S. Sunder Ji has expressed his feelings on the role of parents.  He says that during exams, parents have a vital role to play. He further  writes, “My mother was not educated. Yet, she would sit by me and ask  me to solve problems in Mathematics. She would then compare answers and  thus be of great help to me. She would help me rectify errors. My mother  did not clear the Class 10 exam, yet without her aid, it would have  been impossible for me to pass the CBSE exam.” 

Sunder Ji, what you say is absolutely correct. And you must have  observed today also that women are a majority amongst those who ask me  questions or send in suggestions. Mothers who are consciously aware of  and actively alert to their children’s future, play a big role in  assuaging the atmosphere at home. I shall urge parents to lay emphasis  on just three points - acceptance, mentoring and sharing time. Accept  things as they are. Whatever capabilities you posses, use these to  mentor your children, and, howsoever occupied you might be, spare time  for them, be with them. Once you learn to accept, maximum number of  problems will be solved there and then. Every parent must be  experiencing this. Expectation on the part of parents and teachers is  the root cause of the problem. Acceptance brings about new avenues in  finding solutions to problems. Expectations make the path difficult.  Accepting a certain state provides us with the opportunity of opening up  newer vistas. Just accept things as they are. You will feel much  lighter. We keep deliberating on the heavy weight of our tiny tots‘  school bags, but there are times when I feel that expectations and  aspirations on the part of parents are far too heavier compared to those  school bags. 

Once, many years ago, one of our acquaintances was admitted to a  hospital, following a heart attack. Former M.P. Purushottam Mavlankar,  son of India’s first Lok Sabha Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavlankar, had come  to the hospital to see him. I was present there and I saw that he did  not ask a single question on the state of his health; he just sat down  with no reference to the ailment or to the situation. He started  cracking jokes and lightened the atmosphere in a matter of just a few  minutes. In a way, we terrify a patient with constant references to his  ailment. I would like to convey to parents that we do exactly the same  with our children. Have you ever thought of creating an atmosphere of  joy and laughter for children during exams? See it for yourself, the  whole ambience will be transformed. 

I have received an incredible phone call. The gentleman does not wish to  reveal his name. When you listen to the call, you will come to know why  he does not want to identify himself! 

“Namaskar, Pradhan Mantriji, I cannot divulge my name because of  something that I did in my childhood. Once, when I was young, I had made  an attempt to cheat in my exams. And I started preparing most  thoroughly for that. I tried to explore and find out various methods of  copying and wasted a lot of time because of that. I could have very well  secured the same marks by devoting that time to studying, which I  wasted while pondering how to copy. Moreover, when I tried to use unfair  means to pass the exam, I got caught and a lot of my friends around me  also had to undergo distress because of me.” 

What you say is right. These shortcut ways become the reason for using  unfair means. There are times when not having enough confidence in  oneself makes one crave to peep into a fellow student’s answer sheet,  may be just to confirm if one has written the correct answer. Sometimes  it happens that our own answer is correct and the other’s answer is  wrong. But we somehow believe that the other’s actually wrong answer is  the right one, which leads to our own undoing as well. Thus unfair means  lead us nowhere. ‘To cheat is to be cheap, so please do not cheat’.  Cheating makes you bad, so stay away from it. Time and again you must  have heard advisories on staying away from unfair means. I am  reiterating the same, once again. Look at the scourge of cheating,  copying and such unfair means from any angle and in any form; it is  surely going to drag you into the abyss of failure in life. Over and  above that, if the invigilator catches you cheating during the exam, you  will be utterly ruined. And suppose, you are not caught, even then your  own conscience will be burdened for lifetime. When the time will come  to counsel your own children, you will not be able to look them clearly  in the eye, burdened as you will be with your own sense of guilt. And  once you are habituated to using unfair means, you will never feel the  desire to actually learn anything in life. Where will you reach then? 

It is as if you are yourself digging holes in your pathways. And, I have  seen that there are people who squander so much of their  talent,  invest their entire creativity in finding ingenious ways and means in  designing unfair methods. If one devotes the same time and the same  creativity in addressing issues pertaining to exams, one would never  require any unfair means in the first place. Results that you achieve  through your own hard work and diligence will invest you with a  phenomenal and extra-ordinary self-confidence. 

Now listen to this phone call, which I have received: -

“Namaskar, Pradhan Mantri Ji, my name is Monica and since I am a  class  12th student, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions regarding the  Board Exams. My first question is, what can we do to reduce the stress  that builds up during our exams and my second question is, why are exams  all about work and no play. Thank you.” 

During exam days, if I talk about sports and games, your teachers, your  parents will be angry with me. “What kind of a Prime Minister is this,  who is asking children to come out and play during exams,” they might  say! People generally nurse the notion that if students indulge in  sporting activities, they become careless about their studies. This  notion is basically unfounded. It is the root cause of this problem. If  one has to achieve holistic development, the fact is that there exists a  huge world, a life beyond books; and this precisely is the time to  learn living that life also. If someone says, “Let me finish with all  exams first, I will play and do other things later”; well, that is  impossible. This is THE time for moulding one’s life. This is what  upbringing is all about. As a matter of fact, in my opinion, three  things are crucial – proper rest, the other is the requisite amount of  sleep, the third is the body, which is a major component, way beyond  mental activity. Other parts of the body too require physical activity.  With so much to do, have you ever thought of spending a couple of  moments gazing at the sky, looking with wonder at the flora around you,  lightening your spirits a bit! You will notice that you will return to  your study room and be amongst your books with a renewed freshness.  Whatever you are doing, take a break, have a stroll outside, enter the  kitchen, look for something that you relish to eat, munch on your  favourite biscuit if possible, tell or listen jokes and laugh for a  while. If only for five minutes, give yourself a break. You will feel  the onset of a certain ease in your work. I do not know if everyone  likes this or not, but I am saying it out of personal experience. Deep  breathing during these times is very beneficial. It relaxes you. And for  deep breathing you do not need to confine yourself to your room. Just  be under the open sky, go to the roof top, do deep breathing for five  minutes and return to your studies. You will experience relaxation in  your body. A relaxed body equally relaxes your mental organs. Some of  you feel like studying more and more, keeping awake for late hours in  the night. No. Ensure adequate sleep for the body that is required. It  will help you avoid wastage of study time; it will enhance your ability  to study well. Your concentration will increase. You will feel a certain  freshness. Your overall efficiency will rise by leaps and bounds. When I  address election rallies, sometimes I suffer from a sore throat or a  hoarse voice. Once a folk singer came to meet me. He asked me, “How many  hours do you sleep?” I asked him if he was a doctor. He said, “No, but  it is linked with your voice problem brought on by delivering so many  election speeches. Only when you get adequate sleep, your vocal chords  will be able to rest fully.” Well, I had never given a thought to a  possible connection between my sleep, my speeches and my voice. It was  as if he had given me a herbal panacea. Actually, we should understand  the importance of these things, it will surely benefit you. But this  does not mean that you keep sleeping all the time. Some might remark  that since the Prime Minister has said so, just keep sleeping, there is  no need to wake up and study. Please, do not do that, else your family  members will be displeased with me. And when your mark sheet arrives, if  they are not happy with that, they will not see you but only me. So,  avoid doing that. And hence I will say, “P for prepare and P for play’,  one who plays blossoms, the person who plays, shines. This is a  wonderful remedy for maintaining the vigour of the mind, brain and body.  

Anyway, young friends, you are engrossed in preparing for your exams and  here I am, engaging you in matters close to my heart. Of course, it is  quite possible that my words this morning will act as a relaxant for  you. In the same breath, I will add that do not let these remarks of  mine be a burden on you. Do it only if you can. If you cannot do it,  please do not do it, else this too will weigh heavily on you. Just as I  advise your parents not to be burdensome to you, the same applies to me  too. Keeping your resolve in mind, with confidence in yourself, set out  for your exams. My best wishes to your. In order to clear a test, treat  the test as a festive occasion.  You will never feel a test, a test  again. Make headway with this Mantra. 

My dear countrymen, on 1st February 2017, Indian Coast Guard is  completing 40 years. On this occasion I extend my heartfelt gratitude to  all the officers and jawans of Coast Guard for their service to the  Nation. It is a matter of pride and honour that with its indigenously  built 126 ships and 62 aircrafts, it has carved a coveted place for  itself amongst the 4 biggest Coast Guards of the world. The motto of  Coast Guard is ‘Vayam Rakshaamaha.’ We protect. True in letter and  spirit to the motto, securing the country’s maritime borders and  maritime environment, the jawans of Coast Guard are relentlessly at work  night and day, braving the most adverse conditions. Last year,  personnel of Coast Guard undertook a campaign of cleaning up of our  coastal areas also, over and above their routine duties. Thousands  participated in this campaign. Along with coastal security, they  displayed concern towards coastal cleanliness and deserve accolades for  their act. Not many people would be aware that in our Coast Guard, not  just men, but women too are discharging their duties and  responsibilities shoulder to shoulder, and most successfully. Our Coast  Guard women officers are pilots, work as Observers, and not just that,  they command Hovercrafts as well. In the backdrop of the fact that  maritime security today has become an issue of global concern and the  excellence displayed by Coast Guard in securing India’s coast line, I  extend my heartiest felicitations to them on their 40th birthday. 

1st February is the festival of Vasant Panchami. Vasant, that is Spring,  is acknowledged as the best of seasons. Vasant is RITURAJ, the king of  seasons. In our country, Saraswati Pooja is done on Vasant Panchami;  Vasant Panchmi is a major festival. It is considered an occasion to  worship Vidya, knowledge. And not just that, it is a celebration of  inspiration for brave hearts. ‘Mera Rang de Basanti Chola’ is a perfect  example of that. I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the pious  occasion of Vasant Panchami. 

My dear countrymen, in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, All India Radio too infuses  myriad novel hues of creativity and imagination. Last month onwards,  they have started broadcasting versions in regional languages,  immediately after the broadcast of my ‘Mann Ki Baat’. This has gained  wide acceptance. People are writing in from far and wide. I felicitate  All India Radio for this self-inspired initiative from the core of my  heart. ‘Mann Ki Baat’ gives me a great opportunity to be connected with  you. Best wishes to you. Thank you.

                मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आप सबको नमस्कार। 26 जनवरी, हमारा ‘गणतंत्र दिवस’  देश के कोने-कोने में उमंग और उत्साह के साथ हम सबने मनाया। भारत का  संविधान, नागरिकों के कर्तव्य, नागरिकों के  अधिकार, लोकतंत्र के प्रति  हमारी प्रतिबद्धता, एक प्रकार से ये संस्कार उत्सव भी है, जो आने वाली  पीढ़ियों को लोकतंत्र के प्रति, लोकतान्त्रिक जिम्मेवारियों के प्रति,  जागरूक भी करता है, संस्कारित भी करता है। लेकिन अभी भी हमारे देश में,  नागरिकों के कर्तव्य और नागरिकों के  अधिकार - उस पर जितनी बहस होनी चाहिए,  जितनी गहराई से बहस होनी चाहिए, जितनी व्यापक रूप में चर्चा होनी चाहिए,  वो अभी नहीं हो रही है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि हर स्तर पर, हर वक़्त, जितना बल  अधिकारों पर दिया जाता है, उतना ही बल कर्तव्यों पर भी दिया जाए। अधिकार  और कर्तव्य की दो पटरी पर ही, भारत के लोकतंत्र की गाड़ी तेज़ गति से आगे बढ़  सकती है। 

कल 30 जनवरी है, हमारे पूज्य बापू की पुण्य तिथि है। 30 जनवरी को  हम सब सुबह 11 बजे, 2 मिनट मौन रख करके, देश के लिए प्राण न्योछावर करने  वाले शहीदों को श्रद्धांजलि देते हैं। एक समाज के रूप में, एक देश के रूप  में, 30 जनवरी, 11 बजे 2 मिनट श्रद्धांजलि, यह सहज स्वभाव बनना चाहिए। 2  मिनट क्यों न हो, लेकिन उसमें सामूहिकता भी, संकल्प भी और शहीदों के प्रति  श्रद्धा भी अभिव्यक्त होती है। 

हमारे देश में सेना के प्रति, सुरक्षा बलों के प्रति, एक सहज आदर  भाव प्रकट होता रहता है। इस गणतंत्र दिवस की पूर्व संध्या पर, विभिन्न  वीरता पुरस्कारों से, जो वीर-जवान सम्मानित हुए, उनको, उनके परिवारजनों को,  मैं बधाई देता हूँ। इन पुरस्कारों में, ‘कीर्ति चक्र’, ‘शौर्य चक्र’, ‘परम  विशिष्ट सेवा मेडल’, ‘विशिष्ट सेवा मेडल’ - अनेक श्रेणियाँ हैं। मैं ख़ास  करके नौजवानों से आग्रह करना चाहता हूँ। आप social media में बहुत active  हैं। आप एक काम कर सकते हैं? इस बार, जिन-जिन वीरों को ये सम्मान मिला है -  आप Net पर खोजिए, उनके संबंध में दो अच्छे शब्द लिखिए और अपने साथियों में  उसको पहुँचाइए। जब उनके साहस की, वीरता की, पराक्रम की बात को गहराई से  जानते हैं, तो हमें आश्चर्य भी होता है, गर्व भी होता है, प्रेरणा भी मिलती  है। 

एक तरफ़ हम सब 26 जनवरी की उमंग और उत्साह की ख़बरों से आनंदित थे,  तो उसी समय कश्मीर में हमारे जो सेना के जवान देश की रक्षा में डटे हुए  हैं, वे हिमस्खलन के कारण वीर-गति को प्राप्त हुए। मैं इन सभी वीर जवानों  को आदरपूर्वक श्रद्धांजलि देता हूँ, नमन करता हूँ। 

मेरे युवा साथियो, आप तो भली-भाँति जानते हैं कि मैं ‘मन की बात’  लगातार करता रहता हूँ। जनवरी, फ़रवरी, मार्च, अप्रैल - ये सारे महीने हर  परिवार में, कसौटी के महीने होते हैं। घर में एक-आध, दो बच्चों की exam  होती हैं, लेकिन पूरा परिवार exam के बोझ में दबा हुआ होता है। तो मेरा मन  कर गया कि ये सही समय है कि मैं विद्यार्थी दोस्तों से बातें करूँ, उनके  अभिवावकों से बातें करूँ, उनके शिक्षकों से बातें करूँ। क्योंकि कई वर्षों  से, मैं जहाँ गया, जिसे मिला, परीक्षा एक बहुत बड़ा परेशानी का कारण नज़र  आया। परिवार परेशान, विद्यार्थी परेशान, शिक्षक परेशान, एक बड़ा विचित्र सा  मनोवैज्ञानिक वातावरण हर घर में नज़र आता है। और मुझे हमेशा ये लगा है कि  इसमें से बाहर आना चाहिये और इसलिये मैं आज युवा साथियों के साथ कुछ  विस्तार से बातें करना चाहता हूँ। जब ये विषय मैंने घोषित किया, तो अनेक  शिक्षकों ने, अभिभावकों ने, विद्यार्थियों ने मुझे message भेजे, सवाल  भेजे, सुझाव भेजे, पीड़ा भी व्यक्त की, परेशानियों का भी ज़िक्र किया और उसको  देखने के बाद जो मेरे मन में विचार आए, वो मैं आज आपके साथ साझा करना  चाहता हूँ। मुझे एक टेलीफोन सन्देश मिला सृष्टि का। आप भी सुनिए, सृष्टि  क्या कह रही है: -  

“सर, मैं आपसे इतना कहना चाहती हूँ कि exams के time पे अक्सर ऐसा  होता है कि हमारे घर में, आस-पड़ोस में, हमारी society में   बहुत ही  ख़ौफ़नाक और डरावना माहौल बन जाता है। इस वजह से student Inspiration तो कम,  लेकिन down बहुत हो जाते है। तो मैं आपसे इतना पूछना चाहती हूँ कि क्या ये  माहौल ख़ुशनुमा नहीं हो सकता?”  

खैर, सवाल तो सृष्टि ने पूछा है, लेकिन ये सवाल आप सबके मन में  होगा। परीक्षा अपने-आप में एक ख़ुशी का अवसर होना चाहिये। साल भर मेहनत की  है, अब बताने का अवसर आया है, ऐसा उमंग-उत्साह का ये पर्व होना चाहिए। बहुत  कम लोग हैं, जिनके लिए exam में pleasure होती है, ज़्यादातर लोगों के लिए  exam एक pressure होती है। निर्णय आपको करना है कि इसे आप pleasure मानेंगे  कि pressure मानेंगे। जो pleasure मानेगा, वो पायेगा; जो pressure मानेगा,  वो पछताएगा। और इसलिये मेरा मत है कि परीक्षा एक उत्सव है, परीक्षा को ऐसे  लीजिए, जैसे मानो त्योहार है। और जब त्योहार होता है, जब उत्सव होता है,  तो हमारे भीतर जो सबसे best होता है, वही बाहर निकल कर के आता है। समाज की  भी ताक़त की अनुभूति उत्सव के समय होती है। जो उत्तम से उत्तम है, वो प्रकट  होता है। सामान्य रूप से हमको लगता है कि हम लोग कितने Indisciplined हैं,  लेकिन जब 40-45 दिन चलने वाले कुम्भ के मेलों की व्यवस्था देखें, तो पता  चलता है कि ये make-shift arrangement और क्या discipline है लोगों में। ये  उत्सव की ताक़त है। exam में भी पूरे परिवार में, मित्रों के बीच, आस-पड़ोस  के बीच एक उत्सव का माहौल बनना चाहिये। आप देखिए, ये pressure, pleasure  में convert हो जाएगा। उत्सवपूर्ण वातावरण बोझमुक्त बना देगा। और मैं इसमें  माता-पिता को ज़्यादा आग्रह से कहता हूँ कि आप इन तीन-चार महीने एक उत्सव  का वातावरण बनाइए। पूरा परिवार एक टीम के रूप में इस उत्सव को सफल करने के  लिए अपनी-अपनी भूमिका उत्साह से निभाए। देखिए, देखते ही देखते बदलाव आ  जाएगा। हक़ीक़त तो ये है कि कन्याकुमारी से कश्मीर तक और कच्छ से ले करके  कामरूप तक, अमरेली से ले करके अरुणाचल प्रदेश तक, ये तीन-चार महीने परीक्षा  ही परीक्षायें  होती हैं। ये हम सब का दायित्व है कि हम हर वर्ष इन  तीन-चार महीनों को अपने-अपने तरीक़े से, अपनी-अपनी परंपरा को लेते हुए,  अपने-अपने परिवार के वातावरण को लेते हुए, उत्सव में परिवर्तित करें। और  इसलिए मैं तो आपसे कहूँगा ‘smile more score more’. जितनी ज़्यादा ख़ुशी से  इस समय को बिताओगे, उतने ही ज़्यादा नंबर पाओगे, करके देखिए। और आपने देखा  होगा कि जब आप खुश होते हैं, मुस्कुराते हैं, तो आप relax अपने-आप को पाते  हैं। आप सहज रूप से relax हो जाते हैं और जब आप relax होते हैं, तो आपकी  वर्षों पुरानी बातें भी सहज रूप से आपको याद आ जाती हैं। एक साल पहले  classroom में teacher ने क्या कहा, पूरा दृश्य याद आ जाता है। और आपको ये  पता होना चाहिए, memory को recall करने का जो power है, वो relaxation में  सबसे ज़्यादा होता है। अगर आप तनाव में है, तो सारे दरवाज़े बंद हो जाते हैं,  बाहर का अंदर नहीं जाता, अंदर का बाहर नहीं आता है। विचार प्रक्रिया में  ठहराव आ जाता है, वो अपने-आप में एक बोझ बन जाता है। exam में भी आपने देखा  होगा, आपको सब याद आता है। किताब याद आती है, chapter याद आता है, page  number याद आता है, page में ऊपर की तरफ़ लिखा है कि नीचे की तरफ़, वो भी याद  आता है, लेकिन वो particular शब्द याद नहीं आता है। लेकिन जैसे ही exam दे  करके बाहर निकलते हो और थोड़ा सा कमरे के बाहर आए, अचानक आपको याद आ जाता  है - हाँ यार, यही शब्द था। अंदर  क्यों याद नहीं आया, pressure था। बाहर  कैसे याद आया? आप ही तो थे, किसी ने बताया तो नहीं था। लेकिन जो अंदर था,  तुरंत बाहर आ गया और बाहर इसलिये आया, क्योंकि आप relax हो गए। और इसलिये  memory recall करने की सबसे बड़ी अगर कोई औषधि है, तो वो relaxation है। और  ये मैं अपने स्वानुभव से कहता हूँ कि अगर pressure है, तो अपनी चीज़ें हम  भूल जाते हैं और relax हैं, तो कभी हम कल्पना नहीं कर सकते, अचानक ऐसी-ऐसी  चीज़ें याद आ जाती हैं, वो बहुत काम आ जाती हैं। और ऐसा नहीं है कि आप के  पास knowledge नहीं है, ऐसा नहीं है कि आप के पास Information नहीं है, ऐसा  नहीं है कि आपने मेहनत नहीं की है। लेकिन जब tension होता है, तब आपका  knowledge, आपका ज्ञान, आपकी जानकारी नीचे दब जाती हैं और आपका tension उस  पर सवार हो जाता है। और इसलिये आवश्यक है, ‘A happy mind is the secret for  a good mark-sheet’. कभी-कभी ये भी लगता है कि हम proper perspective में  परीक्षा को देख नहीं पाते हैं। ऐसा लगता है कि वो जीवन-मरण का जैसे सवाल  है। आप जो exam देने जा रहे हैं, वो साल भर में आपने जो पढ़ाई की है, उसकी  exam है। ये आपके जीवन की कसौटी नहीं है। आपने कैसा जीवन जिया, कैसा जीवन  जी रहे हो, कैसा जीवन जीना चाहते हो, उसकी exam नहीं है। आपके जीवन में,  classroom में, notebook ले करके दी गई परीक्षा के सिवाय भी कई कसौटियों से  गुज़रने के अवसर आए होंगे। और इसलिये, परीक्षा को जीवन की सफलता-विफलता से  कोई लेना-देना है, ऐसे बोझ से मुक्त हो जाइए। हमारे सबके सामने, हमारे  पूर्व राष्ट्रपति डॉ. ए.पी.जे. अब्दुल कलाम जी का बड़ा प्रेरक उदाहरण है। वे  वायुसेना में भर्ती होने गए, fail हो गए। मान लीजिए, उस विफलता के कारण  अगर वो मायूस हो जाते, ज़िंदगी से हार जाते, तो क्या भारत को इतना बड़ा  वैज्ञानिक मिलता, इतने बड़े राष्ट्रपति मिलते! नहीं मिलते। कोई ऋचा आनंद जी  ने मुझे एक सवाल भेजा है: - 

“आज के इस दौर में शिक्षा के सामने जो सबसे बड़ी चुनौती देख पाती  हूँ, वो यह कि शिक्षा परीक्षा केन्द्रित हो कर रह गयी है। अंक सबसे ज़्यादा  महत्वपूर्ण हो गए हैं। इसकी वजह से प्रतिस्पर्द्धा तो बहुत बढ़ी ही है, साथ  में विद्यार्थियों में तनाव भी बहुत बढ़ गया है। तो शिक्षा की इस वर्तमान  दिशा और इसके भविष्य को ले करके आपके विचारों से अवगत होना चाहूँगी।”     

वैसे उन्होंने ख़ुद ने ही जवाब दे ही दिया है, लेकिन ऋचा जी चाहती  हैं कि मैं भी इसमें कुछ अपनी बात रखूँ। marks और marks-sheet इसका एक  सीमित उपयोग है। ज़िंदगी में वही सब कुछ नहीं होता है। ज़िंदगी तो चलती है कि  आपने कितना ज्ञान अर्जित किया है। ज़िंदगी तो चलती है कि आपने जो जाना है,  उसको जीने का प्रयास किया है क्या? ज़िंदगी तो चलती है कि आपको जो एक sense  of mission मिला है और जो आपका sense of ambition है, ये आपके mission और  ambition के बीच में कोई तालमेल हो रहा है क्या? अगर आप इन चीज़ों में भरोसा  करोगे, तो marks पूँछ दबाते हुए आपके पीछे आ जाएँगे; आपको marks के पीछे  भागने की कभी ज़रुरत नहीं पड़ेगी। जीवन में आपको knowledge काम आने वाला है,  skill काम आने वाली है, आत्मविश्वास काम आने वाला है, संकल्पशक्ति काम आने  वाली है। आप ही मुझे बताइए, आपके परिवार के कोई डॉक्टर होंगे और परिवार के  सब लोग उन्हीं के पास जाते होंगे, family doctor होते हैं। आप में से कोई  ऐसा नहीं होगा, जिसने अपने family doctor को कभी, वो कितने नंबर से पास हुआ  था, पूछा होगा। किसी ने नहीं पूछा होगा। बस, आपको लगा कि भाई, एक डॉक्टर  के नाते अच्छे हैं, आप लोगो को लाभ हो रहा है, आप उसकी सेवाएँ लेना शुरू  किए। आप कोई बड़ा से बड़ा case लड़ने के लिए किसी वकील के पास जाते हैं, तो  क्या उस वकील की marks-sheet देखते हैं क्या? आप उसके अनुभव को, उसके ज्ञान  को, उसकी सफलता की यात्रा को देखते हैं। और इसलिये ये जो अंक का बोझ है,  वो भी कभी-कभी हमें सही दिशा में जाने से रोक देता है। लेकिन इसका मतलब ये  नहीं कि मैं ये कहूँ कि बस, पढ़ना ही नहीं है। अपनी कसौटी के लिए उसका उपयोग  ज़रुर है। मैं कल था, आज कहाँ हूँ, वो जानने के लिए ज़रुरी है। कभी-कभार ये  भी होता है और अगर बारीक़ी से आप अपने स्वयं के जीवन को देखोगे, तो ध्यान  में आएगा कि अगर अंक के पीछे पड़ गए, तो आप shortest रास्ते खोजोगे,  selected चीजों को ही पकड़ोगे और उसी पर focus करोगे। लेकिन आपने जिन चीज़ों  पर हाथ लगाया था, उसके बाहर की कोई चीज़ आ गई, आपने जो सवाल तैयार किए थे,  उससे बाहर का सवाल आ गया, तो आप एकदम से नीचे आ जाएँगे। अगर आप ज्ञान को  केंद्र में रखते हैं, तो बहुत चीज़ों को अपने में समेटने का प्रयास करते हो।  लेकिन अंक पर focus करते हो, marks पर focus करते हो, तो आप धीरे-धीरे  अपने-आप को सिकुड़ते जाते हो और एक निश्चित area तक अपने आपको सीमित करके  सिर्फ marks पाने के लिये। तो हो सकता है कि exam में होनहार बनने के  बावजूद भी जीवन में कभी-कभी विफल हो जाते हैं।  

ऋचा जी, ने एक बात ये भी कही है ‘प्रतिस्पर्द्धा’। ये एक बहुत बड़ी  मनोवैज्ञानिक लड़ाई है। सचमुच में, जीवन को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए प्रतिस्पर्द्धा  काम नहीं आती है। जीवन को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए अनुस्पर्द्धा काम आती है और जब  हम अनुस्पर्द्धा मैं कहता हूँ, तो उसका मतलब है, स्वयं से स्पर्द्धा करना।  बीते हुए कल से आने वाला कल बेहतर कैसे हो? बीते हुए परिणाम से आने वाला  अवसर अधिक बेहतर कैसे हो? अक्सर आपने खेल जगत में देखा होगा। क्योंकि उसमें  तुरंत समझ आता है, इसलिए मैं खेल जगत का उदहारण देता हूँ। ज़्यादातर सफल  खिलाड़ियों के जीवन की एक विशेषता है कि वो अनुस्पर्द्धा करते हैं। अगर हम  श्रीमान सचिन तेंदुलकर जी का ही उदहारण ले लें। बीस साल लगातार अपने ही  record तोड़ते जाना, खुद को ही हर बार पराजित करना और आगे बढ़ना। बड़ी अदभुत  जीवन यात्रा है उनकी, क्योंकि उन्होंने प्रतिस्पर्द्धा से ज्यादा  अनुस्पर्द्धा का रास्ता अपनाया। 

जीवन के हर क्षेत्र में दोस्तो और जब आप exam देने जा रहे हैं  तब, पहले अगर दो घंटे पढ़ पाते थे शान्ति से, वो तीन घंटे कर पाते हो क्या?  पहले जितने बजे सुबह उठना तय करते थे, देर हो जाती थी, क्या अब समय पर उठ  पाते हो क्या? पहले परीक्षा की tension में नींद नहीं आती थी, अब नींद आती  है क्या? ख़ुद को ही आप कसौटी पर कस लीजिए और आपको ध्यान में आएगा -  प्रतिस्पर्द्धा में पराजय, हताशा, निराशा और ईर्ष्या को जन्म देती है,  लेकिन अनुस्पर्द्धा आत्मंथन, आत्मचिंतन का कारण बनती है, संकल्प शक्ति को  दृढ़ बनाती है और जब ख़ुद को पराजित करते हैं, तो और अधिक आगे बढ़ने का उत्साह  अपने-आप पैदा होता है, बाहर से कोई extra energy की ज़रूरत नहीं पड़ती है।  भीतर से ही वो ऊर्जा अपने-आप पैदा होती है। अगर सरल भाषा में मुझे कहना है,  तो मैं कहूँगा - जब आप किसी से प्रतिस्पर्द्धा करते हैं, तो तीन  संभावनायें मोटी-मोटी नज़र आती हैं। एक, आप उससे बहुत बेहतर हैं। दूसरा, आप  उससे बहुत ख़राब हैं या आप उसके बराबर के हैं। अगर आप बेहतर हैं तो बेपरवाह  हो जाएँगे, अति विश्वास से भर जाएँगे। अगर आप उसके मुक़ाबले ख़राब करते हैं,  तब दुखी और निराश हो जाएँगे, ईर्ष्या से भर जाएँगे, जो ईर्ष्या आपको,  अपने-आप को, खाती जाएगी और अगर बराबरी के हैं, तो सुधार की आवश्यकता आप कभी  महसूस ही नहीं करोगे। जैसी गाड़ी चलती है, चलते रहोगे। तो मेरा आपसे आग्रह  है - अनुस्पर्द्धा का, ख़ुद से स्पर्द्धा करने का। पहले क्या किया था, उससे  आगे कैसे करूँगा, अच्छा कैसे करूँगा। बस, इसी पर ध्यान केंद्रित कीजिए। आप  देखिए, आपको बहुत परिवर्तन महसूस होगा। 

श्रीमान एस. सुन्दर जी ने अभिभावकों की भूमिका के संबंध में अपनी  भावना व्यक्त की है। उनका कहना है कि परीक्षा में अभिभावकों की भूमिका बहुत  ही महत्वपूर्ण होती है। उन्होंने आगे लिखा है – “मेरी माँ पढ़ी-लिखी नहीं  थी, फिर भी वह मेरे पास बैठा करती थी और मुझसे गणित के सवाल हल करने के  लिये कहती थी। वह उत्तर मिलाती और इस तरह से वो मेरी मदद करती थी। ग़लतियाँ  ठीक करती थी। मेरी माँ ने दसवीं की परीक्षा pass नहीं की, लेकिन बिना उनके  सहयोग के मेरे लिये C.B.S.E. के exam pass करना नामुमकिन था।” 

सुन्दर जी, आपकी बात सही है और आज भी देखा होगा आपने, मुझे सवाल  पूछने वाले, सुझाव देने वालों में महिलाओं की संख्या ज़्यादा है, क्योंकि घर  में बालकों के भविष्य के संबंध में मातायें जो सजग होती हैं, सक्रिय होती  हैं, वे बहुत चीज़ें सरल कर देती हैं। मैं अभिभावकों से इतना ही कहना  चाहूँगा - तीन बातों पर हम बल दें। स्वीकारना, सिखाना, समय देना। जो है,  उसे accept कीजिए। आपके पास जितनी क्षमता है, आप mentor कीजिए, आप कितने ही  व्यस्त क्यों न हों, समय निकालिए, time दीजिए। एक बार आप accept करना सीख  लेंगे, अधिकतम समस्या तो वही समाप्त हो जाएगी। हर अभिभावक इस बात को अनुभव  करता होगा, अभिभावकों का, टीचरों का expectation समस्या की जड़ में होता है।  acceptance समस्याओं के समाधान का रास्ता खोलता है। अपेक्षायें राह कठिन  कर देती हैं। अवस्था को स्वीकार करना, नए रास्ते खोलने का अवसर देती है और  इसलिए जो है, उसे accept कीजिए। आप भी बोझमुक्त हो जाएँगे। हम लोग, छोटे  बच्चों के school bag के वज़न की चर्चा करते रहते हैं, लेकिन कभी-कभी तो  मुझे लगता है कि अभिभावकों की जो अपेक्षायें होती हैं, उम्मीदें  होती हैं,  वो बच्चे के school bag से भी ज़रा ज़्यादा भारी हो जाती हैं। 

बहुत साल पहले की बात है। हमारे एक परिचित व्यक्ति heart attack के  कारण अस्पताल में थे, तो हमारे भारत के लोक सभा के पहले Speaker गणेश दादा  मावलंकर, उनके पुत्र पुरुषोत्तम मावलंकर, वो कभी M.P. भी रहे थे, वो उनकी  तबीयत देखने आए। मैं उस समय मौजूद था और मैंने देखा कि उन्होंने आ करके  उनकी तबीयत के संबंध में एक भी सवाल नहीं पूछा। बैठे और आते ही उन्होंने  वहाँ क्या स्थिति है, बीमारी कैसी है, कोई बातें नहीं, चुटकुले सुनाना शुरू  कर दिया और पहले दो-चार मिनट में ही ऐसा माहौल उन्होंने हल्का-फुल्का कर  दिया। एक प्रकार से बीमार व्यक्ति को जाकर के जैसे हम बीमारी से डरा देते  हैं। अभिभावकों से मैं कहना चाहूँगा, कभी-कभी हम भी बच्चों के साथ ऐसा ही  करते हैं। क्या आपको कभी लगा कि exam के दिनों में बच्चों को हँसी-ख़ुशी का  भी कोई माहौल दें। आप देखिए, वातावरण बदल जाएगा। 

एक बड़ा कमाल का मुझे phone call आया है। वे सज्जन अपना नाम बताना  नहीं चाहते हैं। phone सुन कर के आपको पता चलेगा कि वो अपना नाम क्यों नहीं  बताना चाहते हैं? 

“नमस्कार, प्रधानमंत्री जी, मैं अपना नाम तो नहीं बता सकता,  क्योंकि मैंने काम ही कुछ ऐसा किया था अपने बचपन में। मैंने बचपन में एक  बार नक़ल करने की कोशिश की थी, उसके लिये मैंने बहुत तैयारी करना शुरू किया  कि मैं कैसे नक़ल कर सकता हूँ, उसके तरीक़ों को ढूँढ़ने की कोशिश की, जिसकी  वजह से मेरा बहुत सारा time बर्बाद हो गया। उस time में मैं पढ़ करके भी  उतने ही नंबर ला सकता था, जितना मैंने नक़ल करने के लिए दिमाग लगाने में  ख़र्च किया। और जब मैंने नक़ल करके पास होने की कोशिश की, तो मैं उसमें पकड़ा  भी गया और मेरी वजह से मेरे आस-पास के कई दोस्तों को काफ़ी परेशानी हुई।”          

आपकी बात सही है। ये जो short-cut वाले रास्ते होते हैं, वो नक़ल  करने के लिये कारण बन जाते हैं। कभी-कभार ख़ुद पर विश्वास नहीं होने के कारण  मन करता है कि बगल वाले से ज़रा देख लूँ, confirm कर लूँ, मैंने जो लिखा  है, सही है कि नहीं है और कभी-कभी तो हमने सही लिखा होता है, लेकिन बगल  वाले ने झूठा लिखा होता है, तो उसी झूठ को हम कभी स्वीकार कर लेते हैं और  हम भी मर जाते हैं। तो नक़ल कभी फ़ायदा नहीं करती है। ‘To cheat।s to be  cheap, so please, do not cheat’। नक़ल आपको बुरा बनाती है, इसलिये नक़ल न  करें। आपने कई बार और बार-बार ये सुना होगा कि नक़ल मत करना, नक़ल मत करना।  मैं भी आपको वही बात दोबारा कह रहा हूँ। नक़ल को आप हर रूप में देख लीजिए,  वो जीवन को विफल बनाने के रास्ते की ओर आपको घसीट के ले जा रही है और exam  में ही अगर निरीक्षक ने पकड़ लिया, तो आपका तो सब-कुछ बर्बाद हो जाएगा और  मान लीजिए, किसी ने नहीं पकड़ा, तो जीवन पर आपके मन पर एक बोझ तो रहेगा कि  आपने ऐसा किया था और जब कभी आपको अपने बच्चों को समझाना होगा, तो आप आँख  में आँख मिला कर के नहीं समझा पाओगे। और एक बार नक़ल की आदत लग गई, तो जीवन  में कभी कुछ सीखने की इच्छा ही नहीं रहेगी। फिर तो आप कहाँ पहुँच पाओगे? 

मान लीजिए, आप भी अपने रास्तों को गड्ढे में परिवर्तित कर रहे हो  और मैंने तो देखा है, कुछ लोग ऐसे होते हैं कि नक़ल के तौर-तरीक़े ढूँढ़ने में  इतनी talent का उपयोग कर देते हैं, इतना Investment कर देते हैं; अपनी  पूरी creativity जो है, वो नक़ल करने के तौर-तरीक़ों में खपा देते हैं। अगर  वही creativity, यही time आप अपने exam के मुद्दों पर देते, तो शायद नक़ल की  ही ज़रुरत नहीं पड़ती। अपनी ख़ुद की मेहनत से जो परिणाम प्राप्त होगा, उससे  जो आत्मविश्वास बढ़ेगा, वो अद्भुत होगा। 

एक phone call आया है: - 

“नमस्कार, प्रधानमंत्री जी। My name is Monica and since I am a   class  12th student, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions regarding  the Board Exams. My first question is, what can we do to reduce the  stress that builds up during our exams and my second question is, why  exams all about work and no play are. Thank you.” 

अगर परीक्षा के दिनों में, मैं आपको खेल-कूद की बात करूँगा, तो  आपके teacher, आपके parents ये मुझ पर गुस्सा करेंगे, वो नाराज़ हो जाएँगे  कि ये कैसा प्रधानमंत्री है, बच्चों को exam के समय में कह रहा है, खेलो।  क्योंकि आम तौर पर धारणा ऐसी है कि अगर विद्यार्थी खेल-कूद में ध्यान देते  हैं, तो शिक्षा से बेध्यान हो जाते हैं। ये मूलभूत धारणा ही ग़लत है, समस्या  की जड़ वो ही है। सर्वांगीण विकास करना है, तो किताबों के बाहर भी एक  ज़िन्दगी होती है और वो बहुत बड़ी विशाल होती है। उसको भी जीने का सीखने का  यही समय होता है। कोई ये कहे कि मैं पहले सारी परीक्षायें पूर्ण कर लूँ,  बाद में खेलूँगा, बाद में ये करूँगा, तो असंभव है। जीवन का यही तो moulding  का time होता है। इसी को तो परवरिश कहते हैं। दरअसल परीक्षा में मेरी  दृष्टि से तीन बातें बहुत ज़रुरी हैं – proper rest आराम, दूसरा जितनी  आवश्यक है शरीर के लिये, उतनी नींद और तीसरा दिमागी activity के सिवाय भी  शरीर एक बहुत बड़ा हिस्सा है। तो शरीर के बाकी हिस्सों को भी physical  activity मिलनी चाहिए। क्या कभी सोचा है कि जब इतना सारा सामने हो, तो दो  पल बाहर निकल कर ज़रा आसमान में देखें, ज़रा पेड़-पौधों की तरफ देखें, थोड़ा-सा  मन को हल्का करें, आप देखिए, एक ताज़गी के साथ फिर से आप अपने कमरे में,  अपनी किताबों के बीच आएँगे। आप जो भी कर रहे हों, थोड़ा break लीजिए, उठ  करके बाहर जाइए, kitchen में जाइए, अपनी पसंद की कोई चीज़ है, ज़रा खोजिए,  अपनी पसंद का biscuit मिल जाए, तो खाइए, थोड़ी हँसी-मज़ाक कर लीजिए। भले पांच  मिनट क्यों न हो, लेकिन आप break दीजिए। आपको महसूस होगा कि आपका काम सरल  होता जा रहा है। सबको ये पसंद है कि नहीं, मुझे मालूम नहीं, लेकिन मेरा तो  अनुभव है। ऐसे समय deep breathing करते हैं, तो बहुत फ़ायदा होता है। गहरी  साँस आप देखिए बहुत relax हो जाता है। गहरी साँस भी लेने के लिये कोई कमरे  में fit रहने की ज़रुरत नहीं है। ज़रा खुले आसमान के नीचे आएँ, छत पर चले  जाएँ, पांच मिनट गहरी साँस ले करके फिर अपने पढ़ने के लिए बैठ जाएँ, आप  देखिए, शरीर एक दम से relax हो जाएगा और शरीर का जो  relaxation आप अनुभव  करते हैं न, वो दिमागी अंगों का भी उतना ही relaxation कर देता है। कुछ  लोगों को लगता है, रात को देर-देर जागेंगे, ज़्यादा-ज़्यादा पढ़ेंगे - जी  नहीं, शरीर को जितनी नींद की आवश्यकता है, वो अवश्य लीजिए, उससे आपका पढ़ने  का समय बर्बाद नहीं होगा, वो पढ़ने की ताक़त में इज़ाफ़ा करेगा। आपका  concentration बढ़ेगा, आपकी ताज़गी आएगी, freshness होगा। आपकी efficiency  में overall बहुत बड़ी बढ़ोतरी होगी। मैं जब चुनाव में सभायें करता हूँ, तो  कभी-कभी मेरी आवाज़ बैठ जाती है। तो मुझे एक लोक गायक मिलने आए। उन्होंने  मुझे आकर के पूछा - आप कितने घंटे सोते हैं। मैंने कहा - क्यों भाई, आप  डॉक्टर हैं क्या? नहीं-नहीं, बोले - ये आपका आवाज़ जो चुनाव के समय भाषण  करते-करते ख़राब हो जाता है, उसका इसके साथ संबंध है। आप पूरी नींद लेंगे,  तभी आपके vocal cord को पूरा rest मिलेगा। अब मैंने नींद को और मेरे भाषण  को और मेरी आवाज़ को कभी सोचा ही नहीं था, उन्होंने मुझे एक जड़ी-बूटी दे दी।  तो सचमुच में हम इन चीज़ों का महत्व समझें, आप देखिए, आपको फ़ायदा होगा।  लेकिन इसका मतलब ये नहीं कि बस सोते ही रहें, लेकिन कुछ कहेंगे कि  प्रधानमंत्री जी ने कह दिया है, अब बस जागने की ज़रुरत नहीं है, सोते रहना  है। तो ऐसा मत करना, वरना आपके परिवार के लोग मेरे से नाराज़ हो जाएँगे। और  आपकी अगर marks-sheet जिस दिन आएगी, तो उनको आप नहीं दिखाई दोगे, मैं ही  दिखाई दूँगा। तो ऐसा मत करना। और इसलिये मैं तो कहूँगा ‘P for prepared and  P for play’, जो खेले वो खिले, ‘the person who plays, shines’. मन,  बुद्धि, शरीर उसको सचेत रखने के लिये ये एक बहुत बड़ी औषधि है। 

ख़ैर, युवा दोस्तो, आप परीक्षा की तैयारी में हैं और मैं आपको मन की  बातों में जकड़ कर बैठा हूँ। हो सकता है, ये आज की मेरी बातें भी तो आपके  लिये relaxation का तो काम करेंगी ही करेंगी। लेकिन मैं साथ-साथ ये भी  कहूँगा, मैंने जो बातें बताई हैं, उसको भी बोझ मत बनने दीजिए। हो सकता है  तो करिए, नहीं हो सकता तो मत कीजिए, वरना ये भी एक बोझ बन जाएगा। तो जैसे  मैं आपके परिवार के माता-पिता को बोझ न बनने देने की सलाह देता हूँ, वो मुझ  पर भी लागू होती हैं। अपने संकल्प को याद करते हुए, अपने पर विश्वास रखते  हुए, परीक्षा के लिये जाइए, मेरी बहुत शुभकामनायें हैं । हर कसौटी से पार  उतरने के लिये कसौटी को उत्सव बना दीजिए। फिर कभी कसौटी, कसौटी ही नहीं  रहेगी। इस मंत्र को ले करके आगे बढ़ें।  

प्यारे देशवासियो, 1 फरवरी 2017 Indian Coast Guard के 40 वर्ष  पूरे हो रहे हैं। इस अवसर पर मैं Coast Guard के सभी अधिकारियों एवं जवानों  को राष्ट्र के प्रति उनकी सेवा के लिये धन्यवाद देता हूँ। ये गर्व की बात  है कि Coast Guard देश में निर्मित अपने सभी 126 ships और 62  aircrafts के  साथ विश्व के 4 सबसे बड़े Coast Guard के बीच अपना स्थान बनाए हुए है।  Coast Guard का मंत्र है ‘वयम् रक्षामः’। अपने इस आदर्श वाक्य को चरितार्थ  करते हुए, देश की समुद्री सीमाओं और समुद्री परिवेश को सुरक्षित करने के  लिये Coast Guard के जवान प्रतिकूल परिस्थितियों में भी दिन-रात तत्पर रहते  हैं। पिछले वर्ष Coast Guard के लोगों ने अपनी जिम्मेवारियों के साथ-साथ  हमारे देश के समुद्र तट को स्वच्छ बनाने का बड़ा अभियान उठाया था और हज़ारों  लोग इसमें शरीक़ हुए थे। Coastal Security के साथ-साथ Coastal Cleanness  इसकी भी चिंता की उन्होंने, ये सचमुच में बधाई के पात्र हैं। और बहुत कम  लोगों को मालूम होगा कि हमारे देश में Coast Guard में सिर्फ़ पुरुष नहीं  हैं, महिलायें भी कन्धे से कन्धा मिला कर समान रूप से अपनी जिम्मेवारियाँ  निभा रहीं हैं और सफलतापूर्वक निभा रहीं हैं। Coast Guard की हमारी महिला  अफ़सर Pilot हों, Observers के रूप में काम हों, इतना ही नहीं, Hovercraft  की कमान भी संभालती हैं। भारत के तटीय सुरक्षा में लगे हुए और सामुद्रिक  सुरक्षा एक महत्वपूर्ण विषय आज विश्व का बना हुआ है, तब मैं Indian Coast  Guard के 40वीं वर्षगांठ पर उनको बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूँ।  

1 फरवरी को वसन्त पंचमी का त्यौहार है, वसन्त - ये सर्वश्रेष्ठ ऋतु  के रूप में, उसको स्वीकृति मिली हुई है। वसन्त - ये ऋतुओं का राजा है।  हमारे देश में वसन्त पंचमी सरस्वती पूजा का एक बहुत बड़ा त्योहार होता है।  विद्या की आराधना का अवसर माना जाता है। इतना ही नहीं, वीरों के लिए  प्रेरणा का भी पर्व होता है। ‘मेरा रंग दे बसंती चोला’ - ये वही तो प्रेरणा  है। इस वसन्त पंचमी के पावन त्योहार पर मेरी देशवासियों को बहुत-बहुत  शुभकामनायें हैं।  

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, ‘मन की बात’ में आकाशवाणी भी अपनी कल्पकता  के साथ हमेशा नये रंग-रूप भरता रहता है। पिछले महीने से उन्होंने मेरी ‘मन  की बात’ पूर्ण होने के तुरंत बाद प्रादेशिक भाषाओं में ‘मन की बात’ सुनाना  शुरू किया है। इसको व्यापक स्वीकृति मिली है। दूर-दूर से लोग चिट्ठियाँ  लिख रहे हैं। मैं आकाशवाणी को उनके इस स्वयं प्रेरणा से किए गए काम के लिये  बहुत-बहुत अभिनन्दन करता हूँ। देशवासियो, में आपका भी बहुत अभिनन्दन करता  हूँ। ‘मन की बात’ मुझे आपसे जुड़ने का एक बहुत बड़ा अवसर देती है। बहुत-बहुत  शुभकामनायें। धन्यवाद।

                Young friends, on the pious occasion of Republic Day the nation and world has experienced and witnessed our devotion and dedication for democracy, commitment for the unity of India and feeling of strength of unity in diversity through you, i.e. the NCC cadets who have come from different corners of our country. My heartfelt congratulations to you all and hope that as a good citizen you will be committed even in personal, public and routine life for those highest parameters of humanity in future which can become a mark of uniqueness for India in the world. 

The life of NCC cadet is beyond uniform, the parade and the camps. Through NCC germinates a sense of mission. The NCC days helps in creating a purpose for life, its value more specifically the group culture. In addition to routine educational curriculum the experience gained in NCC offers a glimpse of great India, its strength, inherent energy and its diversity as well. The rest of world wonders that what kind of country India having more than 1500 dialects, plus 100 languages and change of dialect after every 20 kos, different dresses and food habits? Still tied in one rope. And if Himalaya gets wounded, tears erupt in Kanyakumari. This is the feeling of national integration. A happy moment in any part of India gives a sense of proudness to citizens dwelling in other part. Likewise we are pained if something happens bad in any part of country or on something done wrong by anyone in India or elsewhere. The country has unitedly shared the pain and feelings of any disaster in any part of the country. Any challenge ahead the nation has been met by our 125 crore people as it is their problem and has tried to accomplish the task with hard work and valour. 

This is our own strength. The emperors, rulers, government do not make a nation, but a nation is built by its citizens, the common man, teachers, farmers, labourers, scientists, learned persons, scholars and saints. This is an unhindered penance that gets transformed into a nation. We are fortunate for being part of this thousands of years old live heritage and having a chance of chipping in to some extent for the building up process. And it is the NCC that proves us the values needed for holding and bearing that responsibility. 

I was also fortunate in getting this sense of mission as an NCC cadet in my school days. I was not as talented as you are, was not a bright cadet as you are so never got selected for Delhi parade. Though, looking at you makes me proud that your strength, feelings and experience is far better than my strength. So I am sure that you and this young strength is more capable than me in leaps and bounds. It gives a sense of security for future. 

NCC and its cadets have owned and furthered the cleanliness campaign in the country and have accomplished it successfully wherever they had an opportunity. An organisation having more than 13 lakh cadets are capable of running and inspiring the cleanliness operations. But as a citizen a cadet itself can act as a catalyst in and around his family and society for cleanliness. However a lot of things are needed to make it a habit and point of motivation for the society for generating hatred towards dirtiness, love for cleanliness and a collective responsibility especially during 2019 while observing 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Being in large numbers and residing across the country, the NCC cadets are trained and instilled with energy, courage and zeal and can further this movement as a biggest strength. 

The young mind, especially the Indian mind readily adopts technology. It will be a dividend for any country to have Aadhar Card Number with Biometric Identification for every citizen above 18 years. And India do have this. This specific identification can be the base of all our schemes. 

A campaign to motivate people for adopting Digital Currency in our country is in progress now a days. NCC cadets have furthered it. Billions of Rupees are spent on the printing and availability of currency notes up to the villages. For each and every ATM at least 5 police persons are deputed. Going digital will save a huge amount of money and that can be used in providing house, education, medicine to the deprived poor masses and good values to the children of poor. A habit of Digital payment by country will arrange that money without any constraint on our coffers and pockets. 

So download the BHIM App on your mobile while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar and cultivate a habit of transaction with others, within our family and with the shopkeeper from where we procures our daily need items. You can’t imagine the great service done this way and every Indian national is capable of doing that. 

In a technology driven society when the time and systems are undergoing changes, India cannot lag behind anyway in the world. Our 65 percent population of under 35 years of age as a Demographic Dividend is capable of dealing with the rest of world with bold face and if our 800 million young population takes a resolve to usher in for a big change in economy than the work done will be much more than done by the Prime Minister or the Finance Minister. Now NCC has taken this onus and I hope that it will be accomplished. 

NCC cadets are infused with patriotism and unique Discipline. Collective Action is their habit. Moving together, joining shoulders, thinking together, taking thoughtful action and achieving the target are their speciality. Today when the world is confronting with terrorism, our young generation have to strive for compassion for society and nation. A phrase is there- “Rashtram Jagryam vayam”, Nirantar Jagruk. For this one has to remain alert and to ensure that any young one in our vicinity is not treading the wrong track and not getting trapped in unlawful acts that are bound to ruin him and his family making him a burden for society. He should be diverted from all such situations. If we are awaken and alert, then we guide our neighbourhood and fellow citizen and extend our vision and mission to all , be they are in NCC or not and can follow our theory as well as thoughts. 

Today in the Republic Day parade you have grasped many things and have found new friends. After getting a unique opportunity of understanding of vast canvas of India you will be back home with very sweet memories. Your friends at home, schools and colleges will be waiting for your arrival and will be eager to know your experiences. You might have forwarded and shared your on the spot parade snapshots from your mobiles to them. And your friends had also viewed the parade seriously just to have your specific presence. You were being watched across the country. This not a small laurel. It’s a moment of immense pleasure. Your return journey is full of such valuable memories and never allow to get this faded and scattered away. Tender and cultivate it for ever. Grooming of good habits leads to colourful life. Its fragrance will be lifelong and will bloom your surroundings also. 

My best heartfelt wishes to all of you. I congratulates to all those cadets who have been awarded. My best wishes to NCC. Many-Many thanks.

                देश के कोने-कोने से आए हुए सभी युवा साथि‍यों, 

गणतंत्र के पावन पर्व पर देश के कोने-कोने से आए हुए NCC के Cadets ने लोकतंत्र के प्रति‍ अपनी श्रद्धा, भारत की एकता के प्रति‍ हमारी प्रति‍बद्धता, वि‍वि‍धता में एकता के सामर्थ्‍य की अनुभूति‍, देश और दुनि‍या ने आपके माध्‍यम से महसूस की है। मैं आपसब को हृदय से बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं और भारत के उत्‍तम नागरि‍क के नाते, आने वाले कालखंड में भी आप अपने व्‍यक्‍ति‍गत जीवन में भी, सामान्‍य जीवन में भी, राष्‍ट्र जीवन में भी और मानवता के उच्‍च आदर्शों के प्रति‍ भी वैसी ही प्रति‍बद्धता, वैसी ही समर्पण की मि‍साल कायम करते रहेंगे। जो भारत की वि‍श्‍व में एक अनोखी पहचान बनाने का कारण बन सकती है। 

NCC के Cadet के रूप में सि‍र्फ यूनि‍फॉर्म नहीं होती है, सि‍र्फ परेड नहीं होती, सि‍र्फ कैम्‍प नहीं होते हैं, NCC के माध्‍यम से एक sense of mission का बीजारोपण होता है। हमारे भीतर एक जीवन जीने का मकसद उसके संस्‍कार का और वो भी सामूहि‍क संस्‍कार का ये कालखंड होता है। NCC के कारण अपनी शि‍क्षा-दीक्षा के अलावा, भारत की वि‍वि‍धता के, भारत की अंतर-ऊर्जा के, भारत के वि‍राट सामर्थ्‍य के हमें दर्शन होते हैं। दुनि‍या के लोगों को आश्‍चर्य होता है कि‍ ये कैसा देश है, 1500 से ज्‍यादा बोलि‍यां हों, 100 से ज्‍यादा भाषाएं हों, हर 20 कोस के बाद बोली बदलती हों, वेशभूषा अलग हों, खानपान अलग हों, उसके बावजूद भी एकता के सूत्र से बंधे हुए रहते हैं और चोट हि‍मालय में आएं, आंसू कन्‍याकुमारी में टपक करके नि‍कल आते हैं। ये भाव, राष्‍ट्रीय एकात्‍मकता का भाव। भारत के कि‍सी भी कोने में अच्‍छा हो और देशवासी खुशी से फूला नहीं समाता और भारत के कि‍सी भी कोने में या भारतीय के द्वारा कहीं पर भी कुछ गलत हो जाएं तो हमें उतनी ही पीड़ा होती है जैसे हमारे सामने कोई घटना घटी हैं। देश के कि‍सी भी कोने में प्राकृति‍क आपदा आईं हों, देश ने एकता के रूप में उस संवेदना को साझा कि‍या है, दर्द बांटने का प्रयास कि‍या है। देश के सामने कोई चुनौती आई हो तो सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासि‍यों ने उस चुनौती को अपना माना है। अपने पुरुषार्थ से और पराक्रम से उसे परि‍पूर्ण करने का भरसक प्रयास कि‍या है। 

ये हमारे देश की अपनी ताकत हैं। कोई देश राजा-महाराजाओं से नहीं बनते हैं। देश शासकों से नहीं बनते हैं। देश सरकारों से नहीं बनते हैं। देश बनते हैं सामान्‍य नागरि‍कों से, शि‍क्षकों से, कि‍सान से, मजदूर से, वैज्ञानि‍कों से, ज्ञानि‍यों से, आचार्यों से, भगवंतों से। एक अखंड तपस्‍या होती हैं जो राष्‍ट्र का ये वि‍राट रूप अर्जि‍त करती है और हम भाग्‍यवान लोग है कि‍ हजारों साल की इस महान वि‍रासत के हम भी एक जीवंत अंश है और हमारे जि‍म्‍मे भी उसमें कुछ न कुछ जोड़ने का दायि‍त्‍व आया है। उस दायि‍त्‍व को नि‍भाने के लि‍ए जो संस्‍कार चाहि‍ए, जो training चाहि‍ए, जो अनुभव चाहि‍ए वो NCC के माध्‍यम से हमें प्राप्‍त हुआ है। 

मेरा भी सौभाग्‍य रहा है। बचपन में NCC के Cadet के रूप में ये sense of mission, ये अनुभूति‍ इसकी समझ वि‍कसि‍त हुई। मैं आप जैसा होनहार नहीं था, उतना तेजस्‍वी Cadet नहीं था और इसलि‍ए दि‍ल्‍ली की परेड में कभी मेरा selection नहीं हुआ। लेकि‍न आपको देखकर के मुझे गर्व होता है कि‍ बचपन में मेरे पास जो शक्‍ति‍ थी, अनुभूति‍ थी, अनुभव था उससे आप कई गुना आगे हो, ये देखकर के मुझे और खुशी होती है। इसलि‍ए ये भी भरोसा बैठता है कि‍ आपमें आगे जाने का सामर्थ्‍य भी मुझसे कई गुना ज्‍यादा है। ये युवा शक्‍ति‍ में देश को आगे ले जाने का भी सामर्थ्‍य मुझसे भी कई गुना ज्‍यादा है और तब जाकर के देश के उज्‍ज्‍वल भवि‍ष्‍य के लि‍ए आश्‍वस्‍त हो जाते हैं, नि‍श्‍चि‍न्‍त हो जाते हैं। 

NCC ने, उसके Cadets ने स्‍वच्‍छता के अभि‍यान को अपना बना लि‍या। देश में जहां भी जाने का अवसर मि‍ला NCC के द्वारा योजनापूर्वक स्‍वच्‍छता के अभि‍यान को चलाया गया है। जि‍स संगठन के पास 13 लाख से ज्‍यादा Cadets हो, वो Cadets स्‍वयं organized way में स्‍वच्‍छता का अभि‍यान चलाएं, औरों को प्रेरणा देते हैं। लेकि‍न एक नागरि‍क के रूप में, स्‍वयं के जीवन में, अपने परि‍वार के जीवन में, अपने आस-पास के परि‍सर में, अपने दोस्‍तों में, दोस्‍तों के परि‍वारों में; स्‍वच्‍छता, ये स्‍वभाव बने उसमें catalytic agent के रूप में NCC का हर Cadet काम कर सकता है। NCC की व्‍यवस्‍था के तहत स्‍वच्‍छता एक प्रेरक है लेकि‍न एक Cadet नागरि‍क के रूप में समाज में स्‍वच्‍छता को स्‍वभाव बनाने के लि‍ए, भारत का स्‍वच्‍छता एक चरि‍त्र बन जाए, और 2019 में महात्‍मा गांधी की 150वीं जयंती जब मनाएं तब देश में गंदगी के प्रति‍ भरपूर नफरत हो, स्‍वच्‍छता के प्रति‍ प्रेम हो, स्‍वच्‍छता हर व्‍यक्‍ति‍ के जीवन की अपनी जि‍म्‍मेवारी बन जाएं, उस बात को आगे बढ़ाने के लि‍ए हर कि‍सी को बहुत कुछ करने की आवश्‍यकता है। NCC के Cadet इतनी बड़ी तादाद में है और देश के हर कोने-कोने में फैले हुए नौजवान है, ऊर्जा है, उमंग है, उत्‍साह है, training है, वो तो शायद सबसे बड़ी ताकत के रूप में इस स्‍वच्‍छता के आंदोलन को आगे बढ़ा सकते हैं। 

युवा मन और वैसे भी भारतीय मन technology को बहुत जल्‍दी adopt कर लेता है। इस देश के अंदर 18 उम्र से ऊपर के करीब-करीब सभी नागरि‍कों का ‘आधार’ कार्ड हो, ‘आधार’ नंबर हो, बायोमेट्रि‍क से उसकी पहचान हो, ये कि‍सी भी देश की बहुत बड़ी संपत्‍ति‍ है जो आज भारत के पास है। ये वि‍शि‍ष्‍ट पहचान हमारी सब योजनाओं का आधार बन सकती है। 

इन दि‍नों लोग Digital Currency की ओर कैसे जाएं, उसका एक अभि‍यान चल रहा है। NCC के Cadets ने उसको आगे बढ़ाया है। नोट, नोट की छपाई, छपाई करने के बाद नोट को गांव-गांव पहुंचाना, अरबों रुपयों का खर्च होता है। एक–एक ATM को संभालने के लि‍ए पांच-पांच पुलि‍स वाले लगते हैं। अगर हम डि‍जि‍टल की ओर चले जाएं तो देश के कि‍तने पैसे बचा सकते हैं और वो पैसे गरीब को घर देने के लि‍ए, गरीब को शि‍क्षा देने के लि‍ए, गरीब को दवाई देने के लि‍ए, गरीब के बच्‍चों को अच्‍छे संस्‍कार देने के लि‍ए वो धन काम में आ सकता है। हमारी जेब से कुछ भी दि‍ए बि‍ना, खुद की पॉकेट से कोई अलग खर्चा कि‍ए बि‍ना, अगर हम देश में Digital Payment की आदत डाल दें। 

BHIM app, बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडकर का स्‍मरण करते हुए BHIM app अपने मोबाइल फोन पर डाउनलोड करे और BHIM app से लोगों को कारोबार करने की आदत डालें, अपने परि‍वार के हर व्‍यक्‍ति‍ को आदत डालें, जहां से हम खरीद-बि‍क्री करते हैं उस दुकानदार को आदत डालें, आपको कल्‍पना नहीं होगी, उतनी बड़ी सेवा देश को कर पाएंगे और हि‍न्‍दुस्‍तान का हर नागरि‍क इस काम को कर सकता है। 

बदलते हुए युग में बदलती हुई व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को और जब technology driven society है तब भारत वि‍श्‍व में कहीं पीछे नहीं रह सकता है। जि‍स देश के पास 65 प्रति‍शत जनसंख्‍या 35 साल से कम उम्र की हो, Demographic Dividend के नाम पर दुनि‍या में हम सीना तानकर के, आंख से आंख मि‍लाकर के बात करते हो, उस देश के 800 million youth अगर एक बार ठान लें कि‍ अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था में इतना बड़ा बदलाव लाने के लि‍ए हमें योगदान करना है, कोई कल्‍पना भी नहीं कर सकता है कि‍ प्रधानमंत्री से भी ज्‍यादा या वि‍त्‍तमंत्री से भी ज्‍यादा बहुत बड़ा काम हि‍न्‍दुस्‍तान का नौजवान कर सकता है। बदलाव ला सकता है। NCC ने भी इस जि‍म्‍मेवारी को उठाया है। मुझे वि‍श्‍वास है कि‍ वो इसे परि‍पूर्ण करते रहेंगे। 

NCC के Cadet देशभक्‍ति‍ से भरे हुए होते हैं। अनुशासन इनकी वि‍शेषता होती है। मि‍लकर के काम करना इनका स्‍वभाव होता है। कदम से कदम मि‍लाकर के चलना, कंधे से कंधा मि‍लाकर के चलना लेकि‍न साथ-साथ मि‍लकर के सोचना, सोचकर के चलना, चलकर के पाना, ये NCC की वि‍शेषता होती है। इसलि‍ए आज जब वि‍श्‍व आतंकवाद की चुनौती को झेल रहा है, तब हमारी युवा पीढ़ी में समाज के प्रति‍, देश के प्रति‍ अपनेपन का भाव नि‍रंतर जगाते रहना पड़ता है। हमारे यहां कहावत है, ‘राष्‍ट्रम जाग्रयाम व्‍यं’। नि‍रंतर जागरूक। इसके लि‍ए चौकन्‍ना रहना होता है। हमारे आस-पास का कोई नौजवान कहीं गलत रास्‍ते पर तो नहीं चल पड़ रहा है, उसको रोकना होगा। जीवन में कोई ऐसी बुराइयां तो नहीं आ रही हैं जो उसको तो तबाह करें, उसके पूरे परि‍वार को तबाह करें और समाज के लि‍ए वो बोझ बन जाएगा। अगर हम जागरुक होंगे तो अपने अगल-बगल के परि‍सर को, अपने साथि‍यों को भी, भले वो NCC में हों या न हों, हम उसे भी, जि‍स sense of mission को हमने पाया है, जि‍स जीवन के मकसद को हमने जाना है, उसको भी उसका प्रसार प्राप्‍त हो सकता है और वो भी हमारी राह पर चल सकता है। 

आज गणतंत्र की इस परेड में इतने दि‍न आप लोगों ने बहुत-सी चीजें सीखी हैं, बहुत से नए मि‍त्र पाएं हैं, भारत के कोने-कोने को जानने-समझने का अवसर मि‍ला है। बहुत ही उम्‍दा स्‍मृति‍यों के साथ आप अपने घर लौटने वाले हैं। आपके स्‍कूल-कॉलेज के students, आपके साथी इस बात का इंतजार करते हैं कि‍ आप कब पहुंचे और अपने अनुभव बताएं। आपने उनको अपनी फोटो भी मोबाइल फोन से भेज दी होगी, share कि‍या होगा कि‍ मैं परेड में यहां था और आपके साथि‍यों ने भी परेड को बड़ी बारीकी से देखा होगा कि‍ पूरी परेड दि‍खे या न दि‍खे, अपने गांव वाला लड़का दि‍खता है कि‍ नहीं दि‍खता है। अपने स्‍कूल वाला बच्‍चा दि‍खता है कि‍ नहीं दि‍खता है। पूरे हि‍न्‍दुस्तान के हर कोने में हरेक की नज़र आप पर थी। ये कोई छोटा गौरव नहीं है। ये कि‍तने बड़े आनंद का पल होता है। उन स्‍मृति‍यों को लेकर के जब आप लौट रहे हैं तब ये एक अनमोल खजाना आपके पास है। इसे कभी बि‍खरने मत देना, वि‍सरने मत देना, इसे संजोकर रखना और उसको पनपाने की कोशि‍श करना। ये अच्‍छी चीजें जि‍तनी पनपाएंगे, जीवन भी उतना खि‍ल उठेगा। वो पूरी की पूरी महक आपके जीवन के भीतर से प्रकट होती रहेगी जो आसपास के पूरे परि‍सर को पुलकि‍त करती रहेगी। 

मेरी आप सब को हृदय से बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं हैं। आज वि‍जयी हुए Cadets को भी हृदय से बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं, अभि‍नंदन करता हूं। NCC को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं, बहत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                Your Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan,

Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi,

Friends from the Media, 



It gives me great pleasure to welcome to India a dear friend, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan . We are delighted that His Highness has come back to India on his second State visit. And, with his participation as our honoured Chief Guest in the Republic Day Celebrations tomorrow this visit is particularly special. Your Highness, I warmly recall our earlier meetings in August 2015, and in February last year. Our discussions were wide ranging covering the entire spectrum of our bilateral engagement. Personally, I benefitted immensely from your perspective of our partnership, your appreciation of our region and your world view. Your Highness, under your leadership, we have been successful in creating new synergies in our ties. We have shaped an ambitious roadmap of engagement to make our comprehensive strategic partnership purposeful and action oriented. The agreement that was exchanged just now has institutionalized this understanding.


Friends, 

UAE is one of our most valued partners and a close friend in an important region of the world. I have just concluded very fruitful and productive discussions with His Highness. We particularly focused on implementation of various decisions taken during our last two meetings. We agreed to sustain the momentum of our relations in key areas, including energy and investments.


Friends, 

We regard UAE as an important partner in India’s growth story. I particularly welcome UAE’s interest in investing in India’s infrastructure sector. We are working to connect the institutional investors in UAE with our National Investment and Infrastructure Fund. I also shared with His Highness the interest of Indian companies to be a partner in infrastructure projects for the World EXPO 2020 in Dubai. UAE can benefit by linking with our growth in manufacturing and services. We can jointly tap abundant opportunities in our initiatives aimed at building digital economy, human capital and smart urbanization in India. We are also encouraging and facilitating business and industry of both countries to increase the quality and quantum bilateral trade. The agreement on trade remedies signed today would strengthen our trade partnership further. Our energy partnership, is an important bridge in our linkages. It contributes to our energy security. His Highness and I discussed ways to transform our energy ties in a strategic direction through specific projects and proposals. In this regard, long-term supply contracts and establishment of joint ventures in the energy sector can be beneficial avenues.

 

Friends, 

Security and defence cooperation have added growing new dimensions to our relationship. We have agreed to expand our useful cooperation in the field of defence to new areas including in the maritime domain. The MoU on Defence Cooperation, signed earlier today, will help steer our defence engagements in the right direction. We also feel that our growing engagement in countering violence and extremism is necessary for securing our societies.

Friends, 

His Highness and I believe that our closer ties are of importance, not just to both our countries. They are also of significance to the entire neighbourhood. Our convergence can help stabilize the region. And, our economic partnership can be a source of regional and global prosperity. We exchanged views on developments in West Asia and the Gulf, where both countries have a shared interest in peace and stability. We also discussed developments in our region, including Afghanistan. Our shared concern on growing threat from radicalism and terrorism to the safety and security of our people is shaping our cooperation in this space.


Friends, 

UAE is home to around 2.6 million Indians. Their contributions are deeply valued both in India and in UAE. I expressed gratitude to His Highness for looking after the welfare of Indian nationals in UAE. I also thanked His Highness for allotting land for a temple for the Indian diaspora in Abu Dhabi. 


Friends, 

The success of our partnership owes greatly to the personal interest taken by His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of UAE and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed. Moving forward, our cooperation stands poised for a major take off. I am confident, Your Highness, that your visit will build on the strong gains and understanding of our previous interactions. And, shape its future framework marked by depth, drive and diversification of our partnership. In closing, I would like to thank His Highness for accepting my invitation to visit India. I wish him and all the delegation members a very pleasant stay in India.


Thank you.  Thank you very much.

Thank You Chairman,
                                  

    I once  again sincerely thank      President Vladimir Putin for his hospitality  and good arrangements. He has      given us the opportunity to come and  see this new area.

 

    I heartily appreciate the      excellent leadership provided by President Rousseff to the BRICS in the  last year ;  BRICS touched a new high.  

 

    I heartily thank all my      friends from BRICS for their  contribution to making the International Yoga      Day on 21st June a global success.  The Yoga Day was celebrated in 193      countries and hundreds of cities.

 

    BRICS is an important pillar      of hope in the world; full of political security and economic challenges.

 

    BRICS works  not only for BRICS countries but also for      the welfare of the whole world, particularly developing countries.

 

    Our  discussions have been      meaningful and fruitful, we had detailed  discussion during the first      session and even during lunch.

 

    The challenges the world      is facing , those are  for  all the countries;      hence there is an urgent need for consensus,  collaboration and cooperation      among all major countries.  All of      you should follow international rules and norms.

 

    We are meeting on the      occasion of 70th  anniversary of United Nations. This year the      world has to take  major and strong decisions on development and climate      change.

 

    Whatever  the type of      challenges, whether they are economic, social or  political, we will be      more successful to resolve them provided we  complete the reforms in the United      Nations and its Security Council  in the given time frame.  If this world body wants to remain      relevant in 21st century, its reforms are a  must and this has to be done  urgently.  
    Peace and stability are      the foundations  of social and      economic development. We ourselves and the world is duty bound  to       effectively address the main security challenges of today;      terrorism and extremism.

 

    We  should fight against      them unitedly, without distinction between the  sponsors and targeted      countries. We should follow the same  practice in BRICS, United Nations and      its Security Council and  other committees.

 

    We should include poverty      eradication in the post 2015 main development agenda of United Nations. 

 

    The  successes in economic      field is commendable. These include New  Development Bank, the Contingency      Reserve Fund, Export Credit  Insurance, Financing for Innovation and new      proposal for customs  cooperation and Reinsurance pool.

 

    BRICS economic cooperation  strategy is a milestone      in the path of progress for BRICS. This  also includes many social      initiatives. I am glad that the India’s  proposal submitted at Fortalza has      been included in this. In our  restricted session on economic cooperation I      have given a  suggestion for cooperation between BRICS countries for BRICS      trade  fair. BRICS Railway Research Centre and Supreme Audit Institutions.

 

    Climate change is one of the  biggest challenges facing      the world. BRICS countries are required  to initiate a big program to make      renewable energy cheap and  available to all and also for developing energy      efficient  technologies. This is the way to adopt clean energy. I want that       the first big project on clean energy is funded by New Development Bank  and      it will be a very good idea if our five countries execute it  jointly.

 

    By the end of this year BRICS  countries are required      to establish better coordination between  them so that a meaningful and      ambitious agreement in Paris could be  reached. 

 

    We can think of BRICS digital  initiative, in which      our capabilities could be utilized as a new  development alternative for      the developing countries. With the use  of digital technology we can make      delivery of services in the area  of development more efficient. This apart financial inclusion and      empowerment could be increased.

 

    Last year, I spoke about  focussing our attention on      the youth. BRICS countries will also  have to focus their attention on      women empowerment initiatives in  their own countries as well as in the developing      world.

 
Excellences,
 

    We have discussed the issue of  migration. Keeping in      mind the demographic trends in the world  over, migrations could be a      source of strengthening global economy  and bringing balance into it . 

 

    On the other hand there are some humanitarian issues      that arise from wars and poverty. United Nations should give them  due consideration. 

 

    We welcome the initiative of  Russia for arranging the      first meeting of BRICS Heads of Migration  Services to establish BRICS      Standing Working Group on Migration.

 

    In the area of agriculture all of us  are equally strong  and in many areas we are on the first      place globally. I propose the setting up of  BRICS Agriculture Research Centre  which will be a great gift to the whole      world.

 

    Similarly we can think of making  such an      arrangement, in which we can invest in agricultural  infrastructure and      production in land rich countries and then send  the excess produce to the      deficit countries. This will be the  second  important step.

 

    Water shortage  is  a big challenge for future. In      developing countries the main  challenges are of availability of water, its      better use, arranging  drinking water. This is such an area in which  all  of us have good experience and      expertise. As such, we can bring in  a change in the scenario in our countries      as well as in other  countries. 

 

    I also propose to make a forum to  connect  our borders or states and local      governments with each other. They  can learn much more from each other.      Urbanization is a big  challenge, but it can be a big opportunity in coming      decades. We  can learn much more from each other by initiating a process of       conversation and cooperation among cities.

 

    Some of the BRICS members are  sports powerhouses. We      have to establish BRICS sports council,  under whose banner an annual BRICS      sports meet could be organized  in a particular game. As a beginning we can      organize football meet  in India next year. This is the game which is      popular in all BRICS  countries.

 

    To end, I once again congratulate  President Putin      for this successful summit. I believe, the  commitment and resolution that      is witnessed  among BRICS members      will take BRICS to a  new height. and      we will be able to contribute significantly to global welfare.

 

    Next year I will get the opportunity to welcome you      in India. I invite you all for next BRICS meeting in India.

 

    Before I finish my speech, I have a good topic for deliberation      in the next session;  we can think      of BRICS film festival. I have another suggestion that if we can start      film awards for BRICS,  I think, we      can promote it in a big way because while  film making can become a part of cultural      activity it can also become an avenue for knowing  each other. So, we can think over it. I      once again express my heartiest gratitude to president Putin and you all.

              
Thanks a lot.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today presented the National Bravery Awards to 25 children. 

Interacting with the awardees, the Prime Minister said their deeds of bravery show their decisiveness as much as their courage. He encouraged the children to ensure that this award does not become the end of their life’s purpose, and added that this award should only mark the beginning for them. 

Reminding the children about the significance of the day – 23rd January, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary – the Prime Minister urged the children to read as much as possible, and especially read biographies of leaders, sportspersons and other people who have done great deeds in their lives. 

He said that bravery is a state of mind; a healthy body helps, but the prime moving force is the mind. Therefore, he added, we need to make the mind strong. He urged the children to ensure that the adulation and fame that they are getting, should not become an obstacle to their future progress. 

The Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Gandhi, was present on the occasion. 

The National Bravery Award Scheme was initiated by the ICCW – Indian Council for Child Welfare – to give due recognition to the children who distinguish themselves by performing outstanding deeds of bravery and meritorious service and to inspire other children to emulate their examples.

Netaji Bose was a great intellectual who always thought about  the interests & wellbeing of the marginalised sections of society.  

Honoured that our Government got the opportunity to declassify  files relating to Netaji Bose & fulfil a popular demand pending for  decades.  

Files relating to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose are available on http://www.netajipapers.gov.in"", the Prime Minister said.

                Some of you may have come to Kutch for the first time and those who came here earlier, may not have thought of travelling thus far to this desert land close to the Pakistan border. However, today you got the chance to visit this place. Visiting desert will be a new experience for those who have come from the valleys of the Himalayas. People those who have spent their lifetime amid the greenery of the North East, the experience of visiting the desert will be new for them also and I am sure that this visit will leave a positive impact on this deliberation camp of yours.

It’s extremely important in the government that we sit together and understand our work and its roadmap. We need to evaluate the way the world is changing, where we stand in that changing world, where we want to reach and where we could reach. Unfortunately, the governments have developed a habit of working in the silos. At times there are silos within a department such that what is happening on one table is known to the people on other tables.

There is no coordination between different departments and because of this, if a department conceives a program another department conceives a diametrically opposite program. Surprisingly, sometimes two departments of the government fight a case in a court of law by paying the fees.  This is not a healthy situation and, it must be changed and the way to change it is to collectively sit together to discuss our role, the role our departments should play under a broad vision and what results we can produce, it would be better if we discuss all these things.  There are some departments that are like minded in nature despite being a separate entity. They have some understanding with each other.

Primarily people from four departments have come together here. In a way they have some relation with each other therefore it will be good if we share our experiences by sitting together. They should listen to the experts. We should try to understand how we have tried to find solutions to the difficulties faced by us, about the experiments conducted by us. In these three days, if you talk to each other freely during the breaks, at the time of having meals, while moving around and also in tents, may be it will for the first time for some to stay in a tent; may be some of you would be feeling hot but it gets cold after the sunset; there is a joy in living through these hardships; so after the sessions please share experiences of your states with your colleagues, please ask other states about their experiences. In a way it will be very valuable for us and we can use this thing in our policies, in our developmental journey.

There are certain things that we are required to do beyond the boundaries of our departments, beyond the scope of centre-states. Today, the people of those four departments who have gathered here, in a way their nature of work is such that if the same thing is to be decided by people sitting in Kashmir or by the people sitting in Kanyakumari then the central theme of that decision will be common. It is possible that depending upon the  availability of resources there could be some differences. For example, which government in India wouldn’t want that our youth participate in sports. I mean that all the Indian states want this thing. If all the states want this thing, can they come together to deliberate on this demographic dividend that is available to us. Today, we tell the world forcefully that we have 800 million youth below the age of 35. India is a young country. 65% people are below the age of 35. Is it not the responsibility of all governments, be it the centre or the states, to think that the country which has plenty of youth capital, what they can do for the country and the world? How should we channelise the power of our youth? What policies should be framed by our governments, what roadmap should be developed so that our youth power can be optimally utilized for the country and the world? We all should start thinking in this direction otherwise even in the previous century we should have seriously thought about these things but even now if we start thinking then these things can take us to very pleasant results. How our human resource should be developed? How our youth power should be identified in the world? How do we want to mould our youth power, how we want to shape them, how we want to go about this? We get happiness whenever we win some award in an international sports competition, and if we don’t win then feel that must think about this thing for the next time.

All of us have had student life. We used to think when examinations were drawing near that we will start studying immediately after school- college opens the next year. The first session passes gradually. We again decide in the vacation that I will start study as soon as school opens. Then gradually the exam time comes and we think that this time I will study till late night. If we fall asleep during the night then we think that tomorrow we will wake up early morning for study. We ask our mothers to wake us up early for study. We ourselves keep changing our timetable and keep adjusting ourselves. Keep trying to find ways. Is it not necessary that for sports tournaments we create an institutional arrangement that keeps providing our sportspersons the opportunity to participate in the tournaments?  It could be at tehsil level, district level, it could be inter school-college, players will not develop till the time we have regular sporting tournaments. Mere creating infrastructure is not enough, if there is a family which is very conscious, there may be one or two players that will follow the system and they can develop themselves by disciplined lifestyle but till the time we create the environment in the country we can’t get good people.

In case of cricket this environment is there to some extent.

People play cricket in every street, every locality and small games keeps getting organized. Players emerge from those games and a very large mechanism has developed but we have so much talent in the games other than cricket as well, we have capable people and talent is also important in international sports in addition to physical fitness. One has to prepare himself/herself as per those rules and regulation. We can take a decision after thoroughly reflecting on these issues, can formulate a scheme and you will see you will get the results in the equal measure.

World over sports is a government run program. It is directly linked to commonman, corporate houses are associated with them. Individual states can identify themselves with particular sports and take advantage of it. Have we ever mapped within our states that there must be one or two districts those will be doing well in football. There will be one or two districts those will be doing well in football or archery.  Till the time we map the potential at district level, what kind of infrastructure is available, for which sports we have good coaches and how to develop youth in those sports and if we don’t emphasise on these things then it is possible that every kind of sports will be played in every part of the country but we will not be able to get good results from that, that is why we need to change our strategy.

How our youth power can be utilized in nation building? Have we ever thought in that direction? Good quality debate, good leadership quality, their ability to try to figure out the problem of their villages, how we can utilize our youths. Today there is a digital movement going on this country. Youth has a tendency to grasp these things very fast. All of our system that are linked to youth, our organization, government mechanism, can we engage them in this work? You must have seen the Clean India Mission. In some states, in some cities, the youth ogranisations have given so much strength, so much reputation to the Clean India Program that it has provided a big opportunity to channelise, to mobilize their creativity.

You must have seen that in past some time that local artists and youths have decorated several railway stations. Those old stations got linked with today’s people. Railways has not spent any money. They brought their color with them, they have got the talent and they gave a new identity to their railway stations, their villages and if the passengers come then they leave only after seeing the entire station. How should we deploy our youth power in creative work? How to utilize their prowess? We should continuously think in that direction, should keep inventing new-newer schemes for that purpose.

We  have institutions like NSS, NCC. Despite that why our youth should lag behind in adventurous things. Why should they not have a desire to lead an adventurous life? Why shouldn’t they spend some of their time, vacation time in those areas? Sometimes we see that there is a mentality in our country that only white collar jobs are good rest everything is worthless. When our boys go to the other countries then they don’t hesitate in working in hotels during Saturday and Sunday because they see the work culture of that place. How can we develop this feeling, this value, this tradition in our youth to have respect for the manual labour, this thinking that manual labour is not a bad thing, it’s not a bad thing fetch your own glass of water? Can our small organizations that are active in this area, can they bring about this change, we need to work in that direction. Our cultural legacy is priceless. We can influence the world we have this kind of cultural legacy. But we could not present it before the world in the way it should have been presented because we have lost confidence in ourselves. How can there be a country in the world that does not take pride in its ancestor, in its traditions, culture and legacy. If we don’t take pride ourselves then what will show to the world? There should a feeling of pride for whatever we have, this should be part of our education, part of our youth culture and there should be a constant endeavor to present our cultural heritage as an unique heritage.  It will not work if we think that this is the work of some artist groups. This should be part of our society. If we move forward by making it as a part of our society then certainly it will produce results and we should try in that direction.

The countries that have developed tourism, had to develop  systems for artificial recreation where the facilities for entertainment were in place, people came from outside, they stayed, the technology was used. We are such people that have thousands of years old things and a sizeable number of people in the world have interest in such things. But it will be possible only when we talk to the world about our cultural heritage with great pride. With the kind of pride with which we talk about Taj Mahal, with the same kind of pride, you take our music, you take our musical instruments, we take the tradition of our instruments, we can take the rhythm of our music, these are wonders for the world. I mean, how we can talk about our heritages, our food, our cuisine, can anyone imagine how many kind of cuisines we have in India? We, we are born in India, if we start having a new food from a new state then our entire life is not enough for it. This is the kind of diversity we have. Have we ever familiarized the world with these diversities? Our country is not like that if there is a Pizza Hut in one corner of the country then there will be similar Pizza Hut two thousand kilometers away; if Pizza is prepared by using a process, then in the corner the same process will be used; if some ingredient are used in one place then the same ingredient will be used in the other place as well. In our country, if you start from South then you start with rice but as you move northward the rice will give way to wheat. These are the diversities that we can present to the world but we have not cared for those things that we have with us. Why not there should be a separate identity for each state?

Till the time we don’t develop a unique identity for states, even within states there are regions that can have unique identity.  If you visit Himachal, if you go towards Solan then you will come across to sign boards that read that Solan is a Mushroom city. When I was active in Himachal then it was my experience that they have popularized Solan as a Mushroom city. If you visit Surat then the people of Surat have popularized the city as Silk City. We do not make a conscious effort for special and careful branding of our legacies, our areas, our cities. You people are present here, if you discuss then it is possible that some issues will emerge out of it.

Today, tourism is a fast growing sector in the world. It’s growth rate is the fastest. The middle class of the world, upper middle class of the world is growing constantly. These people are ready to spend their money outside their countries. A country like India, can we look at the tourism as a target group for our country? What the world needs, what is available in which part of our country, have we ever analysed the psychology of tourist from fifty countries of the world?  If there is an European tourist among them then they would like to see these things. Those things are available in this part of our country and we should attract the tourists from Europe, we should connect the two. Neither we have mapped the places in our country that potential, nor have we analysed the liking of global tourists. We have seen that every segment in the world have its own choices and till the time they see the things they like; bird-watchers, if there is anyone in the world that spends the most then these are bird-watchers. Wherever they visit, they will stay there for complete month with their cameras, they will follow every single bird. These are the people who spend heavily. Have we mapped these things?

If you want to see this kind of birds then please visit this state, this region during this season. The bird-watchers clubs of the world know what is for bird-watchers in which corner of India. Have we linked the two? And once you come to know that there are 400 places in India that can be developed as a good destination for bird-watchers then what kind of infrastructure is needed for them? What kind of facilities are required? Do we make effort for this kind of targeted development? If we make effort in the direction of targeted development then we can get big results by spending small amount, we can develop this kind of system.

You people must have seen, those who have just arrived might not have seen, but those who would have come yesterday or today morning they must have seen that what a massive tourist destination can be created in the middle of the desert. It is one of the reasons behind organizing this workshop in the desert of Kachcha to show that if we make efforts then how can we take our things to people. Even the people living in Kachcha were not aware that they have such a big white desert. When this Kachch Ranotsav was started then it in itself becomes a big thing, the business worth 50 to 100 crore rupees is being generated in one district alone, handicraft sells. You see that how the global tourists can be attracted by creating a system. Today, you  yourself see this.

We have seen that in our tourist destinations there is no arrangement, no system for determining the language of the sign boards. If more tourists from Russia come to visit Goa then the businessmen of Goa desire to learn the Russian language and you must have seen that the small traders of Goa are able to learn the basic conversation in Russian language. Why? Because maximum number of tourists is coming from Russia and they thought it was imperative for them. But do we try? If more tourists from Europe visit Kullu-Manali then are there sign boards in European languages? We have not done it carefully. And a result of that we are not able to create tourist friendly environment. And due to this thing we are not able to reap due benefits. 

You people are sitting in Kutch, Dholavira is some 200-250 kilometers from that place, it’s a five thousand year old ancient city, it’s of the Mohenjo Daro period. If you have a program to visit Dholavira then you will see that even five thousand years ago there were signage in that city that if you will find these things if you go into this direction, you will find that place after 500 meters, and you will find this if you go left, all these signage are there. It means that even in that period five thousand years ago a lot of people from outside would have been visiting Dholavira that’s why signage were required. And Dholavira is considered the first place in the world with signage system. Have we ever thought that there can be some common things for signage in our tourist destinations? Due to which if someone comes from outside then he will know that this is written and it must mean this thing. I will get this thing here.

I have given a small example to develop our tourism in a scientific manner that how should we develop our tourism, even our literature is in which language, if more English speaking people are coming to my tourist destination and if my entire literature is in Hindi or in my local language then I will not be able to market despite huge amount. Our websites, we want to develop our websites for tourist destinations but most of the time they are in our own languages and do we develop our websites in their language if we want to tap the global market. And I don’t believe that this requires a lot of money.

Once we decide that we need to encourage tourism then you will see that it will happen. Sometimes it’s a cause of big concern that why tourists don’t come? Someone said because of lack of infrastructure. Why tourists don’t come if there is no infrastructure?  It’s such a tricky question that you need to have courage to get out of this dilemma.

People from HRD ministry are also sitting here. Can state governments decide this thing? Suppose the states decide this thing that if the students of a class are required for tourism once a year then they will visit different places of their villages. If they reach this age group then they will go to Tehsil, if they reach this standard then they will visit the district, in that standard they will visit the state and if we set up this kind of things for them then they would gradually come to know that what is there in their village, in their Tehsil, in their district. By the time they reach to the 10th standard he would know all these things. We don’t do these things, in our country if the student is in the fifth class but his teacher has not seen Udaipur then the teacher will take the students to Udaipur. He will not see what is there in the village.

There should be this understanding between our tourism ministry and our HRD ministry. Suppose that we decide that there are 10 destinations in our states that should be developed as tourist destination. All of you should collectively decide. You know that there is no hotel, no restaurant and no arrangement for food in those 10 places but it’s a good destination. Have you ever thought that you will first mobilize the resources of your own state? We should decide that all of our universities if they want to arrange a visit for students as a tourist then they must cover these 10 destinations within the state, will have to stay for two nights. That expenditure will be there as a tourist but in a way it will be a kind of investment.

Suppose that every day 10 buses of college students ply on a road and the people of that village see that people have started coming; now we should open the shops for selling roasted grams, snacks, start the work of providing water if it is required. All this will develop gradually. But we should start sending our tourists before developing a destination. And every state of India should select 5 destination, I’m not asking for more, just 5 destinations and they should aim to develop them to the international level and in the first two-three years it doesn’t matter if someone comes or not but at least students from the state should start visiting the place then the place will start developing automatically and tourists will start visiting that destination.

This desert of Kutch where you people are sitting, initially people from Gujarat itself started to visit it, at best people from Mumbai started to come but today online bookings are made a year in advance. Initially we have to make efforts like this then only the required infrastructure for the tourist destination is being determined and thereafter we should think of human resource. This is our misfortune that there is no course for the skill development of a guide, there is no course for development of human resource for the tourist destinations or religious places visited by the tourists. 

Why not prepare the youth of that city to work as guide, why not arrange special training for them? Why not there be competition among them? Why not there be a costume, uniform for them and guide should be in that uniform and why not he should have an identity card? Unless we bring this kind of professionalism we cannot develop our tourism sector.

India will have to focus on two kind tourism for development; one the traditional tourist; every son has this desire to take his parents for taking a dip in the river Ganges; every son has desire to take his parents to on a pilgrim of Char Dham; every son has this desire to take his parents on a pilgrim to Lord Shiva’s place, to Lord Ganesha’s place, this is naturally there. This kind of tourists will go on pilgrim in any case, they will go if there is arrangement or even if it is difficult.

These 1.25 billion countrymen are a big market in themselves. Have we ever addressed them? And these 1.25 billion people those who naturally want to visit the holy places and if we scientifically develop infrastructure there then it can also become a reason for attraction of global tourists.

The other category of tourists is those who will come from abroad, who they want to visit our destinations. They will have interest in beach tourism, in adventure tourism, in sports tourism, they might want to visit snow clad mountains of Himalayas or they might be interested in visiting Taj Mahal or Qutub Minar, they are of a different category. As long as we don’t think in the direction to provide facilities to our tourists till then we can’t strengthen our tourism sector.

All of you are sitting here. A program is perhaps going to be discussed there – ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’. Officers from HRD Ministry are also present there. We need give special attention to the programs like ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ to take our country forward. What happened! We told people either this or that. In such a large country this kind of thing doesn’t work. In our country if a boy knows the French Language then we mention this thing with pride that our neighbour’s son knows French; one of our children knows Spanish but we do not develop this kind of atmosphere in our country that a boy from Haryana should learn Telugu, a student from Gujarat should have a desire to learn Malyalam and if knows Malyalam then he should take pride in it.

We don’t take pride in our country’s heritage. The country which has more than 100 languages, more than 1,700 dialects, how rich that country is? Have we ever thought to connect our young generation with our this heritage? Sometimes we are aware what is there in the other country, but we are not aware about what is there in our states or our country. India is such a large country, we should thoroughly familiarize our future generations with our country, should connect them thoroughly and for that purpose this program of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ was launched. In the initial stage two states enter in to an MoU with each other and the effort is how those tow states can develop their relations. We do it with other states of the world, other cities of the world but we don’t do it within our own country. For example, as Haryana has done it with Telangana. Why not youth from Haryana should visit Telangana as a tourist throughout the year? Why not youth from Telangana should visit Haryana as a tourist throughout the year? The traditional sports of Haryana, the traditional sports Telangana, why not arrange sporting events of each other’s games in the other state? Why not organize Telugu Film Festival in Haryana? Why not organize Haryana’s Film Festival in Telugu (Telangana)? Why not organize the Telugu Play Festival in Haryana? Why not organize Haryana Film Festival in Telangana? We can easily teach 100 sentences of Telugu to the children of Haryana, the 100 sentences of basic conversation. We can teach the children of Telangana 100 words Haryanvi or Hindi.

You see, in our country, every 8th or 10th person in a state can speak the language of some other state without much effort. If someone comes, and he sees that the person of Tamil Nadu has come then he would start by saying ‘Vanakkam’. He immediately starts like this. That is why this my request to states is to come forward for this program – Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Excellent India). Be it HRD Ministry or be it Yuvak Seva and Sanskritik Brihuti, or be culture department or tourism department, these departments can play very important role catalytic agents.  

You, you see that our ministry of external affairs has started a quiz competition for overseas Indians spread throughout the world. The second-third generation of overseas Indians only that their ancestors were from India but they don’t know what is India. So they started an online quiz competition the last year. Last year, the five thousand kids who are from the families of Indian origin and are based in the different countries of the world, but they were not born here nor they ever came to India; these kids participated in this competition and tried to gather information about India and a very good program to award them was conducted on the second October.

Can we organize an online quiz competition for different states of our country? If Gujarat has entered into an MoU with Chhattisgarh then the kids of Chhattisgarh should answer the five thousand questions about Gujarat in the quiz competition, and kids of Gujarat should answer the five thousand questions about Chhattisgarh like how many districts are there, how many caste are there, what kind of languages, food and attire is there, which thing is where. You will see a massive integration will take place naturally. And if a kid gradually participates in 10 such competitions then how many things he would know about the country. I would like all the states to develop a separate quiz bank about, it should have, 2, 5 or 7 thousand questions and answers in it, and if possible the questions should be linked with relevant photographs, they should prepare an online platform and they should enter into MoUs with others and also conduct speech competition between their kids.

These days, we have asked the police contingents for 15th August and 26 January that if there is a parade on the 26th January then the police contingent from a state should visit the other state. The other state will be conducting parade, it will have its own police contingent for the parade. These are the things that bring us closer. These things can be done easily and we are emphasizing on them. We should make effort to make Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat program a success. And Indi is full of so much diversity, it is such a large country, it is such a diverse country that if we want to gain knowledge about our country then one life is not enough for this task and we will be happy to learn about every new thing.

As I have asked about one thing in this program – Ek Bharat, Shresthta Bharat, suppose if Haryana is with Telangana then can five songs of Telugu language be memorized? Can singing of five songs be learnt? Can people of Telangana learn to sing five songs of Haryana? And this will be fun, this will be pleasure for them and they will not have to make any extra effort. In a natural way we should learn the diversity of the country and it will strengthen the tourism.

It’s a work to re-energize our youth power. It’s an opportunity to take India to new heights by integrating it. We can see this thing here even if this is a small thing but it can bring about big changes. So you people are going to deliberate here for three days, you have come from the distant places, I hope that you people, particularly the members of council of ministers; they will certainly deliberate and provide the benefit of their experience, their vision to all the states. And when you people visit the desert in the evening, this land is very close to my heart, I’d like to give one advice to you people, you must go deep inside the desert, as far as permitted by the security forces, however, if it is possible then you should move away your colleagues and stand alone for 10 minutes at some distance, completely alone, you should experience that vast area, the blue sky, that white landscape; this is a very rare experience in life. However, if you just keep chatting with friends then you can’t experience this thing. For 15-20 minutes, all of you should spontaneously move away from each other by 20-25 steps, you all will experience a new thing and later you will inevitably share your experience with others. This is such a remote location that 10 years ago if someone wanted to visit it then it used to take 3-4 hours in the desert, today you must have reached within 50-60 minutes.

You have seen how dramatically things change after an earthquake. And this is the last village of India where you people are sitting. There is no inhabitation beyond that and you people are deliberating about India’s future in the last corner of this village. You are discussing how to develop India’s tourism sector. You are going to finish this discussion by making a resolve to inspire the young generation of the country.

I’m confident that your deliberation will play a very positive role in near future in the policy making. I convey my best wishes to you people on this occasion. I’m going to keep a close watch on the things discussed by you in the next two-three days as this topic is very close to my heart.

And there is a great potential in this sector and we need to develop it. So I’m going to take full advantage of your hard work, I want to get the maximum benefit out of it, I believe that you would certainly do this thing to provide maximum benefit to me. You people keep doing things for the benefit of the country but your experience will enhance my knowledge therefore I’ll wait for it.

I’m also waiting for that  elixir that will come out of your deliberations during the next three days. My best wishes to all of you. I congratulate Vijay Rupani Ji and his team because there is so much tourist rush in his area and arranging this conference, providing tents etc for this event, in the middle of all these things is bit difficult economically, but he is managing it, but due to this thing the people from all over the country have come here, they will also give publicity to your festival Ranotsava. It’s very much possible that due to this thing more and more people may start coming from their area, in a way that also is an investment for you. So I congratulate the government of Gujarat.

 

Thank you.

                आप में से बहुत लोग होंगे जो शायद कच्‍छ की धरती पर पहली बार आए होंगे और शायद कच्‍छ भी तो आए हो लेकिन इतना दूर पाकिस्‍तान की सीमा पर रेगिस्‍तान में कौन जाएगा? लेकिन आज आपको वहां भी जाने का अवसर मिला। जो हिमालय की वादियों से आए होंगे उनके लिए रेगिस्‍तान एक अलग अनुभव होगा। नॉर्थ ईस्‍ट में हरी-भरी झाड़ियोंके बीच जिन्‍होंने जिन्‍दगी गुजारी है उनके लिए रेगिस्‍तान का अनुभव कुछ और होता है और मुझे विश्‍वास है कि इस परिसर का भी आपके इस चिंतन शिविर पर सकारात्‍मक प्रभाव पैदा होगा। 

सरकार में बहुत आवश्‍यक होता है कि हम मिल--बैठ करके अपने कार्य को समझेअपने कार्य की रचना को समझे। किस प्रकार से दुनिया बदल रही है, उस बदलती हुई दुनिया में हम लोग कहां खड़े है कहां पहुंचना चाहते हैं, कहां तक पहुंच पाते हैं। इन बातों को लगातार हमें evaluate करते रहना चाहिए। दुर्भाग्‍य से सरकारों का एक स्‍वभाव बना हुआ है और वो silo में काम करने का। कभी-कभी तो एक डिपार्टमेंट के भीतर-भीतर ही silos होते है कि एक टेबल पर क्‍या चल रहा है वो जानकारी दूसरे टेबल को न मिल जाए उसकी चिंता होती है। 

एक Department का दूसरे Department के साथ तालमेल नहीं होता है और उसके कारण एक Department एक कार्यक्रम सोचता है तो दूसरा Department बिल्‍कुल उससे उल्‍टा सोचता है। कभी-कभी तो हैरानी होती है court के अंदर सरकार के ही दो Departments आमने-सामने वकीलों को पैसे देकर के लड़ाई लड़ते हैं। अब ये जो अवस्‍था है, ये अवस्‍था कोई स्‍वस्‍थ स्‍थिति नहीं है, उसमें बदलाव आना चाहिए और बदलाव आने का तरीका है कि हम मिल बैठकर के विस्‍तार से एक broad vision के अंतर्गत हमारी क्‍या भूमिका रहेगी, हमारे विभाग की क्‍या भूमिका रहेगी, हम क्‍या परिणाम ला सकते हैं, उसको सोचे तो अच्‍छा होगा। कुछ Department होते हैं, वैसे Department अलग होने के बावजूद भी like minded होते हैा। एक-दूसरे के साथ कोई न कोई उनका तालमेल होता है। 

यहां पर मुख्‍यत: जो चार मंत्रालय के लोग इकट्ठे हुए हैं। In a way इन सबका एक दूसरे के साथ कोई न कोई संबंध आता है और इसलिए अच्‍छा होगा कि हम मिल-बैठकर के अपने अनुभवों को share करे। Expert लोग है उनको सुने। अपनी कठिनाइयों के solution के हम लोगों ने कैसे-कैसे रास्‍ते खोजे हैं, क्‍या प्रयोग किए हैं, उसको समझने की कोशिश करें। अगर ये 3 दिन के वास्‍तवे के दरमियान formal जो सत्र होंगे उसके सिवाए जितना समय आप एक-दूसरे के साथ खुलकर के बातें करते-करते, भोजन करते समय, आते-जाते और tent-life में तो शायद रहने का पहली बार कईयों को तो अवसर आया होगा। हो सकता है अभी शायद गर्मी लगती हो लेकिन शाम ढलते ही वहां ठंड ज्‍यादा हो जाती है तो वो भी.. इन कठिनाइयों के बीच भी साथ जीने का एक मजा होता है तो अधिकृत सत्रों के सिवाए अपने-अपने राज्‍यों के अनुभव शेयर करे अपने साथियों के साथ, अन्‍य राज्‍यों से पूछे। ये एक प्रकार से हमारी बहुत बड़ी अमानत होगी जिसको हम आगे चलकर के अपनी नीतियों में, अपनी विकास की यात्रा में आगे बढ़ा सकते हैं। 

कुछ काम होते है कि जिसको डिपार्टमेंट के परे, केन्‍द्र राज्‍यों से परे हमें करने होते हैं। आज जो चार विभाग के लोग वहां इकट्ठे हुए हैं उनका एक प्रकार से कार्य का nature ऐसा है कि जिस nature के तहत कश्‍मीर में बैठे हुए लोगों को जो निर्णय करना होगा या कन्‍याकुमारी में बैठे हुए लोगों को निर्णय करना होगा वो निर्णय में केन्‍द्रीय विचार एक होगा। संसाधनों के अनुसार कम अधिक मात्रा में हो, वो संभव है। अब जैसे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की कौन सी सरकार होगी जो नहीं चाहती होगी कि हमारे युवा खेल-कूद के जगत में आगे आए। तात्‍पर्य यह हुआ कि हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के सभी राज्‍य चाहते हैं। अगर सब राज्‍य चाहते हैं तो क्‍या सब राज्‍य बैठकर के सोच सकते हैं क्‍या कि हमारे पास ये जो demographic dividend है। 

आज दुनिया के सामने हम ताकत के साथ कहते हैं कि हमारे 800 मिलियन 35 से कम आयु के युवा वर्ग है। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान जवान है। 35 साल से कम उम्र के 65 प्रतिशत लोग है। क्‍या हम सब सरकारों का, केन्‍द्र हो या राज्‍य हो, हम लोगों का दायित्‍व नहीं बनता है कि हम सोचे कि जिस देश के पास इतना युवा धन हो, वो देश और दुनिया को क्‍या दे सकते हैं। हम युवा धन की शक्‍तियों को किस प्रकार से channelize करें। हमारी सरकारें वो क्‍या नीतियां बनाएं, किस प्रकार के road map बनाए ताकि हमारी युवा शक्‍ति का सर्वाधिक उपयोग देश और दुनिया को हो सके। अगर हम अभी से, वैसे हमें पिछली शताब्‍दी में इन विषयों को गंभीरता से सेाचने की जरूरत थी। लेकिन अब भी अगर हम शुरू करेंगे तो हो सकता है कि चीजें हम बहुत ही सुखद परिणाम की ओर ले जा सकते हैं। हमारा Human resource development कैसा होगा। दुनिया के सामने हमारे youth power की पहचान क्‍या होगी। हमारे youth power को किस रूप में हम मोड़ना चाहते हैं, किस रूप में ढालना चाहते हैं, किस रूप में आगे बढ़ाना चाहते हैं। जब भी अंतर्राष्‍ट्रीय खेल-कूद की स्‍पर्धा होती है, कोई अवार्ड मिलता है तो खुशी होती है। नहीं मिलता है तो लगता है नहीं-नहीं अगली बार सोचना ही पड़ेगा। 

हम सबने विद्यार्थी काल में देखा होगा। हम लोगों का स्‍वभाव रहता है कि exam आता है तो हम सोचते हैं कि बस अगले साल तो स्‍कूल-कॉलेज खुलने से ही पढ़ाई शुरू करनी है। धीरे-धीरे करके पहला सत्र चला जाता है। vacation में फिर तय करते हैं कि नहीं इस बार तो जैसे ही vacation में स्‍कूल खुलेंगे, मैं पढ़ना ही शुरू कर दूंगा। फिर धीरे-धीरे exam आ जाते हैं तो सोचते है कि नहीं-नहीं अब तो रात को देर तक पढ़ना है। रात को नींद आती है तो सोचते है सुबह जल्‍दी उठकर के पढ़ना है। मां को भी कह देते है कि मां जरा मुझे सुबह जल्‍दी उठा देना मुझे कल पढ़ना है। हम अपने आप अपना टाइमटेबल बदलते चलते हैं और खुद को adjust करते रहते हैं। रास्‍ते खोजते रहते हैं। क्‍या ये आवश्‍यक नहीं है कि अगर खेलकूद के स्‍पर्धा के लिए हम एक ऐसा institutional arrangement करें, लगातार हमारे खिलाड़ियों को स्‍पर्धाओं में जाने का अवसर मिलता रहे। वो तहसील स्‍तर की हो, जिला स्‍तर की हो, स्‍कूल-कॉलेज के बीच की हो, जब तक निरंतर खेलकूद की स्‍पर्धाएं नहीं होती है, खिलाड़ी तैयार नहीं होते हैं। हम सिर्फ infrastructure बना दे, इतने मात्र से बहुत ही परिवार जागरूक होगा कोई एकाध खिलाड़ी होगा जो अपना एक वर्तस्‍थ जीवन जीता है और लग जाए तो आगे निकल जाता है लेकिन जब तक देश में एक माहौल नहीं बनाते तो हमें अच्‍छे लोग नहीं मिलते। क्रिकेट में ये बना हुआ है कुछ मात्रा में। हर गली-मोहल्‍ले में लोग क्रिकेट खेलते हैं छोटे-छोटे games चलते रहते हैं। उसमें से खिलाड़ी उभरकर के आते हैं और एक बहुत बड़ा mechanism खड़ा हो गया लेकिन हमारे देश के पास क्रिकेट के सिवाए भी बहुत कौशल्‍य है, सामर्थ्‍यवान लोग है और physical fitness के साथ-साथ अंतर्राष्‍ट्रीय खेल जगत में talent का भी उतना ही महत्‍व होता है। उन rules and regulation के बीच अपने आप को तैयार करना होता है। हम जितनी मात्रा में इन बातों पर सोच करके कोई निर्णय कर सकते हैं, कोई योजना बना सकते हैं, आप देखिए परिणाम मिलना शुरू होगा। 

दुनिया में स्‍पोर्ट्स सरकारी कार्यक्रम कम है। जन सामान्‍य से जुड़ा हुआ है, कॉरपोरेट हाउस उसके साथ जुड़े हुए होते हैं। एक-एक game के साथ एक-एक राज्‍य अपनी identification करके उसका फायदा उठा सकते हैं। हमने क्‍या कभी हमारे राज्‍य के अंदर कभी मैपिंग किया है कि एक-आध district होगा जो फुटबॉल में अच्‍छा खेलता होगा। एक-आध district होगा जो वॉलीबॉल में अच्‍छा करता होगा।एक-आध district होगा जो शायद तीरंदाजी में अच्‍छा करता होगा। जब तक district level की हमारी potential की मैपिंग नहीं करते, हमारे पास कहां किस प्रकार का infrastructure है किस खेलकूद के अंदर अच्‍छे हमारे पास coaches है और उस क्षेत्र में कैसे-कैसे हमारे नौजवान तैयार होते है, उस पर अगर बल नहीं देते है तो हम हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर कोने के लोगों को हर प्रकार के खेल खेलते रहेंगे तो हो सकता है कि हम कहीं पर भी कुछ भी नहीं निकाल पाएंगे तो आवश्‍यकता है कि हम बदलाव करें। 

हमारी युवा शक्‍ति राष्‍ट्र निर्माण के कार्य में कैसे उपयोगी होगी। क्‍या उस दिशा में कभी हमने सोचा है। अच्‍छी debate,अच्‍छी leadership quality, गांव की समस्‍याओं को समझने का उनका प्रयास हमारी युवा शक्‍ति का उपयोग कैसे हो सकता है। आज देश में digital movement चल रहा है। युवा समाज बहुत तेजी से इन चीजों को capture करने का स्‍वभाव रखता है। हमारे जितने युवकों से जुड़े हुए जितनी व्‍यवस्‍थाएं हैं, संगठन है, सरकारी mechanism है, क्‍या हम ऐसे काम में उनको लगा सकते हैं क्‍या। आपने देखा होगा स्‍वच्‍छ भारत अभियान। कई राज्‍यों के कई शहरों के युवा संगठनों ने अपने initiative से स्‍वच्‍छ भारत अभियान को इतनी ताकत दी है, इतनी प्रतिष्‍ठा दी है तो उनकी एक creativity को channelize करने का mobilize करने का एक बहुत अवसर मिलता है। 

आपने देखा होगा पिछले दिनों कई रेलवे स्‍टेशन को लोगों ने local कलाकार युवकों ने मिलकर के सुशोभित किया। अब पहले के जमाने के रेलवे स्‍टेशन और आज जहां लोग जुड़ गए। रेलवे ने कुछ खर्चा नहीं किया। वे लोग आए अपना कलर-वलर लेकर के उनके पास talent थी उन्होंने अपने रेलवे स्टेशन को अपनेगांव की पहचान दे दी तो पैसेंजर आते हैं तो रेलवे स्‍टेशन पूरा देखकर जाते हैं। हम हमारी युवा शक्‍ति को creative कामों में कैसे लगाए। उनके सामर्थ्‍य का उपयोग कैसे करे।उस दिशा में हम लोगों को निरंतर सोचना चाहिए, उसके लिए नई-नई योजनाओं की रचना करनी चाहिए। 

हमारे पास NSS, NCC ये सारी रचनाएं हैं। उसके बाद भी साहसिक कामों में हमारे देश का युवा पीछे क्‍यों रहे। साहसपूर्ण जीवन की उसके मन में इच्‍छा क्‍यों न जगे। वो अपना कुछ समय, vacation का समय वहां क्‍यों न बिताएं। कभी-कभार देखते है कि हमारे देश में श्रम के प्रति एक ऐसी सोच बने कि White color job ही अच्‍छी चीज है बाकिसब बेकार है। दुनिया में जब हमारे बालक जाते है तो Saturday Sunday को होटल में काम करने को उनको संकोच नहीं होता है क्‍योंकि वहां का कल्‍चर देखते हैं। भारत के युवा के मन में भी श्रम के प्रति प्रतिष्‍ठा, हाथ से करने वाला काम बुरा नहीं होता है। खुद का पानी खुद हाथ में लेकर के पीना बुरा नहीं होता है। ये संस्‍कार, परंपरा हम कैसे विकसित करें। हमारे ये जो छोटे-मोटे संगठन काम कर रहे हैं वे ये बदलाव ला सकते हैं क्‍या, उस दिशा में प्रयास करने की आवश्‍यकता है। हमारी सांस्‍कृतिक विरासत अनमोल है। हम दुनिया पर प्रभाव पैदा कर सके, इतनी सांस्‍कृतिक विरासत है हमारे पास। लेकिन हम जिस तरीके से विश्‍व के सामने उसको ले जाना चाहिए वो ले नहीं पाए है क्‍योंकि हमने हमारे भीतर एक विश्‍वास खो दिया है। ऐसा कैसा देश हो सकता है कि जिसे अपने पूर्वजों पर, अपनी पुरानी परंपराओं पर, अपनी संस्‍कृति पर, विरासत पर गर्व न हो। अगर हमें ही गर्व नहीं होगा तो हम दुनिया को क्‍या दिखाएंगे। हमारे पास जो है, उसके प्रति गर्व का भाव, ये हमारी शिक्षा का हिस्‍सा हो, हमारी युवा प्रवृत्‍ति का हिस्‍सा हो और हमारी सांस्‍कृतिक विरासत को विश्‍व के सामने एक अनोखी विरासत के रूप में रखने का हमारा निरंतर प्रयास होना चाहिए। सिर्फ कुछ कला मंडलियां,ये उनका काम है, ऐसा मानकर के हम चलेंगे तो नहीं चलेगा। ये समाज का हिस्‍सा होना चाहिए। अगर ये समाज का हिस्‍सा बनाकर के हम चलते हैं तो अवश्‍य उसका एक अलग परिणाम मिलता है और उस दिशा में हमें प्रयास करना चाहिए। 

दुनिया के देशों के पास, अगर उन्‍होंने टूरिज्‍म भी डेवलप किया है तो artificial recreation के लिए उनको व्‍यवस्‍थाएं विकसित करनी पड़ी जहां एंटरटेनमेंट की सुविधा हो, लोग बाहर से आए, रहे, टैक्‍नोलॉजी का उपयोग हो। हम वो लोग है जिनके पास हजारों वर्ष पुरानी चीजें उपलब्‍ध है और दुनिया का एक बहुत बड़ा वर्ग है कि जिसको इसके अंदर रुचि होती है। लेकिन ये तब संभव होता है जब हम हमारी सांस्‍कृतिक विरासत के प्रति बड़े गौरव के साथ दुनिया को हम कहे। जितने गौरव से हम ताजमहल की चर्चा करते है, उतने ही गौरव से हमारे अनेक प्रकार के, even हमारा संगीत ले लें, हमारे वाद्य ले लें, हमारे वाद्य की परंपरा ले लें, हमारे संगीत के राग-रागिणी ले लें, दुनिया के लिए अजूबा है। यानी हम किस प्रकार से हमारी विरासतों को, खान-पान, कोई कल्‍पना कर सकता है कि भारत में कितने प्रकार का खान-पान है। हम लोग, हम हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में पैदा हुए है, अगर हम हर दिन एक नए राज्‍य के नए खाने के तरीके को खाना शुरू करे तो शायद हमारा भी एक जीवन कम पड़ जाएगा। इतनी विविधताएं हैं। इन विविधताओं से दुनिया को हमने परिचित करवाया है। हमारा देश ऐसा नहीं है कि भई एक कोने में पिज्‍ज़ा हट है तो 2000 किमी. दूर दूसरे कोने में भी वैसा ही पिज्‍ज़ा हट होगा। एक कोने में जिस प्रोसेस से पिज्‍ज़ा बनता है, उसी processसे यहां भी बनता होगा। जो ingredient वहां होंगे, वहीं ingredient यहां होंगे। यहां तो दक्षिण में शुरू कर दिया तो चावल से शुरू करते ऊपर जाते-जाते चावल खत्‍म हो जाता है और गेहूं पर चले जाते हैं। ये विविधताएं हैं जो दुनिया के सामने रखने की ताकत रखते हैं। लेकिन हमने इन चीजों पर ध्‍यान नहीं दिया कि हमारे पास क्‍या है। हर राज्‍य की एक पहचान क्‍यों न हो। 

जब तक हम एक राज्‍य की अपनी एक पहचान नहीं बनाते है शायद राज्‍य में भी कुछ इलाके होते हैं जिसकी पहचान खड़ी की जा सकती है। अब आप लोग हिमाचल जाएंगे तो सोलन की तरफ जाएंगे तो वहां पर बोर्ड लगे रहते हैं - सोलन की ओर, ये Mushroom City है। मै जब हिमाचल में काम करता था तब का मेरा अनुभव है तो उन्‍होंने उसको एक Mushroom City के रूप में popular कर दिया। अगर आप सूरत जाएंगे तो सूरत के लोगों ने उसको Silk City के रूप में popular कर दिया। हमने अपनी ऐसी जो-जो विरासतें हैं उसका एक special branding बड़ा carefully अपने इलाकों का, अपने शहरों का, हम उस दिशा में conscious प्रयास नहीं करते। आप लोग बैठे हैं चर्चा करेंगे, हो सकता है इसमें से कई मुद्दे आपको निकलकर के आएंगे। 

आज विश्‍व में टूरिज्‍म बहुत तेज गति से आगे बढ़ने वाला व्‍यवसायिक क्षेत्र है। सबसे तेज गति से उसका growth हो रहा है। दुनिया का middle class, upper middle class का bulk बढ़ता चला जा रहा है। upper middle class, middle class के लोग अपना धन बाहर जा करके खर्च करने के लिए तैयार भी होते हैं। भारत जैसा देश विश्‍व के टूरिज्‍म को हम हमारा target group के रूप में सोच सकते हैं क्‍या? दुनिया को क्‍या चाहिए, हमारे देश में किस इलाके में क्‍या है, क्‍या हमने कभी विश्‍व के 50 देश वहां के Tourist की Psychology को Analyzes किया है क्‍या? उसमें यूरोप का Tourist टूरिस्‍ट होगा तो उसको ये ये चीजें देखने का शौक है ये-ये पसंद है। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के इस कोने में वो चीजें हैं जो यूरोप के Tourist को हमने आकर्षित करना चाहिए, इन दोनों को जोड़ना चाहिए। न हमने हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में हमारा Potential कहां है उसको Mapping किया है, न हमने दुनिया के टूरिस्‍टों को क्‍या पसंद है; हमने देखा है। हर दुनिया के हर वर्ग का अपना एक Choice होता है, जब तक वो उस प्रकार की चीजें नहीं देखता है। Bird-Watchers, शायद दुनिया में सबसे ज्‍यादा खर्च वो करने वाले लोग कोई हो तो Bird-Watchers होते हैं। वो जहां जाएंगे महीने भर अपना कैमरा ले करके पड़े रहते हैं और एक-एक पंखी के पीछे लगे रहते हैं, एक-एक चिडि़या के पीछे लगे रहते हैं। अब वो बहुत पैसे खर्च करने वाले लोग होते हैं। हमारे पास Mapping है क्‍या कहीं? 

इस प्रकार के Birds देखने हैं तो इस राज्‍य में जाइए, तो इस इलाके में जाइए, इस मौसम में जाइए। दुनिया में Bird-Watchers के जो क्‍लबें हैं उनको पता है क्‍या कि हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के इस कोने में से Bird-Watchers के लिए जगह है। क्‍या हमने उनको दोनों को Link किया है क्‍या? और अगर एक बार पता चल जाए भई भारत के अंदर ये चार सौ स्‍थान ऐसे हैं कि जहां पर Bird-Watchers कि लिए एक अच्‍छा Destination बन सकता है तो Bird-Watchers को क्‍या क्‍या Infrastructure चाहिए? किस प्रकार की सुवधिाएं चाहिए? हम ऐसे Targeted Development की दिशा में प्रयास करते हैं क्‍या? अगर हम Targeted Development की दिशा में प्रयास करेंगे तो हम बहुत कम खर्च से ज्‍यादा Outcome निकाल सकें, ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍था विकसित कर सकते हैं। 

आपने देखा होगा, जो लोग अभी-अभी पहुंचे होंगे शायद वो देख नहीं पाए होंगे; लेकिन जो कल आए होंगे या सुबह पहुंचे होंगे उन्‍होंने देखा होगा, ये रेगिस्‍तान के अंदर कि कितना बड़ा Tourist Destination खड़ा किया जा सकता है। ये एक कार्यशाला ये Workshop कच्‍छ के रेगिस्‍तान में रखने के पीछे का कारण ये भी है कि हम देखें के एक बार अगर हम प्रयास करें तो हम किस प्रकार से हमारी चीजों को लोगों के पास ले जा सकते हैं। कच्‍छ में रहने वाले लोगो हों वे भी, पता नहीं था उनके पास इतना बड़ा White रेगिस्‍तान है। जब ये कच्‍छ रणोत्‍सव शुरू हुआ तो वो अपने-आप में एक बहुत बड़ा हाल 50 सौ करोड़ रुपये के करीब-करीब इसका कारोबार एक जिले में हो जाता है। Handicraft बिक जाता है। आप देखिए एक व्‍यवस्‍था खड़ी करने से दुनिया के टूरिस्‍टों को किस प्रकार से आकर्षित किया जा सकता है। आज स्‍वयं आज वहां देख रहे हैं। 

हमने देखा है कि हमारे Tourist Destination हों, लेकिन Signages उस पर किस language में बोर्ड होंगे, हमारे कोई व्‍यवस्‍था नहीं है। अगर गोवा के अंदर Russian Tourist ज्‍यादा आते हैं तो गोवा के व्‍यापारियों को Russian भाषा सीखने की इच्‍छा होती है और आपने देखा होगा कि गोवा के जो छोटे-छोटे व्‍यापारी होते हैं वो रूसी Language टूटी-फूटी बोलना सीख लेते हैं। क्‍यों? क्‍योंकि Maximum रूसी Tourist आने शुरू हो गए तो उनको लगने लगा कि भई हमारे लिए आवश्‍यक है, लेकिन हम कोशिश करते हैं क्‍या? अगर कुल्‍लू-मनाली के अंदर यूरोपियन Tourist ज्‍यादा आते हैं तो यूरोप की जो Languages हैं, उसके कोई Signages वहां हैं क्‍या? ये हमने Carefully किया नहीं है। और उसका परिणाम ये होता है कि Tourists Friendly हम Environment create नहीं कर पाते हैं। और उसके कारण हमें जो लाभ मिलना चाहिए वो लाभ नहीं होता। 

आप लोग कच्‍छ में बैठे हैं, आप कच्‍छ में एक दो सौ, ढाई सौ किलोमीटर आप जहां हैं वहां से दूर धौलाविरा है, ये पांच हजार साल पुरानी नगर रचना है धौल विरा, मोहनजोदड़ो कालखंड का है। अगर वहां आपको जाने का अगर आप लोगों का कार्यक्रम बनाया होगा तो वहां देखोगे पांच हजार साल पहले भी उस शहर के अंदर Signages थे, कि इस तरफ जाने की जगहें ये हैं, 500 मीटर के बाद वो जगह है, बाईं ओर जाआगे तो ये, ये सब वहां पर Signages हैं। इसका मतलब हुआ कि उस जमाने में पांच हजार साल पहले उस धौलाविरा में बाहर से लोगों का आना-जाना बहुत होता रहता होगा, तब जा करके Signages की जरूरत पड़ी होगी। और वो दुनिया में सबसे पहली Signages वाली व्‍यवस्‍था के रूप में ये धौलाविरा को माना जाता है। क्‍या हम लोगों ने कभी ये सोचा है कि हमारे Tourist Destination की Signages की Common कुछ चीजें हो सकती हैं क्‍या? जिसके कारण बाहर से जो आएगा उसको लगे हां भई ये लिखा है मतलब ये होगा। यहां मुझे ये उपलब्‍ध होगा। 

हम scientific तरीके से हमारे Tourism को develop करने के लिए, मैंने छोटा उदाहरण इसलिए दिया कि हमें ध्‍यान में आएगा कि हमने Tourism को विकसित करने के लिए even हमारा Literature किस Language में है, अगर मेरे उस Tourist destination पर अंग्रेजी Speaking लोग ज्‍यादा आते हैं, लेकिन अगर मेरा वहां का सारा Literature हिन्‍दी में है या मेरी वहां की Local language में है तो मैं खर्च करने के बाद भी मैं उसका Marketing नहीं कर पा रहा हूं। हमारी Websites, Tourist destination के लिए Website हम Develop करना चाहते हैं, लेकिन ज्‍यादातर हमारी Website हमारी अपनी भाषा में है जबकि हमें एक Global Market को अगर पकड़ना है तो हमने उसकी भाषा में हमारी Website बनाते हैं क्‍या? और मैं नहीं मानता हूं कि कोई ज्‍यादा खर्च कर का काम है। 

ये हम लोग तय करें कि भई हां हमें Tourism को बढ़ावा देना है तो आप देखिए हो जाएगा। कभी-कभार एक बड़ी चिंता का विषय रहता है Tourism में कि भई लोग क्‍यों नहीं आते? बोले Infrastructure नहीं है। Infrastructure क्‍यों नहीं है तो लोग नहीं आते हैं। ये ऐसा द्वंद्व है कि जिस द्वंद्व में आपको खुद को हिम्‍मत करके निकलना पड़ता है। 

वहां पर HRD Ministry के लोग भी बैठे हैं। राज्‍य की सरकारें ये तय कर सकती हैं क्‍या? मान लीजिए अपने राज्‍य में तय करें कि भई इस कक्षा के जो Student होंगे वे साल में एक बार उनको पर्यटन के लिए जाना है तो अपने गांव के ही अलग-अलग जगह पर जाएंगे। इस उम्र के पहुंचें तो फिर तहसील में, इस Standard में आए तो जिले में जाएंगे। उस Standard में गए तो राज्‍य में जाएंगे। हम इस प्रकार का उनके लिए काम तय करते हैं तो वो धीरे-धीरे, धीरे-धीरे उनको पता चलेगा उनके गांव में क्‍या है, तहसील में क्‍या है, जिले में क्‍या है? वो Tenth में पहुंचेगा तब तक उसको सारा पता चल जाएगा। हम ऐसा नहीं करते, हमारे यहां तो पांचवी कक्षा का Student होगा, लेकिन टीचर ने अगर उदयपुर नहीं देखा है, तो टीचर उसको उदयपुर ले जाएगा। गांव में क्‍या उसने देखा नहीं होगा। 

हमने HRD Ministry ने और हमारी Tourism Ministry के बीच ये तालमेल हो। मान लीजिए हम तय करें कि हमारे राज्‍य में 10 जगहें ऐसी हैं जो Tourist destination के लिए Develop करनी हैं। स‍ब मिल करके तय करें। आपको पता है कि उन दस जगहे पर आज न Hotel हैं न restaurants हैं, न खानपान की व्‍यवस्‍था है, लेकिन destination अच्‍छा है। क्‍या आपने कभी ये सोचा है कि आप पहले अपने राज्‍य के जो resources हैं, उनको Mobilize करेंगे। तय करें कि भई हमारी सभी Universities पांच साल तक Tourist के नाते कहीं जाना है तो पहले ये दस Destination जो राज्‍य ने तय किए हैं वहां तो जाना ही पड़ेगा, दो रात रुकना ही पड़ेगा। वो खर्चा होगा Tourist के नाते, लेकिन इन प्रकार के Investment होगा। 

मान लीजिए हर दिन एक दस Buses आती हैं Collage Students की, उस गांव के लोग तय कर लें कि भईया लोग आने लगे हैं; चलो, चने मुरमुरे बेचने की दुकान कर लो, चलो पकौड़े बनाने की दुकान कर लो, चलो पानी लोगों को चाहिए तो पानी लाने का काम। धीरे-धीरे, धीरे-धीरे Develop हो जाएगा। लेकिन हम कभी हमारे अपने Destination को Develop करने के लिए पहले हमारे टूरिस्‍टों को भेजना चाहिए। ये हम प्राय:, अगर हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर राज्‍य पांच Destination तय करे जहां, ज्‍यादा मैं नहीं कर रहा हूं; पांच Destination, और International Level का Destination बनाने के इरादे से करें और शुरू के दो-तीन साल और कोई आए या ना आए, अपने राज्‍य के student जाना शुरू कर दे। वहां अपने-आप में एक प्रकार का बदलाव आना शुरू हो जायेगा, tourist आना शुरू होंगे। 

ये जिस कच्‍छ के रेगिस्‍तान में बैठे हैं, शुरू में गुजरात के ही लोग आए थे; ज्‍यादा से ज्‍यादा मुम्‍बई के लोग आना शुरू हुआ, लेकिन आज Online booking एक-एक साल पहले होने लग गया। हमने पहले इस प्रकार का प्रयास करना पड़ता है तब जा करके Tourist destination के लिए जो आवश्‍यक Infrastructure होता है वो तय होता है फिर वहां Human resource के लिए चिन्‍ता करनी चाहिए। हमारा दुर्भाग्‍य है कि जो हमारे Tourist destination हैं, या religious places हैं जहां पर Tourist जाते हैं, लेकिन वहां पर गाईड के लिए skill development, Human resource development का कोई courses नहीं होते। उस नगर में गाईड के नाते काम करने वाले Youth क्‍यों न तैयार हो, उनकी special training क्‍यों न हो? उनकी competition क्‍यों न हो? उनके, उनके costume क्‍यों न तैयार हों। उसी यूनिफॉर्म में गाईड होना चाहिए, गाईड के पास Identity Card क्‍यों नहीं होना चाहिए, हम जब तक ये Professionalism नहीं लाएंगे हम Tourism क्षेत्र को develop नहीं कर सकते हैं। 

भारत ने दो प्रकार के Tourism develop को Focus करना होगा; एक परंपरागत यात्री; हर बेटे को रहता है कि मेरे मां-बाप को कभी न कभी तो गंगा स्‍नान कराऊं; हर बेटे को रहता है कि मेरे मां-बाप को कभी न कभी तो चार धाम यात्रा कराऊं; हर बेटे को रहता है कि मेरे मां बाप को कभी शिवजी के स्‍थान पर ले जाऊं, गणेश जी के स्‍थान पर ले जाऊं, ये स्‍वाभाविक रहता है। ये जो परंपरागत है वो जाने ही वाले हैं, व्‍यवस्‍था होगी तो भी जाएंगे, कठिनाई होगी तो भी जाएंगे। 

ये सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों का ये भी अपना एक बहुत बड़ा मार्केट है। क्‍या कभी हमने उनको Address किया है? और हमारे सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी जो सहज रूप से यात्रा के स्‍थान पर जाना चाहते हैं, वहां अगर वैज्ञानिक तरीके से सोच करके हम Infrastructure तैयार करते हैं, तो वो ही Global Tourist के लिए भी एक आकर्षण का कारण बन सकता है। 

दूसरे Tourist वो हैं जो विदेशों से भी आएंगे, जो हमारी और चीजें देखना चाहते हैं। उनको Beach Tourism में interest होगा, उनको Adventure Tourism में interest होगा, उनको Sports Tourism में होगा, उनको हिमालय की बर्फीली जगह पर जाने की इच्‍छा होगी, उनको हो सकता है ताजमहल या कुतुबमीनार देखने होंगे, तो ये एक अलग category के हैं। हम जब तक हमारे Tourist के लिए क्‍या-क्‍या व्‍यवस्‍थाएं कर सकते हैं, उस दिशा में अगर हम नहीं सोचते हैं, हम Tourism को बल नहीं दे सकते हैं। 

आप सब लोग वहां बैठे हैं। एक कार्यक्रम की चर्चा शायद वहां होने वाली है, ''एक भारत, श्रेष्‍ठ भारत''। HRD Ministry के भी अफसर वहां बैठे हुए हैं। एक भारत, श्रेष्‍ठ भारत, भारत जैसे देश को हमने आगे बढ़ाने के लिए हमने बहुत बल देने की आवश्‍यकता है। हुआ क्‍या, हमने लोगों से यही कहा कि भई या तो ये या तो वो। इतने बड़े देश में या तो ये या तो वो नहीं चलता। हमारे देश में कोई लड़का French Language जानता है, तो हम सीना तानकर देखो ये हमारा पड़ोसी हैं, उनका बेटा French Language भी जानता है; हमारा कोई बच्‍चा Spanish जानता है तो हम कहते हैं देखिए हमारा बच्‍चा वहां Spanish जानता है, लेकिन हम देश के अंदर ये माहौल नहीं बनाते हैं कि हरियाणा का बच्‍चा, वो भी तो तेलुगु भाषा बोलना सीखना चाहिए; गुजरात का बच्‍चा, उसको भी तो कभी मलयालम सीखने का मन करना चाहिए, और उसको मलयालम आता है तो उसका उसको proud feel होना चाहिए। 

हम देश के अंदर अपनी जो विरासत है इसके प्रति गौरव नहीं कर रहे। जिस देश के पास 100 से ज्‍यादा भाषाएं हों, 1700 से ज्‍यादा Dialects हो, वो देश कितना अमीर है! क्‍या कभी हमने इस विरासत के प्रति हमारी युवा पीढ़ी को जोड़ने के लिए सोचा है? हम कभी-कभी दुनिया के फलाने देश में क्‍या है उसका तो ज्ञान रखते हैं, लेकिन मेरे ही देश में या मेरे ही राज्‍य में किस कोने में क्‍या है; उसका अज्ञान है। भारत इतना विशाल देश है, हम हमारी आने वाली पीढ़ी को भारत से भली-भांति परिचित करवाएं, भली-भांति जोडें और उसी के लिए सरदार पटेल जयंती के दिन ''एक भारत श्रेष्‍ठ भारत'' इस कार्यक्रम का आरंभ किया है। प्रारंभ में दो राज्‍य एक-दूसरे के साथ MoU करते हैं, और कोशिश ये है कि दो राज्‍य एक-दूसरे के साथ अपने संबंधों को कैसे विकसित करें? हम विश्‍व के तो कई राज्‍यों के साथ कर लेते हैं, विश्‍व के शहरों के साथ भी करते हैं, लेकिन अपने ही देश में नहीं करते। अब जैसे हरियाणा ने तेलंगना के साथ किया है। हरियाणा के नौजवान Tourist के नाते ये साल भर तेलंगना क्‍यों न जाएं? तेलंगना के नौजवान इस साल भर Tourist के नाते हरियाणा क्‍यों न जाएं? हरियाणा की Traditional खेलकूद, तेलंगना Traditional खेलकूद; इन दोनों की खेलकूद के कार्यक्रम हरियाणा और तेलंगना में एक-दूसरे के क्‍यों न हों? हरियाणा में तेलुगु फिल्‍म का Film Festival क्‍यों न हो? तेलुगु में हरियाणा का Film Festival क्‍यों न हो? हरियाणा में तेलुगु भाषा का नाट्य महोत्‍सव क्‍यों न हो? तेलंगना में हरियाणा का नाट्य महोत्‍सव क्‍यों न हो? सहज रूप से हरियाणा के बच्‍चों को एक साल में 100 तेलुगु वाक्‍य सिखा सकते हैं, बोलचाल के 100 वाक्‍य। तेलंगना के बच्‍चों को 100 हरियाणवी भाषा के, हिंदी भाषा के वाक्‍य सिखा सकते हैं। 

आप देखिए, देख में बिना कोशिश किए हर राज्‍य में हर दसवें-आठवें पद में आदमी कोई न कोई राज्‍य की भाषा बोल लेता होगा। कोई आएगा तो उसको लगेगा, अच्‍छा भई तमिलनाडु का आया आओ, आओ वाणकम्‍म कहके शुरू करेंगे। तुरंत शुरू हो जाता है। इसलिए मेरा आग्रह है कि ''एक भारत श्रेष्‍ठ भारत'' इस कार्यक्रम के लिए राज्‍य आगे आएं। HRD Ministry हो, युवक सेवा एंड सांस्‍कृतिक बृहुति हो, Culture Department और Tourism Department हों, ये Department हैं जो Catalytic Agent के रूप में बहुत बड़ा काम कर सकते हैं। 

आप, आप मान लीजिए Quiz Competition, इन दिनों हमारे विदेश विभाग ने विश्‍वभर में फैले हुए भारतीय समुदाय के लिए एक Quiz Competition शुरू किया है। जो दूसरी-तीसरी पीढ़ी से लोग विदेश में हैं उनके बच्‍चों को इतना तो मालूम है कि उनके पूर्वज भारत के हैं, लेकिन उनको मालूम नहीं भारत क्‍या है। तो उन्‍होंने एक Online Quiz Competition शुरू किया। पिछले वर्ष पांच हजार (5000) दुनिया के अलग-अलग देशों के बच्‍चे जो मूल भारतीय परिवार के हैं, लेकिन वो पैदा यहां नहीं हुए; न कभी हिन्‍दुस्‍तान देखा है, इस Competition में भाग लिया, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की जानकारियां पाने का प्रयास किया, और उनका एक ईनाम देने का कार्यक्रम भी बहुत अच्‍छा हो गया, पिछले 2 अक्‍तूबर को। 

हमारे देश के अलग-अलग राज्‍यों का Online Quiz Competition हो सकता है क्‍या? अगर गुजरात ने छत्‍तीसगढ़ के साथ MOU किया है एक भारत श्रेष्‍ठ भारत का, तो छत्‍तीसगढ़ के बच्‍चे Quiz Competition में गुजरात के पांच हजार सवालों का जवाब दें, गुजरात के बच्‍चे छत्‍तीसगढ़ के पांच हजार सवालों का जवाब दें, कितने District हैं, कितनी जातियां हैं, कैसी बोलियां हैं, कैसा खानपान है, कैसा पहनावा है, कौन सी वस्‍तु कहां पर है। आप देखिए कितना बड़ा Integration सहज रूप से होगा। और अगर वो बच्‍चा ऐसे दस राज्‍यों के Quiz Competition में धीरे धीरे करके भाग लेता है तो भारत के विषय में कितनी जानकारियां उसको होंगी। 

मैं चाहता हूं कि सभी राज्‍य अपने एक Quiz Bank बनाएं; दो हजार, पांच हजार, सात हजार Questions और Answers, हो सके तो जो संबंध हो उसका फोटोग्राफ; Online एक Platform तैयार करें और राज्‍य के साथ MOU हो, उस राज्‍य के बच्‍चों के बीच Speech Competition हो। 

इन दिनों हमने 15 अगस्‍त और 26 जनवरी को पुलिस बेड़े के लोगों को कहा है कि 26 जनवरी की परेड में एक राज्‍य के पुलिस बेड़े के लोग दूसरे राज्‍य में जाएं। उस राज्‍य के लोग परेड करते होंगे उसमें एक और राज्‍य का दस्‍ता भी होगा। ये चीजें हैं जो हमें एक-दूसरे को निकट लाती हैं। ये सहज करने वाले काम हैं और उस पर हम बल दे रहे हैं। एक भारत श्रेष्‍ठ भारत कार्यक्रम को भी सफल करने की दिशा में हम लोगों ने प्रयास करना चाहिए, और भारत इतनी विविधताओं से भरा हुआ है; हम अपने ही देश को अपने में समाहित करने के लिए एक बीड़ा उठा लें तो भी एक जिंदगी कम पड़ जाए इतना बड़ा विशाल देश है; इतनी विविधताओं से भरा हुआ देश है; और हर नई चीज जानेंगे तो खुशी होगी। 

जैसे मैंने एक काम कहा है एक भारत श्रेष्‍ठ भारत में, जैसे मान लीजिए है हरियाणा है तेलंगना के साथ होगा। क्‍या हरियाणा के हर स्‍कूल में तेलुगु भाषा के पांच गीत कंठस्‍थ हो सकते हैं? पांच गीत गाना आ सकता है? तेलंगना के लोगों को हरियाणा के पांच गीत आते हैं क्‍या? और ये मजा आएगा, उनको आनंद आएगा, ये कोई Extra मेहनत नहीं करनी पड़ेगी। सहज रूप से हम देश की विविधताओ को जानें-पहचानें और ये Tourism को भी बहुत बल देने वाला है। 

हमारी युवा शक्ति में एक चैतन्‍य भरने वाला काम है। भारत को जोड़ करके भारत को एक नई ऊंचाईयों पर ले जाने का अवसर है। एक चीज छोटी-सी क्‍यों न हो, लेकिन कितना बड़ा बदलाव ला सकती है ये इसमें हम देख सकते हैं। तो आप यहां तीन दिन चिंतन-मनन करने वाले हैं, इतनी दूर से आप आए हैं, मैं आशा करता हूं कि आप खास करके जो मंत्रिपरिषद के लोग आए हैं; वे जरूर बैठेंगे, अपने अनुभव का लाभ सब राज्‍यों को देंगे, अपने Vision का लाभ देंगे, और शाम को रेगिस्‍तान में जब जाएं; मेरा इस भूमि से बड़ा लगाव रहा है। मैं आपसे एक सलाह देना चाहता हूं, आज शाम को जब रेगिस्‍तान में आप जाएं जितना अंदर तक जा सकते हैं allow करें Security Forces तब वहां तक जाइए, लेकिन हो सके तो अपने साथियों को छोड़ करके 25, 50 कदम दूर कहीं, जा‍ करके दस मिनट खड़े रहिए, अकेले। उस विराट रूप को देखिए, उस नीले आसमान को देखिए, उस सफेद चद्दर को देखिए; शायद जीवन में ऐसा अनुभव बहुत Rare और हां दोस्‍तों में ही गप्‍पें मारते रहोगे तो फिर वो अनुभूति नहीं होगी। 15, 20 मिनट के लिए स्‍वत: सब लोग 20, 25 कदम दूर अकेले जा करके खड़े हो जाइए, आप जरूर एक नया अनुभव करेंगे, और उस अनुभव को सबके सामने जरूर बताएंगे। ये जगह ऐसी है कि जहां आज से दस साल पहले अगर जाना है तो तीन-तीन, चार-चार घंटे लगते थे रेगिस्‍तान में, आज आप शायद 50 मिनट, 60 मिनट में वहां पहुंच गए होंगे। 

भूकंप के बाद कितना परिवर्तन आता है वो आपने देखा है। और ये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का आखिरी गांव है जहां आप बैठे हैं। इसके बाद कोई जनसंख्‍या नहीं है। इस आखिरी गांव के आखिरी मुकाम पर आप भारत के भविष्‍य का चिंतन कर रहे हैं। भारत के Tourism को बढ़ावा देने के लिए चिंतन कर रहे हैं। भारत की युवा शक्ति को प्रेरणा देने के लिए कोई न कोई संकल्‍प करके उठने वाले हैं। 

मुझे विश्‍वास है कि आप लोगों का ये मंथन आने वाले दिनों में नीति-निर्धारण में बहुत बड़ी सकारात्‍मक भूमिका अदा करेगा। मेरी इस अवसर पर आपको बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं हैं। आप दो-तीन दिन जो चर्चा करने वाले हैं उसकी बहुत बारीकी से मैं हर चीज को देखने वाला हूं, क्‍योंकि मेरी ये रुचि का क्षेत्र है। 

और इस क्षेत्र में बहुत Potential है, हमें इसको आगे बढ़ाना है। तो मैं आप जो मेहनत करने वाले हैं, उसका पूरा फायदा मैं खुद उठाना चाहता हूं, तो मुझे ज्‍यादा से ज्‍यादा लाभ‍ मिले; ऐसा काम आप जरूर करेंगे। देश को तो लाभ मिले ऐसा काम करते ही हैं आप, लेकिन मेरा भी ज्ञानवर्द्धन होगा आपके इस अनुभव के द्वारा। तो मैं इसका इंतजार करता हूं। 

अब तो तीन दिन के आपके विचार-विमर्श से जो मंथन के अमृत निकलेगा उस अमृत के पान के लिए मैं भी प्रतीक्षा कर रहा हूं। मेरी आप सबको बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं हैं। मैं विजय रूपाणी जी और उनकी सारी टीम को भी बधाई देता हूं कि उन्‍होंने इसके लिए, क्‍योंकि उनके यहां Tourism का इतना Rush होता है तो बीच में से इस प्रकार से किसी Conference के लिए Tent वगैरा देना जरा उनको Economically थोड़ा दिक्‍कत देने वाला काम होता है लेकिन दे रहे हैं, लेकिन इसके कारण जरूर ये देशभर से लोग आए हैं तो ये आपके इस रणोत्‍सव का प्रचार भी करेंगे। हो सकता है कि आने वाले दिनों में इनकी तरफ से भी 50-50 लोग ज्‍यादा आना शुरू कर जाएं तो आपका एक Investment ही है। तो गुजरात सरकार को भी मैं बधाई देता हूं, अभिनंदन करता हूं उनका। 

धन्‍यवाद।

The Prime Minister said that India’s youth is giving strength to key programmes such as digital initiatives, and Swachh Bharat Mission. He suggested that each state should select a few destinations, create world class tourism infrastructure,  and draw the world there.

The Prime Minister urged the delegates assembled for the Conference to work towards implementing Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat, through various mutual initiatives between States.

Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Vijay Rupani, and Union Ministers of State (I/C) Shri Vijay Goel and Dr. Mahesh Sharma, were present on the occasion.

                A delegation comprising Muslim Ulemas, intellectuals, academicians and other eminent people called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today. The delegation congratulated the Prime Minister on the steps taken by the Union Government for inclusive growth, socio-economic and educational empowerment of all sections of the society including Minorities. 

The delegation was appreciative of the Saudi Government’s decision to increase the number of Haj pilgrims from India, and thanked the Prime Minister for having successfully pursued the same. 

The delegation, in one voice, supported wholeheartedly the campaign launched by the Prime Minister against corruption and black money. The delegation agreed that the fight against corruption will benefit the poor people including the Minorities the most. 

The delegation congratulated the Prime Minister for his efforts to strengthen relations with the countries across the world and said that today every Indian in every corner of the world is instilled with a sense of pride. 

Members of the delegation also praised the Prime Minister for his efforts towards Swachh Bharat. 

The Prime Minister said that youth in India has successfully resisted radicalization, which has affected several parts of the world today. He said that the credit for this must go to the long, shared heritage of our people; and added that it is now our collective responsibility to take this heritage forward. The Prime Minister said that the culture, traditions and social fabric of India will never allow the nefarious designs of the terrorists, or their sponsors, to succeed. The Prime Minister stressed on the importance of education and skill development, which is the key to gainful employment, and upliftment from poverty. 

Appreciating the Government of Saudi Arabia for its decision to increase the number of Haj pilgrims for India, the Prime Minister asserted that there is a positive image of Indian Muslims abroad. 

Members of the delegation included Imam Umer Ahmed Ilyasi (Chief Imam of India, All India Organisation of Imams of Mosques); Lt Gen (Retd) Zameeruddin Shah (Vice-Chancellor Aligarh Muslim University); MY Eqbal (Former Judge, Supreme Court of India); Talat Ahmed (Vice Chancellor, Jamia Millia Islamia), and Shahid Siddiqui (Urdu journalist). 

Union Minister of State for Minority Affairs (Independent Charge) & Parliamentary Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Union Minister of State for External Affairs Shri M.J. Akbar were also present on the occasion.

The Prime Minister said that the visit of British Prime Minister Theresa  May to India in November 2016 has put in place the framework necessary  to guide India-UK relations in the days to come. 

The Prime Minister appreciated the progress achieved in strengthening  the bilateral partnership in various sectors, especially Science &  Technology, Finance, and Defence & Security. 

The Prime Minister noted that the Indian diaspora in UK acts as a living  bridge between the two countries, and is a key driver of close  people-to-people relations, and hoped that both sides would continue to  work together to enhance these ties.

Mr. Jacques Audibert, Diplomatic Adviser to the French President, called on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.

The Prime Minister said that bilateral relations between India and  France have expanded from the triad of Defence, Space and Civil Nuclear  cooperation to encompass a broad range of sectors, especially  counter-terrorism, maritime security, and renewable energy. 

The Prime Minister recalled the establishment of International Solar  Alliance as a landmark achievement in global efforts against Climate  Change, and conveyed his appreciation for French support to this  initiative. 

The Prime Minister called for greater bilateral cooperation in Smart Cities, Urban Transport, and Infrastructure Development.

                Excellencies,
Distinguished guests,
Ladies & Gentlemen,

Today seems to be a day of speeches. Just a while ago we heard President Xi and Prime Minister May. Here I am with my words. Perhaps an overdose for some. Or a problem of plenty for 24/7 News Channels.

It is a great privilege to speak to you at the inauguration of the second edition of the Raisina Dialogue. Excellency Karzai Prime Minister Harper, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, it is a pleasure to see you in Delhi. Also, a warm welcome to all the guests. Over the next couple of days, you would hold numerous conversations on the state of the world around us. You would debate its certainty and prevailing flux; its conflicts and risks; its successes and opportunities; its past behaviours and likely prognosis; and its potential black swans and the New Normals. 

Friends,

In May 2014, the people of India also ushered in a New Normal. My fellow Indians spoke in one voice to entrust my government with a mandate for change. Change not just of attitudes but of mindsets. Change from a state of drift to one of purposeful actions. Change to take bold decisions. A mandate in which reform would not be enough unless it transforms our economy and society. A transformation that is embedded in the aspiration and optimism of India’s youth, and in the boundless energy of its millions. Every day at work, I draw on this sacred energy. Every day at work, my ‘to do list’ is guided by the constant drive to reform and transform India, for prosperity and security of all Indians.

Friends,

I am aware that India’s transformation is not separated from its external context. Our economic growth; the welfare of our farmers; the employment opportunities for our youth; our access to capital, technology, markets and resources; And, security of our nation all of them are deeply impacted by developments in the world. But, the reverse is also true.

The world needs India’s sustained rise, as much as India needs the world. Our desire to change our country has an indivisible link with the external world. It is, therefore, only natural that India’s choices at home and our international priorities form part of a seamless continuum. Firmly anchored in India’s transformational goals.

Friends,

India is pursuing its transformation in unsettled times, which is equally the result of human progress and violent turmoil. For multiple reasons and at multiple levels, the world is going through profound changes. Globally connected societies, digital opportunities, technology shifts, knowledge boom and innovation are leading the march of humanity. But, sluggish growth and economic volatility are also a sobering fact. Physical borders may be less relevant in this age of bits and bytes. But, walls within nations, a sentiment against trade and migration, and rising parochial and protectionist attitudes across the globe are also in stark evidence. The result, Globalization gains are at risk and economic gains are no longer easy to come by. Instability, violence, extremism, exclusion and transnational threats continue to proliferate in dangerous directions. And, non-state actors are significant contributors to the spread of such challenges. Institutions and architectures built for a different world, by a different world, are outdated. Posing a barrier to effective multilateralism. As the world begins to re-order itself a quarter century after the strategic clarity of the Cold War, the dust has not yet settled on what has replaced it. But, a couple of things are clear. The political and military power is diffused and distributed The multi-polarity of the world, and an increasingly multi-polar Asia, is a dominant fact today. And, we welcome it. 

Because, it captures the reality of the rise of many nations. It accepts that voices of many, not views of a few should shape the global agenda. Therefore, we need to guard against any instinct or inclination that promotes exclusion, especially in Asia. The focus of this conference on Multilaterism with Multipolarity is thus timely.

Friends,

We inhabit a strategically complex environment. In the broad sweep of history, the changing world is not necessarily a new situation. The crucial question is how do nations act in a situation where the frames of reference are shifting rapidly. Our choices and actions are based on the strength of our national power.

Our strategic intent is shaped by our civilizational ethos of:

· यथार्थवाद (realism),
· सह-अस्तित्व (co-existence)
· सहयोग (cooperation),तथा
· सहभागिता (partnership).

This finds expression in a clear and responsible articulation of our national interests. The prosperity of Indians, both at home and abroad, and security of our citizens are of paramount importance. But, self interest alone is neither in our culture nor in our behavior. Our actions and aspirations, capacities and human capital, democracy and demography,and strength and success. will continue to be an anchor for all round regional and global progress. Our economic and political rise represents a regional and global opportunity of great significance. It is a force for peace, a factor for stability and an engine for regional and global prosperity. 

For my government, this has meant a path of international engagement focused on: 

· Rebuilding connectivity, restoring bridges and rejoining India with our immediate and extended geographies. 

· Shaping relationships networked with India’s economic priorities. 

· Making India a human resource power to be reckoned with, by connecting our talented youth to global needs and opportunities. 

· Building development partnerships that extend from the islands of the Indian Ocean and Pacific to the islands of the Caribbean and from the great continent of Africa to the Americas. · Creating Indian narratives on global challenges.

· Helping re-configure re-invigorate and rebuild global institutions and organizations. · Spreading the benefits of India's civilizational legacies, including Yoga and Ayurveda, as a global good. Transformation, therefore, is not just a domestic focus. It encompasses our global agenda.

For me, Sab Ka Saath; Sab Ka Vikas is not just a vision for India. It is a belief for the whole world. And, it manifests itself several layers, multiple themes and different geographies. 

Let me turn to those that are closest to us in terms of geography and shared interests. We have seen a major shift towards our neighbours captured in our determined ""Neighbourhood-first"" approach. The people of South Asia are joined by blood, shared history, culture, and aspirations. The optimism of its youth seeks change, opportunities, progress and prosperity. A thriving well-connected and integrated neighbourhood is my dream. In the last two and half years, we have partnered with almost all our neighbours to bring the region together. Where necessary, we have shed the burdens of our past for the progressive future of our region. The result of our efforts is there to see.

In Afghanistan, despite distance and difficulties in transit, our partnership assists in reconstruction, by building institutions and capacities. In the backdrop, our security engagement has deepened. The completion of Afghanistan's Parliament building and the India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam are two shining examples of our dedication to forge developmental partnership. 

With Bangladesh, we have achieved greater convergence and political understanding, through connectivity and infrastructure projects, and significantly, the settlement of the land and maritime boundaries. 

In Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives, our overall engagement in infrastructure, connectivity, energy and development projects is a source of progress and stability in the region. 

My vision for our neighbourhood puts a premium on peaceful and harmonious ties with entire South Asia. That vision had led me to invite leaders of all SAARC nations, including Pakistan, for my swearing in. For this vision, I had also travelled to Lahore. But, India alone cannot walk the path of peace. It also has to be Pakistan's journey to make. Pakistan must walk away from terror if it wants to walk towards dialogue with India. 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Further west, we have redefined, in a short span of time, and despite uncertainty and conflict, our partnerships with Gulf and West Asia, including Saudi Arabia, U.A.E, Qatar and Iran. Next week, I will have the pleasure to host His Highness the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, as the Chief Guest at India’s Republic Day. We have not just focused on changing the perception. We have also changed the reality of our ties.

This has helped us protect and promote our security interests, nurture strong economic and energy ties and advance the material and social welfare of around 8 million Indians. In Central Asia too, we have built our ties on the edifice of shared history and culture to unlock new vistas of prosperous partnership. Our membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization provides a strong institutional link to our engagement with Central Asian nations. We have invested in all round prosperity of our Central Asian brothers and sisters. 

And, have brought about a successful reset to longstanding relationships in that region.To our east, our engagement with South East Asia is at the centre of our Act East Policy. We have built a close engagement with the institutional structures in the region such as the East Asia Summit. Our partnership with ASEAN and its member countries has served to enhance commerce, technology, investment, development, and security partnerships with the region. It has also advanced our broad strategic interests and stability in the region. In our engagement with China, as President Xi and I agreed, we have sought to tap the vast area of commercial and business opportunities in the relationship. I see the development of India and China as an unprecedented opportunity, for our two countries and for the whole world. At the same time, it is not unnatural for two large neighbouring powers to have some differences. In the management of our relationship, and for peace and progress in the region, both our countries need to show sensitivity and respect for each other's core concerns and interests. 

Friends,

Prevailing wisdom tells us that this century belongs to Asia. The sharpest trajectory of change is happening in Asia. There are large and vibrant pools of progress and prosperity that spread across the landscape of this region. But, rising ambition and rivalries are generating visible stress points. The steady increase in military power, resources and wealth in the Asia-Pacific has raised the stakes for its security. Therefore, the security architecture in the region must be open, transparent, balanced and inclusive. And, promote dialogue and predictable behavior rooted in international norms and respect for sovereignty.

Friends,

Over the past two and a half years, we have given a strong momentum to our engagement with the United States, Russia, Japan and other major global powers. With them, we not only share a desire to cooperate. We also hold converging views on opportunities and challenges that face us. These partnerships are a good fit with India's economic priorities and defence and security. With the United States, our actions have brought speed, substance and strength to the entire spectrum of our engagement. In my conversation with President-elect Donald Trump, we agreed to keep building on these gains in our strategic partnership. Russia is an abiding friend. President Putin and I have held long conversations on the challenges that confront the world today. Our trusted and strategic partnership, especially in the field of defence has deepened. 

Our investments in new drivers of our relationship, and the emphasis on energy, trade, and S&T linkages are showing successful results. We also enjoy a truly strategic partnership with Japan whose contours now stretch to all fields of economic activity. Prime Minister Abe and I have spoken of our determination to intensify our cooperation further. With Europe, we have a vision of strong partnership in India’s development, especially in knowledge industry and smart urbanization.

Friends,

India has for decades been at the forefront of sharing our capacities and strengths with fellow developing countries. With our brothers and sisters in Africa, we have further strengthened our ties in the last couple of years. And, built meaningful development partnerships on the solid foundation of decades of traditional friendship and historical links. Today, the footprint of our development partnership stretches all across the globe. 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

India has a long history of being a maritime nation. In all directions, our maritime interests are strategic and significant. The arc of influence of Indian Ocean extends well beyond its littoral limits. Our initiative of SAGAR - Security And Growth for All in the Region is not just limited to safe-guarding our mainland and islands. It defines our efforts to deepen economic and security cooperation in our maritime relationships. We know that convergence, cooperation, and collective action will advance economic activity and peace in our maritime region. We also believe, that the primary responsibility for peace, prosperity and security in the Indian Ocean rests with those who live in this region. Ours is not an exclusive approach. And, we aim to bring countries together on the basis of respect for international law. We believe that respecting Freedom of Navigation and adhering to international norms is essential for peace and economic growth in the larger and inter-linked marine geography of the Indo-Pacific.

Friends,

We appreciate the compelling logic of regional connectivity for peace, progress and prosperity. In our choices and through our actions, we have sought to overcome barriers to our outreach to West and Central Asia, and eastwards to Asia-Pacific. Two clear and successful examples of this are the tripartite agreement with Iran and Afghanistan on Chabahar; and our commitment to bring on line the International North South Transport Corridor. However, equally, connectivity in itself cannot override or undermine the sovereignty of other nations. 

Only by respecting the sovereignty of countries involved, can regional connectivity corridors fulfill their promise and avoid differences and discord.

Friends,

True to our traditions, we have shouldered the international burden of our commitments. We have led assistance and relief efforts in times of disaster. We were a credible first responder during the earthquake in Nepal, evacuation from Yemen and during humanitarian crises in the Maldives and Fiji. We have also not hesitated in shouldering our responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. We have increased collaboration on coastal surveillance, white shipping information and fighting non-traditional threats like piracy, smuggling and organized crime. We have also shaped alternative narratives on long standing global challenges. Our strong belief in delinking terrorism from religion, and rejecting artificial distinctions between good and bad terrorism, are now a global talking point. And, those in our neighbourhood who support violence, encourage hatred, and export terror stand isolated and ignored. On the other pressing challenge of global warming, we have moved into a leading role. We have an ambitious agenda and an equally aggressive target to generate 175 giga watts from renewable energy. And we have already made a good start. We have shared our civilizational traditions to promote harmonious living with nature. We also brought the international community together to create an International Solar Alliance, to harness the energy of sun to propel human growth. A high point of our efforts has been the revival of international interest in the cultural and spiritual richness of India’s civilizational stream. Today, Buddhism, yoga and Ayurveda are recognized as invaluable heritage of humanity as a whole. India will celebrate this common heritage every step of the way. As it builds bridges across countries and regions and promotes overall well-being.

Ladies & gentlemen,

In conclusion, let me say this. In connecting with the world, our ancient scriptures have guided us.

Rig Veda says, 

आ नो भद्रो : क्रत्वो यन्तु विश्वतः Means: ""Let noble thoughts come to me from all directions”.

As a society, we have always favoured needs of many over the want of one.And, preferred partnerships over polarization. We hold the belief that success of one must propel the growth of many. Our task is cut out. And, our vision is clear. Our journey of transformation begins at home. And, is strongly supported through our constructive and collaborative partnerships that span the globe. With resolute steps at home, and expanding network of reliable friendships abroad, we will grasp the promise of a future that belongs to over a billion Indians. And in this endeavor, you will find in India, my friends, a beacon of peace and progress, stability and success, and access and accommodation.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

                Dear Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam  ji, 

Shri N. Ravi, 

Shri  G. Viswanathan, 

Shri S. Rajnikanth, 

Shri Gurumurthy,   

Readers of Thuglak 

Admirers of late Shri. Cho Ramaswamy 

And the people of Tamil Nadu.

Vanakkam. Iniya Pongal nalvazhthukkal

We have gathered at a very auspicious time.

Yesterday my Telugu sisters and brothers celebrated the festival of Bhogi.

Friends in the northern part of India, especially Punjab marked Lohri.

Today is Makar Sankranti.

In Gujarat, the sky is fully of kites on this day, which is also known as Uttarayan. 

The people of Assam are celebrating Magh Bihu.

And in Tamil Nadu, where you are, it is Pongal.

Pongal is the festival of thankfulness - thanking the sun god, thanking the animals that help in agriculture and thanking nature for providing the natural resources that sustain us.

Harmony with nature is the strength of our culture, our traditions.

From north to south, east to west, we can see how there is a festive spirit across the nation. 

Festivals are celebrations of life. 

With festivals comes a spirit of togetherness. 

They weave a beautiful thread of unity.

My greetings to people across India on all these festivals.

Makar Sankranti marks the transition of the Sun into the zodiac sign of Makara Rashi on its celestialpath. For most people, Makar Sankranti means a break from the harrowing winter and warmer, brighter days.

Some of the festivals we celebrate today are harvest festivals.

We pray that these festivals bring prosperity and joy in the lives of our farmers, who work hard to keep our nation fed.

Friends.

I wish I could be present with you in person – but the exigencies of work did not so permit.  I pay my tribute to my dear friend Sri Cho Ramaswamy on the 47th anniversary of Thuglak.

In the passing away of Cho, we all have lost a friend who offered his invaluable wisdom to whoever came his way. 

I knew him personally for over four decades. It is a personal loss for me. 

He was one of the most multi-faceted personalities I have ever come across. He was an actor, a director, a journalist, an editor, a writer, a playwright, a politician, a political commentator, a cultural critic, a highly talented writer, a religious and social critic, a lawyer and so much more.

Of all his roles, his role as the editor of the Thuglak magazine was the jewel in the crown. For 47 years the Thuglak magazine played a stellar role in the cause of safeguarding democratic values and national interest.

Thuglak and Cho – it is difficult to imagine one without the other. For nearly five decades, he was in charge of Thuglak. If someone has to write the political history of India, he cannot write it without including Cho Ramaswamy and his political commentary.

It is easy to admire Cho, but it is not very easy to understand Cho. To understand him, one needs to understand his courage, conviction, his sense of nationalism which went beyond parochial, regional, linguistic and other divisions.

His greatest achievement is that he made Thuglak a weapon against all divisive forces. He was fighting for a clean and non-corrupt political system. In that struggle, he never spared anyone.

He was critical of those people with whom he had acted for decades, critical of those people who were friends with him for decades, critical of those people who considered him as his mentor. No one was spared. He did not look at the personalities but looked at the issues.

The Nation was his central message. This is reflected in his writings, in the movies, plays and television serials he directed, in the movies for which he wrote the screenplay.

His satire made his criticism loveable even to those he criticized. That is a not a cultivated or cultivable virtue. That was a gift from the divine to him, which he used only to promote public interest.   It was his gift also to communicate ideas in one cartoon or in one sentence which a book or volumes of books could not.

This reminds me of a cartoon by Cho wherein people are targeting me with their guns and the common people are standing in front of me; Cho asks who is the real target? Me or the common people? How apt is the cartoon in today’s context!

I am reminded of one incident related to Cho. Once some people annoyed with Cho started pelting eggs.  On this Cho said ""Aiyya, why throw raw eggs at me when you can make me an omelette."" The pelters started laughing. He had this incredible ability to mould conditions in his favour.

Thuglak was a platform for all. Cho would carry views contrary, even hostile to him, and even abusive of him in his own magazine. This made no one excluded in Thuglak. Even those he criticizedwould find their views carried with the same prominence as Cho’s in Thuglak. This is the truest democratic spirit in media and in public life.

In my opinion, his thought and contributions were not merely limited to Tamil milieu and Tamil people. He inspired many generations of aspiring journalists and politicians spanning many societies in India. 

And all of us know that Thuglak magazine was not a mere political commentary. It was the ears and eyes of millions of Tamil people. Cho, through Thuglak, was the connecting bridge between masses and rulers.

I am glad that Thuglak will continue its journey in objective journalism as envisaged by Cho. Those who have inherited the legacy of Thuglak have great responsibility on their shoulders. To be guidedby Cho’s vision and commitment will be a big challenge. Adherence to this vision will be a great service to the people of Tamil Nadu.

I wish Mr. Gurumurthy and his team all the very best in this endeavour. Knowing Gurumurthy ji, I am confident that he will be successful.

That Cho had mastered the art of satire, humour and irony need not be overstated.

I think we need more satire and humour. Humour brings happiness in our lives. Humour is the best healer.

The power of a smile or the power of laughter is more than the power of abuse or any other weapon. Humour builds bridges instead of breaking them.

And this is exactly what we require today- building bridges. Bridges between people.

Bridges between communities. Bridges between societies.

Humour brings out human creativity. We are living in an age where one speech or one event can create multiple memes, forwards.

Friends

I have participated in Thuglak’s annual readers' meet before, in person in Chennai.

Since you have a tradition at this event to play verses from the Shrimad Bhagwad Gita in Mr. Cho’s voice, let me end with a Shlok in Mr. Cho’s honour:

 

वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि।

तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णान्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही।

(The eternal does not move from place to place, but moves from one abode to another.)

Let us, together thank him for his contribution to the multiple fields he touched. Above all let us thank him for being the great Cho Ramaswamy - the one and only Cho.

 

*****

                Most respected Morari Bapu Ji, President of the Vivekananda Kendra Shri P Parmeshvaran Ji, My ministerial colleague Pon Radhakrishnan Ji , Swami Ji of the Vivekananda Ashram Chaitanyanand Ji, Balakrishna Ji, Bhanudas Ji, Vice President of the Vivekananda Kendra Nivedita Ji and my dear friends!
I would have loved to be in your midst but thanks to the power of technology, we are connected on this occasion. And, in any case, I am no guest but am a part of this family. I am one of your own.
12th January- this is no ordinary day. This is a day etched in history as a day when India was blessed with one of the greatest thinkers, a guiding light and a stalwart who took India’s message to the entire world. 
I offer my tributes to the revered Swami Vivekananda. He was a giant, whose powerful thoughts continue to shape several minds.
आज विवेकानंदपुरम में रामायण दर्शनम, भारत माता सदनम का लोकार्पण हो रहा है। हनुमानजी की 27 फीट ऊंची प्रतिमा की और वो भी एक ही पत्थर की बनी हुई स्थापित की जा रही है। आप लोगों ने इससे संबंधित जो वीडियो मुझे भेजा था, वो मैंने देखा है और इस वीडियो को देख कर मैं कह सकता हूं इसमें दिव्यता भी है-भव्यता भी है।
आज ही विवेकानंद केंद्र के संस्थापक स्वर्गीय एकनाथ रानडे जी के portrait का भी अनावरण हो रहा है। आप सभी को आज के इस आयोजन के लिए हृदय से बहुत बहुत बधाई देता हूं।
भाइयों और बहनों, आज आप लोग जिस स्थान पर हैं वह सामान्य स्थान नहीं है। यो भूमि इस राष्ट्र की तपोभूमि की तरह है। अगर हनुमान जी को अपना purpose of life मिला तो इसी धरती पर मिला। जब उन्हें जामवंत ने उनसे कहा था कि तुम्हारा तो जन्म ही भगवान श्री राम के कार्य के लिए हुआ है। इसी धरती पर मां पार्वती की कन्याकुमारी का उसको purpose of life मिला। यही वो धरती है जहां महान समाज सुधारक, संत थिरूवल्लूवर को दो हजार वर्ष पूर्व ज्ञान का अमृत मिला। यही वो धरती है जहां स्वामी विवेकानंद को भी जीवन का उद्देश्य प्राप्त हुआ। यहीं पर तप करने के बाद उन्हें जीवन का लक्ष्य और लक्ष्य प्राप्ति के लिए मार्ग दर्शन मिला था। यही वो जगह है जहां एकनाथ रानडे जी को भी अपने जीवन का, जीवन की जो यात्रा थी उसमें एक नया मोड़ मिला। एक नया लक्ष्य प्रस्थापित हुआ। उन्होंने अपना पूरा जीवन one life one mission के रूप में इसी कार्य के लिये आहुत कर दिया। इस पवित्र भूमि को इस तपो भूमि को मेरा सत् सत् वंदन है, मेरा नमन है। 
साल 2014 में जब हम एकनाथ रानडे जी के जन्म शताब्दी मना रहे थे, तब मैंने कहा था- कि ये अवसर युवाओं के मन को जगाने का है। हमारा भारत युवा है- वो दिव्य भी बने और भव्य भी बने। आज दुनिया भारत से दिव्यता की अनुभूति की अपेक्षा कर रही है और भारत का गरीब, दलित, पीड़ित, शोषित, वंचित ये भारत की भव्यता की अपेक्षा करता है। और विश्व के लिये दिव्यता तो देश के अंदर के लिये भव्यता और इन दोनों का मेल करके ही राष्ट्र निर्माण की दिशा में हमें आगे बढ़ना है। 
भाइयों बहनों, आज भारत दुनिया का सबसे young country है। युवा देश है। 80 करोड़ से ज्यादा जनसंख्या 35 वर्ष से कम age की है। स्वामी विवेकानंद आज हमारे बीच नहीं हैं साक्षात रूप में नहीं हैं लेकिन उनके विचारों में इतनी power है इतनी ताकत है इतनी प्रेरणा है कि देश के youth को संगठित करके nation building का रास्ता दिखा रही है।
एकनाथ रानडे जी ने युवाओं की इस शक्ति को एकजुट करने के लिए, विवेकानंद केंद्र और स्वामी विवेकानंद रॉक मेमोरियल की स्थापना की थी। एकनाथ रानडे जी कहते थे  कि हमें स्वामी विवेकानंद अच्छे लगते हैं सिर्फ इतने भर से कुछ नहीं होगा। देश के लिए स्वामी विवेकानंद ने जो कल्पना की है, उसे साकार करने के लिए वो सतत योगदान को भी important मानते थे।
एकनाथ जी ने जिस एक लक्ष्य के लिए पूरा जीवन लगा दिया था, वो था- स्वामी विवेकानंद जी जैसे युवकों का निर्माण। उन्होंने युवाओं में राष्ट्रनिर्माण के वही आदर्श स्थापित करने का हमेशा प्रयास किया, जो ethics जो Values स्वामी विवेकानंद जी के थे। मेरा ये बहुत बड़ा सौभाग्य रहा कि जीवन के अनेक वर्षों तक मुझे एकनाथ जी निकट के साथी के रूप में काम करने का अवसर मिला। इसी धरती पर कई बार आकर के उनके सानिध्य में जीवन को निखारने का मुझे अवसर मिलता था।  
एकनाथ जी के जन्मशती पर्व के दौरान ही तय हुआ था कि हमारे culture संस्कृति और हमारे thought process पर रामायण के प्रभाव को दर्शाती एक प्रदर्शनी शुरू की जाए। आज रामायण दर्शनम भव्य रूप में हम सभी के सामने है। और मुझे विश्वास है देश और दुनिया के जो यात्री रॉक मेमोरियल पर आते हैं। ये रामायण दर्शनम शायद उनको ज्यादा प्रेरित भी करेगा। प्रभावित भी करेगा। श्रीराम भारत के कण कण में हैं। जन जन के मन में हैं। और इसलिये जब हम श्रीराम के विषय में सोचते हैं, तो श्रीराम एक आदर्श पुत्र-भाई-पति,मित्र और आदर्श राजा थे। अयोध्या भी एक आदर्श नगर था तो रामराज्य एक आदर्श शासन व्यवस्था थी। इसलिए भगवान राम और उनके राज्य का आकर्षण समय-समय पर देश की महान शख्सियतों को अपने तरीके से रामायण की व्याख्या करने के लिए प्रेरित करता रहता है। इन व्याख्याओं की झलक अब रामायण दर्शनम में मिलेगी। 
महाकवि कम्बन ने कंब रामायणम में कौशल राज्य को एक सुशासित राज्य बताया है। उन्होंने तमिल में जो लिखा, मैं उसका अंग्रेजी में अनुवाद अगर करूं तो उन्होंने लिखा था-
None were generous in that land as
None was needy;
None seemed brave as none defied;
Truth was unnoticed as there were no liars;
No learning stood out as all were learned. 
Since no one in that City ever stopped learning
None was ignorant and none fully learned;
Since all alike had all the wealth
None was poor and none was rich.
 
ये कम्बन द्वारा रामराज्य का presentation है। महात्मा गांधी भी इन्हीं विशेषताओं की वजह से रामराज्य की बात करते थे। निश्चित तौर पर ये एक ऐसा शासन था, जहां व्यक्ति Person important नहीं होता, बल्कि Principle important  हुआ करते थे। 
गोस्वामी तुलसीदास ने भी रामचरितमानस में रामराज्य का विस्तार से वर्णन किया है। रामराज्य यानि जहां कोई गरीब ना हो, दुःखी ना हो, कोई किसी से घृणा ना करता हो, जहां सभी स्वस्थ और सुशिक्षित हों। जहां प्रकृति और मनुष्य के बीच तालमेल हो। उन्होंने लिखा है-
 
दैहिक दैविक भौतिक तापा, राम राज नहिं काहुहि व्यापा। 
सब नर करहिं परस्पर प्रीती, चलहिं स्वधर्म निरत श्रुति नीति। 
अल्पमृत्यु नहिं कवनिउ पीरा,  सब सुंदर सब बिरुज सरीरा। 
नहिं दरिद्र कोउ दुखी न दीना,  नहिं कोउ अबुध न लच्छन हीना। 
 
राम रावण को हरा कर बड़े नहीं बने। बल्कि राम तब राम बने जब उन्होंने उन लोगों को साथ लिया जव सर्वहारा थे। साधनहीन थे। उन्होंने उन लोगों का आत्म गौरव बहाल किया और उनमें विजय का विश्वास पैदा किया। भगवान राम के जीवन में उस भूमिका को स्वीकार नहीं किया जो उनके वंश द्वारा जो परम्पराएं थीं। एक एक वरों में कई बातें हमलोग जानते हैं। वो अयोध्या से बाहर निकले थे। अभी नगर की शरहद से भी बाहर नहीं निकले लेकिन पूरे विश्व को पूरी मानवता को अपने आप में समाहित करते हुए आदर्श क्या होता है मूल्य क्या होते हैं। मूल्यों के प्रति जीवन का समर्पण क्या होता है। उसे उन्होंने जीकर के दिखाया था। और इसलिये मैं समझता हूं कि ये रामाण दर्शनम ये अपने आप में विवेकानंदपुरम में एक प्रासंगिक और हम जानते हैं प्रगति के लिये समाज जितना सबल चाहिए राज्य भी सुराज्य होना चाहिए। 
जब रामजी को देखते हैं तो व्यक्ति का विकास, व्यवस्था का विकास ये बातें सहज रूप से नजर आती हैं। 
भाइयों बहनों, एकनाथजी भी हमेशा चाहते थे कि देश की spiritual power को जगाकर देश की कर्मशक्ति  या working power को constructive कार्यों में लगाया जाए। आज जब विवेकानंद केंद्र में हनुमान जी की मूर्ति की स्थापना हो रही है, तो उनके इस कथन की inspiration का भी पता चलता है। 
हनुमान जी यानी सेवा, हनुमान जी यानी समर्पण भक्ति का वो रूप था। जिसमें सेवा ही परम धर्म बन गया था। जब वो समुद्र को पार कर रहे थे तो मैनाक पर्वत उन्हें बीच में विश्राम देना चाहता था। लेकिन संकल्प सिद्धि से पहले हनुमान जी के लिए शिथिलता की कोई गुंजाइश नहीं थी। अपने लक्ष्य की प्राप्ति तक उन्होंने आराम नहीं किया। 
हनुमान जी के सेवाभाव पर भारत रत्न सी राजगोपालाचारी जी ने भी अपनी रामायण में लिखा है। जब हनुमानजी सीता माता से मिलकर वापस लौटते हैं, भगवान राम जी को माता के सकुशल होने की बात बताते हैं, तो राम जी कहते हैं- 
""The deed done by Hanumaan none else in the world could even conceive of attempting-crossing the sea, entering Lanka protected by Raavana and his formidable hosts and accomplishing the task set him by his king not only fully but beyond the fondest hopes of all.""
राज जी  कहा है कि हनुमान जी ने वो काम किया था, जिसकी कोई उम्मीद तक नहीं कर रहा था। कठिनाइयों के जिस समंदर को हनुमान जी ने पार किया था, वो कोई सोच भी नहीं सकता था। 
और इसलिये भाइयों बहनों, हम भी जब सबका साथ सबका विकास ये Guiding Principal पर चल रहे हैं। चाहे गरीब से गरीब व्यक्ति के लिये जनधन योजना के जरिये गरीबों को बैंकिंग व्यवस्था के साथ जोड़ा जाए आज गरीब के पास एक व्यवस्था कर के हमने आगे बढ़ने का प्रयास किया था। और इसलिये बीमा कराने का विकल्प है। किसानों को इसका लाभ मिला है। किसानों को सबसे कम प्रीमियम पर फसल बीमा योजना दी गई है। बेटियों को बचाने के लिए उन्हें पढ़ाने के लिये अभियान चला रहे बेटी बचाओ बेटी पढ़ाओ। गर्भवती महिलाओं को आर्थिक मदद के लिये देशव्यापी योजना बनाई गई है। 5 करोड़ परिवार जो लकड़ी का चूल्हा जलाकर माताएं खाना पकाती थीं। और एक दिन में चार सौ सिगरेट का धुंआ खाना पकाने से लड़की के चूल्हे से उस मां के शरीर में जाता था। उन माताओं को अच्छा स्वास्थ्य मिले। प्राथमिक सुविधा मिले। 5 करोड़ परिवारों में gas connection का बीड़ा उठाया और डेढ़ करोड़ दे चुके हैं। 
 
दलित, पीड़ित, वंचित की सेवा यही तो जन सेवा प्रभु सेवा का मंत्र देती है। हमारे देश के दलित नौजवानों को stand-up india, start-up india के जरिए empower किया जा रहा है। छोटे कारोबारियों को कम ब्याज पर कर्ज मिल सके, इसलिए मुद्रा योजना चलाई गई है। गरीब की गरीबी तभी दूर होगी जब उसे empower किया जाए। जब गरीब सशक्त होगा, तो स्वयं गरीबी को प्रास्त करके रहेगा। और गरीबी से मुक्ति का वो आनन्द लेगा और एक नई ताकत के साथ वो आगे बढ़ेगा। 
रामायण में जब भगवान राम और भरत के बीच शासन को लेकर संवाद हो रहा था तब भगवान राम ने भरत से कहा था-
कच्चिद् अर्थम् विनिश्चित्य लघु मूलम् महा उदयम् |
क्षिप्रम् आरभसे कर्तुम् न दीर्घयसि राघव ||
यानि- हे भरत, ऐसी योजनाएं लागू करो जिनसे कम से कम व्यय में ज्यादा से ज्यादा लोगों का फायदा हो। रामजी ने भरत से ये भी कहा कि इन योजनाओं को लागू करने में बिल्कुल भी देरी ना की जाए।
आयः ते विपुलः कच्चित् कच्चिद् अल्पतरो व्ययः |
अपात्रेषु न ते कच्चित् कोशो गग्च्छति राघव ||
यानि भरत, इस बात का ध्यान रखना की आय ज्यादा हो और खर्च कम। वो इस बात की भी हिदायत देते हैं कि अपात्रों या undeserving को राज्य कोष का फायदा ना मिले। 
अपात्रों से सरकारी खजाने को बचाना भी सरकार की कार्यसंस्कृति का हिस्सा है। आपने देखा होगा हमने आधार कार्ड से लिंक करके बैंक अकाउंट में सीधे आर्थिक सहायता ट्रांसफर करना, फर्जी राशनकार्ड वालों को हटाना, फर्जी गैस कनेक्शन वालों को हटाना, फर्जी टीचरों को हटाना, दूसरों का अधिकार छीनने वालों को हटाना, ये सब इस सरकार ने मिशन मोड में लिया है।
 
भाइयों बहनों, आज ही भारतमाता सदन में पंचलौह से बनी मां भारती की प्रतिमा का अनावरण भी हो रहा है। मां भारती के इस प्रतीक का लोकार्पण सौभाग्य की बात है। जो भी व्यक्तिगण इस विशेष यज्ञ में जुटे थे, उन सभी का मैं इस पुण्य कार्य के लिए अभिवादन करता हूं।
साथियों, मैं विवेकानंद रॉक मेमोरियल के समीप बनी संत थिरूवल्लूवर की प्रतिमा को भी प्रणाम कर रहा हूं। थिरूवल्लूवर जो सूत्रवाक्य, जो मंत्र दे गए थे, वो आज भी उतने ही सटीक हैं, relevant हैं। नौजवानों के लिए उनकी सीख थी-
“In sandy soil, when deep you delve, you reach the springs below; The more you learn, the freer streams of wisdom flow.” 
यानि रेतीली धरती में जितना गहरा आप खोदते जाएंगे, एक दिन पानी तक जरूर पहुंचेंगे। ठीक वैसे ही जैसे आप जितना ज्यादा सीखते जाएंगे एक दिन ज्ञान की, बुद्धिमत्ता की गंगा तक अवश्य पहुंचेंगे।
आज युवा दिवस पर मेरा देश के नौजवानों से आह्वान है- सीखने की इस प्रक्रिया को, learning के process को कभी मत रुकने दीजिए। अपने भीतर के इस विद्यार्थी को कभी मरने मत दीजिये। जितना आप सीखेंगे, जितनी आप अपनी spiritual power को develop करेंगे, जितना आप अपनी skills को develop करेंगे, उतना ही आप का भी विकास होगा और देश का भी। 
कुछ लोग spiritual power की जब बात आती है तो उसको समझ नहीं पाते हैं उसको पंथ के दायरे में देखते हैं। लेकिन spiritual power ये पंथ से परा है बंधनों से परा है। इसका सीधा संबंध मानवीय मूल्यों से है। दैविक शक्ति से है। हमारे पूर्व राष्ट्रपति और इसी धरती के सपूत डॉक्टर ए पी जे अब्दुल कलाम कहा करते थे-
 
“Spirituality to me is the way we relate to God and the Divine. Staying connected with our spiritual life keep us grounded and always be reminded of the value of life and important values such as honesty, loving our neighbours, and many other important traits that will make the workplace a positive environment”. 
मुझे खुशी है कि पिछले कई दशकों से विवेकानंद केंद्र इसी दिशा में प्रयास भी कर रहा है। आज विवेकानंद केंद्र की दो सौ से ज्यादा ब्रांच हैं। देशभर में 800 से ज्यादा जगहों पर केंद्र के प्रोजेक्ट चल रहे हैं। स्वास्थ्य, शिक्षा, ग्रामीण भारत और संस्कृति जैसे महत्वपूर्ण क्षेत्रों में लगातार काम कर रहा है।
पटना से लेकर पोर्ट ब्लेयर तक, अरुणाचल प्रदेश के कार्बी आंग्लांग से लेकर कश्मीर के अनंतनाग तक, रामेश्वरम से लेकर राजकोट तक उसकी उपस्थिति है। दूर-दराज वाले इलाको में लगभग 28 हजार छात्रों को इस केंद्र के जरिए शिक्षा दी जा रही है। 
मैं विशेष तौर पर उत्तर पूर्व के राज्यों में विवेकानंद केंद्र के कार्यों की सराहना करना चाहूंगा। एकनाथ जी के रहते ही अरुणाचल प्रदेश में 7 रिहाइशी स्कूल खुले थे। आज उत्तर पूर्व में 50 से ज्यादा जगहों पर विवेकानंद केंद्र सामाजिक कार्यों से जुड़ा है। 
अनगिनत छात्र, आईआईटी स्टूडेंट, डॉक्टर और कई प्रोफेशनल्स स्वेच्छा से विवेकानंद केंद्रों में सेवाव्रती के तौर पर काम करते हैं। इसके लिए उन्हें किसी प्रकार की सैलरी नहीं दी जाती, बल्कि यह सब सेवा भाव से किया जाता है। मैं मानता हूँ कि निःस्वार्थ भाव से समाज की सेवा के लिए ये सेवाव्रती हम सभी के लिए प्रेरणा हैं। सामान्य जीवन को जीते हुए समाज सेवा का आदर्श उदाहरण है। देश के युवाओं के लिए एक दिशा है, एक मार्ग है।
विवेकानंद केंद्र से जुड़े लोग आज राष्ट्र निर्माण में अपना महत्वपूर्ण योगदान दे रहे हैं। मुझे उम्मीद है कि ये केंद्र आने वाली पीढ़ियों में इसी तरह नए विवेकानंद का निर्माण करता रहेगा। 
आज हर वो व्यक्ति जो राष्ट्र निर्माण में pro-active होकर अपनी duty निभा रहा है, वो विवेकानंद है। हर वो व्यक्ति जो दलित-पीड़ित-शोषित और वंचितों के development के लिए काम कर रहा है, वो विवेकानंद है। हर वो व्यक्ति जो अपनी energy को, अपने ideas, अपने innovation को समाज के हित में लगा रहा है, वो विवेकानंद है। 
आप सभी जिस मिशन में जुटे हैं, वो मानवता के लिए, हमारे समाज के लिए, हमारे देश के लिए एक बड़ी तपस्या की तरह है। आप ऐसे ही भाव से देश की सेवा करते रहें, यही कामना है।
 

विवेकानंद जी के जन्मदिवस पर, युवा दिवस पर आप सभी को एक बार फिर बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं। बापू को मेरा जय श्रीराम, और वहां परमेश्वरम जी वगैरह सब को नमन करते हुए मैं मेरी वाणी को विराम देता हूं। और मुझे विश्वास है जैसा मुझे निमंत्रण दिया गया कन्याकुमारी आने के लिये। मेरा अपना घर है ये। देखता हूं कब मौका मिलता है दौड़ता रहता हूं। दौड़ते – दौड़ते कभी एकाद बार बीच में मौका मिल जाएगा। मैं जरूर वहां उस धरती को नमन करने के लिये आ जाऊंगा। आपके बीच कुछ समय बिताऊंगा। मुझे इस अवसर पर मैं वहां रुबरू नहीं आ सका इसका खेद है लेकिन फिर भी दूर से सही। यहां दिल्ली में ठंड है वहां गर्मी है। इन दो के बीच हम नई ऊर्जा और उमंग के साथ आगे बढ़ेंगे। इसी विश्वास के साथ आप सब को इस पावन पर्व पर बहुत बहुत शुभकामनाएं। बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद।

12th January- this is no ordinary day. This is a day etched in history as a day when India was blessed with one of the greatest thinkers, a guiding light and a stalwart who took India’s message to the entire world.

I offer my tributes to the revered Swami Vivekananda. He was a giant, whose powerful thoughts continue to shape several minds.

Today, Ramaayan Darshanam and Bharat Mata Sadanam in Vivekanandpuram are being dedicated to the public. Twenty seven feet tall statue of Hanuman Ji that is carved out of a single stone is being installed here. I have seen the video related to it that was sent to me by you people. And after having seen the video I can say that the statue has both divinity and splendor.

The portrait of the founder of Vivekanand Kendra Late Eknath Ranade is also getting inaugurated today. I heartily congratulate all of you for today’s event.

Brothers and sisters, that place is not an ordinary place where you are present today. This land is like a holy land of this country. If Hanuman Ji got his purpose of life then he got it at this place only when Jamwant told him that the only purpose of his birth was to do the work of Lord Shri Ram. On this land, mother Parvati, Kanyakumari got her purpose in life. This is the land where great social reformer saint Thiruvalluvar got the Amrit of knowledge two thousand years ago. This is the land where Swami Vivekananda too got his purpose in life. He got to know about his purpose of life and also got the guidance to fulfill his purpose in life after doing meditation here. This is the place where Eknath Ranade got a new turn of his life, got a new turn in his journey of life. A new goal was set. He sacrificed his entire life to accomplish this thing under one life one mission mode. I bow down to this pious land, this holy land thousand times.

When we were celebrating the birth centenary of Eknath Ranade Ji then I had said that it was the time to awake the youths. Our India is young, it should become divine and glorious. Today, the world is looking at India to experience the divinity and India’s poor, India’s oppressed, persecuted, exploited and disadvantaged masses are expecting splendor for the country. We have to move forward in the direction of building the nation by combining the two – divinity for the world and splendor for the country.

Brothers and sisters, today India is the youngest country in the world. It’s an young country. More than 800 million people are below the age of 35 years. Today, Swami Vivekanand is not amongst us, not in the human form but his ideas are so powerful, so inspirational that it shows the path of nation building by galvanizing the youth.

Eknath Ranade ji had established Vivekanand Kendra and Swami Vivekanand Rock Memorial to galvanise this strength of the youth. Eknath Ranade Ji used to say that just having a fondness for Swami Vivekanand would not change anything. He considered the regular contribution to realize the country of the dreams of Swami Vivekanand very important.

It was the goal of development of youths like Vivekanad Ji for which Eknath Ji dedicated his entire life. He always tried to inculcate the same values and ethics of the nation building in the youth that were held by Swami Vivekanand Ji.  It’s my great fortune that I got the opportunity to work as a close associate of Eknath Ji for several years. I got several opportunities to improve my life in his company on this land only.

It was decided on the occasion of the birth centenary of Eknath Ranade to start an exhibition depicting the influence of Ramayana on our culture and our thought process. And today Ramayan Darshnam is before us in a very glorified way. And I’m confident that those domestic and foreign travelers who come to visit the Rock Memorial, this Ramayan Darshanam would greatly inspire them, and influence them. Shri Ram is present in every single speck of the country. He is present in everyone’s mind. And therefore when we think of Shri Ram then Shri Ram was an ideal son, ideal brother, ideal husband, ideal friend and he was an ideal ruler. Ayodhya was an ideal city and Ram Rajya (the rein of the Lord Ram) was an ideal system of governance that is why the Lord Ram and the attraction of his kingdom keeps inspiring the great souls of the country from time to time to explain Ramayana in their own ways. These exegesis will be reflected in Ramayana Darshanam.

Great poet Kamban had described the kigdom of Koshal as a well governed state in the Kamb Ramayanam. I would like to translate in English what he has written in Tamil :

None were generous in that land as

None was needy;

None seemed brave as none defied;

Truth was unnoticed as there were no liars;

No learning stood out as all were learned.

Since no one in that City ever stopped learning

None was ignorant and none fully learned;

Since all alike had all the wealth

None was poor and none was rich.

 This is how Kamban presented the Ram Rajya (Reign of Lord Ram). Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about Ram Rajya due to these virtues only. It was certainly a system in which person was not important but the principles were important.

Goswami Tulsidas has described the Ram Rajya in a detail manner in Ramcharit Manas. Ram Rajya means where there is no one poor, no one is sorrowful, no one hates anyone, where everyone is healthy and well learned. Where there is a balance between the nature and the man. He has written -

दैहिक दैविक भौतिक तापा, राम राज नहिं काहुहि व्यापा।

सब नर करहिं परस्पर प्रीती, चलहिं स्वधर्म निरत श्रुति नीति।

अल्पमृत्यु नहिं कवनिउ पीरा,  सब सुंदर सब बिरुज सरीरा।

नहिं दरिद्र कोउ दुखी न दीना,  नहिं कोउ अबुध न लच्छन हीना।

Ram did not become great by conquering Ravan. Ram only emerged in his true spirit when he took along with him as his trueself when he took along the poorest of the poor, people without any means with him. He restored their sense of self pride in them and instilled a sense of victory in them. Lord Ram did not accept that role in his life as was ordained by his lineage. We come to know about several things in each couplet. When he came out of Ayodhya, even before coming out the boundary of the city, by encompassing the whole world, whole humanity in him, he set the live example through his life that what are the ideals, what the values are and what it means to dedicate one’s life to those values.

And that’s why I think that this Ramayan Darshanam in Vivekanandpuram is very relevant in itself and all of us know that for the progress a strong society is needed and the governance should be good governance.

When we think of Ram Ji then the development of man, development of the system are reflected naturally.

Brothers and sisters, Eknath Ji also always wanted to deploy the country’s working power in constructive work by awakening its spiritual power. And today when the statue of Hanuman Ji is being installed at Vivekanand Kendra then we understand the inspiration of his this statement.

Hanuman Ji means self-less service, Hanuman Ji was that form of dedication and devotion in which self-less service had become the ultimate goal. When he was flying over the sea then the Mainak Mountain offered him to provide rest in the middle but for Hanuman Ji there was no scope for complacency before achieving his goal. He did not rest till the time he achieved his goal.

Bharat Ratna C. Rajgopalachari had written about Hanuman Ji’s devotion to the self-less service. When Hanuman Ji returns after meeting goddess Sita and he informs Lord Ram about the wellbeing of the mother goddess then Ram Ji says:

""The deed done by Hanumaan none else in the world could even conceive of attempting-crossing the sea, entering Lanka protected by Raavana and his formidable hosts and accomplishing the task set him by his king not only fully but beyond the fondest hopes of all.""

Ram Ji says that no one could hope for what Hanuman Ji had accomplished. Nobody could think of the sea of difficulties that Hanuman Ji had crossed.

And brothers and sisters that is why we are walking on the path of the guiding principle of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas.

Be it Jan Dhan scheme for connecting the poorest of the poor with the banking system, today we have tried to move ahead by developing a system for the poor. And there is an option for insurance. Farmers have taken advantage of it. Farmers have been provided the crop insurance scheme at the lowest premium. We have been running Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme in order to protect, to provide education to daughters. A nationwide scheme has been developed to provide financial assistance to pregnant women. Fifty million families, the mothers who used wood based stove for cooking food and in one day they used to inhale the smoke equal to smoking 400 cigarettes, in order to provide good health, primary care to these mothers we have resolved to provide gas connections to 50 million families and we have already provided 15 million gas connections.

The service to the oppressed, to the persecuted, to the disadvantaged gives us the formula that ‘serving the people is equal to the serving the god’. The Dalit youth of country have been empowered through stand up India, start up India. Mudra scheme has been launched in order to provide small businessmen loans at affordable rates. Poverty can only be eradicated by empowering the poor people. When the poor people are strengthened then he himself will ultimately succeed in eradicating the poverty. And he will enjoy the freedom from poverty and he will move ahead with a new strength.

In Ramayana, when there was a discourse between the Lord Ram and Bharat over the issue of governance then Lord Ram told Bharat:

कच्चिद् अर्थम् विनिश्चित्य लघु मूलम् महा उदयम् |

क्षिप्रम् आरभसे कर्तुम् न दीर्घयसि राघव ||

It means: Ram told Bharat to implement such schemes that will benefit the maximum number of people in the least expenditure. He also told Bharat not to brook any delay in implementing those schemes.

आयः ते विपुलः कच्चित् कच्चिद् अल्पतरो व्ययः |

अपात्रेषु न ते कच्चित् कोशो गग्च्छति राघव ||

Lord Ram also instructs Bharat to keep this thing in mind that the income must exceed the expenditure. He also instructs that undeserving should not get the benefit of the exchequer.

Saving the public money from undeserving people is also a part of the government culture. You would have seen that we have linked Aadhaar cards with bank accounts for the direct transfer of benefit, removal of fake ration cards, removal of fake gas connection holders, removal of fake teachers, removal of people who misappropriate others’ rights, this government has taken all these initiatives in the mission mode.

Brothers and sisters, today, the statue of mother India that is made of five irons is being dedicated to the public in Bharat Mata Sadan. The public dedication of this symbol of mother India is very auspicious thing. I bow down to all those people who have been associated with, who have dedicated themselves for this novel work.

Friends, I also bow down to the statue of saint Thiruvalluvar installed near the Vivekananda Rock Memorial. The teachings of saint Thiruvalluvar are completely correct and relevant even today. For the youth his message was- “In sandy soil, when deep you delve, you reach the springs below; The more you learn, the freer streams of wisdom flow.”

It means: if you keep digging deeper in the desert land, one day you will certainly find the water. Similarly, if you keep learning more and more, then one day you will certainly find the wisdom.

 Today, on the occasion of youth day, my appeal to the youth of our country is to never stop the process of learning. Never ever let the student inside you die. The more you learn, the more you develop your spiritual power, your skills, the country and you will develop as much.

Some people fail to understand what the spiritual power means? They see it through the prism of religion. However, the spiritual power is beyond the religion. It is directly related to human values and to the divine power. Our former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, a great son of this land, used to say:

“Spirituality to me is the way we relate to God and the Divine. Staying connected with our spiritual life keeps us grounded and always be reminded of the value of life and important values such as honesty, loving our neighbors, and many other important traits that will make the workplace a positive environment”.

I’m happy that Vivekananda Kendra is working in the direction from several decades. Today, the Vivekanand Kendra has more than 200 branches and the Kendra has been running projects at more than 800 locations in the country. It is consistently working in the important fields of health, education, rural India and culture.

It is present in from Patna to Port Blair, from Karbi Anglong in Arunachal Pradesh to Anantnag in Kashmir, from Rameshwaram to Rajkot. I’d like to specially appreciate the work Vivekanand Kendra in the North Eastern states. Seven residential schools were opened in Arunachal Pradesh during the lifetime of Eknath Ji. Today, Vivekanand Kendra is associated with social work in more than 50 locations in the North East.

Numerous students, IIT students, doctors and professionals have been working at Vivekananda Kendra as volunteers. No salary is paid to them for this thing and all these things are done with a sense of duty.  I believe that these volunteers who serve the society without any self-interest are a source of inspiration for all of us. They are an ideal example of service to the society while leading an ordinary life.  They are in a way a direction, a guidance to the country’s youth.

Today, people associated with Vivekanand Kendra have playing a major role in nation building. I’m hopeful that the Kendra will continue to produce Vivekanands in the future generations in the similar manner.

Today, every single person who has been pro-actively fulfilling his duty in nation building is like Vivekananda. Every such person who has been working for the development of the disadvantaged, of the oppressed, of the exploited and of the persecuted is like Vivekanand. Every such person who has been putting his energy, his ideas or innovation in the service of society, he is like Vivekanand.

The mission that all of you are engaged in is like a Tapasya for the humanity, for our society, for our country. I wish that you people continue to serve the country with the same feelings.

Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Vivekanand Ji, on the occasion of youth day. I say Jai Shri Ram to Bapu, I would like to conclude here by bowing down to Parmeshwaram Ji and others. And I believe that the way I was invited to come to Kanyakumari, it’s like my home, let’s see when I get the next opportunity. I keep running here and there, and I’m hopeful that I’d get some chance to come here in the middle of all this hustle and bustle. I will certainly come to offer my respect to that land, I will spend time with you people. I regret that I could not come there in person in this occasion. It’s cold here in Delhi and it’s hot there. Between the two, we will move ahead with new energy, new enthusiasm. With this feeling, I convey my best wishes to all of you on this holy occasion. Thank you very much.

                मंचस्थ सभी गण्यमान्य अतिथि और मेरे प्यारे नौजवान दोस्तों, आप सभी को 21वें राष्ट्रीय युवा महोत्सव की बहुत-बहुत बधाई। समय की कमी की वजह से मैं रोहतक में खुद मौजूद नहीं हूं लेकिन मैं जो तस्वीरें देख पा रहा हूं, उससे लग रहा है कि जैसे आज ये महोत्सव भी 21 वर्ष का युवा हो गया है। देश के अलग-अलग कोने से आए मेरे नौजवान साथियों के चेहरे पर इतनी ऊर्जा दिखाई दे रही है, जैसे आज रोहतक में युवा महोत्सव के साथ ही प्रकाश महोत्सव भी मनाया जा रहा है।

आज राष्ट्रीय युवा दिवस है। स्वामी विवेकानंद जी की जन्मजयंती। मैं आप सभी के माध्यम से देश के हर नौजवान को इस विशेष दिन की बहुत बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। स्वामी विवेकानंद इस बात का सबसे उत्तम उदाहरण हैं कि अल्‍प अवधि में भी कितना कुछ हासिल किया जा सकता है। उनका जीवन बहुत कम समय का था। स्वामी विवेकानंद युवा शक्ति के असीम प्रेरक हैं। स्वामी विवेकानंद कहते थे- हमारे देश को इस समय आवश्यकता है लोहे की तरह ठोस मांसपेशियों और मजबूत स्नायुवाले शरीरों की। आवश्यकता है इस तरह की दृढ़ इच्छा-शक्ति-संपन्न युवाओं की।

स्वामी विवेकानंद ऐसे युवाओं का निर्माण करना चाहते थे जिनमें बिना भेद-भाव के एक दूसरे के प्रति प्रेम व विश्वास हो। युवा वह होता है, जो बिना अतीत की चिंता किए अपने भविष्‍य के लक्ष्‍यों की दिशा में काम करता है। आप सभी युवा जो काम आज करते हैं, वही तो कल जाकर देश का भविष्य बन जाता है।

साथियों, आज देश के 80 करोड़ से ज्यादा लोगों की आयु इस समय 35 वर्ष से कम है। स्वामी विवेकानंद के बताए मार्ग पर चलकर के आज भारत में एक ऐसे युग की शुरुआत करने की क्षमता है, जो विश्वगुरू बन सकता है।

आज मेरे जो नौजवान साथी इस वक्त रोहतक में हैं, उनके लिए हरियाणा की ये धरती भी बहुत प्रेरणादाई है। हरियाणा की ये धरती वेदों की है, उपनिषदों की है, गीता की है। ये वीरों की कर्म वीरों की है, जय जवान-जय किसान की धरती है। ये सरस्वती की पावन धरा है। अपनी संस्कृति, अपने मूल्यों को सहेजकर आगे बढ़ने का लगातार प्रयास, ये इस धरती से सीखा जा सकता है।

मुझे खुशी है कि इस बार राष्ट्रीय युवा महोत्सव की THEME है- YOUTH FOR DIGITAL INDIA...। इस महोत्सव के माध्यम से युवाओं को रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी में डिजिटल तरीके से लेन-देन की ट्रेनिंग दी जाएगी। मेरी इस महोत्सव में ट्रेनिंग लेने वाले हर युवा से अपील है कि जब वो यहां से ट्रेनिंग लेकर जाएं तो अपने आसपास के कम से कम 10 परिवारों को डिजिटल ट्रांजेक्शन करना सिखाएं। LESSCASH  अर्थव्यवस्था बनाने में आप सभी युवाओं की बहुत बड़ी भूमिका है। देश को कालेधन और भ्रष्टाचार से मुक्त कराने की लड़ाई में ये आप लोगों का महत्वपूर्ण योगदान होगा।

इस वर्ष राष्ट्रीय युवा महोत्सव का शुभांकर बेटी के रूप में चुना गया है। दुलार से इसे नाम दिया गया है ‘‘म्हारी लाडो’’। इस महोत्सव के माध्यम से ‘‘बेटी बचाओ- बेटी पढ़ाओ’’ अभियान के बारे में जागरूकता बढ़ाने का प्रयास बहुत ही सराहनीय है। हरियाणा से ही केंद्र सरकार ने ‘‘बेटी बचाओ- बेटी पढ़ाओ’’ अभियान की शुरुआत की थी। इस अभियान का इस क्षेत्र में बड़ा असर दिख रहा है। बदलाव की शुरुआत हुई है। SEX RATIO में काफी बदलाव आया है। पूरे देश के लिये ये बदलाव बढ़ रहा है। मैं हरियाणा के लोगों को इसके लिए खास तौर पर बधाई देता हूं। ये दर्शाता है कि जब लोग ठान लेते हैं तो असंभव भी संभव हो जाता है। मुझे उम्मीद है कि जल्द ही पूरे देश के लिये गौरवपूर्ण स्थिति हरियाणा निर्माण करके दिखाएगा।

हरियाणा के भविष्य को संवारने में यहाँ का युवा वर्ग एक बड़ी भूमिका निभा रहा है। हरियाणा के युवा खिलाड़ियों ने अनेक अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्पर्धाओं में पदक हासिल कर सदा-सर्वदा पूरे देश का मान बढ़ाया है।

पूरे देश में विकास की नई बुलंदियों को छूने के लिए युवा शक्ति के और अधिक योगदान की आवश्यकता है। भारत का लक्ष्‍य अपने युवकों को, इस सदी को भारत की सदी बनाने के लिए क्षमताएं एवं कौशल प्रदान करना है।

दोस्तों, राष्ट्रीय युवा महोत्सव आप सभी को अपनी प्रतिभा के प्रर्दशन के लिए एक मंच प्रदान करता है। अलग-अलग सांस्कृतिक परिवेश से आए हुए आप सभी नौजवानों को यहां एक दूसरे को जानने का समझने का मौका मिलेगा। यही तो एक भारत-श्रेष्ठ भारत का वास्तविक अर्थ है। अभी थोड़ी देर पहले ही युवा महोत्सव में सभी राज्यों और केंद्र शासित प्रदेशों के सांस्कृतिक दलों का मार्च पास्ट निकाला गया है।

एक भारत-श्रेष्ठ भारत एक प्रयास है देश की सांस्कृतिक विविधता को एक सूत्र में पिरोने का। हमारे देश में भाषाएं भले अलग-अलग हों, खान-पान अलग-अलग हों, रहने का तरीका अलग-अलग हो, रीति-रिवाज अलग-अलग हों, लेकिन आत्मा एक ही है। उस आत्मा का नाम है - भारतीयता। और इस भारतीयता के लिये मैं और आप हम सब गर्व करते हैं।

एक राज्य के नौजवान दूसरे राज्य के युवाओं से मिलेंगे तो उन्हें भी नया अनुभव होगा, एक दूसरे के प्रति सम्मान बढ़ेगा, समझ बढ़ेगी। लोग जब साथ रहते हैं, मिलते-जुलते हैं तो समझ आता है कि ये खान-पान और भाषाई अंतर सतही हैं। गहराई से देखें तो स्पष्ट होता है कि हमारे मूल्य, हमारी मानवीयता, हमारा दर्शन एक जैसा ही है।

दोस्तों, एक भारत-श्रेष्ठ भारत के तहत दो अलग-अलग राज्यों में एक साल के लिए partnership कराई गई है। इस वर्ष हरियाणा ने तेलंगाना के साथ अपनी partnershipकी है। दोनों राज्यों में किन विषयों पर परस्पर सहयोग होगा, इसके लिए Action Points भी बनाए गए हैं। मुझे उम्मीद है कि आज हरियाणा में तेलंगाना से आए छात्रों को विशेष रूप से बहुत कुछ जानने-सीखने को मिलेगा।

एक भारत-श्रेष्ठ भारत सिर्फ एक योजना नहीं है। इसे एक जनआंदोलन की तरह आगे बढ़ाया जा रहा है और ये तभी कामयाब होगी, जब देश के युवाओं का भरपूर साथ मिलेगा।

मेरे नौजवान साथियों, इस वर्ष देश पंडित दीन दयाल उपाध्याय की शताब्दी मना रहा है। देश के नौजवानों के लिए पंडित जी का मंत्र था- चरैवति-चरैवति, चरैवति यानी चलते रहो, चलते रहो, रुकना नहीं है, थमना नहीं, राष्ट्र निर्माण के पथ पर चलते जाना है।

टेकॉनोलॉजी के इस दौर में आज देश के नौजवानों को थ्री C’s पर ध्यान केंद्रित करना होगा। मैं जब थ्री C’s की बात करता हूं तो मेरा मतलब है पहला सी COLLECTIVITY, दूसरा सी CONNECTIVITY और तीसरा सी CREATIVITY...। COLLECTIVITY सामूहिकता जब तक कि हम संगठित शक्ति नहीं बनते हैं, हम भेद भाव को मिटाकर के भारतीय एकत्र नहीं होते हैं, COLLECTIVITY ताकत बहुत बड़ी ताकत होती है। दूसरी बात है CONNECTIVITY देश युग बदल चुका है। टेक्नोलॉजी ने पूरे विश्व को बहुत छोटा बना दिया है। पूरा विश्व आपकी हथेली में आपके हाथ में होता है। CONNECTIVITY समय की मांग है। हम CONNECTIVITY दृष्टि से Technology के साथ-साथ हमारे मानवीय मूल्यों को भी बल देते चलेंगे। और तीसरा सी मैंने कहा CREATIVITY नये विचार, नए INNOVATION,  पुरानी समस्याओं के नए समाधान करने के लिये नये तरीके और यही तो युवाओं से अपेक्षा रहती है। जिसपर CREATIVITY खत्म हो जाती है। INNOVATION खत्म हो जाता है। नयापन अटक जाता है एक प्रकार से जिंदगी ठहर जाती है। और इसलिये हमारे भीतर CREATIVITY को जितना अवसर दें हमें देते रहना चाहिए।

इसलिए एक दूसरे से संपर्क करिए, सामूहिक जिम्मेदारी निभाना सीखिए और नए विचारों पर काम करिए। अपने नए विचारों को ये सोचकर समाप्त मत होने दीजिए कि ये तो बहुत छोटे हैं या फिर दूसरे लोग क्या कहेंगे। याद रखिए कि दुनिया में ज्यादातर बड़े और नए विचारों को पहले खारिज ही किया गया है। जो भी मौजूदा सिस्टम होता है, वो नए विचारों का विरोध करता है। लेकिन मुझे विश्वास है कि हमारे देश की युवाशक्ति के आगे ऐसा हर विरोध ठंडा पड़ जाएगा।

साथियों, आज से पचास से भी ज्यादा वर्ष पूर्व एकात्म मानववाद पर बोलते हुए पंडित दीन दयाल उपाध्याय ने जो कहा था, उसमें भी देश के युवाओं के लिए बड़ा संदेश है। दीन दयाल उपाध्याय जी ने राष्ट्र निर्माण और देश में मौजूद बुराइयों से लड़ने का आह्वान किया था। उन्होंने कहा था-

“हमें अनेक रूढ़ियां खत्म करनी होंगी। बहुत से सुधार करने होंगे। जो हमारे मानव का विकास और राष्ट्र की एकात्मता की वृद्धि में पोषक हों, वह हम करेंगे और जो बाधक हो, उसे हटाएंगे। ईश्वर ने जैसा शरीर दिया है, उसमें मीनमेख निकालकर अथवा आत्मग्लानि लेकर चलने की आवश्यकता नहीं है। पर शरीर में फोड़ा होने पर उसका ऑपरेशन तो आवश्यक है। सजीव और स्वस्थ अंगों को काटने की जरूरत नहीं है। आज यदि समाज में छुआछूत और भेदभाव घर कर गए हैं, जिसके कारण लोग मानव को मानव समझकर नहीं चलते और जो राष्ट्र की एकता के लिए घातक सिद्ध हो रहे हैं, हम उनको खत्म करेंगे”।

पंडित जी का ये आह्वान आज भी उतनी ही अहमियत रखता है। आज भी देश में छुआछूत है, भ्रष्टाचार है, कालाधन है, अशिक्षा है, कुपोषण है। इन सभी बुराइयों को खत्म करने के लिए देश के युवा को अपनी शक्ति झोंकनी होगी। अभी कुछ दिनों पहले सरकार ने कालेधन और भ्रष्टाचार के खिलाफ बड़ी कार्रवाई की है। इस कार्रवाई को जितना समर्थन मेरे नौजवान दोस्तों ने दिया है, वो इस बात का सबूत है कि समाज में व्याप्त बुराई को मिटाने की आप सभी में कितनी जबरदस्त इच्छाशक्ति है।

इसलिए जब मैं कहता हूं मेरा देश बदल रहा है, तो उसके पीछे आपके प्रयास होते हैं। देश के अलग-अलग हिस्सों में हजारों-लाखों नौजवान अपनी-अपनी तरह से सामाजिक कुरितियों और चुनौतियों से लड़ रहे हैं। यही नहीं, वो ऐसे-ऐसे नए विचार सामने ला रहे हैं कि मैं उन्हें नमन किए बिना नहीं रह पाता।

अभी कुछ दिनों पहले मन की बात में मैंने एक बिटिया का जिक्र किया था जिसने ये आइडिया दिया कि शादी में मेहमानों को रिटर्न गिफ्ट के तौर पर आम के पेड़ दिए जाएंगे। पर्यावरण को बचाने के लिए ये कितना अद्भुत तरीका है।

इसी तरह एक इलाके में लोग कूड़े के डिब्बों की कमी से बहुत परेशान थे। ऐसे में वहां के नौजवानों ने मिलकर कूड़े के डिब्बों को एडवर्टाइजिंग से जोड़ दिया। अब वहां की सड़कों पर आपको हर जगह कूड़े के डिब्बे नजर आएंगे जिन पर विज्ञापन भी होगा। अब वहां कूड़े के डिब्बों को dustbin नहीं adbin बोलते हैं।

ऐसे भी नौजवान हैं जिन्होंने पिछले ही महीने relay format में सिर्फ 10 दिन में लगभग 6 हजार किलोमीटर सायकिल चलाकर “Golden Quadrilateral challenge” को पूरा किया है। इनका सूत्रवाक्य बहुत अच्छा है- “Follow the Rules & India will Rule”।

हमारे देश में ऊर्जा से भरे हुए ऐसे नौजवान हर कोने में उपस्थित हैं। कोई पहाड़ों से निकलने वाले छोटे झरनों से बिजली बना रहा है, कोई कूड़े से घर निर्माण की चीजें बना रहा है, कोई टेक्नोलॉजी के माध्यम से दूर-दराज वाले इलाके में मेडिकल सुविधा उपलब्ध करा रहा है, कोई सूखाग्रस्त इलाके में किसानों के लिए पानी बचाने के संसाधन जुटा रहा है। ऐसे लाखों युवा राष्ट्र निर्माण के लिए दिन रात एक कर रहे हैं।

ऐसे हर ऊर्जावान युवा के लिए मैं स्वामी विवेकानंद जी का संदेश फिर दोहराना चाहूंगा। उठो, जागो और जब तक लक्ष्य की प्राप्ति नहीं होती, रुको मत।

उठो का मतलब है शरीर को चैतन्यमय करो, शरीर को ऊर्जावान बनाओ, शरीर को फिट रखो। कई बार ऐसा भी देखा गया है कि लोग उठ तो जाते हैं लेकिन जागृत नहीं होते। इस वजह से वो स्थिति का सही आकलन नहीं कर पाते। इसलिए उठने के साथ ही जागृत होना भी आवश्यक है। जब तक लक्ष्य प्राप्ति ना हो, रुको मत...में भी बड़ा संदेश है। पहले तो स्पष्ट ध्येय का होना ही बहुत आवश्यक है।

जब यही नहीं तय होगा कि जाना कहां है, तो फिर ये कैसे तय हो पाएगा कि किस दिशा की और जाने वाली गाड़ी में बैठना है। इसलिए जब लक्ष्य तय हो जाए, तो फिर उसकी प्राप्ति के लिए बिना रुके , बिना थके प्रयास करते रहो।

मेरे दोस्तों, मेरे सामने आप सब देश की बौद्धिक ताकत के तौर पर मौजूद है। आज आवश्कता है युवाओं की उर्जा का रचनात्मक प्रयोग करने की। आज आवश्कता है युवाओं को दिगभ्रमित होने से बचाने की। आज आवश्कता है युवाओं को नशे और अपराध से दूर रखने की। आप चिंतन एवं मंथन करके नई राह बनाएं, नई मंजिलें हसिल करें। आपके सामने संभावनाओं का खुला आकाश है।

आज आवश्यकता है कि युवा सेवा की बेजोड़ मिसाल बनें। उनके चरित्र में ईमानदारी व निष्पक्षता हो। हर चुनौती का सामना करने का ज़ज्बा हो। उन्हें अपनी गौरवशाली विरासत पर गर्व हो। उनका आचरण एवं चरित्र नैतिक मूल्यों पर आधारित हो। इस पर इसलिए जोर दे रहा हूं, क्योंकि लक्ष्य पाना जितना मुश्किल है, उतना ही आसान लक्ष्य से भटकना होता है।

सुखी-संपन्न जीवन की आकांक्षा रखना सही है लेकिन इसी के साथ समाज और देश के प्रति जिम्मेदारी को भी समझना आवश्यक है। मैं आपको 1,2,3,4,5,6 यानि 6 चुनौतियों के बारे में बताता हूं जिनसे निपटना बहुत ही जरूरी है।

1.समाज के प्रति अज्ञान

2.समाज के प्रति असंवेदना

3.समाज के प्रति घिसी-पिटी सोच

4.जाति-समुदाय के विचार से ऊपर उठने की अक्षमता

5.माताओ-बहनों-बेटियों से दुर्व्यवहार

6.पर्यावरण के प्रति लापरवाही, गैर जिम्मेदार दृष्टिकोण

इन 6 चुनौतियों को आज के नौजवानों को ध्यान में रखना होगा, उन्हें परास्त करने का प्रयास करना होगा। आप जहां भी रहें, जिस भी क्षेत्र में काम करें, वहां इन चुनौतियों के बारे में अवश्य सोचें, उन्हें दूर करने की कोशिश करें।

आप सभी युवा tech-savvy हैं । आप सभी युवाओं को ये सन्देश जन-जन तक पहुँचाना है कि समाज में सकारात्मक परिवर्तन कैसे आ सकता है।

आप सभी युवा उन लोगों के जीवन को छूने का प्रयास करें जो वंचित हैं-शोषित हैं। दूसरों के भविष्य को बेहतर बनाने के लिए आप सभी युवाओं को अपनी ऊर्जा और समय देना है। युवाओं की ताकत, युवाओं की ऊर्जा और युवाओं का जज़्बा, बदलाव लाने में और भी अधिक कारगर होता है। अब करोड़ों युवा आवाज़ों को इस देश की आवाज़ बनकर विकास के कामों को आगे बढ़ाने में मदद करना है ।

मेरे साथियों, आप सभी नए क्षितिज को छुएं। विकास का नया विज़न तैयार करें, नई उपल्बधियां हासिल करें। इसी शुभकामना के साथ आपको राष्ट्रीय युवा दिवस और महोत्सव की बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं और बहुत बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। और स्वामी विवेकानंद जी की पुण्यस्मर्ण करते हुए हमारी भीतर की ऊर्जा को लेते हुए समाज के राष्ट्र के परिवार के गांव के गरीब के किसान के भलाई के लिये अपनी जिंदगी का कुछ न कुछ समय उनके लिये खपाने का संकल्प करें। देखीये जीवन में जो करने का संतोष मिलेगा उस संतोष की जो ताकत होगी। वो संतोष स्वयं में ऊर्जा का रूप धारण कर लेगा। मेरी आपको बहुत – बहुत शुभकामना है। देश के कोने कोने से आये हुए नौजवान एक प्रकार से लघु भारत मेरे सामने है। ये लघु भारत नई प्रेरणा नये उत्साह लेकर के गीता का ये गीता की भूमि है। जो कर्म का संदेश देती है। निष्काम कर्म योग का संदेश देती है। उसी को लेकर के आप चलें इसलिये मेरी इस युवा महोत्सव को बहुत बहुत शुभकामनाएं।  

धन्यवाद !!!

                Many-many Congratulations to my young friends, all the dignitaries present on the dais on the occasion of 21st youth festival. Though in person I am not with you in Rohtak for lack of time but the view of occasion is making me evident that this occasion has now matured as a 21 year young man. The beaming faces of my young friends coming from across the nooks and corner of this country are look like as the festival of light is being celebrated along with your celebrations. 

Today is National Youth Day and birth Anniversary of Swami Vivekananda. I greet the youth of this nation on this very occasion. Swami Vivekananda is one of the finest example of achieving a number of things in a short span of life. He lived a very short life. Swami Vivekananda was a source of unlimited motivations. In his words- “For now our nation calls for youth with strong nerves as well as young ones having strong will power”. 

Swami Vivekananda wanted to groom such young generation that was caring as well as mutually trust worthy having no discrimination. Youth is one who without worrying for his past, works for his future goals. Likewise what you all do today becomes. 

Friend, today more than 80 crore country men are below the age of 35 years. Treading the path of Swami Vivekananda has the potential of launch of an era that can make India a World Leader. 

For all my friends who are at present in Rohtak, this Haryana land is very inspiring. This land of Haryana is of Vedas, Upnishads, Geeta. This land is of brave ones especially the working hero’s as well of famers and soldiers. This is the land of sacred Saraswati. The initiatives of continually marching ahead can be learned from this soil by understanding and safeguarding of own culture. 

I am happy to note that this time the theme of this Youth Festival is “YOUTH FOR DIGITAL INDIA”. Youth will be trained in day –to- day Digital Transactions in this festival. My fervent appeal to all the youth present here to train at least 10 persons in their neighbourhood after getting trained from here. In creating a CASHLESS Economy you all have a bigger role. This will be one of your important contribution in the country in getting rid of black money and corruption. 

Daughter has been chosen as Logo of this festival. We affectionately named her “MHAARI LAADO”. Through this festival the effort to enhance awareness about “Beti Bachaao Beti Padhaao” is appreciable. Central Government launched this campaign from Haryana itself. This campaign has seen wide ranging impacts here. Things have begun to change. SEX RATIO too have changed remarkably. For this I specially congratulate people of Haryana. This shows that when people decides than impossible can be attained. I am sure Haryana soon will attain a point of pride for this nation. 

Youth of Haryana is contributing in a big way in shaping the future of this state. The youth of Haryana have given this country the accolade and proud moments by winning medals in many international sports events for ever. 

For attaining new developmental heights more contribution from youth is a dire necessity. The aim of India is to enable our youth in skill and potential for making this century as an Indian Century. 

Friends, National Youth Festival are a platform of showcasing your talent. You have come from different cultural backgrounds will have a chance of mutual interaction and assimilation with the diverse culture of this nation. This the real meaning of Ek Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat. Just now we have seen a march past by the cultural troupes from all States and Union Territories. 

Ek Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat is an attempt to garland the cultural diversity of nation in one string. This is one spirit despite language divide, diverse food, varied life style and distinguished culture. It is- Indian ness and we all are proud of it. 

Interaction between young ones from one state with other will be a new experience. It will pave way for mutual understanding and respect for each other. Assimilation and living together dispels many misgivings and one comes to know that difference of food habits and linguistic divides are superficial things. Insight further make things transparent and makes clear that our values, our human nature and our thinking are alike. 

Friends, under Ek Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat two different states have been brought together for One Year partnership. This year Haryana have entered in a partnership with Telangana. Action Points have been drawn for the possible mutual cooperation on a number of subjects. I hope Youth from Telangana will have something very special to learn in Haryana. 

Ek Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat is not merely a scheme. It is being pushed forward as a mass movement and this will become a full success only when the youth will support it wholeheartedly. 

Young friends this year is being observed as the birth centenary year of Pundit Deen Dayal Upadhyay. He gave the basic mantra Chairaveti- Chairaveti (Move on-move on) to the youth. Means, don’t stop but move on continuously for nation building. 

In the age of technology the young ones need focussing on 3 “C”s. For me 3 “C”s means COLLECTIVITY, CONNECTIVITY and CREATIVITY…. . COLLECTIVITY, until we are united and assimilated by dispelling inequality. Collective force is unmatched. The second one is CONNECTIVITY. It’s a new age technology that has made the world very small. The entire world is in your hands. CONNECTIVITY is need of the hour. Through CONNECTIVITY and technology we will enrich human values also. The third one I have mentioned is CREATIVITY which enshrines new thoughts and new INNOVATIONs solving old problems by new approach. This is what we expect from younger generation. When CREATIVITYs decimates, innovation and advancements also halts. So CREATIVITYs should be given as much as opportunities. 

So communicate and get connected with each other. Learn being collectively responsible and work on new ideas. Don’t leave your thoughts by merely terming them too small or timid or thinking what others will say on these thoughts. Remember, new and big thoughts have always seen rejections at initial stages. The system that prevails always opposes new ideas. But I hope every such opposition is bound to subside before the youth of our country. 

Friends, more than fifty years ago what Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay said on Integral Humanism (Ekaatm Maanav vad), do have an important message for the young ones of the nation. Deen Dayal Upadhyay had given a clarion call for nation building in and countering the corruption. He said then: 

“We will have to eradicate many customs and will have to go for many reforms. We will do what is required for the fostering of our people and national integrity and will remove the obstacles. We need not cut a sorry figure for the type of physique given to us by the almighty but any kind of abs is in body requires timely surgery. Live and healthy organs should not be chopped off. But we will put an end to the persisting untouchability and discrimination within the society which is proving lethal to the nation if, people doesn’t consider other persons alike them”. 

The call by Pandit ji still holds ground. Still there prevails untouchability, corruption, black money, illiteracy and malnutrition in the country. The young ones will have to use their entire energy for the eradication of such maladies. Recently the government has pounced heavily against black money and corruption. The immense support given by my young friends for this action is a glaring evidence of your indomitable desire for the eradication of such evils from within the society. 

So when I say my country is changing, then these are your efforts behind it. Thousands and lakhs of youth are confronting social disparities and challenges in their own style. Not only this, they are coming froth with such new ideas that I cannot stop myself bowing before them. Just some days ago I had referred to one little daughter in “Man Ki Baat” who gave the idea of giving mango plant saplings as a return gift to guests coming in marriage ceremonies. What an amazing idea to conserve the environment? 

Similarly in one area people were confronting with the shortage of dustbins. So youth there clubbed advertising with dustbins. Now you will find there dustbin at almost every place carrying advertisements. Now there dustbin is called adbin. 

Now there are some young ones who paddled cycles in relay format to complete the nearly 6 thousand kilometre long “Golden Quadrilateral Challenge” in 10 days. They had a very attractive motto- “Follow the Rules & India will Rule”. 

Such energy enriched youths are present in every nook and corner of our country. Someone is producing electricity from the small rivulets flowing down the hills, someone is crafting house making goods from the garbage and waste material, someone is engaged in providing medical facility to remote areas using technology, and someone is busy in water conservation measures for farmers in drought prone areas. Such millions of youth are toiling hard 24 hours for nation building. 

For such energetic young ones I once again repeat the message of Swami Vivekannda- Stand up, get awaken and don’t stop till your goal is attained. 

Stand up means vitalise your body, make body energetic and keep the body fit. Sometimes people gets up but they are not awake. So they are unable to judge the things as well as the situation. So it is necessary to get awakened after standing up. Don’t stop till the goal is attained….also carries a message. The concept of goal should be clear first of all. 

Not only this, if the destination is not chosen then how one will take the destination bound vehicle? So when the goal is set, make continuous relentless efforts until it is achieved. 

Friends, you are present here as country’s intellectual power. Today creative application of youth power is needed. Today it is required that youth mind set should be protected from being misguided. Keeping youth away from crime and addiction is needed. Attain your targets on a new path after due consideration and thought. Infinite horizon of possibilities is in front of you. 

Today it is needed that youth should become an exemplary icon of service. Honesty and justice should reflect from their role and character. They should be ready to face any challenge. They should be proud of their glorious heritage. Their conduct and character should be based on moral values. My high emphasis on this aspect is just because it is easy to get deviated from the target rather than the attainment. 

Ambition of having happy-luxurious life is alright but along with this duties and responsibilities towards society and nation also should be kept in mind. I am telling you of six challenges that are to be handled. 

1. Ignorance towards society

2. Insensitiveness towards society

3. Outdated approach towards society

4. Inability to rise above the thought of caste and creed

5. Misbehaviour with mothers- sisters-daughters

6. Callousness towards environment, irresponsible approach

The youth of today must keep these six challenges in his mind and will have to strive to overcome them. Wherever you live and work, should also have a consideration for these challenges and their solution. 

You all are tech-savvy young ones. You have to convey this messages to masses that how a positive change can be brought about in the society. 

All of you have to strive for touching the life of those who are deprived, marginalised and exploited. You have to give your time and energy for the betterment of others future. The strength of youth, their energy and approach is highly effective in bringing changes. Now the crores of youth voices have to become the voice of nation and usher in the developmental process further ahead. 

My friends you all should touch the new vistas and heights. Chalk out a new vision of development and attain new successes. With this greeting I congratulate you for the National Youth Day and Festival. Have a remembrance of Swami Vivekanand ji, take our innate energy use it for the welfare of society and country especially the poor villagers and farmers and take a resolve to give some of your life time for them. This will give you a life satisfaction and the power attained from this noble deed will itself become a source of energy. My best wishes are with you. Ahead of me is the youth here coming from across the country is another form of mini India. This mini India is full of new inspirations and vigour and is in the land of Geeta which spells the voice of Karma, Nishkam Karma (Work without any desire). You carry it with your resolves so my best wishes for this youth festival.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the inaugural event of the National Youth Festival at Rohtak, via video conferencing.

He said that the life of Swami Vivekananda shows what one can achieve at a young age, and added that the work that the youth are doing today will impact the future of the nation.

He expressed happiness that the theme for this festival is 'youth for Digital India.’ He urged the youth to guide people on increased cashless transactions. Corruption and black money adversely affect the progress of our nation, he added.

The Prime Minister said that times have changed due to the influence of technology, and the need of the hour is collectivity, connectivity, and creativity. He said that the support from the youth in the fight against corruption convinces him that it is possible to bring a positive change in the nation.

                Your Excellency, President Uhuru Kenyatta, 
Distinguished delegates, 
Members of the Media, 
Friends, 

Exactly six months ago, I had the pleasure of visiting Kenya. President Kenyatta and the people of Kenya received me with great warmth and genuine affection. And, today I am delighted to welcome President Kenyatta and his delegation in India. The close association between our two countries is, of course, much older. India and Kenya fought together against colonialism. Just last month, President Kenyatta recognized the contribution of Makhan Singh, an Indian born trade union leader, joining hands with his Kenyan brothers to help overthrow the colonial order in Kenya. Common belief in democratic values, our shared developmental priorities and the warm currents of the Indian Ocean bind our societies. 

Friends, 

In our discussions today, President and I reviewed the full range of our relationship. During my visit to Kenya last year, we had identified deepening of economic cooperation as one of the key focus areas of our efforts. In this context, expansion of bilateral trade, greater flow of capital between two economies, and stronger developmental partnership are a priority. Yesterday, President Kenyatta led a strong and high level delegation to the eighth Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit. Your participation in Vibrant Gujarat has generated a strong interest in Indian businesses to connect with commercial and investment opportunities in Kenya. We want, and will encourage, industry and business in both countries to take lead in exploiting opportunities in healthcare, tourism, information technology, agriculture, blue economy and energy. The Joint Business Council meeting tomorrow will work to build commercial engagement through specific projects in these areas. To boost trade, we are also cooperating on trade facilitation measures, including standardization and related areas. Broad based and wide ranging cooperation in agriculture and food security is our shared priority. We are collaborating to raise agricultural productivity in Kenya. The Line of Credit Agreement of $100 million signed for agricultural mechanisation today would open a new dimension of engagement. Long term arrangement with Kenya for production and import of pulses is being explored and discussed. We would also be happy to share best practises in organic farming with Kenyan farmers. In the health sector, Bhabhatron machine has been delivered to the Kenyatta National Hospital for cancer treatment. Related capacity building of the Kenyan doctors is being undertaken under our India Africa Forum Summit initiative. Partnership in Education is creating new connections between our people. We have a strong relationship with the University of Nairobi, where a Chair for Indian Studies has been established by ICCR, and renovation of its library is also being undertaken with Indian assistance. On energy, we value Kenya's support to the International Solar Alliance, and our joint efforts to harness the energy of the sun to power our economic growth. 

Friends, 

The challenges in the Maritime domain are a shared concern. But we would also explore opportunities in blue economy. We are focused on quick operationalization of our defence cooperation. Some of the specific areas of priority would be hydrography, communications networks, anti-piracy, capacity building, exchanges and defence medical cooperation. We are also partnering to strengthen our security cooperation and capacities. In this context, we have directed the Joint Working Group to meet early. It would focus on cyber security, counter terrorism, combating drugs, narcotics, human trafficking and money laundering. 

Friends, 

The large Indian-origin community of Kenya is a vital and energetic link between us. I have discussed with President Kenyatta ways to engage them with our trade, investments and cultural exchanges. In our meeting last year, President and I had also agreed to accord close and personal supervision of the implementation of our decisions. We need to ensure its continuing rigour . 

Excellency, 

Once again, on behalf of the people of India and on my own behalf, I thank you for accepting our invitation and honouring us with your presence, both in Gujarat and in Delhi. 

Thank You. 
Thank you very much.

                I welcome you all to the Vibrant Gujarat Summit. I also wish you a very happy, prosperous and successful new year. I fondly recall the modest launch of this event in 2003. Since then it has been a very successful journey.
 
I express my gratitude to the partner countries and organisations – a list which includes Japan, Canada, USA, UK, Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, France, Poland, Sweden, Singapore and UAE. I particularly thank the initial partner countries of the Vibrant Gujarat event: Japan and Canada.
 
Many other prestigious global organisations and networks are also partners of this event. I thank you all for this partnership. Your presence is a source of motivation for business leaders as well as young entrepreneurs gathered here. Without your support, this event could not have seen eight biennial chapters; each better and bigger than the earlier one.
 
The last three events have been particularly big. The presence of political and business leaders from more than 100 countries, and a large number of organisations from around the world make this a truly global event.
 
I would urge the participants to reach out to each other and to derive the greatest benefit from this summit. You should also visit the trade show and the exhibition where hundreds of companies have showcased their products and processes.
 
Gujarat, the land of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, also represents the business spirit of India. Through the ages, it has led in commerce and enterprise. Centuries ago, its people went across the seven seas in search of opportunities. Even today, this state boasts of being the origin of the highest number of our people living and working abroad. And wherever they have gone, they have created a mini-Gujarat. We proudly say: ज्यां ज्यां बसे एक गुजराती, त्यां त्यां सदाकाल गुजरात. In other words, Wherever a Gujarati resides; there, forever, resides Gujarat. 
 
Gujarat is currently in the midst of the Kite Festival. May the kites inspire us all to fly high!
 
Friends!
 
As I have often said India’s strength lies in the three Ds: Democracy, Demography and Demand.
 
Our biggest strength is the depth of our Democracy. Some people say that democracy cannot deliver effective and fast track governance. But we have seen in the last two and a half years that it is possible to deliver quick results in a democratic set up as well.
 
Over the last two and a half years, we have also evolved a culture of healthy competition among states. States are being rated on parameters of Good Governance. The World Bank is helping us in this process.
 
Coming to Demography, ours is a nation of vibrant youth.  The disciplined, dedicated, and talented youth of India offers a globally unmatched work-force. We are the second largest English speaking country. Our youth are not merely looking for jobs. They have begun taking risks and often prefer to become Entrepreneurs.
 
On the Demand front, our rising middle class offers a huge domestic market.
 
The seas that surround the Indian peninsula, connect us to some of the world’s biggest markets, including Africa, the Middle East and Europe.
 
Nature has been kind to us. Our three crop seasons enable us to grow food, vegetables and fruits in abundance.
 
The diversity in our flora and fauna is unparalleled. The richness of our culture and its living symbols is unique. Our Institutions and scholars are recognised the world over. India is now an emerging R&D hub. We produce the world’s second largest number of scientists and engineers. 

Our entertainment industry is making waves worldwide. All this helps ensure a good quality of life, at relatively low cost.
 
 
Friends! 
Our Government was elected first and foremost on the promise to provide clean Governance and end the prevailing regime of corruption and nepotism. It is our vision and mission to bring a paradigm shift in the ways of our polity and economy. We have taken a series of decisions and steps in this direction. To give you some examples, we are bringing a shift: 
 
 
·         From relation based Governance to system based Governance;
·         From discretionary administration to policy based administration;
·         From random interference to technological intervention;
·         From favouritism to level playing field; 
·         From Informal economy to formal economy. 
 
In doing this, digital technology has played a key role. I have often said that e-governance is easy and effective Governance. I have also emphasized the need for policy driven Governance. Online processes help bring speed and openness in decision making. Towards this end, we are working to adopt and absorb newer technologies, to bring about transparency, and to end discretion. Believe me, we are on the threshold of becoming the world’s most digitised economy. Most of you wanted this change in India. I am proud to say that it is happening before you.
 
Over the last two and a half years, we have worked relentlessly to realise India’s potential, and to set right the economy. The results have been encouraging. There has been substantial improvement in key macro-economic indicators like GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, current account deficit as well as foreign investments.
 
India has become the fastest growing major economy in the world. Despite the global slowdown, we have registered excellent growth.Today, India is a bright spot in the global economy. We are seen as the engine of global growth.
 
World Bank, IMF and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days. In 2014-15, India contributed 12.5 per cent of global growth. Its contribution to global growth is sixty eight per cent higher, than its share of the world economy.
 
Creating an enabling environment for business, and attracting investments, is my top priority. We have to do this in order to create opportunities for our youth. With that spirit, we are moving towards implementation of some historic initiatives. This includes the Goods and Services Tax.
 
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the National Company Law Tribunal, a new arbitration framework and a new IPR regime are all in place. New commercial courts have also been set up.  These are just a few examples of the direction in which we are going. My government is strongly committed to continue the reform of the Indian economy.
 
Friends!
 
We have placed the highest emphasis on Ease of Doing Business. We have taken decisive steps to ease licensing processes, and rationalize provisions and procedures relating to clearances, returns, and inspections. We are monitoring implementation of hundreds of action points across various sectors, aimed at improving the regulatory framework. This is part of our promise of Good Governance.
The outcomes of our efforts are visible in India’s global rankings on various indicators. A number of global reports and assessments over the last two years have shown that India has improved its policies, practices and hence its economic profile.
India’s rank has improved considerably, in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report.
India is ranked third in the list of top prospective host economies for 2016-18 in the World Investment Report 2016 released by UNCTAD.
Our rank also improved by thirty two positions in World Economic Forum’s ‘Global Competitiveness Report 2015-16 and 2016-17’;
We have moved up sixteen ranks in the ‘Global Innovation Index 2016’ brought out by WIPO and other institutions;
We have moved up nineteen positions in the World Bank’s ‘Logistics Performance Index of 2016.’
You can see that we are moving closer to global best practices. Day by day we are getting more and more integrated with the world. Our confidence has been boosted by the positive impact of our policies and practices. This also gives us the motivation to further simplify our processes to become the easiest place to do business.
Every day, we are further rationalising our policies and procedures, to make it simple for businesses to establish and grow.
We have liberalised our FDI regime in many sectors and in various ways. India is today among the most open economies.
This change in environment has been recognized by both domestic and foreign investors. An encouraging Start-up eco-system is now taking shape in the country. This unleashing of the youth power is heartening. 
The total FDI inflows in the last two and a half years have touched US Dollars one hundred and thirty billion. The FDI equity inflow in the last two financial years was sixty per cent higher as compared to previous two financial years. In fact, the total FDI inflows received during the last year have been the highest ever.
The number of countries from where FDI is coming in, and the sectors in which they are being routed have also diversified in the last two years. India is now the leading recipient of capital investment in the Asia-Pacific. It also continues to be among the top ten countries globally in terms of FDI inflows.
But the story does not end here. India has left every other country behind in terms of providing return on investment. In 2015, India has risen to first position in the Baseline Profitability Index.
 
Friends!
Make in India has become the biggest brand that India has ever had. It is directed towards making India a global hub for manufacturing, design and innovation. 
मैं साथियो ये अनुभव करता हूं, मैं दुनिया में जहां-जहां गया; मैं अगर पांच बार “Make in India” बोलता था वहां तो Host country लीडर 50 बार “Make in India” बोलते थे। एक प्रकार से “Make in India” ये दुनिया की नजरों में भारत को एक Investment का destination बना चुका है। भारत में राज्‍यों के initiative, केंद्र सरकार का सहयोग, ये संयुक्‍त प्रयास “Make in India” के लिए बहुत सारे द्वार खोल चुका है। 
 
इस Opportunity का लाभ हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के राज्‍यों के बीच में Competition पैदा हो, Healthy Competition हो और वो भी Good Governance and Eco-System के आधार पर हो। Competition पहले भी हुआ करती थी, 15 साल पहले एक राज्‍य दूसरे से ज्‍यादा चीजें दे देता था, दूसरे तीसरे से ज्‍यादा देता था; देने की स्‍पर्धा होती थी, आखिर अगर कोई नहीं आता था लेकिन जहां-जहां Good Governance को बल दिया गया, जहां-जहां Proper Eco-System पैदा किया गया, जहां-जहां Regulations को ठीक किया गया, जहां-जहां Business Environment को Friendly बनाया गया, वहां पर अधिक मात्रा में दुनिया के बाहर के लोग भी आने लगे और इसलिए “Make in India” या दुनिया में कहीं पर भी समझाना पड़े ऐसी स्थिति नहीं है। और मैं गुजरात सरकार को अभिनंदन करता हूं, उन्‍होंने अपनी Progressive नीतियों के आधार पर Good Governance को बल देते हुए Foreign Direct Investment को Attract करने में बहुत ही अग्रिमता सिद्ध की है। गुजरात सरकार की पूरी टीम को इसके लिए मैं बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। 
 
‘Make in India’ has celebrated its second anniversary recently.
I am delighted to share that we have become the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth largest previously. Our Gross Value Added in manufacturing has recorded a growth of nine per cent in 2015-16. This is much higher than the five to six per cent growth in the previous three years.
All this is helping us expand the job market and raise the purchasing power of our people. But the real potential is even higher.
To give you a few examples: India’s Food Processing Industry is expected to increase almost five fold in the next ten years. Similarly, India's low vehicle penetration makes it one of the world's most attractive auto markets.
At the Government level, we have to ensure that our growth process is inclusive and embraces both rural and urban communities. 
एक भारत ऐसा देश है हम गांव और शहर के बीच संतुलित विकास के पक्ष में हैं। हमारी नीतियों का लाभ गावं और शहर, दोनों को समान रूप से मिलना चाहिए और इसलिए हमारी योजना की priority में भी गांव को भी उतना ही महात्‍मय मिले, हर विकास की यात्रा का अन्तिम Benefit गांव गरीब किसान तक पहुंचे, ये हमारा priority का रहने के कारण सारी नीतियों के केंद्र में उन बातों को हमने बल दिया है। 
 
We are committed to an India with: 
·         Better job opportunities;
·         Better income;
·         Better purchasing power;
·         Better quality of life;
·         And better living standards.
 
Friends!
 
Our Development needs are huge. Our development agenda is ambitious. For instance:
·         We want to provide a roof over every head;
हर गरीब को घर होना चाहिए और अपना घर होना चाहिए और 2022 तक होना चाहिए, ये सपना ले करके हम चल रहे हैं।
·         We want to provide jobs to every hand;
800 millions 35 से कम age group के Indians जो एक प्रकार से युवा भारत है। 800 million youth जिनकी उम्र 35 thirty five से कम है, इन हाथ में हुनर हो, काम का अवसर हो, तो नया हिन्‍दुस्‍तान हमारी आंखों के सामने बना करके खड़ा कर देंगे, ये विश्‍वास हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के नौजवानों के प्रति मेरा है, हम सबका है और हम सबका जिम्‍मा भी है कि उस अवसर को हम दें। और हम अवसर दे सकते हैं, संभावनाएं भरपूर पड़ी हैं। 
 
·         We want to produce energy that is cleaner;
·         We want to build roads and railways faster;
·         We want mineral exploration to become greener;
·         We want to build urban amenities that are sturdier
·         We want to see our quality of life getting better and better 
 
We are taking a leap towards next generation infrastructure: in both core and social sectors; in both rural and urban areas. This includes Freight Corridors, Industrial Corridors, High Speed and Metro Rail projects, Logistics Parks, Smart Cities, Coastal Zones, regional airports, water, sanitation and energy initiatives. Our per capita electricity consumption must rise. Even as we do so, we are committed to promoting renewable energy.
We are keen to promote tourism in a big way and this needs tourism infrastructure. 
जब मैं renewable energy की बात करता हूं Hundred Seventy Five Giga Watt, एक जमाना था हम Megawatt  की चर्चा करते भी डरते थे, आज देश Giga Watt के सपने देख रहा है। ये बहुत बड़ा, बहुत बड़ा बदलाव है। Hundred Seventy Five Giga Watt renewable energy, Energy-mix जिसमें Solar हो, Wind हो, Nuclear हो और दुनिया जो Global Warming से परेशान है, उस विश्‍व को बचाने का सपना हमने भी देखा है। और हम भी Hundred Seventy Five Giga Watt के Contribution से विश्‍व को Global Warming से बचाने के उस संकल्‍प को पूरा करने में हिन्‍दुस्‍तान अपनी नंबर एक की भूमिका अदा करने के लिए कृतसंकल्‍प हो करके आगे बढ़ रहा है, तो मैं पूरे विश्‍व को निमंत्रण देता हूं आइए, Hundred Seventy Five Giga Watt renewable energy के क्षेत्र में Investment के लिए Sky is the limit और हमारी Policies are very progressive. और मुझे विश्‍वास है कि मानवता का भी ये काम है जीवन की तरफ देखने का एक दृष्टिकोण बदलने का ये अवसर है। हमने दो शताब्‍दी Exploitation of Nature के अंदर खपा दी हैं। अब हमारा दायित्‍व है कि आने वाली शताब्दियों को Exploitation of Nature के हमारे सोच में से बाहर ला करके हमारी Nature को Strengthen करने की Basic चीजों को ले करके चलना इसका अवसर है। और उस बात को ले करके हम चलेंगे तो हम अवश्‍य ही विश्‍व में एक बड़े परिवर्तन की संभावनाओं में बहुत बड़ी अहम भूमिका अदा कर सकते हैं। 
 
The targets for construction of roads and laying of railways have been increased manifold. India is going to emerge as one of the world’s largest construction markets as it adds millions of homes. All this offers unprecedented opportunities for the investor community. Most of you can work with us in a number of areas which include:
·         From hardware to software;
·         From soft skills to scientific temper
·         From defence systems to cyber security
·         From medicine to tourism;
I daresay, that India alone offers the opportunities that could rival those of an entire continent. It offers today, the possibilities of a full century. And we want to do all this in a cleaner, greener and sustainable way. We are committed to protect the environment and uphold our responsibility towards Nature. Ultimately, this is what India has stood for since ages. 
 
Welcome to India:
·         The land of tradition and tranquillity;
·         The land of empathy and excitement;
·         The land of experiment and enterprise. 
·         The land of openings and opportunities;
 
Once again, I welcome you and invite you to be part of -
·         India of Today;
·         and India of Tomorrow. 
I assure you that I will be available to hold your hands whenever required.
 
Thank You!

                I welcome you all to the Vibrant Gujarat Summit. I also wish you a very happy, prosperous and successful new year. I fondly recall the modest launch of this event in 2003. Since then it has been a very successful journey.

I express my gratitude to the partner countries and organizations – a list which includes Japan, Canada, USA, UK, Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, France, Poland, Sweden, Singapore and UAE. I particularly thank the initial partner countries of the Vibrant Gujarat event: Japan and Canada.

Many other prestigious global organizations and networks are also partners of this event. I thank you all for this partnership. Your presence is a source of motivation for business leaders as well as young entrepreneurs gathered here. Without your support, this event could not have seen eight biennial chapters; each better and bigger than the earlier one.

The last three events have been particularly big. The presence of political and business leaders from more than 100 countries, and a large number of organizations from around the world make this a truly global event.

I would urge the participants to reach out to each other and to derive the greatest benefit from this summit. You should also visit the trade show and the exhibition where hundreds of companies have showcased their products and processes.

Gujarat, the land of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, also represents the business spirit of India. Through the ages, it has led in commerce and enterprise. Centuries ago, its people went across the seven seas in search of opportunities. Even today, this state boasts of being the origin of the highest number of our people living and working abroad. And wherever they have gone, they have created a mini-Gujarat. We proudly say: ज्यां ज्यां बसे एक गुजराती, त्यां त्यां सदाकाल गुजरात (Wherever resides a Gujarati, there is always Gujarat’s time). In other words, Wherever a Gujarati resides; there, forever, resides Gujarat.

Gujarat is currently in the midst of the Kite Festival. May the kites inspire us all to fly high!

Friends!

As I have often said India’s strength lies in the three Ds: Democracy, Demography and Demand.

Our biggest strength is the depth of our Democracy. Some people say that democracy cannot deliver effective and fast track governance. But we have seen in the last two and a half years that it is possible to deliver quick results in a democratic set up as well.

Over the last two and a half years, we have also evolved a culture of healthy competition among states. States are being rated on parameters of Good Governance. The World Bank is helping us in this process.

Coming to Demography, ours is a nation of vibrant youth. The disciplined, dedicated, and talented youth of India offers a globally unmatched work-force. We are the second largest English speaking country. Our youth are not merely looking for jobs. They have begun taking risks and often prefer to become Entrepreneurs.

On the Demand front, our rising middle class offers a huge domestic market.

The seas that surround the Indian peninsula, connect us to some of the world’s biggest markets, including Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

Nature has been kind to us. Our three crop seasons enable us to grow food, vegetables and fruits in abundance.

The diversity in our flora and fauna is unparalleled. The richness of our culture and its living symbols is unique. Our Institutions and scholars are recognized the world over. India is now an emerging R&D hub. We produce the world’s second largest number of scientists and engineers.

Our entertainment industry is making waves worldwide. All this helps ensure a good quality of life, at relatively low cost.

Friends!

Our Government was elected first and foremost on the promise to provide clean Governance and end the prevailing regime of corruption and nepotism. It is our vision and mission to bring a paradigm shift in the ways of our polity and economy. We have taken a series of decisions and steps in this direction. To give you some examples, we are bringing a shift:


	From relation based Governance to system based Governance;
	From discretionary administration to policy based administration;
	From random interference to technological intervention;
	From favoritism to level playing field;
	From Informal economy to formal economy.


In doing this, digital technology has played a key role. I have often said that e-governance is easy and effective Governance. I have also emphasized the need for policy driven Governance. Online processes help bring speed and openness in decision making. Towards this end, we are working to adopt and absorb newer technologies, to bring about transparency, and to end discretion. Believe me, we are on the threshold of becoming the world’s most digitized economy. Most of you wanted this change in India. I am proud to say that it is happening before you.

Over the last two and a half years, we have worked relentlessly to realize India’s potential, and to set right the economy. The results have been encouraging. There has been substantial improvement in key macro-economic indicators like GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, current account deficit as well as foreign investments.

India has become the fastest growing major economy in the world. Despite the global slowdown, we have registered excellent growth. Today, India is a bright spot in the global economy. We are seen as the engine of global growth.

World Bank, IMF and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days. In 2014-15, India contributed 12.5 per cent of global growth. Its contribution to global growth is sixty eight per cent higher, than its share of the world economy.

Creating an enabling environment for business, and attracting investments, is my top priority. We have to do this in order to create opportunities for our youth. With that spirit, we are moving towards implementation of some historic initiatives. This includes the Goods and Services Tax.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the National Company Law Tribunal, a new arbitration framework and a new IPR regime are all in place. New commercial courts have also been set up.  These are just a few examples of the direction in which we are going. My government is strongly committed to continue the reform of the Indian economy.

Friends!

We have placed the highest emphasis on Ease of Doing Business. We have taken decisive steps to ease licensing processes, and rationalize provisions and procedures relating to clearances, returns, and inspections. We are monitoring implementation of hundreds of action points across various sectors, aimed at improving the regulatory framework. This is part of our promise of Good Governance.

The outcomes of our efforts are visible in India’s global rankings on various indicators. A number of global reports and assessments over the last two years have shown that India has improved its policies, practices and hence it’s economic profile.

India’s rank has improved considerably, in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report.

India is ranked third in the list of top prospective host economies for 2016-18 in the World Investment Report 2016 released by UNCTAD.

Our rank also improved by thirty two positions in World Economic Forum’s ‘Global Competitiveness Report 2015-16 and 2016-17’;

We have moved up sixteen ranks in the ‘Global Innovation Index 2016’ brought out by WIPO and other institutions;

We have moved up nineteen positions in the World Bank’s ‘Logistics Performance Index of 2016.’

You can see that we are moving closer to global best practices. Day by day we are getting more and more integrated with the world. Our confidence has been boosted by the positive impact of our policies and practices. This also gives us the motivation to further simplify our processes to become the easiest place to do business.

Every day, we are further rationalizing our policies and procedures, to make it simple for businesses to establish and grow.

We have liberalized our FDI regime in many sectors and in various ways. India is today among the most open economies.

This change in environment has been recognized by both domestic and foreign investors. An encouraging Start-up eco-system is now taking shape in the country. This unleashing of the youth power is heartening.

The total FDI inflows in the last two and a half years have touched US Dollars one hundred and thirty billion. The FDI equity inflow in the last two financial years was sixty per cent higher as compared to previous two financial years. In fact, the total FDI inflows received during the last year have been the highest ever.

The number of countries from where FDI is coming in, and the sectors in which they are being routed have also diversified in the last two years. India is now the leading recipient of capital investment in the Asia-Pacific. It also continues to be among the top ten countries globally in terms of FDI inflows.

But the story does not end here. India has left every other country behind in terms of providing return on investment. In 2015, India has risen to first position in the Baseline Profitability Index.

Friends!

Make in India has become the biggest brand that India has ever had. It is directed towards making India a global hub for manufacturing, design and innovation.

Friends, I experience this thing that wherever I visited in the world if I said Make in India five times then the leader of the host country said it fifty times.  In a way this ‘Make in India’ has made India an investment destination in the eyes of the world. The initiatives taken by Indian states and cooperation of the central government, this joint effort has opened plenty of doors for Make in India.

The benefits of this opportunity and creation of a competition between the states, a healthy completion based on good governance and eco system should be there. There used to be competition earlier as well, 15 years ago one state used to provide more than the other, the other one used to provide more than the third one, there was a competition to provide things and there was none who used to be the last, however, wherever there was an emphasis on good governance, wherever a proper eco-system was created, regulations were corrected, the environment was made business friendly, there the people from abroad came in large numbers and that is why there is no requirement to explain what is ‘Make in India’ anywhere in the world. And I salute Gujarat government, it has proved its forwardness in attracting the foreign direct investment due to the progressive policies and its emphasis on the good governance.

 ‘Make in India’ has celebrated its second anniversary recently.

I am delighted to share that we have become the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth largest previously. Our Gross Value Added in manufacturing has recorded a growth of nine per cent in 2015-16. This is much higher than the five to six per cent growth in the previous three years.

All this is helping us expand the job market and raise the purchasing power of our people. But the real potential is even higher.

To give you a few examples: India’s Food Processing Industry is expected to increase almost five fold in the next ten years. Similarly, India's low vehicle penetration makes it one of the world's most attractive auto markets.

At the Government level, we have to ensure that our growth process is inclusive and embraces both rural and urban communities.

India is country where we are in the favor of balanced growth in villages and cities. Our policies should equally benefit both villages and cities and that is why we have emphasized on this thing, made it the focal point of all our policies to provide equal importance to the villages, to provide the final benefit to the poor farmer.

We are committed to an India with:


	Better job opportunities;
	Better income;
	Better purchasing power;
	Better quality of life;
	And better living standards.


 Friends!

Our Development needs are huge. Our development agenda is ambitious. For instance:


	We want to provide a roof over every head;


We have been moving forward with this dream that every poor should have his own house and he should have it by 2022.


	We want to provide jobs to every hand;


800 million Indian below the age of 35, in a way it’s an young India. 800 million youth who are below the age of 35, if they have skills and get the opportunity to work then would create a New India. I have this faith in Indian youth, we all have this confidence in them and it is our responsibility to provide this opportunity to them and we can give that opportunity and the possibilities are immense.


	We want to produce energy that is cleaner;
	We want to build roads and railways faster;
	We want mineral exploration to become greener;
	We want to build urban amenities that are sturdier
	We want to see our quality of life getting better and better


 We are taking a leap towards next generation infrastructure: in both core and social sectors; in both rural and urban areas. This includes Freight Corridors, Industrial Corridors, High Speed and Metro Rail projects, Logistics Parks, Smart Cities, and Coastal Zones, regional airports, water, sanitation and energy initiatives. Our per capita electricity consumption must rise. Even as we do so, we are committed to promoting renewable energy.

We are keen to promote tourism in a big way and this needs tourism infrastructure.

When I talk about hundred seventy five Giga Watt renewable energy, there was a time when were afraid of discussing even in terms of Megawatt and today the country is dreaming of Giga Watt. It’s a big change. Hundred and Seventy Five Giga Watt of renewable energy, an energy-mix which has Solar, Wind and Nuclear, and the world that is concerned over global warming, we also have a dream of saving the world. And, we too by the contribution of hundred and seventy five Giga Watt, when India is resolutely moving forward to fulfill its obligation by playing the lead role in saving the world from global warming, at this time I invite the world to come forward and investment in the renewable energy sector of hundred and seventy five Giga Watts as sky is the limit and our policies are very progressive.

And I am confident that this is also a work of humanity, this is an opportunity to change our way of looking at life. We have spent two centuries in exploiting the nature. Now it is our responsibility to bring the future centuries out of our thinking of exploiting the nature and it is an opportunity to do the basic thing of strengthening the nature. And if we move forward with this thinking then we can play an important role in the possibilities of bringing about big changes in the world.

The targets for construction of roads and laying of railways have been increased manifold. India is going to emerge as one of the world’s largest construction markets as it adds millions of homes. All this offers unprecedented opportunities for the investor community. Most of you can work with us in a number of areas which include:


	From hardware to software;
	From soft skills to scientific temper
	From defense systems to cyber security
	From medicine to tourism;


I daresay, that India alone offers the opportunities that could rival those of an entire continent. It offers today, the possibilities of a full century. And we want to do all this in a cleaner, greener and sustainable way. We are committed to protect the environment and uphold our responsibility towards Nature. Ultimately, this is what India has stood for since ages.

Welcome to India:


	The land of tradition and tranquility;
	The land of empathy and excitement;
	The land of experiment and enterprise.
	The land of openings and opportunities;


Once again, I welcome you and invite you to be part of –


	India of Today;
	and India of Tomorrow.


I assure you that I will be available to hold your hands whenever required.

 Thank You!

                Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Vijay Rupani ji,
My Colleague Union Minister Dr. Harshvardhan ji,
Her Excellency Ms. Anna Ekstrom, Minister from Sweden,
Deputy Chief Minister Shri Nitinbhai Patel ji,
Distinguished Nobel Laureates,
Dr. Goran Hansson, Vice-President of the Nobel Foundation,
Dear scientists,
Ladies and gentlemen!
 
Good evening!
 
Let me first congratulate  the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, the Government of  Gujarat and the Nobel Media, who have brought this exhibition to  Science City for five weeks. 
I declare the exhibition open and hope you will all have an opportunity to experience it.
 
The Nobel Prize is the world’s recognition at the highest level for creative ideas, thought and work on fundamental science.
 
Earlier, there have been  occasions when one, two or three Nobel Laureates have visited India and  had interactions with students and scientists in a limited manner. 
 
But, today, we are making history by having a galaxy of Nobel Laureates in Gujarat. 
 
I extend a hearty welcome  to all the Laureates present here. You are valued friends of India.  Some of you have been here earlier several times. One of you was born  here and actually grew up in Vadodara!
 
I am delighted to see so  many of our young students here today. I ask all of you to urge all your  friends and family to visit the Science City over the coming weeks. 
 
Our students will cherish  this extraordinary experience of interacting with you. It will inspire  them to undertake new and significant challenges that hold the key to  our shared  sustainable future.
 
I am very hopeful that  this exhibition and this Series will become a strong link between you  and our students, science-teachers and our scientists. 
 
My Government has a clear  vision of where we want India to be in the next 15 years. Science and  Technology is the pivot on which that vision will translate into  strategy and action.
 
Our vision in Science and Technology Is  to make sure that opportunity is available to all our youth. That  training and future preparedness should make our youth employable in the  best places. That India should be a great science destination. That we  should take major inspirational challenges such as deep sea exploration  and Cyber Systems.
 
We have a plan that will take this vision through action.
 
Our scientists have been  asked to develop programmes on science teaching in our schools across  the country. This will also involve training teachers.
 
At the next level they have been asked  to create new programmes both in skilling and high-tech training. 
 
These programmes will  make you employable in the new knowledge economy and make you effective  entrepreneurs and thinking scientists. You will be able to compete for  positions and jobs here and anywhere in the world.
 
Next, our scientists will link our laboratories in cities. You  can share ideas, seminars  and resources and equipment. This will allow us to do more and better collaborative science. 
Our science agencies will  expand science-driven entrepreneurship and commercialisation in a big  way in each state according to local needs. Your start-ups and industry  can then compete globally. 
 
These seeds must be planted this year and we will then see fruits come steadily. 
 
My young friends,  you are the future of India and the world. India offers an enabling and  unique opportunity of a large demographic dividend and the best  teachers.
 
Young students, you are  the streams that charge the wells of knowledge and expertise. Your  training and your future is what this is all about.
 
Thanks to science and  technology, the human race has flourished. Large numbers are enjoying a  quality of life unparalleled in human history. 
 
Yet India has a great challenge to raise many from poverty. You will be scientists soon and must not neglect this challenge.
 
The maturity of our  science will also be judged by a responsible treatment of our planet by  the wise use of Science and Technology.
 
 You will be scientists soon and the guardians of the planet. 
 
We must have clear outcomes from the Nobel Exhibition and the Science City. 
 
Globally, science &  technology has emerged as one of the major drivers of socio-economic  development. In the fast growing Indian economy, there are increasing  expectations for scientific interventions.
 
There are three outcomes I would like to see from the Nobel Prize series.
 
First,  follow up with students and their teachers. The students and teachers  here have come through a national ‘Ideathon’ competition and hail from  all over the country. Do not lose track of  them.
 
During the exhibition period, you may also have sessions for school teachers from all over Gujarat.
 
Second, stimulate entrepreneurship locally. There is a great entrepreneurial zeal amongst our youth.
 
Our science ministries  have incubators here in Gujarat. In the next five weeks, you should have  a workshop on how cutting edge science and technology-driven start-ups  can be boosted.
 
I am told that there are about ten Nobel Prize winning discoveries that have gone into the making of a smart phone.
 
Prize winning Physics can both save electricity bills and the planet. The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics was for the BLUE LED. This  came from basic research by three Japanese scientists Akasaki, Amano and  Nakamura. When combined with the previously known RED and GREEN LED,  white light devices can be made that last a hundred thousand hours. 
 
There are many such exciting discoveries being made that we can apply through enterprise.
 
Third, impact on society 
Many Nobel Prize winning discoveries have had a huge impact on our society through health and agriculture. 
 
For example, precision medicine using the tools of gene-technologies is now a reality. 
 
We must use this tool to study cancer, diabetes and infectious diseases. 
 
India is already a generics and  bio-similar leader, with a major hub in Gujarat, but we must now strive  to become a leader in new bio-tech discoveries as well.
 
I am happy that this Exhibition has been planned at the Science City which connects community to science. 
 
It is an ideal platform to engage citizens to learn about solutions to global challenges we face. 
 
We will strive to make  this Science City a truly attractive, world-class place for young  students and science teachers from all over the country and the world to  come and be inspired by the exhibits. Centre and State should  collaborate and take up this challenge this year.
 
My young friends! 
 
The Laureates represent  the peaks of science and you must learn from them. But remember that  the peak rises from great mountain ranges and does not stand alone.
 
You are the foundation  and the future of India. You should build new ranges from which the  peaks will arise. If we focus on the foundation, in our schools and  colleges and through teachers all miracles can happen. There will be  hundreds of peaks from India. But, if we neglect the hard work at the  base no peak will magically appear.
 
Be inspired and be  daring, have courage and be your own person and not imitative. That is  how our honoured guests succeeded and that is what you should learn from  them. 
 
I take this opportunity  to thank the Nobel Media Foundation, the Department of Biotechnology,  Government of India and the Government of Gujarat for organising such an  innovative programme.
I wish this exhibition a grand success and I am sure that you will all benefit from it.

                I  am delighted to be here at Gift City to inaugurate India’s first  international stock exchange, that is, the India International Exchange.  Indeed, it is a momentous occasion for India’s financial sector. 
As  you are aware, this project took shape in the year 2007. The vision was  to create a world class Finance and IT zone for India, to provide  services not only to India but the entire world.
In  those days, as now, wherever I went, I would meet some of the top  financial brains of those countries. Whether in New York, London,  Singapore, Hong Kong or Abu Dhabi, I would find many of them to be of  Indian origin. I was impressed by their understanding of the financial  world, and also their contributions to their adopted countries. 
I used to think, “How can we bring this talent back and at the same time, provide leadership to the entire financial world?”
Indians  have a long tradition in mathematics. India invented the concept of  ‘zero’ and the ‘decimal system’ more than two thousand years ago. It is  no accident that Indians are now at the forefront of Information Technology and Finance, both areas of knowledge where zero plays a crucial role!
When the Gift city was conceptualised, I  was Chief Minister of Gujarat. Technological progress had accelerated  manifold. We had world class talent of Indian origin working in India  and abroad. India had a leadership position in Information Technology.  Finance was being increasingly married to technology. It was becoming  very clear to us  that finance combined with technology, or “fintech” as it is sometimes  called, would be an important part of India’s future development. 
I  deliberated a lot with experts about how to make India, a thought  leader, in the field of Finance. It was clear that we would need to have  the best facilities and the ability to transact in  all markets in the world. Gift city was born out of this vision. Our  aim was to provide world class facilities to India’s world class talent  in finance and technology. Today, with the inauguration of this  Exchange, we have reached an important landmark in achieving that  vision.
I  had visited the Bombay Stock Exchange in June 2013 for a book launch.  At that time, I had invited BSE to set up a world beating International  Stock Exchange. In the year 2015, during the Vibrant Gujarat event, they  signed an MoU with Government of Gujarat. Today, I am delighted to be  here to inaugurate the new India International Exchange. It is an  important milestone not just for Gift city but for India, in creating 21st century infrastructure. 
I am told this exchange will trade in equity, commodities, currencies and interest rate derivatives in  the first phase. Later, it will trade equity instruments of Indian and  foreign companies. I am told Masala bonds will also be available for  trading here. Many more companies from Asia, Africa and Europe should be  able to raise funds from this important International Finance Centre.  This exchange is set to be among the fastest exchanges in the world with  most modern trading, clearing and settlement systems. India is in an  excellent time-zone between West and East. It can provide financial  services through the day and night to the entire world. The exchange, I  am told, will work twenty two hours a day, starting when the Japanese  markets start, and closing when US markets close. I am sure, this  exchange will set new standards for quality of service and speed of  transactions across time zones. 
This  exchange is part of the International Financial Services Centre, - IFSC  - at Gift city. The concept of an International Financial Services  Centre is simple but powerful. It aims to provide onshore talent with an  offshore technological  and regulatory framework. This is to enable Indian firms to compete on  an equal footing with offshore financial centres. Gift City IFSC will be  able to provide facilities and regulations comparable to any other  leading international finance centres in the world. 
It is not easy to create an offshore-like  environment in a large country like India with a huge domestic market.  India cannot be compared to small city states. Such countries have very  small local markets and hence can afford to have specially favourable  tax and regulatory regimes. Large countries cannot do the same. Creating  an offshore-like centre  within a large country like India, therefore did pose regulatory  challenges. I am glad that the Ministry of Finance, the Reserve Bank and  SEBI have found solutions to the regulatory issues.
There  has been criticism for long that a lot of trading, even in Indian  financial instruments, is currently taking place abroad. It is said that  India has stopped becoming the price setter for even some Indian  financial instruments. Gift city will be able to mitigate many of these criticisms. But my vision for Gift City is larger. My  vision  is that in ten years from now, Gift city should become the price setter  for at least a few of the largest traded instruments in the world,  whether in commodities, currencies, equities, interest rates or any  other financial instrument.
India  needs to create thirty crore new jobs over the next twenty years. It is  a huge endeavour. Skilled and well-paying jobs in the service sector  will have to be part of this job revolution. Indian youth can do it.  The  international exposure which our youth will be able to get from Gift  city will ensure that more and more of them will be able to join this  important field. I urge Indian companies, exchanges and regulators, to  help create a pool of experienced and world beating finance  professionals. They can work out of this great new city and provide  services to the entire world. Over next ten years, I expect this city to  generate several lakh jobs.
You  are aware of the importance I attach to the development of smart  cities. Gift city is the first ground up truly smart city in the  country. All the 100 smart cities will do well to understand how Gift  city has been able to create its underground infrastructure which can  compete with the best in the world. I have said before that India can  become a developed country in one generation. New cities will be  important in creating the new India of our dreams:
– a confident India 
– a prosperous India 
– an inclusive India 
– our India.
I hereby declare the India International Exchange open. I wish Gift city and the India International Exchange the very best. 
Thank you.

प्यारे भाईयों और बहनों,
हमारे  देश में रेलवे, देश के सामान्‍य जन से जुड़ी हुई व्‍यवस्‍था है। गरीब से  गरीब परिवार को भी रेलवे एक सहारा रही है। लेकिन दुर्भाग्‍य से रेलवे को  उसके नसीब पर छोड़ दिया गया है। और गत 30 वर्ष में खास करके जबकि दिल्‍ली  में मिली-जुली सरकारें रहती थीं और उसमें एक प्रकार से जो साथी दल रहते थे,  वे तब मंत्रिपरिषद में जुड़ते थे या सरकार को समर्थन देते थे अगर उनको रेल  मंत्रालय मिले तो। यानी एक प्रकार से रेल मंत्रालय सरकारें बनाने के लिए  रेवड़ी बांटने के लिए काम आता था। ये कड़वा सत्‍य है और उसका परिणाम ये आया  कि जिस भी राजनीतिक दल के व्‍यक्ति के पास रेलवे गई उसे रेलवे की चिंता कम  रही; बाकी क्‍या रहा होगा मुझे कहने की जरूरत नहीं है। 
इस  सरकार ने रेलवे को प्राथमिकता दी है, रेलवे का विस्‍तार हो; रेलवे का विकास  हो; रेलवे आधुनिक बने और रेलवे जन-सामान्‍य की जिंदगी में एक qualitative change के साथ मददगार कैसे बने? और आपने पिछले ढाई साल में रेलवे के कार्यकलाप को देखा होगा तो आपको ये ध्‍यान में आता होगा पहले की तुलना में बजट double कर दिया गया ये छोटी बात नहीं है।  और रेलवे का उपयोग गरीब से गरीब को भी होता है इसलिए इतना बड़ा बजट रेलवे  के लिए खर्च करने का तय किया। पहले अगर दिन में doubling का काम सालभर कुछ किलोमीटर होता था तो आज doubling का काम पहले से दो गुना, तीन गुना हो रहा है। 
पहले रेलवे में gaze conversion का काम Meter Gaze  से Broad Gaze  बनाना, Narrow Gaze से  Broad Gaze बनाना; ये काम आखिरी तबके में रहता था, उसको priority दी गई। पहले की तुलना में उसको अनेक गुना अधिक सफलता पाई। रेलवे डीजल इंजन से चले, कोयले से चले, environment के प्रश्‍न, डीजल से चले तो दुनिया भर से विदेश से डीजल import करना पड़े। Environment की भी रक्षा हो; विदेशी मुद्रा भी न जाए; डीजल से रेलवे को जल्‍दी से जल्‍दी Electrification की तरफ कैसे ले जाया जाए; बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में, तेज गति से आज रेल लाइनों का Electrification हो रहा है, रेल इंजन Electric इंजन बनाने का काम हो रहा है। आजाद हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में सबसे बड़ा Foreign Direct Investment रेलवे के क्षेत्र में आया है और दो बड़े Loco Engineering Manufacture के काम के लिए वो काम आने वाला है। भविष्‍य में वो पूरे रेलवे की गति बदलने वाले इंजन बनाने का काम होने वाला है। 
इन सारी बातों के साथ-साथ सफाई से ले करके रेलवे में सुविधा उसको बल दिया गया, Bio-Toilet;  वरना हम जानते हैं कि स्‍टेशन पर रेल की पटरियां गंदगी से भरी रहती हैं।  बहुत तेजी से उस पर काम, बल दिया, बहुत बड़ा खर्चा है। लेकिन ये तत्‍काल न  दिखे लेकिन लम्‍बे अर्से तक बड़ा लाभ करने वाला है। 
स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य  की दृष्टि से एक परिवर्तन का प्रयास, उस दिशा में बड़ा बल दिया है। रेल की  गति कैसे बढ़े? वरना पहले से चल रहा है चलती थी, चलती थी; बैठे हैं उतर जा  सकते हैं फिर दौड़ करके चढ़ जा सकते हैं; ये सब बदला जा सकता है। Special Mission Mode में काम चल रहा है कि Exiting जो व्‍यवस्‍थाएं हैं उसमें क्‍या सुधार करें ताकि रेल की गति बढ़ाई जाए। Technology में परिवर्तन ला रहे हैं, विश्‍व भर से Technology की दृष्टि से लोगों को जोड़ रहे हैं कि safety एक बहुत बड़ी चिन्‍ता का विषय है और चुनौती भी है। 
विश्‍व में Technological परिवर्तन इतना हुआ है कि रेलवे को सुरक्षित बनाया जा सकता है। बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में बजट खर्च करके compartment हो तो उसको भी किस प्रकार से सुरक्षा दी जाए उसके लिए चिन्‍ता और व्‍यवस्‍थाएं आगे बढ़ रही हैं। Freight Corridor, रेल दुनिया में 70 प्रतिशत cargo, माल-सामान रेल से जाता है, 30 प्रतिशत रोड से जाता है। हमीं एक ऐसे देश हैं कि जहां 15-20% रेल से जाता है, 70-80% रोड से जाता है। और जब रोड से Cargo जाता है तो बहुत महंगा हो जाता है। अगर कोई सोचे कि गुजरात में पैदा होने वाला नमक जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर तक जाएं और By Road जाएं तो वो इतना महंगा हो जाएगा कोई खरीद नहीं सकता। और इसलिए रेल के माध्‍यम से जितना ज्‍यादा Cargo Transport होगा, गरीब से गरीब व्‍यक्ति को सस्‍ता मिलेगा। और इसलिए Cargo को बढ़ाने की दिशा में काम चल रहा है। 
मैंने रेलवे के लोगों को काम दिया था आते ही, मैंने कहा नमक जो रेलवे का Container होता है उसकी अपना weight 16 टन होता है और फिर उसमें मुश्किल से दो टन, तीन टन नमक आता है, मैंने कहा 16 टन का Container 6 टन का हो जाता है क्‍या? अगर वो  6 टन का हो जाए तो 12 टन नमक जाएगा और नमक जाएगा तो नमक जहां पहुंचेगा  वहां मुफ्त में मिलना शुरू हो जाएगा और नमक पैदा करने वालों का नमक भी बहुत  जल्‍दी पहुंच पाएगा। रेलवे ने design तैयार की है, नमक ले जाने के लिए कैसे Container हों ताकि weight कम हो। यानी एक-एक चीज को बारीकी से बदलाव करने की दिशा में रेलवे कार्यरत है। 
और  मुझे विश्‍वास है कि बहुत तेज गति से रेल बदल जाएगी। सामान्‍य मानवी को  सुविधा तो बढ़ेगी, दूर-सुदूर इलाकों में रेलवे पहुंचेगी, भारत के बंदरों  (बंदरगाहों) के साथ रेल जुड़ेगी, भारत की खदानों के साथ रेल जुड़ेगी, भारत  के उपभोक्‍ता के साथ रेल जुड़ेगी लेकिन साथ-साथ आर्थिक दृष्टि से भी। रेलवे  स्‍टेशन जो भी हैं, Heart of the City में हैं। वो जमीन इतनी valuable है  लेकिन आसमान खाली पड़ा है। तो बड़ी समझदारी का विषय है कि भले ही नीचे रेल  जाए अरे ऊपर एक दस मंजिला, 25 मंजिला चीजें बना दो, वहां पर Mall हो, Theater हो, Hotel हो, बाजार हो, रेल के ऊपर चलता रहेगा; नीचे रेल चलती जाएगी। जगह का double उपयोग होगा, रेल को Income बढ़ेगी, Investment करने वाले Investment करने आएंगे। गुजरात में हम लोगों ने सफल प्रयोग किया, Bus station का Public private partnership Model के आधार पर development किया। आज गरीब से गरीब बस अड्डे पर जाता है, उसको वही सुविधा मिलती है जो अमीर लोग Airport पर जाते हैं, वो गुजरात ने करके दिखाया है। 
आने वाले दिनों में हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में हजारों रेलवे स्‍टेशन हैं, जिसका इस प्रकार का Development हो सकता है। आप सबको याद होगा जिस दिन ये महात्‍मा मन्दिर का शिलान्‍यास किया था, Golden Jubilee Year था गुजरात का, 2010 में; और पहली  मई के दिन इसी जगह पर बोलते हुए मैंने कहा था कि महात्‍मा मन्दिर आज जो  नींव डाली गई है और मैं साफ देख रहा हूं एक दिन ऐसा आएगा जब इसी महात्‍मा  मन्दिर में विश्‍व के दिग्‍गज लोग बैठ करके विश्‍व शांति की चर्चा करते  होंगे। 
महात्‍मा  गांधी के नाम से जुड़ा हुआ महात्‍मा मंदिर, लेकिन उस महात्‍मा मंदिर को तो  हमने बना दिया इतना तेजी से बना दिया, अब उन व्‍यवस्‍थाओं की जरूरत है कि  इस प्रकार के दुनिया के दिग्‍गज आ करके ठहरें, ये रेलवे स्‍टेशन पर जो होटल  बन रहा है इसमें आने वाले लोग स्‍वाभाविक रूप से महात्‍मा मंदिर के Convention Centre का उपयोग करेंगे; रुकेंगे यहां meeting करेंगे वहां और Helipad Ground पर प्रदर्शनी होगी। यानी एक प्रकार से पूरा Corridor, रेलवे हो, महात्‍मा मंदिर हो, Helipad का इलाका हो, ये पूरा का पूरा एक पूरे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की business activity का एक magnetic centre की संभावना मैं देख रहा हूं। और इसलिए रेलवे स्‍टेशन पर बन रहा Infrastructure रेलवे तो जा ही रही थी, जमीन पड़ी  थी लेकिन उसका इसके साथ जोड़ करके उपयोग करना और जिसके कारण महात्‍मा मंदिर  पर 365 दिन में 300 दिन तक busy रहे, ऐसी उसके साथ सीधी-सीधी  संभावना बनी है। विश्‍व स्‍तर के कोई कार्यक्रम बनने हैं उसके लिए भी  संभावना इसके साथ पैदा हो रही है और रेलवे के विकास का भी ये आधार बनती है।  
ये  हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का पहला प्रकल्‍प आज गांधीनगर शुरू हो रहा है। आने वाले  दिनों में हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के और स्‍थान पर भी आगे बढ़ेगा। हमारे सुरेश प्रभु  जी ने रेलवे स्‍टेशनों पर Wi-Fi की सुविधा दी है। Digital India का जो सपना है उसका पूरा करने की  दिशा में काम हो रहा है। कुछ लोगों को ये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के गरीब लोग हैं  उनको क्‍या समझ और आपको हैरानी होगी भारत की रेलवे में 60-70 प्रतिशत लोग Online Ticket Purchase करते हैं, Sixty-Seventy Percent हुआ? Online Ticket Purchase करते हैं, ये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की ताकत है। 
सामान्‍य मानवी जो रेल जाता है वो भी आज Online Railway की Ticket booking करा रहा है और ले रहा है। Wi-Fi के कारण अनुभव है कि आज हिन्‍दुस्तान में और विश्‍व के सब लोगों का analyze है, Google के लोग आए तो वो चर्चा कर रहे थे, भारत के रेलवे स्‍टेशन पर Wi-Fi की जो capacity है वो शायद दुनिया में सबसे ज्‍यादा है, स्‍टेशन के इलाके में। और उसका परिणाम ये हुआ है कि बहुत सारे Students जो Online पढ़ाई करना पसंद करते हैं, चीजें download कर-करके education के लिए उपयोग करते हैं, वो कोशिश करते हैं कि रेलवे स्‍टेशन पर पहुंचा जाए और अपने Computer, Laptop पर  बैठ करके वो मुफ्त का काम हो जाता है और उसको दुनिया की जो चीज चाहिए,  उपलब्‍ध हो जाती है। यानी एक व्‍यवस्‍था कैसे बदलाव ला सकती है इसका उदाहरण  ढाई साल के अंदर हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की रेलवे ने करके दिखाया है। 
उसी  के तहत आज गुजरात में पूरे देश के लिए उपयोगी ऐसा एक प्रकल्‍प का प्रारम्‍भ  हो रहा है जो आने वाले दिनों में हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के और शहरों में भी होगा  और रेलवे को नई ऊंचाइयों पर ले जाना, रेलवे को सामान्‍य मानवी की सुविधा का  एक माध्‍यम बनाना और रेलवे है जो देश को गति भी देती है, रेलवे है जो देश  को प्र‍गति भी देती है। मुझे मैं गुजरात के लोगों को, गांधीनगर के लोगों को  और आज Vibrant Summit की पूर्व संध्‍या पर ये नजराना देते हुए बहुत गर्व और संतोष का भाव अनुभव करता हूं। 
बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                Dear brothers and sisters,

In our country, Railways is inseparable from common man. It has been a support for the poorest of the poor. Unfortunately, the Railways has been left to its destiny. In the last 30 years, when there were coalition governments in Delhi, the coalition partners only supported the government when they were allocated the Railway ministry. In a way, the Railway ministry was used as a dole for formation of coalition governments. It’s a bitter truth. As a result of it whosoever from any political party held the Railway Ministry was least bothered about Railways. I don’t have to say what his concerns have been.

This government has accorded priority to Railways, railways should be expanded; should be developed, should become modern and how it could bring about qualitative change in the life of the common man? If you have followed the working of Railways in the last two and a half years then you would be aware that the railway budget has been doubled, it’s not a small thing. Such a huge fund has been allocated for the Railways because it is being used by the poorest of the poor. Earlier the doubling of track of a few kilometers was done in a day, now we have been doing two or three times more than that. Earlier the gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, from narrow gauge to broad gauge, this work was accorded the last priority, now it has been given the primacy. We have been doing it many more times than what was done earlier. If the Railway uses diesel engine, if it uses coal fired engines then question of environment protection arises, if it uses diesel engine then diesel is required to be imported from abroad. How to protect environment; how to save foreign reserves; how to rapidly move Railways from diesel to electrification; today railway tracks have been electrified at a very large scale and at a fast pace and electric rail engines have been manufactured. In the history of independent India, the biggest Foreign Direct Investment has come in the Railway sector. Investment is coming for setting up two large Loco Engineering manufacturing units which will build engines and these engines will speed up the entire rail network.

In addition to all these things, we have given emphasis to cleanliness and providing facilities in Railways; bio-toilet; otherwise, we all know that railway tracks at Railway stations were full of filth. It’s a huge expenditure, we have worked in that direction very fast, emphasized on it, it’s a big expenditure. Results may not be visible immediately but it will really help in the long run.

We have emphasized, we have tried from the point of view of hygiene, from the point of view of health. How to increase the speed of rails? Otherwise, these things were very common that rail was moving, it was moving, people could alight from it and then they could board again; all these things can be changed. We have been working in special mission mode that how to improve, how to modify the existing system to increase the speed of trains. We have been changing the technology, associating people from all over the world from the point of view of technology so that safety which a big cause of concern and challenge as well.

There is so much technological advancement in the world that Railway journeys can be made safer. We have been moving forward in that direction by spending huge amount of money to make the coaches safer, we have been moving forward to address those concerns, to create those systems. Freight Corridor, on an average 70% of the world cargo is moved through railways and 30% by road. India is the only country where 70-80% cargo is moved by road and only 15-20% is moved by Railways. And it is very costly if the cargo is moved by road. If someone thinks that the salt produced in Gujarat is to be transported to Jammu and Kashmir and that too by road then it will become so costly that no one could purchase it. And therefore if more cargo is transported by the Railways goods will become cheaper for the poor. That’s why we have been working in the direction of increasing the capacity to transport cargo.

I have assigned a task to the Railways soon after joining the government, I told them that the Railway container that weighs around 16 ton, could hardly carry two-three ton salt. I asked them can we reduce the weight of the Railway container to 6 ton from present 16 ton? If its weight can be reduced to 6 ton then it can carry 12 ton salt then wherever the salt is supplied it will become almost free and salt producers can supply their salt very fast. Railways has prepared a design of container for transporting salt so that its weight could be reduced. I mean that railway is working in a very detailed manner to transform everything.

And I am confident that Railways will rapidly transform itself. Not only the facilities for common man will be increased but the railways will also reach the remotest corners of the country, it will connect the Indian ports, it will connect the Indian mines, it will connect all the users and it will also connect economically. Railway stations are located in the heart of cities. That land is extremely valuable but the space above the building is not being used. It’s common sense that even if the train passes through on the ground but you can construct 10 floors, 25 floors, you can construct malls, theater, hotels and markets, these things will be operational over the train tracks, trains will continue to pass beneath the. There will dual use of the place, income of railways will be supplemented and investors will come to invest. We have successfully implemented this thing Gujarat, we developed bus stations on the model of public private partnership. Today, if the poorest of the poor gets the same facilities, that are available to rich people at the airports, when he visits the bus station; we have shown this thing in Gujarat.

In the coming days, thousands of railway stations can be developed in this manner. You would remember that the day I laid the foundation stone for Mahatma temple, it was the golden jubilee year of Gujarat in 2010; and while speaking at this place on the first May I had said that I can clearly see that the foundation that is laid for Mahatma Mandir here there will be a day when the eminent people of the world would be discussing the world peace here.

We have constructed a Mahatma Temple associated with the name of Mahatma Gandhi, we constructed it so fast but it requires those facilities that are required for the stay of the world’s eminent persons, the hotel that is being constructed at the railway station, people staying in it will naturally use the convention centre of Mahatma Temple; they will stay here and have meetings and exhibitions will be organized at the helipad ground. In a way, I see the potential of this entire corridor of railway, Mahatma temple, the area of helipad, all this area become the magnetic centre for business activity of India. And therefore the infrastructure that is created at this place, the trains were passing through anyway but the land was lying unused but now it can be used in a manner that Mahatma Temple can be kept engaged for 300 days out 365 days, the clear possibility of this thing is emerging. Several global programs is to be organized and a possibility is emerging for them to be linked with it and it also becomes a basis for the development of railways.

This is the country’s first project beginning in Gandhinagar today. In the coming days, it will be taken forward in many other places in the country. Our Suresh Prabhu Ji has provided Wi-Fi facility at railway stations. The work has been done to realize the dream of Digital India. Some people think that India is a country of poor people, what would they know, but you would be surprised to know that 60-70% railway travelers book their ticket online, sixty seventy percent purchase ticket online this is the strength of India.

An ordinary person who undertakes railway journey today books his ticket online Because of Wi-Fi people in India as well as across the world can analyse. When some Google employees came on a visit to India they were discussing that the Wi-Fi faacility available at the railway stations in India perhaps is the highest in the world. And as a result of that the students who want to read and study online, those who download things for education, they try to reach railway station and use free internet on their laptops and their computers. Therefore, in the last two and a half years Indian railways has set the example of how one thing can bring about changes by accomplishing this thing. Under that scheme today a project is beginning in Gujarat that will be useful for the entire country, it will be extended to other cities of the country in the coming days to take railways to new heights, to make railways a medium for providing facilities to common man and it is the railways that lends progress and speed to the nation.

Today I feel a sense of a great pride and satisfaction while dedicating this thing to the people of Gujarat, to the people of Gandhinagar on the eve of Vibrant Summit.

Thank you very much.

                Excellencies and friends,
To begin with, let me offer our deepest condolences to the people and government of Portugal on the passing away of Mr. Mario Soares, former President, Prime Minister, a great leader of Portugal and a global states-man. He was the architect of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Portugal. We stand with Portugal in full support in this hour of grief.
Your Excellency, the Vice President of Suriname, Shri Michael Ashwin Adhin,  Excellency the Prime Minister of Portugal, Dr. Antonio Costa,
Shri Vaju Bhai wala, Governor of Karnaktaka Shri Siddaramaiah ji,
Chief Minister of Karnataka, Honourable Ministers, Dignitaries from India and Abroad,
And the most important of all, the global family of overseas Indians.
It is a great pleasure for me to welcome all of you on this 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas. Thousands of you have travelled from far-off lands to join us here today. Millions more are connected through digital platforms.
This day is a celebration to mark the return to India of one of the greatest Pravasi’s- Mahatma Gandhi.
ये एक ऐसा पर्व है जिस में एक प्रकार से host भी आप ही हैं, guest भी आप ही हैं। यह पर्व  एक ऐसा पर्व है जिसमें उसकी विदेशमें रहने वाली संतान से मिलने का अवसर  है। अपनों को अपनों से मिलना, अपने लिए नहीं सबके लिए मिलना। इस event कीअसली पहचान  आन-बान-शान जो कुछ भी है आप सब लोग हैं। आप का इस पर्व में सम्मिलित होना हमारे लिए बहुत-बहुत गर्वकी बात है। आप सब का तहे दिल से स्वागत है | 
 
We are celebrating this event in the beautiful city of Bengaluru. I wish to thank the Chief Minister, to the Ramayya Ji and his entire government for his assistance and efforts in organizing this event/ and making it a big success.
It is my particular pleasure to welcome Excellency the Prime Minister of Portugal, the Vice President of Suriname, the honourable Ministers from Malaysia and Mauritius to the event.
Their achievements, the name they have earned in their own societies and globally, are a great inspiration for all of us. It also reflects the success, glory and enterprise of Indian diaspora the world over. There are over 30million Overseas Indians living abroad. Their footprint is all over the world. But, Indians abroad are valued not just for their strength in numbers. They are respected for the contributions they make - to India and to the societies and countries where they live. In foreign lands and communities across the globe, irrespective of the path they take, and the goals they pursue, the Indian diaspora represents the best of Indian culture, ethos and values. Their hard-work, discipline, law-abiding and peace loving nature are role models for other immigrant communities abroad.
आप की प्रेरणा कई प्रकार की है, उद्देश्य अनेक हैं, आपके मार्ग भिन्‍न–भिन्‍न हैं, हर किसी की मंजिल भी अलग है लेकिन हमसबके भीतर एक ही भाव विश्‍व है, और वो भाव जगत है  भारतीयता। प्रवासी भारतीय जहां रहे उस धरती को उन्‍होंने कर्मभूमिमाना, और जहां से आए उसे मर्मभूमि माना। आज आप उस कर्मभूमि की सफलताओं को, उसकी गठरी बांध करके उस मर्मभूमि मेंपधारे हैं जहां से आपको, आपके पूर्वजों को, अविरत् प्रेरणा मिलती रही है। प्रवासी भारतीय जहां रहे वहांका विकास किया औरजहां के हैं वहां भी अपना अप्रतिम रिश्‍ता जोड़ करके रखा, हो सके उतना योगदान किया।
Friends, for my governments and for me personally, engagement with the overseas Indian community has been a key area of priority.  I have met and spoken to hundreds of thousands of our brothers and sisters during my travels abroad – in USA, UK, Australia, South Africa, UAE, Qatar, Singapore, Fiji, China, Japan, South Korea, Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Malaysia.
As a result, as a result of our sustained and systematic out-reach, there is new energy, keen desire and strong drive among Indian Diaspora to connect more extensively and deeply with India’s social and economic transformation.
The remittance of close to sixty nine billion dollars annually by the overseas Indians makes an invaluable contribution to the Indian economy.
प्रवासी भारतीयों में देश के विकास के लिए अदम्य इच्छाशक्ति है; वे देश की प्रगति में सहयात्री हैं। Co-traveler हैं। हमारीविकास यात्रा में आप हमारे एक Valuable साथी हैं, Partner हैं, stakeholder हैं। कभी चर्चा हुआ करती थी Brain-Drain. हरकोई सवाल पूछता था Brain-Drain, और मैं उस समय लोगों को कहता था; तब तो न मुख्‍यमंत्री था न प्रधानमंत्री था; जब लोगकहते थे कि Brain-Drain, Brain-Drain हो रहा था तो मैं कह रहा था क्‍या बुद्धु लोग ही यहां बचे हैं क्‍या? लेकिन आज मैं बड़ेविश्‍वास के साथ कहना चाहता हूं हम लोग जो Brain-Drain की चर्चा करते थे, वर्तमान सरकार के initiatives उस Brain-Drain में से भी Brain-Gain के लिए है। हम Brain-Drain को Brain-Gain  में बदलना चाहते हैं, और वो सब आप सबकीसहभागिता से ही संभव होने वाला है, और होके रहने वाला है, ये मेरा विश्‍वास है। 
NRIs’ and PIOs’ have made outstanding contributions to their chosen fields. Among them, there are politicians of stature, scientists of repute, outstanding doctors, brilliant educationists, economists, musicians, famous philanthropists, journalists, bankers, engineers and lawyers. And, sorry! Did I mention our well known Information Technology professionals? Tomorrow, 30 overseas Indians will receive from the President, the prestigious Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards, which recognize contributions made by them in various fields, both in India and abroad.
Friends, E-respective of their background and profession, the welfare and safety of all Indians abroad is our top priority. For this, we are strengthening the entire eco-system of our administrative arrangements. Whether it is on loss of their passports; need for legal advice, medical assistance, shelter, or even transportation of mortal remains to India. I have directed all Indian embassies to be proactive to address problems of Indian nationals abroad.
 
Our response to the needs of the Indian nationals overseas is defined by Accessibility, sensitivity, speed and promptness. 24 by 7, help-lines by Indian Embassies; ‘Open House’ meetings with Indian nationals; consular camps; twitter seva for passport services; and use of social media platforms for immediate access; are some of the measures that we have put in place  to convey a clear message  that we are there for you when you need us.
The security of Indian nationals abroad is of utmost importance to us. हम पासपोर्ट का colour नहीं देखते हैं, खून कारिश्‍ता सोचते हैं।  In institutions of distress faced by Indian nationals, we have reached out to ensure their safety, rescue and repatriation. Our External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj ji, has particularly been proactive and prompt in reaching out to distressed Indians abroad using social media.
Under Operation “संकट मोचन” in July 2016, we evacuated over one hundred and fifty Indian nationals from South Sudan within 48 hours.  Prior to that, we evacuated several thousands of our citizens from conflict situations in Yemen in well-coordinated, smooth and swift co-operations. And the last two years – 2014 and 2016, we facilitated the repatriation of over ninety thousand Indian nationals from nearly 54 countries. Through the Indian Community Welfare Fund we have assisted more than eighty thousand Indian nationals abroad who were in contingency situations.
Our aim is that for every Indian abroad, home should never be far away. हम लोग छोटे तब सुनते थे, मामा का घरकितना दूर तो बोले दीया जले उतना दूर। भारत कितना दूर, उसको लगना चाहिए दीया जले उतना दूर, इतनी निकटता उसकोमहसूस होनी चाहिए। दुनिया के किसी भी देश में क्‍यों न रहता हो, उसको ये अपनापन महसूस होना चाहिए।  For those workers who seek economic opportunities abroad, our effort is to provide maximum facilitation and ensure least inconvenience. Our motto is: ""सुरक्षित जाएँ, प्रशिक्षित जाएँ, विश्‍वास के साथ जाएँ’’. For this, we have streamlined our systems and taken several measures to safeguard emigration of Indian workers. About six lakhEngineers emigrants have been granted  Emigration Clearance online for overseas employment through registered recruitment agents.  Online registration of foreign employers on e-Migrate portal has been made mandatory.
 
And, the grievances, complaints and petitions of the migrant workers continue to be addressed online through e-Migrate and “MADAD” platforms. We are also taking strict action against illegal recruitment agents in India. Prosecution sanctions by CBI or State Police against illegal agents; and increase in the amount of Bank Guarantee deposited by the recruiting agents from Rs.20 lakhs to Rs.50 lakhs; our some of the steps in this direction. To ensure that the migrating Indian workers enjoy better economic opportunities, we will shortly launch a skill development program - the “Pravasi Kaushal Vikas Yojana” targeted at Indian youth who seek overseas employment.
कभी-कभी जो पहली बार विदेश जाते हैं, ज्‍यादा पढ़े-लिखे नहीं हैं; अगर उनका वहां के देश की आवश्‍यकता के अनुसार यहीं परउसका 15 दिन, एक महीने का कोर्स हो, उसकी development हो। मान लीजिए वो किसी देश में house keeping के काम केलिए जा रहा है, अगर यहां उसकी training होगी तो बड़े विश्‍वास के साथ जायेगा। और इसलिए ये ‘’प्रवासी कौशल विकासयोजना’’ भारत से बाहर जाने वाले लोग एक value-added अवस्‍था में जाएं जिसके कारण एक नया वश्विास पैदा हो, उस‍ दिशामें हम प्रयास कर रहे हैं, और उससे मुझे लगता है जो गरीब तबके के लोग छोटे-छोटे काम करने के लिए जा रहे हैं, उनको ज्‍यादालाभ होगा। कुछ लोगों को उस देश के कुछ sentences हैं, कुछ उस देश के manners हैं, कुछ cultural चीजें सीखने की जरूरीहोती हैं। वो भी कितने ही पढ़े-लिखे व्‍यक्ति क्‍यों न हों, उसको काम आती हैं; उस पर भी हम बल दे रहे हैं, जिसको हम soft-skill कहते हैं। तो ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍थाएं जिसके कारण भारत का व्‍यक्ति विश्‍व में पैर रखते ही उसको कुछ भी पराया न लगे; औरों को भीवो अपना लगे और उसका आत्‍मविश्‍वास उस ऊंचाइयों को पार करने वाला हो जैसे वो सालों से उस भूमि को जानता है; वहां केलोगों को जानता है; वो तुरंत ही अपने आपको set कर सकता है, तो उस रूप में उसकी चिन्‍ता, व्‍यवस्‍था हम कर रहे हैं।
Friends. We have a special bond with the Indian Diaspora which is living in the Girmitiya countries – who are deeply and emotionally attached with their place of origin. We are aware of difficulties faced by Persons of Indian Origin from these countries in obtaining an OCI Card if they moved abroad four or five generations ago. We acknowledge their concerns and have made efforts to address these issues.
I am glad to announce that starting with Mauritius, we are working to put in place new procedures and documentation requirements so that the descendants of Girmitiyas from this country could become eligible for OCI Cards. We remain committed to addressing similar difficulties of PIOs in Fiji, Reunion Islands, Suriname, Guyana and other Caribbean States.
Like my request at the last Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, I would again encourage all PIO Card holders to convert their PIO Cards to OCI Cards. मैं बोलता रहता हूं, आग्रह भी करता हूं,  लेकिन मैं जानता हूं कि आप लोग बहुत व्‍यस्‍त हैंऔर इसीलिए ये शायद काम रह जाता है। तो आपकी इस व्‍यस्‍तता को देखते हुए, I am happy to announce  that we have extended the deadline for such conversion  from 31 December 2016, until June 30, 2017 without any penalty. From least of January this year, beginning with airports in Delhi and Bengaluru, we have also set up special counters at immigration points in our airports for OCI Card holders. 
Friends, Today, there are about 7 Lakh Indian students/ pursuing academic programs abroad.  और मुझे भलीभाति ज्ञात हैकि विदेश मे रह रहा हर भारतीय, भारत की प्रगति से जुड़ने के लए आतुर है। उनका ज्ञान, विज्ञान और भारत केज्ञान का मिलन, भारत कोआर्थिक प्रगति को असीम उंचाईयों पर ले जायेगा।
मेरा सदैव यह प्रयास और विश्वास रहा है कि सक्षम तथा successful प्रवासियो को भारत की विकास गाथा से जुड़ने का सम्पूर्णमौका मिलना चाहिए, खास तौर से विज्ञान तथा तकनीकी क्षेत्रों में and technology के field में।
इसके लिए हमने कई कदम उठाये है. One of them is that the Department of Science and Technology is launching Visiting Adjunct Joint Research Faculty or VAJRA scheme which enables NRIs and overseas scientific community to participate and contribute to research and development in India. Under the scheme an overseas Indian can work for one to three months in an institution in India. And, that too, at good terms और सब सेमहत्पूर्ण है कि प्रवासी भारतीय इसके द्वारा देश की प्रगति का एक अहम् हिस्सा बन सकता है।  
Friends, it is my firm belief that connect between India and over-seas Indians should be sustained and enriching for both. To meet this goal, in October last year, महात्मा गाँधी की जन्मदिन पर, I had the honour of inaugurating the Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra in New Delhi. This Kendra is dedicated to the over-seas Indian community. We want it to become a symbol of the global migration, experiences, struggles, achievements and aspirations of the Indian Diaspora. I am confident that the Kendra will become another important platform for crystallizing ongoing efforts of the government to redefine its engagement with the over-seas Indian community.
Friends, हमारे प्रवासी भारतीय कई पीढि़यों से विदेशो में है। हर पीढ़ी के अनुभव ने भारत को और सक्षम बनाया है. जैसे नएपौधे पर हमारे भीतर अलग से एक स्नेह उभर आता है, उसी तरह विदेश में रह युवा प्रवासी भारतीय भी हमारे लिए अनमोल हैं, विशेष हैं। हम प्रवासी भारतीयों की युवा पीढ़ीयों से, young Pravasis से करीबी और मज़बूत और संपर्क और गहरा बनानाचाहते हैं। 
To provide the young Indian-origin youth  an opportunity to visit their Motherland and reconnect with their Indian roots, culture, and heritage– we have expanded the Government’s Know India Program, under which for the first time, six groups of young over-seas Indians are visiting India this year.
I am very happy to know that 160 of these young over-seas Indians are here today to participate in the PravasiBharatiya Divas. A special welcome to the young Pravasis– I hope that on returning to your respective countries, you will remain connected with us, wherever you are, and visit again, again and again India. Last year, the first edition of the online quiz competition for young overseas Indians called “Bharat ko Jaano” saw participation of more than 5000 young NRIs and PIOs.  In the second edition this year, I hope to see the participation of at least fifty thousand young overseas Indians.
Young Friends, will you please help me in this mission? Will you please help me in this mission? Are you ready to work with me? Then why we can stop at 50 thousands?
Friends, आज भारत एक नयी प्रगतिशील दिशा की और अग्रसर है। ऐसी प्रगति जो न केवल आर्थिक है अपितु सामाजिक, राजनैतिक, और शासकीय भी है। आर्थिक क्षेत्र में, PIOs तथा NRIs के लिए FDI norms पूरी तरह liberalized है और FDI कीमेरी दो परिभाषाएं हैं, One definition is FDI means foreign direct investment, and second is first develop India. Investments by PIOs on non-repatriation basis; and by companies, trusts and partnerships owned by them, are now deemed to be domestic investment at par with investments made by resident Indians. हमारे कई ऐसाprograms हैं, जैसे Swachh Bharat, Mission Digital India, Start up India, जिनसे प्रवासी भारतीय भारत के सामान्यव्यक्ति के प्रगति से सीधाजुड़ सकते हैं. There are some amongst you who like to contribute in businesses and investments. Others may feel more comfortable supporting through contributions made to Swachh Bharat, Namami Gange and others.
Some others may feel motivated to spare their valuable time and efforts in volunteering in India helping the under-privileged or contributing to capacity building programs in various sectors.
We welcome all your efforts that seek to strengthen India’s partnership with the over-seas Indian community. I also invite you to visit the exhibition in the Pravasi Bharatiya congention (PBD Convention) which gives you a glimpse of some of the flagship programs that we have been implementing and see how you can partner with us.
Friends, यहां आने के बाद आपने सुना होगा, देखा होगा  हमने भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ, काले धन के खिलाफ corruption औरblack money के खिलाफ  एक बहुत बड़ा  बीड़ा उठाया है।  black money तथा corruption  हमारी राजनीति तथा देश तथासमाज तथा शासन को धीरे, धीरे, धीरे, धीरे  खोखला करता रहा है। और ये दुर्भाग्‍य है कि black money के कुछ  राजनैतिकपुजारी हमारे प्रयासों को जनता के विरोधी दर्शाते हैं। corruption  और काले धन को समाप्त करने में भारत सरकार की नीतियोंका जो समर्थन प्रवासी भारतीयों ने किया है उसके लिए मैं आपका अभिनन्दन करता हूँ, आपका साधुवाद करता हूं, आपकाधन्‍यवाद करता हूं।
Friends, Finally, I would like to say that as Indians, we have a common heritage that brings us all together. And, no matter where we may be around? Where we may be around the globe, it is in that common bond that we are strong. और इसलिए मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो आपने जो सपने संजो के रखे हुए हैं, आपके सपने हमारे संकल्‍प हैं और हमसब मिल करके उन सपनों को साकार करने के लिए अगर व्‍यवस्‍था में बदलाव जरूरी हो, अगर कानून नियमों में बदलाव कीजरूरत हो, साहसिक कदम उठाने की जरूरत हो, हर एक को साथ लेकर चलने के लिए जो कुछ भी करना पड़े, करने कीआवश्‍यकता हो ये सब करते हुए मैं विश्‍वास से कहता हूं 21वीं सदी हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की सदी है। बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद ।
Thank You and Jai Hind.

                Excellencies and friends,

 

To begin with, let me offer our deepest condolences to the people and government of Portugal on the passing away of Mr. Mario Soares, former President, Prime Minister, a great leader of Portugal and a global statesman. He was the architect of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Portugal. We stand with Portugal in full support in this hour of grief.

Your Excellency, the Vice President of Suriname, Shri Michael Ashwin Adhin,  Excellency the Prime Minister of Portugal, Dr. Antonio Costa, Shri Vaju Bhai wala, Governor of Karnaktaka, Shri Siddaramaiah ji, Chief Minister of Karnataka, Honourable Ministers, dignitaries from India and abroad, and the most important of all, the global family of overseas Indians.

It is a great pleasure for me to welcome all of you on this 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas. Thousands of you have travelled from far off lands to join us here today. Millions more are connected through digital platforms.

This day is a celebration to mark the return to India of one of the greatest Pravasis,Mahatma Gandhi.

This is such an occasion where in a way you are both the host and the guest. This is such a festival where one meets his children settled abroad, your own people meeting you, the meeting is not just for you but for all. You are the real identity of this event, its real glory and  its real prestige. Your participation in this event is a matter of great pride for us. I heartily welcome all of you.

We are celebrating this event in the beautiful city of Bengaluru. I wish to thank the Chief Minister, Shri Siddaramaiah Ji and his entire government for their assistance and efforts in organizing this event and making it a big success.

It is my particular pleasure to welcome his Excellency the Prime Minister of Portugal, the Vice President of Suriname, the honourable Ministers from Malaysia and Mauritius to the event.

Their achievements, the name they have earned in their own societies and globally are a great inspiration for all of us. It also reflects the success, glory and enterprise of Indian Diaspora the world over. There are over 30 million Overseas Indians living abroad. Their footprint is all over the world. But, Indians abroad are valued not just for their strength in numbers. They are respected for the contributions they make  to India and to the societies and countries where they live. In foreign lands and communities across the globe, irrespective of the path they take, and the goals they pursue, the Indian Diaspora represents the best of Indian culture, ethos and values. Their hard-work, discipline, law-abiding and peace loving nature are role models for other immigrant communities abroad.

Your passions are different, your paths are different, your purposes are different, your  goals are different but in all of you there is the same mind,  the same feeling and that feeling is Indianness. Wherever Overseas Indians have settled down they considered that place as their work place, and the land from where they migrated as their land of love. With all the success and achievements earned at your workplace, you have come to your motherland, the land that always inspired you and your ancestors. Wherever Overseas Indians have settled down they developed that place but at the same time  they also maintained a unique relation with the place they belonged to and made every possible contribution for its development.

Friends, for my government and for me personally, engagement with the Overseas Indian community has been a key area of priority.  I have met and spoken to hundreds of thousands of our brothers and sisters during my travels abroad  to the US, the UK, Australia, South Africa, UAE, Qatar, Singapore, Fiji, China, Japan, South Korea, Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Malaysia.

As a result of our sustained and systematic outreach, there is new energy, keen desire and strong drive among the Indian Diaspora to connect more extensively and deeply with India’s social and economic transformation.

The remittance of close to sixty nine billion dollars annually by the Overseas Indians makes an invaluable contribution to the Indian economy.

Overseas Indians have the indomitable spirit for the development of this country. They are partners in the progress of the country, they are our co-travelers. You are a valuable colleague, a valuable partner, a stakeholder, in our developmental journey. There was a time when the issue of brain-drain was discussed. Everyone used to ask about brain drain. And I used to tell them; at that time I was neither the chief minister nor Prime Minister, when people used to say that braindrain is happening. Then I used to ask whether the people with only low IQ would stay back in India? But, today I’d like to say with a lot of confidence that we, who, used to talk about brain drain that the initiatives taken by the present government will turn that brain drain into brain gain. We want to turn brain drain into brain-gain and this will become possible due to the cooperation of all of you. It is going to happen in any case and I am sure of this.

NRIs’ and PIOs’ have made outstanding contributions to their chosen fields. Among them, there are politicians of stature, scientists of repute, outstanding doctors, brilliant educationists, economists, musicians, famous philanthropists, journalists, bankers, engineers and lawyers. And, sorry! Did I mention our well known Information Technology professionals? Tomorrow, 30 overseas Indians will receive from the President, the prestigious Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards, which recognize the contributions made by them in various fields, both in India and abroad.

Friends, irrespective of their background and profession, the welfare and safety of all Indians abroad is our top priority. For this, we are strengthening the entire eco-system of our administrative arrangements. Whether it is on loss of their passports; need for legal advice, medical assistance, shelter or even transportation of mortal remains to India. I have directed all Indian embassies to be proactive to address problems of Indian nationals abroad.

Our response to the needs of the Indian nationals overseas is defined by accessibility, sensitivity, speed and promptness. 24x7, help-lines by Indian Embassies; ‘Open House’ meetings with Indian nationals; consular camps; Twitter Seva for passport services; and use of social media platforms for immediate access  are some of the measures that we have put in place  to convey a clear message  that we are there for you when you need us.

The security of Indian nationals abroad is of utmost importance to us. For us,  the color of the passport does not matter, what matters is the blood relations. In institutions of distress faced by Indian nationals, we have reached out to ensure their safety, rescue and repatriation. Our External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj ji, has particularly been proactive and prompt in reaching out to distressed Indians abroad using social media.

Under the operation ‘Sankat Mochan’ in July 2016, we evacuated over one hundred and fifty Indian nationals from South Sudan within 48 hours.  Prior to that, we evacuated several thousands of our citizens from conflict situations in Yemen in well-coordinated, smooth and swift operations. And in the last two years,  2014 to 2016, we facilitated the repatriation of over ninety thousand Indian nationals from nearly 54 countries. Through the Indian Community Welfare Fund we have assisted more than eighty thousand Indian nationals abroad who were in contingency situations.

Our aim is that for every Indian abroad, home should never be far away. When we were kids, we used to hear, how far is maternal uncle’s home ? They used to say,  it is as far as the lamp is. How far is India ? He  should feel, it is far as that lamp is, he should feel this kind of closeness. He may have settled in any country but he should feel this kind of affinity. For those workers who seek economic opportunities abroad, our effort is to provide maximum facilitation and ensure least inconvenience. Our motto is: Go with safety, go with training and skill and go with confidence. For this, we have streamlined our systems and taken several measures to safeguard emigration of Indian workers. About six lakh engineers emigrants have been granted Emigration Clearance online for overseas employment through registered recruitment agents.  Online registration of foreign employers on e-Migrate portal has been made mandatory.

And, the grievances, complaints and petitions of the migrant workers continue to be addressed online through e-Migrate and “MADAD” platforms. We are also taking strict action against illegal recruitment agents in India. Prosecution sanctions by CBI or State Police against illegal agents; and increase in the amount of Bank Guarantee deposited by the recruiting agents from Rs. 20 lakhs to Rs. 50 lakhs are some of the steps in this direction. To ensure that the migrating Indian workers enjoy better economic opportunities, we will shortly launch a skill development program - the “Pravasi Kaushal Vikas Yojana” targeted at Indian youth who seek overseas employment.

Sometimes, those who are going abroad for the first time are not much educated; if we conduct a short duration course for them here for their development as per the requirement of that country. Suppose he is going to some country to work in the house keeping sector and if he is trained here he will go there with a lot of confidence. And that is why we are working on this scheme, Pravasi Kaushal Vikas Yojana for value addition to the people going out of India so that they have self confidence in them. I think, the poor people those who are going abroad for petty work, will get a lot of  benefit from this scheme. It’s essential for the people to learn some sentences, manners and cultural matters of the other country. Even if they are highly educated these things will help them, we are placing emphasis on those things as well that are called soft skills. We are developing those systems because of which when an Indian goes abroad he should not feel an outsider there; he should appear to the natives of that country as someone of their own; his confidence should be so high as if he knew that country for years as if he knew those people so that he can soon set himself there.

Friends. We have a special bond with the Indian Diaspora which is living in the Girmitiya countries, who are deeply and emotionally attached with their place of origin. We are aware of difficulties faced by Persons of Indian Origin from these countries in obtaining an OCI Card if they had moved abroad four or five generations ago. We acknowledge their concerns and have made efforts to address these issues.

I am glad to announce that starting with Mauritius, we are working to put in place new procedures and documentation requirements so that the descendants of Girmitiyas from this country could become eligible for OCI Cards. We remain committed to addressing similar difficulties of PIOs in Fiji, Reunion Islands, Suriname, Guyana and other Caribbean States.

Like my request at the last Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, I would again encourage all PIO Card holders to convert their PIO Cards to OCI Cards. I keep talking about this, keep requesting about this but I know that you people are very busy and due to your preoccupations this thing gets postponed. In view of  your busy schedule I am happy to announce  that we have extended the deadline for such conversion  from 31 December 2016 until June 30, 2017 without any penalty. From the 1st of January this year, beginning with airports in Delhi and Bengaluru, we have also set up special counters at immigration points in our airports for OCI Card holders.

Friends, Today, there are about 7 Lakh Indian students pursuing academic programs abroad. And I’m fully aware that every overseas Indian, every Indian settled abroad is eager to associate himself/herself with the progress of this country.  The meeting  of their knowledge, their science with those of India will take India to the new heights of development.

It has always been my belief and my endeavor that capable and successful Overseas Indians must get full opportunity to associate themselves with the developmental journey of India, particularly in the field of science and  technology.

We have taken several steps in this direction. One of them is that the Department of Science and Technology is launching Visiting Adjunct Joint Research Faculty or VAJRA scheme which enables NRIs and overseas scientific community to participate and contribute to research and development in India. Under the scheme an overseas Indian can work for one to three months in an institution in India. And, that too, at good terms and the most important things is that overseas Indians can become an important part of India’s progress through this.

Friends, it is my firm belief that connect between India and Overseas Indians should be sustained and enriching for both. To meet this goal, in October last year, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, I had the honour of inaugurating the Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra in New Delhi. This Kendra is dedicated to the Overseas Indian community. We want it to become a symbol of the global migration, experiences, struggles, achievements and aspirations of the Indian Diaspora. I am confident that the Kendra will become another important platform for crystallizing ongoing efforts of the government to redefine its engagement with the Overseas Indian community.

Friends, Overseas Indians have settled abroad for several generations and the experience of every generation has strengthened India. Young overseas Indians are special and invaluable to us. Like we develop a special liking for a new plant,  we also want to develop a very close, deep and strong relationship with young overseas Indians.

To provide the young Indian origin youth with an opportunity to visit their motherland and reconnect with their Indian roots, culture, and heritage we have expanded the Government’s Know India Program, under which for the first time, six groups of young Overseas Indians are visiting India this year.

I am very happy to know that 160 of these young Overseas Indians are here today to participate in the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. A special welcome to the young Pravasis– I hope that on returning to your respective countries, you will remain connected with us  wherever you are and visit again, again and again India. Last year, the first edition of the online quiz competition for young Overseas Indians called “Bharat ko Jaano” saw participation of more than 5000 young NRIs and PIOs.  In the second edition this year, I hope to see the participation of at least fifty thousand young overseas Indians.

Young Friends, will you please help me in this mission? Will you please help me in this mission? Are you ready to work with me? Then why we can stop at 50 thousands?

Friends, today India is moving ahead in a new direction. This is not just a progress in the economy but also covers social, political progress and progress in governance. In the economic sector  the FDI norms have been fully liberalized for PIOs and NRIs. And I have two definitions for FDI, one definition is FDI means Foreign Direct Investment and second is First Develop India. Investments by PIOs on non-repatriation basis and by companies, trusts and partnerships owned by them are now deemed to be domestic investment at par with investments made by resident Indians. We have several such programs like Swachch Bharat Mission, Digital India and Start up India through which Overseas Indians can directly connect with the progress of ordinary Indians. There are some amongst you who like to contribute in businesses and investments. Others may feel more comfortable supporting through contributions made to Swachh Bharat, Namami Gange and others.

Still some others may feel motivated to spare their valuable time and efforts in volunteering in India helping the under-privileged or contributing to capacity building programs in various sectors.

We welcome all your efforts that seek to strengthen India’s partnership with the Overseas Indian community. I also invite you to visit the exhibition in the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention (PBD Convention) which gives you a glimpse of some of the flagship programs that we have been implementing and see how you can partner with us.

Friends, you must have seen after coming here that we have launched a massive program against corruption, against black money. Black money and corruption were gradually making our politics, our country, our governance weaker. And it is unfortunate that some political worshippers of black money are trying to portray our efforts as anti-people. I respect, I appreciate and I thank Overseas Indians for supporting the government’s  policies to root out corruption and black money.

Friends, finally, I would like to say that as Indians, we have a common heritage that brings us all together and no matter where we may be around the globe, it is in that common bond that we are strong. And therefore, my dear countrymen the dreams that you nurtured, those dreams are goals for us and all of us should collectively work to realize them  and if it is required to bring changes in the system, to amend the laws, to take bold steps we will do whatever is required to take everyone along.  And while doing whatever is required, while doing all these things I say this thing with confidence that the 21st  century belongs to India.

Thank you very much.

Thank You and Jai Hind.

                Your Excellency, Prime Minister Antonio Costa, 
Distinguished delegates, 
Members of the media, 
Friends, 
Good Evening, to you all.
Excellency,

It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you and your delegation to India.This may be your first State Visit to India, but you are neither a stranger to India, nor is India unfamiliar to you.So, in addition to extending a warm welcome on this chilly evening, I must also say, Welcome Back! We are deeply honoured that you have accepted our invitation to be the Chief Guest at our Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, the Indian Diaspora Day celebrations, in Bengaluru. Tomorrow, we will have the privilege to celebrate your outstanding accomplishments as a distinguished leader who has family roots in India. I also wish to congratulate you for the several successes that Portugal has had under your Prime Ministership. Under your leadership, the Portuguese economy is on a steady course and right direction. 

Friends,

India and Portugal have built a modern bilateral partnership on the foundation of a shared historical connect.Our partnership is also strengthened by a strong convergence on global issues, including at the United Nations. In my extensive discussions with Prime Minister Costa today, we reviewed the full range of India–Portugal ties across various sectors. We agreed that the two countries must focus on action oriented approach to realize the full potential of economic opportunities in our partnership. The agreements signed today are just one indication of our shared resolve to do exactly that. 

Friends, 

Expansion and deepening of trade, investment, and business partnerships between our two countries is our shared priority. Areas of infrastructure, waste and water management, solar and wind energy, and innovation are full of opportunities to build strong commercial ties between our two economies.Our experiences of creating an ecosystem for start-ups could be an exciting area of bilateral engagement. It offers unique possibilities for building a rewarding partnership between our young business entrepreneurs that creates both value and wealth for both our societies.I am confident that the partnership being forged between Start-up Portugal and Start-up India will help us in our mutual quest to innovate and progress. Prime Minister Costa and I also agreed to deepen our partnership in the field of security and defence.The MoU on Defence cooperation signed today will help us harness our respective strengths in this field for mutual benefit.Sports is another area that holds promise for our bilateral ties. We are aware, Excellency, that you are an avid soccer fan. Portugal's strength in football and the rapid development of this sport in India could well form the nucleus of an emerging partnership in sporting disciplines.

Friends, 

India and Portugal share common views on many international issues. I thanked Prime Minister Costa for Portugal’s consistent support for India’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council. We are also grateful for the support extended by Portugal to India’s membership of the Missile Technology Control Regime, and for its continued support for India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. We also discussed the need for the global community to take strong and urgent action against the rapidly growing and widely spreading threats of violence and terror. 

Excellency, 

India and Portugal share a common cultural canvas.We deeply appreciate the contribution of your father, Orlando Costa, to enriching this space and to Goan and Indo-Portuguese literature. Today, we have released a commemorative stamp celebrating two dance forms. These two art forms, one Portuguese and the other Indian, are wonderful examples of our cultural affinities.

Excellency, 

You have an exciting agenda of engagements and travels in India over the next couple of days.I wish you and your delegation the very best for stay and experience in Bengaluru, Gujarat and Goa.I especially wish that you have a memorable visit to Goa and are able to reconnect with your ancestral roots. 


Thank You. 
Thank You very much.

                श्री पटना साहिब, गुरू दी नगरी विखे दशमेश पिता साहिब श्री गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज दे जन्‍म दिहाड़े ते गुरू साहिबान दी बख्‍शीश लेन आई साध-संगत, तुहाणु मैं जी आईयां आखदां हां। इस पवित्र दिहाड़े ते मैं तुहाणु सारियां नू नवे साल दी लख-लख बधाईयां भी दिंदा हां।

आज हम पटना साहिब की इस पवित्र धरती पर इस प्रकाश-पर्व को मनाने में भाग्‍यशाली हुए हैं। लेकिन आज पूरे विश्‍व में जहां-जहां भारतीय रहते हैं, सिख समुदाय रहता है, दुनिया के सभी देशों में भारत सरकार ने हमारी एम्‍बेसीज के माध्‍यम से इस प्रकाश-पर्व मनाने के लिए योजना बनाई है ताकि न सिर्फ हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में लेकिन पूरे विश्‍व को इस बात का अहसास हो कि गुरू गोविंद सिंह महाराज साढ़े तीन सौ साल (350) पूर्व एक ऐसा दिव्‍यात्‍मा का जन्‍म हुआ, जिसने मानवता को कितनी बड़ी प्रेरणा दी। ये विश्‍व को भी परिचय हो उस दिशा में भारत सरकार ने भरपूर प्रयास किया है।

मैं श्रीमान नीतीश जी को, सरकार को, उनके सभी सा‍थियों को और बिहार की जनता को विशेष रूप से अभिनंदन देता हूं क्‍योंकि पटना साहिब में ये प्रकाश-पर्व एक विशेष अहमियत रखता है। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की एकता, अखंडता, भाईचारा, सामाजिक समरसता, सर्वपंत समभाव इसका बहुत ही मजबूत संदेश देने की ताकत ये पटना साहिब में प्रकाश-पर्व को मनाने में है और इसलिए नीतीश जी ने जिस मेहनत के साथ स्‍वयं, मुझे बताया जाता था, कि स्‍वयं गांधी मैदान आ करके, हर चीज की बारीकी से चिंता करके इतने बड़े भव्‍य समारोह की योजना की है।

कार्यक्रम का स्‍थल भले पटना साहिब में हो, लेकिन प्रेरणा पूरे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान को है; प्रेरणा पूरे विश्‍व को है। और इसलिए ये प्रकाश-पर्व हमें भी मानवता के लिए किस रास्‍ते पर चलना है, हमारे संस्‍कार क्‍या हैं, हमारे मूल्‍य क्‍या हैं, हम मानव जाति को क्‍या दे सकते हैं, इसके लिए एक पुन: स्‍मरण करके नए उमंग, उत्‍साह और ऊर्जा के साथ आगे बढ़ने का यह अवसर है।

गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज एक त्‍याग की प्रतिमूर्ति थे। हम कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं कि आंखों के सामने अपने पूज्‍य पिता का बलिदान देखें और अपनी ही मौजूदगी में अपनी संतानों को भी आदर्शों के लिए, मूल्‍यों के लिए, मानवता के लिए बलि चढ़ते देखें, और उसके बाद भी त्‍याग की पराकाष्‍ठा देखें; गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज भी इस गुरू परम्‍परा को आगे बढ़ा सकते थे, लेकिन इनकी दीर्घ-दृष्टि थी कि उन्‍होंने ज्ञान को केंद्र में रखते हुए गुरू ग्रंथ साहिब के हर शब्‍द को जीवन-मंत्र मानते हुए हम सबके लिए आखिर में यही कहा; अब गुरू ग्रंथ साहिब ही, उसका हर शब्‍द, उसका हर पन्‍ना आने वाले युगों तक हमें प्रेरणा देता रहेगा। ये भी, ये भी उनके त्‍याग की मिसाल का अंश था; उससे भी आगे जब पंच प्‍यारे और खालसा पंथ की रचना, उसमें भी पूरे भारत को जोड़ने का उनका प्रयास था।

जब लोग आदि शंकराचार्य की चर्चा करते हैं तो कहते हैं कि आदि शंकर ने हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के चारों कोनों में मठ का निर्माण करके भारत की एकता को बल देने का प्रयास किया था। गुरू गोविंद सिंह महाराज साहब ने भी हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के अलग-अलग कोने से उन पंच-प्‍यारे की पसंद करके समग्र हिन्‍दुस्‍तान को खालसा परम्‍परा के द्वारा एकता के सूत्र में बांधने का उस जमाने में अद्भुत प्रयास किया था, जो आज भी हमारी विरासत है। और मैं हमेशा हृदय से अनुभव करता हूं कि मेरा कुछ खून का रिश्‍ता है क्‍योंकि जो पहले पंच-प्‍यारे थे उन पंच-प्‍यारों को उनको ये नहीं कहा गया था आपको ये मिलेगा, आपको ये पद मिलेगा, आप आगे आइए। नहीं, गुरू गोविंद सिंह महाराज साहिब का कसौटी का मानदंड भी बड़ा ऊंचा रहता था। उन्‍होंने तो सर कटवाने के लिए निमंत्रण दिया था; आइए, आपका सर काट दिया जाएगा और इस त्‍याग के आधार पर तय होगा आगे कैसे बढ़ना है। और अपना सर देने के लिए देश के अलग-अलग कोने से लोग आगे आए, उसमें एक गुजरात के द्वारिका का दर्जी समाज का बेटा, वो भी आगे आया और पंच-प्‍यारों में उसने जगह पाई। गुरू गोविंद सिंह महाराज साहब ने उसको गले लगाया और पंच-प्‍यारे खालसा परम्‍परा निर्माण तो किया था गुरू गोविंद सिंह महाराज साहब ने, वे चाहते उस दिशा में ये परम्‍परा चल सकती थी, लेकिन ये उनका त्‍याग, उनकी ऊंचाई थी कि गुरू गोविंद सिंह महाराज साहब ने स्‍वयं को भी उस बंधनों में बांध दिया, और उन्‍होंने कहा कि ये जो पंच-प्‍यारे हैं, ये जो खालसा परम्‍परा बनी है; मेरे लिए भी क्‍या करना, न करना; कब करना, कैसे करना; ये जो निर्णय करेंगे मैं उसका पालन करूंगा।

मैं समझता हूं कि गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज साहब का इससे बड़ा त्‍याग की कल्‍पना कोई कर नहीं सकता कि जिस व्‍यवस्‍था वो खुद को खड़ी की, खुद की प्रेरणा से जो व्‍यवस्‍था खड़ी हुई, लेकिन उस व्‍यवस्‍था को उन्‍होंने अपने सर पर बिठाया और स्‍वयं को उस व्‍यवस्‍था को समर्पित कर दिया और उस महानता का परिणाम है आज साढ़े तीन सौ (350) साल का प्रकाश-पर्व मनाते हैं तब दुनिया के किसी भी कोने में जाएं, सिख परम्‍परा से जुड़ा हुआ कोई भी व्‍यक्ति होगा वो वहां नतमस्‍तक होता है, अपने-आप को समर्पित करता है। गु्रू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज साहब ने जो परम्‍परा रखी थी उस परम्‍परा का पालन करता है।  

तो ऐसी एक महान प्रेरणा गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज को जब याद करते हैं तो कुछ इतिहासकार शौर्य और वीरता के पहलू को ही प्रकट करते हैं। लेकिन उनकी वीरता के साथ उनकी जो धीरता थी, धैर्य था, वो अद्भुत था। वे संघर्ष करते थे लेकिन त्‍याग की पराकाष्‍ठा अभूतपूर्व थी। वे समाज में बुराइयों के खिलाफ लड़ते थे। ऊंच-नीच का भाव, जातिवाद का जहर, उसके खिलाफ भी लड़ाई लड़के समाज को एकता के सूत्र में बांधना, सबको समानता, इसमें कोई ऊंच-नीच का भेद न हो, उसके लिए जीवन-पर्यन्‍त अपनों के बीच भी वो आग्रहपूर्वक बातों को मनावाने में अपना जीवन खपाते रहे थे।

समाज-सुधारक हो, वीरता की प्रेरणा हो, त्‍याग और तपस्‍या की तपोभूमि में अपने आपको तपाने वाला व्‍यक्तित्‍व हो, सब गुण सम्‍पन्‍न, ऐसा गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज साहब का जीवन आने वाली पीढि़यों को प्रेरणा देता रहे। हम भी सर्वपंत समभाव के साथ समाज का हर वर्ग बराबर है, न कोई ऊंच है न कोई नीच है, न कोई अपना है न कोई पराया है; इन महान मंत्रों को ले करके हम भी देश में सब दूर उन आदर्शों को प्रस्‍थापित करेंगे।

देश की एकता मजबूत बनेगी, देश की ताकत बढ़ेगी, देश प्रगति की नई ऊंचाईयों को प्राप्‍त करेगा। हमें वीरता भी चाहिए, हमें धीरता भी चाहिए; हमें शौर्य भी चाहिए, हमें पराक्रम भी चाहिए; हमें त्‍याग और तपस्‍या भी चाहिए। ये संतुलित समाज व्‍यवस्‍था, ये गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज साहब के हर शब्‍द में, जीवन के हर काम में हमें प्रेरणा देने वाली रही है और इसलिए आज इस महान पवित्र आत्‍मा के चरणों में सर झुकाने का सौभाग्‍य मिला है।

आज गुरू गोविंद जी महाराज साहब के उसी स्‍थान पर आ करके गुरू ग्रंथ साहिब को भी नमन करने का सौभाग्‍य मिला है, मुझे विश्‍वास है कि ये हमें प्रेरणा देता रहेगा। यहां नीतीश जी ने एक बहुत महत्‍वपूर्ण बात को स्‍पर्श किया। महात्‍मा गांधी चम्‍पारण सत्‍याग्रह की शताब्‍दी, लेकिन मैं नीतीश जी को हृदय से एक बात के लिए अभिनंदन करता हूं। समाज परिवर्तन का काम बड़ा कठिन होता है, बहुत मुश्किल काम होता है। उसको हाथ लगाने की हिम्‍मत करना भी बड़ा मुश्किल काम होता है। लेकिन उसके बावजूद भी नशा-मुक्ति का जिस प्रकार से उन्‍होंने अभियान चलाया है। आने वाली पीढि़यों को बचाने के लिए उन्‍होंने जो बीड़ा उठाया है, मैं उनकी बहुत-बहुत अभिनंदन करता हूं, बधाई देता हूं।

और मैं भी पूरे बिहार-वासियों से, सभी राजनीतिक दलों से, सभी सामाजिक जीवन में काम करने वालों से यही गुजारिश करूंगा, ये काम सिर्फ सरकार का नहीं है, ये काम सिर्फ नीतीश कुमार का नहीं है, ये काम सिर्फ किसी राजनीतिक दल का नहीं है; ये जन-जन का काम है। उसको सफल बनाएंगे तो बिहार देश की प्रेरणा बन जाएगा। और मुझे विश्‍वास है कि जो बीड़ा नीतीश जी ने उठाया है वो जरूर सफल होंगे और हमारी आने वाली पीढ़ी को बचाने के काम में गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज का ये प्रकाश-पर्व भी उनको आशीर्वाद देगा, उनको एक नई ताकत देगा। और मुझे विश्‍वास है कि बिहार देश की एक बहुत बड़ी अनमोल शक्ति बनेगा, देश को आगे बढ़ाने में बिहार बहुत बड़ा योगदान करेगा। क्‍योंकि ये बिहार की धरती है जिसने गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज साहब से अब तक अनेक महापुरुष हमें दिए हैं। राजेन्‍द्र बाबू की याद करें। चम्‍पारण सत्‍याग्रह, सत्‍याग्रह की कल्‍पना की भूमि है ये है। जयप्रकाश नारायण, कर्पूरी ठाकुर; अनगिनत, अनगिनत नर-रत्‍न इस धरती ने मां भारती की सेवा में दिए हैं। ऐसे भूमि पर गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज वो प्रेरणा हम सबके लिए एक नया आदर्श, नई प्रेरणा, नई शक्ति देती है। इसी एक अवसर को, प्रकाश-पर्व को, ज्ञान के प्रकाश को जीवनभर अपने अंदर ले जाने के संकल्‍प के साथ हम इस प्रकाश-पर्व को मनाएं।

विश्‍वभर में जो भी भारत सरकार के अलग-अलग मिशन्‍स के द्वारा, एम्‍बेसीज के द्वारा ये प्रकाश-पर्व मनाया जा रहा है। मैं विश्‍वभर में फैले हुए गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज साहब का स्‍मरण करनेवाले सभी जनों को अंत:करण पूर्वक बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं, बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। भारत सरकार ने इस प्रकाश-पर्व को बहुत व्‍यापक रूप से हिन्‍दुस्‍तान और हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के बाहर मनाने की योजना बनाई है, समिति बनाई है।

सौ करोड़ रुपया उस काम के‍ लगाया है। रेलवे ने अलग से करीब 40 करोड़ रुपया लगा करके स्‍थाई व्‍यवस्‍थाएं इस प्रकाश-पर्व के नि‍मित्‍त खड़ी की हैं। भारत सरकार के सांस्‍कृतिक विभाग ने भी करीब 40 करोड़ रुपया लगा करके अनेक विद् योजनाओं को साकार करने की दिशा में काम किया है ताकि ये हमेशा-हमेशा आने वाली पीढि़यों को प्रेरणा देने वाला काम बने, उस दिशा में हम काम कर रहे हैं और आगे भी इस काम को आगे बढ़ाते जाएंगे। मैं फिर एक बार इस अवसर पर, इस पवित्र अवसर पर, सहभागी बनने का मुझे सौभाग्‍य मिला, अपने जीवन को धन्‍य मानता हूं।

आप सबसे प्रणाम करते हुए जो बोले सो निहाल, सत् श्री अकाल।

                श्री पटना साहिब, गुरू दी नगरी विखे दशमेश पिता साहिब श्री गुरू गोविंद सिंह जी महाराज दे जन्‍म दिहाड़े ते गुरू साहिबानदी बख्‍शीश लेन आई साध-संगत, तुहाणु मैं जी आईयां आखदां हां। इस पवित्र दिहाड़े ते मैं तुहाणु सारियां नू नवे साल दीलख-लख बधाईयां भी दिंदा हां।

We are fortunate to celebrate the Prakash Parv today on this holy land of Patna Saheb. But, the government of India has made a plan to celebrate the Prakash Parva through our embassies wherever Indians live in the world, wherever Sikhs live so that not only in India but the whole world realizes that 350 years ago there was  a great soul Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj who gave such a great inspiration to the world. The government of India has made every effort to familiarize the world with this.

I convey my special regards to Shri Nitish Ji, to all his colleagues and the people of Bihar because this Prakash Parv celebration in Patna Saheb is specially significant. The celebration of Prakash Parv in Patna Saheb can convey a very strong message of India’s unity and integrity, brotherhood, social harmony, equal respect for  all faiths. I was told that Nitish ji  himself  did a lot of hard work, he visited Gandhi Maidan and planned this grand gsathering after going into minute details.  

Though the venue of the celebration is Patna Saheb it inspires whole of India; inspires the entire world. And therefore, this Prakash Parv is an opportunity to remember what our values are, what our culture is and what way to humanism we should follow and what we can give to mankind. This is an opportunity to remember these things once again and move forward with a new zeal, new enthusiasm and energy.  

Guru Gobind Singh was an embodiment of renunciation. We can imagine that he saw his revered father’s sacrifice in front of him, he saw the sacrifice of his kids for the values, for the ideals, for the humanism and despite that see the height of renunciation; Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj could have continued with this tradition of Gurus, but he had that foresight and by keeping the knowledge in the centre, in the end he left this message for all of us that now Guru Granth Sahib, every single word of Guru Granth Sahib, every single page Guru Granth Sahib, will continue to inspire us for ages. This was also an example of his renunciation; and going beyond the creation of Panch Pyare and Khalsa Panth was an attempt of him to unite India.

When people talk about Adi Shankaracharya they say that by establishing four Muths (temples) in the four corners of India, Adi Shankaracharya tried to strengthen the unity of India. In that period, Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj Saheb also made an unique attempt by selecting five Panch Pyares from the different corners of India to unite the country through Khalsa sect, and that is our heritage even today. I always feel deep down in my heart that I have some spiritual relation with this because it was not told to those Panch Pyares that you will be given this position so please come forward. It’s not like that, his standards for testing were very high. He invited people for sacrificing their lives through beheading; please come forward, you will be beheaded, and on the basis of that sacrifice it will be decided how to move forward. And people from different corners of the country came forward to sacrifice their heads and one of them was the son of a tailor from Dwarka, Gujarat, he also came forward and got a place among the Panch Pyares. Guru Gobind Singh embraced him.  Guru ji  said that: I will follow what to do and what not to do, when to do and how to do decided by these Panch Pyares and this Khalsa tradition that has been created.

I think nobody can imagine of a bigger sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj Saheb that he accepted the control of the system, he dedicated himself to that system which he himself and created, to a system which was created due to his inspiration and it is the result of that greatness that today after 350 years when Prakash Parv is celebrated and you visit any corner of the world and if there is a person associated to Sikkh tradition he bows down there, he submits himself. And he follows the traditions, the tradition that was laid out by Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj Saheb.

When we remember Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj some historians only discuss the aspects related to his valour and bravery. His bravery and his patience were unique. He fought battles but the extreme limit of his renunciation was unprecedented. He used to fight against the social evils. The feeling of one’s superiority and others inferiority, the poison of caste system, uniting the society by fighting against these things, equality for all and there should not be any feeling of superiority or inferiority, he dedicated his entire life in persuading others, including his own people to accept these things.

He was a social reformer, an inspiration for the  brave, a personality who dedicated himself to renunciation and hard work and equipped with all the virtues. May the life of Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj continue to inspire future generations.

We too need dedication and renunciation to strengthen the country’s integrity and take development to new heights.  We need bravery and we need patience too; we need chivalry, we need valor. Every single word of Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj Saheb, every single work of his life inspire us. 

Today, I got the good opportunity to bow down to Guru Granth Saheb by coming to the place of Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj Saheb. Here Nitish Ji has touched upon an extremely important issue. The centenary of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran movement, but I salute Nitish Ji for one more thing. It’s very difficult to reform the society, it’s too difficult. It takes a lot of courage to even initiate this thing but despite that the way he has started the project to de-addict, took upon himself the task of saving the future generations, I salute him, I congratulate him for this thing.

And I appeal to all the people of Bihar, to all the political parties, to all the people working in the field of social service that this endeavor does not belong to the government alone, this does not belong to Nitish Kumar alone, this work does not belong to any single political party but this belongs to everyone. And if we make it successful then Bihar will become inspiration for the country. 

And I am confident that Nitish Ji will succeed in his endeavor and this Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Sigh Maharaj will also bless him, will give him a new strength in his this work of saving the future generations. And I’m confident that Bihar will become an invaluable strength of the country and will make a very big contribution in taking the country forward. Because it is the land of Bihar that has given us several great souls, from Guru Gobind Sigh Maharaj Saheb to till now. We should remember Rajendra Babu. This is the land of Champaran movement, this is the place where civil disobedience was conceived. Jai Prakash Narain, Karpuri Thakur, this land given numerous human jewels in the service of mother India. Guru Gobind Sigh Ji Maharaj on such a land, it gives all of us a new ideal, new inspiration, a new power. We should celebrate this Prakash Parv, this occasion with the determination to internalize this Prakash Prav for the rest of our lives.

This Prakash Parv is being celebrated through the missions of government of India, through the embassies spread throughout the world. I congratulate and convey my best wishes to all those people settled across the globe who remember Guru Gobind Sigh Ji Maharaj Saheb

The Government of India has planned to celebrate this Prakash Parv within and outside India in a very comprehensive manner, it has created a committee for this thing and fund of 100 crore rupees has been spent on this. In addition to this, the railways has created permanent facilities for Prakash Parv by spending 40 crore rupees. The culture department of Government of India has spent nearly forty crore rupees in implementing several schemes so that this occasion becomes a reason for inspiration to future generations, we have been working in that direction and we will continue to take forward this work. Once again I consider myself blessed that I got the good opportunity to participate in this holy occasion.

I convey my regards to all of you, Jo Bole So Nihal, Sat Shri Akal.

Distinguished Delegates
Ladies and Gentlemen.
 
I am delighted to begin the New Year with distinguished scientists from home and abroad in the holy city of Tirupati.
I am happy to inaugurate this 104th session of The Indian Science Congress in the panoramic campus of Sri Venkateswara University.
And I appreciate the Indian Science Congress Association for choosing an appropriate theme “Science & Technology for National Development” for this year’s session. 
 
Distinguished Delegates,
 
The nation will always be grateful to the scientists who have worked tirelessly to empower our society by their vision,  labour, and leadership. 
In November 2016, the country lost one such eminent scientist and institution builder, Dr. M.G.K. Menon. I join you in paying tribute to him. 
 
Distinguished Delegates,
 
The speed and scale of changes we encounter today are unprecedented.
How are we going to respond to these challenges that we do not even know could arise? It is a deep-rooted curiosity-driven scientific tradition which allows quick adaptation to new realities. 
Tomorrow’s experts will come from investments we make today in our people and infrastructure. My government is committed to supporting different streams of scientific knowledge; ranging from fundamental science to applied science with emphasis on innovations.
 
Distinguished Delegates. 
In the last two sessions of the science congress, I presented before you several key challenges and opportunities for the nation. 
 
Some of these important challenges are in the key sectors of clean water & energy, food, environment, climate, security, and healthcare.  
We equally need to keep an eye on the rise of disruptive technologies and be prepared to leverage them for growth. We need to clearly assess the challenges and opportunities for our technology readiness and competitiveness. 
I have been told that the Technology Vision 2035 document released in last year’s Science Congress, is now developing into a detailed roadmap for twelve key technology sectors. Further, NITI Aayog is evolving a holistic science and technology vision for the country.
One important area that needs to be addressed is the rapid global rise of Cyber-Physical Systems. This has the potential to pose unprecedented challenges and stresses to our demographic dividend. But we can turn it into a huge opportunity by research, training and skilling in robotics, artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, big data analysis, deep learning, quantum communication and Internet-of-Things.
There is a need to develop and exploit these technologies in services and manufacturing sectors; in agriculture, water, energy & traffic management; health, environment, infrastructure and Geo Information Systems; security; financial systems and in combating crime. 
We need to develop an Inter-Ministerial National Mission in the Cyber-Physical Systems to secure our future by creation of basic R&D infrastructure, manpower and skills.
 
Distinguished Delegates.
 
The oceans that surround the Indian peninsula have over thirteen hundred of our islands. They also give us a seven and a half thousand kilometre coastline and 2.4 million square kilometres of Exclusive Economic Zone.  
They contain enormous opportunities in energy, food, medicine and a host of other natural resources. The ocean economy should be a significant dimension of our sustainable future. 
I am told, that the Ministry of Earth Sciences is working to launch a Deep Ocean Mission to explore, understand and harness this resource in a responsible way.  This could be a transformative step for the prosperity and security of the nation.
 
Distinguished Delegates, 
Our best science and technology institutions should further strengthen their basic research in line with leading global standards. Translating this basic knowledge into innovations, start-ups and industry will help us achieve inclusive and sustainable growth. 
SCOPUS database indicates that India now ranks sixth in the world with respect to scientific publications, growing at a rate of about fourteen percent  as against the world average growth rate of about four percent. I am sure that our scientists will further meet the challenges of enhanced quality of basic research, its technology translation and its societal connect. 
By 2030 India will be among the top three countries in science and technology and will be among the most attractive destinations for the best talent in the world. The wheels we set in motion today will achieve this goal.
 
Distinguished Delegates,
Science must meet the rising aspirations of our people. India fully appreciates the strong role science and technology plays in meeting the societal needs. We must address the problems of urban-rural divide and work for inclusive development, economic growth and employment generation. To enable this, there is a need for a new overarching structure that will coordinate with all the relevant stakeholders. 
 
Our ability to mount and execute large, transformational national missions requires effective partnerships that integrate with a large stakeholder base.  The effectiveness of these missions can be ensured only by getting out of our deep rooted silos, and adopting a collaborative approach, which is essential to address our multifarious development challenges rapidly and effectively. Our ministries, our scientists, R&D institutions, industries, start-ups, universities and IITs, all should work together seamlessly. In particular, our infrastructure and socio-economic ministries must make appropriate use of science and technology. 
Our Institutions could consider inviting outstanding scientists from abroad including NRIs for long term research associations. We should involve foreign and NRI PhD students in post-doctoral research in our projects. 
Another empowering factor for scientific delivery is the Ease of Doing Science. If we want science to deliver, we must not constrain it. 
Building a strong Science and Technology infrastructure that is accessible to academia, start-ups, industry and R&D labs is a priority of the government. We need to address the problems of ease of access, maintenance, redundancy and duplication of expensive equipments in our Scientific Institutions. The desirability of establishing professionally managed, large regional centers in PPP mode housing high value scientific equipment should be examined.
On the lines of Corporate Social Responsibility, the concept of Scientific Social Responsibility needs to be inculcated to connect our leading institutions to all stakeholders, including schools and colleges. We must create an environment for sharing of ideas and resources. 
The brightest and best in every corner of India should have the opportunity to excel in science. This will ensure that our youth get high-end training exposure to the best of science and technology to make them job-ready in a competitive world. 
To this end, I would exhort the National Laboratories to connect with schools and colleges to develop appropriate training programs. This will also help with the effective use and maintenance of our vast scientific and technological infrastructure.
Laboratories, Research Institutions and Universities in each major city region, should be interlinked to function on a hub and spoke model. The hubs will share major infrastructure, drive our national science missions and be the engines that link discovery to application. 
 
College teachers with background in research can be connected to the neighbouring universities and R&D institutions. Outreach activities from the institutions of eminence to schools, colleges and polytechnics will activate the latent Science and Technology manpower from the educational institutions in your neighbourhoods.  
 
Distinguished delegates,
Seeding the power of ideas and innovation in schoolchildren will broaden the base of our innovation pyramid and secure the future of our nation. As a step in this direction, Ministry of Science & Technology is initiating a programme focused on students of classes 6 to 10.
 
The programme will scout, mentor, reward and showcase ten lakh top innovative ideas focused on local needs from 5 lakh schools.   
We must provide equal opportunities to the girl child to enroll and excel in the under-represented disciplines of science and engineering and ensure continued participation of trained women scientists in nation building.
 
Distinguished Delegates,
For a large and diverse country like India, technology needs to span a wide range; from advanced space, nuclear and defence technologies to rural development needs in providing clean water, sanitation, renewable energy, community health, etc. 
While we excel globally, we also need to develop local solutions that fit our unique context. 
There is a need to develop appropriate Micro-Industry models for the rural areas that use local resources and skills to meet the local needs and generate local enterprise and employment. 
For example, we should develop a host of technologies based on efficient co-generation for clusters of villages and semi-urban areas. These technologies should aim to convert agri and bio-waste to satisfy multiple needs of electricity, clean water, crop-processing and cold storage.
 
Distinguished Delegates,
 
The role of science in planning, decision making, and governance has never been more important. 
 
We need to develop and deploy Geo-information Systems to meet the development goals of our citizens, Gram Panchayats, Districts and States. A coordinated effort by the Survey of India, ISRO and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology can be transformative.  
For sustainable development, we must take strong measures to focus on Waste to Wealth Management in the critical areas of electronic waste, biomedical and plastic wastes, and solid waste and waste water solutions.
We are scaling up R&D on clean carbon technologies, technologies for enhancement of energy efficiency and increased and efficient use of renewable energy.  
Focus on environment and climate remains our priority to ensure sustainable development. Our strong scientific community can also effectively address our unique challenges. For example, can we find farmer-centric solutions to the problem of crop burning? Can we redesign our brick kilns for reduced emissions and greater energy efficiency?
Science and technology is a key factor in the Startup India Programme launched in January 2016. Two other strong initiatives are Atal Innovation Mission and NIDHI - the National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations. These programmes focus on building an innovation driven enterprise ecosystem. Further, Public-Private partnerships with CII, FICCI and high technology private companies are being pursued to strengthen the innovation ecosystem. 
 
Distinguished Delegates,
Our Scientists have contributed strongly to the strategic vision of the nation.
 
The Indian space programme has put India among the top space faring nations. We have achieved a high degree of self-sufficiency in space technology, including launch vehicle development, payload and satellite building, applications for development and the building of core competence and capacity.  
 
The Defence Research & Development Organisation has played the role of a force multiplier for the Armed Forces with its systems and technologies.  
We are leveraging strategic international partnerships and collaborations based on the principles of mutuality, parity and reciprocity, to make Indian Science globally competitive. We are also placing special emphasis on building strong relationships with our neighbouring countries and multilateral fora such as BRICS. The best of global science is helping us unravel creation’s mysteries and develop cutting-edge technologies. Last year, we activated the 3.6 meter optical telescope in Devasthal in Uttarakhand made with Indo-Belgian collaboration. Recently, we approved the LIGO project with USA to construct a state-of-the-art detector system in India. 
 
Distinguished Delegates,
In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the Government remains committed to provide the best support to our Scientists and Scientific Institutions. 
I am sure that our scientists will scale up their efforts ranging from the quality of basic sciences to technology development to innovation.
Let Science and Technology become a strong tool of inclusive development and betterment of the weakest and poorest segments of our society.
Together, we will prevail to make a just, equitable and prosperous nation.
Jai Hind.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its post-facto approval for the following decisions: 
 
                     i.        National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD) will make short term borrowings at prevailing market rate of interest for approx. Rs.20,000 crore for on-lending to Cooperative Banks at 4.5% rate of interest. 
                    ii.        Additional capital of Rs.2,000 crore to be provided to NABARD for this purpose through the Union Budget. To start with, additional capital of Rs.500 crore may be released to NABARD during 2016-17 itself. 
                   iii.        Interest Subvention of about 1.8% and NABARD's administrative cost of 0.2% to be provided as per the scheme of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW). The extent of interest subvention may vary depending on the rate at which NABARD raises funds. 
                  iv.        NABARD will coordinate the conversion of operative/live KCCs into RuPay/ATM-enabled Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) by Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in a mission mode. 
 
In the light of good monsoon and expectation of increased credit demand and in order to boost agricultural production, the farmers need to be supported through Cooperative Banks, which purvey credit at their doorstep, to enable them to scale up their agricultural operation. 
 
The approval will ensure increased availability of short term crop loans to farmers through Cooperative banks at reduced rate of interest. The conversion of operative/live KCCs into RuPay/ATM-enabled KCCs will enable easy and hassle free availability of credit and in keeping with the spirit of 'Digital' India, will facilitate digital and cashless transactions by farmers.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its post-facto approval for launching of Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana 2017 (VPBY 2017).  It is a part of Government’s commitment for financial inclusion and social security. 
 
The scheme will be implemented through Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) during the current financial year to  provide social security during old age and protect elderly persons aged 60 years and above against a future fall in their interest income due to uncertain market conditions. The scheme will provide an assured pension based on a guaranteed rate of return of 8% per annum for ten years, with an option to opt for pension on a monthly / quarterly / halfyearly and annual basis. The differential return, i.e., the difference between the return generated by LIC and the assured return of 8% per annum would be borne by Government of India as subsidy on an annual basis. 
 
VPBY-2017 is proposed to be open for subscription for a period of one year from the date of launch.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has given its approval to ratify the Second Commitment Period of the  Kyoto Protocol on containing the emission of Green House Gases (GHGs).  The second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 2012.   So far, 75 countries have ratified the Second Commitment Period.
In view of the critical role played by India in securing  international consensus on climate change issues, this decision further  underlines India's leadership in the comity of nations committed to  global cause of environmental protection and climate justice.  Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by India will encourage other  developing countries also to undertake this exercise. Implementation of  Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects under this commitment period  in accordance with Suslainable Development priorities will attract some  investments in India as well.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)  seeks to stabilise Green House Gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a  level that would minimize interference with the climate system.  Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the  current high levels of Greenhouse Gas (GHGs) in the atmosphere, the  Kyoto Protocol places commitments on developed nations to undertake  mitigation targets and to provide financial resources and transfer of  technology to the developing nations. Developing countries like India  have no mandatory mitigation obligations or targets under the Kyoto  Protocol.
Background
The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 and the 1st commitment period  was from 2008-2012. At Doha in 2012, the amendments to Kyoto Protocol  for the 2nd commitment period (the Doha Amendment) were successfully  adopted for the period 2013- 2020. Developed countries have already  started implementing their commitments under the 'opt-in' provisions of  the Doha Amendment.
India has always emphasized the importance of climate actions by  developed country Parties in the pre-2020 period.  Besides, it has  advocated climate actions based on the principles and provisions of the  Convention, such as the principle of Equity and Common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR &  RC).

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has given its approval to transfer 11.35 acres of land to Airports  Authority of India (AAI) by way of exchanging equivalent land of AAI at  Anisabad. The proposed land at Patna Airport will be used for expansion  of the airport and construction of new terminal building along-with  other associated infrastructures. The State Government has also agreed  in principle for transfer of the land.
The new terminal building will be having a capacity of 3 million  passengers per annum which will not only enhance the airport capacity  but also provide convenience to general public.
Background:
The existing terminal building at Patna Airport was built for a  capacity of 0.5 million passengers per annum, against which 1.5 million  passengers per annum are already using the airport. This has led to  extreme crowding in the terminal building.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has given its ex-post facto approval for interest waiver for the two  months of November and December, 2016 for farmers accessing short term  crop loans from Cooperative Banks.  The decision also provides for  interest subvention to National Bank for Agricultural and Rural  Development (NABARD) on additional refinance by NABARD to Cooperative  Banks.
Farmers in the whole of India availing short term crop loans, from Cooperative Banks will be benefitted.
The decision intends to ensure availability of resources with  Cooperative Banks help farmers in easily accessing crop loans from  Cooperative Banks to overcome the difficulties in view of the reduction  in availability of cash for carrying out Rabi operations.
Additional resources are to be provided to Cooperative Banks through  NABARD for refinance to the Cooperative Banks on account of interest  waiver of two months for November and December, 2016.   This will be  extended by Cooperative Banks to the farmers in the current financial  year 2016-17.  An additional financial liability of Rs. 1060.50 crore  will be required for this purpose.      A sum of Rs. 15, 000 crore  allocated during 2016-17 to implement the Interest Subvention Scheme  (ISS) has already been utilised.
 Background:
a)	The Government of India has, since 2006-07, been implementing the  Interest Subvention Scheme under which short-term crop loans upto Rs.3  lakh are made available to the farmers at an interest rate of 7 percent  per annum by the Public Sector. Banks, Regional Rural Banks and  Cooperative. Banks.  Farmers are provided with 3% interest subvention  for short term crop loan upto Rs. 3 lakhs on prompt repayment of the  loan. Thus, farmers have to effectively pay only 4% as interest for the  said crop loan.
b)	Due to the cancellation of legal tender character of old Rs. 500  and Rs.1000 notes and the resulting difficulty faced by the farmers in  en-cashing the cheques received against sale proceeds of their Kharif  produce in the mandis; and also their constraints with adequacy of cash  in carrying out Rabi operations and servicing the interest of the short  term crop loans, especially in view of the restrictions imposed on  Cooperative Banks, an interest waiver is being provided for a period of 2  months i.e. November & December 2016 to farmers who were disbursed  crop loan from Cooperative Banks between 01.04.2016 and 30.09.2016.
c)	The provision of additional financial resource of Rs. 1060.50  crore is on account of (i) meeting the cost of interest waiver for 2  months ( November and December, 2016) for crop loan disbursed by  Cooperative Banks between 01.04.2016 and 30. 09.2016 to farmers and (ii)  providing interest subvention and administrative cost  to NABARD on  short term borrowing of about Rs. 20,000 crore for on-lending to  Cooperatives Banks in the current financial year.

      iii.            Management of these Institutions would be Board driven, with the Chairperson and Director of an Institution which will be selected by the Board. 
     iv.            A greater participation of experts and alumni in the Board is amongst otherimportant features of the Bill. 
       v.            Provision has also been made for inclusion of women and members from Scheduled Castes/Tribes in the Board.  
     vi.            The Bill also provides for periodic review of the performance of Institutions by independent agencies, and placing the results of the same on public domain.

Indian Institutes of Management are the country's premier institutions imparting best quality education in management on globally benchmarked processes of education and training in management. IIMs are recognized as world-class management Institutions and Centers of Excellence and have brought laurels to the country. All IIMs are separate autonomous bodies registered under the Societies Act.
Being societies, IIMs are not authorized to award degrees and, hence, they have been awarding Post Graduate Diploma and Fellow Programme in Management. While these awards are treated as equivalent to MBAs and Ph.D, respectively, the equivalence is not universally acceptable, especially for the Fellow Programme.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has approved a new scheme for promotion of Rural Housing in the country.   The Government would provide interest subsidy under the scheme.  Interest subsidy would be available to every rural household who is not  covered under the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana (Grameen), PMAY(G).
The scheme would enable people in rural areas to construct new  houses or add to their existing pucca houses to improve their dwelling  units.  The beneficiary who takes a loan under the scheme would be  provided interest subsidy for loan amount upto Rs. 2 Lakhs.
National Housing Bank would implement the scheme. The Government  would provide net present value of the interest subsidy of 3 percent to  the National Housing Bank upfront which will, in turn, pass it to the  Primary Lending Institutions (Scheduled Commercial Banks, NBFCs etc.).  As a result the equated monthly installment (EMI) for the beneficiary  would be reduced.
Under the scheme, the Government would also take necessary steps for  proper convergence with PMAY-G including technical support to  beneficiary through existing arrangements. The new scheme is expected to  improve housing stock in the rural areas, as well as create employment  opportunities in rural housing sector.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for amendment in the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) to further incentivize investments in Electronic Sector and moving towards the goal of ‘ Net Zero imports’ in electronics by 2020. 
 
Besides expediting investments into the Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector in India, the amendments in M-SIPS are expected to create employment opportunities and reduce dependence on imports. The projects already received under the scheme have the potential to generate employment to the extent of upto one million persons (direct and indirect).
 
The Policy covers all States and Districts and provides them an opportunity to attract investments in electronics manufacturing. So far, 243 applications have been received under the scheme, out of which 75 applications have been approved involving investment proposals of Rs. 17,997 crore.
 
The salient features of the amendment are:
 
a)     The applications will be received under the scheme upto 31st December 2018 or till such time that an incentive commitment of Rs 10,000 crore is reached, whichever is earlier. In case the incentive commitment of Rs 10,000 crore is reached, a review will be held to decide further financial commitments.
 
b)     For new approvals, the incentive under the scheme will be available from the date of approval of a project and not from the date of receipt of application.
 
c)     The incentives will be available for investments made within 5 years from the date of approval of the project.
 
d)     Approvals will normally be accorded to eligible applications within 120 days of submission of the complete application.
 
e)     A unit receiving incentives under the scheme, will provide an undertaking to remain in commercial production for a period of at least 3 years.
 
f)       The Appraisal Committee recommending approval of project will be chaired by Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and IT.
 
g)     A separate Committee headed by Cabinet Secretary and comprising of CEO, NITI Aayog, Secretary Expenditure and Secretary, MeitY will be set up in respect of mega projects, envisaging more than Rs. 6850 crore (approx. USD 1 Billion) investments.
 
Background
 
The Cabinet had, in July, 2012 approved the M-SIPS to provide a special incentive package to promote large scale manufacturing in the Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector. The scheme provides subsidy for capital expenditure - 20% for investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and 25% in non-SEZs.  The   Scheme was amended in August, 2015   for scope enhancement and simplification of procedure. The Scheme has attracted investments in the ESDM sector to the tune of Rs. 1,26,838 crore, of which investments of around Rs. 17,997 crore have been approved by the MeitY. The M-SIPS has been able to create positive impact on investment in electronics sector.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed on November 11, 2016 at Tokyo, Japan between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for cooperation in the field of outer space.
 
The purpose of this MoU is to pursue future cooperative activities in the exploration and use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable in each country and their international obligations. 
 

 

This MoU provides scope for pursuing cooperation in various areas of space science technology and applications including: eearth observation, satellite communication and navigation; exploration and space sciences; Research and development (space systems and space technology); and Space industry promotion. 
 
ISRO and JAXA will bear the costs of their respective activities under this Memorandum, unless they decide otherwise in writing. Ability to fulfil their respective roles and activities under this Memorandum and its relevant separate Implementation Arrangement is subject to their respective funding procedures, the availability of appropriated funds and their respective national laws.
 

 

Framework MoU would lead to joint activity in the field of application of space technologies for the benefit of humanity. Thus all sections and regions of the country will get benefited.
 

 

 

Background:

 
India and Japan pursue space cooperation for more than 5 decades and carried out studies in the field of atmospheric study, observation of universe and scientific investigation in remote sensing. With the formation of JAXA in 2003, an ""arrangement concerning the considerations of potential future cooperation in the field of outer space"" was signed in October 2005 between ISRO/ Department of Space (DOS) and JAXA. Subsequently both agencies have signed cooperative documents addressing lunar exploration, satellite navigation, X-ray astronomy and Asia Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum (APRSAF).
 
During the ISRO-JAXA bilateral meeting held at New Delhi on April 05, 2016, both sides stressed the need for updating the contents of '2005 Arrangement' with enhanced scope of cooperation. Accordingly, both sides have arrived at the draft of new 'Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between ISRO and JAXA concerning cooperation in the field of outer space’ and got it signed on November 11, 2016 at Tokyo during the visit of Prime Minister of India to Japan.

                The  Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has  approved signing and ratifying an Agreement between India and Uruguay  regarding Cooperation and Mutual Assistance in Customs Matters.
 
 The  Agreement will help in the availability of relevant information for the  prevention and investigation of Customs offences. The Agreement is also  expected to facilitate trade and ensure efficient clearance of goods  traded between the countries.

The  draft Agreement takes care of Indian Customs' concerns and  requirements, particularly in the area of exchange of information on the  correctness of the Customs value declared, the authenticity of  certificates of origin of goods and the description of the goods traded  between the two countries.
 Background:
Uruguay  is an important trading partner of India among members of the MERCOSUR,  a trading block in Latin America. India signed a Preferential Trade  Agreement (PTA) with the MERCOSUR which came into effect from 1st  June, 2009. Trade between India and the Uruguay has been expanding  gradually. The Agreement would provide a legal framework for sharing of  information and intelligence between the Customs authorities of the two  countries and help in the proper application of Customs laws, prevention  and investigation of Customs offences and the facilitation of  legitimate trade. The draft text of the proposed Agreement has been  finalized with the concurrence of the two Customs Administrations.

The  Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister  Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal of India Trade Promotion  Organisation (ITPO), a Mini Ratna Category-1 Company under the  Department of Commerce, for redevelopment of Pragati Maidan by setting  up of a world class Integrated Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (IECC)  at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi.
The total cost of the project will be Rs.2,254 crore.  ITPO will  utilise Rs.1,200 crore out of its free reserves towards funding of the  project.  ITPO will raise institutional loan / soft loan / external aid /  land monetization for the balance amount of Rs.1,054 crore with  government guarantee for the amount of institutional loan.
The redevelopment of Pragati Maidan is envisaged in two phases.   Phase-1 redevelopment is expected to complete by May 2019.  Phase-1 of  the project will result in redevelopment of nearly 3.26 lakh sq.mtrs.   After redevelopment, the exhibition space will be doubled to 1.19 lakh  sq.mtr. as against 65,000 sq.mtr. presently.  Redevelopment will also  include creation of a state-of-the-art Convention Center with seating  capacity of 7,000 persons.
For execution of this mega project, ITPO has assigned the work to  National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd. (NBCC) as a Project  Management Consultant.  ITPO would call for global bidding for selection  of project executor(s) for construction of the project.
With India’s growing international profile and increasing presence  at summit, ministerial and other levels, a need has been felt to have a  modern world class Integrated Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre at New  Delhi to provide an appropriate venue for international events.  Present  facilities are far short of international standards.
To ease road congestion, grade separator will be provided at the  junction of Mathura Road and Bhairon Road.  Also, there will be direct  connectivity through subway from Mathura Road to Ring Road across  Pragati Maidan.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ‘in principle’ approval  for listing the following five Government owned General Insurance Companies in the stock exchanges.  These are: 
 
(i)                 The New India Assurance Company Ltd.
(ii)               United India Insurance Company Ltd.,
(iii)             Oriental Insurance Company Ltd.,
(iv)             National Insurance Company Ltd. and
(v)               General Insurance Corporation of India.
 
The shareholding of these Public Sector General Insurance Companies (PSGICs) will be divested from 100 percent to 75  percent in one or more tranches over a period of time.  During the process of disinvestment, existing rules and regulations of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) will be followed.
 
Listing of (PSGICs) is likely to yield the following benefits:
 
a.       Listing on the Stock Exchange necessitates compliance with a number of disclosures and accounting requirements of SEBI, which acts as an additional oversight mechanism.  The disclosures bring about transparency and equity in the companies functioning.
b.      Listing is expected to lead to improved corporate governance and risk management practices leading to improved efficiency.  A greater focus on growth and earnings can also be expected.
c.       Listing will open the way for the companies to raise resources from the capital market to meet their fund requirements to expand their businesses, instead of being dependent on the Government for capital infusion.
 
Background:
 
            The Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for 2016-17 had announced that public shareholding in Government-owned companies is a means of ensuring higher levels of transparency and accountability; and to promote this objective, the general insurance companies owned by the Government will be listed on the stock exchanges.

This is in addition to the present functions performed by  Alternative Mechanism as has been approved by CCEA in August, 2014.
This would reduce speculation and overhang and expedite the disinvestment process.

In order to curtail malpractices in the advertisement of AYUSH drugs, the Ministry of AYUSH has signed a MoU with the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI). Addressing  the cases of misleading advertisements with respect to Ayurveda, Yoga  and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy drugs, treatments and  related services, ASCI will comprehensively monitor these advertisements  across print and electronic media. The MoU was signed by   Advisor (Ayurveda), Ministry of AYUSH Dr, Dinesh Chan Katoch and  Chairman, ASCI Shri Srinivasan K Swamy in the presence of Secretary  AYUSH Shri Ajit M Sharan at New Delhi.
 ASCI  has been given a self-monitoring mandate by the Ministry of AYUSH to  identify potentially misleading advertisement in the AYUSH sector and  process complaints through its Consumer Complaints Council (CCC). The  Ministry of AYUSH will also redirect complaints against misleading  advertisements they receive, to the ASCI, which will be reviewed using  ASCI’s code and guidelines. The MoU also requires ASCI to report to the  Ministry of AYUSH, all advertisements in potential violation of the  Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and  Rules thereunder as well as non-compliance of ASCI’s CCC recommendations  for the Ministry of AYUSH to take further action.
Commenting on the partnership, Secretary,  Ministry of AYUSH Sh. Ajit M. Sharan, said that the MOU is yet another  important step taken by the AYUSH ministry to ensure that Indian  consumers have access to safe and effective medicines. The arrangement  would also ensure that any advertisement making claims for diseases and  disorders, in violation of the existing regulations, are immediately  brought to our attention.
Chairman,  ASCI, Sh. S.K. Swamy, added that AYUSH is among top three sectors where  we find a high incidence of misleading advertisements and some of the  advertisements in the AYUSH sector claiming treatment of certain  diseases in violation of the Drugs and Magic Remedies Regulations have  been a cause of concern. ASCI’s partnership with the Ministry of AYUSH  will provide the necessary support to our efforts in effectively  curtailing misleading advertisements in this sector.

Addressing the inaugural session at the two-day  International Symposium on Medicinal and Aromatic plants of India here  today, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development  of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances  & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that  lifestyle diseases like Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 require holistic  management and with more than 65% to 70% of India’s population today  being less than 40 years of age, Diabetes and heart attack in young are  going to be the main challenges ahead, because these tend to affect the  youth potential which is imperative in the task of nation building.
Dr Jitendra Singh referred to the change of disease  spectrum of India over the last few decades and said that India today  has evolved from an era of communicable diseases into an era of  non-communicable diseases like Diabetes Mellitus, heart attack, lipid  disorders, hypertension and other metabolic diseases. Even though a  number of new remedies and medicinal options are available for the  treatment of these diseases, he said, the basic Mantra is still based on  lifestyle modifications and natural methods, and for this purpose, the  various Indian medicine regimens incorporated in Naturopathy, Yoga and  other indigenous therapies find a contributory role, he added.
Under the leadership of the Prime Minister Shri  Narendra Modi, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the last two years, not only  the holistic medicine and the indigenous therapies have been accorded  priority but have also been given a place of respectability. He said  that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi decided to establish the  first ever independent Ministry of AYUSH in the Government of India  after nearly 70 years of independence. Similarly, it was again Prime  Minister Shri Narendra Modi on whose proposal the United Nations  unanimously accepted to observe International Yoga Day on 21st June, he  added.
India is the fountain- head and original birth-place  of all the aromatic and medicinal plants, said Dr Jitendra Singh and  regretted that in the last few decades, most of the research on the  Indian medicinal plants was conducted in other countries and not in  India. To that extent, he said, the Central Government has tried to  vindicate the lapse of the earlier decades.
While emphasizing on indigenous research based on  Indian conditions, Dr Jitendra Singh also called for change of mindset,  so that those who choose to become practitioners of Indian medicine,  should do so by aptitude and interest.
Dr Jitendra Singh said that the North East region of  India has huge potential for the organic products which have huge  health benefits. This unexplored potential needs to be explored, he  added. He also said that Government is giving priority to tap this  potential of the North East region as well as placing high priority on  the health status of the citizens. This will be helpful in tapping the  natural organic resources for the health benefit of the citizens, he  added.
MoS Agriculture Shri Parshottam Rupala, while  speaking on the occasion said that the Ministry of Agriculture will  evolve a more comprehensive plan to promote medicinal plants and herbs  and will also try to take the experts on board. 
 Member of Parliament, Shri Manoj Tiwari, MLA of  Delhi Shri O. P. Sharma and Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH, Shri Ajit  Sharan were also present on the occasion.

The three day International Conference on “Yoga for Diabetes” was inaugurated by Minister of State for AYUSH (Independent  Charge), Shri Shripad Yesso Naik  in New Delhi today.  In his inaugural address, the Minister informed  that UNESCO, the world’s apex body for culture has recently included yoga in its list of intangible cultural heritage.  This is yet another recognition of the universal relevance of yoga and will add to its respectability across national borders, the Minister added.
 
Shri Naik said  that  this conference aims to generate discussions on the role of Yoga in the prevention and management of Diabetes and to draw up a roadmap to be adopted for the control of Diabetes through Yoga. It will provide a common platform for the Allopathy and AYUSH practitioners, Researchers, Academicians, Policy makers and students to come together in the fight against diabetes.
 
Approximately 400 delegates and 50 experts from India and abroad are expected to participate in the Conference. Eminent experts of conventional medicine, AYUSH systems as well as Yoga are participating in the Conference.  The three days Conference consists of main and parallel sessions on different aspects of Yoga & Diabetes including research, policy making and panel discussion.
Diabetes is spreading at a very fast pace in India, particularly in urban population. It is no more restricted to the older population as younger generation is also becoming prone to this disease.
 
Hon’ble Prime Minister, while addressing the 2nd International day of Yoga celebration at Chandigarh, said the following: 
 
Let's focus on one thing in the coming days, how to mitigate diabetes through yoga. Diabetes can surely be controlled through yoga.
 
Keeping this in view, Ministry of AYUSH has initiated several programmes for creating awareness about the role of Yoga in the prevention and management of Diabetes mellitus. Ministry of AYUSH constituted an Expert Committee to prepare a Common Yoga Protocol for control of Diabetes mellitus under the chairmanship of Dr. H. R. Nagendra. The Committee finalized the same. The said booklet was released by the Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi on 2nd October, 2016 on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas in New Delhi.
 
On this occasion the minister released the  book on Yoga  in which selected research papers from 2001 to 2016 are  compiled. Shri Naik also released 2017 calendar on Yoga and Diabetes.

No. 437/TA-LA/2017/Communication                                             Dated: 11th January, 2017
 
ORDER
 
            At the time of General Elections to the Lok Sabha in 1998, a new initiative for State funding of recognized political parties through free use of the State owned Television and Radio was introduced under directions of the Commission vide its Order, dated 16th January, 1998. The said scheme was subsequently extended in all the General Elections to the State Assemblies held after 1998 and General Elections to the Lok Sabha in 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014.
           
With the amendments to the Representation of People Act, 1951 vide ""Election and Other Related Laws (Amendment) Act, 2003"" and the rules notified thereunder, equitable time sharing for campaigning by recognized political parties on electronic media now has statutory basis. In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (a) of the Explanation below section 39A of the Representation of People Act, 1951, the Central Government has notified all such broadcasting media which are owned or controlled or financed wholly or substantially by funds provided to them by the Central Government as the electronic media for the purposes of that section. Therefore, the Commission has decided to extend the said scheme of equitable time sharing on electronic media through Prasar Bharati Corporation to the ensuing General Election to the State Legislative Assemblies of Goa, Punjab, Manipur, Uttarakhand & Uttar Pradesh -2017.
           
The facilities of use of broadcast time and telecast time will be available only to ‘National Parties’ and ‘Recognized State Parties’ in respect of Goa, Punjab, Manipur, Uttarakhand & Uttar Pradesh.
 
THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THE SCHEME ARE AS FOLLOWS:

2.         A base time of 45 minutes will be given to each National Party and Recognized State Party (recognized in respect of Goa, Punjab, Manipur, Uttarakhand & Uttar Pradesh) uniformly on the Regional Kendras of Doordarshan network and All India Radio network in the above mentioned States/UTs.
 
3.         The additional time to be allotted to the parties has been decided on the basis of the poll performance of the parties in the last assembly election from the respective above mentioned States/UTs.
 
4.         In a single session of broadcast, no party will be allocated more than 15 minutes.
 
Date of Telecast/Broadcast:
 
5.         The period of broadcast and telecast will be between the last date of filing the nominations for the first phase of poll and two days before the date of poll (in each phase) in the respective of above mentioned States/UTs.
 
6.         The Prasar Bharati Corporation in consultation with the Commission will decide the actual date and time for broadcast and telecast. This will be subject to the broad technical constraints governing the actual time of transmission available with the Doordarshan and All India Radio.
 
            Submission of Transcripts in advance:
 
7.         The guidelines prescribed by the Commission for telecast and broadcast will be strictly followed. The parties will be required to submit transcripts and recording in advance. The parties can get this recorded at their own cost in studios, which meet the technical standards prescribed by the Prasar Bharati Corporation or at the Doordarshan/All India Radio Kendra. They can, in the alternative, have these recorded in the studios of Doordarshan and All India Radio by advance requests. In such cases, the recordings may be done at the State Capital and at timings indicated by Doordarshan/All India Radio in advance.
 
            Panel Discussions and Debate:
 
8.         In addition to the broadcast by parties, the Prasar Bharati Corporation will organize a maximum of two panel discussions and/or debates on the Kendra/Station of Doordarshan/All India Radio. Each eligible party can nominate one representative to such a programme.

While reporting on the actual campaign, a newspaper may not leave out any important point raised by a candidate and make an attack on his or her opponent.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has given its ex-post facto approval for interest waiver for the two  months of November and December, 2016 for farmers accessing short term  crop loans from Cooperative Banks.  The decision also provides for  interest subvention to National Bank for Agricultural and Rural  Development (NABARD) on additional refinance by NABARD to Cooperative  Banks.
Farmers in the whole of India availing short term crop loans, from Cooperative Banks will be benefitted.
The decision intends to ensure availability of resources with  Cooperative Banks help farmers in easily accessing crop loans from  Cooperative Banks to overcome the difficulties in view of the reduction  in availability of cash for carrying out Rabi operations.
Additional resources are to be provided to Cooperative Banks through  NABARD for refinance to the Cooperative Banks on account of interest  waiver of two months for November and December, 2016.   This will be  extended by Cooperative Banks to the farmers in the current financial  year 2016-17.  An additional financial liability of Rs. 1060.50 crore  will be required for this purpose.      A sum of Rs. 15, 000 crore  allocated during 2016-17 to implement the Interest Subvention Scheme  (ISS) has already been utilised.
 Background:
a)	The Government of India has, since 2006-07, been implementing  the Interest Subvention Scheme under which short-term crop loans upto  Rs.3 lakh are made available to the farmers at an interest rate of 7  percent per annum by the Public Sector. Banks, Regional Rural Banks and  Cooperative. Banks.  Farmers are provided with 3% interest subvention  for short term crop loan upto Rs. 3 lakhs on prompt repayment of the  loan. Thus, farmers have to effectively pay only 4% as interest for the  said crop loan.
b)	Due to the cancellation of legal tender character of old Rs. 500  and Rs.1000 notes and the resulting difficulty faced by the farmers in  en-cashing the cheques received against sale proceeds of their Kharif  produce in the mandis; and also their constraints with adequacy of cash  in carrying out Rabi operations and servicing the interest of the short  term crop loans, especially in view of the restrictions imposed on  Cooperative Banks, an interest waiver is being provided for a period of 2  months i.e. November & December 2016 to farmers who were disbursed  crop loan from Cooperative Banks between 01.04.2016 and 30.09.2016.
c)	The provision of additional financial resource of Rs. 1060.50  crore is on account of (i) meeting the cost of interest waiver for 2  months ( November and December, 2016) for crop loan disbursed by  Cooperative Banks between 01.04.2016 and 30. 09.2016 to farmers and (ii)  providing interest subvention and administrative cost  to NABARD on  short term borrowing of about Rs. 20,000 crore for on-lending to  Cooperatives Banks in the current financial year.

                India support the proposal of strengthening of AMIS - Shri Singh 
The  challenges of maintaining food and nutritional security need innovative  solutions through collaborative and coordinated polices- Shri Singh 
Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare addresses G-20 Agriculture Ministers’ meeting at Berlin 
 
Union  Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh  today addressed the G-20 Agriculture Ministers’ Meeting at Berlin,  Germany. In his addressed the Minister said that India will continue to  extend their support in early implementation of past commitments made at  the G20 Agriculture Ministers Meetings particularly on Research and  Development, collaboration and knowledge transfer, action to combat food  loss and waste, and information and communication technologies (ICT).  Shri Singh also supports the proposal of strengthening of AMIS and  underscores the importance of assessment of stocks and suggests sharing  of best practices in this regard.
The  Minister added that in India, ICT has proved to be an effective and  powerful medium to disseminate information on agronomic practices,  prices, fertilizer and pesticide use and weather and pest related  advisories. Many new initiatives have been taken in order to develop an  integrated approach for communication process in the agricultural  sector. These include: launch of agricultural web portals, mobile apps  and a dedicated broadcasting channel. Moreover, with  the objective to reform the agriculture marketing system in the  country, a National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) portal has been launched  which provides a pan-India electronic trading. This e-marketing platform  is expected to help farmers in facilitating better price discovery  through efficient, transparent and competitive marketing platform;  better marketing of agricultural produce; reducing wastages; and getting  market related information and with access to large number of buyers  from within and outside the State through transparent auction processes.
Shri Singh said that in order to  promote efficient irrigation practices in the country, a major  irrigation programme was launched by the government in 2015 with  emphasis on improving water-use efficiency through, water conservation/ rainwater harvesting and use of micro-irrigation. The programme  aims at providing end-to-end solutions in irrigation supply chain,  viz., water sources, distribution network and farm level applications  and extension services on new technologies and information. The  programme is being implemented in a mission mode with aim of completing  99 major and medium irrigation projects with the capacity of 76.03 lakh  hectare in a phased manner by December, 2019. 
Shri Singh said that the role of G20 economies in achieving the sustainable global food security assumes significant importance and there is a growing consensus that the challenges  of maintaining food and nutritional security need innovative solutions  through collaborative and coordinated polices among the member as well  as non-member countries. 
Union Agriculture & Farmers  Welfare Minister said that the world economy has made strides in  increasing the global food production, but the emerging challenges of increasing climate complexities, stress on natural resources,  degrading soil heath and fragmentation of land holdings pose serious  risks in sustaining this growth momentum. Other major issues  particularly faced by the developing and under developed economies  include poor marketing infrastructure, food losses and wastage, low  coverage of institutional agricultural credit, and insuring farmers’  produce from frequent climatic variations. Shri Singh said the  discussions on agriculture sector under the G20 German Presidency has  been rightly focused on the increasing stress on natural

                Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed the Plenary Session of 9th Berlin Agriculture Ministers’ Conference at Berlin, Germany today. In his addressed Shri Singh said that keeping the farmers’ interest foremost in our research programmes, there is a need to optimize the resources’ use efficiency.
 
            Shri Singh said that water is certainly the most critical resource for agriculture, gaining primacy even on other important inputs like soil. The competing use of water for agriculture and non-agricultural purposes, inefficient irrigation practices, injudicious use of pesticides, poor conservation infrastructure, and lack of governance have lead to increasing water scarcity and pollution worldwide.
 
            Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister said that distribution of water resources across the vast expanse of the country is uneven, therefore, as incomes rise the need for water also raises. Shri Singh said that as per the international norms, a country is classified as Water Stressed and Water Scarce, if per capita / year water availability goes below 1700 m3 and 1000 m3, respectively.  With 1544 m3 per capita / year water availability, India is already a water-stressed country and moving towards turning water scarce.
 
            Shri Singh further said that efficient use of irrigation water requires that water be applied to growing crops at appropriate times and in adequate amounts and the main task will be to (i) produce more from less water by efficient use of utilizable water resources in irrigated areas, (ii) enhance productivity of challenged ecosystems, i.e., rainfed and water logged areas, and (iii) utilize a part of grey water for agriculture production in a sustainable manner.
           
            Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister informed that most of the irrigation projects are operating at levels below the achievable efficiency of more than 50 per cent and there is enormous scope to improve the productivity and efficiency of irrigation systems which can be achieved both by technological as well as social interventions. Shri Singh said that it is estimated that with 10 per cent increase in the present level of efficiency in irrigation projects, an additional 14 million hectare area can be irrigated from the existing irrigation capacities which would involve a very modest investment compared to what is required for creating equivalent potential through new schemes. Therefore, there is need to adopt an integrated approach with emphasis on greater conservation and enhanced water use efficiency.
 
            Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare said that though India is among the leading producers of foodgrains in the world but India’s productivity vis-à-vis world average and highest yield (kg/ha) for major crops  cereals, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane and vegetables remains short of the highest levels achieved elsewhere in the world, except castor an industrial oil crop.  India has highest courage, production and productivity of castor in the world mainly because of hybrid technologies and water use efficiency in castor. Similarly, in livestock sector also, despite India being the top producer of milk, bovine productivity is only 1538 kg per year as compared to the world average of 2238 kg per year. The low productivity levels also indicate existence of enormous untapped potential. Shri Singh further said that efficiency-mediated improvement in productivity is the most viable option to raise production. Development of new crop varieties with more efficient photosynthesis and shorter duration would be of immense help in increasing cropping intensity.
 
            Shri Singh said that there are several technologies developed by our institutions that enable production of 'more crop per drop'. Adoption of Resource Conserving Technologies (RCTs) lead to an improvement in productivity compared to traditional hand transplanting at different locations. The prevailing farming situation in India calls for an integrated effort to address the emerging issues / problems. However, these integrated farming systems are required to be location specific and designed in such a manner that they lead to substantial improvement in energy efficiencies at the farm and help in maximum exploitation of synergies through adoption of close cycles. The Minister added that these systems also need to be socially acceptable, environment friendly and economically viable.

Shri Singh Urges to collectively resolve, to enhance the access to water, improve water quality, reduce water scarcity risks and manage Surplus Water
Shri Radha Mohan Singh addresses expert panel Meeting on International Green Week 2017 at Berlin, Germany
 
Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed the Expert Panel meeting on International Green Week-2017, today at Berlin, Germany. Shri Singh said that good seeds and fertilizer fail to achieve their full potential if plants are not optimally watered. The application of water should avoid wastage of a valuable resource and be in sympathy with the environment as a whole.
Shri Singh Said that in India, about 86% percent is used for agriculture, 6 percent for industries and 8 percent for domestic uses. It was 5,177 cubic meter in 1951 and will reach to 1,341 and 1,140 cubic meter in 2025 and 2050 i.e. near to water scarcity line, respectively. Shri Singh said that due to continuous fall in per capita water availability and increasing population of the nation, it becomes necessary to utilize every drop of available water efficiently and to produce more crops from the same available water and land, for providing Food security to growing population. It is a big challenge and responsibility on Agriculture sector to provide quality and quantity of food to the population with a scarce resource. Increasing Water Use Efficiency is a necessary step to counter the water scarcity issues, where water budgeting has to be done.
Shri Singh said that currently India and other countries faced major issues related to sustainable management of water and the issues are over exploitation of ground water resources; lack of proper crop alignment; low water use efficiency (WUE); lack of awareness among farmers; improper recycling and reuse of water, and problems related to industries
 Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister informed that to overcome such challenges Government of India have been launched various plans/schemes for sustainable use of Water:
(a)   Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) (Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Project) has been formulated on 1st July, 2015 with the vision of extending the coverage of irrigation ‘Har Khet ko pani’ (that means water to every farm) and improving water use efficiency ‘More crop per drop' in a focused manner with end to end solution on source creation, distribution, management, field application and extension activities.  The scheme is expected to ensure access to efficient delivery and application of water at every farm thereby enhancing agricultural production and productivity.  
(b)  National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) has objective of making agriculture more productive, sustainable, and remunerative and climate resilient by promoting location specific integrated/composite farming systems; soil and moisture conservation measures; comprehensive soil health management; efficient water management practices and mainstreaming rainfed technologies.
(c)  National Water Mission has objective of “conservation of water, minimizing wastage and ensuring its more equitable distribution both across and within states through integrated water resources development and management”.
 Shri Singh emphasized that the decision we made, the policy we formulated and the commitment to make all these happen, go a long way to make the world a better place.  Therefore, he recommend that
 
(a)    Greater efficiency in irrigation be pursued vigorously.  This can be achieved through proper designing of irrigation system for reducing water conveyance loss. Adoption of water saving technologies such as sprinkler and drip irrigation system have proven extremely effective in not just water conservation but also leading to higher yields with better quality of produce by delivering water in a controlled manner in parts of the plant where it is most efficiently absorbed.
(b)   The concept of multiple use of water must be popularized. Multiple use of water approach generates more income benefits, decreases vulnerability by allowing more diversified livelihood strategies and increases sustainability of ecosystem.
 
(c)    Emphasis should be given on water resources conservations through watershed development in suitable areas and development of micro-water structures for rainwater harvesting.
(d)   Specialized solution must be found and adopted for chronically water stressed areas where the normal measures may not be effective. Connecting highly water stressed areas with perennial source of water through linking of rivers or water grids is one such option.
 
(e)    Cultivation of coarse cereals particularly millets, which are pronounced  as nutri-cereals, low water requiring and climate resilient crops may be supported to meet the growing demand of safe and nutritious food worldwide.
 
Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister urges to collectively resolve to enhance the access to water, improve water quality, reduce water scarcity risks and manage surplus water. 
 
Earlier, Shri Radha Mohan Singh on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare of the Republic of India, thanks the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture of Germany for the meticulous arrangements made for this meeting, in general and particularly for bringing all of us here together to discuss water management in Agriculture which indeed a key in feeding the world.

                The meeting of Joint Hindi Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare was organized today under the chairmanship of Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh today here. Apart from the members of the committee, the Minister of State for Agriculture and farmers Welfare Shri Parashottam  Rupala was also participated in the meeting of the Committee. The Joint Hindi Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare was constituted on 24 August 2016. It was the first meeting after the committee was constituted.
During the discussions carried out in the meeting, the members of the committee expressed their satisfaction about the use of official language Hindi in the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and its departments. They emphasized that more and more official work should be performed in Hindi, the official language of the Union.
After the discussion, Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare expressed his views while addressing the gathering that most of policies/schemes as well as activities concerned with Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare relate to farmers and common man. Therefore, it is our duty that we should use Hindi as much as possible while implementing policies/schemes related to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in the business of Central Government. Simultaneously, it will be useful to provide knowhow of such schemes to the people in non Hindi speaking states through their vernacular languages. Shri Singh concluded the meeting by extending his gratitude to all the members.

Per  capita availability of milk in India is 337 gram/day as compared to the  average world per capita availability of 229 gram/day.
 
The  milk production has registered a growth rate of 6.28% during 2014-16,  which is higher than last years growth rate of about 4 per cent and  three times more than the world average growth of 2.2%.
 
To  encourage farmers for increasing milk production, it is imperative that  milk collection facilities need to be upgraded and farmers be given  remunerative prices for their produce: Radha Mohan Singh
 
Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh has  said that milk production has become a major economic activity amongst  rural households and farmers are adopting dairying along with  agriculture for augmenting their incomes. Shri Singh stated this  today  during the inter-session meeting of the Parliamentary Consultative  Committee of Ministry of Agriculture in New Delhi. Implementation of  National Dairy Plan was also discussed during the meeting.
Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that about 70 million rural households are engaged in milk production.  The  small and marginal farmers & landless labourer produce about one to  three litres of milk per day and are responsible for production of most  of the milk for the country. About 78 percent farmers in India are  small and marginal, who own about 75 percent of female bovine but own  only 40 percent farm land.   Milk  contributes to one third of gross income of rural households and in case  of landless its contribution is half in their gross income.
Agriculture  Minister said that India continues to hold the number one position  among milk producing nations of the world since 1998.  India has largest bovine population in the world (18.4 percent share).  Milk  production in India has increased from 22 million tonne in 1970 to 156  million tonne in 2015-16, which shows a growth of 700 percent during  last 46 years.   As a result, the  per capita availability of milk in India is 337 gram/day as compared to  average world per capita availability of 229 gram/day.
Shri Singh  said that during last two years 2014-16, milk production has registered  a growth rate of 6.28 percent, which is more than last year growth rate  of about 4 percent and more than three times higher than the world  growth average of 2.2 percent.  If  wheat and paddy is combined together, even then, in Gross Value  Addition (GVA) of Rs.4.92 crore in 2014-15, the contribution of milk is  more than 37 percent.  About 54 percent of milk produced in the country is surplus, out of which about 38 percent is handled by the organized sector.  The Co-operatives and private dairy organisations have equal share in it.  Shri Singh said that women participation in dairying is about 70 per cent.
Union  Agriculture Minister said that in order to encourage the farmers for  increasing milk production, it is imperative that milk collection  facilities need to be upgraded and farmers be given remunerative price  for their produce.  This is possible only when an effective management system is in place to link the farmers to the market.  Shri Singh said that BPL households, small and marginal farmers will be encouraged to rear descript indigenous breeds.
Shri Radha Mohan Singh  said that the National Bovine Breeding and Dairy Development Programme  (NPBBDD) has been started in 2014-15 converging four existing  programmes.  The objective of this programme is to prepare a comprehensive and scientific programme to meet the increasing demand for milk.  The programme has two components – National Bovine Breeding programme (NPBB) and National Dairy Development Programme (NPDD).  The  NPBB focusses on expanding field coverage for artificial insemination  network, monitoring of programmes for indigenous breed development and  conservation in the breeding areas.  The  NPDD is focusing on creating and strengthening of infrastructure for  milk unions/federations for production, procurement, processing &  marketing of milk and training of dairy farmers and extension.
Shri  Radha Mohan Singh directed the officials to incorporates the  suggestions given by the members on the issue and to speed up the  research.

                 Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that Central Government is bound to promote the coconut cultivation and related activities in Bihar. Shri Singh told that since 2014 a total amount of Rs 409.06 lakhs has been sanctioned for implementing the schemes on Coconut cultivation in Bihar.

Coconut Development Board was established on 12 January 1981.
 
Union Agriculture Minister told that Regional Office of the Coconut Development Board was shifted to Guwahati, Assam from Patna, Bihar on the basis of recommendations of a committee constituted under the chairmanship of ICAR in 2009. A central team was constituted by the Central Government focussing on the productivity of coconut in Bihar. This team has recommended to open a new and fourth Regional Office of the Board at Patna in place of State Centre Patna which was agreed upon by the Coconut Development Board in its 119th Board meeting held on 30.01.2015.
 
Shri Radha Mohan Singh also said that India is the global leader in production and productivity of coconut. Coconut is cultivated in 16 states and three union territories in an extent of 2.14 million ha. The crop sustains more than one crore farmer families of the country through cultivation, processing, marketing and trade related activities. In Bihar, Coconut is grown in 14,900 hectares producing 141.38 million nuts. 
 
Shri Singh said that Kosi region in North Bihar which comprises places on either sides of the Kosi river is suitable for coconut cultivation. It is estimated that nearly 50,000 hectares of potential area in Bihar is available for coconut cultivation, mainly in North Bihar under irrigated condition. Union Agriculture Minister said that CDB aims to equip the coconut farmers in production, processing, marketing and export of coconut and its value added products thus making India the world leader in production, productivity, processing for value addition and export of coconut. Bihar belongs to nontraditional coconut cultivated area and special focus is being given for development of coconut sector in the state.
 
Shri Radha Mohan Singh further said that Establishment of a Farmers Training Centre, attached to the Regional Office, Patna has also been initiated. The Farmers Training Centre is expected to impart skills to farmers. The centre will strengthen coconut cultivation and industry in the state.

The immediate release of the fishermen presently in custody was announced following the ministerial level talks. 
Both  sides agreed to a set of Standard Operating Procedures to release and  handing over of fishermen in each other’s custody on completion of  respective legal and procedural formalities. 
 
India and Sri Lanka held Ministerial level  talks on fishermen issues today, 2 January 2017 in Colombo. Minister of  Agriculture & Farmers Welfare of India Shri Radha Mohan Singh met  with Minister for Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development of Sri  Lanka Mr. Mahinda Amaraweera. The talks followed the first meeting of  the Joint Working Group (JWG) on fisheries held in New Delhi on 31  December 2016. The JWG,constituted in pursuance of the decision taken at  the Ministerial meeting held in New Delhi on 5 November 2016, was  co-chaired by Secretary (Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries),  India and Secretary (Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development), Sri  Lanka. 
 The Ministers exchanged views on possible  mechanisms to help find a permanent solution to the fishermen issues.  The co-chairs of the JWG briefed the Ministers on the outcome of the  first JWG meeting for consideration of the Ministers and further  directions to take the process forward. 
 
Both sides agreed to a set of Standard  Operating Procedures (SOPs) to expedite the release and handing over of  fishermen in each other’s custody on completion of respective legal and  procedural formalities. The immediate release of the fishermen presently  in custody was announced following the ministerial level talks.
 
As part of the Confidence Building  Measures (CBMs) agreed to by both sides, it was decided to intensify  cooperation on patrolling and to institute periodic interaction between  the Coast Guard of the two countries. An understanding was reached to  ensure that there was no physical harm or loss of life while  apprehending fishermen by Navy and Coast Guard of the two countries. It  was agreed to explore the possibility of introducing effective tracking  systems for the fishing vessels and making the use of onboard  communication equipment mandatory.
 
The Ministers appreciated the efforts  taken by the JWG in operationalizing the “Hotline” between Indian and  Sri Lankan Coast Guard, which would ensure quick decision making and  response.
 
Both sides discussed the issue of  releasing fishing vessels in each other’s custody. The Indian side  requested for the immediate release of Indian fishing vessels. The Sri  Lankan side agreed to consider the request in view of the progress being  made by the JWG.
 
The Sri Lankan side reiterated that the  practice of bottom trawling needs to end at the earliest. The Indian  side assured that bottom trawling would be phased out in a graded  time-bound manner within a practicable timeframe keeping in mind the  capacity building of the fishermen who have to be diversified into deep  sea fishing as well as other coastal fisheries activities including  mariculture, pearl farming, seaweed culture, etc. The Sri Lankan side  was briefed about the measures already instituted including the decision  to construct a new fishing harbour at Mookaiyur in Ramanathapuram  district of Tamil Nadu, and the capacity building programme for Indian  fishermen on deep sea fishing that commences tomorrow at Chennai and  Kochi. 
 
The next JWG meeting will be held in  Colombo in April 2017 to review the progress made in addressing the  fishermen issues in a comprehensive manner.

                Union  Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs,  Shri Ananth Kumar presided over the signing of Memorandum of  Understanding (MoU) between the Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI) and National Yuva Cooperative Society Ltd. (NYCS)  here today, with the objective to setup 1000 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya  Janaushadhi Kendras in both urban and rural places of the country, as a  part of ""Mission 3000"" kendras by March 2017. Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya,  Minister of State for Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shipping, Road  Transport & Highways was also present on the occasion.
 
Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP), an initiative of the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Government of India, is a mission to make quality medicines accessible to all citizens of the country at affordable prices. The BPPI is the nodal implementation agency for the PMBJP Scheme.
 
Speaking on the progress of PMBJP, Shri Ananth Kumar  said that the number of Janaushadhi Kendras have seen a drastic  seven-fold jump in the last two and half years to over 750 currently.  Further, around 20,000 applications have already been received and over 5,000 have been accorded in-principle approval  for setting up of Janaushadhi Kendras in the country. Government  envisions to establish Jansaushadhi kendras in every block & gram  panchayat across the country, he added.
 
Shri Kumar reiterated Prime Minister Shri Narendra  Modi’s vision to provide ‘Swasthya Suraksha’, by making affordable  quality medicines accessible to every citizen of the country. This  government is working to promote the indigenous generic drug industry  and make it globally competitive. The Minister added that the PMBJP is a  step in this direction which would, on one hand, drastically reduce the  out of pocket health expenditure for the common man and give an impetus  to the Make in India mission in the pharma sector.
 
Addressing the gathering, Shri Mandaviya said that the Government is actively pursuing the goal of ‘Affordable Medicines for All’ through the PMBJP, under which currently there are over 750 stores with a portfolio containing 600 drugs and 154 surgicals & consumables. He added that by joining hands with NYCS, the energy of the youth of the country would be channelized in achieving this goal.
 
There is an active financial support extended by the government to the extent of Rs. 2.5  lakh in the form of financial assistance to the kendras setup in  Government hospitals and incentives to individuals, with special and  softer terms to SC, ST and differently-abled persons. 
 
Other  dignitaries present during the event were Shri Jai Priye Prakash,  Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Shri Biplab Chatterjee, CEO,  BPPI, Shri Rajesh Pande, President, NYCS along with other senior  officers of the Ministry.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has given its approval to transfer 11.35 acres of land to Airports  Authority of India (AAI) by way of exchanging equivalent land of AAI at  Anisabad. The proposed land at Patna Airport will be used for expansion  of the airport and construction of new terminal building along-with  other associated infrastructures. The State Government has also agreed  in principle for transfer of the land.
The new terminal building will be having a capacity of 3 million  passengers per annum which will not only enhance the airport capacity  but also provide convenience to general public.
Background:
The existing terminal building at Patna Airport was built for a  capacity of 0.5 million passengers per annum, against which 1.5 million  passengers per annum are already using the airport. This has led to  extreme crowding in the terminal building.

                Airports Authority of India (AAI), the implementing agency for the Regional Connectivity Scheme (UDAN) has received 45 initial proposals from 11 bidders covering more than 200 RCS routes as the deadline for submitting initial proposals came to an end on 16th Jan 2017. These initial proposals cover as many as 65 airports, of which there are 52 un-served and 13 under-served airports as per the provisions of the scheme. Counter-bids have now been invited against these initial proposals, the last date of submission for which is 1stFeb. 2017. The routes or networks will be awarded to the bidders who quote the lowest requirement of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) against such routes. To ensure that operations on ground start with minimum time-gap after the bidding is completed, parallel action has also been initiated by the Ministry of Civil Aviation with AAI, State Governments, DGCA and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.
It may be recalled that with the twin objectives of promoting balanced regional growth and making flying affordable for masses, the Ministry of Civil Aviation had launched the Regional Connectivity Scheme (UDAN) on 21st Oct. 2016. RCS was a key component of the National Civil Aviation Policy which was released by the Ministry on 15th June 2016. The scheme, which would be in operation for a period of 10 years, envisages providing connectivity to un-served and under-served regions of the country through revival of existing air-strips and airports. This would be achieved through a financial stimulus in the form of Central and State government concessions, as well as Viability Gap Funding to the interested airlines to kick-off operations from such airports, so that the passenger fares are kept affordable. The fare for a one hour journey of approximately 500 km on a fixed wing aircraft or for a 30 minute journey on a helicopter would be capped at Rs. 2,500 under the scheme, with proportionate pricing for routes of different lengths / duration.
            The Union Minister of Civil Aviation Sh. P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, while expressing satisfaction with the response received under the scheme, conveyed that this is a significant step ahead in realizing our Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of ‘connecting the un-connected and serving the un-served’. The scheme is likely to give a major boost to tourism activities and employment generation in hinterland and Tier-II and Tier-III cities, he added.

Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman has said that the  services sector today is knowledge driven and alongwith technology has  on important role to play in economic growth. Addressing the curtain  raiser conference of the GES(Global Exhibition on Services)2017 she said  the 3rd edition of GES will build on the success of the first two GES  events held in 2015 and 2016. 

Commerce Secretary Mrs Rita Teotia also emphasized  the importance  of  services sector in employment generation and economic activity. 

GES 2017 explores new verticals. There are 20 sectors that are being  tapped as compared to 17 sectors in the previous years. The new areas  being unveiled are Retail and E-Commerce, Sports Services and Railway  Services. The exhibition area in the third edition is spread over 42,000  sq. mts. 

GES 2017 promises to a vibrant and enriching experience with the  expected presence of important countries, dignitaries and thought  leaders. Some new initiatives  planned to be held alongside GES 2017 are  a festival of Indian cuisine and TedX style Talks.The food sector has  emerged in India as a high-growth and high-return sector due to its  immense potential for value addition, particularly in the area of food  processing. 

A strong services sector backed by a manufacturing sector targeted for  higher growth through initiatives like Make in India, can play a pivotal  role in the growth of our economy and enable it to find its rightful  place amongst world economies. Government  recognizes the importance of  the service sector today as an agent of change and transformation for  the country. As per provisional numbers released by RBI for the current  financial year, the service export figures for April to September 2016  have touched US $ 80 billion as against US $ 77 billion for the  corresponding period of the previous fiscal – a rise of almost 4%.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime  Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal of India Trade  Promotion Organisation (ITPO), a Mini Ratna Category-1 Company under the  Department of Commerce, for redevelopment of Pragati Maidan by setting  up of a world class Integrated Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (IECC)  at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi.
The total cost of the project will be Rs.2,254 crore.  ITPO will  utilise Rs.1,200 crore out of its free reserves towards funding of the  project.  ITPO will raise institutional loan / soft loan / external aid /  land monetization for the balance amount of Rs.1,054 crore with  government guarantee for the amount of institutional loan.
The redevelopment of Pragati Maidan is envisaged in two phases.   Phase-1 redevelopment is expected to complete by May 2019.  Phase-1 of  the project will result in redevelopment of nearly 3.26 lakh sq.mtrs.   After redevelopment, the exhibition space will be doubled to 1.19 lakh  sq.mtr. as against 65,000 sq.mtr. presently.  Redevelopment will also  include creation of a state-of-the-art Convention Center with seating  capacity of 7,000 persons.
For execution of this mega project, ITPO has assigned the work to  National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd. (NBCC) as a Project  Management Consultant.  ITPO would call for global bidding for selection  of project executor(s) for construction of the project.
With India’s growing international profile and increasing presence  at summit, ministerial and other levels, a need has been felt to have a  modern world class Integrated Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre at New  Delhi to provide an appropriate venue for international events.  Present  facilities are far short of international standards.
To ease road congestion, grade separator will be provided at the  junction of Mathura Road and Bhairon Road.  Also, there will be direct  connectivity through subway from Mathura Road to Ring Road across  Pragati Maidan.

A.    Introduction:Public procurement forms a very important part of Government activity and reform in Public Procurement is one of the top priorities of the present Government. Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is a very bold step of the Government with the aim to transform the way in which procurement of goods and services is done by the Government Ministries/Departments, PSUs, autonomous bodies etc.
B.     Background:GeM owes its genesis to the recommendations of two Groups of Secretaries made to the Hon’ble PM in January 2016. They recommended setting up of a dedicated e-market for different goods & services procured/sold by Government/PSUs besides reforming DGS&D. Subsequently, the Hon’ble FM in his Budget speech for FY 2016-17, announced setting up of a technology driven platform to facilitate procurement of goods and services by various Ministries and agencies of the Government.
DGS&D with technical support of NeGD (MeitY) has developed GeM portal for procurement of both Products & Services. The portal was launched on 9th August 2016 by the Hon’ble Commerce & Industry Minister. Procurement on GeM has been authorized by GFR by adding Rule 141A (DoE OM dated 3rd May 2016). Presently more than 7400 products in about 150 product categories and hiring of transport service are available on GeM POC portal. Transactions for more than                                                              Rs 140 Crore have already been processed through GeM.
GeM is a completely paperless, cashless and system driven e-market place that enables procurement of common use goods and services with minimal human interface.
C.    Benefits of GeM to the Government, Sellers and the Indian industry and economy
1.      Transparency: GeM eliminates human interface in vendor registration, order placement and payment processing, to a great extent. Being an open platform, GeM offers no entry barriers to bonafide suppliers who wish to do business with the Government. At every step, SMS and e-Mail notifications are sent to both buyer, his/her head of organization, paying authorities as well as sellers. Online, cashless and time bound payment on GeM is facilitated through integration with PFMS and State Bank Multi Option System (SBMOPS); web-services integration is being extended to payment systems of Railways, Defence, major PSUs and State Governments. Seamless processes and online time-bound payment, which is also mandated by the OM issued by Department of Expenditure, has given confidence to the vendors and reduced their ‘administrative’ cost involved in pursuing officers for timely payment.  
2.      Efficiency: Direct purchase on GeM can be done in a matter of minutes and the entire process in online, end to end integrated and with online tools for assessing price reasonability. For procurements of higher value, the bidding/RA facility on GeM is among the most transparent and efficient, in comparison to e-procurement systems in vogue within the Government sector. For creating a bid/RA, the buyer does not need to create his/her own technical specifications as they have been standardized on GeM. The bid/RA can be created in a matter of minutes and finalized within a minimum of 7 days.The bid/RA is notified via e-mail and SMS to all the eligible suppliers; new suppliers are also notified once they get themselves registered online on GeM and are determined as ‘eligible’ by the system. GeM bidding/RA therefore ensures competition, fair play, speed & efficiency and leads to proper price discovery. The reasonableness of the rates can also be confirmed through online comparison with market price on leading e-Commerce portals. Very soon, GeM will also start getting feeds from various other public procurement portals in order to ensure that the same item has not been procured at a lesser rate by any other Government agency, from the same or a different vendor.The reasonability of price would be further strengthened by way of integration with GSTN and ICEGATE that will enable the buyer to ascertain the price of an item when it exited the factory gate or when it got imported into the country.   These would make GeM an extremely powerful tool in the hands of Government organizations to plan and procure.
3.      Secure and safe: GeM is a completely secure platform and all the documents on GeM are e-Signed at various stages by the buyers and sellers. The antecedents of the suppliers are verified online and automatically through MCA21, Aadhar and PAN databases. In addition, SEBI empaneled credit rating agencies are also being used for conducting third-party assessment of suppliers. This would further strengthen due diligence about the veracity of suppliers wanting to do business on GeM.For high value bids/RA on GeM, an e-Bank Guarantee is also being introduced. 
GeM is a far better system than the existing one which relies more on financial instruments (EMD in case of tenders for large procurements only) to guarantee good conduct by the suppliers. In the existing system, there is zero check on the antecedents of the suppliers for small value procurements (uptoRs 1 lakh) whose cumulative value is huge across the Government organizations. GeM does a 100% online verification of all vendors irrespective of the value of procurement. 
4.      Potential to support Make in India:On GeM, the filters for selecting goods which are Preferential Market Access (PMA) compliant and those manufactured by Small Scale Industries(SSI), enables the Government buyers to procure Make in India and SSI goods very easily. Easily accessible MIS also enables the administrators and policy makers to easily and effectively enforce the Government regulations on PMA and SSI sourcing. After the launch of GeM it has been noticed that several leading computer manufacturers have placed PMA compliant products on GeM. 
5.      Savings to the Government: The transparency, efficiency and ease of use of the GeM portal has resulted in a substantial reduction in prices on GeM, in comparison to the tender, Rate Contract and direct purchase rates. The average prices on GeM are lower by atleast 15-20%, and in some cases even upto 56%. GeM is also doing Demand Aggregation for items that are to be procured by various Central/State Government Departments. Demand Aggregation is expected to further drive the prices south, by way of standardization of specifications and economy of scale. Demand aggregation for most of the common use goods and services is estimated to result in annual savings to the tune ofRs 40,000 Crore per annum. If pursued to its logical conclusion, GeM would eventually emerge as the National Public Procurement Portal, keeping in tune with the Global best practices; most of the OECD countries, like USA, South Korea, UK, Singapore etc, have a single NPPP and as a result annual savings of billions of dollars are made in public procurement, besides giving a fillip to the domestic industry.

 Commerce & Industry Minister Smt Nirmala Sitharaman launched Rubber Soil Information System (RubSIS), an online system for recommending application of appropriate mix of fertilizers to the specific plantations of rubber growers depending upon their soil nature in New Delhi today. Smt Rita Teaotia, Commerce Secretary and other senior officials of the Ministry and Rubber Board were present at the occasion.
 
RubSIS, developed by Rubber Research Institute of India (RRII) under the Rubber Board in collaboration with three agencies viz Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Kerala, National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, ICAR and National Remote Sensing Center, ISRO, brings soil data to the fingerprints of rubber growers and recommends the optimum mix and quantities of chemical fertilizers that his holding requires. It is a cost effective tool for sustainable &scientific management of rubber growing soils. Apart from preventing indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and soil degradation, adoption of RubSIS will lead to reduction in the cost of production of rubber, increase in productivity and reduction in environmental pollution. 
The scientific and user friendly online fertiliser recommendation system was launched today for Kottayam (Kerela), the largest rubber growing district of India which will be extended to the entire traditional rubber growing region i.e. the states of Kerela and Tamilnadu this year.

The  Commerce  and Industry Minister, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, held a meeting with  various incubators and accelerators to gather feedback, hear their  concerns and address key challenges faced by them in the Startup  ecosystem. This is in continuation to her previous initiative to reach  out to various stakeholders of the ecosystem.
Incubators  are critical for driving the growth of startups at all stages of their  entrepreneurial journey. They help provide mentorship & handholding  support and above all foster a culture of innovation. It is therefore  incumbent on the Government of India to support the  incubators/accelerators so that they in turn can nurture startups, which  would help India become a nation of job creators instead of job  seekers.
It is hence important to address the challenges, issues and concerns faced by the incubators.
Some of the key points of discussion and suggestions that came up during the interaction were:
·        Umbrella recognition of incubators, accelerators, co-working spaces and mentors as ‘Startup builders’
·        Service  tax exemption is being currently provided to incubators duly recognized  by Government; it should be extended to other incubators as well.
·        The requirement of seed stage funding for Startups was highlighted.  Incubators  should be given grant by Government to help Startups at the initial  stages. E.g. PRISM under DSIR which gives a grant of Rs. 2 lacs for  startups at the seed funding stage is extremely helpful; a similar seed  stage funding from 5-10 lacs for startups was proposed.
·        Startups  registered with incubators need to get their valuation done which is a  financial burden on them. Startups below a particular threshold may be  exempted from the same.
·        Greater corporate engagement with incubators may be facilitated.
·        Section 35(2AA) of Income Tax Act may be extended to incubators as well
·        Marketing  and funding support to startups is critical, hence a separate fund for  incubators needs to be created especially through CSR mandate for  corporates.
·        A Central repository of all schemes and funds available under the Government for the benefit of startups should be created.
·        State Governments and municipal bodies may be requested to extend relaxed procurement norms to startups.
·        The  current FCRA regulations prohibits charitable trusts to use the foreign  funds received by them as investment in startups as such investments  are treated as speculation.
·        A national survey can be undertaken to collate and address all challenges of startups on a common platform
 
The  Commerce and  Industries Minister thanked everyone for giving the valuable suggestions  which will help build a conducive Startup ecosystem in the country. She  assured that the department will take the suggestions forward by  engaging with the ministries concerned.

Three sector specific  needs can broadly be categorised into interventions required for agri  & marine products, for forest produce and for industrial products. 
The  Minister drew the attention of the States to expedite the preparation  of the export strategies in line with the Foreign Trade Policy and in  the appointment of Export Commissioners for the state.  She  requested that the Export Commissioner be made the single window focal  point for the interaction with the exporters from the State.

Shri  C.P.Singh, Minister from Jharkhand stressed the need to increase export  of agri products, as Jharkhand is a major producer of agri products.  He informed that they have formulated an export policy recently.  He said Jharkhand is proactive in taking up labour reforms. 
 The  Kerala Industry & Trade Minister, Shri A.C Moideen, sought  proactive measures to curb liberal imports of agricultural products to  ensure the livelihood security of domestic farmers.

                Hon’ble Ministers and senior officials from the States and other Ministries welcome to the second meeting of the Council for Trade Development and Promotion.
 
            As you are aware, the objective of this Council is to develop partnerships with the States with the aim of boosting international trade. 
 
            Last January 8th we had a very constructive dialogue with the State Ministers regarding measures for creating and augmenting an enabling environment in the States to boost International trade. 
 
             In my invitation letter dated 31st Oct, I had annexed the status and action taken on the various issues raised by you in the first meeting of this council in last January
 
            Though, since last January we have managed to contain our trade deficit due to controls on imports, there is an immediate need to synergize our efforts and jointly take appropriate steps to boost India’s exports - which is the only sustainable way in today’s international trade environment 
 
            As you already know, there is a slowdown in world economy which has resulted in decrease in some of India’s traditional exports. 
 
            We would welcome your suggestions on steps required to improve the export competitiveness of our products and on how can we partner in the adoption of such measures to create an environment conducive for exports.
 
            I exhort the Members to use this platform to articulate their perspective on the Trade Policy and work jointly with us to address impediments to trade and infrastructure gaps which adversely affect India’s exports. 
 
            One such area which requires immediate intervention is that of facilities for testing, certification, trace-back, packaging and labelling.  
 
            As some of you may have seen on the Indian trade portal, a hundred to hundred and fifty SPS notifications and a similar number of TBT notifications are being issued by WTO member countries each month. Around 50% to 60% of these measures have the potential to impact our trade. 
 
            There Sector Specific needs can broadly be categorised into interventions required for agri and marine products, for forest produce and for industrial products. 
 
            I request the States to enhance their co-operation with Central Agencies for setting up common facilities like testing labs, training institutes as well as packaging and storage support to industry. 
 
            In the last meeting I had requested the States to consider higher allocation of resources for export infrastructure from their increased devolution of funds to which I expected that at least the ongoing ASIDE projects would be completed by the States from their resources. I am still awaiting an affirmative action on this from the States.
            
            However, since almost all the states had expressed their wish for a central scheme which supports export infrastructure, we have acted on your suggestion and are trying to formulate a scheme which could provide financial support and supplement your efforts to create export infrastructure. 
 
            I hope we can soon succeed in achieving a consensus for the roll out of this scheme, which is very aptly titled as TIES or Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme. This would surely strengthen our TIES with the States
 
            States have also been requested to develop their Export Strategy aligned with the National Policy trade. So far seventeen States have prepared their export strategy.  I request the balance States to kindly expedite their export strategies. 
 
            Also Export Commissioners have been designated by twenty eight states. The remaining States may kindle expedite. I would request the States to use these export commissioners as focal points for institutionalised interactions with the Exporters from the State.
 
            I would also like to draw the attention of the States towards our services exports where we not only have a steady trade surplus but also a lot of untapped potential. 
 
            Our services trade surplus offsets our merchandise trade deficit to an extent and along with overseas remittances, keeps our current account deficit in check.
 
            While IT and IT enabled services have an overwhelming predominance in our services exports, these are largely restricted to the US and EU markets and are therefore vulnerable to any changes imposed by these two trading blocks. 
 
            There is thus a need to diversify our services exports basket by enabling more sectors and to breach more markets.
 
            Other areas like Medical tourism, nursing and healthcare, education, audio-visual media also afford an excellent potential which can be harnessed. 
 
            For this, we need to develop the right competencies like language skills for the East and North East Asian markets.
 
            I would like to take this opportunity to exhort the State Governments to develop and pursue appropriate export strategies in line with national Foreign Trade Policy and we would be happy to associate in such efforts.
 
            In conclusion, I would also like to reiterate my request to all the States to consider organizing bimonthly meetings with the exporters in their States to sort out their infrastructure and tax related issues which would go a long way in improving our trade competitiveness.

                The Commerce & Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman launched an IPR Enforcement Toolkit for Police today. The toolkit has been jointly prepared by Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM) and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).  This toolkit will be a ready reckoner for police officials across the country in dealing with IP crimes, specifically Trade Marks counterfeiting and Copyrights piracy. In addition to details of offences under various laws, it provides for checklists for registering a complaint and conducting search and seizures. It also lays down general guidelines for search and seizure in case of IP crimes. This toolkit will be provided to all state police departments across the nation and will assist them in dealing with the cases relating to Trademarks and Copyrights infringements.
The Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM) under the aegis of the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India is working to ensure effective implementation of the National IPR Policy 2016. Several measures have been taken by CIPAM to strengthen the IP ecosystem in the country.The National IPR Policy recognizes that awareness about IPRs and respecting IPRs is very crucial in a healthy IP ecosystem. Children are the future of a country, and we should inculcate respect for IPRs amongst them from an early age, so that they become responsible users of IPRs in the future. CIPAM is collaborating with the International Trademark Association (INTA) to launch an IPR Awareness campaign for schoolchildren, which would spread the message on IPRs in a creative and engaging manner, through the use of presentations and creatively illustrated posters and pamphlets which cover the basics on IPRs and the need to protect IPRs.
In order to strengthen the Enforcement mechanism, CIPAM has also organized seven batches of training programmes for Police officials in State of Andhra Pradesh and a three day training programme for APOs and Police Officials in State of Uttar Pradesh. Trainees enacted plays and participated in quizzes and other activities based on IPRs. CIPAM has also written to all the state police and judicial academies to undertake training of police and judicial officers on Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights.
CIPAM is actively facilitating International engagements in the field of Intellectual Property Rights. Two MoU on IPRs were recently signed with UK and Singapore. India-USA Workshop on Protection of Trade Secrets was successfully organized by CIPAM to discuss various aspects related to Trade Secrets and its impact on Industry.
CIPAM is looking forward to work with various stakeholders in its journey of making Creative India; Innovative India.

Finance  Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley and Minister of Communications Shri Manoj  Sinha launched the operations of the India Post Payments Bank (IPPB)  here today as two pilot branches at Raipur and Ranchi through video  conferencing from Delhi.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Jaitley said that about 650 IPPB  branches will be opened by September this year and that will have a  multiplier impact as far as banking in India is concerned. He said with  IPPB, banking at the doorstep will no longer remain a mere slogan, but  will become a reality due to huge postal network in the country. He said  that financial Inclusion is critical for the socio-economic development  of the country, but there are significant gaps in this area and a large  proportion of country’s population remain unbanked or underbanked. IPPB  will effectively leverage the ubiquitous post office network with its  pan-India physical presence, long experience in cash handling and  savings mobilization, backed by the ongoing project of IT-enablement, to  bridge this gap in Financial Inclusion.
In his address, Minister of Communications Shri Manoj Sinha has  commended the hard work done by the Department of Posts in setting up  the India Post Payments Bank and hoped that both organizations will work  in tandem to take the benefits of government schemes and financial  services that are not easily available in rural areas to customers  across the country and to the marginalized population in urban and rural  areas alike. He said, the objective of IPPB will be public service  rather than promoting commercial interests.
Secretary, Department of Posts, Shri B.V.Sudhakar said that the IPPB  is widely expected to be a game changer for financial inclusion in the  country as the USP of this initiative is doorstep banking, particularly  in the rural areas.
As mandated by the RBI, the India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) would  focus on providing basic financial services such as all kinds of  payments; including social security payments, utility bill payments,  person to person remittances (both domestic and cross-border), current  and savings accounts up to a balance of Rs 1 lac, distribution of  insurance, mutual funds, pension products and acting as business  correspondent to other banks for credit products especially in rural  areas and among the underserved segments of the society.
Set up us a 100% Government of India owned Public Limited Company  under the Department of Posts, it will open around 650 branches in  district HQ locations. All 1.55 lacs post offices including the 1.39 lac  of the rural post offices will be mapped to the IPPB branch at the  district headquarter and function as access points for IPPB. IPPB will  usher in state of the art internet and mobile banking platforms, digital  wallets and use innovative and emerging technologies to catalyse the  shift from a cash dominant to a less cash economy.
While many other banks and financial institutions are working on the  same theme, the USP of IPPB will be its ability to ease access and  handhold the adoption of new age banking and payments instruments among  citizen of all walks of life through the delivery by postmen and Grameen  Dak sevaks, savings agents and other franchisees who will take banking  to door steps. IPPB thus aspires to the most accessible, affordable and  trusted bank for the common man with the motto - “No customer is too small, no transaction too insignificant, and no deposit too little”.
Given ‘in principle’ approval by the RBI along with 10 other  aspirants on 19th Aug 2015, IPPB received the cabinet’s approval on 1st  June, 2016 and was incorporated as on 17th Sept, 2106. Today it became  the second payments bank to launch its operations. Having got its final  banking license from the RBI on the 20th Jan 2017 it has commenced  operations in record time of 10 days in partnership with the Punjab  National Bank, after obtaining all necessary approvals and registrations  from the RBI, NPCI etc.
A commemorative stamp and a logo of the new bank were also launched on the occasion.

A number of complaints from consumers have been  received that hotels and restaurants are following the practice of  charging 'service charge' in the range of 5-20%, in lieu of tips, which a  consumer is forced to pay irrespective of the kind of service provided  to him. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides that a trade practice  which, for the purpose of promoting the sale, use or the supply of any  goods or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or  deceptive practice, is to be treated as an unfair trade practice and  that a consumer can make a complaint to the appropriate consumer forum  established under the Act against such unfair trade practices. In this  context, the department of Consumer Affairs, Central Government has  called for clarification from the Hotel Association of India, which have  replied that the service charge is completely  discretionary and should a customer be dissatisfied with the dining  experience he/she can have it waived off. Therefore, it is deemed to be  accepted voluntarily.
The Department of Consumer Affairs has asked the  State Governments to sensitize the companies, hotels and restaurants in  the states regarding aforementioned provisions of the Consumer  Protection Act, 1986 and also to advise the Hotels/Restaurants to  disseminate information through display at the appropriate place in the  hotels/restaurants that the 'service charges"" are discretionary/  voluntary and a consumer dissatisfied with the services can have it  waived off.

This year, spectators at the Beating the Retreat ceremony will be  enthralled with the mesmerising and foot tapping music of the bands from  the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the State Police and Central  Armed Police Forces (CAPF). As many as 26 performances on the historic  Vijay Chowk, mostly composed by Indian musicians will thrill the  audience with patriotic fervour. The tunes to be rendered are ‘Singarh’,  ‘Patni Top’, ‘Mony Musk’, ‘Jak Wilson’, ‘General Tappy’, ‘The Gael’, ‘  Scotland the Brave’, ‘Jal Nidhi’, ‘Yaman’, ‘Sky Lark’, ‘Veer Bharat’,  ‘Pyari Bhumi’, ‘Take to the Sky’, ‘Victory Dhun’, ‘Air Force Colours’,  ‘Benihal’, ‘Indian Fleet’, ‘Admirals Ensignia’, ‘Jai Bharti’, ‘Appu’,  ‘Call of the Heart’, ‘Gulmarg’, ‘Drummers Call’, ‘Army Star’, ‘Abide  with Me’ and lastly the ever-popular ‘Sare Jahan Se Acha’. While the  tunes are a mix of Indian and Western compositions the dominance of the  Desi tunes will add special flavour to the ceremony.
The ceremony at the Vijay Chowk on January 29th every year marks the  culmination of the four-day-long Republic Day celebrations. This year,  16 Military Bands, 16 Pipes and Drums Bands from Regimental Centres and  Battalions are participating in Beating the Retreat ceremony. Besides  one each of Indian Navy and Indian Air Force band will also form part of  the event. Another band of the State Police and CAPF comprising Border  Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force and Delhi Police will also  take part.
The principal conductor of the Beating Retreat ceremony will be Sqn  Ldr G Jayachandran while Army bands conductor will be Subedar Major  Hemraj and the Navy and Air Force band commanders will be Master Chief  Petty Officer (Musician-I) Ramesh Chand and Junior Warrant Officer Ashok  Kumar respectively. The conductor of the State Police and CAPF bands  will be Inspector Lal Singh. Buglers will perform under the leadership  of Sub Parbat Singh and pipes and drums bands will play under the  instructions of Sub Maj Gopal Singh.
‘Beating the Retreat’ has emerged as an event of national pride when  the Colours and Standards are paraded. The ceremony traces its origins  to the early 1950s when Major Roberts of the Indian Army indigenously  developed the unique ceremony of display by the massed bands. ‘Beating  Retreat’ marks a centuries old military tradition, when the troops  ceased fighting, sheathed their arms and withdrew from the battlefield  and returned to the camps at sunset at the sounding of the Retreat.  Colours and Standards are cased and flags lowered. The ceremony creates  nostalgia for the times gone by.

It  will be followed by the ‘Globe formation’ comprising one C-17  Globemaster flanked by two Su-30 MKIs. Next in line will be the  fighters, where five Jaguars will fly in Arrowhead formation, another  five MiG-29 Air Superiority Fighters will fly in Fulcrum style. Then the  breath-taking ‘Trishul’ formation comprising three Su-30 MKIs of No. 24  Squadron would fly over the Rajpath, and once in front of the saluting  dais, the Su-30 MKI aircraft will split upwards, making a Trishul in the  sky. The flypast will conclude with another Su-30 MKI carrying out a  ‘Vertical Charlie’ manoeuvre over the saluting dais. 

The ceremony will culminate with the national anthem and release of balloons.

ASHU SINGH, CHIEF MECHANICAL ENGINEER (131980 – F) 
(POSTHUMOUSLY)
 

 
On 06 Mar 16, at about 1600 hrs, an incident of deck head lagging fire accompanied with heavy smouldering occurred in the ‘B’ Boiler Room of INS Viraat. The sailor showed exemplary courage and presence of mind in safeguarding machinery by taking correct procedural step in crash stopping B1 boiler which was last in use and securing other machinery in the vicinity. He took lead role in successfully fighting the fire relentlessly for 35 min with all other watch keepers and Standing Sea Fire Party (SSFP) in the extreme harsh conditions with intense heat and heavy smoke without thinking about his own safety thereby averting a major disaster. He also safeguarded the life of other fire fighters by guiding them to evacuate boiler room in time. 
 
In the process the sailor, undeterred and unmindful of his own life, safeguarded the life of men and propulsion machinery of the aircraft carrier, displaying conspicuous gallantry, exemplary leadership and presented an example of ""Service before Self"". The sailor displayed dauntless courage, most conspicuous gallantry, selfless service, outstanding professionalism and exemplary leadership disregarding the pain and suffocation and had sacrificed his own life while ensuring safety of fellow ship mates and the aircraft carrier.
 
This feat of courage by the sailor, in saving both, personnel and the equipment at the cost of his own life is an act worthy of recognition and is in keeping with the highest traditions of the Service, and therefore, (Late) Ashu Singh, Chief Mechanical Engineer is awarded Shaurya Chakra (Posthumously).
 
 
NAO SENA MEDAL (GALLANTRY)
RAKESH KUMAR, HULL ARTIFICER 4, (502230-H)
(POSTHUMOUSLY)
 

 
On  10 Jun 16, Rakesh Kumar, Hull Artificer 4, 502230-H of INS Vikramaditya, was part of the team assigned the task of overseeing fitment of a newly fabricated 1.2 m piece of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) pipe by two civilian contract-workers in Cofferdam 9K6, whose horizontal dimensions measure 2.1m X 0.76m. The sailor was assigned the task of connecting and supervising the operation of a submersible pump and was positioned in the Power Generation Room (PGR), one deck above the compartment containing the Cofferdam, with access to the Cofferdam being only through a long vertical ladder that led down from a narrow hatch.  During the pipe-replacement process, the sailor heard someone shouting from the compartment below and saw a civilian emerging from it in a semi-conscious state. The sailor went down the ladder, picked up the civilian on his shoulder and climbed up the vertical ladder to the PGR, laying him down under an AC vent. He then learnt that the other civilian was also unconscious in the Cofferdam. Without any thought to his own safety, the sailor clambered down the vertical ladder again and with no hesitation entered the Cofferdam where he saw his team leader wearing an Emergency Life saving Apparatus (ELSA) set and trying to pick up the civilian worker, who was lying prone in the well of the Cofferdam, partly covered with water. Rakesh, with all his strength, tried to lift the second civilian, but was unable to do so as his clothes were slippery and entangled with deck fittings in the narrow space. Despite knowing the dangers of the probable presence in the space of toxic gas and its consequences, Rakesh did not relent in his efforts and continued trying to bodily lift the civilian out of the Cofferdam in the hope of saving his life. He, however, lost track of time, and whilst continuing his vain but valiant efforts, also succumbed to the toxic gas inhalation and collapsed inside the Cofferdam. He was extricated from the compartment by a rescue team a few minutes later, but was unfortunately declared dead in the hospital.
 
It is evident from the act of the sailor that he with scant regard to his personal safety ventured into the congested cofferdam seeing a civilian worker shouting in semi-conscious state. The sailor was completely aware that the presence of dangerous and poisonous gases in the congested enclosed space will endanger the lives of the civilians working there. Even a moment’s delay would cause the civilians to lose their lives. Realising this, sailor rushed to the space and lifted the first civilian on his shoulder and climbed up the ladder and saved him. Thereafter, though the sailor was exhausted, showing rare grit of courage and valour he ventured into the congested space infested with the poisonous gases to save the second civilian. Whilst continuing his vain but valiant efforts, Rakesh Kumar, Hull Artificer 4 succumbed to the toxic gas inhalation. This feat of exemplary courage by the sailor, in saving the civilians working in the enclosed and congested space infested with the deadly poisonous gases of H2S with scant regard to the safety of his own life is an act worthy of recognition and is in keeping with the highest traditions of the Service, and therefore, (Late) Rakesh Kumar, Hull Artificer 4 is awarded Nao Sena Medal (Gallantry) (Posthumously).


NAO SENA MEDAL (GALLANTRY)
LT CDR NEERAJ KUMAR (06143-K)
 

 Lt Cdr Neeraj Kumar (06143-K) is the NBCD Officer onboard INS Trikand. At about 1820h on 08 June 2016, whilst transiting off Goa in heavy weather, INS Trikand was contacted on radio by Merchant Vessel MV Infinity One anchored off Grandi Island. MV Infinity One reported crack in starboard ship’s side with ingress of water causing ten degrees list being aggravated by heavy weather and swell, and requested de-flooding assistance in emergency. Immediately, INS Trikand closed MV Infinity to render assistance. Weather was extremely unfavourable, with heavy rain, low visibility, winds gusting to 25-29 KN, pitch dark night conditions and sea state 3-4. Undeterred by the challenging weather conditions, Lt Cdr Neeraj Kumar sprang into action and quickly mustered a four man Damage Control (DC) team along with dewatering pumps and leak stopping gears. During embarkation of the DC team and stores into the ship’s boat, the boat and ship were rolling excessively in the heavy seas and the scramble net swayed precariously throughout the descent into the boat. Keeping his cool and displaying unflinching courage, Lt Cdr Neeraj Kumar led from the front and ensured all men and stores were loaded into the boat in record time. Motivating his team all along the way and closely monitoring their movements, he led the team personally on an extremely demanding transit across the choppy seas to the marooned Merchant Vessel. Upon embarkation onboard the Merchant Vessel at 2020h on 08 June 2016, the MV crew were assessed to be poorly trained and motivated, with many seemingly in shock. The forward hold of MV Infinity was half flooded and the ship was listed excessively to starboard with sea/ swell breaking over the weather deck. The only access to the forward hold was via a catwalk that was on the starboard edge of the weather deck, which was constantly awash with sea and spray. Catwalk and upper decks were caked with bitumen dust from the ship’s cargo, which along with the heel to starboard, aggravated by the pitch black night and falling rain created treacherous underfoot conditions. The Forward Hold itself was in complete darkness and was accessible only via a narrow lobby above. All onboard pumps of the MV had burned out or suctions were choked by bitumen cargo in the hold. Displaying tremendous professional poise and composure in such trying conditions, Lt Cdr Neeraj Kumar marshalled his team expertly and swiftly rigged up portable submersible pumps in the forward hold of the MV. When MV crew were unable to provide power supply for the pumps, Lt Cdr Neeraj Kumar and his team proactively took matters into their own hands, searched all nearby compartments, identified compatible supply breakers and rigged up direct electrical tapping from those points to energise the pumps. After two hours of sustained de-flooding of the forward hold using the pumps operationalised by Lt Cdr Neeraj and his crew, the list of the MV was observed to gradually reduce and by 0315h on 09 June 2016, the list had reduced to five degrees and the MV was declared out of the danger by the Master. 
 
Military leadership, courage in adversity and ability to overcome all odds displayed by Lt Cdr Neeraj Kumar are in the best traditions of the naval service. Technical and seamanship skills as well as sheer guts displayed by the officer ensured successful rescue of a Merchant Vessel in distress at sea and saved the lives of all 14 MV seamen of Indian nationality. For his intrepid leadership and bravery, Lt Cdr Neeraj Kumar is awarded Nao Sena Medal (Gallantry).

In the wee hours of 18 May 16, Indian Air Force received a frantic call from Sri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board informing a forest fire raging on Trikuta hill which was fast approaching the shrine. Squadron Leader SS Multani (Now Wing Commander) was immediately tasked for dousing the fire by the use of Bambi bucket. He immediately swung into action and got airborne for the site. By then, the fire had turned into an inferno and was only 100m from the main walkway to the shrine, endangering the lives of thousands of pilgrims. The fire was spotted on a steep slope surrounded by tall trees making it inaccessible to the fire fighters on ground. Realising the time criticality, with his experience and awareness of the area, he identified the reservoir of Salal Dam at Riasi as a potential source for filling up water. Reduced visibility due to smoke, excessive turbulence and limited turn radius reduced any margin of error as the aircraft had to be operated at its maximum capacity. The alignment of the fire line required the water drop to be carried out in a direction facing into the hill, making it dangerously difficult unlike other fire fighting operations. With the Bambi bucket under slung at 30 m below the aircraft, the terrain clearance was marginal. The complexity of the mission required courage and skillful handling of the helicopter maintaining a high degree of situational awareness. 
 During the process of dousing the fire the bunch cable holding the Bambi bucket had entangled, thereby making it impossible to fill up the water. Returning to base for rectification would have caused loss of precious time thereby, allowing the fire to spread putting in danger lives of thousands of pilgrims. Sqn Ldr Multani located a restricted but clear patch next to the reservoir and with no assistance available on ground to secure the Bambi, he deftly manoeuvered the aircraft to land safely. Having removed the entanglement personally, he resumed  the fire fighting operations with courage and commitment. Accurate and  relentless operations were able to douse the fire, preventing a major  catastrophe in the Trikuta hills. 
 For this act of exceptional courage in saving precious lives, Wing Commander Sukhwinder Singh Multani has been awarded Vayu Sena Medal  for Gallantry.

 On 01 Jun 16, Squadron Leader Rijul Sharma was authorised to fly an Air Test sortie on MiG 29 aircraft which involved testing of aircraft at Supersonic Speeds at a height of 10 Km. While conducting this test in Supersonic Flying corridor; 110 km away from base at a speed of 1.1 Mach which corresponds to 1200-1300 Kmph of true air speed, the canopy perspex of the aircraft shattered. This resulted in explosive decompression and perspex pieces hitting the officer on his right shoulder. In the absence of canopy; he was exposed to  extremely low temperatures of minus 28 deg C and very severe wind blast owing to very high speed. Human exposure to such low temperatures, aero-medical problems of decompression sickness and few seconds to useful consciousness due to Hypoxia required prompt actions on the part of the pilot. Weighing against the option of ejecting and displaying courage of an exceptional order, Sqn Ldr Sharma decided to recover the aircraft. 
 
In the process, he totally disregarded his critical shoulder injury and the discomfort posed by high speed, high altitude and low temperatures. To avoid the effects of aero-medical problems he quickly descended to 3 Km and simultaneously reduced speed for effective control of the aircraft. Displaying concern to other lives and national assets he avoided flying close to oil installations which were enroute and populated areas. Notwithstanding the reduced frontal visibility, very high cockpit noise level and heavy aircraft weight, he skillfully handled the damaged aircraft and executed a safe emergency landing, without any further damage to the aircraft. His actions in handling such a critical emergency, not only saved his own life and the aircraft, but also prevented possible catastrophic damage to en-route strategically important and vital petro­chemical installations and populated areas.
 
Squadron Leader Rijul Sharma has been awarded Vayu Sena Medal for Gallantry.

 On 12 Mar 2016, Sqn Ldr Vikas Puri was detailed to fly a Mi-17 helicopter from Shillong to Tezpur with AOC-in-C, HQ EAC and other senior officials of his entourage on board. After an uneventful flight of 30 minutes,  his aircraft experienced fuel booster pump failure which immediately  leads to ""rarest of the rare"" emergency of ""both engine failure"" in Mi-17 helicopter. Being at a height of only 4000 feet above in a difficult terrain and with very limited time in hand, he promptly analysed the situation and quickly initiated correct recovery actions. Unaware of the actual cause of failure, displaying exceptional courage, astute technical knowledge, exceptional crew coordination, timely ingenious actions and adept handling of the toughest emergency in a helicopter, he recovered the aircraft safely by force landing the aircraft. Even while losing height critically, he maintained his composure and dexterously manoeuvred the helicopter to safety barely 250 meter above ground level thereby averting a certain catastrophe. In this fearless and courageous effort, he not only saved sixteen invaluable lives but also a precious war waging asset.
 
 He showed exemplary valour, bravery, maturity, exceptional professionalism and situational awareness in tackling one of the gravest emergency in a Mi-17 helicopter.  Squadron Leader Vikas Puri has been awarded Vayu Sena Medal for Gallantry.

On 11 Jul 16, Sqn Ldr Ramesh Verma was authorised for a battle inoculation mission, by Dark Night. While carrying out the attack profile, the front canopy of the aircraft burst with a loud bang. Sqn Ldr Verma was hit by large pieces of canopy Perspex with great force on his neck, resulting in deep wounds and injury to his right shoulder. The severe wind blast also caused his head to hit the canopy combing, almost rendering him unconscious. Sqn Ldr Verma was quick to regain control of the aircraft using his instincts. His vision had become hazy due to the strong blast of wind and possible fine powder from the bursting canopy fragments, in his eye. There was also no communication possible either with his rear seat WSO (who was not a pilot), or with any ground agency. The aircraft was very close to Bareilly town and an ejection would have resulted in catastrophic damage on ground.
 
Despite a bleeding wound, pain and stiffness in his right shoulder, he lowered his seat, selected the dark visor down and initiated recovery keeping clear of populated area. Lowering of the dark visor was essential to protect his eyes, though it considerably reduced visibility on a dark night. Large pieces of the canopy had also fallen inside the cockpit and could have interfered with the flying controls and the ejection seat. Abandoning the crippled aircraft would have resulted in extensive damage on ground and the loss of a very expensive aircraft. He displayed courage of an exceptional order in deciding to brave the strong air blast inside the cockpit, very hazy vision and grave injuries to his shoulder and arm while recovering the aircraft in a dark night. The courage, resolve, and professional skill displayed by the officer were of the highest order.
 
Squadron Leader Ramesh Verma has been awarded Vayu Sena Medal for Gallantry.

The Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas and Airborne Early Warning &  Control System (AEW&C) developed by DRDO will fly-past for the first  time during the Republic Day Parade 2017. Representing India’s stride  in indigenous Defence Technologies, the DRDO contingent this year  consists of the 155 mm/52 Calibre Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System  (ATAGS) and Arudhra- the Medium Power Radar. 

Tejas is indigenously developed by Aeronautical Development Agency, an  autonomous society of DRDO and produced by Hindustan Aeronautics  Limited. It is a light-weight and multirole four plus generation  tactical fighter aircraft which can carry laser guided bombs and modern  missiles to cause extreme damage to the target. Tejas has been inducted  into 45th Squadron of Indian Air Force. It is a move towards  self-reliance in ‘Air Power’ requirement of the nation. Tejas is the  pride of the country and a step towards “Make in India” initiative. 

The Airborne Early Warning & Control System (AEW&C) is an ‘Eye  in the Sky’. It is a force multiplier, developed by DRDO for IAF with  Centre for Air Borne Systems (CABS) as nodal agency. AEW&C system  consists of multiple sensors for Surveillance and Signal Intelligence.  It helps in Air Defence operations and is capable of communicating using  VHF, UHF, C-Band and SATCOM links for Network Centric Operations.  Induction of AEW&C into services will make the country self-reliant  and position India in top five countries having this capability. 

The Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS) is an indigenous weapon  system developed by DRDO under Prime Minister’s ‘Make in India’  initiative. Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE); a  Pune based premiere R&D establishment of DRDO is the nodal agency  for design and development of ATAGS with industry partners namely Bharat  Forge Limited and Tata Power SED.  ATAGS has excellent accuracy,  consistency, mobility, reliability and automation and is capable of  achieving 47 plus km range. The armament system of the ATAGS which  comprises 52 calibre Gun Barrel with Breech Mechanism, Muzzle Brake and  Recoil System has been designed and developed to fire the 155 mm calibre  ammunitions held by Army with enhanced range, accuracy and precision as  well as greater fire power. The system is configured with All Electric  Drive technology for the first time in the world that will ensure  maintenance free and reliable operation over longer periods of time. 

Medium Power Radar - Arudhra has been indigenously developed by  Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE), Bengaluru, an  establishment of DRDO. Arudhra is the first indigenous rotating active  phased array multi-function radar with Digital Beam forming technology.  The radar covers 360 degree in azimuth and is capable of performing  volumetric surveillance to detect and track aerial targets up to 400 km  in range and 30 km altitude. This radar can survive intense ECM  environment and electromagnetic interference. It is integrated with  modern identification of Friend or Foe system to recognize enemy targets  and is transportable by road, rail and Air.	

DRDO has a mission to empower India with self-reliance in defence  technologies.  Since its creation in 1958, DRDO’s research, design and development  efforts have led to the production of hundreds of products that include  state-of-the-art weapons, platforms, equipment and life support systems  for the Indian armed forces. Today, the production value of systems  (excluding the strategic systems) already inducted or approved for  induction, exceeds Rupees Two lakh sixty thousand crores. The strategic  systems developed by DRDO have given our country the much needed  multi-level strategic deterrence.

                This  year Republic Day Parade on Rajpath will witness tableaux from 17  States and Six Ministries of the Central Government. These tableaux will  showcase varied themes starting from country’s rich cultural heritage  and socio-economic development to nation’s progress in key areas like  IT, Women, Empowerment and Environment Protection. A brief write-up on  each tableaux highlighting its significance is given below: 
ODISHA
Dola Jatra
 
The tableau of Odisha depicts ‘Dola Jatra’ – a popular festival celebrated in the state.  This festival signifies the journey of Goddess Radha & Lord Krishna for ultimate union in the tradition of Bhakti cult.
 
‘Dola  Jatra’ coincides with the Holi festival that takes place on Falguna  Dashami before full moon day in the midst of February-March. The worship  of Goddess Radha and Lord Krishna is the pivotal event during this  six-day long festival. On Falguna Dashami, the idols of village deities,  especially that of Lord Krishna, are carried on a small decorated  wooden temple called Bimana in a procession to all houses in the  village. The procession of people, smeared with Abira (violet coloured  powder), moves from one house to another while rejoicing and dancing  with the traditional music and songs.  
 
ARUNACHAL PRADESH
Yak Dance
 
The  tableau depicts the Yak Dance, one of the most famous pantomimes of the  Mahayana sect of Buddhist Tribes of Arunachal Pradesh.  The  masked dancer represents the members of a family who are said to have  discovered the Yak with the help of a magical bird hundreds of years  ago. The Yak is the most useful animal of these tribes owing its  multipurpose uses. The discovery of the Yak resolved the family’s  internal property disputes and provided a permanent source of prosperity  to the entire community.  This  dance portrays the joy of the people upon finding the Yak and it  signifies the presence of health, wealth and happiness of the Mahayana  Buddhist tribes, who believe that performing this dance would relieve  them of all their complications and anxieties.
 
MAHARASHTRA
Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak
 
This  year is being commemorated as the 160th birth anniversary of the  honoured freedom fighter, Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak. Known popularly  as Lokmanaya, meaning revered by the people, Tilak was one of the first  leaders of the Indian Independence movement. A freedom activist and a  social reformer, he was also a mathematician, news reporter, editor,  writer and orator. He committed himself to bring about awakening in the  society and nation building so as to liberate India from the oppressive  rule of the British. He started publishing his newspapers, the  ‘Mahratta’ and ‘Kesari’.  With a  view to bring about social awakening and unity in the fight against the  foreign rule, he initiated the celebrations of ‘Ganeshotsav’ and also  the ‘Shivjayanti Utsav’. This year the tradition of celebrating  Ganeshotsav as begun by him would be completing 125 successful years.

Lai Haraoba

                INS Vikramaditya, the largest warship and latest aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy, has a strength of over 1500 personnel. A versatile national capability and a full-fledged township by herself, the ship has a new acquisition – an ATM machine installed onboard by the nation’s largest bank and banking network, the State Bank of India. The one-of-a-kind ATM machine was inaugurated onboard at a function at the Naval Base Karwar on 21 Jan 17, jointly by Rear Admiral KJ Kumar, Flag Officer Commanding, Karnataka Naval Area and Shri Rajnish Kumar, Managing Director and Group Executive (National Banking Group), State Bank of India.
 
The facilities offered by the State Bank of India to the ship include cash withdrawals, generation of mini-statements, access to bank balance details and change of PIN numbers. In the near future, the facility will be upgraded to a recycler machine with a cash deposit facility. Additionally, facilities like cash transfer, Card-to-Card transfer, Credit Card payment, mobile number registration and updation would also be available. The Indian Navy has a Memorandum of Understanding with the State Bank of India that operates Defence Salary Packages. This joint venture between India’s largest warship and largest banking network is a significant step towards cementing the partnership between the Navy and the bank further, underlines the mutually supportive relations the two organisations share. The ATM machine is a unique floating banking system, and along with the Point of Sale machine that is also proposed to be installed onboard, would go a long way in supporting cashless transactions on the ship, in line with the government’s policy of digitising the India economy. 
 
Speaking on the occasion, Captain Krishna Swaminathan, Commanding Officer of INS Vikramaditya stated that the ATM machine will add to the variety of other facilities and amenities available to the crew. It will enable personnel of the ship to manage their domestic financial requirements better and assist them in conducting their money transactions at their own convenience. Shri Rajnish Kumar, MD, mentioned the glorious achievements and history of the Indian Navy as well as the SBI. He said the two institutions are symbols of national achievement and this inauguration would extend the digital footprint of the country nautical miles beyond Indian shores. RAdm KJ Kumar said it was a matter of pride for Navy to be associated with the largest Indian bank and that this event would take the partnership between the two many notches higher. He also expected the relationship between the two to grow from strength to strength in the years ahead. 
 
Smt. Rajni Mishra, CGM (Bangalore Circle), Mr. SM Farooque Shahab, CGM and Shri Y Vijay Kumar, GM of the SBI were also present during the function.

                 In view of the fly-past at heights varying from 60 to 500 metres and the associated flight safety concerns posted by birds, the IAF appeals to all citizens of Delhi and its neighbourhood to keep their areas clean and avoid throwing eatables, garbage, dead animals or carcasses in the open in all the days leading upto 26 January.
Responsible citizens are also requested to alert the nearest Air Force Unit or Police Station and report instances of carcasses found in the open. The vulnerable areas that come in the route include Palam, Najafgarh drains, Tihar Jail, War Cemetery and areas adjoining Rashtrapati Bhawan.
Birds pose a serious threat to aircraft flying at low level. Eatables thrown out in the open attract birds, to ensure a safe fly-past, the citizens of Delhi and its neighbourhood are requested not to throw eatables and garbage in the open. Also, if they find any carcass out in the open they are requested to report to the nearest Air Force Unit/ Police Station to arrange for its prompt disposal.

Defence Minister  Shri Manohar Parrikar visited DRDO’s Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex  during his visit to Hyderabad today. He visited the integration centre  at Research Centre Imarat (RCI) and reviewed ongoing missile  technologies and related Programmes. Dr S. Christopher, Secretary,  DD&D and Chairman DRDO alongwith Dr G. Satheesh Reddy, SA to RM and  Director General, Missiles and Strategic Systems briefed the Defence  Minister on various technological developments. 
Shri Parrikar  congratulated all DRDO scientists for the recent successful missions  including Smart Anti Airfield Weapon, Long Range Ballistic Missiles Agni  V& Agni IV, Guided Pinaka and Astra. He complimented the Missile  Complex for indigenizing various technology products and strengthening  the defence industrial base in the country. 
The Defence  Minister said, “There is lot of knowledge and infrastructure base with  the DRDO and the same needs to be tapped by the MSME and private  industries, which in turn will lead towards the establishment of a  self-reliant defence industrial ecosystem in our country. Today, the  industries are significantly contributing in the realization of various  defence products with the know-how provided by the DRDO and few of them  have even graduated as lead integrators. The partnership between the  DRDO and industries is transforming our country into a global defence  manufacturing hub. This synergy has provided the much needed thrust for  exporting our defence products globally. We are taking necessary  initiatives in this direction and I am sure that our state-of-the-art  Missiles and Weapon systems will garner the much needed interest in the  global markets and generate foreign exchange.”  
Shri Parrikar  added, “I admire the initiatives taken by the DRDO in signing MoUs with  various Universities in diversified research areas and these initiatives  need to be further strengthened by frequent interactions for  realization of futuristic technological products.”

As part  of Operation SADBHAVANA, a National Integration Tour comprising of 20  school students from various schools of Imphal, West District of Manipur  interacted with General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff today. The  Chief shared his experiences while serving in these areas with the  students and motivated them to work hard and contribute actively to the  Nation Building process. He inspired them to join the Indian Army, do  well and serve the cause of the Nation. The Chief made all children  understand the importance of peace and inspired children that they must  spread the message and ensure that peace returns. 

The tour was flagged off from Imphal on 5th of January. During the  course of their tour, the participants visited various cultural and  historical places in Delhi and Agra. The participants had the honour to  meet the Hon’ble President of India on 14th January. The Children also  met the Human Resource Development Minister on 10th January.

On Army Day, Indian Army
Celebrates being Instrument of National Power
 
 
Indian Army celebrated its 69th Army Day today. General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff reviewed the Army Day Parade at the Cariappa Parade Ground, Delhi Cantonment and awarded fifteen Sena Medals (including five posthumously) for individual acts of Gallantry and fourteen COAS Unit Citations for commendable performance of their respective units. 
 
          Every year Indian Army celebrates 15th January as ‘Army Day’ to commemorate the day when General (later Field Marshal) K.M Carriappa took over the command of Army from General Sir F.R.R Bucher, the last British Commander-in-Chief in 1949 and became the first Commander-in-Chief of Indian Army post Independence.
 
General Bipin Rawat, in his address stated that while India sought peace on Line of Control, Cease Fire Violations or untoward incidents propagated by Pakistan will be responded to by force. He also brought out that Confidence Building Measures were being further strengthened along the Line of Actual Control with China to reduce tensions. The COAS  highlighted contribution of Indian Army in UN Peace Keeping Missions, modernization projects in the pipeline and welfare schemes being instituted for serving soldiers, ex servicemen and veer naris. He  reinforced the point that redressal of individual grievances by serving personnel should be carried out through established mechanisms within Army rather than resorting to platform of social media for the same.
 
       
 
 The parade was commanded by Maj Gen Rajesh Sahai, Chief of Staff, Delhi Area.  The leading contingent of the parade was formed of the recipients of the Param Vir Chakra, Ashok Chakra Awardees and International Sports Awardees. This was followed by Army contingents which included T-90 Tank BHISHMA, Infantry Combat Vehicle BMP II, Brahmos Missile System,  Weapon Locating Radar (SWATHI), Akash Missile System, CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological & Nuclear) Reconnaissance Vehicle, Mobile transportable satellite terminal vehicle and seven marching contingents including mounted horse cavalry. 
 
        The Veterans Tableaux, organized by the Directorate of Indian Army Veterans, depicted their role and contributions towards the nation. A motorcycle display by “SHWET ASHW” team of the Army Corps of Military Police was the other attraction during the parade. A Paramotors display was also carried out by a team from the 50 (I) Para Brigade.
 
       The grand finale was a combat demonstration, which showcased combat techniques of the Army sub units. Combat actions included strafing runs depicted by armed helicopter, combat manoeuvres by tracked combat vehicles and special operations including  air insertion and extrication of soldiers behind enemy lines.  
 
         The Indian Army is regarded as one of the most credible institutions and Instrument of National Power. Indian Army operates in the most inhospitable conditions with resolve and pride. It has acquitted itself extremely creditably in internal security and counter-insurgency operations and has extended invaluable aid to civil authorities in disaster management and maintenance of law and order.
 
        Earlier in the day, wreaths were laid at Amar Jawan Jyoti, India Gate by the three Service Chiefs to commemorate the Army Day.

                Submarine ‘Khanderi’ Launched 
 
Khanderi, the second of Indian Navy’s Scorpene’ class  stealth submarine, was ‘launched’ today by the Hon’ble Raksha Rajya  Mantri, Dr Subhash Bhamre paving the way for her sea trials. Admiral  Sunil Lanba, Chief of the Naval Staff and a host of other dignitaries  witnessed the launch at Mazagon Dock Shipyard Limited today.
The submarine is expected to be delivered to Navy by the  year end. She has been christened after her illustrious predecessor, an  erstwhile ‘Foxtrot’ class submarine decommissioned in 1989, which is as  per the traditions of Indian Navy. The construction of six Scorpene  submarines is presently being progressed at Mazagon Dock Shipyard  Limited (MDL), under Project 75 with Transfer of Technology from M/s  DCNS, France as the Collaborator. The first of the class submarine,  Kalvari is presently undergoing sea trials and likely to be commissioned  into Navy by Mid 2017. These submarines, post induction, would form the  core of Navy’s conventional Submarine Arm.
Speaking on the occasion Dr Subhash Bhamre said that  Project 75 Kalvari is a key milestone in self reliance and  indigenisation for the country. Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chief of the Naval  Staff said during his address that the fact that Submarine ‘’Khanderi” compares  with the best in the world, speaks highly of the experience and  expertise our shipbuilders have gained over the years. He added that as  Indian Navy celebrates Golden Jubilee of the submarine arm in 2017, the  induction of Project 75 submarines would mark the beginning of a new chapter in our submarine capabilities.
                                               
The launching of Khanderi also marks a critical milestone  event for the Shipyard which earlier has delivered two Shishumar class  submarines in the 90’s and has now strengthened its position as a  submarine building yard for Indian Navy. Started as a small dry dock  facility for East India Company, MDL today has established itself as a  forefront Defence Public Sector Undertaking, with indigenous  construction of several ships and submarines for Navy such as P 15 B  Destroyers and P 17 A class stealth Frigates being the latest.

While  continuing these pursuits the current year will concentrate on ‘field  focus’ which is the theme for this year’s camp, he said.

Defence  Minister Shri Manohar Parrikar appreciated the efforts of Directorate  General Defence Estates (DGDE) in translating the concept of Swachh  Bharat campaign into reality. Addressing a press conference, here today  on the successful conclusion of Swachhta Pakhwada in the cantonments  under the aegis of DGDE, the Minister said during the pakhwada,  DGDE has managed to dispose of nearly 10,800 MT of garbage through  Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) from their cantonments which is itself an  achievement. On this occasion, the Minister also released a booklet on  the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in cantonments’ during the pakhwada. 
 
In  his welcome address, Additional DGDE Shri P Daniel gave a presentation  on the activities of its 62 notified cantonments in the successful  implementation of the Swachhta Pakhwada, which was observed from 01 to  15 December 2016 all over India. He said cantonment boards are now  trying to introduce Solid Waste Management System in their areas on the  lines of the system being operated in Goa. The boards have also  introduced modern bio-digester toilets developed by DRDO and all efforts  are on to declare all cantonments as ‘Open Defecation Free’ as per  guidelines of the Ministry of Urban Development 
 
Shri  Daniel further said that after checking, it was confirmed that no  insanitary latrines were found in any cantonment and 171 toilets were  attended to during the pakhwada. He also mentioned that  approximately 762 kms of drains and sewers were cleaned, intensive  cleaning of roads and trimming of roadside trees and management of  trenching ground were executed during the exercise.  To  create more awareness about the Swachhta campaign, DGDE has now decided  that such activities will be carried out periodically by cantonment  boards under the motto ‘Swachh Chhavni Swasth Chhavni’,  to sustain the momentum of the Swachh Bharat Campaign. The message of  the campaign will also be spread through a Mini Marathon and a  drawing/painting competition, which will be organised by all cantonments  on 15 and 22 January 2017 as part of the Republic Day celebrations, he  added.
 
The  function was attended by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash  Bhamre, Secretary (Defence Production) Shri AK Gupta, Secretary  (Ex-Servicemen Welfare) Shri Prabhu Dayal Meena, Director General  Defence Estates Shri Jojneswar Sharma and Addl Secretary (MoD) Shri JRK  Rao.

Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North  Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions,  Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said here today that the  focus with which the Ministry of DoNER under the Union Government led by  the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has launched a series of new  initiatives over the last two years, the day is not far when the  Northeast Region (NER) will develop as the favourite 'youth destination'  for youngsters. 

Dr Jitendra Singh was addressing a gathering of students, as chief  guest, at an Inter-College ""Northeast"" cultural event, in which around  25 colleges of Delhi University participated in different categories.  Referring to the large number of Northeast student community in the  national capital and other metros, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the  earlier decades, the Northeast did not receive the kind of attention it  deserved, as a result of which there has been an exodus from the region  to the other parts of India. The primary reason behind this, he  observed, is lack of employment opportunities and deficit of quality  education. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, on the one hand, the Northeast has a huge  natural resource which has remained unexplored and on the other hand,  there is huge youth potential which has remained unutilized. He said,  the Organic Farming Mission focusing primarily on Northeast and the  thrust on other areas like bamboo trade, etc. will help in creating job  avenues. 

Dr Jitendra Singh referred to special impetus given by the Ministry of  DoNER to Prime Minister’s “Startup India, Standup India” by introducing  Venture Capital Fund for those young startups who wish to start an  establishment or entrepreneurship in Northeast. If this succeeds,  startups from all over India will make a beeline for Northeast India, he  added.  

Referring to some, first of its kind initiatives, Dr Jitendra Singh  mentioned the decision to set up a Sports University considering the  high athletic potential of the youth and also the Brahmaputra Study  Centre in the Guwahati University. He said, Delhi has been enriched by  some of the best faculty hailing from Northeast and appealed them to go  back to their State of origin and serve the cause of academics. 

Earlier, Principal of Daulat Ram College, Dr Savita Roy delivered the  welcome address. The programme was attended by senior faculty members  from Delhi University and students from different colleges.

Addressing the inaugural session at the two-day  International Symposium on Medicinal and Aromatic plants of India here  today, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development  of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances  & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that  lifestyle diseases like Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 require holistic  management and with more than 65% to 70% of India’s population today  being less than 40 years of age, Diabetes and heart attack in young are  going to be the main challenges ahead, because these tend to affect the  youth potential which is imperative in the task of nation building.
Dr Jitendra Singh referred to the change of disease  spectrum of India over the last few decades and said that India today  has evolved from an era of communicable diseases into an era of  non-communicable diseases like Diabetes Mellitus, heart attack, lipid  disorders, hypertension and other metabolic diseases. Even though a  number of new remedies and medicinal options are available for the  treatment of these diseases, he said, the basic Mantra is still based on  lifestyle modifications and natural methods, and for this purpose, the  various Indian medicine regimens incorporated in Naturopathy, Yoga and  other indigenous therapies find a contributory role, he added.
Under the leadership of the Prime Minister Shri  Narendra Modi, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the last two years, not only  the holistic medicine and the indigenous therapies have been accorded  priority but have also been given a place of respectability. He said  that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi decided to establish the  first ever independent Ministry of AYUSH in the Government of India  after nearly 70 years of independence. Similarly, it was again Prime  Minister Shri Narendra Modi on whose proposal the United Nations  unanimously accepted to observe International Yoga Day on 21st June, he  added.
India is the fountain- head and original birth-place  of all the aromatic and medicinal plants, said Dr Jitendra Singh and  regretted that in the last few decades, most of the research on the  Indian medicinal plants was conducted in other countries and not in  India. To that extent, he said, the Central Government has tried to  vindicate the lapse of the earlier decades.
While emphasizing on indigenous research based on  Indian conditions, Dr Jitendra Singh also called for change of mindset,  so that those who choose to become practitioners of Indian medicine,  should do so by aptitude and interest.
Dr Jitendra Singh said that the North East region of  India has huge potential for the organic products which have huge  health benefits. This unexplored potential needs to be explored, he  added. He also said that Government is giving priority to tap this  potential of the North East region as well as placing high priority on  the health status of the citizens. This will be helpful in tapping the  natural organic resources for the health benefit of the citizens, he  added.
MoS Agriculture Shri Parshottam Rupala, while  speaking on the occasion said that the Ministry of Agriculture will  evolve a more comprehensive plan to promote medicinal plants and herbs  and will also try to take the experts on board. 
 Member of Parliament, Shri Manoj Tiwari, MLA of  Delhi Shri O. P. Sharma and Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH, Shri Ajit  Sharan were also present on the occasion.

                The  Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North  Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions,  Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh discussed here today the  tourism promotion plans for Shillong and other surrounding areas of  Northeast with a group of professionals led by Member of Parliament from  Tura, Meghalaya, Shri Conrad K. Sangma. 
The  Minister was given an audio-visual presentation about the roadmap  conceived for placing Shillong as a tourist attraction on global  platform and thereby also promoting the entire region through a similar  strategy. The presentation highlighted the various options and  itineraries with focus on a 3-day holiday capsule incorporating cultural  activities, meditation centres, music workshops, experience of food  cuisines and trekking options. 
Dr  Jitendra Singh said there is no second opinion about the fact that  Shillong has not received the kind of tourism attention as it deserves.  This, he said, is an irony considering the fact that Shillong is the  original capital of Northeast right from the days of British Empire to  the post-Independence era of undivided Assam State. However, he said,  the Central Government has done its best to fast-track and make up for  the undone initiatives of the past. 
Dr  Jitendra Singh also disclosed that, with a view to make the Shillong  Airport fully functional with wider utility, the Ministry of DoNER has  offered to fund the budget required for extension of the air-strip. At  the same time, he said, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has also been  approached to extend the facility at the airport and at the same time,  increase the number of chopper / helicopter flights. 
Some of the music groups from Meghalaya can also be made part of the tourism bonanza capsule, he said. 
Dr  Jitendra Singh also referred to the practice of ""home-stay"" tourism  which has caught up in a big way in Shillong and surrounding areas, and  said, this is a practice which is worth emulating by other tourist  destinations of the country as well.

The Union Minister of  State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER),  MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and  Space, Dr Jitendra Singh addressed at the celebrations of Magh Bihu  (Makar Sankranti) festival, organised by Ministry of Development of  North-East Region (DoNER) at Dilli Haat here today. The theme of the  festival was ‘Integration through fusion’. 
 
Addressing on the  occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Bihu is the biggest post-harvest  festival of Assam and other parts of the North-East and it coincides  with the other festivals such as Pongal, Lohri and Makar Sankranti. He  wished the people on this occasion as it is the beginning of new year.  He also said that dance performances by artists symbolize the unity in  diversity of Indian culture. 
 
On the auspicious  occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh announced the setting up of multi-purpose  ""DoNER House"" complex at Guwahati, Assam. He said that it will be a  complex which will have meeting hall, conference hall and other  infrastructural support.  
 
Dr Jitendra Singh said  that the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra  Modi has taken various steps for the development of North Eastern  region. He said that earlier the emphasis was on bringing the North east  region closer to the national mainstream, but now the emphasis is being  laid on bringing the rest of India closer to the culture and diversity  of north east. The north east region is now visible in the national  capital and the celebration of such festivals in Delhi is an instance of  that, he added. He said that the development of north east has been the  priority of the Government and the wholesome growth of the nation is  not possible without the development of all regions including Northeast.  
 
He also said that the  Government has laid special emphasis on the development of  infrastructure in the north-east region. There is exclusive scheme for  road development in the north east region, he added. He also said that  air and rail connectivity is being given priority by the Government. The  connectivity will attract investments in the region which will lead to  the development of the North east. It will also encourage start ups to  come to north east, he added. He also said that the region rates high in  terms of many social indicators such as literacy and women empowerment  and there is lot to learn from it. He said that the unexplored potential  of the region needs to be explored and utilised. The Minister said that  in February, 2015, the Government started with the practice of having a  camp office in each state of north east on a rotational basis which has  helped the officers to understand the problems on the region on the  ground level. 
 
On the occasion, the  artists from Song and Drama Division of Ministry of Information and  Broadcasting presented dance performances from various states which  symbolized the rich Indian culture as well as unity in diversity. 
 
Senior officers of the Ministry were also present on the occasion.

The  Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri  ParameswaranIyer, made a one day visit to Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh, to  assess the progress of Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) in the State. He  started the day by visiting a village in Guntur district and interacting  with villagers and school children. This was followed by a meeting with  the Chief Secretary, Andhra Pradesh and other State officials. Along  with the Chief Secretary and State team, he also interacted with the  District Collectors through video conference.
The State Government apprised that a few districts in the State are  on their way to becoming open defecation free (ODF) within the next few  months. The District Collectors shared many good practices such as  emphasis on ODF achievement rather than focus only on individual  toilets, creation of district brands (such as Atmagaurav in Nellore),  deployment of Nigrani Committees in villages, engagement of natural  leaders, involvement of students, involvement of SHGs etc. It was  discussed that a mechanism may be put in place for strengthening grass  root level motivators and engaging communities more closely. An eye also  has to be kept on technology of toilets. The CEO of SERP (Society for  Elimination of Rural Poverty) also participated in the discussions and  shared views on how women SHGs can be involved more closely with Swachh  Bharat.
The Secretary also held a one to one meeting with the Chief Secretary, earlier in the day.

                The new indigenously developed payment app 'BHIM'  (Bharat Interface for Money)    has been named after the main architect of Indian constitution,    Bhim Rao Ambedkar. Through this app, Bharat Ratna Bhim Rao Ambedkar's  name will take the  centre-stage in India's economy. The day is not far, when people will conduct their business through this app.  This  app will create financial equality in the Country, as envisaged by Dr.  B.R. Ambedkar ’ said Ramesh Jigajinagi , Union Minister of State,  Ministry of Drinking water and sanitation.  
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has  been introducing many welfare Schemes for the Developments of Dalits,  backward classes and financially backward class people. Indeed, BHIM  will curb black money system and create equality in the society. It will  support them, he said.    
BHIM  is a biometric payment system app using Aadhar platform, and is based  on Unified Payment Interface (UPI) to facilitate e-payments directly  through bank. It was launched to stress on the importance of technology  and digital transactions. It can be used on all mobile devices, be it a  smartphone or a feature phone with or without internet connection, he  added.  
The  payments through the new system (BHIM App) can be made by just a thumb  impression after the bank account is linked with Aadhaar gateway. Indeed, the technology through BHIM will empower poorest of the poor, small business and the marginalised section.
Recalling  that India, once described as golden bird (Sone ki Chidiya), became  poor due to certain mistakes, Our PM’s visions to regain the Country’s  potential and its past glory once again. The Prime Minister also  appealed to the people to undertake at least five transactions daily  through mobile phones and let the country lead the digital movement.
The  new app is expected to minimise the role of plastic cards and point of  sale machines. The app will eliminate fee payments for service providers  like MasterCard and Visa, which has been a stumbling block in people  switching to digital payments.
The  app can be used to send and receive money through smartphones. Money  can also be sent to non UPI supported banks. Bank balance can also be  checked through the app. Currently Hindi and English are supported in  the app, with more languages coming soon. Indicating that the e-wallet  app will feature fingerprint verification in future, ""Only thumb will be  needed to make a payment. Thumb will be your bank now"".  People should utilize the app and support this to curb black money and to create  financial equality, he appealed.

       ii.            The Bill provides for complete autonomy to the Institutions, combined with adequate accountability. 
      iii.            Management of these Institutions would be Board driven, with the Chairperson and Director of an Institution which will be selected by the Board. 
     iv.            A greater participation of experts and alumni in the Board is amongst otherimportant features of the Bill. 
       v.            Provision has also been made for inclusion of women and members from Scheduled Castes/Tribes in the Board.  
     vi.            The Bill also provides for periodic review of the performance of Institutions by independent agencies, and placing the results of the same on public domain. 
    vii.            The Annual Report of the Institutions will be placed in the Parliament and CAG will be auditing their accounts. 
  viii.            There is also a provision of  Coordination Forum of IIMs as an advisory body.
Background:
Indian Institutes of Management are the country's premier institutions imparting best quality education in management on globally benchmarked processes of education and training in management. IIMs are recognized as world-class management Institutions and Centers of Excellence and have brought laurels to the country. All IIMs are separate autonomous bodies registered under the Societies Act.
Being societies, IIMs are not authorized to award degrees and, hence, they have been awarding Post Graduate Diploma and Fellow Programme in Management. While these awards are treated as equivalent to MBAs and Ph.D, respectively, the equivalence is not universally acceptable, especially for the Fellow Programme.

The  Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has commissioned a very high  resolution (12 km) global deterministic weather prediction model for  generating operational weather forecasts. The model has been on trial  since September 2016. It has shown significant improvements in skill of  daily weather forecasts. This model has been made operational from  January 16, 2017.  
 The present model replaces the earlier version which had a horizontal resolution of 25 km.  It was very helpful, especially in predicting the track and the intensity of the recent Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Vardah and the cold wave over the northern parts of India. 
 MoES’s  operational Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) will also be upgraded to  12 km. For this the High Performance Computing (HPC) system resources  available with MoES is to be augmented to 10 Peta Flops from the current  1.2 Peta Flops. The operational EPS currently has a horizontal  resolution of about 25 km. 
 The EPS is adopted to overcome  the problem of uncertainties in the forecasts. It involves the  generation of multiple forecasts using slightly varying initial  conditions. The EPS also help generate probabilistic forecasts and  quantify the uncertainties.
 The  Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) provides Weather, Climate and  Hydrological Services to various users round the year and 24/7. Both  operational and research aspects for these services are implemented  through its constituent units India Meteorological Department (IMD),  National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), Indian  Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and Indian National Centre for  Ocean Information System (INCOIS).
 In  general, during the last five years, the skill of weather and climate  forecasts in India has improved. The improvement is noted especially in  general public weather forecasts, monsoon forecasts, heavy rainfall  warnings and tropical cyclone warnings and alerts. The successes in  predicting the Tropical Cyclones Phailin/Hudhud, heavy rainfall  event in Chennai during December 2015, deficient rainfall during monsoon  season of 2015 are the best examples for the improvement in prediction  capability during the recent years.
 Focused  research and development activities have been carried out at IITM,  NCMRWF and IMD on weather prediction model development and data  assimilation methods. Data from the International and Indian satellites  are being assimilated in the weather prediction models. 
 The  communication of forecasts to the stake holders on time and in proper  language is very important in the effective use of weather and climate  forecasts and minimizing the loss and damages due to severe weather. IMD  has established an effective mechanism for dissemination of weather and  climate forecasts to different stake holders using different  communication channels.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has given its approval to ratify the Second Commitment Period of the  Kyoto Protocol on containing the emission of Green House Gases (GHGs).  The second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 2012.   So far, 65 countries have ratified the Second Commitment Period.
In view of the critical role played by India in securing  international consensus on climate change issues, this decision further  underlines India's leadership in the comity of nations committed to  global cause of environmental protection and climate justice.  Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by India will encourage other  developing countries also to undertake this exercise. Implementation of  Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects under this commitment period  in accordance with Suslainable Development priorities will attract some  investments in India as well.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)  seeks to stabilise Green House Gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a  level that would minimize interference with the climate system.  Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the  current high levels of Greenhouse Gas (GHGs) in the atmosphere, the  Kyoto Protocol places commitments on developed nations to undertake  mitigation targets and to provide financial resources and transfer of  technology to the developing nations. Developing countries like India  have no mandatory mitigation obligations or targets under the Kyoto  Protocol.
Background
The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 and the 1st commitment period  was from 2008-2012. At Doha in 2012, the amendments to Kyoto Protocol  for the 2nd commitment period (the Doha Amendment) were successfully  adopted for the period 2013- 2020. Developed countries have already  started implementing their commitments under the 'opt-in' provisions of  the Doha Amendment.
India has always emphasized the importance of climate actions by  developed country Parties in the pre-2020 period.  Besides, it has  advocated climate actions based on the principles and provisions of the  Convention, such as the principle of Equity and Common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR &  RC).

                The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has invited comments on the draft notification of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Dog Breeding and Marketing Rules), 2016.   The Ministry will be notifying the proposed draft Rules in the Gazette of India for public information.  Any interested person can make any suggestion on the said draft rules in writing for consideration of the Central Government to the Deputy Secretary, Animal Welfare Division, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Indira Paryavaran Bhawan, New Delhi, within 30 days of such publication of the Rules.
Interacting with mediapersons here today, Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, said that till now there were no Rules in the country on the breeding, sale and purchase of dogs.   The Minister expressed the hope that the shops and sale and purchase of dogs will be made online.
 
Objective of the Rules:
 
            The objective of the Rules is to make dog breeders and their marketers accountable and to prevent infliction of any cruelty in this process.  There were also no specific rules, or guidelines for mandatory registration of breeders and establishments and requirements to be met by such breeders. Dog breeding and their marketing trade also mushroomed all around.  At times, some cruelty has been caused in breeding and marketing of dogs, with little or no accountability.
 
Process: The proposed Rules provide as under:-
 
(i)                 It will be mandatory for all dog breeders and the dog breeding establishments to register themselves with the State Animal Welfare Board of the respective State Governments.  
(ii)               It defines the breeding requirements/conditions for sale.
(iii)             It defines the requirements to be met by the breeders and the establishments used for breeding, or housing dogs, such as health-related requirements, housing facilities, manner of housing dogs, conditions for sale, breeding, micro-chipping, vaccination etc.
(iv)             An inspector authorised by the State Board can inspect the establishment.
(v)               It is mandatory for dog breeders to maintain proper records of both male and female dogs, their breed, micro-chip number, number of litters, sale, purchase, death, rehabilitation etc.
(vi)             Every dog breeder is required to submit yearly report to the State Board regarding animals sold, traded, bartered, brokered, given away, boarded or exhibited during previous year or any other information asked for by the State Board.
 
Violation of Rules:   Non-compliance of the proposed Rules will lead to cancellation of the registration of the dog breeder.
 
The Ministry has implemented Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, 1960 to prevent infliction of unnecessary pain, or suffering on animals.

                The Passport Seva Project (PSP), an ambitious Mission Mode Project of the Government of India, is being successfully run in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode as part of the National e-Governance Plan. It has emerged as one of the most noticeable statutory and citizen-centric services being rendered by the Government. M/s Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is the Service Provider for the PSP.
At present, 89 Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) with best-in-class amenities are operating across the country as extended arms of the 38 Passport Offices, thus providing extended reach to passport applicants. Several quantitative and qualitative improvements in the delivery of passport services in the country have been made during the last two and a half years.
Over the years, there has been an expansion in the volume of passport related services. Government of India rendered 1.15 crore passport and other related services during the calendar year 2016.
The Ministry of External Affairs has engaged closely with the Police Departments across States/ Union Territories to reduce the time taken in completion of Police Verification Report (PVR) for expeditious issuance of Passports. The Department of Posts has been a valuable partner of the Ministry of External Affairs in the PSP by ensuring timely despatch and delivery of the passports from the Passport Offices to the registered address of the passport applicants.
In order to streamline, liberalize and ease the process of issue of passport, the Ministry of External Affairs has made several changes towards the end of last year in the realm of passport policy which is expected to benefit the citizens of India applying for a passport. It is expected that these changes in the Passport Rules would further ease the process for passport applicants in getting their passports.
The objective of the Government has been to cater to the demand for passports and to reach out to the people located far away from the Passport Offices. One approach has been to open PSK at various locations and under this, the Government has decided to inaugurate additional four PSK at Indore in Madhya Pradesh, Udaipur in Rajasthan, Siliguri in West Bengal and Sholapur in Maharashtra in the coming months. A second approach has been to organize Passport Seva Camps at various locations. During 2016, 80 such Camps have been organized at various locations across the country in which 34,111 passport applications were processed.
In order to extend passport services to our citizens on a larger scale and to ensure wider area coverage, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the Department of Posts (DOP) have now agreed to utilize the Head Post Offices (HPO) in the various States as Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK) for delivering passport related services to the citizens of our country. The pilot projects for this joint venture between MEA and DOP would be inaugurated on 25 January, 2017 at the HPO at Mysuru in Karnataka and at Dahod in Gujarat. Appointments for passport applicants have been released for these two places beginning 25 January, 2017. Applicants, who apply for their passports online through the passport portal, can now schedule an appointment and then visit the designated POPSK to complete the formalities akin to those at the PSK necessary prior to the issue of the passport.
Delivery of passport related services through the POPSK would be yet another citizen-centric measure of the Government in taking IT- driven public services closer to the people of the country. This partnership would be an important step forward enabling the Government to continue to deliver passport related services to the citizens in a timely, transparent, more accessible, and reliable manner through streamlined processes and a committed, trained and motivated workforce.
Once the pilot projects are operationalized successfully, the Government intends to scale up this programme by opening POPSK in all the HPO in a phased manner.

                 India Development Foundation of Overseas Indians (IDF-OI) is a not-for-profit Trust set-up by the Government of India to facilitate philanthropic contributions by Overseas Indians to social and development projects in India. IDF-OI is chaired by External Affairs Minister, Smt. Sushma Swaraj yesterday
 Presently, IDF-OI is promoting flagship programmes of Government of India- Swachh Bharat Mission and National Mission for Clean Ganga; and projects identified by the State Govts, for funding by Overseas Indians.
Working with State Governments in areas such as sanitation; education; drinking water; women’s empowerment et/c, IDF-OI is offering projects for funding by Overseas Indians. Overseas Indians can contribute as an individual, or a group of individuals or even through their respective Indian Associations.
IDF-OI does not recover any administrative cost from contributions received from Overseas Indians.
At the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention 2017 the Plenary Session I focused on The Indian Diaspora- Catalyst for Realising India’s Development on 08 January 2017, chaired by Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri M.J Akbar. The session discussed how IDF-OI can effectively enable Overseas Indians to reconnect and contribute to India’s social and development efforts. They expressed interest in working with IDF-OI and highlighted the need for credibility i.e. accountability, efficiency, and transparency in project implementation and fund utilisation.
At the conclusion of the session IDF-OI also received contributions from Overseas Indians.

His Excellency Michael Ashwin Adhin, Vice President of Suriname,
Shri Siddaramaiahji, Chief Minister of Karnataka,
Shri Vijay Goel ji, Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports,
My young friends and delegates attending the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention,
Young overseas Indians from four Know India Programmes,
Students from the National Service Scheme,
Students from colleges and universities in Bengaluru area,
It is a pleasure to be here today at the inaugural session of the Youth Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.

At the outset, I extend to all of you warm and heartfelt wishes for  happiness, peace and prosperity to all in this New Year 2017.
A  long time ago, your elders embarked on an arduous journey, uprooting  themselves from familiar surroundings, to seek their dreams. Armed only  with their belief in their abilities, they transformed the world around  them against all odds and constructed realities from dreams. 

The common thread, the indestructible filament that binds all of you  together is the enduring connect with a country whose history dates back  to five millennia, whose contemporary reality takes you on an  incredible journey and whose future offers you endless possibilities. We  consider you as one of our own and we offer you the best of what we  have.
Whether  you are looking for adventure tourism, or affordable quality education,  or tech start-ups or even a market for novel utility products, India  offers limitless opportunities. For example, Bengaluru alone is home to  many educational and research institutions such. It is also home to  several active tech startups. Similar facilities and opportunities exist  in towns and cities across the country.
To  familiarize the Diaspora youth with the limitless opportunity and  potential that is India, and to harness their imagination and  creativity, we have several programmes in place.
The  Know India Programme, through which many of you are visiting India  presently, is one such scheme aimed to give you a flavour of India and  provide a platform for interaction with policy makers; industry and  civil society. We hope that the KIP alumni will remain in touch with one  another as well as with us, including through new networking platforms.
The  Scholarship Programme for Diaspora Children enables Diaspora youth to  pursue Undergraduate courses in Indian Universities and Institutes. This  programme has recently been revamped and extended from 44 to 66  countries; and the number of scholarships has also been increased. A  portal has been set up to enable online application and processing.
Bharat  Ko Janiye (Know India) Quiz programme which Prime Minister launched for  young overseas Indians in the last PBD in 2015 in Gandhinagar was  another initiative which received tremendous response. The winners  received medals from PM during the inauguration of Pravasi Bharatiya  Kendra on Gandhiji’s birthday, October 2 this year.

The Youth Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas which we launched in 2015 was yet  another reflection of our conviction in the power of the youth Diaspora  to bring in change. The 2015 Youth PBD was about3Cs, Connect- to connect the Indian Diasporas to their motherland;Celebrate- to celebrate the pride in the history and civilization heritage of India and;Contribute- participation in transforming India.
I would like to mention in this Youth PBD 2017, about 4 Ts through which you can transform your lives as well as that of India. These are:
• Talent
• Technology
• Training
• Teamwork

The first T: Talent

By 2020, the average age in India will be 29 making it the world’s  youngest country with 64% of the population in the working age group.  The Prime Minister’s vision will make India the skill capital of the  world by 2022. Whatever your chosen field of endeavour, you will  encounter many Indians in your peer group. If you have the relevant  talent, relevant skill-set and are willing to partner with us, there is a  world of opportunity for you. Cross-fertilization of ideas can also  bring rich rewards to your host country.

Sharpening of talents or skills requires infrastructure that we can  build together as partners. Skilling is not a zero-sum-game. An increase  in competence levels and range of skills in India would contribute to  greater employment opportunities both within India and elsewhere, thanks  to linkage and multiplier effects. 

The skilling eco-system should also lead to innovation and  techno-entrepreneurship which, directly or indirectly, result in social  good. I am happy to note that the Youth PBD 2017 has a plenary session  on Start-ups and Innovation which have a social impact in India. 

The second T: Technology

Indian achievements in the field of Science and Technology need no  reiteration: From super computer to indigenous space programme; Mars  Mission to Chandrayaan; Antarctic mission to oceanographic research,  there are several stellar examples. We have always believed in  Technology with a human face. 

Knowledge-based economies know no boundaries. Today, the world is  already a digital village. With technology, we can transform lives at  the touch of a button.

From the use of networking platforms to stay connected; or social media  to disseminate information; creation of technology partnerships, there  are a zillion ways in which you can transform lives through technology.

The third T: Training

In an age of rapid technological transformation, learning is not a  one-time process with a fixed beginning and end, but a continuous flow  of constantly learning, unlearning and relearning.

We consider this as a two-way process. Knowledge multiplies when shared.  We are ready to offer training and education to you in areas where we  are good at and similarly, we will be happy to take you up on your  offers of expertise in your areas of interest. Training could also take  the shape of internships; volunteering or even philanthropy. The choice  is yours.

Living far from home as students is challenging. We must make it easier  for students to focus on excellence– whether they are Indian students  abroad, or NRI students or other foreign students in India. To help us  understand the related issues and possible solutions, the Youth PBD 2017  includes plenary sessions on issues faced by Indian students abroad and  NRI and PIO students in India. We have recently launched a platform for  online registration of Indian students abroad – it is voluntary and  will help us estimate the number of such students, map them and also  reach out to them in a more effective manner.

At the Youth PBD you will also have an opportunity to meet and interact  with the young students who have come here from all over India and  especially from colleges and universities in Bengaluru.

And finally, T: Teamwork

Global good cannot be achieved by any single country alone. Also, the  challenges that we face in the world today are too complicated to be  addressed by any single country. We need to realize this and stand  together. We need to strengthen the bridges that connect us and create  new ones. 

We have launched a number of flagship programmes to achieve our  developmental objectives. Our dream is of a prosperous, skilful,  enterprising, clean and futuristic India. The Smart Cities Mission; the  Digital India; the Skill India; the Start Up India; the Swacch Bharat  Campaign are all part of our efforts to realize that dream. We also look  at our friends and partner countries to realize that dream. Our  challenges also offer opportunities for you to be part of India’s growth  story through which you will also realize your dreams. 

I could give several reasons why India has an exciting story to offer,  but the most compelling is what you see around you for yourself. Take  the time to visit the Exhibition at the PBD convention which showcases  the flagship programmes, state governments’ initiatives; and Indian  craft and cultural bazaar. I am sure you will also enjoy the cultural  performances in the evening. I invite you to also participate in the PBD  convention tomorrow and hear the Prime Minister’s vision for the  Diaspora and this nation, and the Chief Ministers of eight states who  will address the overseas Indian community. 

We have amongst us today, the young Vice-President of Suriname, H.E Mr.  Michael Ashwin Adhin. His presence and participation at the PBD is I am  an inspiration to Diaspora youth especially those from the girmitiya  countries.

Before I conclude, let me take this opportunity, on behalf of Ministry  of External Affairs, to place my sincere gratitude to the Ministry of  Youth Affairs and Sports and the Government of Karnataka for their  support in making this event possible.

Thank You.

Opening Remarks by Gen. (Dr.) V.K. Singh (Retd.) Minister of State for External Affairs at Mid Term Press Conference on January 04, 2017:
First of all, let me take the opportunity to extend to you the New Year Greetings of the entire Ministry. Thank you for joining us for this Press Conference on the MEA’s work over the last two and a half years. As you know, the External Affairs Minister usually does a Press Conference once every year. However, given that we have crossed the mid-term of our Government, this is undoubtedly a special occasion – it is both an opportunity to reflect upon both our achievements and to take stock of our goals going forward. Though EAM, Smt Sushma Swaraj ji, could not be here herself, she conveys her New Year greetings to all of you.

Under the inspiring leadership of our EAM, over the last two and half years, the MEA has not only shown itself adept at the advancement of our foreign policy goals, but also as a caring Ministry that has set a new template for the delivery of public services. Prosperity and security are the two bookends on which we have framed our foreign policy. What we have sought across the world are partnerships of prosperity – through new synergies in our flagships programmes – from investment and infrastructure, from railways and transport, Smart Cities and Skill India, Digital India and Clean Ganga, the primary aim of our external partnerships has been the growth and development of India. Led by the Prime Minister, our Government’s efforts at engaging the Diaspora has been a true game-changer, even while we have consistently sought to go to the aid of Indians in distress abroad.

Allow me here to go into some of the key aspects of our achievements and initiatives, and then there would be time for a Q&A session.
 
I. Sampark and Samvad
As all of you know, at each of the previous press conferences, we have begun with Sampark and Samvad – the fundamental basis on which this Ministry and our Government has conducted its engagement with the world. Each year we have sought to widen the circle of friends and partners – the visits of the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, the EAM and ourselves to countries large and small have been geared to this goal. As the EAM had mentioned in her last Annual Briefing, our objective is to engage, at least at the Ministerial level, with all the 192 countries of the United Nations, and we are well on course to do so soon. 

A key part of our sustained foreign engagements have in fact been back at home - through Summits and Conferences where India has played host. As recently as October, our Chairmanship of BRICS culminated in the Annual Summit in Goa, held in conjunction with the BRICS-BIMSTEC Outreach Summit. Both were a resounding success for our diplomacy on the global stage, and this was followed by the Heart of Asia Ministerial in Amritsar, a multilateral that affirmed India’s commitment to partnering Afghanistan in its transitions. These conferences underlined the region’s aspiration for greater connectivity, a process in which India has played its due part.

Even before 2016, we had seen the IAFS-III Summit which, for the first time saw the participation of 54 African countries, which unveiled a dynamic and transformative agenda of resurgence between India and the nations of Africa. IAFS itself was preceded by two landmark Summits with the Pacific Island nations (FIPIC), one in Fiji and the second in India in Jaipur – these events were a testament to our outreach to many of the smaller nations and our willingness to build a new paradigm of South-South cooperation. In addition, the 10th Vishwa Hindi Sammelan last year in Bhopal was another landmark event, with 7000 delegates representing the largest ever participation, that strengthened our association with the Hindi speaking communities of the world.

There were other firsts too: EAM met all the Foreign Ministers of the Arab World in the new Ministerial format under the India-Arab Cooperation Forum. Rashtrapatiji’s visits to Palestine, Israel and Jordan followed by the Prime Minister’s journeys to UAE, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have rejuvenated our age old ties with West Asia and the Gulf. The landmark Chabahar trilateral agreement between India, Afghanistan and Iran promises to be a game-changer for connecting India with our extended neighborhood, including Central Asia and Russia.

As you are all aware, one of the guiding mantras of our Government in respect of foreign policy has been the principle of Neighbourhood First. In the last two years, we have seen a sustained demonstration of this principle not only when it came to formal diplomatic engagements but also at times of distress and need. Whether it was the water crisis in Maldives, or floods in Sri Lanka, or Operation Maitri – our largest disaster relief effort abroad – in Nepal after the earthquake, we have extended a helping hand to all those who needed it. The Prime Minister has travelled to almost all the countries in the region, while the EAM, my colleague and I have made journeys to all them. Many of the visits by the Prime Minister were in fact the first in many years – with Nepal after 17 years, with Sri Lanka after 28 years. The landmark Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh is merely one example of an agreement that bears the mark of history. The inauguration of the new Parliament building in Kabul and the India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam, housing projects in Jaffna, a state of the art trauma centre in Kathmandu, progress on power projects with Bhutan, practical cooperation in transit and connectivity with Bangladesh and the larger BBIN grouping, the trilateral highway and the Kaladan Multimodal Project with Myanmar, lines of credit and scholarships for many countries in the region – all are testament to the paradigm of ties that India seeks in South Asia. Of course, this is predicated on safety and security in South Asia that is important if we are to see progress and development.
All the countries of the region, barring one, have demonstrated their willingness to stand together against the menace of terrorism that could undermine their collective hopes. India too, has shown that we will not back down in the face of assaults against the security of our people, the prosperity of the region and the interests of the international community. The aim of the surgical strikes that we conducted was to convey to Pakistan that we will not countenance continued terrorism as the new normal in our relationship. Our own good faith has been amply demonstrated time and again through repeated initiatives to normalize the relationship. However, as we have often stated, talks and terror cannot go together.

Our priorities in South Asia have not distanced us from our friends and partners in other parts of the world. The steady growth in our ties, overcoming ‘the hesitations of history’ with the US, has been a matter of satisfaction as much as the consolidation of our traditional partnerships with Russia, France, the UK and EU. We continue to expand the broad range of our ties with China, particularly through people-to-people connections and the expansion of Chinese investments to India, even as we seek common ground on concerns. Outside the P-5, our partnerships with nations such as Japan and Germany have been fruitful and mutually beneficial, as has been our continued engagement with countries of Africa, Central Asia, Latin America, and Central Europe. The conversion of the Look East policy to Act East policy, and the establishment of a separate Mission to ASEAN and the EAS, has reinvigorated our ties with the region, bringing closer the promise of an Asian Century.

Shaping the Global Agenda
Even as we have widened the ambit of sampark and samvad, India’s voice on the global stage has found new resonance – not only to support positive initiatives but to lead the way in proposing solutions of our own. From PM Modi’s first G20 Summit, where his intervention ensured that the issue of black money formed a part of the final document, India has sought new ways to articulate and advance its core interests.

With national security as a paramount interest, India has placed terror front and centre of the issues on the global stage. We were able to decisively defeat attempts at the glorification of terrorists and terrorism. India’s efforts to forge long-term and effective counter-terror cooperation with countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, US, France, Germany and others have dovetailed with the growing consensus that we have managed to build on the critically important Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. India also played a key role in revision of the High Risk Area by the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia.

India’s credible voice at the Paris COP-21 negotiations ensured the centrality of the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and our right to development without compromising on the critical need to combat climate change. Keeping our promise, on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, India deposited its instrument of ratification. On renewable energy, India has led the way, building the International Solar Alliance, and in just a year, opening the framework agreement for signature. The opening of the ISA framework agreement for signature within 41 days of finalizing the text of the agreement is a record in itself.

India’s non-proliferation credentials were confirmed with membership of the MTCR in 2016 and our joining Hague Code of Conduct, even as we continued constructive engagement with our partners for membership of the other export control regimes.
The signing of the Memorandum of Association with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in June 2016 has paved the way for India’s full-fledged membership of this key regional organization.

Even on the cultural side, India has articulated a new global consciousness. On PM Modi’s initiative, 21st June was declared as International Day of Yoga by the United Nations, a resolution co-sponsored by a record 177 nations and supported by all. Celebrated in virtually even UN member country for 2 years running, the IDY has gained unprecedented recognition, transforming India’s ancient practice into a global movement.
 
II. Diplomacy for Development
As I had mentioned at the outset, our diplomatic engagements have a direct relevance for our domestic development. One key indicator of our diplomatic success has been the increase in FDI into India. In 2014-15 alone, FDI inflows were at $45 billion, and for 2015-16 this has increased to $55 billion. Overall FDI inflows have increased more than 43% for the two-year period as against the two years preceding this Government. We have moved up in a host of other economic indicators – having been ranked the most attractive investment destination by global agencies as per Ernst & Young, and jumping 32 spots in the WEF’s global competitiveness index.

The flagship initiatives of the Government have provided the conceptual basis through which partnerships have been forged. MEA has acted as the principal facilitator and enabler, catalyzing old partnerships and incubating new ones – making the pitch for India’s market opportunities which is then carried forward by line Ministries and partner organization.

In each of the key areas of our development, our efforts have crystallized through MoUs that have been signed or commercial deals that have been struck. Allow me to give you a few illustrative examples – Infrastructure Investment funds have been launched with commitments by major economies like UAE, USA, UK and Japan, complemented by private sector arrangements. In railways and transport, the High Speed Rail project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad is well on track in addition to a number of infrastructure related projects with Japan. The world’s first ever ""masala” bond issued by HDFC and NTPC for infrastructure was listed on London Stock Exchange. 12 cities have been identified for Smart city partnerships with US, France, Germany and the UK, while sister city agreements share developments experiences. The Make in India programme has attracted global attention, whether through Japan launching a $12 billion Special Finance Facility or through tie ups with Germany’s Fraunhofer society, or through defence agreements such as between India and Russia on the joint production of Kamov 226 helicopters.
Providing gainful through imparting skills training to 400 million people over the next decade through Skill India has advanced through partnerships with countries like Canada, Japan and under the aegis of India’s GIAN programme, as has private sector partnerships in Digital India. PM Modi led new thinking on Energy Security through the Launch of International Solar alliance, while continuing to secure civil nuclear and Uranium pacts with Japan, UK, Canada, Australia and France, among others. $5.5 billion investments in major producing fields in Russia (Vankor) will also contribute over 10 mmt of crude to our energy security.

These agreements have also gone in hand in hand with measures to enhance effective investments such as the Amendment of Double Taxation Avoidance Convention with Mauritius.

III. Diaspora and Emergency Relief

The security of India has gone hand in hand with the protection and safety of Indians abroad. The welfare of our citizens, whether they are in Baghdad or Brisbane, has been the guiding priority of our Government over the last 31 months, and we have consciously placed it front and centre of our foreign policy. We have let our actions speak louder than our words ever could – in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, South Sudan and in the wider Gulf region, and Europe and the Americas. We have done so, not only based on the principle that Indians abroad must benefit from the protection of the Indian state but also on the broader notion that each human life is sacred. It is this that motivated the rescue of 1947 Foreign Nationals from 48 countries stranded in Yemen, and many foreign nationals from Nepal following the earthquake in Nepal.

At the same time, we have quietly plugged away at resolving long pending problems – the protection of unskilled and semi-skilled workers, harassment from unscrupulous employers, entrapment by devious agents, visas that are dishonoured and contracts that are cast aside – the resolution of these problems has been a matter of personal concern for the Ministry. The power of social media has bought the Government closer to many of the individual stories of anguish and distress – you are already aware of the extraordinary work the EAM continues to do on Twitter – whether it is the case of Geeta, brought back from Pakistan or Judith D’Souza from Afghanistan, she has demonstrated that the foreign ministry can in fact touch every human life. The institutional mechanisms that we have created, from e-migrate to MADAD, and recently Twitter Seva have been adopted widely and will go a long way in ensuring our Missions abroad are a home away from home.

So, for the first time in many years there is a closer integration between the overall objectives of our foreign policy and our engagement with the Diaspora community, a fact that is attested to by the Prime Minister’s outreach through community events in his visits abroad, the merger between MOIA and MEA, and the inauguration of the first ever centre for the Diaspora in India – the Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra in New Delhi. We are also preparing later this week for the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Bangalore, the culmination of a new format of continuous engagements and focused debate over the last two years. The Indian diaspora is set to scale up their contribution to the mission of remaking India through enthusiastic participation in ‘Swachh Bharat’, ‘Make in India’, ‘Skill India’ and ""Clean Ganga.’

IV. Passport Services
Let me finally talk a little about an extraordinary achievement of the Ministry over the last two and a half years – the revolution in Passport services, implemented through the Passport Seva Project. I am sure that you yourself or someone you know would have had the experience of how easy it is to acquire a passport these days. Leading the way in good governance initiatives, the MEA has proved that even the task of delivering 3.91 crore passports over 2 and half years years can be done with efficiency, marrying state-of-the-art technology with people friendly services. The Passport Seva System has emerged as India’s largest e-governance initiative synonymous with speed, accuracy and transparency. Our network of Passport Services has been extended with the setting up of 88 Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs), including an additional 11 covering all the North Eastern States.

The expansion of centres has gone hand in hand with simplifying procedures and easing access. For the first time, a five-day window is available for citizens to choose appointments of their convenience. During the last two years, most of the Police Districts have been integrated with the Passport Seva system digitally for expeditious Police Verification. We have launched a Mobile App, ‘mPassport Police’ for seamless and paperless generation of PVR. Over the past two years, 197 passport camps and 736 Melas have also been held to process large number of applications.

As you already know, citizens can now acquire a fresh passport under the normal category in a week, if their applications are accompanied by three basic documents. These three documents include copies of Aadhaar card, electoral photo identity card (EPIC) and PAN card, besides an affidavit in the prescribed format (declaration of citizenship, family details and no criminal record). We have just also announced a further liberalization in the passport rules for the benefit of the citizens.
 
Conclusion

For those of you who have been actively following our foreign policy initiatives, there can be no doubt as to what our diplomacy has achieved over the last 31 months. Whether at the bilateral, multilateral level or the public level (through the projection of India’s civilizational ethos through celebrations like the International Day of Yoga) India stands proud on the global stage today. Clearly, a new consciousness is emerging about our country, and what we stand for.

I am sure that the years ahead will see an even greater flowering of our diplomatic endeavours and even more win-win international partnerships, truly exemplifying our guiding motto of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas.

The  14th PBD Convention to held from 7 to 9 January, 2017 in Bengaluru in  partnership with Karnataka on theme ""Redefining Engagement with the  Indian Diaspora.”
 
Following is the transcript of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2017: Curtain Raiser Briefing (January 2, 2017)
Official Spokesperson, Shri Vikas Swarup:  Good evening friends and welcome to the first press briefing of 2017.  Let me take this opportunity to wish each and every one of you a very  happy and peaceful 2017. 
Today  as you know we have gathered to give you a briefing on the forthcoming  Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2017. This is going to be the first PBD to be  held under the new format about which External Affairs Minister had  briefed you in her press conferences. So we are here to tell you more  about this very important event which really marks the engagement with  the diaspora for us. 
I  have with me a very distinguished panel, Secretary Overseas Indian  Affairs and CPV, Shri Dnyaneshwar Mulay. Then I have with me  Commissioner Industrial Development from the Government of Karnataka,  Shri Gaurav Gupta and of course Mrs. Vani Rao Joint Secretary, Overseas  Indian Affairs too. 
The  way we will handle this is Secretary OIA will give you a broad  understanding of the program of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas and what we  expect from it and then Shri Gaurav Gupta will brief you on the  Bengaluru specific and rather the Karnataka specific details. After all  there is a particular reason why we chose to partner with the government  of Karnataka this time so he will brief you in greater detail on that  aspect. With that I give the floor to Shri Dnyaneshwar Mulay. 
Secretary (CPV & OIA), Shri Dnyaneshwar Mulay:  Good afternoon friends. The Ministry is organizing the 14th Pravasi  Bharatiya Divas Convention from 7 - 9 January in Bengaluru, Karnataka.  The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention is a very important platform for  engagement of the government of India and the state governments with the  overseas Indian community. PBD has been held traditionally on 9th  January every year to commemorate the return of Mahatma Gandhi as a  Pravasi from South Africa to India. 
Presently  there are nearly 3.12 crore i.e. about 31.2 million overseas Indians  settled globally, of which nearly 1.34 crore i.e. 13.4 million are  Persons of Indian Origin and 1.78 crore i.e. 17.8 million are Non  Resident Indians.  The first PBD was held in January 2003 in New Delhi. So far 13 editions  of the PBD Convention have been held, the last in Gandhinagar, Gujarat  in January 2015 which coincided with the 100th anniversary of Mahatma  Gandhi’s return from South Africa. 
The  PBD is often held in cities outside Delhi in partnership with states  which have large diaspora populations outside Delhi. PBD Conventions  have traditionally seen participation of a large number of Overseas  Indians, however the convention was becoming a repetitive event without  significant outcomes therefore the PBD format has been revamped under  the guidance of Hon’ble EAM. The Government has therefore decided that  the PBD Convention will henceforth be held once in two years. As per  this decision in 2016, ten PBD Conferences were held in New Delhi on  subjects of relevance to both overseas Indian community and the  Government of India. To each of these conferences we invited overseas  Indians who are domain experts in their respective fields, policy makers  and stakeholders in India, enabling a direct dialogue between the  overseas Indians and stakeholders in India. 
The  14th PBD Convention will be held from 7 to 9 January, 2017, in  Bengaluru in partnership with the State of Karnataka with the theme  ""Redefining Engagement with the Indian Diaspora.” We have been working  closely with the government of Karnataka and the representative here  today, to organize the event and we appreciate the cooperation and  assistance which we are receiving from the state government and various  departments which are involved on their behalf. 
I  will now run through some main program elements of the 14th PBD  Convention. First, the Youth Pravaasi Divas. On January 7, the Youth PBD  will be inaugurated by Shri Vijay Goel, Minister of State Independent  Charge for Youth Affairs and Sports and Minister of State for External  Affairs Gen V K Singh. Vice President of Surinam Mr. Michael Ashwin  Adhin who is just 36 years old, will be the Special Guest. 
Youth  PBD seeks to reconnect young overseas Indians with their Indian roots  and enhance their awareness of both contemporary India and the culture  and heritage of India. The inaugural session will be about the theme  ""Role of Diaspora Youth in the Transformation of India.” Youth PBD will  see participation of 160 Indian origin youth visiting under four of our  ""Know India” programs, 250 graduate and postgraduate students from the  National Service Scheme and 200 students from Bengaluru colleges. This  has been arranged so as to have a wider representation. 
Highlight  of the youth PBD will be sessions on start-ups and innovations which  have a social impact in India and start-up ecosystem in Karnataka. The  Karnataka government will host a cultural evening focusing on their  State’s music and dance forms. 
On  8 January, the PBD Convention will be inaugurated by the Hon’ble Prime  Minister who will deliver the keynote address. Prime Minister of  Portugal Dr. Antonio Costa will be the Chief Guest for the inaugural  function. Ministers from Malaysia Dato’ Seri S. Samy Vellu, Special  Envoy of the Government of Malaysia for Infrastructure, Dato’ Seri Dr. S  Subramaniyam, Minister of Health and Mauritius Minister Mr. Prithvi Raj  Singh Roopun will also participate in the PBD as special guests. 
The  Union Minister of HRD Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister of Culture and  Tourism Shri Mahesh Sharma, Minister of Health Shri J P Nadda, some  ministers from the state governments and several Members of Parliament  will also participate. 
This  will be followed by the Chief Minister's session. We invited all the  Chief Minister to participate as the PBD is an excellent opportunity for  them to connect with the diaspora and also showcase their respective  States. Eight Chief ministers have so far confirmed including Karnataka,  Assam, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and  Puducherry. There will be plenary sessions after lunch, the day  culminates with a cultural evening hosted by the Minister of External  Affairs to give a glimpse of India's varied forms of dance and music. 
On  January 9, i.e. the last day of the PBD convention there will be  several plenary sessions on issues which are of significance to the  Indian diaspora such as immigration to ECR countries, role of diaspora  organizations, the Indian community in the Girmitiya countries etc. The  Hon’ble President will deliver the valedictory address and confer the  prestigious Pravaasi Bhartiya Samman awards on 30 Overseas Indians in  India and abroad. From 2017 there will be 30 PBSA awards in each PBD  convention as the awards will now be granted once in two years. 
On  January 9, 2017, Indian missions and consulates all over the world will  also celebrate PBD in their respective jurisdictions with participation  of the overseas Indian community. I would like to highlight some unique  aspects of the PBD Convention this year. 
The  logo, you might have seen it already, the logo of the PBD was selected  through an open competition launched in www.mygov.in earlier this year.  We developed a portal www.pbdindia.gov.in which gives program and  highlights of the convention and is being updated regularly. Delegate  registration is also through this portal. All sessions in PBD 2017 will  be in plenary format and there will be no concurrent sessions. This has  been done to ensure good attendance in all the sessions. All sessions  will be interactive to enable a direct dialogue with the delegates  through a designated Q&A session during which Overseas Indian  delegates can convey their suggestions and comments. All sessions will  be live streamed globally. 
One  of the attractions at the PBD is an exhibition which will give an  opportunity to delegates to know more about the government's ongoing  programs and see the vast strides that the nation has taken in various  sectors and states. For the first time the PBD exhibition will have five  specific themes and zones i.e. Flagship programs of the Government of  India, Schemes and programs for NRIs and PIOs, Opportunities in states  for Business Investment Tourism, Incentives for NRIs and PIOs etc. then  Indian Handicraft and Cultural Bazaar including sale and demonstration  by artisans and finally Corporate Sector, where it will feature the  Indian corporate sector and PSUs etc. 
The  highlight of the exhibition is again a pavilion about India's top 20  social innovators which will feature 20 start-ups selected on the basis  of nationwide contest organized by the Ministry of External Affairs. The  contest which was organized on mygov portal, call for applications from  start-ups and innovators who had a social impact in India. The winner  will be awarded a certificate and cash prize of Rs. 1 lakh. There will  be a designated B2B meeting lounge in the exhibition area, this is being  done for the first time. We have launched a B2B platform online  www.pbdb2b.in through which delegates can pre-arrange meetings with each  other, exhibitors, corporate sector and government official who are  participating in the PBD. 
To  enable enhanced participation of young Indian diaspora, registration  fees for this segment have been reduced substantially. The registration  fees for group registrations have also been rationalized so that Indian  associations, Community organizations and Indian Professional  organizations abroad can participate in good numbers. Our Missions and  Consulates abroad will also celebrate PBD on 9th January. 
More  than 4000 delegates are expected to participate. We have very good  registrations so far and we are hoping that there will be more  registrations in the coming days, particularly from the overseas  participants. We look forward to welcoming diaspora groups from  Malaysia, Mauritius, UAE and Qatar which are sending groups of Overseas  Indians to the PBD. Qatar is in fact sending one of its largest  delegations of Overseas Indians to the PBD, nearly 140 persons. We look  forward to welcoming all of them at the PBD in Bengaluru. 
A  mobile app for convenience of delegates has been introduced for the  first time. The app PBD 2017 is available in Google Play and Apple App  Store and can be installed free of cost. The app will update the  delegates about program and other highlights of PBD 2017 and will give  real-time updates of the event. Coupled with the fact that the venue  will have free Wi-Fi, the app is expected to prove to be a useful tool  for delegates on the go. The app is also eco-friendly and in keeping  with technology of the day. 
We  hope that the Convention will enable the government to continue our  engagement with Overseas Indian Community, address some issues which  pertain to them, take on board their suggestions and feedback. We will  also celebrate at PBD, the achievements of the Indian diaspora and take  pride in their success. With this I would conclude my opening remarks,  if you have any questions I will be happy to take them. Thank you.

The Indian Economy has sustained a macro-economic environment of relatively lower inflation, fiscal discipline and moderate current account deficit coupled with broadly stable rupee-dollar exchange rate. The Economic Survey 2016-17 presented in the Parliament today by the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley states that such a sustenance is despite continuing global sluggishness. It says :
·         As per the advance estimates released by the Central Statistics Office, the growth rate of GDP at constant market prices for the year 2016-17 is placed at 7.1 per cent, as against 7.6 per cent in 2015-16.This estimate is based mainly on information for the first seven to eight months of the financial year. Government final consumption expenditure is the major driver of GDP growth in the current year. 
·         Fixed investment (gross fixed capital formation) to GDP ratio (at current prices) is estimated to be 26.6 per cent in 2016-17, vis-à-vis 29.3 per cent in 2015-16.
·         For 2017-18, it is expected that the growth would return to normal as the new currency notes in required quantities come back into circulation and as follow-up actions to demonetisation are taken. On balance, there is a likelihood that Indian economy may recover back to 6 ¾ per cent to 7 ½ per cent in 2017-18. 
 

Fiscal
·         Indirect taxes grew by 26.9 per cent during April-November 2016. 
·         The strong growth in revenue expenditure during April-November 2016 was boosted mainly by a 23.2 per cent increase in salaries due to the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission and a 39.5 per cent increase in the grants for creation of capital assets. 
Prices
·         The headline inflation as measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained under control for the third successive financial year. The average CPI inflation declined to 4.9 per cent in 2015-16 from 5.9 per cent in 2014-15 and stood at 4.8 per cent during April-December 2015. 
·         Inflation based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI) declined to (-) 2.5 per cent in 2015-16 from 2.0 per cent in 2014-15 and averaged 2.9 per cent during April-December 2016.
·         Inflation is repeatedly being driven by narrow group of food items, of these pulses continued to be the major contributor of food inflation. 
·         The CPI based core inflation has remained sticky in the current fiscal year averaging around 5 per cent.
Trade
·         The trend of negative export growth was reversed somewhat during 2016-17 (April-December), with exports growing at 0.7 per cent to US$ 198.8 billion. During 2016-17 (April-December) imports declined by 7.4 per cent to US$ 275.4 billion. 
·         Trade deficit declined to US$ 76.5 billion in 2016-17 (April-December) as compared to US$ 100.1 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. 
·         The current account deficit (CAD) narrowed in the first half (H1) of 2016-17 to 0.3 per cent of GDP from 1.5 per cent in H1 of 2015-16 and 1.1 per cent in 2015-16 full year. 
·         Robust inflows of foreign direct investment and net positive inflow of foreign portfolio investment were sufficient to finance CAD leading to an accretion in foreign exchange reserves in H1 of 2016-17. 
·         In H1 of 2016-17, India’s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 15.5 billion on BoP basis.
·         During 2016-17 so far, the rupee has performed better than most of the other emerging market economies.
External Debt
·         At end-September 2016, India’s external debt stock stood at US$ 484.3 billion, recording a decline of US$ 0.8 billion over the level at end-March 2016. 
·         Most of the key external debt indicators showed an improvement in September 2016 vis-à-vis March 2016. The share of short-term debt in total external debt declined to 16.8 per cent at end-September 2016 and foreign exchange reserves provided a cover of 76.8 per cent to the total external debt stock. 
·         India’s key debt indicators compare well with other indebted developing countries and India continues to be among the less vulnerable countries.
Agriculture
·         Agriculture sector is estimated to grow at 4.1 per cent in 2016-17 as opposed to 1.2 per cent in 2015-16; the higher growth in agriculture sector is not surprising as the monsoon rains were much better in the current year than the previous two years. 
·         The total area coverage under Rabi crops as on 13.01.2017 for 2016-17 is 616.2 lakh hectares which is 5.9 per cent higher than that in the corresponding week of last year.
·         The area coverage under wheat as on 13.01.2017 for 2016-17 is 7.1 percent higher than that in the corresponding week of last year. The area coverage under gram as on 13.01.2017 for 2016-17 is 10.6 percent higher than that in the corresponding week of last year.

 
 
Industry
·         Growth rate of the industrial sector is estimated to moderate to 5.2 per cent in 2016-17 from 7.4 per cent in 2015-16.During April-November 2016-17, a modest growth of 0.4 per cent has been observed in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). 

·         The eight core infrastructure supportive industries, viz. coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilizers, steel, cement and electricity registered a cumulative growth of 4.9 per cent during April-November 2016-17 as compared to 2.5 per cent during April-November 2015-16. The production of refinery products, fertilizers, steel, electricity and cement increased substantially, while the production of crude oil, natural gas fell during April-November 2016-17. Coal production attained lower growth during the same period.
·         The performance of corporate sector (Reserve Bank of India, January 2017) highlighted that the growth of sales grew by 1.9 per cent in Q2 of 2016-17 as compared to near stagnant growth of 0.1 per cent in Q1 of 2016-17. Growth in net profit registered a remarkable growth of 16.0 per cent in Q2 of 2016-17 as compared to 11.2 per cent in Q1 of 2016-17.
 
Services
·         Service sector is estimated to grow at 8.9 per cent in 2016-17, almost the same as in 2015-16. It is the significant pick-up in public administration, defence and other services, boosted by the payouts of the Seventh Pay Commission that is estimated to push up the growth in services. 
 
Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development
·         The Parliament has passed the “Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016”. The Act aims at securing and enhancing the rights and entitlements of Persons with Disabilities. The Act has proposed to increase the reservation in vacancies in government establishments from 3 per cent to 4 per cent for those persons with benchmark disability and high support needs.

The Economic Survey 2016-17 presented in Parliament today states that against the backdrop of robust macro-economic stability, the year was marked by two major domestic policy developments-the passage of the Constitutional Amendment, paving the way for implementing the transformational Goods and Services Tax (GST), and the action to demonetize the two highest denomination notes. The GST will create a common Indian market, improve tax compliance and governance, and boost investment and growth; it is also a bold new experiment in the governance of India’s cooperative federalism. 
 
The Survey Report says that demonetisation has had short-term costs but holds the potential for long-term benefits. Follow-up actions to minimize the costs and maximize the benefits include: fast, demand-driven, remonetisation; further tax reforms, including bringing land and real estate into the GST, reducing tax rates and stamp duties; and acting to allay anxieties about over-zealous tax administration. These actions would allow growth to return to trend in 2017-18, possibly making it the fastest-growing major economy in the world, following a temporary dip in 2016-17.
 
The Economic Survey 2016-17 states that the year was also marked by some tumultuous external developments. In the short-run, world GDP growth is expected to increase because of a fiscal stimulus in the United States but there are considerable risks. These include higher oil prices, and eruption of trade tensions from sharp currency movements, especially involving the Chinese yuan, and from geo-political factors. Another serious medium-term risk is an upsurge in protectionism that could affect India’s exports. 
The Survey states that the year also saw a number of legislative accomplishments in the country. In addition to the GST, the Government:
·          Overhauled the bankruptcy laws so that the “exit” problem that pervades the Indian economy--with deleterious consequences highlighted in last year’s Survey--can be addressed effectively and expeditiously;
·         Codified the institutional arrangements on monetary policy with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), to consolidate the gains from macroeconomic stability by ensuring that inflation control will be less susceptible to the whims of individuals and the caprice of governments; and
·         Solidified the legal basis for Aadhaar, to realise the long-term gains from the JAM trifecta (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile).
Beyond these headline reforms were other less-heralded but nonetheless important actions. The Government enacted a package of measures to assist the clothing sector that by virtue of being export-oriented, labour-intensive could provide a boost to employment, especially female employment. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) successfully finalized the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. By facilitating inter-operability, UPI has the potential to unleash the power of mobile phones in achieving digitalization of payments and financial inclusion, and making the “M” an integral part of “JAM.” Further FDI reform measures were implemented, allowing India to become one of the world’s largest recipients of foreign direct investment. The government has also adhered to a steady and consistent path of fiscal consolidation. 
The major short term macro-economic challenge is to re-establish private investment and exports as the major drivers of growth and reduce reliance on Government and private consumption. Addressing the Twin Balance Sheet problem—over-indebted corporates and bad-loan-encumbered public sector banks—a legacy of the years surrounding the Global Financial Crisis will be vital.
 
Looking further ahead, societal shifts at the level of ideas and narratives will be needed to overcome three long-standing meta-challenges: inefficient redistribution, ambivalence about the private sector and property rights, and improving but still-challenged state capacity. Doing so would lift an economy that is oozing with potential. In the aftermath of demonetisation, and at a time of gathering gloom about globalization, articulating and embracing those ideational shifts will be critical to ensuring that India’s sweet spot is enduring not evanescent.
 
The report says that India seems to be a demographic sweet spot with its working age population projected to grow by a third over the next three decades providing it a potential the growth boost from the demographic divided which is likely to peak within next five years. 
 
The Survey report also states that the Swachh Bharat which has the objective of ensuring safe and adequate sanitation, water security and hygiene has been a part of serious policy issue which would promote a broader fundamental right to privacy for women in the country.

The Economic Survey 2016-17 presented in the Parliament today has highlighted the need for fiscal prudence both by the Centre as well as the States in order to maintain overall fiscal health of the economy. The Economic Survey states that the Centre’s Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, was mirrored by Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRL) adopted in the States. 
As per the Economic Survey, there has been an improvement in the financial position of the States over the last few years. The average revenue deficit has been eliminated, while the average fiscal deficit was curbed to less than 3 percent of GSDP. The average debt to GSDP ratio has also fallen.
However, just because fiscal progress followed the introduction of the FRL, it doesn’t mean that the progress can be attributed entirely to FRLs. The following points are important with respect to the improvement in fiscal variables: 
       I.            The deficit reduction owes much to favorable exogenous factors (see Figure 1):
·         An acceleration of nominal GDP growth (of 6 percentage points on average after 2005) helped boost States’ revenues by about 1 percent of GSDP;
·         Increased transfers from the centre of about 1 percent of GSDP both because of the 13th Finance Commission recommendations and the surge in central government revenues;
·         Reduced interest payments of about 0.9 percent of GSDP on account of the debt restructuring package offered by the Centre; and 
·         Reduced need for spending by the States—estimated at about 1.2 percent of GDP--as the Centre took on a number of major social sector expenditures under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS).  
 
 

    
        
             
        
        
             
            
        
    


Figure 1: Decomposition of Reduction in Fiscal, Primary and Revenue Deficit before and after States’ FRL
 
I.            Desisting from splurging rather than belt-tightening was probably the real contribution of the States. Despite the revenue surge, non interest revenue expenditure rose by only 0.4 percent of GSDP. 
II.            Off-budget expenditures fell, as measured by the flow of explicit guarantees and loans to public utilities fell. 
III.            There was a sharp drop in the magnitude of forecast errors suggesting an improvement in the process of budget formation. The shortfalls between budgeted and actual own tax revenue went from an average of 5.9 percent of actuals (optimistic forecasts) before the FRL to -0.6 percent of actuals after. 
IV.            All of these positive indicators show signs of decay in later years; fiscal deficits for example are close the limit of 3 percent on average 10 years after the FRL (see Figure 2).

Economic Survey 2016-17 elaborates that as the fiscal challenges mount for the states because of the Pay Commission recommendations, and mounting payments from the UDAY bonds, there is a need to review how fiscal performance can be kept on track. Greater reliance will need to be placed on incentivizing good fiscal performance, not least because states are gradually repaying their obligations to the Centre, removing its ability to impose a hard budget constraint on them says the Economic Survey. Above all, however, incentivizing good performance by the States will require the Centre to be an exemplar of sound fiscal management itself.

                   The Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley presented the Economic Survey 2016-17 in the Parliament today. The Survey shows that our  country has been trying to solve its ‘Twin Balance Sheet’(TBS) problem – overleveraged companies and bad-loan-encumbered banks, a legacy of the boom years around the Global Financial Crisis. So far, there has been limited success. The problem has consequently continued to fester: Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of the banking system (and especially public sector banks) keep increasing, while credit and investment keep falling. Now it is time to consider a different approach – a centralised Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA) that could take charge of the largest, most difficult cases, and make politically tough decisions to reduce debt.
       As per the Survey, gross NPAs has climbed to almost 12 per cent of gross advances for public sector banks at end-September 2016. At this level, India’s NPA ratio is higher than any other major emerging market, with the exception of Russia. The consequent squeeze of banks has led them to slow credit growth to crucial sectors-especially to industry and medium and small scale enterprises (MSMEs)-to levels unseen over the past two decades. As this has occurred, growth in private and overall investment has turned negative . A decisive resolution is urgently needed before the TBS problem becomes a serious drag on growth.

The Survey reaches to the conclusion that a PARA may be necessary because 
·         Public discussion of the bad loan problem has focused on bank capital. But far more problematic is finding a way to resolve the bad debts in the first place.
·          Some debt repayment problems have been caused by diversion of funds. But the vast majority has been caused by unexpected changes in the economic environment after the Global Financial Crisis, which caused timetables, exchange rates, and growth rate assumptions to go seriously wrong.
·          This concentration creates a challenge since large cases are difficult to resolve, but also an opportunity since TBS could be overcome by solving a relatively small number of cases.
·          Restoring them to financial health will require large write-downs.
·          Among other issues, they face severe coordination problems, since large debtors have many creditors, with different interests. And they find it hard –financially and politically—to grant them sizeable debt reductions, or to take them over and sell them.
·          It increases the costs to the government since bad debts of the state banks keep rising, and increases the costs to the economy, by hindering credit, investment, and therefore growth.
·         Since, private run Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) have not been successful either in resolving bad debts, though international experience (especially that of East Asian economies) shows that a professionally run central agency with the government backing could overcome the coordination and political issues that have impeded progress over the past eight years.

                The Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley presented the Economic  Survey 2016-17 in the Parliament today. The Economic Survey states that  while economic performance has been remarkable in the aggregate, India’s  success as a federation depends on the progress of each of its  individual states. What is a reasonable standard for assessing how well  the states are doing? One intuitive metric is to see how well individual  states have done over time on two sets of indicators: economic  indicators, such as income and consumption, and health/demographic  indicators such as infant mortality rate, life expectancy, and total  fertility rate. Our analysis of these indicators begins in the 1980s,  when the structural break from the previous era of the “Hindu Growth  Rate” occurred.
The Economic Survey states that seeing only the shift in the levels  of these indicators does not give us the full picture because there is  no benchmark for relative assessment. Here, economic theory provides us a  useful metric: convergence (or unconditional convergence).  Convergence  means that a state that starts off at low performance levels on an  outcome of importance, say the level of income or consumption, should  grow relatively faster over time, improving its performance so that it  catches up with states which had better starting points.
The Economic Survey mentions that when studying real per capita GSDP  over time between 1983 and 2014 ,there has been a clear increase in  levels indicating an across-the-board improvement.  For example, between  1984 and 2014, the poorest state (Tripura, with a per capita income of  INR 11,537 in 1984 to INR 64,712 in 2014) increased its per capita GDP  5.6 fold; the median state (Himachal Pradesh) increased its income level  4.3 fold.
The Economic Survey mentions that, when convergence in real per  capita GDP is studied for the latest decade (2004-2014), it is found  that while incomes converge for provinces in China and for countries in  the world, in India, they diverge. When convergence in real per capita  consumption for states in India is studied, the same trend of divergence  is observed. Despite growing rapidly on average, there is sign of  growing regional inequality among the Indian states. This is puzzling  because the underlying forces in favor of equalization within  India—namely strong and rising movements of goods and people—are  strongly evident. This is not found to be the case in the previous  decade (1994-2004), when we see that incomes in China, India and the  world were all diverging/weakly converging.
The Economic Survey elaborates that to observe convergence, we  should see a downward sloping line – this means that the  countries/provinces/states that start off poorer subsequently grew  faster, closing the gap with more developed countries/states. The  opposite is happening in India.
The Economic Survey states that a similar trend of consumption  divergence is observed within India for the three time periods of  1983-1993, 1993-2004 and 2004-2011. All this suggests that over time,  regional income/consumption inequality in India is not narrowing despite  such gaps narrowing across countries in the world and within China. The  Indian paradox is doubly confounding: thicker international borders  that are more impervious to the equalizing flows of factors if  production lead to convergence but the supposedly porous borders within  India perpetuate spatial inequality.
The Economic Survey further states that one possible hypothesis for  seeing a regional dispersion in income and consumption is that there  might be governance traps that impede the catch-up process. And if there  are such traps, labor and capital mobility might even aggravate  underlying inequalities. But why such traps persist if competitive  federalism is forcing change upon the lagging states remains an open  question.
The Economic Survey remarks that in contrast, on health, there is  strong evidence of convergence amongst the states in the 2000s. But here  it is the international contrast that is striking. With regards to life  expectancy, the Indian states are close to where they should be given  their level of income. But that is not true of IMR (Infant Mortality  Rate), suggesting that the “mother and child” (discussed also in last  year’s Survey) bear the brunt of weaker delivery of health services.
The Economic Survey states that but what really stands out in the  international comparison is fertility (measured using Total Fertility  Rate), where we find that for their levels of development, the Indian  states have much lower levels of fertility than countries  internationally. These unusually large declines in fertility have  strong—and potentially positive—implications for India’s demographic  dividend going forward.

                Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley today presented the Economic  Survey 2016-17 in the Parliament today. The Survey suggest that on the  question of creating one economic India, technology, economics and  politics have been surging ahead. Perhaps, it is time for the laws to  catch up to further facilitate this surging internal integration.
It finds high levels of internal trade between states: India’s  internal trade-GDP ratio at about 54 percent is comparable to that in  other large countries. The extent to which the Constitutional provisions  facilitate the creation of one economic India is discussed in a final  section.
The first-ever estimates for inter-state trade flows indicate that  cross-border exchanges between firms amount to at least 54 per cent of  GDP, implying that domestic trade is significant. Both figures compare  favourably with other jurisdictions: de facto at least, India  seems well integrated internally. A more technical analysis confirms  this, finding that trade costs reduce trade by roughly the same extent  in India as in other countries.
The Survey shows that :-
•	Smaller states Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Goa trade more; the  net exporters are the manufacturing powerhouses of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat,  and Maharashtra
•	Otherwise agricultural Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are also trading  powerhouses because Gurugram and NOIDA, respectively, have become part  of the great Delhi urban agglomeration.
•	Intra-firm trade across States is surprisingly large (about 68 per  cent of inter-firm inter-state trade), and is affected by trade costs to  a greater extent than inter-firm trade.
However, there is a potential dampener on the finding that trade  in goods is high within India. The high level may be a consequence of  the current system of indirect taxes which in some important cases  perversely favours inter-state trade over intra-state trade. If true,  the GST by ironing out these oddities will normalise inter-state trade  in the country. This may reduce trade in some cases, and yet have a  positive impact on tax revenue because of improvements in compliance,  competitive enhancements and other channels.
It may be noted the Indian Constitution provides the Centre and  States considerable freedom to restrict trade and commerce; the needs of  creating one economic India were actually subordinated to the  imperatives of preserving sovereignty for the states. In practice,  courts’ interpretation of these constitutional provisions have also been  in favour of protecting the sovereignty of states over economic  integration.

                The Economic Survey 2016-17, presented today in the Parliament by the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley, stated that Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), having primary responsibility for the development and service provisioning of cities, face major and inextricably linked problems: large infrastructure deficits, inadequate finances, and poor governance capacities. Every Indian city faces serious challenges related to water and power supply, waste management, public transport, education, healthcare, safety, and pollution.
 
The analysis carried out for the Survey has found that greater service delivery is correlated with more resources, own revenue, staffing and capital spending per capita (Figure 1a,1b) Analysis indicates no clear relationship between service delivery and governance.

Figure 1a: Urban Capacities, Resources & Services             Figure 1b: Own Revenue & Services
 
 
Currently, tax revenues are not constrained by inadequate taxation powers of ULBs. One promising source is property tax. The study done for the Survey shows that property tax potential is large and can be tapped to generate additional revenue at city level. Satellite imagery can be a useful tool for improving urban governance by facilitating better property tax compliance. The study has shown that Bengaluru and Jaipur are currently collecting no more than 5-20 per cent of their respective potentials for property tax (Figure 2). 

 
Competition between States is becoming a powerful dynamic of change and progress, that dynamic must extend to competition between States and Cities and between cities. Cities that are entrusted with responsibilities, empowered with resources, and encumbered by accountability can become effective vehicles for competitive federalism and, indeed, competitive sub-federalism to be unleashed.

                Apparel and Leather & Footwear sectors are eminently suitable  for generating jobs that are formal and productive, providing  bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment and  generating exports and growth. This was stated in the Economic Survey  2016-17 presented by the Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley in the  Parliament today. The Survey adds that these sectors provide immense  opportunities for creation of jobs for the weaker sections, especially  for women, and can become vehicles for broader social transformation in  the country.
The Survey highlights the opportunity for India in this sector in  global context by saying that India has an opportunity to push exports  since rising wage levels in China has resulted in China stabilizing or  losing market share in these products. India is well positioned to take  advantage of China’s deteriorating competitiveness due to lower wage  costs in most Indian states, it adds.
The Survey also lists a number of challenges faced by these sectors.  It says that the space vacated by China is fast being taken over by  Bangladesh and Vietnam in case of apparels and Vietnam and Indonesia in  case of leather and footwear, while Indian companies struggle in face of  a set of common challenges related to logistics, labour regulations,  tax & tariff policy and disadvantages emanating from the  international trading environment compared to competitor countries.
On logistics, the Survey says that costs and time involved in  getting goods from factory to destinations are greater in India than  those for other countries. On labour costs, India’s source of  comparative advantage in this sector, also seem not to work in its  favour due to problems like regulations on minimum overtime pay, onerous  mandatory contributions that become de facto taxes for low-paid  workers in small firms that result in a 45 per cent lower disposable  salary, lack of flexibility in part-time work and high minimum wages in  some cases.
According to the Survey, in both apparel and footwear sectors, tax  and tariff policies create distortions that impede India gaining export  competitiveness. India imposes a 10 percent tariff on man-made fibers  vis- a-vis 6 percent on cotton fibres. On the other hand, domestic taxes  also favor cotton-based production rather than production based on  man-made fibers, and leather footwear rather than non leather footwear.   The global demand for apparel is moving from cotton fibre products to  manmade fibre and similarly footwear of non leather, it adds. India’s  competitors enjoy better market access by way of zero or at least lower  tariffs in the two major importing markets, namely, the United States of  America (USA) and European Community (EU), the Survey says.
Another problem faced by the leather sector highlighted by the  Survey is that despite having a large cattle population, India’s share  of cattle leather exports is low and declining due to limited  availability of cattle for slaughter in India.
The Survey suggests several measures to make these sectors globally  competitive and unlock its potential for creating new jobs and  generating growth. It recommends that there is a need to undertake  rationalization of domestic policies which are inconsistent with global  demand patterns.
.
Several measures have been initiated that form part of the package  approved by the Government for textiles and apparels in June 2016, the  Survey notes. Accordingly, textile and apparel firms will be provided a  subsidy for increasing employment, but these need to be complemented by  further actions such as the following:
•	An FTA with EU and UK in the case of apparel will offset an existing  disadvantage by India’s competitors- Bangladesh, Vietnam and Ethiopia.  In the case of leather and footwear, the FTA might give India an  advantage relative to competitors. In both cases, the incremental impact  would be positive.
•	The introduction of the GST offers an excellent opportunity to  rationalize domestic indirect taxes so that they do not discriminate in  the case of apparels against the production of clothing that uses  man-made fibers; and in the case of footwear against the production of  non-leather based footwear.
•	Third, a number of labor law reforms would encourage employment creation in these two sectors.

New estimates of labour migration in India have revealed that inter-state labor mobility is significantly higher than previous estimates. This was stated in the Economic Survey 2016-17 presented by the Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley in the Parliament today.  The study based on the analyses of new data sources and new methodologies also shows that the migration is accelerating and was particularly pronounced for females. The data sources used for the study are the 2011 Census and railway passenger traffic flows of the Ministry of Railways and new methodologies including the Cohort-based Migration Metric (CMM) .
 
The new Cohort-based Migration Metric(CMM) shows that inter-state labor mobility averaged 5-6.5 million people between 2001 and 2011, yielding an inter-state migrant population of about 60 million and an inter-district migration as high as 80 million. The first-ever estimates of internal work-related migration using railways data for the period 2011-2016 indicate an annual average flow of close to 9 million migrant people between the states. Both these estimates are significantly greater than the annual average flow of about 4 million suggested by successive Censuses and higher than previously estimated by any study.
Figure 1. Estimates of annual migrant flows based on railway traffic data

 
The second finding from this new study is that migration for work and education  is accelerating. In the period 2001-2011 the rate of growth of labour migrants nearly doubled relative to the previous decade, rising to 4.5 per cent per annum. Interestingly, the acceleration of migration was particularly pronounced for females and increased at nearly twice the rate of male migration in the 2000s. There is also a doubling of the stock of inter-state out migrants to nearly 12 million in the 20-29year old cohort alone. One plausible hypothesis for this acceleration in migration is that the rewards (in the form of prospective income and employment opportunities) have become greater than the costs and risks that migration entails. Higher growth and a multitude of economic opportunities could therefore have been the catalyst for such an acceleration of migration.
Third, and a potentially exciting finding, for which there is tentative but no conclusive evidence, is that while political borders impede the flow of people, language does not seem to be a demonstrable barrier to the flow of people. For example, a gravity model indicates that political borders depress the flows of people, reflected in the fact that migrant people flows within states are 4 times than migrant people flows across states. However, not sharing Hindi as a common language appears not to create comparable frictions to the movement of goods and people across states.
Fourth, the patterns of flows of migrants found in this study are broadly consistent with what is expected - less affluent states see more out migration migrating out while the most affluent states are the largest recipients of migrants. Figure 2 shows the strong positive relationship between the CMM scores and per capita incomes at the state level. Relatively poorer states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have high net out-migration. Seven states take positive CMM values reflecting net in-migration: Goa, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. Fifth, the costs of moving for migrants are about twice as much as they are for goods – another confirmation of popular conception. 
Figure 2. Cohort-based Migration Metric vs. Real Incomes across States

Policy actions to sustain and maximize the benefits of migration include: ensuring portability of food security benefits, providing healthcare and a basic social security framework for migrants – potentially through an inter-state self-registration process. While there do currently exist multiple schemes that have to do with migrant welfare, they are implemented at the state level, and hence require greater inter-state coordination.

The Economic Survey 2016-17, which was presented today in parliament by the Finance Minister Shri.Arun Jaitly, examines whether the effects associated with the “aid curse” and the “natural resources curse” internationally are discernible in the context of the Indian States. It calculates Redistributive Resource Transfers’ (RRT) from the Centre (between 1994 and 2015) and value of natural resources for Indian States (over 1980 and 2014) and correlates these with several economic outcomes and an index of governance 
 
Redistributive Resource Transfer or RRT to a state (from the Centre) is defined as gross devolution to the state adjusted for the respective state’s share in aggregate Gross Domestic Product(GDP). The top 10 recipients are: Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Assam.
 
Figure 1 shows the ranking of States, in 2015, in the descending order of RRT received in per capita terms and also per-capita gross devolution. The yellow and green dotted lines in figure 1 show the all-India rural and urban annualised per-capita poverty lines for 2015 respectively. Annual per capita RRT flows for all north-eastern states (except Assam) and Jammu & Kashmir have exceeded the annual per-capita consumption expenditure that defines the all-India poverty lines, especially the rural line. 

 
 
The Economic Survey 2016-17 points out that there is no evidence of a positive relationship between these transfers and various economic outcomes, including per capita consumption, GSDP growth, development of manufacturing, own tax revenue effort, and institutional quality.
 
Instead, there is a suggestive evidence of a negative relationship. For example, larger RRT flows seem to negatively affect fiscal effort (defined as the share of own tax revenue to GSDP). These trends are robust to alternative definitions of RRT. 
 
 Also, whether mineral rich states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Gujarat ,are doing well on the metrics of economic outcomes and governance is considered in the context of redistributive transfers. However, this does not reveal conclusive results and there is no evidence of a negative relationship between fiscal effort and reliance on revenue from natural resources over the period 2001-14. 
 

 
Thus, the existence of a ‘RRT curse’ and the lack thereof of a ‘natural resource curse’ in the context of Indian States implies that both the Centre and States need to act to mitigate the effects of the former and guard against the emergence, in future, of the latter.  In this context, the question is whether RRT, in future, can be linked more saliently to fiscal and governance efforts on the part of the States. 
 
The Economic Survey 2016-2017, also suggests providing a part of the RRTs or to redistribute the gains from resource use as a Universal Basic Income (UBI) directly to households in relevant states which  receive large RRT flows and are more reliant on natural resource revenues. 
 
Finally, recognizing and responding creatively to possible pathologies created by large bounties-either in the form of redistributive resources or natural resources, will be important to avoid making the errors of history.

                India needs an evolution in the underlying economic vision across the  political spectrum and further reforms are not just a matter of  overcoming vested interests that obstruct them. This was stated in the  Economic Survey 2016-17 presented in the Parliament today by the Union  Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley.
The Survey lists the some of the challenges that might impede India’s  progress. These challenges are classified by the Survey as follows:  ambivalence about property rights and the private sector, deficiencies  in State capacity, especially in delivering essential services and  inefficient redistribution.
The Survey highlights difficulties in privatizing public  enterprises, even for firms where economists have made strong arguments  that they belong in the private sector. In this context, the Survey  points towards the need to further privatize the Civil Aviation, Banking  and Fertilizer sectors.
The Survey points out that the capacity of the State in delivering  essential services such as health and education is weak due to low  capacity, with high levels of corruption, clientelism, rules and red  tape. At the level of the states, competitive populism is more in  evidence than competitive service delivery, the Survey adds. Constraints  to policy making due to strict adherence to rules and abundant caution  in bureaucratic decision-making favours status quo, the Survey cautions.
According to the Survey, redistribution by the government is far  from efficient in targeting the poor. This is intrinsic to current  programs because spending is likely to be greatest in states with better  institutions and which will therefore have fewer poor.
The Survey notes that over the past two years, the government has  made considerable progress toward reducing subsidies, especially related  to petroleum products. Technology has been the main instrument for  addressing the leakage problem and the pilots for direct benefit  transfer in fertilizer represent a very important new direction in this  regard, the Survey adds.
Noting that India has come a lo¬¬ng way in terms of economic  performance and reforms, Economic Survey 2016-17 says that there is  still a journey ahead to achieve dynamism and social justice. Completing  this journey will require broader societal shifts in the underlying  vision, the Survey adds.

                India’s economic experience shows that the fiscal activism embraced  by advanced economies- giving a greater role to counter-cyclical  policies and attaching less weight to curbing debt- is not relevant for  India. This observation was made in the Economic Survey 2016-17  presented by the Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley in the Parliament  today. The Economic Survey has also stated that India’s fiscal  experience has underscored the fundamental validity of the fiscal policy  principles enshrined in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management  Act (FRBM) Act 2003.
Since the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), internationally  fiscal policy has seen a paradigm shift  from the emphasis on debts to  deficits, arguing for greater activism in flows (deficits) and  minimizing concerns about sustainability of the stocks (debt). But  India’s experience has reaffirmed the need for rules to contain fiscal  deficits, because of the proclivity to spend during booms and undertake  stimulus during downturns. India’s experience has also highlighted the  danger of relying on rapid growth rather than steady and gradual fiscal  and primary balance adjustment to do the “heavy lifting” on debt  reduction. In, short it has underscored the fundamental validity of the  fiscal policy principles set out in the FRBM.
Even as the basic tenets of the FRBM remain valid, the operational  framework designed in 2003 will need to be modified for the fiscal  policy direction of India of today, and even more importantly the India  of tomorrow. This setting out a new vision through an FRBM for the 21st  century will be the task of the FRBM Review Committee.

The Government says that the adverse impact of demonetisation on GDP growth will be transitional. The Economic Survey 2017 presented in Parliament today by 
 the union Finance Minister,  Shri Arun Jaitley states that once the cash supply is replenished, which is likely to be achieved by end March 2017, the economy would revert to the normal.  Therefore the real GDP growth in 2017-18 is projected to be in the range of 6¾-7½ percent.
The Economic Survey points out that demonetisation will have both short-term costs and long-term benefits as detailed in the attached table. Briefly, the costs include a contraction in cash money supply and subsequent, albeit temporary, slowdown in GDP growth; and benefits include increased digitalization, greater tax compliance and a reduction in real estate prices, which could increase long-run tax revenue collections and GDP growth. 
On the benefits side, early evidence suggests that digitalization has increased since demonetisation. On the cost side, effective cash in circulation fell sharply although by much less than commonly believed – a peak of 35 percent in December, rather than 62 percent in November since many of the old high denomination notes continued to be used for transactions in the weeks after 8th November  Additionally, remonetisation will ensure that the cash squeeze is eliminated by April 2017. The cash squeeze in the meantime will have significant implications for GDP, reducing 2016-17 growth by ¼ to ½ percentage points compared to the baseline of 7 percent. Recorded GDP will understate impact on informal sector because, for example, informal manufacturing is estimated using formal sector indicators (Index of Industrial Production). These contractionary effects will dissipate by year-end when currency in circulation should once again be in line with estimated demand, which would also allow growth to converge to a trend by FY 2017-18. 
The Economic Survey states that the weighted average price of real estate in eight major cities which was already on a declining trend fell further after November 8, 2016 with the announcement of demonetization. It goes on to add that an equilibrium reduction in real estate prices is desirable as it will lead to affordable housing for the middle class and facilitate labour mobility across India currently impeded by high and unaffordable rents.
The Survey suggests a few measures to maximize long-term benefits and minimize short-term costs. One, fast remonetisation and especially, free convertibility of cash to deposits including through early elimination of withdrawal limits. This would reduce the GDP growth deceleration and cash hoarding. Two, continued impetus to digitalization while ensuring that this transition is gradual, inclusive, based on incentives rather than controls and appropriately balancing the costs and benefits of cash versus digitalization. Three, following up demonetisation by bringing land and real estate into the GST. Four, reducing tax rates and stamp duties. And finally, an improved tax system could promote greater income declaration and dispel fears of over-zealous tax administration.

            GDP
            
            
            Growth   slowed, as demonetisation reduced demand (cash, private wealth), supply   (reduced liquidity and working capital, and disrupted supply chains), and   increased uncertainty 
            
            
            Could   be beneficial in the long run if formalization increases and corruption falls
            
        
        
             
            
            Cash-intensive   sectors (agriculture, real estate, jewellery) were affected more.
            Recorded   GDP will understate impact on informal sector because informal manufacturing   is estimated using formal sector indicators (Index of Industrial Production).   
            But   over time as the economy becomes more formalized the underestimation will   decline. 
            Recorded   GDP will also be overstated because banking sector value added is based (inter   alia) on deposits which have surged temporarily
            
            
            Informal   output could decline but recorded GDP would increase as the economy becomes   more formalized

            Uncertainty   increased, as firms and households were unsure of the economic impact and   implications for future policy
            Investment   decisions and durable goods purchases postponed
            
            
            Credibility   will be strengthened if demonetisation is accompanied by complementary   measures. Early and full remonetisation essential. Tax arbitrariness and   harassment could attenuate credibility

                The Economic Survey 2016-17 tabled in Parliament today by the Union  Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley has advocated the concept of  Universal Basic Income (UBI) as an alternative to the various social  welfare schemes in an effort to reduce poverty. The survey juxtaposes  the benefits and costs of the UBI scheme in the context of the  philosophy of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.  The Survey  states that the Mahatma as astute political observer, would have  anxieties about UBI as being just another add-on Government programme,  but on balance, he may have given the go-ahead to the UBI.
The Survey says the UBI, based on the principles of universality,  unconditionality and agency, is a conceptually appealing idea but with a  number of implementation challenges lying ahead especially the risk  that it would become an add-on to, rather than a replacement of, current  anti-poverty and social programmes, which would make it fiscally  unaffordable.
Based on a survey on misallocation of resources for the six largest  Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Sub-Schemes (except PDS and  fertilizer subsidy) across districts, the Economic Survey points out  that the districts where the needs are greatest are precisely the ones  where State capacity is the weakest. This suggests that a more efficient  way to help the poor would be to provide them resources directly,  through a UBI.
Exploring the principles and prerequisites for successful  implementation of UBI, the Survey points out that the two prerequisites  for a successful UBI are: (a) functional JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhar and  Mobile) system as it ensures that the cash transfer goes directly into  the account of a beneficiary and (b) Centre-State negotiations on cost  sharing for the programme.
The Survey says that a UBI that reduces poverty to 0.5 percent would  cost between 4-5 percent of GDP, assuming that those in the top 25  percent income bracket do not participate. On the other hand, the  existing middle class subsidies and food, petroleum and fertilizer  subsidies cost about 3 percent of GDP.
The Survey concludes that the UBI is a powerful idea whose time even  if not ripe for implementation, is ripe for serious discussion.

                The General Anti Avoidance Rule  (GAAR) provisions shall be effective from the Assessment Year 2018-19  onwards, i.e. Financial Year 2017-18 onwards.  The necessary procedures  for application of GAAR and conditions under which it shall not apply,  have been enumerated in Rules 10U to 10UC of the Income-tax Rules, 1962.The provisions of General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) are contained in Chapter X-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.  

Stakeholders and industry associations had  requested for clarifications on implementation of GAAR provisions and a  Working Group was constituted by Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to  examine the issues raised. Accordingly, CBDT has issued the  clarifications on implementation of GAAR provisions today.    

Amongst others, it has been clarified that  if the jurisdiction of FPI is finalized based on non-tax commercial  considerations and the main purpose of the arrangement is not to obtain  tax benefit, GAAR will not apply.  GAAR will not interplay with the  right of the taxpayer to select or choose method of implementing a  transaction. Further, grandfathering as per IT Rules will be available  to compulsorily convertible instruments, bonus issuances or split /  consolidation of holdings in respect of investments made prior to 1st  April 2017 in the hands of same investor. It has also been clarified  that adoption of anti-abuse rules in tax treaties may not be sufficient  to address all tax avoidance strategies and the same are required to be  tackled through domestic anti-avoidance rules. However, if a case of  avoidance is sufficiently addressed by Limitation of Benefits (LoB)  provisions in the tax treaty, there shall not be an occasion to invoke  GAAR. 

It has been clarified that if at the time  of sanctioning an arrangement, the Court has explicitly and adequately  considered the tax implications, GAAR will not apply to such an  arrangement. It has also been clarified that GAAR will not apply if an  arrangement is held as permissible by the Authority for Advance Rulings.  Further, it has been clarified that if an arrangement has been held to  be permissible in one year by the PCIT/CIT/Approving Panel and the facts  and circumstances remain the same, GAAR will not be invoked for that  arrangement in a subsequent year.

The proposal to apply GAAR will be vetted  first by the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax / Commissioner of  Income Tax and at the second stage by an Approving Panel headed by a  judge of High Court. The stakeholders have been assured that adequate  procedural safeguards are in place to ensure that GAAR is invoked in a  uniform, fair and rational manner. 

Government is committed to provide  certainty and clarity in tax rules. Further clarifications, if any, on  doubts of stakeholders regarding GAAR implementation, will also be  provided.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its post-facto approval for launching of Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana 2017 (VPBY 2017).  It is a part of Government’s commitment for financial inclusion and social security. 
 
The scheme will be implemented through Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) during the current financial year to  provide social security during old age and protect elderly persons aged 60 years and above against a future fall in their interest income due to uncertain market conditions. The scheme will provide an assured pension based on a guaranteed rate of return of 8% per annum for ten years, with an option to opt for pension on a monthly / quarterly / halfyearly and annual basis. The differential return, i.e., the difference between the return generated by LIC and the assured return of 8% per annum would be borne by Government of India as subsidy on an annual basis. 
 
VPBY-2017 is proposed to be open for subscription for a period of one year from the date of launch.

The  concept of Place of Effective Management (POEM) for deciding the  Residential Status of a company was introduced by the Finance Act, 2015.   It is effective from 01.04.2016 and accordingly shall apply from  assessment year 2017-18 onwards.  The guidelines for determining the  POEM has been uploaded on website of the Income-tax Department  (www.incometaxindia.gov.in). These guidelines of POEM have been  finalised, after placing draft guidelines in public domain for seeking  comments from stakeholders and general public, and with extensive  consultations thereafter.
The Final Guidelines on POEM contain some unique  features. Active Business outside India (ABOI) test has been provided,  so as not to cover companies outside India which are engaged in active  business. The intent is not to target Indian Multi Nationals which are  engaged in business activity outside India. The intent is to target  shell companies and companies which are created for retaining income  outside India although real control and management of affairs is located  in India. It is emphasised that these guidelines are not intended to  cover foreign companies or to tax their global income, merely on the  ground of presence of Permanent Establishment or Business connection in  India.
Adequate administrative safeguards have been  incorporated in the guidelines by mandating that the Assessing officer  (AO), before initiating inquiry for POEM in a case of a taxpayer, will  seek approval from Principal Commissioner of Income Tax/ Commissioner of  Income-tax. The AO shall also obtain approval from Collegium of  Principal Commissioners of Income-tax before holding that POEM of a  non-resident company is in India.
It has been further decided that the POEM guidelines  shall not apply to companies having turnover or gross receipts of Rs.  Fifty (50) Crore or less in a financial year.
The guidelines also contain illustrations to clarify the situations whether POEM shall or shall not apply.

India  participated in the Joint International Taskforce on Shared  Intelligence and Collaboration (JITSIC) meeting held in Paris on 16th and 17th January 2017 where 30 Revenue Authorities shared their findings on investigations arising from the Panama Papers;  including the role of tax intermediaries  such as financial institutions, advisers  etc,  who facilitate tax evasion. The meeting included sharing of best  practices and information between participating member countries based  on legal instruments under the tax treaties and OECD and Council of  Europe Multilateral Convention. The  sharing of this information within a group of this size is unique and  sets the basis for greater cooperation amongst tax administrations.
Since the last JITSIC meeting of  this group, significant achievements have been made including the  development of uniform approaches to requesting information between  treaty partners, clearer understanding of the evasion typologies adapted  by intermediaries, and new techniques for collating intelligence. JITSIC  will continue to draw on the best intelligence capabilities from tax  authorities around the world and share best practices for data analysis  and collaboration on intelligence. The tax administrations will,  accordingly, continue to share information under existing legal  frameworks for exchange.

The Union Government has been assisting the State Governments and  providing “Special Assistance” with a view to expediting their  completion of area specific Schemes.  This assistance is provided in  view of the Government of India’s commitment to fulfilling the  development agenda in backward region notwithstanding the fact that the  State Plan Schemes including BRGF (State Component) are subsumed in  larger devolution of Union Taxes and Duties to the States in terms of  Recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission (FFC) and are delinked  from the Union support with effect from 2015-16.  
            In this regard, following the recent release of Rs.200  crore to the State of Bihar, the Central Government has decided to  provide further “Special Assistance” of Rs.1129.40 crore to the State  during 2016-2017 for completion of the approved ongoing projects under  Special Plan for Bihar. These releases are in continuation to the  release of Rs.1,887.53 crore which was made by the Central Government  during the year 2015-16.  Including the present release of Rs.1129.40  crore, the Central Government has so far released Rs.6934.61 crore to  the State of Bihar. The Central assistance would facilitate completion  of ongoing projects such as strengthening of sub-transmission system  (including capacity augmentation) in North and South Bihar, renovation  and modernization of Barauni and Muzaffarpur Thermal Power Stations,  construction of transmission system at Kishanganj with associated  transmission lines, The release of fund would accelerate the completion  of much needed power generation and transmission system of Bihar which  in turn would lead to higher availability of electricity for the people  of the State.  
            The Central Government in order to honour its spill-over  committed liability had recently released Special Assistance of  Rs.367.93 crore to Odisha during 2016-17. This is the Final Instalment  for funding of projects under Special Plan for the KBK districts  (districts of Koraput, Bolangir and Kalahandi reorganized into eight  districts). The plan had an approved amount of Rs. 1,250 crore for the  12th Plan period. The Special Plan for the KBK districts has been in  operation since 2002-03. The area spreads over 47,646 sq. km. comprising  mainly rural population (89.95%) with a large proportion of STs  (38.41%) and SCs (16.25%) as per 2001 Census. The Schemes taken up under  this are  largely for Promotion of Education among ST/SC Girls and Boys  including development of playgrounds/sports activities in hostels and  schools, Improvement of Inter-District roads/other major roads/Rural  roads; Strengthening of Electric Supply Systems and Lift Irrigation/Deep  Bore-wells/Check Dams. 
            Further, keeping in mind the special needs of the State  of Jammu & Kashmir, the Central Government had released Rs.1194.37  crore during 2015-16, for completely damages /severely damaged/partially  damaged houses. Subsequently, during 2016-17, the Central Government  has made a further release of Rs.2207.30 crore to the State of Jammu  & Kashmir. This includes Rs.1093.34 for permanent restoration of  damaged structure, Rs.313.96 crore for counterpart funding for Asian  Development Bank-II loan under EAP projects of J&K Urban Sector  Development Investment Programme (JKUSDIP) in order to complete the  ongoing projects and Rs.800 crore for interest subvention on assistance  for the restoration of livelihood for traders/self employed/business  establishments etc. Cumulatively, the Central Government has so far  released Rs.3401.67 crore to the State as Special Assistance. 
            Similarly, the Central Government has used the Special  Assistance to support the newly formed States Of Andhra Pradesh and  Telangana. A further release of Rs.1,976.50 crore to the State Of Andhra  Pradesh was made during the Current Financial Year 2016-17. The amount  included Rs.1176.50 for bridging the Resource Gap arising-out of the  bifurcation of the erstwhile State, Rs.350 crore for the development of 7  Backward Districts of Anantpur, Chittoor, Cuddapah, Kurnool,  Srikakulam, Vizianagram, and Vishakhapatnam and Rs.450 crore as  assistance to the capital city, Amaravati. These additional resources  from the Central Government would enable the State to devise and  implement schemes best suited for mitigation of backwardness and  alleviation of poverty. In addition, grant of Rs.100 crore was released  for Polavaram Irrigation Project. Further, release of Rs.1981.54 crore  was made to the state through NABARD on 27.12.2016 as Central assistance  for Polavaram Irrigation Project by the Ministry of Water Resources,  River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation MoWR, RD & GR. 
            Further, in keeping with its commitments to support the  development of backward areas of Telangana, the Central Government had  provided a further “Special Assistance” of Rs.450 crore to the state.   The Backward Districts which are being supported with this development  fund are Adilabad, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Warangal, Medak, Mahbubnagar,  Rangareddy, Nalgoda and Khammam where the work of creating road network  has been taken-up.  
            The State of Tamil Nadu has also  been a beneficiary of this Special Assistance. An amount of Rs. 200  crore was released to the state to resolve the issues affecting  processing industry in Tirupur (Tamil Nadu), for adoption of Zero Liquid  Discharge by 18 Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs). This  provision will help the industries to minimize pollution and it will be a  step towards clean environment.

                There have been reports in sections of media stating that the Union Government has compromised the national interest by collaborating with a tainted UK based Note Printing Company.
The said company had been supplying bank note paper till 2010.  Further as per the decision taken in 2013, the company was permitted to supply a security feature for bank notes till December 2015.
No fresh contract has been given to this company by the Government during the last three years.  The Security Clearance for this company has been withheld by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India and hence no fresh orders have been placed with the said company since 2014. The company has applied for setting-up a factory in India. No action has been taken on their application.

                The  Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley reiterated the advantage of  taking bold and courageous decisions to transform Indian economy. He  said difficult decisions initially pass through difficult phases as  historic decisions have temporary pain attached to them. Speaking about  demonetization, Shri Jaitley said that India needs bold decisions as it  is time now to clean up the table and demonetization is going to have an  impact over the course of our present and future lives. Shri Jaitley  was addressing a seminar on ‘GST: The game changer for Indian economy’  on the second day of vibrant Gujarat Global Investors Summit at Mahatma  Mandir in Gandhinagar today.
 
Stressing  the implementation of GST, FM said that most of the issues have been  resolved; few critical issues are left which will be resolved in the  next few weeks. He further added that GST Council is deliberative  democracy in action and the impact of both GST and demonetization will  be felt this year.
FM  said, when GST merges all the taxes and makes India into one entity,  it's an advantage to the assesse. Once the GST is implemented, the  combination of a more digitized economy with a more efficient tax system  will make India better. The Minister said that People want  transparency. So, government is emphasizing on bringing transparency and  elimination of discretion and Indian economy has opened up  significantly in the last two years.
 About  the Summit, Shri Jaitley said it has been branded as Vibrant Gujarat  but it has become foremost economic conclave. It showcases both Indian  economy and progress of Gujarat.
Shri  Vijay Rupani, Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Nitin Patel, Dy. Chief  Minister of Gujarat, Dr. Hasmukh Adhia, Revenue Secretary, Govt. of  India, Shri Amarjeet Sohi, Minister of Infrastructure & Communities,  Government of Canada were also present on the occasion.

                The Income Tax Department is proud to announce that it has been conferred the Silver Award in the National Awards on e-Governance-2016-17 for the e-filing of Income Tax returns and other forms project in the category “Incremental Innovations” in existing projects. 
 
The award is in recognition of the achievements of the Department in the area of e-Governance and for significant innovations in successful e-Governance programs in the current Award period. The e-filing of Income Tax returns project had already won the Silver Award in the National Awards on e-Governance in 2007-08.
 
The path breaking innovations introduced by the Department in the e-filing of Income Tax returns project are:
 
      i.        Introduction of Electronic Verification Code (EVC)- This innovation introduced in July 2015 enables the citizen to electronically verify Income tax returns and other forms using EVC through third party authentication services provided by Aadhaar using Aadhaar OTP, authentication by banks using net banking, ATM, bank account validation and security depositories such as NSDL and CDSL using demat account validation. The taxpayer can use any of these authenticating mechanisms to receive an Electronic Verification Code (EVC) which can be entered after submission of a return to verify and complete the process. This year alone over 1.1 Cr Income Tax returns have been electronically verified using EVC thereby obviating the need to submit a paper copy of the ITR-V to CPC Bangalore as was being done earlier.
    ii.        Securing taxpayer account using E-filing Vault- This innovation aims at adding one more level of authentication to the process of login to the “My Account” of the tax payer and for resetting of password by leveraging the EVC concept. E-filing Vault enables the tax payer to completely secure the e-filing account to prevent any unauthorized access.
   iii.        Easy compliance through Non-Filers Monitoring and E-Sahyog- This innovation aims at providing convenience to the tax payer for submitting tax compliance response through the e-filing portal. The taxpayer can now sitting at home or office any time any where respond to any letter from the Department seeking taxpayer clarification regarding non filing of return or any mismatch in Income Tax return. This innovation has the potential to significantly reduce compliance cost and increase voluntary compliance.
 
The Income Tax Department is spurred by the recognition received and is encouraged to initiate more innovations to facilitate tax payers through its e-Governance programs.

    Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC) has initiated the process of migration of its existing CENTRAL EXCISE/SERVICE TAX assessees to GST with effect from 9th January, 2017.
            As part of its efforts to ensure implementation of GST by 1st April, 2017, CBEC has taken steps to ensure that its existing taxpayers are migrated to GST in a simple, user-friendly and smooth manner. Once the existing registered Taxpayers (both Central Excise as well as Service Tax) login to CBEC’s Web Portal www.aces.gov.in, a facility will be given in a secure manner to access the provisional login ID and password given by Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN). Thereafter, using the same, they can log in to GST Portal (www.gst.gov.in) to fill the required fields and submit scanned documents.
 However, if they have already initiated the process of migration to GST as a VAT asssessee under STATE COMMERCIAL TAX department, no further action is necessary.  PAN is mandatory for migration to GST. Hence, if the existing Central Excise/Service Tax Registration Code does not have PAN, then PAN has to be obtained from Income Tax Department and the Registration details have to be updated in the ACES Portal www.aces.gov.in
            CBEC has made available a 24x7 HELPDESK (TOLL-FREE NO 1800-1200-232, EMAIL: cbecmitra.helpdesk@icegate.gov.in) for the purpose of assisting existing CENTRAL EXCISE/SERVICE TAX assessees. GSTN also has a HELP DESK number: 0124-4688999 and GSTN email address is: help@gst.gov.in     A Step-by-Step Taxpayers User guide for Migration is available at www.aces.gov.in and at www.cbec.gov.in
CBEC is also sending Emails/recorded telephonic messages to all registered CENTRAL EXCISE / SERVICE TAX assessees requesting them to migrate to GST. Outreach programmes such as Awareness Workshops/ Training for CENTRAL EXCISE/SERVICE TAX assessees are being organized all over India at the Commissionerates and Divisional offices of CBEC.
All existing CENTRAL EXCISE/SERVICE TAX assessees are requested to migrate as early as possible, latest by 31st January, 2017.

Direct  Tax and Indirect tax collection figures for the period April 2016 to  December 2016 have shown a positive trend as Direct Taxes grow by 12.01%  and Indirect Taxes grow by 25% over the corresponding period last year  i.e. April-December 2015.  
The details in this regard are as follows:
                                                                                                                     
Direct Taxes
 
The figures for Direct Tax collections up to December, 2016 show that net collections are at Rs.  5.53 lakh crore which is 12.01% more than the net collections for the  corresponding period last year. This collection is 65.3% of the total  Budget Estimates of Direct Taxes for F.Y. 2016-17.  
 
            As  regards the growth rates for Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and Personal  Income Tax (PIT), in terms of gross revenue collections, the growth rate  under CIT is 10.7% while that under PIT (including STT) is 21.7%.  However, after adjusting for refunds, the net growth in CIT collections  is 4.4% while that in PIT collections is 24.6%. Refunds amounting to  Rs.1,26,371 crore have been issued during April-December, 2016, which is  30.5% higher than the refunds issued during the corresponding period  last year.
 
            After  accounting for the third instalment of advance tax received in  December, 2016, the collections under advance tax stand at Rs.2.82 lakh  crore, which is 14.4% higher than the figures for the corresponding  period of last year. CIT advance tax is growing at 10.6% while PIT  advance tax has registered a growth of 38.2%.
 
Indirect Taxes
 
            The figures for indirect tax collections  (Central Excise, Service Tax and Customs) up to December 2016 show that  net revenue collections are at Rs 6.30 lakh crore, which is 25% more  than the net collections for the corresponding period last year. Till  December 2016, about 81% of the Budget Estimates of indirect taxes for  Financial Year 2016-17 has been achieved. 
 
            As  regards Central Excise, net tax collections stood at Rs. 2.79 lakh  crore during April-December, 2016 as compared to Rs.1.95 lakh crore  during the corresponding period in the previous Financial Year, thereby  registering a growth of 43%.
 
            Net Tax collections on account of Service Tax during April-December,      2016  stood at Rs. 1.83 lakh crore as compared to Rs.1.48 lakh crore during  the corresponding period in the previous Financial Year, thereby  registering a growth of 23.9%.
 
            Net  Tax collections on account of Customs during April-December 2016 stood  at Rs. 1.67 lakh crore as compared to Rs. 1.60 lakh crore during the  same period in the previous Financial Year, thereby registering a growth  of 4.1%.
 
            During  December 2016, the net indirect tax (with ARM) grew at the rate of  14.2% compared to corresponding month last year. The growth rate in net  collection for Customs, Central Excise and Service Tax was -6.3%, 31.6%  and 12.4% respectively during the month of December, 2016, compared to  the corresponding month last year. The de-growth in customs collections  appear to be on account of a decline of gold imports by about 46% (in  volume terms) in December 2016 over December 2015.

Following is the full Text of the Article entitled “Demonetisation – A Look Back at the last Two Months” by the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley: 
 
“Two months have passed since  the Prime Minister announced the decision that high denominational  currency notes would cease to be a legal tender.  Subsequently those  notes have been demonetised.  When 86% of a country’s currency  constituting 12.2% of its GDP, is squeezed out of the market and sought  to be replaced by a new currency, there would obviously be significant  consequences of that decision.  Now that the queues outside the banks  have disappeared and the remonetisation has moved ahead, it would be  worthwhile to analyse the rationale behind the decision and its impact.
 
1.             Steps against Black Money
 
The Narendra Modi Government  had absolute clarity from day one that it would move against the shadow  economy and black money.  It’s first decision was to constitute SIT  under the directions of the Supreme Court.  The Prime Minister had  proposed to the G-20 at Brisbane that international cooperation in  sharing information with regard to base erosion and profit shifting  should be expedited.  The arrangement with the United States furthered  this object.  The NDA Government completed its agreement with  Switzerland that w.e.f. 2019, details of assets held by Indian citizens  in Switzerland and vice versa would be provided to each other.  Since  1996, the Double Taxation Avoidance Treaty with Mauritius was being  renegotiated.  The treaty effectively incentivised round-tripping.  It  was renegotiated.  Similar treaties with Cyprus and Singapore have also  been renegotiated.  The Black Money Law dealing with illegal assets  outside India opened a window for disclosure with 60% tax and provides a  ten year imprisonment. 
 
The Income Declaration Scheme  (IDS) 2016 was highly successful with a 45% tax.  The PAN card  requirement for cash transaction beyond rupees two lakhs put hurdles on  expenditure through black money.  The Benami law legislated in 1988 and  never implemented. It was amended and has been put into action.  The  GST, which is scheduled to be implemented this year, will provide for  better indirect tax administration and being a more efficient law will  check tax evasion.  The demonetisation of high denominational currency  notes was the big step in the same direction.
 
2.       The new normal
 
          In the year 2015-16, 3.7 crore assesses of the  total population of over 125 crores, filed income tax returns.  Out of  these, 99 lakhs declared income below Rs.2.5 lakhs and paid no taxes;  1.95 crores declared income less than Rs.5 lakhs; 52 lakhs declared  income between Rs.5 to10 lakhs, and only 24 lakhs declared income above  Rs.10 lakhs.  No better evidence is required to substantiate that both  in the matter of direct and indirect taxes India continues to suffer  being a hugely tax non-compliant society.
 
          Expenditure required for poverty eradication,  national security and economic development have to be compromised with  on account of tax non-compliances.  For seven decades the Indian  “normal” has been to undertake transactions partly in cash and partly in  cheque.  “Pucca” and “Kachha” accounts are a part of the business  language.  Tax evasion has been considered as neither unethical nor  immoral.  It was just a way of life.  Several Governments have allowed  this “normal” to continue even though this compromised with larger  public interest.  The Prime Minister’s decision is intended to create a  new “normal”.  It seeks to change the expenditure pattern of India and  Indians.  It is obviously disruptive.  All reforms are disruptive.  They  change the retrograde status quo.  The demonetisation puts a premium on  honesty and penalises dishonest conduct.
 
3.       The adverse consequences of Cash
 
          Paper currency is a zero interest anonymous  bearer bond.  It has no name or history attached to it.  Crime can take  place with or without cash but excessive cash as a medium of exchange is  favoured by the underground economy.  It results in non-compliance in  the matters of tax payments which creates an unjust enrichment in favour  of the evader as against the poor and the deprived.  Mountains of cash  money reach tax havens through the hawala route from the original paper  currency.  Cash facilitates real time untraceable payments.  Cash is the  medium which funds bribery, corruption, counterfeit currency and  terrorism.  Ethical and developed societies aided by technology have  consistently moved towards banking and digital transactions as against  the excessive use of cash.  Paper currency opens the doors for many  vices.  When Governments are able to collect more tax from tax evaders,  they are in a better position to collect less tax from everyone else.   Reducing cash may not eliminate crime and terrorism but it can inflict  serious blow on them.  States have shown that the stores of cash do not  disappear on their own till Governments take active steps to reduce the  quantum of paper currency. 
 
4.       The magnitude of the decision
 
          The Prime Minister’s decision to replace the  high denominational currency and eventually demonetise it required both  courage and stamina.  The implementation of the decision carried pain.   It can lead to short term criticism and inconveniences.  Drop in  economic activity on account of the currency squeeze during the  remonetisation period would have a transient impact on the economy.  The  decision involves high level of secrecy and printing substantial  amounts of paper currency, distribution through banks, post offices,  banking mitras and ATMs. 
The fact that large quantum  of high denominational currency has been deposited with the banks does  not render this money to be legitimate cash.  Black money does not  change its colour merely because it is deposited in bank.  On the  contrary, it loses its anonymity and can now be identified with its  owner.  The Revenue Department would thus be entitled to tax this  money.  In any case, the amendment to the Income Tax Act itself provides  that the said money, if voluntarily declared or if involuntarily  detected, would be liable for differential and high rates of taxation  and penalty. 
 
5.       The situation today
 
          The period of pain and inconveniences is  getting over.  Economic activity is being restored.  The banks today  admittedly have a lot more money available in order to lend for growth.   Since this money constitutes low cost deposits with the banks, it is  bound to bring down the rate of interest.  Both these things have  already happened.  Lakhs of crores, which were floating in the market as  lose currency, have now entered the banking system.  Not only has the  money lost is anonymity, it’s owners, after being taxed, are entitled to  put it to more effective uses.  The size of the banking transactions  and consequently the size of the economy is bound to increase.  In the  medium and long run, the GDP would be bigger and cleaner.  Money  entering into the banking system and officially transacted would give an  ample scope for higher taxation – both direct and indirect.  The Centre  and the State Governments would both stand to gain.  The economy would  also be serviced by both cash and highly digitized transactions. 
 
6.       The Opposition
 
          There was no social unrest while implementing  such a major decision.  All opinion polls conducted by independent media  organizations have shown that an overwhelmingly large percentage of  people have supported the Government’s decision.  The opposition  disrupted a full Session of Parliament.  Their protests have been  ineffective.  Their exaggerated claims on the disruption of the economy  have proved wrong.  It is a tragedy that a national party like the  Congress decided to adopt a political position, opposing both  technology, change and reforms.  It sided with black money friendly  status quo. 
 
 
7.       The marked difference
 
          There was a marked difference  in the approach of the Prime Minister and his opponents.  The Prime  Minister was being futuristic, and thinking of a more modern, technology  driven cleaner economy.  He is now speaking of cleaning the political  funding systems.  His opponents want a cash dominated, cash generating  and cash exchange system to continue.  The difference between Prime  Minister Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi was clear - the Prime Minister  was thinking of the next generation while Rahul Gandhi was only looking  at how to disrupt the next Session of Parliament.”

II.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Other initiatives for Tax Reforms:
 
·                     AGREEMENT BETWEEN INDIA AND MALDIVES
 
The  Agreement between India and Maldives for avoidance of double taxation  of income derived from International Air Transport was signed at  Government level during the visit of Hon’ble President of Maldives to  New Delhi on 11th April, 2016.  The  Agreement provides for relief from double taxation for airline  enterprises of India and Maldives by way of exemption of income derived  by the enterprise of India from the operation of aircraft in  international traffic, from Maldivian tax and vice-versa.  
 

 
·                     ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT (APA)
 
            In  order to create a tax-friendly atmosphere by way of reducing such  litigations arising out of transfer pricing and giving tax certainty on  the profits arising out of international transactions, the Government of  India introduced the APA programme in the year 2012. It gives tax  certainty for the Indian taxpayers regarding their international  transactions for a period of five future years without regular Transfer  Pricing Audits. Further, the Rollback provisions in the APA program were  introduced in the year 2014 to enable the taxpayer to roll back the  provisions of the APA for four previous years from the first year of the  APA period. This gives certainty of determination of Arm’s Length Price  (ALP) of the covered transactions for four past years and leads to  withdrawal of appeals on transfer pricing litigations on such  transactions, if any pending, by both sides.
 
            The  Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has entered into 115 APAs with the  taxpayers so far, which includes 7 bilateral APAs and 108 unilateral  APAs. Out of 115 APAs, a total of 47 unilateral APAs and 4 bilateral APA  have already been concluded in the first six months of the current  Financial Year. The CBDT expects more APAs to be concluded and signed in  the near future.
 
  
·                     MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE (MAP)
 
            MAP  is an alternative mechanism available to taxpayers through Double Tax  Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) for resolving disputes giving rise to  double taxation. Multi National Enterprises (MNEs) seek to resolve  transfer pricing disputes through this mechanism. In the last two years,  CBDT has invigorated the MAP proceedings with many countries. 
 
            A  historical framework agreement was reached in January 2015 with USA,  which has invoked the highest number of MAP requests relating to  Transfer Pricing disputes. This resulted in more than 100 cases getting  resolved in FY 2015-16, involving transfer pricing disputes amounting to  approximately Rs.5000 crore, which was unprecedented. In FY 2016-17  also, the momentum of resolution of MAP cases continues and 66 MAP cases  relating to Transfer Pricing issues and 42 cases relating to Treaty  Interpretation were agreed to be resolved during the meeting held in  October, 2016.
 
·                     SHIPPING BUSINESS
 
A  Circular bearing No 30 of 2016 has been issued by CBDT on 26/08/2016.  The Circular lays down guidelines that are to be followed by the  Assessing Officers at the time of issue of No Objection Certificate  leading to the Port Clearance of Ships belonging to the foreign shipping  companies and also assessment of voyage returns that are subsequently  filed by foreign ships.
 
The  Circular has done away with the administrative requirement of obtaining  a voyage NOC for Foreign Shipping Companies that are entitled for 100%  relief from payment of taxes in India on account of a Double Taxation  Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) that India has with the other country. The  Circular would improve ease of doing business in India for the Foreign  Shipping Companies.
·                     THE DIRECT TAX DISPUTE RESOLUTION SCHEME, 2016
 
In order to contain huge backlog of cases  pending in appeals and reduce unnecessary litigation, the ‘Direct Tax  Dispute Resolution Scheme, 2016’ (the Scheme), has been introduced.  Under the Scheme, an applicant, subject to conditions specified therein,  may seek resolution of appeals, pending with the Commissioner (Appeals)  as on 29th February, 2016 in respect of disputed income and disputed  wealth, and with any appellate authority in respect of tax arrears  (specified tax) resulting out of retrospective amendment.
 
The Scheme came into effect on the 1st of June, 2016, and shall be open up to 31st day of December, 2016.  The  Direct Tax Dispute Resolution Rules have been notified vide  Notification No.34 & 35, dated 26.05.2016. In order to resolve  various issues raised by the stakeholders, a clarification in the form  of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) has been issued vide Circular No.  33 dated 12th September, 2016. All efforts to publicize the Scheme and  encourage taxpayers to avail of the opportunity are being made.
 
 III.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      E-GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES
 
·                     e-payment of taxes
 
E-payment of taxes has been  enabled through Net Banking and ATMs and more than 88.49% of tax is  collected through this mode facilitating payment to taxes anytime from  home/office without having to go to a bank branch. Companies and  auditable cases (taxpayers where provisions of section 44AB of the  Income-tax Act, 1961 are applicable) are mandatorily required to  electronically pay taxes. The percentage of tax collected using  electronic payment option has increased to 74.91% in count terms and  88.49% in value terms during FY 2015-16. 
 
·                     Refund Banker Scheme
 
With a view to eliminate the  interface between the Department and the taxpayer on account of the  manual issue and dispatch of refund cheques, the Department decided to  streamline and automate the process of printing and sending of refund  cheques the Department initiated a centralized system for printing and  credit of refund cheques through the State Bank of India which was  called the Refund Banker Scheme. 
This ensures that taxpayer gets  his refunds directly into his bank account or dispatch of the cheque by  speed post from 18 different locations of SBI across the country without  any intervention and avoiding delays in decentralized posting of  cheques etc. The refunds despatched under this scheme now account for  99% of the refunds (in count) received by the taxpayer without any  direct interaction with the Department. 
 
·                     Non-filers Monitoring System (NMS)
 
The  Non-filers Monitoring System (NMS) has been rolled-out for pilot  implementation to prioritize action on non-filers with potential tax  liabilities. Data analysis was carried out to identify non-filers about  whom specific information was available in the AIR, CIB and TDS/TCS  Returns database. The number of non-filers with potential tax  liabilities identified in various NMS cycles is as under:
 
·                     NMS cycle 1 (2013): 12.19 lakh
·                     NMS Cycle 2 (2014): 22.09 lakh
·                     NMS Cycle 3 (2015): 44.07 lakh
·                     NMS Cycle 4 (2015): 58.95 lakh
 
Under  this initiative, more than 94 lac returns have been filed and  self-assessment tax of more than Rs. 16,500 crore has been paid by the  target segment.
 
 
·                     Project Insight
 
The  Income Tax Department signed contract for implementation of Project  Insight in July 2016. Project Insight aims to develop a comprehensive  platform for effective utilization of information to promote voluntary  compliance and deter noncompliance; to impart confidence that all  eligible persons pay appropriate tax; and to promote fair and judicious  tax administration. 
 
The  Project would play a key role in data mining to track tax evaders and  widening of the tax-base. The new technical infrastructure will also be  leveraged for implementation of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Inter  Governmental Agreement (FATCA IGA) and Common Reporting Standard (CRS).
 
The  Project envisages the creation of two new centres, namely (i) a new  Compliance Management Central Processing Centre (CMCPC) for handling PAN  population, master data management, preliminary verification,  generation of bulk letters/notices and follow-up for greater  productivity and efficiency; and (ii) an Income Tax Transaction Analysis  Centre (INTRAC) for data integration, data processing, data quality  monitoring, data analytics, web and text mining, enterprise reporting,  alert and compliance management and research support.
 
The Project will be rolled out in a phased manner during the period 2016-18.
 
·                     Tax Deduction at Source
 
1.                  Tax  Deduction at Source (TDS) is one of the means of collection of direct  taxes. TDS constitutes nearly 40% of the direct tax collections. Since  the information submitted by the deductor in the TDS Statement, forms  the basis on which the deductee is given the credit of taxes, therefore,  there was a need to have a robust mechanism that ensures correct,  reliable flow of data to the database of Income Tax Department and its  collation on the basis of taxpayers’ identifier (Permanent Account  Number).
2.                  Centralized Processing Cell for TDS, CPC(TDS), has  been conceptualized to undertake end-to-end processing of TDS  Statements through a Rule based Technology enabled system, leading to  uniform results and faster turn-around-time, ensuring seamless flow of  data for tax credits. CPC-TDS introduces transparency in the processes  through online display of information and provides an integrated  platform for tax deductors, taxpayers and the officers of the  Department. Thus, it forms the backbone of overall TDS administration in  the country. 
3.                  CPC(TDS) is a technology driven transformation initiative for TDS administration that provides a comprehensive solution through Tax Deduction, Reconciliation, Analysis and Correction Enabling System (TRACES), its core engine.
4.                  CPC(TDS) undertakes processing of TDS Statements to generate “Annul Tax  Credit” statements for each taxpayer in form of 26AS, TDS Certificates  in Form 16/16A and identifies TDS Defaults of Short Payment, Short  Deduction, Interest etc.
5.                  CPC(TDS) reconciles and correlates information from various sources  including Banks (tax payment), Deductors (reporting tax deduction),  Assessing Officers (mapping of no/low tax deductions) and Tax  Professionals (reporting International transactions).
6.                  With a robust tax reconciliation mechanism put in place  through the CPC(TDS), the tax payer is given accurate and timely credit  for the taxes paid/deducted. This has led to faster refunds and minimal  grievances. The savings for the tax payers include: -
 
o        Cost of maintaining voluminous physical TDS certificates. 
o        Cost involved in reconciliation of taxes with the deductors 
o        Cost involved in submitting income tax returns in paper form with annexures. 
 
7.                  Facility of sending SMS alerts to salaried taxpayers of TDS deposited by his deductor/ employer launched in October, 2016.
 
 
·                     E-filing of Income Tax Returns 
 
E-filing of Income Tax Returns was introduced for the 1st  time in 2006-07 for corporates. The No. of e-file returns has increased  from around 4 lacs in F.Y. 2006-07 to 434 lacs in F.Y. 2015-16. Nearly  74% of the e-returns are voluntarily filed; this facility is free of  cost to tax-payers. E-returns now constitute for nearly 85% of total  returns filed with the Department. In F.Y. 2015-16 nearly 434 lacs  e-returns have been filed  in  comparison to 341 lacs e-return filed during F.Y. 2014-15 representing a  growth of around 27%. No of e-returns filed during F.Y. 2015-16 (upto  30.09.2015) stands at 245 lacs in comparison to 289 lacs  e-returns filed for the corresponding period of  F.Y. 2016-17( upto 30.09.2016)  registering a growth of 17%. 
 
E-filing project had won the National Silver E-Governance Award for Citizen Centric Service in 2007-08.

IV.             GOOD GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES
 
Directorate of Income-tax (Tax Payer Services) 
 
CBDT  vide Order No. F.No.A-11011/02/2015-Ad.VII dated 26.02.2016 has created  the Directorate of Income-tax (Tax Payer Services)-I.   The dedicated TPS vertical has been created for streamlining the delivery and monitoring of taxpayer services.  The Directorate is responsible for overseeing all matters relating to grievances.  The  initiative of the department is intended to provide effective  resolution of grievances and thereby providing ease of compliance and  better taxpayer services. 
 
Monitoring and Administration of Taxpayer Services through ASK Centres 
 
            As  per the structure of the Tax Payer Services delivery and monitoring  system, Aaykar Seva Kendra (ASK) has been made the smallest unit for Tax  Payer Services.  Aayakar  Seva Kendra (ASK) is the mechanism used by CBDT for implementing the  philosophy of ‘Sevottam’ initiated by the PMO. Aayakar Seva Kendra (ASK)  is the single window system for implementation of Citizen’s Charter of  the Income Tax Department and a mechanism for achieving excellence in  public service delivery. The procedure to be followed at the ASKs is  provided in the Process Document of the Service Quality Manual(SQM).
 
            There  are approx. 300 ASKs functioning in the Income-tax Department. After an  ASK achieves excellence in service delivery as per norms under the  Sevottam Scheme, a certification under IS 15700:2005 is to be obtained  from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).  In this regard, the BIS have certified 80 ASK Centres under the IS 15700: 2005.  The work of certification of the other ASKs is under progress.   
 
            The  continuous monitoring and visits to the ASK Centres by this Directorate  has contributed to increased awareness amongst the officers regarding  disposal of DAK using the Sevottam Software and has resulted in improved  performance in the area of grievance redressal.  
 
 
Revamped ASKs using e-Nivaran
 
            Unified  Grievance Handling Mechanism (e-Nivaran) is aimed at consolidating  grievances received across all platforms viz. CPGRAMs, E-filing,  CPC-ITR, CPC-TDS, ASK, NSDL, UTIISL and SBI-Refund Banker. Internal  channelization of grievances between different department systems and  workflow based grievance resolution mechanism in the ITBA for department  users is aimed at centralized monitoring and speeding the grievance  redressal mechanism. Out of 1.07 lakh grievances received on e-Nivaran  platform, 0.78 lakh grievances (73%) have already been resolved.

                  v.                        Amendment in Rule 114B of the Income Tax Rules (the Rules) in 2015 whereby quoting of PAN has been made mandatory for sale or purchase of goods or services above Rs. 2 Lakh. [2015] 
 
                vi.                        Amendment  of Rule 114E of the IT Rules to strengthen third party reporting  mechanism to allow annual aggregate of the transaction values to trigger reporting of transactions. [2015]
 
              vii.                        Amendment  of section 6 of IT Act, to enable determination of residence of a  company incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction on the basis of “place of effective management” (POEM) [Finance Act, 2016]
 
            viii.                        Country-by-country reporting requirements for MNCs have been introduced to address Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. [Finance Act, 2016]
 
6.         Streamlining of information collection system: 
 
AIR reporting regime has been replaced with the Statement of Financial Transaction (SFT)  and has been expanded to cover a larger segment of transactions  including personal consumption expenditure. The new rule 114E regarding  furnishing of SFT has come into effect from 1.4.2016. This new regime  will enable capture of high value cash transactions in select sectors,  lead to widening of tax base through identification of new tax payers,  non-filers and stop filers, curb tax evasion in a non-intrusive manner  and encourage use of plastic money.
 
7.                  Investigation in HSBC foreign bank accounts cases:
 
Investigations  based on information received from French Government on Indians holding  bank accounts in HSBC bank in Switzerland has resulted into detection  of considerable amount of undisclosed income. Concealment penalty of  about Rs.1282 crores has also been levied in 159 cases and 164 prosecution complaints have been filed in 75 cases.
 
8.         Investigation in cases revealed by International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ):
 
In 2013, the ICIJ, a Washington  based organization, put out in public information pertaining to offshore  entities based in no tax or low tax jurisdictions, including many  Indian entities. Investigations of these cases by the Income Tax  Department have led to detection of substantial amounts of deposits in these undisclosed foreign accounts. Investigations have led to filing of 55 prosecution complaints in 24 such cases. Investigations are also on in cases revealed in ‘Panama Papers leaks’ by ICIJ in 2016. A high level Multi-Agency Group (MAG) has been constituted for the purpose.  So far, the MAG has submitted 5 reports to the Government. 
 
 
9.         The Income Declaration Scheme, 2016:
 
The Income Declaration Scheme, 2016 (the  Scheme) came into effect from 1st June, 2016. It provided an opportunity  to persons who had not paid full taxes in the past to come forward and  declare their domestic undisclosed income and assets. Declarations could  be made online as well as in printed copies of the prescribed Form up  to midnight on 30th September, 2016.
 
In order to facilitate the taxpayers and to  spread awareness about the Scheme, the CBDT issued a number of FAQs to  address various queries received. Major issues clarified included manner  of declaration of fictitious liability, allowance of cost indexation  and holding period benefit for registered immovable property, sanctity  of valuation report etc. Difficulties with respect to payment of taxes  in a short span were removed by permitting payment of tax in 3  instalments, the last being in September 2017. Absolute confidentiality  was promised under the scheme in respect of the declarations made to  reassure the declarants. Innovative publicity methods like Talkathons,  Walkathons, Nukkad Nataks, etc. were used to spread awareness about the  Scheme. The Department’s strategic use of taxpayer information and data  mining techniques further spurred the declarations.
 
These steps resulted in a tremendous  response, especially in the last two months. As a consequence, 71,726  declarations were filed up to the midnight of 30th September, 2016 with  an aggregate of Rs. 67,382 Crore worth of hitherto undeclared incomes in  the form of cash and other assets being declared. 
 
10.       Indo-Swiss Exchange of Information
 
            India  and Switzerland have an exchange of information relationship under the  Indo-Swiss Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) and the Indian  Competent Authority regularly pursues all the outstanding cases with  Switzerland.
 
            As  fighting the menace of Black Money stashed in offshore accounts has  been a key priority area for this Government, to further this goal, the  Indian Prime Minister met with the Swiss President at Geneva on 6th  June 2016 and discussed the need for expeditious exchange of  information for combatting tax evasion together with an early start to  negotiations on the Agreement for Automatic Exchange of Information. As a  follow up, India’s Revenue Secretary and Switzerland's State Secretary  for International Financial Matters met in New Delhi on 15.06.2016 and  agreed to move towards an early agreement for the implementation of AEOI  between the two countries. It was also decided that experts of both the  countries will meet to further discuss the modalities for the  reciprocal bilateral implementation of AEOI between India and  Switzerland with a view to reaching an agreement at the earliest,  possibly by the end of the year. This meeting was conducted on 5-6th September 2016. The experts from both the sides agreed for the early implementation of AEOI.
 
 
11.              Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI)
 
            Automatic  Exchange of Information is systematic and periodic transmission of  “bulk” taxpayer information by the source country to the residence  country, which is possible under most of the DTAAs and Multilateral  Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. 
 
            On 3rd  June 2015, India joined the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement  (MCAA) on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (AEOI)  under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) based on the provisions of the  Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax  Matters (Multilateral Convention). The AEOI standards are very wide in  scope and oblige the treaty partners to exchange wide range of financial  information after collecting the same from financial institutions in  their country/jurisdictions including information about the ultimate  controlling persons and beneficial owners of entities. Till now, 84  countries have signed MCAA for AEOI. 101 countries have committed for  AEOI. From 2017 onwards, 54 countries will start exchanging information  automatically. And from 2018 onwards, it is expected that another 47  countries will start exchanging information automatically.
 
12.              Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
 
            On 9th  July, 2015, India and USA signed an Inter-Governmental Agreement  (“IGA”) to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) of  the USA to promote transparency between the two nations on tax matters.  The Union Cabinet in its meeting on 17th March, 2015 approved the signing and  ratification of the IGA under the provisions of the Double Taxation  Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) between India and USA. Under the IGA, the  USA will provide certain information to India, which includes the name,  address and Indian TIN of any person that is resident of India and holds  a reportable financial account in USA, along with the account number  and gross amount of interest, US source dividends or other income paid  or credited, depending on the nature of the financial account. On the  similar lines, India will also provide the information to USA.
 
            Reporting of information under the IGA with USA began from 30th  September, 2015 and information pertaining to the calendar year 2014  & 2015 has already been exchanged between the two countries.
 
13.              Implementation of AEOI under CRS and FATCA
 
            For  implementation of AEOI and FATCA, amendment was carried out in the  Income Tax Act, 1961 through Finance Act, 2014. Vide Notification No. 62  of 2015 dated 7th August, 2015, the Income-tax Rules, 1962  have been amended by inserting Rules 114F to 114H and Form 61B. To  provide guidance to the Financial Institutions and other stake holders  for ensuring compliance with the reporting requirements provided in  Rules 114F to 114H and Form 61B of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, a  Guidance Note was issued on 31.08.2015.  On this Guidance Note, feedback and comments were received from many financial institutions.  Meetings  were held with financial institutions, regulators and other stake  holders for providing guidance for implementation. Thereafter, an  updated version of the Guidance Note was released on 31.12.2015 and the  latest version has been released on 31.05.2016. The new account  due-diligence procedures have started from the 01.01.2016 and first  reporting will be done in September 2017 for the year 2016. 
 
            Signing  of the IGA with USA and India joining the MCAA are important milestones  in India’s fight against the menace of black money as it would enable  the Indian tax authorities to receive financial account information of  Indians from foreign countries on an automatic basis. This will also  enable the Government of India to receive information about taxpayers  hiding their money in offshore financial centres and tax havens through  multi-layered entities with non-transparent ownership from the  jurisdictions that are signatories to the MCAA and committed to the  international AEOI standards. 
 
14.              Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
 
 
            Base  Erosion and Profit Shifting refers to strategies adopted by taxpayers  having cross-border operations to exploit gaps and mismatches in tax  rules of different jurisdictions which enable them to shift profits  outside the jurisdiction where the economic activities giving rise to  profits are performed and where value is created. BEPS has been a cause  of concern for developing and emerging economies for long as it erodes  their tax base depriving them of much needed resources for developmental  activities. It is also unfair to general taxpaying public and further  provides an unfair competitive advantage to Multinational Enterprises  (MNEs) vis-à-vis domestic companies having no opportunities for the BEPS  strategies. 
 
            India  participated in the BEPS Project engaging constructively and  extensively by direct participation in CFA, Working Parties and Focus  Groups set up under CFA in finalizing the deliverables of BEPS Package  with the twin objectives of (a) collaborating with other countries in  development of recommendations to prevent base erosion and profit  shifting and (b) safeguarding the interests of India and other  developing countries in development of new standards.
 
            The  major package of recommendations of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting  (BEPS) Project, were endorsed by the G20-Leaders at Antalya, Turkey in  November, 2015. However some elements of the BEPS Action Plan have yet  to be finalised in 2016 and 2017 and the main tasks ahead relate to the  implementation of the agreed package. India being a G-20 member country,  and having played a very active role in the BEPS Project so far, is  fully committed to conclusion of pending design of rules in certain  Action Items and to ensure the successful implementation of the  recommendations of BEPS Project in 2016, 2017.
 
            Recently,  the G-20/OECD Inclusive Framework has been constituted to monitor and  review the implementation of the BEPS Package of recommendations on a  global basis, with participation from all the relevant jurisdictions on  an equal footing. As a follow up to the call of the G-20 Finance  Ministers meeting in April 2016, the first plenary meeting of  the G-20/OECD Inclusive Framework was held at Kyoto from 30th June to 1st July 2016 and the 1st meeting of the Steering Group of the Inclusive Framework held on 18-19th October, 2016.
 
            Further,  for implementation of BEPS at the local level, the Central Board of  Direct Taxes in the Ministry of Finance has constituted a committee of  officers to examine all the 15 reports and chalk out a clear-cut roadmap  for implementing the recommendations contained in these reports.  Implementation would be through amendments to the Income-tax Act, 1961  or through framing of Rules and Guidelines. Amendments based on some  actions points in the BEPS Reports such as equalization levy and  country-by-country reporting have already been introduced in the statute  through the Finance Act, 2016.
 
15.              AGREEMENTS SIGNED AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
 
A  Protocol for amendment of the Convention for the avoidance of Double  Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on  Income and Capital Gains between India and Mauritius was signed between  both countries on 10th May, 2016 and entered into force in India on 19th  July, 2016. The Protocol has amended the existing DTAC to provide for  source based taxation of capital gains in shares. India has been trying  to amend the Mauritius DTAC since 1990s and signing of Protocol is  culmination of such efforts. The Protocol will tackle treaty abuse and  round tripping of funds attributed to the India-Mauritius Treaty, curb  revenue loss, prevent non-taxation, streamline flow of investment and  streamline the flow of exchange of information between India and  Mauritius.
 
Working  Group to examine consequential issues arising out of amendment to the  India – Mauritius DTAC has been constituted by CBDT with representatives  from banks, custodians, brokerage firms and fund managers. The Working  Group will submit its report this year after examining the relevant  issues raised by stakeholders.
 
The  revised DTAA between India and Korea signed at government level during  the visit of the Prime Minister of India, to Seoul, Korea on 18th May,  2015 has entered into force.  The  revised DTAA, aims to avoid the burden of double taxation on tax payers  in two countries in order to promote and thereby stimulate flow of  investment, technology and services from Korea to India and vice versa  and to provide tax certainty to the residents of India and Korea.  Besides, it would facilitate Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAPs)in  transfer pricing cases and bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)  
            
The  amending Protocol to the Double Taxation Avoidance Convention (DTAC)  for the avoidance of double taxation and for the prevention of fiscal  evasion with respect to taxes on income between India and Japan signed  on 11.12.2015 has come into force from 29.10.2016.The Protocol provides  for internationally accepted standards for effective exchange of  information on tax matters including bank information and information  without domestic tax interest. The Protocol also provides that both  India and Japan shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of  revenue claims.
 
India  entered into Agreements with Seychelles and Maldives for exchange of  information with respect to taxes during the year. The Agreements will  stimulate exchange of information between India and the said countries  for tax purposes which will help curb tax evasion and tax avoidance.
 
16.       OTHER INTERNATIONAL TAX INITIATIVES
 
A  Zero Draft on Tax Cooperation was included in the Goa Declaration of  the BRICS Summit. The Goa Declaration highlighted that aggressive tax  planning and tax practices hurt equitable development and economic  growth. Base Erosion and Profit Shifting must be effectively tackled.  The BRICS countries declared that profit should be taxed in the  jurisdiction where the economic activity is performed and the value is  created. The BRICS Countries affirmed their commitment to support  international cooperation in this regard including the Common Reporting  Standard for Automatic Exchange of Tax Information (AEOI).
 
Meeting  of BRICS Heads of Tax Authorities and Experts is scheduled to be held  on 5-6th December, 2016 in Mumbai. The preparations for the Meeting of  BRICS Heads of Tax Authorities and Experts have been started and  confirmation has been received from the BRICS member countries. The  meeting proposes to discuss the implementation of the Goa declaration on  tax cooperation and also other tax issues affecting the member  countries.

India and Kazakhstan  signed here today  in the national capital a Protocol to amend the  existing Double Taxation Avoidance Convention (DTAC) between the two  countries  which was earlier signed on 9th December, 1996 for the avoidance of double taxation and for the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. 
Salient features of the Protocol are as under: 

(i) The Protocol  provides internationally accepted standards for effective exchange of  information on tax matters. Further, the information received from  Kazakhstan for tax purposes can be shared with other law enforcement  agencies with authorisation of the competent authority of Kazakhstan and  vice versa.
(ii) The Protocol  inserts a Limitation of Benefits Article, to provide a main purpose test  to prevent misuse of the DTAC and to allow application of domestic law  and measures against tax avoidance or evasion. 

(iii) The Protocol  inserts specific provisions to facilitate relieving of economic double  taxation in transfer pricing cases. This is a taxpayer friendly measure  and is in line with India’s commitment under Base Erosion and Profit  Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan to meet the minimum standard of providing  Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) access in transfer pricing cases. 

(iv) The Protocol  inserts service PE provisions with a threshold and also provides that  the profits to be attributed to PE will be determined on the basis of  apportionment of total profits of the enterprise. 

(v) The Protocol  replaces existing Article on Assistance in Collection of Taxes with a  new Article to align it with international standards.

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has started the year 2017 by entering into three unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) today.
 
The three APAs signed today pertain to the Engineering Goods and Shipping sectors of the economy. The international transactions covered in these agreements include Intra-group Services and Support Services.
 
With this, the total number of APAs entered into by the CBDT has reached 120 which includes 7 bilateral APAs and 113 Unilateral APAs. A total of 56 APAs (4 bilateral APAs and 52 unilateral APAs) have been entered into in the current financial year till date. The CBDT expects more APAs to be concluded and signed in the near future.
 
The APA Scheme was introduced in the Income-tax Act in 2012 and the “Rollback” provisions were introduced in 2014. The scheme endeavours to provide certainty to taxpayers in the domain of transfer pricing by specifying the methods of pricing and setting the prices of international transactions in advance. Since its inception, the APA scheme has evinced a lot of interest from taxpayers and that has resulted in more than 700 applications (both unilateral and bilateral) being filed in just four years.
 
The progress of the APA Scheme strengthens the Government’s resolve of fostering a non-adversarial tax regime. The Indian APA programme has been appreciated nationally and internationally for being able to address complex transfer pricing issues in a fair and transparent manner. The approach and functioning of the officers in the APA teams have been appreciated and acknowledged by the industry in India and abroad.

Following are the major reform measures, policy initiatives and achievements of the Department of Expenditure (DOE), Ministry of Finance during the current Financial Year 2016-17:
 
Public Financial Management System (PFMS):  
               
            The Public Financial Management System (PFMS) is a web-based online software application, developed and implemented by the o/o CGA with technical support of NIC. The primary objective of PFMS is to facilitate a sound Public Financial Management System for Government of India (GoI) by establishing an efficient fund flow system as well as a Payment cum Accounting network. PFMS provides various stakeholders with a real time, reliable and meaningful Management Information System and an effective Decision Support System (DSS), as part of the Digital India initiative of GoI. 
              The biggest strength of PFMS is its integration with the banking network  in the country. As a result, PFMS has the unique capability to push online payments to almost any beneficiary/vendor having account in any bank across the country.. At present, PFMS interface is completed with the Core Banking System (CBS) of all Public Sector Banks (26), Regional Rural Banks (54), major private sector banks (14), Reserve Bank of India, India post and Cooperative Banks (55). 
              The Government has emphasized the need for improved financial management in implementation of Central government Schemes so as to facilitate Just-in-time releases and monitor the usage of funds including information on its ultimate utilization.  In order to abide by the directions to implement Just-in-Time releases and monitor the end usage of funds, an action plan for universal roll-out of PFMS for Central Government schemes has been approved which inter alia includes mandatory registration of all Implementing Agencies on PFMS and mandatory use of Expenditure Advance and Transfer(EAT)module of PFMSW by all IAs.
Achievements under PFMS:

    PFMS      has been fully implemented at the Central Government level for all Plan      and Non Plan Scheme releases from Civil Ministries / Departments of the      Central Govt. 
    The      Implementing Agencies are using the PFMS application for both transfer of      funds to Agencies below and for e-payment to beneficiaries by direct credit      to their accounts either in bank branches or in post offices.
    So      far 18 lakh (approx) Implementing Agencies are registered on PFMS (till 30th      November, 2016).

    NTRP      i.e Non Tax Receipts Portal has been started from 16th      February, 2016 and this is a great step towards Hon’ble PM’s Digital India      Initiative. It facilitates online receipt of Non Tax Receipts for GoI      Departments/Ministries. 24,277 credits have been received for Rs.77565.53      crores upto 30.11.2016.

Departments/organizations/PSUs is integrated with PFMS for facilitating      the e-payment of bills received online through GeM portal by the respective      Pay and Accounts Offices.
    PFMS      treasury integration is currently operational in 12 states and integration      process has been initiated in other states also. It is expected to be      completed by 31st March 2017.

 
 
New Initiatives/ Achievements under Internal Audit
 
·         The Controller General of Accounts (CGA) has developed a risk based control framework in the form of Generic Internal Audit Manual to guide the internal audit engagements. The manual not only explain the complexities associated with the internal audit functions but also facilitates the entire process by providing audit process, templates and guidelines. 
 
·         The work of development of 2nd version of the Generic Internal Audit Manual in association with the Institute of the Internal Auditors (IIA) India has also been commenced in November, 2016. The revised Generic Internal Audit Manual will be developed as per International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF). The revised version will also include recommendations made by the Ministry of Women and Child Development to include the guidelines on Gender Audit of Policies, Programmes and Schemes of the Government of India. 
 
·         A directional shift in the scope and approach of internal audit has been initiated by the organization by infusing two concepts- “Risk Assessment” and Performance Evaluation” for strengthening financial management and internal controls. The line Ministries are being encouraged to plan the audit assignments by adopting the Risk Based Auditing approach. Risk Based Audit in selected Ministries is being conducted on pilot basis.
 
·         The organization is also focusing on the use of Computer Assisted Audit Tools for more transparency and accountability. Electronic Risk Assessment Software (e RAS), a diagnostic tool for internal audit has been developed in collaboration with NIC. This diagnostic tool [e RAS] is not only helpful to the audit in planning, sampling and conducting the audit efficiently but it  is also helpful to the management / stakeholders to have a review of the functioning of their entities [PAOs only] in their offices instead of visiting these offices located at different places in different states. 
 
·        The organization is regularly reviewing the performance of the internal audit units of the line Ministries/Departments. The Annual Review on the performance of Internal Audit Wings of Civil Ministries depicts the information on different shortcomings of the Civil Ministries in the form of observations. The Annual performance reports of the different Ministries/Departments are analyzed and summarized by the Internal Audit Division for the purposes of brevity and ease of presentation.  The outcome of Internal Audit through recoveries effected in pursuance to the observations of the Internal Audit is also included to reflect the impact of Internal Audit. 
 
 
 
·        The Annual Review for the year 2015-16 of Internal Audit conducted by the field units of the organization in the Civil Ministries/Departments have been submitted to Ministry of Finance. The audit findings have been quantified on the basis of financial implications  and  constitute an amount of Rs.85392.20 crore under the following categories:-

As recommended by Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) for its award period (2015-20), net borrowing ceilings of the States for the year 2016-17 at Rs. 4,29,353 crore have been fixed anchoring the Fiscal Deficit target of 3% of respective States’ Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).
Consequent to the recommendation of FFC, the Union Government has approved on 06.04.2016 year-to-year flexibility for additional fiscal deficit to States for the period 2016-17 to 2019-20 to a maximum of 0.5% over and above the normal limit of 3% in any given year to the States subject to the States maintaining the debt-GSDP ratio within 25% and interest payments-revenue receipts ratio within 10% in the previous year. However, the flexibility in availing the additional fiscal deficit will be available to State if there is no revenue deficit in the year in which borrowing limits are to be fixed and in the immediate preceding year. Additional Borrowings Limit of Rs. 10918 crore has been allowed to six states in 2016-17 on this account.

The Central Pension Accounting Office (CPAO):
 
It was established w.e.f. 1st Jan, 1990 for Payment and Accounting of Central (Civil) Pensioners and Pension to Freedom Fighters etc.  
 
Achievements/ Initiatives
The primary function of CPAO is to issue SSAs to the CPPCs of Banks in fresh and revision of pension cases. In 2015-16 highlights are as follows: – 
·      In 2015-16; 34,407 and 1, 39,927 authorities were issued in fresh and revision pension cases respectively.  In 2016-17, till 1st Dec, 2016; 24,959 and 1, 01,954 authorities were issued in fresh and revision pension cases respectively.

·         Paperless movements of digitally signed e-Revision Authority from Central Pension Accounting Office (CPAO) which was started as pilot in 4 Banks i.e. SBI, CPPC, Chandni Chowk, PNB, Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank has now been rolled out in 23 banks resulting in saving of time and operational cost and improvement in efficiency.
·         To make Digital India Mission of the Government successful, the pensioners have been made aware of the benefits of Aadhaar seeding in their accounts. Consequently, a considerable number of pensioners (about 84 percent) have got seeded their Aadhaar numbers with their pension accounts & PPOs and they are  in position to avail the facility of getting their life authenticated on line by using digital life certification(Jeevan Pramaan) in case they desired to do so.
·         Life Certificate format for the pensioner has been modified and provision for acknowledgement by the bank has been introduced.  Further, the bank has to mention submission of Life Certificate by the pensioner in the payment scrolls to CPAO to enable monitoring of the same. This year to avoid the hardship to pensioners in interacting with bank branches due to demonetization, the last date of submission of Life Certificate has been extended to 15th Jan 2017.
·         As a step towards making pensioner better informed and empowered, facility of informing pensioner through SMS of receipt of fresh Pension Payment Order/Revision Cases from the PAO at CPAO and sending Pension Payment Order (Special Seal Authority) to banks for arranging payment has been provided to those pensioners who have provided their mobile numbers.  As a result, pensioner can easily track the movement of their pension case.  This is in addition to already available facility on the website of CPAO (www.cpao.nic.in) to pensioner to track their pension processing status at CPAO by providing 12 digit PPO number. 
·         CPAO in now running fully functional Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) and a pensioner can lodge grievance through telephone on Toll Free No, website, e-mail, letters or personal visit.  The queries and grievances of pensioners are attended on highest priority by qualified personnel. In 2015-16; total 59,902 grievances received & settled whereas in 2016-17, till Nov, 2016 total 52,125 grievances have been received & settled.
·          Link to Jeevan Pramaan Portal has been provided on CPAO website to enable pensioners to use facility of Digital Life Certificate. For retiring employees, a link has been established with Bhavishya Portal of DP&PW to enable them to track status of their pension cases even before the case reaches CPAO.  A link to CPENGRAMS (Centralized Pension Grievance Redress and Monitoring System) has also been provided so as to enable pensioners to lodge and track their grievances on CPENGRAMS.
·          Download facility of Special Seal Authority (PPO) from CPAO’s website by using login and password provided by CPAO has been given to pensioners.  Consequently, they need not separately approach CPAO to provide copies of their SSAs issued to the banks.  This facility ensures digital presence and availability of records for pensioner.
·         All Banks have confirmed payment of revision pension & arrears of Pension for 7th CPC for about 9.10 Lakhs pensioners.  CPAO is also compiling the information separately based upon the e-scrolls received from banks.
·         CPAO conducted internal audit of 30 units during 2015-16 which exceeded the previous three years total combined number of audits.  The total 414 pending internal audit paras have been settled till Nov, 2016. (highest so far)

(v)      Based on the suggestion made by the Department, SEBI has reduced the notice period for an OFS transaction from T-2 to T-1 (T being the transaction day). This will help in minimizing the possibility of price hammering between the notice day and the transaction day and suitably protecting the interest of retail investors by providing them sufficient time to participate in the OFS transaction.
 
(b)              Restructuring and re-naming the Department to comprehensively manage the Government’s investment in PSUs as DIPAM
 
(i)            The Union Finance Minister has underlined the need for adopting a comprehensive approach to efficiently manage its investment in CPSEs as highlighted in Para 89 of his Budget Speech of 2016-17 as below:
 
“We will adopt a comprehensive approach for efficient management of Government investment in CPSEs by addressing issues such as capital restructuring, dividend, bonus shares, etc. The Department of Disinvestment is being re-named as the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM)”
 
 
(ii)         In the light of the announcement made, the Department has been  re-named as Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) which is in line with focus of the Government on management of its investment in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) for accelerating economic development as well as augmenting the Government resources for higher expenditure. It also underlines the Government’s recognition of its investment in CPSEs as an important asset for accelerating economic growth and commitment to efficient use of its resources to achieve a better return on its investment in CPSEs.
 
(iii)       As announced in the Budget, guidelines on “Capital Restructuring of CPSEs” have also been issued by this Department on 27th May, 2016. These guidelines supersede all previously issued guidelines by various Ministries/Departments from time to time and comprehensively deal with the inter-related issues on payment of dividend, buy back of shares, issue of bonus shares and splitting of shares. The focus of these guidelines is on optimum utilization of funds by CPSEs/Government to spur economic growth.

XI.      Capitalization of Public Sector Banks (PSBs)
 
As of now, the PSBs are adequately capitalized and meeting all the Basel III and RBI norms.  However, the Government of India wants to adequately capitalize all the banks to keep a safe buffer over and above the minimum norms of Basel III.  Therefore, Government has estimated how much capital will be required this year and in the next three years till FY 2019.  If the internal generated profit is excluded which is going  to be available to PSBs (based on the estimate of average profit of the last three years), the capital requirement of extra capital for the next four years up to FY 2019 is likely to be about Rs.1,80,000 crore.  This estimate is based on credit growth rate of 12% for the current year and 12 to 15% for the next three years depending on the size of the bank and their growth ability.  It is also presumed that the emphasis on PSBs financing will reduce over the years by development of vibrant corporate debt market and by greater participation of Private Sector Banks.
 
Out of the total requirement, the Government of India proposes to make available Rs.70,000 crore out of Budgetary Allocations for four years as per the figures given below:

The President of India Shri Pranab Mukherjee launched the Pulse Polio  programme for 2017 by administering polio drops to children less than  five years old, at the Rahstrapati Bhawan, in the presence of the Union  Minister of Health & Family Welfare Shri J P Nadda and Ministers of  State (Health) Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste and Smt. Anupriya Patel, here  today. Tomorrow is the National Immunization Day. Around 17 crore  children of less than five years across the country will be given polio  drops as part of the drive of Government of India to sustain polio  eradication from the country.
Speaking at the function on the eve of the National Immunization Day,  the Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare Shri J P Nadda  stated that polio-free certification of the entire South-East Asia  Region of WHO including India on 27th March 2014 is a huge  accomplishment in the history of public health. He added that as the  risk of importation still persists from remaining three countries  (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria) where poliovirus is still  circulating, the need still persists for the country to maintain the  population immunity and sensitive surveillance till global polio  eradication happens. This is maintained through National and Sub  National Polio rounds along with sustained high quality polio  surveillance.
The Health Minister added that ‘We are conducting continuous polio  vaccination at the international borders with India. A travel advisory  has also been issued to vaccinate all travelers who are travelling  between India and eight other countries. Also, an Emergency Preparedness  and Response Plan (EPRP) is in place under which Rapid Response Teams  (RRT) have been formed in all States/UTs to respond urgently to any  importations of poliovirus”. Shri Nadda said that to provide double  protection to our children, Government of India has also introduced the  injectable Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) into its routine immunization  program.
Shri Nadda pointed out that India has reduced under-5 mortality rate  from 75 per 1000 live births in 2005 to 45 per 1000 in 2014 as per  recent SRS estimates. Noting that immunization is one of the key  interventions in reducing child deaths in country, he said that to  expand the scope of immunization in country, Rotavirus virus vaccine has  been introduced as part of the UIP last year and the Ministry is soon  to introduce Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine that will help to reduce the  burden of diarrhea, pneumonia and meningitis, and a countrywide  campaign with Measles-Rubella vaccine in phased manner. Shri Nadda said  that the innovative initiative of the Government, Mission Indradhanush,  launched in 2014 has strengthened our immunization coverage and ensured  that all vaccines reach our targeted beneficiaries even in remotest  areas.
The Union Health Minister applauded the efforts of the thousands of  volunteers, frontline workers, health officials across the states and  development partners for their tireless efforts in keeping the country  polio-free.
Also present at the function were Shri C K Mishra, Secretary (HFW),  senior officers of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and  representatives of development partners.

                 Non-Communicable diseases (NCDs) which are Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) such as heart attacks and stroke, Diabetes, Chronic Respiratory Diseases (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases and Asthma) and Cancer inter alia account for over 60% of all mortality in India.  Of these, nearly 55% are premature mortality. This imposes a financial and social cost on families and the country.  According to the World Economic Forum, India stands to lose $ 4.58 trillion (Rs 311.94 trillion between 2012 and 2030 due to non-communicable diseases.
Since these conditions do not exhibit symptoms until complications set in, it is essential to detect them early.  Early detection of NCDs not only enables onset of treatment but prevents high financial costs and suffering.  For some cancers, survival rates are good when they are detected and treated in the early stages.  Screening for these conditions, which can be undertaken at the level of the sub centre or Primary health Centres helps early detection and also serves to raise health awareness among people to lead healthy lifestyles.  Given that primary health care, including prevention and health promotion can lead to improved health and developmental outcomes at much lower cost, the Ministry is now expanding access to prevention and primary care services,
As part of the National Health Mission, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is launching population based prevention, screening and control programme for five common non-communicable diseases, namely Hypertension, Diabetes, and Cancers of oral cavity, breast and cervix. On February 4th coinciding with World Cancer Day, Union Health and Family Welfare Minster is expected to launch the programme. The training of frontline workers- the ASHA and ANM which will be initiated and in some sub-centres, population based screening will also start. Detailed protocols for treatment, referrals and follow-up on these disease conditions will be provided. 
In the first phase, the population based screening component will be rolled out in 100 districts in 32 states and UTs with about 1000 sub-centres undertaking screening before March 31st of this year. ASHAs will also be capturing information on major risk factors so that persons at risk could be counselled on leading healthy lifestyles to prevent onset of NCDs. In subsequent phases, Chronic Obstructive Respiratory diseases will be included and the programme will be scaled up to cover other districts. Support to states will also be provided for community health promotion and prevention efforts, and referral and treatment.

“We  have to aim to ensure “zero tolerance” with regard to risk of fire.  With this aim in the focus, we have to align all our efforts and  converge to achieve this goal.” This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union  Minister of Health and Family Welfare while inaugurating a National  Workshop on ‘Life and Fire Safety in Healthcare Facilities in India’,  here today. The workshop wasjointly organized by Ministry of Health and  All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi with active  participation of School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi, Delhi  Fire Services, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), New Delhi  and Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee. The main  objective of the workshop was to sensitize the hospital administrators  and engineering heads about important issues related to life and fire  safety in healthcare buildings.  
Speaking  at the function, ShriNadda said that sensitization towards fire safety  is key to preventing any untoward incident in hospitals. “The dos and  don’ts must be understood first and should be strictly followed. We must  also make sure that it goes down to every level,” ShriNadda added. The  Health Minister further said that doctors and engineering staff should  be fully aware of their role towards fire and life safety. “Our nurses  and doctors are the first responders in such an eventuality. In fact,  doctors and nurses would provide the guidance and support if patients  are to be moved and where they have to be moved considering the  condition of patients,” ShriNadda stated.  
Laying  stress on having safe evacuation during emergencies,ShriNadda said that  it has been noticed that corridors, staircases are not properly  maintained to provide safe egress, sometimes emergency doors are locked  even when patients are in a position to move out. “This is fundamental  but often ignored, due to security reasons. Hospital administrations  should resolve this problem in consultation with security experts.  Please ensure that access and egress is not compromisedand proper fire  escape routes and measures are in place especially in operation theatres  and ICUs so that patients inside these rooms can be evacuated properly  during emergencies,” ShriNadda elaborated. 
ShriNadda  also emphasized on the need for training and capacity building among  the hospital staff especially doctors, nurses and attendants so that  they can undertake routine assessments of emerging risks, including  those arising due to alterations and also conduct audits through  internal technical staff.ShriNadda also directed the officials of the  participating Institutions/Hospitals to develop time bound fire safety  action plan of the building/block of their Hospital/Institution. He  further instructed them to undertake quarterly fire drills so that the  hospital staff is sensitized and is aware of their responsibility.  ShriNadda also asked the participants to conduct fire audits regularly  which will be monitored by the Ministry.  
The  workshop was attended by Heads of 23 Hospitals/ Institutes under the  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and their concerned officers.  A mock drill was also conducted in the premises of AIIMS, New Delhi.  In  the workshop the participants got a comprehensive understanding of the  scope of life and fire safety in healthcare buildings in terms of best  practices as well as applicable codes and standards by participants. 
Also  present at the function were DrArun Panda, Additional Secretary (HFW),  ShriSanjeeva Kumar, Addl. Secy (HFW), Dr B D Athani, Special DGHS, Dr.  M.C.Misra, Director AIIMS, New Delhi

With  the aim of providing free residential facilities to attendants of the  poor patient who do not belong to Delhi, the Union Minister for Health  & Family Welfare, Shri J P Nadda inaugurated the ‘Dharamshala  complex’ at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (RML) Hospital, here today.  The complex is a 35 bedded facility having single, twin and dormitory  rooms with a floor reserved for women. The complex has been constructed  with a total outlay of approx. ₹ 6.15 cr and offers free communication  facilities for the attendants. Care taker, Security and Sanitation  services are available round the clock. Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste,  Hon’ble MoS (Health & Family Welfare) was also present on the  occasion.
 Speaking  at the function, Shri Nadda said that this hospital attracts patients  from the city and from neighboring states with unwavering belief that  they will get best of services available in the country. “RML has been  successful in balancing the quality and quantity while delivering  services to the poor people,” Shri Nadda added. 
Laying  emphasis on services to be delivered at the complex, Shri Nadda said  that the services at the complex should be regularly inspected and  monitored. “We erect the hardware but not pay much attention to the  software part. The hospital should look at ways and means of making the  facilities at the complex self-sustaining,’ Shri Nadda said. The Health  Minister further stated that the facility should ensure proper  sanitation and directed the officials to personally monitor this aspect  at the facility.
Referring  to the ICT based application ‘Mera Aspataal (My Hospital)’ that  captures patients’ feedback about their experience in the health  facilities on the services that they received or sought to receive, Shri  Nadda said that the Ministry is seeking the feedback of people  digitally to improve the quality of services at the health centres.  “Patient satisfaction is the ultimate test for assessing quality of  services provided by a healthcare facility and we are now making a  paradigm shift by seeking their views on quality of experience in a  public healthcare facility. This will help us improving the experience  of people at a health facility,” Shri Nadda elaborated.
Earlier,  Shri Nadda reviewed the preparedness of Dr RML Hospital to deal with  the cases of H1N1 influenza. The Health Minister added, “In winter  season, the H1N1 influenza cases generally show a rise. Today visit is  to review the preparation of the hospital for this. Adequate stocks of  medicines, testing kits and medical equipment are in place and we are  fully geared up to handle H1N1 influenza.” During  the visit the Health Minister expressed satisfaction over the  preparation and availability of designated beds, medical equipment,  medicines, testing kits, personal protective equipment and masks.

On  the personnel initiative of DG, SSB Mrs. Archana Ramasundaram, it is  first time that the Officers of the rank of Dy. Commandant and above  posted in various Sector Headquarters, Frontier Headquarters and Force  Headquarter New Delhi are going to Border Out Posts (BOPs) in far-flung  areas on Indo-Nepal & Indo-Bhutan Borders and to J&K and Naxal  affected areas to celebrate 68th Republic Day with National fervor.           
On  this occasion the officers will also convey the message of DG, SSB to  the force personnel and public present in the functions. The DG also  said that this occasion will help in establishing a healthy relationship  with the border population. This national festival shall be celebrated  in a manner that better relationship could be ensured between border  population and SSB to strengthen integrity and unity of the country. 
The idea behind this initiative is also to establish  direct  communication between the officers of headquarters and the jawans  posted at remote locations on the borders. This endeavor  will  also ensure that senior officers appreciate the problems of jawans and  instill confidence in them that the DG and the FHQ is sensitive towards  their problems and making all out efforts to provide them better  facilities. 
On  this occasion the DG, SSB has also called upon the force personnel to  follow the motto of SSB “Service, Security & Brotherhood” and strive  for security of the border population and keep the national flag flying  high and achieve new heights.

The Advisory Committee of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) met here today to discuss the road ahead for the 10-point agenda for Disaster Risk Reduction, outlined by the Prime minister, Shri Narendra Modi. 
 The Prime Minister had listed the agenda during his  inaugural speech at the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk  Reduction (AMCDRR) 2016, which was held in New Delhi in November last  year. The all-inclusive agenda presents a holistic approach to disaster  risk management and addresses a whole range of issues, from community  preparedness to use of technology and international cooperation. The  Prime Minister’s 10-point agenda on DRR is - 
 
1.      All development sectors must imbibe the principles of disaster risk management.
2.      Work towards risk coverage for all-starting from poor households to SMEs to multi-national corporations to nation states.
3.      Encourage greater involvement and leadership of women in disaster risk management.
4.      Invest in risk mapping globally.  For mapping risks related to hazards like earthquakes we have accepted  standards and parameters.
5.      Leverage technology to enhance the efficiency of our disaster risk management efforts.
6.      Develop a network of universities to work on disaster issues.
7.      Utilise the opportunities provided by social media and mobile technologies.
8.      Build on local capacity and initiative.
9.      Opportunity to learn from a  disaster must not be wasted. After every disaster there are papers on  lessons that are rarely applied.
10.  Bring about greater cohesion in international response to disasters.
  
Shri R.K. Jain, Member, NDMA, welcomed the members  of the Committee and briefly explained the role of the Committee in  achieving the goals of DRR. NDMA also made a presentation underlining  the institutional, structural and operational framework for Disaster  Management in the country. It also highlighted the projects that are  underway along with projects that have already been completed. 
 
A detailed discussion on the need for multi-hazard  preparedness, given the fact that a primary event brings with it an  increased risk of secondary events, such as landslides following an  earthquake, was done. The need for sharing of resources, leveraging  technology, ensuring last mile connectivity, sharing best practices and  success stories and involving the common man was also discussed.
 
Underlining that the implementation of guidelines  and advisories was a major problem, the Committee members emphasised on  the role of fixing accountability of stakeholders in case of a disaster  and gaps in response, preparedness and information dissemination, both  in terms of Early Warning Messages and community awareness. This will  help in improving coordination thus enabling better response.
 
The importance of strengthening communities to act  as effective first responders during disasters was underlined. It was  further added that academia should be used to spread awareness and more  and more institutes and universities should offer courses in disaster  education.
 
The 15-member Advisory Committee consisting of  experts from various areas of Disaster Management and allied disciplines  has representatives from academia, governments, Non-Governmental  Organisations (NGOs) and civil society members. The members of the  Committee are: Ms. Sushma Iyengar of Kutch Abhiyan; Secretary General of  the Indian Red Cross; Shri P.P. Shrivastava, Former Special Secretary  to Govt. of India and Former Member North Eastern Council; Dr. S.K.  Nanda, Former Additional Chief Secretary to the Govt. of Gujarat; Dr.  R.K. Bhandari, Chairman, Forum on Engineering Intervention of Disaster  Mitigation; Prof. C.V.R. Murthy, IIT Jodhpur; Prof. Arun Kumar Sarma,  IIT Guwahati; Lt. Gen. (Retd.) A.K. Puri, PVSM, AVSM, Former DGBR; Dr.  Y.S. Ramakrishna, Ex-Director, CRIDA (ICAR); Dr. L.S. Rathore, Former  DG, IMD; Sh. Arjun Katoch, Former Chief Field Coordination Support  Section, UNOCHA; Sh. Ranjan Dwivedi, former DGP, UP and Advisor (Cyber  Security), Ministry of Power; Sh. T.P. Singh, Advisor, DietY, Govt. of  India, Dr. Ajay Mathur, DG, TERI and Sh. Chewang Norphel, Chief Project  Officer of the Leh Nutrition Project Housing Colony.
 
NDMA  Members, Shri Kamal Kishore, Lt. Gen. N.C. Marwah (Retd.) and Dr. D.N.  Sharma also attended the meeting and provided valuable inputs.

The  Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had put all its machinery on action on  the eve of New Year when drugs are widely used in rave parties. Acting  on this task, Delhi Zonal Unit of Narcotics Control Bureau had put its  focus on the foreigners coming to Delhi through IGI Airport to supply  drugs in Delhi NCR.  On the  intervening night of December 30-31, 2016, Delhi Zonal Unit of Narcotics  Control Bureau intercepted a Brazilian woman namely, Joseane Da Silva  Antunes age-38 years old at IGI, Airport travelling by Etihad Airways  from Sao Paulo to New Delhi via Abu Dhabi on specific information of  bearing swallowed cocaine capsules. The woman was taken to Safdarjung  Hospital for medical examination. During medical examination, it was  confirmed that some foreign objects are concealed inside her stomach.  The woman was admitted in the hospital and since then she has extracted  total 65 capsules of drugs so far.
Acting  further on intelligence source, on January 4, 2017, Delhi Zonal Unit of  NCB intercepted an Afghan national namely Mohammad Qasem age-50 years  at IGI, Airport travelling by Kam Air from Herat to New Delhi via Kabul  with information of having swallowed Heroin capsules. The suspect was  taken to Safdarjung Hospital for medical examination. During medical  examination, the accused has since then extracted 90 capsules of drugs. 
Both  the accused are still under medical supervision. Necessary legal  proceedings would be carried out only after their discharge. They are  likely to extract more such capsules.
 The  agency is still on the lookout for more such swallowers coming to  Delhi. This is a big jolt to the drug traffickers and the users of the  drugs. All persons involved in the racket are being identified and  action is being planned accordingly. The swallow method is not easy to  detect as there is no mechanism to identify any concealment inside body.  Only after applying profiling techniques, the suspects are identified.

A  delegation of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh's Industrial Unit, ""Bharatiya  Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh"", held a meeting with Union Minister of State  (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER),  MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and  Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and sought his intervention for  grant of one-time relaxation from the ceiling of 5% for compassionate  appointments in the Ministry of Defence. The delegation also requested  the Minister to issue directions to expedite the follow-up  pertaining  to LTC cases pending in the DoPT. 
The  members of the delegation sought to draw Dr Jitendra Singh’s attention  to an earlier meeting with him wherein they had brought to his notice  that there is 5.85 lakh sanctioned strength of Defence Civilians, but  the existing strength is only 3.98 lakh as mentioned in the report of  7th Central Pay Commission (CPC). Thus, there is a deficiency of 1.87  lakh civilian manpower and there are about 20,000 aspirants who are  seeking appointment on compassionate grounds. The members of the  delegation recalled that Dr Jitendra Singh had given a positive response  to them and subsequently also written to the Defence Minister to take  cognizance of the issue. 
As  per an OM of the Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT), there  is a provision to give compassionate appointment to one of the  dependants for the survival of the family in case the employee  unfortunately dies during the service period leaving the family behind.  But the provision for such appointment is limited to 5% of the  vacancies, as a result of which, according to the members of delegation,  a large number of wards are kept waiting for appointment on  compassionate ground because of the ceiling. 
The  delegation referred to an earlier letter written by Dr Jitendra Singh  to the Minister of Defence, Shri Manohar Parrikar wherein the former had  requested for intervention by the Defence Ministry so that the DoPT  could accordingly proceed in the matter. They requested Dr Jitendra  Singh to take up the issue once again with the Ministry of Defence so  that their demand could be addressed. Dr Jitendra Singh assured the  members of delegation that he would again seek the views of the Minister  of Defence and try to work out whatever feasible.

Ministry of HUPA rules out any amendments to RERA; plot size of 500 sq.mt not to be changed
 
Implementation of RERA discussed with States; Most of the States to notify rules soon
 
 Minister  of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu today  urged the States and Union Territories to rise to the occasion and  implement the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act ,2016 from  the first of May this year, as proposed in the Act. He addressed a  meeting of Chief Secretaries and senior officials of States and UTs  convened by the Ministry of HUPA to discuss implementation of the Real  Estate Act.
 Shri  Venkaiah Naidu said “ Real Estate Act is one of the most consumer  friendly laws passed by the Parliament and States have no power to  dilute its provisions. This law, which was widely welcomed and  appreciated benefits both the buyers and sellers of real estate  properties besides enhancing the credibility of the sector. There is lot  of hope and expectation from this act by all the stakeholders. There  are some media reports that some States have diluted some provisions of  the Act in the Rules notified by them. States don’t have such powers and  I hope such reports are not true. Today, I want to make it clear that  any compromise with the spirit of the Act will have serious implications  including public outcry. Whoever does so will have to face the public  outcry. I expect the States and UTs to rise to the occasion and ensure  implementation of the Act from May this year as proposed in the Act by  taking necessary measures in time”. 
Later,  various aspects of the Real Estate Act were discussed in detail.  Responding to the views and suggestions made, Dr.Nandita Chatterjee,  Secretary(HUPA) clarified that no amendments to the Act would be  considered at this stage since full implementation of the Act would  begin only in May this year when Real Estate Regulatory Authorities and  Appellate Tribunals would become functional. 
Dr.Chatterjee  also clarified that the minimum plot size of 500 sq.mt proposed in the  Act for registration of projects with Regulatory Authorities was arrived  at after several rounds of discussions by the Parliamentary Committees  and in the Parliament and it can’t be altered now. She said that the cut  off date for the ongoing projects that have not received completion  certificates for including under the purview of the Real Estate Act  would be May first this year, from when the full Act comes into effect. 
Regarding  other issues raised by the States, the Ministry officials stated that  necessary clarity for the purpose of implementation of the Act can be  given in the Rules  to be notified by the States/UTs, without violating the spirit of the Act. These include stilt parking to be used as garage.
Responding  to the issue of excluding balconies from the definition of carpet area,  it was explained that it posed no problems as costing could be  accordingly informed to the buyers. Interim Regulatory Authorities have  been proposed in the Act so that they could put in place necessary  institutional mechanisms for full fledged Regulatory Authorities could  become functional from the first of May this year, it was explained. 
The  Ministry has agreed to come out with a template for Website to be made  operational for disclosure of a range of information about the projects  as mandated under the Act. Any expenditure incurred by the promoters on  development of land could be included as part of the cost of land,  States were told. 
During  the review, it revealed that Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh,  Chattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala,  Mizoram, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry would notify the Real  Estate Rules next month.

                Shri M Venkaiah Naidu, Minister for Information & Broadcasting has said that Digital Radio provided a unique opportunity for all the stakeholders both public and private broadcasters to carry forward the vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister to achieve Digital and Connectivity Revolution in the Country. Digital Radio technology would provide listeners with significantly improved audio quality and service reliability at an affordable price. The Minister mentioned this during his address at the Digital Radio for All Round Table Conference organised by Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) along with Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL) here today.

            Elaborating further, Shri Naidu said that it was an opportune moment for automotive manufacturers and retailers to incorporate Digital Radio systems in vehicles that provided consumers with significantly improved audio quality and service reliability at an affordable price. This would enable the scaling up and adoption of this new Digital Technology. The Digital Radio provides benefits to all the stakeholders, including Listeners, Manufacturers, Broadcasters and Regulators.

Regarding achievements of All India Radio in adopting Digital Radio Technology, Shri Naidu mentioned that All India Radio has already completed the technical installation and upgradation of 37 powerful transmitters in the first phase of Digitization of Radio Broadcast, a project unparalleled in the world today. This would ensure reduced electric power consumption for all digital transmissions, saving All India Radio and taxpayers significant transmission cost in the future. He added that All India Radio has re-invented itself through its Digital Transmitters based on the International ITU standard Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM).
Emphasizing on the need for the Traffic advisory services on National Highways, Shri Naidu said that the next phase of this service through AIR FM Transmitters needs to be digitised based on the ITU standards to exploit its full potential. The service would offer multiple radio program, detailed and multi-lingual on-demand traffic & travel information and emergency warning services.
From the Listeners perspective the Digital Transmission would provide Crystal clear and better-than-FM sound quality, enhanced program choice, free access to textual news, sports, travel and weather information from the Internet in many languages simultaneously and would enable the transmission of emergency warning for immediately alerting the population in case of pending disasters.
From a commercial perspective, the system provides audiences with receivers at an affordable price as well as an attractive package of benefits which include wider range of services, easier tuning and selection of programming, improved stereo and surround sound in cars amongst others.

From a technical perspective, a key and a revolutionary feature of DRM is the ability to select from a range of Transmission Modes. This allows the Broadcaster to balance or exchange bit-rate capacity, signal robustness, transmission power and coverage. The DRM broadcasting system is specifically designed to allow the new digital transmission to co-exist with the current analogue broadcasts.

Secretary, I&B, Shri Ajay Mittal has said the North East Film Festival (NEFF), Fragrances from the North East served as a unique window to the films, food, culture and handicrafts diversity of North East and enabled the cultural amalgamation of the region with the rest of the country. By organizing the current edition of the festival at Pune, the objective was to sensitise people from other regions to the culture of the North East as envisaged in the “Ek Bharat Shreshta Bharat” programme of the Hon’ble Prime Minister. A decision had now been taken to organize the festival in different cities every year as part of the “Ek Bharat Shreshta Bharat” vision. Shri Mittal stated this while delivering his address at the inaugural ceremony of the festival at National Film Archive of India (NFAI), Pune today.

Highlighting some of the initiatives taken by the Ministry of I&B to promote cinema in the North East, Shri Mittal said the focus has been to provide multiple platforms through workshops, film festivals, interactive sessions and special screenings at IFFI focusing on the region. As part of the new initiative, the Ministry sponsored 10 film makers from the North East for the first time to attend the IFFI in Goa. The objective was to give an opportunity to young and emerging film makers from the region to interact with the foreign delegates attending IFFI and also explore collaborations with international film production houses, ensuring wider reach and audience for NE films. The Directorate of Film Festivals organized a special session on the North East film industry at the Indywood Film Carnival in Hyderabad. It also took the initiative to organize the first edition of the IFFI chapter of North East in Imphal in December 2016 in partnership with Manipur Film Development Corporation.

Regarding the excellence of the films of the region, Shri Mittal said that the National Film Awards and Indian Panorama over the years had been discovering and honouring the talents from the North East, specially in languages which were not specified other than the Schedule VIII of the Constitution. Some of the films had won accolades in the International Film Festivals all over the world. The Indian Panorama had eight films selected from the North East region this year.
 
During his address, the Secretary complimented the students of Pune from the North East region who had taken the pain and efforts to participate in the three-day festival by showcasing the culture and cuisine of the region. Taking into account, the enthusiastic response from the city, Shri Mittal assured that the festival and such screenings would be organized henceforth regularly in Pune.

The festival is also screening “Loktak Lairambi” which is part of the Indian Panomara selection. The film has already been making waves in the International film circuit after being premiered in Busan and has now been selected for forthcoming Berlin film festival. 
 
The three-day festival is being held at NFAI campus, from 28th to 30th January.

Elaborating further, Shri Mittal said, “This is a one-of-its-kind project in the world, wherein the Government is spending huge amount of money towards the aspect of film preservation, in order to make rich filmic heritage available for the future generations to come. The condition of about 1,32,000 film reels at NFAI would be assessed and necessary measures would be taken to prolong their life. Each film reel will be tracked and monitored through RFID tagging, during the first phase”. 
 
On the sidelines of the occasion, Shri Mittal also launched NFAI’s initiative of digitization of non-filmic material. Secretary said, “this is a step in the direction of Government’s Digital India initiative, wherein non-filmic heritage of the country would be digitized, restored and made available to the people at large”. NFAI has been the custodian of a large number of film ancillary material like posters, photos, song booklets, pamphlets, press clippings, slides / transparencies, glass negatives etc, which would be digitized and restored during the process. 
 

Secretary I&B reviewing the Digitisation process
 
NFHM is the prestigious mission of Government of India, for preservation, conservation, digitization and restoration of rich cinematic heritage of the country. National Film Archive of India (NFAI) is the nodal organization for the implementation of this project. Rs.597.41 crore has been allotted towards implementation of the project, which was kick-started with launch of the first phase of the mission, Film Condition Assessment.

                Cable Subscribers in Phase III urban areas, who have not yet taken  Set Top Boxes, are advised to obtain the same from the MSO/Cable  Operators in their areas immediately, failing which they would not be  able to watch TV services through Cable TV Networks after 31st January,  2017.
It is brought to the notice of all concerned that Ministry of  I&B would not grant any extension beyond 31st January, 2017 to  switch off analog signals in Phase III urban areas. In this connection,  Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs have been requested recently to  ensure that the Authorized Officer get acquainted with their powers and  specified rules to enforce them against defaulters if they continue to  carry analog signal in Phase III urban areas after 31st January, 2017.
The Ministry had issued instructions to all the Broadcasters, Multi  System Operators (MSOs) and Local Cable Operators (LCOs) to ensure that  no analog signals are transmitted over the cable networks in Phase III  urban areas after 31st January, 2017. ""Authorized officers"" under Sec 11  of the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act can seize the equipment of  the MSOs/Cable Operators, if they continues to carry analog signal in  Phase III urban areas after 31st January, 2017.
On account of court proceedings, Ministry of Information &  Broadcasting had earlier given time up to 31st January, 2017 to switch  over to digital mode of transmission in Cable TV Networks in Phase III  urban areas.

                Shri Venkaiah Naidu, Minister for Information & Broadcasting has  said that students aspiring to become journalists in future must ensure that news and views are not mixed. In order to be objective, every budding young journalist should have an open mind to acquire maximum knowledge to present the perspective in an objective manner. He urged students to keep abreast with the latest developments, new technology and new modes of communication and should inculcate a habit of reading to remain relevant and effective. He also called upon IIMC to strive for journalism courses in all Indian languages to cater to the communication needs of the citizens all across the country. The Minister stated this while inaugurating the First PG Diploma course in Urdu Journalism, 67th Diploma course in Development Journalism and the launch of IIMC Journal “Communicator”, here today at Shastri Bhawan.

Speaking about the changing paradigm in communication, the Minister said that Social Media has broken the boundaries of time and space in communication.  It was a pre-requisite today for budding journalists to be social media savvy and to have a watchful eye about the public perception on issues of local and international importance.
Emphasizing on the training methodology, Shri Naidu said that in the current scenario, it was important to include Case studies and practical exposure as a part of curriculum for learning, practising and applying new concepts. He also stressed the need to impart an outlook to budding journalists, and communicators that is rooted in strong ethical values.
Complimenting IIMC on the new PG Diploma course in Urdu Journalism, Shri Naidu said that Urdu journalism was an important and integral part of media and communication landscape of our country which played an important role in Freedom Struggle movement. Elaborating further, the Minister emphasized on the critical role played by Maulana Azad’s newspaper Al-Hilal which espoused the cause of Hindu-Muslim unity and strengthened the inclusive ideals of Indian nationalism during the Freedom Struggle movement. He also highlighted the important role played by newspapers like Naqeeb e-Hamdard, Pratap, Milap, Quami Awaaz, Zameendar, Hindustan in spreading the ideals of nationalism amongst the Indian youth.
Regarding the expanding Media & Entertainment sector, the Minister highlighted the vast requirement of skilled personnel in the sector in the country.  He referred the prominent role being played by the Government’s Skill India Initiative for upgrading skills under multiple disciplines. He added that the vision of this Government under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister was to bring Transformational changes in all sectors.  He complemented IIMC for playing a pivotal role in bridging the skill gap currently prevailing in this domain as a premier academic institution in the country.
On the re-launch of IIMC Journal “Communicator”, the Minister said that the Journal will provide academicians, research scholars, and media practitioners a platform to publish their articles, case studies and research papers related to the field of mass communication encouraging a healthy exchange of innovative, unique and transformative ideas that can lay the foundations to the ‘communication paradigm of the future’. The journal ‘Communicator’ is one of the oldest Journals on mass communication, in publication since 1965. It started as Quarterly Journal in 1965 and later became a yearly publication.

While inaugurating the 67th Development Journalism course, the Minister said India is today regaining the lost glory of being the Knowledge hub of the world. The Development Journalism course provided a great opportunity for understanding and appreciating each other’s culture, and developing bonds of friendship. He added that journalist scholars from various Developing Countries were unofficial Ambassadors of India who shall provide a link of brotherhood among different cultures through their writings.  The 67th batch of Development Journalism course at IIMC has 23 scholars (12 females and 11 males) from 19 different countries.

Shyam Benegal said  ""' a visit to the film museum should be an engrossing experience and we  should have a number of interactive sections, where viewers can watch  clips from classics, listen to rare recordings or learn about how cinema  was  made in the bygone era"".  
Veteran film makers  Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Krishna Swamy, noted cinematographer A K Bir,  former Director of National Film Archives of India, Suresh Chhabria,  film conservationist Shivendra Dungarpur, film critic Sanjit Narvekar,  DG, NCSM Anil Manekar and DG of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Vastu  Sangrahalay, Mumbai Sabyasachi Mukherjee and film curator Amrit Gangar  were among those who were present at the meeting.

Considering the issues arising out of stabilisation of  the Unified Portal for employers with UAN Based simplified Electronic  Challan cum Return filing system the remittance for the month of  December 2016 can be paid by 20th January 2017. 
The Portal was launched by EPFO on 23.12.2016, which  helps in submission of UAN based returns and challans. It has been  noticed that due to increased traffic on the portal, many employers have  faced some difficulty in upfront allotment of UAN, connectivity/login  issues, website slowing down and also unfamiliarity of the new  processes. The Statutory dues are to be paid by 15th of every month.

Union  Law, Justice and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday said the  government’s November 8 decision of demonetization had resulted in sharp  decline in terror funding,  hawala  trade, supari killings and human trafficking, particularly of young  girls as sex slaves, mainly from Nepal and the North East.
Indicating  that the government would not hesitate to take steps to widen the tax  base, he said that development was not possible without enlarging the  tax kitty. ``There is only about Rs.  Five lakh crore in the kitty of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for development and it needs to grow,’’ he said.
 
Addressing  a seminar, jointly organized by the Press Club of India, Indian Women  Press Corps and the Supreme Court Lawyers’ Conference, he said that a  new India, much stronger in its unity and integrity, was emerging,  transcending the barriers of caste, creed and religion.
 
Former  Chief Justice of India M. N. Venkatachaliah who presided over the  seminar on Fundamental Duties and Economic and Judicial Reforms stressed  upon social evolution and education of young minds who can build a  better India.
 
``Every  government comes and goes. Our government is transformative government  and tools of technology are actively aiding the good governance. There  are 110 crore Aadhar cards and 104 crore mobile connections today.  Digital governance means faster delivery and even poor and illiterate  people in rural areas are showing a new confidence in embracing the  digital technology which has given a new vision of hope,’’ the Law and  IT Minister said. He also cited examples of Imran Khan, a mathematics  teacher from a school in Alwar, Rajasthan whose mobile apps had  benefitted 40 lakh children and a woman  Satama  Devi, a beedi worker from Telangana who had learnt how to use Skype to  talk to her grandson in Dubai. ``People like these are change agents.  They believe in this new fast emerging India,’’ he said.
 
Mr.  Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Aadhar enabled bank payments through  smart phone would prove to be a ``game changer’’ and a tool of  empowerment. He said that out of 125 crore people only 3.7 crore pay  taxes and 99 lakh file Income Tax returns but have no taxable income,  two crore people show annual income of Rs. 6 lakh and only 24 lakh have  an annual income of Rs. 10 lakh and above.
 
Mr.  Prasad, himself an activist during JP movement, said the present  government has leaders who were all student activists from the days of  Emergency and reiterated that the commitment of the government for  independence of judiciary is complete.
Admitting  that there were issues of infrastructure and judicial appointments, he  said that 126 appointments in the higher judiciary were made in the past  two years which was the highest since 1999. He said that 131 High Court  judges had also been confirmed. 
 
``There  is meaningful cooperation between the government and the new Chief  Justice of India Justice Khehar and all concerns of judiciary will be  addressed,’’ he added. The Minister asserted that independence of  judiciary and media and individual liberty was sacrosanct for the  government. He said that accountability of political establishment was a  positive feature of the democracy. ``The strength of democracy lies in  bringing in positive changes like eliminating poll violence from Bihar  by the efforts of the Election Commission,’’ he said.
 
The  Law and IT Minister said that a panel, led by Justice Sri Krishna, had  been set up to give a report within three months on making India a hub  of arbitration.
Veteran  Congress leader Dr. Karan Singh, former Lok Sabha Secretary General  Subhash Kashyap, former Chief Election Commissioner S Y Qureshi, former  BSF chief Prakash Singh, former Governor A R Kohli, IWPC President  Sushma Ramachandran, lawyer-activist Ashok Arora  and PCI Secretary-General Vinay Kumar also participated in the seminar.

                Shri Kalraj Mishra said that the package  for MSME announced by Prime Minister has met the long term demand of the  MSME for increasing credit guarantee limit from Rs. 1 crore to Rs.2  crore. He said this in a letter thanking Prime Minister for the MSME  package announced by him in the speech on the eve of New Year. 
 
Shri Mishra said that it will be for the  first time that the credit guarantee will also be extended to Non  Banking Financial Companies which provides loans to Micro Small  Enterprises. The package envisages that banks and NBFCs would charge low  interest rate on these loans because Government is bearing a  substantial part of guarantee cost. Micro and Small Enterprises have  been facing liquidity and credit constraints in the last 2 months.  Increase of credit limit from 20% of project annual turnover to 25%  would substantially increase available credit to small industry by 25%.  He also stated that as per announcement working capital loans for Micro  and Small Enterprises would be increased from 20% of the project annual  turnover to 30% on the digital component of the turnover. This would  incentivize business to shift to digital payments systems.
 
Additionally Reserve Bank of India extended  the period of the system 60 days to 90 days beyond what is applicable  for the banks and financial institutions for recognition of a loan  account of MSMEs as not being NPA or substandard for loans smaller than  Rs. 1 crore. This measure would provide relief of Micro and Small  Enterprises in repayment of interest on working capital loans. RBI has  already advised banks on 29 December 2016 to provide additional working  capital limit to Micro and Small Enterprises borrowers to overcome  temporary difficulties consequent upon withdrawal of legal tender status  of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denomination notes. A few days back Government  has also announced that presenting income tax for small business up to  turnover Rs. 2 crore would be calculated at 6% on income from digital  transaction in place of 8% otherwise. This would reduce income tax  liability on such transaction by 25%. Subsequent to the announcement of  MSME package by the Prime Minister positive feedbacks are received from  the MSME sector.

Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the Union Minister of State for Minority Affairs (Independent Charge)  and Parliamentary Affairs said that the Centre, National Waqf Development Corporation (NAWADCO) and  Central Waqf Council  together have launched a campaign to utilise the Waqf properties for socio-economic-educational empowerment of  minority communities specially Muslims. The  Minority Affairs Ministry has been working on different strategies for  welfare of Muslim community which include protection and development of  Waqf properties, he added.
Shri Naqvi stated this while inaugurating All India  Waqf Conference in New Delhi today. He said that several States have  come forward for better utilisation of Waqf properties, for progress of  Muslims. Most states have been performing well but more needs to be done  by all the States and UTs. 
All States should constitute the three Member Tribunals, the Minister said further.  Shri  Naqvi said that all efforts are being made to ensure that all Waqf  Boards and their records across the country are computerised and  Minority Affairs Ministry has been providing all possible help to the  State Waqf Boards. The Computerisation of Waqf Boards and their  properties will help in ensuring transparency in functioning of Waqf  Boards
Appreciating all participants for their efforts in  ensuring that all auqafs under their charge are properly maintained,  controlled, he urged to use the income from such properties to achieve  the    laid objectives for which such auqafs were created.  He  urged them to extend their full cooperation in implementing the Waqf  Act, Lease Rules, relevant schemes etc., which will not only help in  computerization of all records but will also increase the income of the  Waqf Boards/Muttawallis.  During  the meetings, power point presentations on waqf issues were made by the  Ministry of Minority Affairs; Central Waqf Council; NAWADCO, Haryana,  Karnataka and Kerala State Waqf Boards and extensive deliberations were  held on all the items of agenda.
Speaking on the occasion Shri Ameising Luikham,the Secretary, Ministry  of Minority Affairs said  that Under  the provisions of the amended Waqf Act, 1995, the Ministry of Minority  Affairs notified the Waqf Properties Lease Rules on 3.6.14. These rules  provide for restriction on grant of lease in certain cases; procedure to  be followed for lease/registration/renewal of lease properties; rights  and obligations of the lessor and lessee etc. Based on the difficulties  faced by some State Waqf Boards in implementing the notified rules, some  amendments therein were modified on 25.8.2015. One  of the important provisions of the Act relate to framing of Waqf Rules  by the State/UT Governments. For assisting the State/UT Governments in  this regard, the Ministry of Minority Affairs prepared the relevant  model rules and provided copies thereof to all States/UTs on 18.7.16 for  consideration.  However, most states are yet to notify revised rules.  He hoped that constructive and positive results will emerge from today’s deliberations.
 
Earlier welcoming the gathering Shri Jaa-ne Aalam,J S in the Ministry outlined the agenda of the meeting.
Shri Ashok Pai, CEO, NAWADCO said that income of merely Rs.163 crores from huge Waqf properties shows that  steps  need to be taken to improve the management of Waqf properties.  Emphasising the effective implementation of Lease Rules under revised  Act, he promised to extend all possible help in developing the Waqf  properties. He said across the country 100 properties have been  identified and intentions received for developing 35 properties, so far.
 
The Secretary CWC, Shri Jamal Ahmad gave vote of thanks at the end of inaugural session.
 
Management of Waqf properties is a very important area of public policy.  The Waqf Act 1995 regulates the administration of Waqfs. The Ministry has also launched several schemes.  This  Conference has been organized to review the implementation of the  schemes for strengthening of Waqf Boards and computerization of records  as well as to review the functioning of the Waqf Act 1995.
To deal with complaints regarding Waqf properties,  one-man “Board of Adjudication” will be established soon at the Centre  level to be headed by a retired Supreme Court Justice or retired High  Court Chief Justice. Three-member Tribunals are being established in the  States. About 15-16 states have established these tribunals.
 The  conference will discuss various issues related to implementation of  amendments incorporated in the Waqf Act, 1995; Waqf Properties Lease  Rules, 2014; framing of Waqf Rules by the State/UT Governments; review  of progress under the schemes relating to grant of financial assistance  to the State Waqf Boards for computerization of Waqf  properties; strengthening of Waqf  Boards; and development of Waqf properties by National Waqf Development Corporation Ltd. (NAWADCO).    
 
Officials from about 20 States/UTs  are  participating in the Conference besides Officers from the Ministry,  NAWADCO, CWC and NMDFC. Those participating include  Assam,Chhatisgarh,Delhi,Haryana,Kerala,Madhya,Pudducheri,Orissa,Tamilnadu,Uttarakhand  and Uttar Pradesh  etc.

A  delegation of the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers met the Union  Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern  Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic  Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and sought intervention  by Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) for the clearance of  backlog in promotions. 
In  a memorandum submitted by the members of delegation, it was pointed out  that around 450 posts of Joint Commissioner / JAG level are lying  vacant, but there are no officers eligible to be promoted because  Recruitment Rules prescribe minimum residency of 5 years at Deputy  Secretary level as eligibility criteria. Officers up to 2007 batch have  already been promoted and therefore, they requested for relaxation of 9  months for gaining eligibility for the officers of 2017 batch who have  been left out. The members of delegation sought Dr Jitendra Singh’s  intervention so that the DoPT could take a holistic view of  circumstances and grant relaxation for promotion to JAG / JC-IT. 
Prominent  IRS officers who led the delegation included Shri Rajesh Menon from  Mumbai, Shri Anantharaman Aiyer from Delhi, Shri C.K. Singh and Shri  B.K. Singh.

Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North  Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances,  Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that the  Union Government led by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has taken  decisive steps against Pakistan sponsored terrorism and the two most  recent examples are the decision of Remonetization which has drastically  reduced terror related transactions, preceded by the military strike  inside the Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.
Addressing the 2nd Round-Table Conference on the subject of  “Countering Pakistan State Terror” organized by Global Counter Terrorism  Council (GCTC) here today, Dr Jitendra Singh said Pak sponsored  terrorism in the context of Jammu & Kashmir is a cumulative effect  of a series of misdoings of the past six decades. He said, if only the  first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had allowed the then Home Minister  Sardar Patel to handle J&K, the history of the Indian subcontinent  would have been different.
When the NDA Government took over on May 26, 2014, Dr Jitendra Singh  said, it bequeathed a huge baggage of cumulative liabilities from the  past. There was a feeling of pessimism all over the country, but within  two years, he said, not only the common man in India is feeling proud to  be an Indian, but the Indians settled abroad are also looking forward  for an opportunity to return to their motherland. This itself is a  vindication of the kind of redemption which the government under the  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has succeeded in bringing about in  just two-and-a-half years, he added.
As per the reports, Dr Jitendra Singh said, following Remonetization,  there is a 60% dip in terror related activities and 50% reduction in  terror-related Hawala transactions being funded by Pakistan. Not only  this, at least two printing press units in Pakistan which were printing  fake Indian currency and pumping into India have been compelled to shut  down, he added. Similarly, the incidents of stone-pelting in J&K  have also gone down drastically, he said.
Dr Jitendra Singh said, decisions like the surgical strike and  Remonetization have hit the “Achilles’ heel” of Pakistan and these are  some of the decisive steps which no government in the past dared to  take. He also referred to the Government’s stand on Baluchistan and  said, for the first time, the Indian forces have had the opportunity to  give befitting retaliatory response to every act of mischief from  Pakistan.
Dr Jitendra Singh reiterated that the Union Government follows a  policy of zero tolerance to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and will never  compromise with the honour and dignity of the security forces of India  or the sovereignty of the Republic of India.
Among the eminent panelists at the Round-Table Conference were noted  analyst Shri Sushil Pandita, former Foreign Secretary Shri Kanwal Sibal,  retired Vice-Chief of Army Staff Gen Phillip Campose, the Head Imam,  Imam Illiyasi and well known activist Shri Tarek Fatah.

Government  has laid down specific timeline for completing enquiry against officers  and members of All India Services (AIS) within a given deadline, in a  time-bound manner. Giving details about the DoPT (Department of  Personnel & Training) decision, Union Minister of State (Independent  Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO,  Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr  Jitendra Singh said that the AIS (D&A) Rules, 1969 have been amended  to provide specific timelines at different stages of the enquiry, with a  view to complete the disciplinary proceedings against the members of  All India Services in a time-bound manner.

As  per the amended rules, a time limit of six months has been fixed for  completion of departmental enquiry and submission of report. In case it  is not possible to complete the enquiry within six months for  justifiable reasons to be recorded in writing, additional time limit not  exceeding six months at one time can be granted by the Disciplinary  Authority, thereby ensuring accountability for completion of enquiry.  Further, 30 days’ timeline has been fixed for the delinquent officers to  give his representation to the charge-sheet which can be extended to  not more than 30 days by the Disciplinary Authority and, in any case, no  extension will be provided beyond 90 days. Similarly, a period of 15  days has been provided to send a representation on the advice of UPSC  regarding the penalty to be imposed on the delinquent officer and for  such representation also, no extension will be provided beyond 45 days.

Dr  Jitendra Singh said, this amendment in the All India Service Rules has  been brought, in keeping with the spirit of the Union Government led by  the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, to bring in more accountability  and time-bound completion of every exercise in the course of governance.  The new amendment in the Rules, he said, will certainly strengthen the  culture of working within deadlines and timelines without showing any  slackness.

Meanwhile,  Chairperson, Uttar Pradesh State Social Welfare Board (UPSSWB), Dr (Ms)  Rupal Agarwal today called on Dr Jitendra Singh and provided her  assessment about the performance of the various functionaries in the  Board. She also brought to the notice of the Minister acts of omission  or commission by certain officials. Dr Jitendra Singh took a note of the  different issues raised by Dr Rupal Agarwal. He said, the Central  Government accords high priority to programmes relating to upliftment of  women, children and poor sections of the society. He also assured her  that the issues raised by her will be brought to the notice of the  concerned quarters.

Justice Dr. B. S. Chauhan, Chairman, Law Commission of India delivered the 15th  lecture of the Lecture Series initiated by the Central Vigilance  Commission (CVC) on ""Fair Investigation & Trail and Disciplinary  Proceedings"" here today. Justice Chauhan said that the fair  investigation is a part of Fundamental Rights under Articles 20 and 21  of the Constitution of India and for this reason the investigation must  be fair, transparent and judicious. Cross examination of witnesses is an  integral part of the principle of natural justice and evidence recorded  behind the back of the delinquent cannot be relied upon, he added.
Speaking  on the occasion, the Central Vigilance Commissioner Shri KV Chowdary  said the CVC has recently embarked upon an outreach programme that  includes going to schools and colleges and other forum to create  awareness among the people on how they can contribute in checking  corruption.
Chief  Vigilance Officers (CVOs) of Government Departments and various PSUs  and Senior Officers of the CVC were present on the occasion.

                The  Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North  Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions,  Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh chaired the 29th meeting of  the Standing Committee of Voluntary Agencies (SCOVA) here today. The SCOVA meeting is  organised by the Department of Pensions & Pensioners’ Welfare  (DoP&PW), Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions  and the last such meeting was held on June 27, 2016.
 
During  the meeting, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that today’s interaction was very  meaningful and stimulating, thus reflecting on the working of  DoP&PW. The Minister said that there are about 50-55 lakh pensioners  in the country and almost 88 percent of pension accounts have been  seeded to Aadhaar. He further said that minimum pension has been  increased to Rs. 9000 per person and ex-gratia amount has been increased  from Rs. 10-15 lakh to Rs. 25-35 lakh. 
 
Dr.  Jitendra Singh said that we need to put in place an institutionalized  mechanism to make good use of the knowledge, experience and efforts of  the retired employees which can help in the value addition to the  current scenario. Dr. Jitendra Singh said the retired employees are a  healthy and productive workforce for India and we need to streamline and  channelize their energies in a productive direction. We should learn  from the pensioners’ experience, he added. The Minister also said that  the DoP&PW should be reoriented in such a way that pensioners become  a part of nation building process.  
 
In the meeting, discussions were held on the action taken report of the 28th  SCOVA meeting. Further many issues related to pensioners were discussed  threadbare, such as revision of PPOs of pre-2006 pensioners, Health  Insurance Scheme for pensioners including those residing in non-CGHS  area, Special ""Higher"" Family Pension for widows of the war disabled  invalidated out of service, Extension of CGHS facilities to P&T  pensioners, issue relating to CGHS Wellness Centre, Dehradun etc. The  Minister directed for the prompt and time bound redressal of the  grievances of the pensioners and said that we should have sympathetic  attitude towards them. 
 
 The  Secretary, DoP&PW, Shri C. Viswanath and other senior officers of  the department were also present on the occasion. The meeting was also  attended by the member Pensioners Associations and senior officers of  the important Ministries/Departments of Government of India.

                A  delegation of Indian Revenue Service/IRS (Income Tax) officers of 2008  batch called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for  Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public  Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here  today. The delegation sought Dr Jitendra Singh’s intervention for their  promotion.
In  a memorandum submitted to the Minister, the members of the  delegation claimed that, as per the existing IRS Recruitment Rules 2015,  the only method of recruitment to the JAG (Junior Administrative Grade)  level posts in IRS (Income Tax) is by promotion. The 2008 batch  officers were placed in STS (Senior Time-Scale) on 1st January 2013,  whereby they would be completing 5 years of regular service on 1st  January 2018. The memorandum sought relaxation for promotion so that  they could achieve the higher grade w.e.f. 1st April 2017.
In  this regard, the memorandum sought to bring to the notice that the  Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) has been granting  relaxation to eligible service officers of IRS in STS scale from 2002 to  2007 batches for promotion to higher JAG level. Therefore, the same  precedence can be followed in their case also.
The  members of the delegation conveyed to the Minister that initially, a  proposal for them was sent by the Department of Revenue to DoPT, but it  was returned with certain queries. However, now, when the proposal has  been re-submitted after addressing the queries, they requested the DoPT  to take a kind view and agree to the proposal.

Following Hon’ble Members participated in the  meeting -Shri Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma, Shri Chandrakant Bhaurao Khaire,  Shri Narasimham Thota, Shri Ninong Ering, Shri Pansunoori Dayakar, Col.

Chairing the meeting, Minister of State (Independent  Charge) for M/o Petroleum & Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan  welcomed all Members of the Consultative Committee to the first such  meeting of 2017. Shri Pradhan emphasized that India is a fast growing  economy and macro-economic drivers indicate significant upside in  consumption of petroleum products. He said that the Government have been  giving high priority to conservation and efficiency measures in order  to reduce the increasing gap between demand and indigenous supply of  crude oil. He said fuel conservation has two pronged benefits in the  Indian context ie it is necessary for energy security and also for its  importance in health and environment protection. The Ministry has taken  up a goal of reducing import of petroleum products by 10 % by the year  2022. Development of Fuel Economy Norms for heavy duty vehicles,  leapfrogging from BS IV to VI fuel norms, positioning of cleaner fuels  like PNG and CNG, ethanol blending of Petrol etc are some of the  decisions of Government in the direction of petroleum efficiency and  conservation. Shri Pradhan highlighted significant steps taken by PCRA  on conservation activities being undertaken by them like training  programmes for drivers of various STUs, heavy commercial vehicles,  Energy Efficiency Studies  of small, medium and large industries ,  awareness programmes for promoting conservation of LPG and PNG for  housewives and cooks amongst others. PCRA is conducting month long mass  awareness programmes across the country on fuel conservation called  Saksham - 2017.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production
 
 
Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:
 
 
 
1.1        Crude oil production by ONGC during December, 2016 was 1904.60 TMT which is 1.37% lower than the monthly target but 0.47% higher when compared with December 2015. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-December, 2016 was 16629.09 TMT which is 1.44% lower than target for the period and 1.48% lower than production during corresponding period of last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to less than planned production from marginal fields of Mumbai High and natural decline in matured fields of western offshore.
 
1.2        Crude oil production by OIL during December, 2016 was 280.59 TMT which is 10.18% lower than monthly target but 3.87% higher than production in December 2015. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-December, 2016 was 2430.46 TMT which is 3.29% lower than target for the period and 0.82% lower than production during corresponding period of last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to less than planned contribution from high producing areas like Greater Hapjan, Greater Chandmari fields & Naharkatiya fields on account of rise in water cut and less than envisaged contribution from newly drilled wells.
 
1.3        Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during December 2016 was 869.89 TMT which is 4.52% lower than the monthly target and 4.81% lower than December, 2015. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-December, 2016 was 7985.79 TMT which is 2.49% lower than target for the period and 7.34% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
 
Ø  RJ-ON-90/1: Plant tripped on 16.12.16, stopping production from Mangala & Aishwarya. Increase in water cut in Mangala wells, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam
Ø  Natural Decline in Ravva & CB-OS/2
Ø  Closure of 1 well in MA field in KG-DWN-98/3
 
Natural Gas
2              Natural gas production during December 2016 was 2736.80 MMSCM which is 9.68% lower than the target for the month and 0.01% lower than the production in December 2015. Cumulative natural gas production during April-December, 2016 was 23885.34 MMSCM which is 5.04% lower than target for the period and 3.29% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of December, 2016 and cumulatively for the period April-December, 2016 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production

 
 
2.1        Natural gas production by ONGC during December, 2016 was 1926.75 MMSCM which is 5.58% lower than the monthly target but 5.92% higher when compared with December 2015. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-December, 2016 was 16420.24 MMSCM which is 1.82% lower than the cumulative target but 0.91% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to decline in reservoir pressure in Bassein field and less production from Daman & C-26 Cluster due to evacuation constraint as export lines to TCPP platform is not yet completed.
 
2.2        Natural gas production by OIL during December, 2016 was 246.50 MMSCM which is 0.14% lower than the monthly target and 7.37% lower than December 2015. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-December, 2016 was 2211.56 MMSCM which is 2.17% lower than the cumulative target but 4.32% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to decline production potential in a few high producing gas wells due to unexpected subsurface problems like water and sand ingress.
2.3    Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during December 2016 was 563.56 MMSCM which is 24.14% lower than the monthly target and 13.55% less when compared with December, 2015. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-December, 2016 was 5253.54 MMSCM which is 14.82% lower than the cumulative target and 16.68% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
Ø  Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3.
Ø  Underperformance of Sohagpur West CBM block extended dewatering hampering production in Raniganj East CBM block.
Ø  Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field in KG-DWN-98/3.
Ø  RJ-ON-90/1: Plant tripped on 16.12.16, stopping production from Mangala & Aishwarya. Increase in water cut in Mangala wells, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam.
Ø  RJ-ON/6: Increase in Water cut in few wells.
 
 
Refinery Production (in terms of Crude oil processed)
 
3        Refinery production during December, 2016 was 21441.47 TMT which is 3.21% higher than the target for the month and 6.43% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Cumulative production during April-December, 2016 was 183886.03 TMT which is 2.16% higher than the target for the period and 7.82% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III. Company-wise production for the month of December, 2016 and cumulatively for the period April-December, 2016 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production
 
 
3.1    PSU Refineries’ production during December, 2016 was 12098.44 TMT which is 3.74% higher than the target for the month and 11.53% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by PSU refineries during April-December, 2016 was 102756.76 TMT which is 1.29% higher than the target for the period and 11.74% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some PSU refineries are as under:
v  IOCL, Paradip:  Throughput lower due to coke upliftment issue.
v  IOCL, Haldia:  Throughput is lower due to VGO stock build-up
v  IOCL, Guwahati/Digboi: Lower availability of Assam crude.
v  CPCL, Manali: Throughput of Manali Refinery lower than target due to 'Vardha' cyclone which hit the refinery on 12th Dec'16 and lead to water crises as all water sources were temporally shutdown.
v  CPCL, CBR: Lower throughput in CBR due to product evacuation constraints.
v  NRL, Numaligarh: Unplanned shutdown of DCU.
 
3.2    Production in JV refineries during December, 2016 was 1570.99 TMT which is 18.92% higher than the target for the month and 9.36% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-December, 2016 was 12696.91 TMT which is 10.54% higher than the target for the period but 1.72% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.
3.3    Production in private refineries during December, 2016 was 7772.04 TMT which is 0.24% lower than the target for the month and 1.13% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-December, 2016 was 68432.36 TMT which is 2.04% higher than the target for the period and 4.21% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.
3.4    Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of December, 2016 and cumulatively for the period April-December, 2016 vis-à-vis April-December, 2015 are given at Annexures-IV and V respectively.

Over 1.60 Cr BPL households have been given LPG connections under PMUY
 
Petroleum Minister inaugurates the month long awareness drive on fuel conservation Saksham 2017 today in New Delhi
 
The Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Petroleum & Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said that the draft norms on fuel efficiency for heavy duty vehicles will be released on 1st April, 2017. The Minister made the announcement during his address at the Saksham 2017, month long awareness drive on fuel conservation, at Siri Fort Auditorium, New Delhi today. He said that the BS IV fuel will be available across the country from April, 2017 and that the Ministry is already planning and working on bringing in BS VI fuel by 2020.
 
Speaking at the event, Shri Pradhan urged everyone to follow fuel conservation steps and contribute to saving of energy and fuel wherever they can. He added there are more than 15 Cr two wheelers and more than 3 Cr three wheelers currently on roads in India. By turning off vehicle engine at red light stops of traffic signal, about 2 % of fuel can be saved which translates to Rs 14000 Cr of saving for the country. Drawing a parallel to the PMUY which has an allocation of Rs 8000 Cr to distribute LPG cylinders to 5 Cr BPL families across the country, Shri Pradhan highlighted the importance of energy/fuel conservation for saving costs that could be used for other developmental projects. He informed that over 1.60 Cr LPG connections have been given under PMUY since its launch in May 2016.
 
Shri Pradhan inaugurated the month long awareness drive on fuel conservation called Saksham 2017 (Sanrakshan Kshamta Mahotsav), organized by PCRA and other Oil and Gas PSUs.  Saksham 2017 is aimed to create awareness amongst masses towards judicious utilization and conservation of petroleum products along with use of energy efficient appliances and switching to cleaner fuels. 
 
The Minister released the Saksham - logo at the event. He also administered the oath of conservation to all the participants including school children who were present at the event. Digital certificates for showing commitment to fuel conservation were also launched by the Minister. Minister also awarded the National school winners of essay and painting competitions which included study tour for children to Japan, laptops & cash prizes. The awards are to encourage children for continuing their efforts and enhancing their knowledge on energy conservation. Shri Pradhan also flagged off publicity vans to spread conservation awareness.
 
Shri Pradhan underlined the need for energy security and conservation for future generation and for providing clean fuel for poor households. He appealed to all citizens to participate in this festival and adopt practices/behavioural changes leading to fuel saving such as LPG, PNG, CNG. He said that the children are our present and also the future and we should educate them to conserve energy and fuel. He encouraged the children to take up fuel conservation in their families, just as they have taken up on Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan. 
 
Calling for efforts on public participation and partnership on energy/fuel conservation, Shri Pradhan dedicated Saksham 2017 to the country.
 
During this month long drive, thousands of workshops will be held for drivers of commercial vehicles and housewives, cooks on adopting simple fuel saving measures. Saksham is aimed to show path of fuel conservation through activities like Quiz Show, Saksham Asian Cycling Championship, Walkathons & concerts across the country.

MoS (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said neither the customers nor petrol pump dealers will bear additional charges on digital transactions at petrol stations. He said that the Government had issued guidelines in February 2016 stating that the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) charge will not be passed on to the consumers and that the stakeholders will take appropriate steps to absorb the MDR charges. 
The Government has stepped in after the issue on levy on digital transaction at petrol stations was raised by association of petrol pump dealers. Shri Pradhan said that there will be no additional levy on digital transaction at petrol stations even after 13 January, 2017. He also said that the Petrol pump transaction fee is a business model between the banks & oil marketing companies which they will resolve.

                Oil Marketing Companies, viz  IndianOil, BPCL & HPCL are now offering an upfront discount of Rs  5/- on every LPG refill to all LPG customers who will book and pay for  their LPG cylinders online. Customers can make payment through existing  online modes i.e net banking, credit & debit cards at the time of  web-booking their refills. 
Customers will get the discounted amount displayed  on their screens – i.e. net amount i.e refill RSP minus (-) incentive  amount of Rs.5/- which they need to pay for their refill transactions.  The net discounted amount will also be shown on the cash memo  accompanying the home-delivery of the LPG cylinder.
Under the aegis of Ministry of Petroleum &  Natural Gas, it the endeavour of all Oil Marketing Companies aim to  encourage consumers to increasingly shift to such payment modes through  digital platforms to achieve the objective of no-cash or less-cash based  transactions. The incentive will encourage more and more LPG consumers  to go for cashless mode transactions.

                The Ministry of Power, Government of India signed the MoU for Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) with Tamil Nadu in New Delhi, on 9th January, 2017. Also, with the signing of the ‘24x7 Power For All (PFA)’ roadmap document with the State, the roadmap for all the 28 States, except one, and all the 7 Union Territories in the country have now been finalized and is under implementation. It is the most significant milestone in this initiative founded on the principles of cooperative federalism. 
 
Providing access to reliable and quality power supply to all citizens/ establishments by 2019 is at the core of the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision for the nation and the Ministry of Power’s 24x7 PFA program is aimed at delivering on it.
The Program has been instrumental in mainstreaming the Ministry’s  focus on energy efficiency and Demand Side Management interventions and  has resulted in increased participation with speedy rollout of the  UJALA/ DELP and other EESL led schemes. It is important to note that UJALA has emerged as the world’s largest and most successful LED bulbs program.
Increased role of central sector agencies, such as NTPC, in addressing sectors’ operational viability in the case of proposed acquisition of state owned generation assets in Rajasthan and in fast-tracking  capacity addition in the case of Patratu project in Jharkhand are  outcomes of the comprehensive approach adopted under 24x7 PFA Program to  resolve state specific problems.
Besides  development of segment wise coordinated physical rollout plans and  rigorous analysis on financial viability of state utilities under the  24x7 PFA program in two States of Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, the  plans for which were made in first 100 days of coming of this  Government, led to the formulation of the UDAY. Looking at the balance sheets of these states, it was found that unless the states are taken out of the debt trap in which they were in and made financially sustainable, all plans of 24x7 would remain unfulfilled. 
The  PFA Program has also benefited several states in addressing funding gap  for the investments required to ensure 24x7 power access to all. The  funding gap analysis conducted as part of the exercise enabled the  Ministry to assist states through innovative means of financing  including mechanisms such as additional funding under ongoing programs (like DDUGJY, IPDS), multilateral funding, additional support from FIs and PPPs etc.
Electricity  being a concurrent subject and given the focus of the Government on  pursuing cooperative federalism, the first task was to develop and agree  on detailed roadmaps for each state. State specific roadmaps were prepared under the guidance of the Ministry of Power and Central Electricity Authority (CEA). 24x7 PFA initiative has provided the much needed platform for all-encompassing integrated planning. In  addition to integrated planning at the level of vertically unbundled  utilities and other state level agencies, the exercise also provided an  opportunity for mainstreaming the efforts of all central level  ministries and agencies, such as Ministry of Coal, MNRE, PGCIL, NTPC,  BEE, EESL, REC, PFC etc., to ensure access to reliable and quality power to all households/ establishments in each and every state by 2019.
To  further augment the effort of the states under the 24x7 PFA initiative,  the Ministry is now formulating a scheme for funding of the investments  required to ensure last mile connectivity to all households which are  not already covered under DDUGJY and state schemes.

                Union Minister of Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and  Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal dedicated the LED based Street Lighting  National Programme (SLNP), currently running in the South Delhi  Municipal Corporation (SDMC) area, to the Nation here today. It is the  World’sLargestStreet Light Replacement Programme, which is being  implemented by the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint  venture under the Ministry of Power, Government of India. 
 
The SLNP programme is presently running in Punjab, Himachal  Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Tripura, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh,  Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat and  Rajasthan. A total of 15.59 lakh street lights have already been replaced in the country with LED bulbs,  which is resulting in energy savings of 20.66 crore kWh, avoiding  capacity of 51.47 MW and reducing 1.71 lakh tonnes of greenhouse gas  emissions per annum. The energy efficiency market in India is estimated  at US$ 12 billion that can potentially result in energy savings of up to  20 per cent of current consumption, by way of innovative business and  implementation models.
 
While addressing the gathering, Shri Goyal said that this  Government does not believe in taking money from the people, on one  hand, and subsidizing their electricity bills, on the other. Rather, the  Government believes in empowering the people and the power  infrastructure in the country so as to make available 24x7 Affordable,  Quality Power to all Citizens of the country. The Minister added that  the residents of SDMC area would benefit from the LED Street Lighting  Programme as it would lead to a reduction in dark spots and increased  security. Further, he added that the cumulative savings of Rs. 135 crores in next 7 years and Rs. 50 crores per annum beyond that, through  this programme, would help in investment in social development  initiatives and that too without the people needing to spend any extra  money.
 
Under the SLNP, SDMC area alone accounts for over 2 lakh street  light replacements. The cumulative annual energy savings in SDMC through  this programme is 2.65 crore kWh which has helped to avoid capacity  addition of 6.6 MW, resulting in a daily reduction of 22,000 tonnes of  greenhouse gases. The Minister inaugurated the Phase II of the street lighting programme,  under which EESL has signed a tripartite agreement with BSES and SDMC  to install 75,000 more street lights with more focus on installation in  parks.  
 
In the SDMC Project, EESL is addressing complaints from various  sources viz., registered from BSES helpline, night patrolling team by  EESL, mobile vans, e-mails, social media and other sources including  Ward Councilors. Additionally, EESL is putting stringent complaint  redressal mechanism and Centralized Control and Monitoring System (CCMS)  to enable remote operation and monitoring of the street lights. CCMS  provides real time information on energy consumption and remote  monitoring of the street lights.  
 
On the occasion, Shri Goyal launched the mobile app called EESL SL Complaint App  for SDMC, wherein users can now lodge complaints about faulty street  lights. These complaints will be addressed to within a period of 48  hours. Consumers can also WhatsApp on the helpline numbers 7827999111/  7827999222 or they can send their complaints to sdmc@eesl.co.in.
Other dignitaries present on the occasion included Members of  Parliament Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi and Shri Manoj Tiwari, Shri Saurabh  Kumar, MD, EESL, Shri Ashwini Kumar, MD, Solar Energy Corporation of  India Ltd. (SECI) along with other officers of EESL, SDMC and members of  the Resident Welfare Associations  under SDMC area.

Union Minister of State (IC) for  Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal  presided over the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) Scheme with the Government of Tamil Nadu and its Discom TANGEDCO, for operational and financial turnaround of the DISCOM, in New Delhi today. The signing ceremony was held in the august presence of the Shri P. Thangamani, Minister for Electricity, Prohibition & Excise, Government of Tamil Nadu. 
Tamil Nadu would derive an overall net benefit of approximately Rs. 11,000 crores through  UDAY, by way of savings in interest cost, reduction in AT&C and  transmission losses, interventions in energy efficiency, coal reforms  etc. The state also signed 24X7  Power For All document on the occasion. With Tamil Nadu joining the  cause, 92% of country’s Discom debt has been covered under UDAY
By signing the MOU under UDAY, the State Government is taking over 75% of debt of Rs. 30,420 crores of TANGEDCO. The scheme also provides for the balance debt to be re-priced or issued as State guaranteed Discom bonds, at coupon rates around 3-4% less than the average existing interest rate. The State would have savings of about Rs.950 cr. in annual interest cost through reduction of debt and through reduced interest rates on the balance debt. 
UDAY lays stress on improving operational efficiencies of the DISCOMs. Tamil  Nadu and TANGEDCO have committed to bring about operational efficiency  through compulsory feeder and distribution transformer metering, consumer indexing & GIS mapping of losses, upgrade/change transformers, meters etc., smart metering of high-end consumers, reduction in transmission losses and increased power supplies in areas with reduced AT&C losses. The reduction in AT&C losses and transmission losses to 13.5% and 3.7% respectively is likely to bring additional revenue of around Rs. 1,601 crores to TANGEDCO. 
Demand Side interventions in UDAY such as usage of energy-efficient LED bulbs, agricultural pumps, fans & air-conditioners and efficient industrial equipment through PAT (Perform, Achieve and Trade) would help in reducing peak load, flatten load curve and thus help in reducing energy consumption in Tamil Nadu. The gain is expected to be around Rs. 2,304 crores. 
The Central government would also provide incentives to the State Government and the Discom for improving the power infrastructure in the State and for lowering the cost of power. The State would get additional/priority funding through the Central schemes such as Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Power Sector Development Fund (PSDF)  or such other schemes of the Ministries of Power and New &  Renewable Energy, if they meet the operational milestones outlined in  the scheme. 
The  State shall also be supported through additional coal at notified  prices and in case of availability through higher capacity utilization,  low cost power from NTPC and other CPSUs. Other benefits such as coal swapping, coal rationalization, correction in coal grade slippage, availability of 100% washed coal would help the state to further reduce the cost of power. 
The State would gain around Rs. 4,320 crores due to these coal reforms. With the financial turnaround through financial and operational efficiencies, TANGEDCO’s rating would improve, which would help in raising cheaper funds for its future capital investment requirement. This is expected to provide interest cost saving of around Rs. 60 crores for TANGEDCO in 3 years.
The ultimate benefit of signing the MOU would go to the people of Tamil Nadu. Higher demand for power from DISCOMs would mean higher Plant Load Factor (PLF) of generating units and therefore, lesser cost per unit of electricity thereby benefitting consumers. Availability of 24x7 power for all would increase the economic activity and improve employment opportunities in the State. 
UDAY was launched by the Government of India on 20th November, 2015 to ensure a permanent and sustainable solution to the debt-ridden  Distribution utilities to achieve financial stability and growth, now  has 21 States in the Club after Tamil Nadu coming on board. 
Shri  PK. Pujari, Secretary, Power Ministry, Rajeev Ranjan, ACS(Energy),  Government of Tamil Nadu, Dr. PV Ramesh, CMD, Rural Electrification  Corporation Limited, Dr. M. Sai Kumar, CMD, Tangedco and other senior  officials of Power Ministry and Tamil Nadu government were present at  the occasion.

Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New  & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal presided over a  bilateral meeting with the Japanese delegation led by H.E. Mr. Hiroshige  Seko, Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry, Government of Japan.  The meeting took place on the side-lines of the 7th India-Japan Energy Forum, 2017 being held in New Delhi today.
During the day long sessions in the Energy Forum,  there would be technical discussion sessions on critical subjects of  mutual cooperation in the energy sector, which include Enhancing  Renewable Energy and Grid Stability, Promoting Technological Cooperation  in Energy Efficiency in Industrial and Commercial Sectors and  Technological Options and Energy Efficiency Improvement in Transport  Sector.
Speaking on the scope of India-Japan cooperation,  Shri Goyal said that this forum is a platform to engage with Japan for  mutual benefit in the energy sector by working towards bringing Japanese  strengths in cutting edge engineering and technology to India. This  would help India in enhancing Grid stability, bringing Electric Mobility  at affordable prices to the country etc., which the Government is  vigorously pursuing, he added. 
The Minister also informed that during the bilateral  meet with his Japanese counterpart, it was put across that India’s  power demand is going to expand four fold in the next 15 years to become  one of the largest energy markets globally and it would open immense  business opportunities for Japan in the sector in India, hence making  this bilateral engagement mutually beneficial for both countries. 
Shri Goyal also said that India and Japan should  cooperate on long term contracts for LNG with a defined cost of energy  which would provide a stabilizing factor for the Renewable Energy thrust  that India is currently giving. India being a price sensitive market  cannot afford costly power and hence needs Japanese cooperation in  maintaining a balance between renewable energy and conventional coal  based power.
Further, Shri Goyal said that since large number of  items in the Renewable energy sector come from abroad, we are working to  create a sustainable framework for encouraging the manufacturing of  solar equipments in India at less costs so as to make 24x7 Affordable  and Quality power available to each citizen in India. This will also  give a fillip to the Make in India mission by scaling up manufacturing  sector in India with the help of cutting edge Japanese technologies in  the power sector. India should leap frog the learning curve with the  help of contemporary next generation technologies and should not miss  out on the opportunities to provide sustainable energy future to every  citizen, based on their needs, he added.

SLNP App to be Launched to address Grievances Regarding Faulty Street Lights
 
 Union  Minister of Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri  Piyush Goyal will dedicate the Street Lighting National Programme  (SLNP), currently running in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation  (SDMC) area, to the Nation in New Delhi on 9th January, 2017. It is the World’s Largest Street  Light Replacement Programme, which is being implemented by the Energy  Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture under the Ministry  of Power, Government of India.
 
The SLNP  programme is presently running in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar  Pradesh, Assam, Tripura, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra  Pradesh, Kerala, Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. A total of  15.36 lakh street lights have already been replaced in the country with  LED bulbs, which is resulting in energy savings of 20.35 crore kWh,  avoiding capacity of 50.71 MW and reducing 1.68 lakh tonnes of  greenhouse gas emissions per annum. The energy efficiency market in  India is estimated at US$ 12 billion that can potentially result in  energy savings of up to 20 per cent of current consumption, by way of  innovative business and implementation models.
 
Under the  SLNP, SDMC area alone accounts for over 2 lakh street light  replacements. The cumulative annual energy savings in SDMC through this  programme is 2.65 crore kWh which has helped to avoid capacity addition  of 6.6 MW, resulting in a daily reduction of 22,000 tonnes of greenhouse  gases. Additionally in Delhi, under Phase II of  the street lighting programme, EESL has signed a tripartite agreement  with BSES and SDMC to install 75,000 more street lights with more focus  on installation in parks. 
 
In the SDMC  Project, EESL is addressing complaints from various sources viz.,  registered from BSES helpline, night patrolling team by EESL, mobile  vans, e-mails, social media and other sources including Ward Councilors.  Additionally, EESL is putting stringent complaint redressal mechanism  and Centralized Control and Monitoring System (CCMS) to enable remote  operation and monitoring of the street lights. CCMS provides real time  information on energy consumption and remote monitoring of the street  lights. 
 
On the occasion, Shri Goyal will also launch the mobile app called EESL SL Complaint App  for SDMC, wherein users can now lodge complaints about faulty street  lights. These complaints will be addressed to within a period of 48  hours. Consumers can also WhatsApp on the helpline numbers 7827999111/  7827999222 or they can send their complaints to sdmc@eesl.co.in.

Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal launched the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) Web Portal & Mobile App, here today. It would track and monitor the progress of DISCOMs on operational and financial parameters under the UDAY scheme. An important part of the ‘Digital India Initiative’, the portal/app will ensure transparency, enhance accountability of various stakeholders and facilitate view of near real time progress, enabling consumers to demand better services for themselves.
 
Giving details of the UDAY portal/app, Shri Goyal informed that it would provide details of latest progress made by various DISCOMs, as recent as last month/quarter. The DISCOM-level data will be integrated into State level and National level, which will be processed and used for advanced performance analysis. The National, State and DISCOM level dashboards will thus provide a snapshot of latest financial and operational performance at various levels in public domain. 
 
The Minister said that the portal/app is a logical follow-up to the MoUs signed by the States under UDAY, not only to enable monitoring of the progress made by the DISCOMs at Central Ministry level, but also for making future schemes/plans for improving DISCOMs performance. This will be the first time when the performance metrics of various DISCOMs will be available in a single platform, which shall promote healthy competition amongst the DISCOMs/States. This will bring about an ethos of ‘Competitive Federalism’ among different States to achieve best progress in public schemes, especially in the power sector, Shri Goyal added.
 
Praising the advent of transparency and accountability with the launch of web portals and mobile apps, Shri Goyal said that the implementation of public programmes and schemes has become a ‘Citizen Process’, as these portals and apps have placed all the information in public domain for scrutiny. Suppliers can also develop their capabilities by understanding the focus area of the Utilities, resulting in improved performance by them, he added.
 
Giving examples of achievements in UDAY among States, the minister quoted the Rajasthan Discom where, in less than two years, annual losses of around Rs. 15000 crores will soon be converted into profits. He also talked about Haryana’s progress, where as an example, all 173 villages in Panchkula have received 24x7 Power Supply. Shri Goyal encouraged officials of the Ministry to think innovatively and come out with performance based rewards for best performing States under UDAY. He also talked about starting a ‘Citizen Poll’ to receive feedback on the ground level achievements of different schemes, which would help recalibrating their implementation process.
 
During the event, the States of Telangana and Assam joined UDAY by signing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with the Ministry of Power for operational and financial turnaround of their respective DISCOMs, making the tally in the UDAY Club to 20. States with over 90% of total DISCOM debts to be covered under UDAY after Tamil Nadu comes on board, Shri Goyal added.
 
While the Government of Telangana would take over Rs.8923 crores of the total Rs.11897 crores of DISCOM debt, the Government of Assam would take over Rs.928 crores out of total Rs.1510 crores DISCOM Debt (being 75% of their respective DISCOM debt outstanding as on 30.09.2015, as envisaged in the scheme) and the balance debt would be re-priced or issued as State guaranteed DISCOM bonds. This would amount to annual saving in the interest cost of Rs. 387 crores to Telangana and Rs. 37 crores to Assam respectively. The interest cost on future borrowings is also expected to reduce, providing a saving of around Rs.30-40 crores to these States. 
 
In case of Telangana, the reduction in AT&C losses and transmission losses to 9.95% and 3% respectively is likely to bring additional revenue of around Rs.1476 crores, during the period of turnaround, whereas additional revenue of Rs. 699 crores would accrue to Assam on reduction of AT&C losses and transmission losses to 15% and 3.4% respectively. 
 
The gains to these states through Demand Side interventions in UDAY such as usage of energy-efficient domestic as well as industrial/commercial equipment is expected to be around Rs. 1200 crores & Rs. 260 crores respectively. The States of Telangana and Assam are also expected to benefit around Rs. 2250 crores and Rs. 520 crores respectively on account of the support being extended by the Centre through various coal reform measures. 
 
An overall net benefit of approximately Rs. 6116 crores and Rs. 1663 crores would accrue to these States viz. Telangana and Assam respectively, under UDAY, by way of savings in interest cost, reduction in AT&C and transmission losses, interventions in energy efficiency, coal reforms etc. during the period of turnaround.
 
Other dignitaries present during the event were Shri P.K. Pujari, Secretary, Power, Shri Rajeev Kapoor, Secretary, MNRE, Shri B.P. Pandey, Special Secretary, Power and CMD, REC Ltd, Shri Ajay Mishra, Special Chief Secretary, Energy, Government of Telangana, Zareen Rahman Ahmed, Secretary, Power, Government of Assam and other senior officials of the Ministry of Power and the PSUs under the Ministry. State Power Secretaries from UDAY States were also connected through video conferencing.

With a view to facilitate convenient booking of reserved and unreserved tickets by passengers through cashless modes of payment viz. Credit/Debit cards even at the ticket booking counters, it has been decided to install 10,000 POS (Point of Sale) (Swpie) machines at the PRS (Passenger Reservation System) and UTS counters (including Suburban stations). Following procedure is proposed with regard to cancellation of the tickets booked through POS machines.
1.	Cancellation cum refund procedure for UTS/PRS tickets booked using SBI POS for payment:
Refund of PRS/UTS tickets shall be done using the offline process as detailed below:
i)	The offline process of refund shall be followed in case of tickets booked using SBI POS for payment which means that the refund amount shall be credited to the account of card holder without any need to swipe his card at the time of cancellation at the counter.
ii)	The customer can approach to any counter anywhere for cancellation of ticket booked from SBI POS. Needless to mention that PRS ticket can be cancelled only at any PRS/PRS cum UTS counter and UTS ticket shall be cancelled only at any UTS/PRS cum UTS counter.
iii)	The print of cancelled PRS ticket would have a message indicating that “Electronic Refund” for the information of the customer. The customer may also be informed verbally or through information board that the refund shall be credited to the account of card holder within 7 days.
 
2.	IRCTC customer care dealing with the refund issues of e-tickets is entrusted with the responsibility to address refund related complaints of tickets issued using POS. IRCTC shall coordinate with SBI, CRIS and concerned Zonal Railways to monitor the processing of refunds on daily basis and to resolve the issues/complaints in expeditious manner.
 
3.	Cancellation cum refund procedure for PRS tickets issued from POS of other banks.
There are around 75 POS machines which were operational at different locations of Indian Railways prior to awarding contract for  installing 10,000 POS machines to SBI. The refund is processed through online method in this POS machines, wherein, the customer needs to swipe his credit/debit card at the POS machine at the time of cancellation of the ticket and the due refund amount as fed by the booking/reservation clerk is credited to the account of the card holder. However, this process of refund is possible only at locations having POS machines. At non POS locations, the Ticket Deposit Receipt (TDR) is issued to affect the refund. This procedure shall continue till further advice. However, the refund of the ticket issued using SBI POS shall not be processed by swiping the card on non SBI POS. While cancelling the ticket, the system shall prompt the booking clerk about the POS (SBI or other bank) which was used at the time of booking and advise the booking clerk not to swipe the card.

A  Joint Venture Agreement was signed today i.e. 20th January, 2017  between Ministry of Railways and Government of Jharkhand for developing  railway infrastructure in the State. 
 
 ●       This Joint Venture agreement for development of Railway Infrastructure will
○       Provide active representation to States in the Planning and Implementation of Railway Infrastructure Projects
○    Speed up the Development of Railway Projects on state’s priority
○    Generate more financial resources through participation of State & other stakeholders in the project specific subsidiaries
●       Government of Jharkhand has  initially identified 3 projects viz., Namkum - Kandra, Giridih -  Parasnath-Madhuban, Tori - Chatra Rail Line covering a length of 222 km  at a cost of Rs. 2150 Crore for taking up through the proposed JV  Company after establishing their viability, bankability and financial  closure.
●       Governments of Kerala, Andhra  Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Haryana, Chhattisgarh and  Gujarat have already signed JV agreement with Ministry of Railways.
●       Government of Jharkhand with 51%  equity is the 9th State which had agreed to form a Joint Venture Company  with the Ministry of Railways.
●       The present railway network  density in Jharkhand is 17.64 Km per 100 square Km which is the best in  India and way above the national average of 2.01 Km per 100 square Km. 
●       Signing of these JVs will go a long way in developing infrastructure in the State of Jharkhand.
●       The average outlay to Jharkhand in  Railway Budget was Rs.1544.3 crore during 2014-15 to 2016-17 which is  an increase of 238% over the average outlay of 457.2 crore during  2009-10 to 2013-14. 
 
BACKGROUND:
●       Indian Railways has been playing a  major role in national integration by connecting the remotest places  and bringing people closer to each other. Railways receive a large  number of demands for network expansion as a Railway line acts as an  engine of growth for the area it serves. 
●       Railways have a large shelf of  ongoing New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects needing about  Rs 3.86 lakh crores to complete. We have been trying to meet the  aspirations of public within limited availability of funds. 
●       To expedite the projects, Railways  have been trying to mobilize resources through other than Gross  Budgetary Support. Towards this mission, 10 State Governments have till  now agreed to share the cost of 41 ongoing projects ranging from 25% to  67% of the project cost. Some States are providing land free of cost in  addition to sharing of construction cost. 
●       In view of the growing demands for  Railway Lines in various States and huge requirement of funds to  execute them, Hon’ble Minister for Railways has taken an initiative for  setting up of Joint Ventures with States for focused project  development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project  implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects.

Roundtable Discussion with External Stakeholders on Energy Initiatives of Indian Railways 
 
Minister  of Railways Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu unveiled Mission 41k during  the Roundtable Discussion with External Stakeholders on Energy  Initiatives of Indian Railways. Shri Suresh Prabhu said that Ministry of  Railways has come up with Mission 41k to save Rs. 41000 crore in the  next decade in Railways’ energy costs. To implement this comprehensive  strategy with the participation of various stakeholders, we shall take  advantage of regulatory frameworks, look at new technologies. He said  that this is an opportunity to relook at everything and determine an  ideal baseline. All electrification works done in the last decade would  be doubled and this would change the energy mix of Indian Railways.  Indian Railways has set a target of 1000 MW of solar power and 200 MW of  wind energy. 
Shri  Prabhu also informed that around 15 – 16 Roundtable Conferences with  Stakeholders are in the pipeline on various initiatives of Indian  Railways. He said that a Round Table discussion is planned on Data  Analytics. Indian Railways generates massive amounts of data and has a  huge captive audience. Ability to optimally utilise these will generate  additional revenue for the Indian Railways. 
Chairman  Railway Board, Shri AK Mital said that a target of moving 45% of the  freight traffic can be achieved only when it can move freight in a cost  efficient manner. This has led to Railways competing with road sector.  At present 70% traffic runs on electric traction. In next 6 -7 years  target has been set to run 90% of the traffic on electric traction. By  procuring electricity through open access, the cost of electricity  procurement comes down drastically which contributes 25% of the working  expenses. He also said that Ministry of Railways has launched Mission  Raftaar to increase the average speed of movement by 5 kmph every year.  Another important Mission for Indian Railways is the establishment of  High hp Locomotive manufacturing plants at Madhepura and Marhaura.
Member  Traction Shri AK Kapoor said that Railways have about 50 % tracks  electrified as of now which greatly contributes in keeping the energy  bill low & reducing the carbon footprint. Ministry of Railways want  to take electrification to 90% in next few years through our Mission  Electrification with an aim to reduce dependence on imported fuel,  change energy mix, and rationalize the cost of energy for Railways. As  part of this, it has embarked upon electrification of additional 24,000  Rkm, i.e., about 90% of Railway BG routes in next 5 years by taking the  present rate of electrification from 2000 Rkm to 4000 Rkm in next 2  years. To achieve this, Ministry of Railways have planned to incorporate  EPC Mode of Contracts for Railway Electrification Projects, Mechanise  the execution through Self Propelled Wiring Trains etc. This will  increase the mobility, reduce energy bill to improve viability of  Railways and also reduce carbon footprint. Ministry of Railways wish to  develop partnership, improve our delivery of electrification projects by  having suggestions from industry.
The  Roundtable Discussion was attended by members and senior officials from  the Railway Board and representatives from various Government and  Private agencies in the field of  energy, International Experts and Industry Associations.
 
Background:
India’s  economy has seen unprecedented growth during the last decade with  average growth of 7–8% per annum in last few years. With economic  growth, the passenger and freight traffic on the Indian Railways is  expected to grow from 3,635 billion passenger kilometres and 961 billion  tonne kilometres respectively in 2005 to 19,427 billion passenger  kilometres and 6,677 billion tonne kilometres respectively by 2030 i.e.,  an increase of more than 6 folds.
Rail  as a mode of transport needs to enhance its capacity. The saturation of  capacity of the Indian Railways on the Golden Quadrilateral has weighed  heavily on the mind of Indian policymakers while taking the decision to  construct dedicated freight corridors (Dedicated Freight Corridor). The  construction of these Dedicated Freight Corridors would enable the  Indian Railways to meet the growing demand for freight transport and  induce a modal shift of freight traffic from road to rail. Since both  corridors are to have more energy efficient locos powered by electric  traction, the completion of Dedicated Freight Corridor project would  lead to higher operational efficiency, resulting in substantial energy  saving and significant reduction of GHG emissions.  
Energy  is a vital input for production and growth. Considering universal  energy access and energy security as one of the fundamental development  goals for the country, Government of India (GoI) has undertaken a two  pronged approach – energy efficiency and Reduction in cost of energy.  India has a definite plan for progressing more towards use of cleaner  energy and factor in energy efficiency in its usage. Railways are taking  number of steps to reduce energy consumption by using various  energy-efficient technologies.
Although,  rail as a mode of transport has less specific energy consumption than  road for passenger and freight movement, the share of the road sector in  Indian transport has witnessed a steady rise at the cost of the rail  sector.
Speed  of railway traffic has been increasing gradually, however for ensuring  sustained efforts in the direction of substantial increase in the speed  of freight and passenger traffic, and time bound delivery, Ministry of  Railways have launched Mission Raftaar. To achieve the objectives of  higher speed under Mission Raftaar, Ministry of Railways are also  manufacturing energy efficient high horsepower electric locomotives and  Electric Multiple Units at our plants in Madhepura, Kancharapara and  Diesel locomotives factory at Marhaura. These locomotives shall be  manufactured in India under the ‘Make in India’ program of the  government. Looking at the future needs of this fast growing nation, it  has been decided to upgrade speed potential on some routes to 160 kmph.  For this, 2x25 kV Electrification system shall be implemented.
Railway  has plans to change its energy mix and shall be using Green Energy.  Railway is going to install solar and wind plants for using green energy  on its system. To change energy mix towards Green energy in a phased  manner, Ministry of Railways plan to set up 1000 MW solar and about 200  MW wind plants.
Development  of new technologies shall provide opportunities for new innovations by  entrepreneurs and local industries shall support the government’s ‘Stand  up India’ program. This discussion will help the Indian Railways to  explore new energy-efficient technologies and develop a roadmap for  sustainable future growth.
For taking forward these deliberation, this roundtable discussion has been organised  in  the field of Railway Electrification, Energy Management, Fuel  Efficiency and Electric & Diesel Traction. These discussions will  help Indian Railways meet its goal to serve people in a more effective  and efficient manner.

                The  Minister of Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin  Gadkari has said that his Ministry would give a grant of upto Rs 2 lakh  to NGOs to take up road safety activities. Addressing the national meet  of NGOs working on road safety issues in New Delhi today, Shri Gadkari  said   that citizen participation  is most essential for making roads safe. He exhorted NGOs to create  awareness about traffic rules and other road safety issues among the  general public . He also called upon them to help the local MPs in  identifying accident black spots in their constituencies and take steps  to rectify them. 
 
About 170 NGOs from all over the country  met in the capital today to deliberate upon  various  aspects and issues relating to road safety. There was a brief  presentation on the occasion to highlight the rather grim road safety  scenario in the country. There were presentations and discussions on  various engineering solutions to road safety and the initiatives being  taken in this direction, motor vehicle engineering to ensure safety on  roads and also effective trauma care. The role of NGOs in spreading  public awareness about road safety issues and their participation in  other road safety activities was also discussed in detail. The NGOs then  shared their field experiences and suggestions with the forum. 
The meet was part of the ongoing activities to mark the 28th Road Safety Week being observed by the Ministry from 9th to 15th January 2017, with the objective of spreading awareness about the issue.

The  Minister for Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin  Gadkari flagged off a Road Safety Walk from India Gate in New Delhi this  morning. Union Minister for Civil Aviation Shri Ashok Gajpathi Raju and   Minister of State for Home Affair Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir were also present on the occasion. The walk was organized by the Ministry  of  Road Transport and Highways, in association with Delhi Police and  Society for Indian Automobile Manufactures (SIAM) to create awareness  about road safety among the general public and to solicit their active  participation in the road safety movement.  The walk marks the beginning of the Road Safety Week which is being observed from 9th to 15th of January 2017.  Several NGOs and youth organizations also participated in the walk.
Speaking on the occasion Shri Gadkari  reiterated  the commitment of his Ministry to reduce the number of road accidents  and the associated fatalities by 50 in the next few years. He said his  Ministry was working on all the 4 Es of road safety – Engineering,  Enforcement, Education and Emergency Care – to meet this objective. He  informed that the work of rectification of identified accident Black  Spots was on  in full swing. An  amount of Rs 11,000 Crore has been set aside for this purpose. He also  called upon people to report to the Ministry any spot where there were  very frequent road accidents, so that steps could be taken to rectify  the engineering defects. He also informed that flyovers, underpasses,  crash barriers, rumble strips, traffic signages etc were being  put up in an appropriate manner to bring down road accidents. 
Shri  Gadkari also expressed hope that the Motor Vehicles (Amendment ) Bill  which is with the Department- related Parliamentary Standing Committee  on Transport, Tourism and Culture for examination will be passed by  Parliament in its next session.The Bill addresses road safety issues by  providing for stiffer penalties, permitting electronic enforcement,  improving fitness certification and licensing regime, statutory  provisions for protection of good Samaritans and recognition of IT  enabled enforcement systems.   The Bill also paves way for reforms in public transport which in turn will help in improving road safety.  The Bill contains provisions for treatment of accident victims during golden hour which will help in saving precious lives. 
Referring  to the Good Samaritans Guidelines issued by the Ministry, Shri Gadkari  called upon people to come forward to help accident victims so that  prompt intervention and emergency care can save precious lives . He  called upon people to follow traffic rules and show responsibility on  roads. In this regard he called upon the youth of the country to reach  out to people and educate them about road safety issues.
Also  speaking on the occasion Shri A.Gajpathi Raju said that it is not  possible to make Indian roads safe unless people come forward and do  their bit in this regard. Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir also called for  people’s participation to bring down the number of road accidents and  fatalities related to these.

The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways is organizing 28th Road Safety Week from 9th to 15th  January 2017 with the objective of spreading awareness about the issue.  The week will open with a Road Safety Walk from India Gate in the  capital on 9th January. Minister of Road Transport &  Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Health & Family Welfare  Shri J.P.Nadda, Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel,  MoS for Home Affairs Shri Hansraj Ahir and Delhi Transport Minister Shri  Satendra Jain will participate in the walk.
On 10th of January, Shri Gadkari will also attend a conclave  being  organized to involve Indian corporate houses and enlist their support  for the cause of promoting road safety. The National Road Safety Council  will also hold its 17th meeting on 10th. This  will be attended by Transport Ministers, DG Police and Transport  Commissioners/ Secretaries of states . This will be followed by a  meeting of NGOs on 11th January.  NGOs would be called upon to participate in the Ministry’s efforts to create awareness about road safety.
In addition to this, the Ministry will launch two mobile apps – e-Challan and m-Parivahan -  during the week. e-Challan  is a comprehensive digital solution for transport enforcement and  traffic police that is integrated with Vahan and Sarathi applications.  It  will provide a number of user friendly features covering major  functionalities of the traffic enforcement system. It will provide  improved transparency by connecting all stakeholders through a common  system and ensuring data integrity; it will also provide ease of  operations, efficient monitoring through digitization of records that  will enhance the visibility of offenders; and overall better traffic  management. 
The  Ministry will also organize country-wide essay competitions for school  children on the topic of road safety. The entrees can be in Hindi,  English or any language included in the Indian Constitution.  
m-Parivahan  is a citizen centric app that will facilitate access to various  transport related services. The app provides for virtual driving license  and registration certificate through back end connection to Transport  National Register.  If a vehicle  number is entered into the app, it will give full details of the car and  the owner including his DL and RC. This will provide a way to check  genuineness of a vehicle and driver, help in passenger safety when  hiring a driver or when buying a second hand vehicle. However, the user  has to be registered so that his credentials can be established. One of  the ways of doing this would be through an Aadhar based OTP. 
The app will also facilitate good Samaritans through technology. They can report accidents by clicking pictures and reporting  to  traffic authorities in states and to RTOs, with the option of hiding  their identity if they so wish. They can also report traffic violations.  States will be asked to provide linkages to the 108 service for better  response. 
The Ministry also plans to extend the Highway Advisory System (HAS) that it had launched last year as  a pilot project on Delhi-Jaipur highway for 2400 km on 12 national highways covering 13 states viz.  Delhi,  Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra,  Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, West Bengal and Odisha.  HAS is a free-to-air information distribution system that uses radio to  make the travelling experience on National Highways safer, faster and  hassle-free. HAS control centre collects data, processes  and analyzes it , generates alerts and sends it to be broadcast by All India Radio. 
 
In addition to all this the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways is also  organizing workshops in the states with different stakeholders to  sensitize about road safety. So far, workshops have been organized in  Bihar, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Assam, Rajasthan and Puducherry and the  participation has been very encouraging.  Action  Plan on Road Safety, local road safety issues, State Road Safety  Policy, etc are discussed in the meeting. The Ministry will organize the  workshop in each state by March 2017. The Ministry will also run road safety campaigns  through social media such as twitter, face book, etc.

Department of Rural Development was given a target to complete 33 lakh houses in 2016-17.  These included houses that were taken up under the Indira AwaasYojana (IAY) and were incomplete on 1st April 2016. Many of them were incomplete for many years. Of these, 21.57 lakh houses have been completed so far. This is nearly double of what was being completed each year in the 2012-13 to 2014-15 period. The Table below shows the year wise completion –

            21.57 lakhs
            
        
    

 
 Sincere efforts are being made to complete 33 lakh houses in the current financial year, in partnership with States. 
 
In the current financial year, on 20th November, 2016, Hon’ble Prime Minister formally launched Pradhan MantriAwaasYojana (Gramin) - PMAY(G), with an original approval for33 lakhs new PMAY Gramin houses, which has now been increased to 44 lakhs.
 
The targets have been communicated to the States and after following an intensive process of beneficiary selection using SECC ( Socio-Economic Caste Census-2011)  and Gram Sabha, housing design typology finalization, finalization of training programme of rural masons and geo tagging of all currently occupied houses to establish that only poor households have been selected, States have started the registration process for construction and over 14.23 lakh beneficiaries have already been registered so far. 
 16.53 lakh images of current dwellings are uploaded on the AwaasSoftwebsite.  The work on all these houses are expected to be started over the next one month, and completion period for these houses has been brought down to only 12 months with efforts to complete more than 50 per cent of houses in six months.  Most of these 44 lakh houses are expected to be completed before December, 2017. Altogether one crore and 33 lakh houses will be completed in three years from 2016-17 to 2018-19.

Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), a flagship scheme of the Ministry of Rural Development will achieve the annual targeted length of 48,812 kilometers of rural roads by 31st March, 2017, as the construction work picks up from January to May every year. As on 27.01.2017, a total of 32,963kms. has been completed which is 67.53% of the annual target.   This translates to 111 kms. of roads getting constructed every day.  According to the annual target (48,812 kms.), the average per day construction should be 133kms per day.  It is important to realize that September to December are lean months for road construction, whereas the construction picks up from January to May every year.  It is also important to underline that from April to August, 2016 PMGSY had achieved an average per day construction of 139 kms. per day and therefore by 31st March, 2017 it will achieve the annual targeted length of 48,812 kms.  
 
The annual target of habitations in 2016-17 is 15,000 habitations, against which, as on date (27.01.2017) 6,473 habitations have been connected.  PMGSY would also by 31st March, 2017, achieve the habitation target also.
 
Another major achievement has been the focus of using “green” technologies and non-conventional materials (waste plastic, cold mix, geo-textiles, fly ash, copper and iron slag etc.) in construction of PMGSY roads because these are locally available, low cost, non-polluting, labour friendly and fast construction technologies / materials.  In the first 14 years of PMGSY (from 2000 to 2014), only 806.93 kms. of roads were constructed using these technologies / materials.  In the last 2 years (2014-2016), 2,634.02 kms. of PMGSY roads have been constructed using these technologies /materials.  In the present year (2016-17) till date (27.01.2017), 3,000 kms. have been constructed using these technologies / materials. 
 
It is also important to note that the progress achieved so far till 27th January, in 2016-17 is far more than what was achieved in the comparable period, in each one of the last 5 years (i.e. 2011 to 2016).

प्रधानमंत्री श्री नरेन्‍द्र मोदी जी की अध्‍यक्षता में केन्‍द्रीय  मंत्रिमंडल ने देश में ग्रामीण विकास को बढ़ावा देने के लिए आज एक नई योजना  का अनुमोदन कर दिया है। इस योजना के तहत सरकार ब्‍याज सब्सिडी उपलब्‍ध  कराएगी। ब्‍याज सब्सिडी ऐसे प्रत्‍येक ग्रामीण परिवार के लिये उपलब्‍ध  होगी, जो प्रधानमंत्री आवास योजना-ग्रामीण (पीएमएवाई-जी) के दायरे में नहीं  है।
इस योजना के तहत ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों में लोग नये मकान बना सकेंगे या  अपने मौजूदा पक्‍के मकानों का विस्‍तार कर सकेंगे। योजना के अंतर्गत ऋण  लेने वाले लाभार्थियों को दो लाख रूपये तक की ऋण राशि पर ब्‍याज-सब्सिडी दी  जाएगा।
इस योजना से बड़ी संख्‍या में ग्रामीणजनों को लाभ होगा तथा दीर्घकालिक 24 वर्षों के लिए ऋण प्राप्‍त होगा।
राष्‍ट्रीय आवास बैंक इस योजना को कार्यान्वित करेगी। सरकार, राष्‍ट्रीय  आवास बैंक को 3 प्रतिशत ब्‍याज अनुदान का वर्तमान मूल्‍य सीधे प्रदान करेगी  और इसके बदले, यह बैंक ब्‍याज सब्सिडी की राशि प्राथमिक ऋणदाता संस्‍थाओं  (अनुसूचित वाणिज्यिक बैंक, गैर-बैंकिंग वित्‍तीय कंपनियों इत्‍यादि) को  अंतरित करेगी। इसके परिणामस्‍वरूप, लाभा‍र्थी के लिये मासिक किश्‍त कम हो  जाएगी।
योजना के अंतर्गत सरकार वर्तमान व्‍यवस्‍थाओं के माध्‍यम से  लाभार्थियों को तकनीकी   सहायता सहित प्रधानमंत्री आवास योजना-ग्रामीणके  साथ उचित समन्‍वय के आवश्‍यक उपाय भी करेगी। इस नई योजना से ग्रामीण  क्षेत्रों में आवासीय इकाइयों में सुधार के साथ, ग्रामीण आवास क्षेत्रमें  रोजगार सृजन भी होगा।

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has approved a new scheme for promotion of Rural Housing in the country.   The Government would provide interest subsidy under the scheme.  Interest subsidy would be available to every rural household who is not  covered under the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana (Grameen), PMAY(G).
The scheme would enable people in rural areas to construct new  houses or add to their existing pucca houses to improve their dwelling  units.  The beneficiary who takes a loan under the scheme would be  provided interest subsidy for loan amount upto Rs. 2 Lakhs.
National Housing Bank would implement the scheme. The Government  would provide net present value of the interest subsidy of 3 percent to  the National Housing Bank upfront which will, in turn, pass it to the  Primary Lending Institutions (Scheduled Commercial Banks, NBFCs etc.).  As a result the equated monthly installment (EMI) for the beneficiary  would be reduced.
Under the scheme, the Government would also take necessary steps for  proper convergence with PMAY-G including technical support to  beneficiary through existing arrangements. The new scheme is expected to  improve housing stock in the rural areas, as well as create employment  opportunities in rural housing sector.

                               The Government mounted the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) with the purpose of ranking households for receiving benefits under government programmes. The Socio Economic and Caste Census has been concluded. The Ministry of Rural Development has decided to use SECC data for identification of beneficiaries and for generating priority list of beneficiaries under its programmes.

 
            An Expert Group under the Chairmanship of former Finance Secretary Shri Sumit Bose was constituted to study the objective criteria for allocation of resources to States and identification and prioritization of beneficiaries under various programme using Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) data. The other members of the Expert Group are:
 
(a)                Shri Amarjeet Sinha, the then  AS(RD), now SRD                         Member
(b)               Dr. Mahendra Dev, Director, Indira Gandhi Institute of 
Development Research (IGIDR), Mumbai                                      Member
(c)                Dr. Rinku Murgai,  Economist, World Bank                                   Member
(d)               Dr. Himanshu, Associate Professor, JNU, New Delhi                     Member
(e)                Shri Manoranjan Kumar, EA(RD)                                           Member  Secretary
 
The Expert Group during its interim discussion with MoRD had given a road map on selection of beneficiaries as well as criteria for allocation of resources to the states for Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G).
 
  The Expert Group’s interim advice has been accepted by the Ministry and accordingly appropriate guidelines have been issued to make inter –state allocation based on SECC data to cover households under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAG) and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM).
 The Expert Group has concluded that the use of SECC data and its TIN Number would enable the government to improve the efficacy of its interventions and will result in improved outcome. However, the Expert Group has observed that regular updation and verification of SECC data is prerequisite to eliminate the need to mount standalone SECC in the long run, which would put additional burden on public resources. The SECC has the potential to move from being only a census-like socio-economic database to becoming the core of a functioning Social Registry Information System (SRIS). SRIS would result in several advantages in implementation of social sector schemes. It has the potential to streamline programme administration, reduce duplication of benefit and fraud, saving on time and costs for both programme applicants and services providers, monitoring the living standards of beneficiaries over time, better targeting of vulnerable and marginalized sections of the society and enable expansion of the coverage of the programmes. Finally, the use of SECC data would lead to better budgetary planning and allocation of resources for various programmes. 
 

           The Chairman of the Group presented its Report to the Hon’ble Minister (RD) Shri Narendra Singh Tomar this morning. The Minister complemented the Chairman and other Members of the Expert Group for their recommendations and objectivities.

Several  Nobel laureates opined that India has a great potential to be a  scientific power and should invest more in basic & fundamental  researches. The themes of the dialogue were captured by artists as they  were speaking to a huge gathering of scientists, students and general  public as a part of the first Nobel Prize Series being held in Ahmedabad in conjunction with the biennial summit of Vibrant Gujarat. 

The Programme christened as Nobel Dialogue saw active participation of Nine Nobel Laureates including Dr. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Nobel Prize winner in  Chemistry, Dr. Richard Roberts, Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology or  Medicine, Dr. Harold Varmus, Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology or  Medicine, Dr. Randy Schekman, Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology or  Medicine, David Gross, Nobel Prize Laureate in Physics, Dr. Ada Yonath, Nobel Prize Laureate in Chemistry, Dr. Serge Haroche, Nobel Prize Laureate in Physics and Dr.  William E Moerner Nobel Prize Laureate in Chemistry. The dialogue was  held in two sessions:  1. Basic or Applied Research? Fostering an Innovative Environment and  2. Local Research, Global Impact: Addressing Global Challenges.


Interesting discussions ranging from getting rid of  mosquitoes to tackle malaria, research for finding out new vaccines,  genetic modification of food crops and the need for strengthening  education particularly science education were discussed at these two  sessions. The first dialogue was introduced and moderated by the  Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, Government of India Prof. K.  Vijay Raghavan and the second by the Deputy Chairman, Nobel Foundation  Dr Goran K Hansson. Several students and Scientists posed interesting  questions to Nobel Laureates.   Dr. Venkatraman Ramkrishnan pointed out  that there is a lot of scope for research on vaccines in India. Dr.  Richards Roberts pointed out that 125 Nobel Laureates have signed in  favor of Genetically modified food crops and that opposition against  them is unjustifiable as about 800 million people world over go without  food every night. Dr. Randy Schekman said that India with a history of  having had Nalanda University over 1000 years before the first  university in other parts of the world should think of having a high  quality affordable education system. The Laureates said that they shared  their ideas with the Prime Minister at a dinner meeting that they had  with Shri Narendra Modi on Monday evening. 
The dialogue is part of the Nobel Prize Series, India 2017, formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, on 09th  January. The Nobel Prize Series Science Exhibition, also inaugurated by  the Prime Minister at the Science City in Ahmedabad is meanwhile  attracting large number of people. The five week long Science Exhibition  being set up by the Nobel Foundation, with exhibits from the Nobel  Museum, Stockholm, Sweden.

It had several interesting exhibits including the one  mentioned by the Prime Minster yesterday about finding of the LED bulbs,  in his speech while inaugurating the Nobel Prize Series, India 2017 http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=156268

As  a run-up to these events, a nationwide Ideathon contest was organised  that invited ideas from students that could address any challenges faced  by society. The ideas were reviewed by a panel of experts and about 150  students from across the country were selected and have been invited to  participate and meet with the Nobel Laureates.  
A  Memorandum of Understanding was signed last year by Nobel Media and the  Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology,  Government of India for hosting Nobel Prize Series in India for the next  five years.
After  this agreement, a trilateral Memorandum of Understanding was signed  between the Department of Biotechnology of Government of India, the  Government of Gujarat and the Nobel Media. Accordingly, the first of the Nobel Prize Series, India 2017 is being held as a prelude to Vibrant Gujarat to  demonstrate how science and discovery underpins all enterprise and  human well-being under the overall theme of “Science Impacts Lives”. 
As a part of the Nobel Prize Series, India 2017 lectures are also to be held in Delhi and Bengaluru on 12th and 13th January, 2017.

Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, Minister of State, Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, inaugurated the state- of -the -art exhibition display of Sagarmala, Ministry of Shipping at Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors Summit, 2017, today. The central focus of the 8th edition of the Global Summit organized by Government of Gujarat is “Sustainable Economic and Social Development”.
Gujarat  has been at the forefront of the maritime development in India. Under  the Sagarmala Programme, More than 40 projects with estimated cost of  approximately INR 85,000 Crore have been identified across the four  pillars of Port Modernization & New Port Development, Port  Connectivity Enhancement, Port-led-Industrial Development and Coastal  Community Development
A)    Port modernization:   Projects have been identified for capacity augmentation at existing  ports especially Kandla to meet the future growth in cargo volumes.  These include mechanization of cargo handling process, development of  multi-purpose berth and setting up of barge and coastal jetty to name a  few. 
b)     Port connectivity: For  enhancing port-connectivity to hinterland and creating optimal mode of  evacuation to/from ports connectivity projects have been identified.  These include
·     Port- rail connectivity projects including  connection of western DFC to Hazira, Pipva & Mundra; providing  broad Gauge Rail linkages to Old Bedi Port and other internal rail  connectivity projects for Kandla port.
·      Port-road connectivity projects like  constructing alternative road from Bhavnagar to Sosiya - Alang Ship  Recycling Yard and other internal port road connectivity projects
·      Freight expressway:  connecting Sarkhej in Ahmedabad to Mundra and Pipvav
·      Expansion of Salaya Mathura Pipeline
C) Port led- industrialization: To  leverage the ports for aiding industrialization and facilitating export  oriented manufacturing in the state 7 projects have been identified.  These include:
·         Building  major industrial clusters like petrochemical cluster, Cement cluster,  an export based apparel cluster in Saurashtra; an auto cluster in  Sanand; a marble based furniture hub in Kutch and a Maritime cluster in  Gujarat
·         Development of a coastal economic unit (CEU) at Kandla
D) Coastal community development: To ensure sustainable socio-economic development in the  State, projects have identified for development of coastal community.  These include:
·         Development of Gujarat Maritime University
·         Dredging of Ro – Pax Ferry Services between Gogha and Dahej in Gulf of Cambay
·         Training Program for skill development/capacity building of workers involved in ship recycling activities at Alang
·         Dedicated coastal berth for passenger/cargo by sea at Porbandar Port
 
Sagarmala, an initiative  taken by the Ministry of Shipping is one of the strategic plan to  promote port led development in India.  It aims to leverage India’s  7,500 km long coastline, 14,500 km of potentially navigable waterways  and strategic location on key international maritime trade routes.  Sagarmala will also boost development of coastal economy, save logistic  costs, balance modal mix for cargo movement, leading to growth in  manufacturing sector and facilitating ease of doing business.

The best of Skill Development & Entrepreneurial efforts were on  display at the Republic Day parade. The 68th Republic Day was the first  outing for a MSDE tableau. And the outstanding efforts by its creators  helped it being adjudged the best tableau amongst Ministerial  representations. From imparting skill to drivers, technicians,  beauticians, to photographers, carpenters and chefs showcasing the best  state of the art ITI classrooms, the MSDE tableau was created to  highlight efforts in imparting the best of skill development to the  people of India.
The credit for this novel idea to represent MSDE at the Republic Day  parade goes to the Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship  Shri Rajiv Pratap Rudy.  The Skill India Tableau was an effort to  showcase Skill India program’s initiatives. The Minister had taken the  regulation and the monitoring of the tableau as his personal onus and  was monitoring its making on a daily basis. He had been personally  visiting the Rashtriya Rangshala in the Delhi Cantonment area giving his  inputs for the tableau.
According to Shri Rudy tableau was an attempt to portray skill  initiatives by the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship  to make Indians ready for job opportunities. MSDE made an effort to  display flagship programs like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna  (PKKVY), Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) and ITIs. Since the  inception of MSDE, there has been a constant effort in trying to reach  out to the masses and let skilling be aspirational. It has been observed  that since last two years many youngsters have been associated with our  skilling and training initiatives.
While inspecting the tableau, the  Minister had given a vision that  through this tableau Ministry would try and give an overall view of the  different opportunities which MSDE has to offer to the youngsters of  this country. There is an attempt to make skilling aspirational and  create an ecosystem which would provide quality skill education in the  country. MSDE is trying to cater to the aspiration of a modern vibrant  competitive workforce. The Ministry tried to exhibit a skill ecosystem  that will be strengthened and modernised in line with the current  scientific and industrial development in the country.
Minister  Shri Rajiv Pratap Rudy congratulated that entire team which  worked hard to make their Republic Day outing a memorable and proud  moment.

                The Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation have released the First Advance estimates of national income at constant (2011-12) and current prices, for the financial year 2016-17. These are presented in Statements 1-4. 
 
2.         The First Advance Estimates of GDP have been released in accordance with the release calendar of National Accounts@. The approach for compiling the advance estimates is based on benchmark-indicator method. The Sector-wise estimates are obtained by extrapolation of  indicators like (i) Index of Industrial Production of first 7 months of the financial year, (ii) financial performance of listed companies in the private corporate sector available upto quarter ending September, 2016 (ii) 1st advance estimates of crop production, (iii) accounts of  Central & State Governments, information on indicators like sales tax, deposits & credits, passenger and freight earnings of railways, passengers and cargo handled by civil aviation, cargo handled at major sea ports, sales of commercial vehicles etc. available for first 7/8 months of the financial year. The salient features of the estimates are detailed below: 
 
A.                ESTIMATES AT CONSTANT (2011-12) PRICES
 
Gross Domestic Product
 
3.        Real GDP or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant (2011-12) prices in the year   2016-17 is likely to attain a level of  `121.55 lakh crore, as against the Provisional Estimate of GDP for the year 2015-16 of `113.50 lakh crore, released on 31st May 2016. The growth in GDP during 2016-17 is estimated at 7.1 per cent as compared to the growth rate of 7.6 per cent in 2015-16.
 
Gross Value Added (GVA) at Basic Prices
 
4.         Real GVA, i.e, GVA at basic constant prices (2011-12) is anticipated to increase from `104.27 lakh crore in 2015-16 to `111.53 lakh crore in 2016-17. Anticipated growth of real GVA at basic prices in 2016-17 is 7.0 percent against 7.2 percent in 2015-16.
 
5.         The sectors which registered growth rate of over 7.0 percent are, 'public administration, defence and other services’, 'financial, real estate and professional services' and ‘manufacturing’.

Agriculture
 
6.         The ‘agriculture, forestry and fishing’ sector is likely to show a growth of  4.1 per cent in its GVA during 2016-17, as against the previous year’s growth rate of 1.2 per cent. The GVA estimates of this sector have been compiled using the First Advance Estimates of production of major Kharif crops for 2016-17 and targets based on rabi sowings. According to the information furnished by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC), the production growth of  food grains  during  the  Kharif  season of agriculture year 2016-17 was 8.9 percent as compared to decline of 3.2 percent during the same period in 2015-16.  In  case of livestock sector, estimates of production, mainly in the form of targets are available for milk, egg, and wool, from the Department of Animal Husbandry, Ministry of Agriculture. Around 39.0 percent of GVA of this sector is based on  livestock products, forestry and fisheries, which registered a combined growth of above 3.7 percent in 2016-17.

                Attention is invited to some media reports quoting Union Steel Minister, which give an impression that that Minimum Import Price on steel will be discontinued after 4 Feb. 2017.
 
In this connection, this is to clarify that the Minister was making a point in a wider context of providing level playing field to the Indian steel industry. Chaudhary Birender Singh had emphasized that MIP is a short-term measure & not of a permanent nature. The Government is taking permanent measures to counter unfair trade practices as per international norms. A total of 124 steel products have been covered by provisional anti-dumping duties & final orders on the same are expected in due course.
 
As a result of the safeguards and anti-dumping measures, out of 173 items on which MIP was initially imposed, only 19 items are currently notified under MIP. These are relating to colour-coated steel, primarily to avoid any circumvention of the duties. Two of colour-coated steel items are already covered under anti-dumping duties.

The  First Meeting of the National Steel Consumers’ Council will be held  tomorrow under the Chairmanship of the Union Steel Minister Shri  Chaudhary Birender Singh in Mumbai. The function of the Steel Consumer  Council is to advise Government on matters relating to supply,  availability, quality and the market trends of iron and steel.
This  meeting would be attended by representatives of various ministries,  several industry associations, producers and consumers of iron &  steel Industry, house builders and related industries, industry experts  and steel makers including SAIL, RINL and TATA Steel etc. This meeting  would provide a vibrant platform to discuss the domestic steel industry  scenario, the global steel trends, and benefits of using steel and on  how to boost the domestic steel consumption. India has become the third  largest steel producer in the world; while the domestic steel  consumption remains at only 60 Kgs per capita. 
There  has been continued thrust from the Ministry of Steel to boost domestic  steel consumption by exploring the versatile steel uses. Recently the  Steel Minister has also urged all concerned ministries to use India-made  steel for government projects. The meeting comes at a good time to  address all steel related issues.

 ‘Swachhta Pakhwada’ was observed in the Ministry of Steel from January 1-15, 2017.  During this period, as per action plan the office premises of the Ministry were cleaned and spruced up.  Two participatory events, viz. (i) poster competition and (ii) essay competition on the topic of Swachhta have been organized in the Ministry during this period. The Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh reviewed the ‘Swachhta Pakhwada’ activities and praised the Ministry officials and the PSUs management for the Green Environment and Cleanliness activities undertaken during the fortnight and advised them to keep up the momentum ongoing throughout the year.
All the CPSEs in the Ministry of Steel have also undertaken Swachhta Activities in their plants, mines, factories and campuses including residential areas.  In addition, they have been specifically requested to undertake work relating to-
(i)          Removal/ reduction of slag; 
(ii)        Removal/ reduction of iron ore fines; and 
(iii)       Recycling of gaseous waste in power generation.  
These activities will constitute their Swachhta Action Plan for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19.  The Steel Ministry is planning to study and encourage innovative ways to dispose above-mentioned wastes in productive and environment friendly manner, as per ‘Waste to Wealth’ concept by seeking necessary budgetary allocation for this purpose.
During the ‘Swachhta Pakhwada’, various plants of SAIL, RINL and FSNL have undertaken the work relating to disposal of above mentioned wastes.   They have removed/ utilized 323782 tonnes of slag, 402793 tonnes of iron ore fines and recycle gaseous waste to the tune of 127266400 NM3 / hour.

                The first ever “Investors Summit” exclusively for North Eastern Region (NER) would be inaugurated by the Union Textiles Minister, Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani in Shillong, on 29th January, 2017. Focussed on manufacturing in textiles and allied sectors, the North East Investors Summit 2017 is being organized jointly by the Ministry of Textiles and the Ministry of DoNER of the Government of India, in collaboration with industry associations FICCI and CII, on 30-31 January, 2017 at Shillong. The theme being “Exploring Opportunities in North East Region”, the summit aims to showcase the NER as a global destination for investment, and to explore the possibility of bringing in convergence of efforts of various central Ministries and North Eastern States to attract investment in NER.

 
 
 
The Summit will be attended by all North Eastern States, industries from North Eastern Region and leading investors across the country. It is expected to unlock the huge potential of the NER in textile manufacturing and generate new avenues for employment in the region.
 
The Union Minister for DoNER, Dr. Jitendra Singh; Chief Minister of Meghalaya, Shri Mukul Sangma; Minister of State, Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju; Minister of State, Textiles, Shri Ajay Tamta; Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog, Dr. Arvind Panagariya, and other dignitaries would also attend the summit.
 
The event will showcase the unique opportunities in textile manufacturing that the NER offers to the business world. It is expected to usher in a new era of collaboration, not only for investments but also for new skills and advanced production technology. The states of the NER would put up exclusive stalls and make presentations on investment opportunities in textile manufacturing in these states. The summit will have focussed sessions on Showcasing Opportunities in Textiles in North East, Entrepreneurship Development and Start-ups, Enhancing Reach of North East Textiles through Textile Design and Marketing, Ease of Financing of Textiles Industry in North East and Improving Infrastructure in NER. Various MoUs between industry bodies and state governments are expected to be signed during the summit, which would promote investment and boost manufacturing in the region. Buyer-Seller meets and exhibitions would also be held on both days of the summit.
 
Background


North Eastern Region has huge potential for investments, particularly in the field of textiles and handicrafts, due to its inherent strength for skilled work force and locally available raw materials. Ministry of Textiles is implementing projects worth Rs. 1,050 crore for handlooms, handicrafts, sericulture, apparel & garmenting, technical textiles etc. in the eight states of North Eastern Region, in line with the “Act East” policy of the Government.
 
These projects have created a foundation for further growth of manufacturing in textile sector. Other line Ministries too have schemes, where various incentives/ concessions are available for investments in NER. However, this information is mostly in silos and does not provide a comprehensive picture to the investors about the opportunities in North East. The Investors’ Summit seeks to address this concern as well.
 
The decision to hold the summit was announced by the Union Textiles Minister, Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani, at the Annual Conference of State Textiles Ministers, held in New Delhi, on 10th November, 2016.

First ever profile of Father of Nation, his Samadhi, 30 Amrit Vachans  at Rajghat
Solar Power Project, 104 aesthetically designed poles with LED  lights, CCTV Control Room to be inaugurated on Gandhiji’s death  anniversary tomorrow
Special edition of Rajghat Samadhi Patrika to be released commemorating 100th year of Champaran Satyagrha
For  more than 10,000 domestic and foreign visitors who visit Mahatma  Gandhiji’s Samadhi at Rajghat in the national capital every day, there  is nothing much to engage the visitors about his life and and thoughts  other than the black stone platform that marks the spot where Gandhiji  was cremated. To address this deficiency and to enhance the engaging  experience of the visitors, the Rajghat Samadhi Samiti, under the  Ministry of Urban Development has undertaken several initiatives during  the last two years and they will be inaugurated tomorrow on the occasion  of the 69th death anniversary of the Father of the Nation.  These initiatives come 15 years after last such major improvement works  at Rajghat.
For  the first time, a 157 word brief profile of Mahatma and a 131 word  description of Gandhi Samadhi have been put on display, both in Hindi  and English,  at all the three gates of Rajghat.
The  profile says Mahatma espoused “Truth, Non-violence, Sarvadharma  Samabhava, Gram Swaraj, Trusteeship and Swadeshi which are the building  blocks of a new social order free from all kinds of exploitation,  discrimination and domination”.  Profile on Rajghat says “ The Samadhi reflects the simplicity of Father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi’s life”.
30  Amrit Vachans (eternally relevant thoughts of Gandhiji) have been  engraved on marble and displayed on granite stone pedestals for  inspiring the visitors to Rajghat. These include-“Innumerable are the  names of God; but if a choice were to be made of one, it would be Sat or  Satya, that is Truth. Hence, verily Truth is God”, “He who is unable to  rule over self, can never really succeed in ruling over others” and “He  who is truly clean within, can not remain unclean without”.  These  pedestals have been designed to merge with the ambience and  architecture of Rajghat and each pedestal illuniated by LED light atop  aesthetically designed light post.
All  the existing conventional lights at Rajghat Complex have been replaced  by energy efficient and environment friendly LED lights and are placed  atop 104 aesthetically designed poles replacing the old ones. These LED  lights result in energy saving of 60,000 KWH annually. Solar panels have  been installed above roof tops and cycle shed at the parking area of  Rajghat that will generate 52 KW of energy.
For  enhanced security and better monitoring of visitors, 27 CCTV cameras  have been installed with a Central Control Room for monitoring.
Besides  inaugurating these new initiatives tomorrow i.e January 30, 2016,  Minister of Urban Development Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu will also release a  special edition of Rajghat Samadhi Patrika, commemorating the 100th year of Champaran Satyagraha launched by Gandhiji.
Other major initiatives taken up  and  executed during the last two years include; setting up of Kasturba  Gandhi Souvenir Store in the parking area for making available souvenirs  related to Gandhiji at reasonable prices, Landscaping, regressing,  improvement of water bodies and plantation, Laying of Cobbled Stone on  the road between parking area of Rajghat and Samadhi to regulate speed  of vehicles, setting up of CISF Control Rooms near the main gates and  equipped with modern gadgets like DFMD, X-ray machines etc.
A two day  International Seminar was held by the Rajghat Samadhi Samiti in  March, 2015, the first of its kind on the theme “Clean and Capable India of Gandhi’s Dream” .  A  quarterly ‘Rajghat Smadhi Patrika’ was launched on this occasion by the  President Shri Pranab Mukherjee and since being published by the  Rajghat Samadhi Samiti chaired by the Urban Development Minister, to  spread Gandhian thoughts. A nine day ‘Manas Rajghat Katha’ by Shri  Morari Bapu was also organized last year, again for  the first time.
The  last Rajghat improvement works were initiated during 1999-2000 by the  then Minister of Urban Development Minister Shri Jagmohan and his  successor Shri Anant Kumar. These works include relaying of pathways and  parikrama, construction of compound wall on Western and Southern sides,  renovation of water lagoon, redesigning of the entrances and gate on  ring road side, development of shallow water body with fountain,  development of separate parking area etc.

            Ministry of Urban Development has taken a serious view of delay in execution of projects in the National Capital Region that were extended financial support by the NCR Planning Board. Conveying this to the member States, Shri Rajiv Gauba, Secretary(Urban Development) made it clear that  further sanction of loan support would be based on progress on projects extended such support in the past. 
            Chairing a meeting of the Project Sanctioning and Monitoring Group here today, Shri Gauba directed review of the loan sanctioned for the Rs.100 cr ‘Construction of Multi-storied office building at Kakardooma institutional area’ in East Delhi for cancellation on account of lack of any progress since the sanction of first instalment of Rs.20 cr loan in 2013. 
            Haryana Government was also told that NCRPB support for various infrastructure projects would be considered only after the long pending issues relating to ADB funded road projects sanctioned in the past were resolved. 
            The Project Sanctioning and Monitoring Group informed the Haryana Government that loan assistance of Rs.168 cr sanctioned for the Rs.223 cr Manesar Water Supply Project would be reviewed if project works were not started at the earliest. The first instalment of Rs.31.13 cr was released for this project in March last year and the Haryana State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation has not submitted any progress report so far. The Group also declined to consider loan of Rs.270 cr as sought by the Haryana Metro Rail Transport Corporation for extension of Metro Link from Mudka to Bahadurgarh stating that it was not in conformity with the original financing plan. 
            The Project Sanctioning & Monitoring Group of NCR Planning Board today approved financial assistance of Rs.1,664  cr for various infrastructure projects costing a total of Rs. 2,377 cr. 
            Approvals include Rs.1,098 cr for Rejuvenation of Amanishah Nallah (Dravyavati River) including area development in Jaipur city based on the concept of watershed rehabilitation, flood prevention, pollution treatment and landscaping. Another Rs.379 cr was sanctioned for six Road Over Bridges at level crossings at Goner Road, Jhotwara, Sitapura, Bassi, Jahota and Road Under Bridge on Jaipur –Sikar line at Bridge No.107 to address traffic congestion issues at railway level crossings.
            Rs. 187 cr has been approved for the Elevated Road from Sodala Tri-junction to LIC Office near Ambedkar Circle. This 3 km long elevated stretch is a part of NH-11 which will facilitate vehicular movement in the East-West direction of Jaipur and provides a high capacity corridor helping in decongestion of the central areas. 
            Shri Gauba has asked Rajasthan and Jaipur City Governments to ensure promotion of non-motorised transport including cycling and pedestrianisation under Comprehensive Mobility Plan of the pink city which is being developed as a smart city. 
            With today’s approvals, NCR Planning Board has sanctioned over Rs.4,500 cr of financial assistance for infrastructure development in NCR during the last two years.

                The  Minister for Urban Development, Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation  and Information & Broadcasting Shri Venkaiah Naidu says urban  renaissance is taking place in India now as the country is on move now  towards unprecedented development. He was addressing a conference on  Smart and Livable Cities at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in Gandhinagar,  Gujarat today. He said, even while government focuses on urban  development, as about 65% of GDP comes from cities being engines of  growth, it wants to benefit poor in the process. In the initial stage  government identified 100 cities. Developmental work in sixty of them,  including in Ahmedabad and Surat is going on at a fast pace now. He said  Ahmedabad with an AA rating and Surat also with high ranking have  already put Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) in place for taking forward  this work.  He said work is also expected to begin soon in four more  cities in Gujarat including in Gandhinagar and Vadodara. The minister  said that work on the 1st phase of Metro rail project in Ahmedabad,  which would be of about 32 kms, is in full swing with an investment of  about 11 thousand crore rupees. It is expected to be completed by 2018.  Presently in 31 cities with over 20 lakh population, the metro rail  projects are being implemented and cities with over 10 lakh population  will be taken up later.  Shri Naidu said his government in future would  also like select 500 more cities with populations over one lakh people  under smart city programme. He said for such a programme to continue  without any hindrances, the government had adopted the system of having  the SPV system, for which an allocation of Rs 500 crores was made. The  idea is to provide people in every city with better facilities-  including clean water, power and better traffic management among others.  He also referred to Schemes of AMRUT cities named after former Prime  Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Heritage cities.
 

 
Shri  Naidu said that the Prime Minister is not for freebies and he wants  ‘peoplism’ - better life to people, instead of populism. He said Gujarat  model had been unique in this respect and all other states including  Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are  adopting such developmental models now. He said the focus is on  Infrastructure development now with an aim to transform urban landscape  with introduction of metro rail, BRTs and separate Cycling tracks etc.  He said, Shri Narendra Modi also intends to bring in a behavioural  change among people and adopt a path of inclusive growth through various  policies like Make in India, Digital India and Clean India, among  others. He pointed out that aspects like the propagation of ideas like  beti bachao and the voluntary surrender of LPG gas cylinders by over one  crore thirty lakh people are all bringing in a psychological  transformation in our society.
 Shri  Naidu referring to de-notification of Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 currency  notes has said that it is like a bitter pill for tackling some ills of  our society. He described this measure as a radical transformative  measure. He said people have shown monumental resilience in the face of  this challenge taken up by the Prime Minister  against the black money. The minister expects this measure to lead to  identification of those who deposited the black money leading to  increased tax base.
 Shri  Naidu said that the Prime Minister is preparing people for a massive  transformation. The announcements by Shri Narendra Modi on interest  rebates for housing loans and recent lowering of interest rates by banks  are expected to lead to everyone owning a house by 2022.
 Pointing  out that most economies have a downtrend currently and India is said to  be the only bright spot. He said every rating agency including Moody’s  is rating India very high now.   He invited Global investors to make  more investments in Gujarat which is a powerhouse of economic growth and  in other states of India. He said Gujarat is very peaceful and  conducive for investments and it also evinces energy, motivation and  inspiration as great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai  Patel, Morarji Desai and Shri Narendra Modi are from this land he added.

This will help them for the  procurement of specified equipment and software for enhancing their  capability to support dam rehabilitation efforts of CWC.

The  Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation  has taken on board selected premier academic and research institutes,  for capacity building in the areas of dam safety through World Bank  assisted Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP).  The scope includes strengthening the testing laboratories, enhancing  analytical capabilities, exposure visits to best global institutions and  on ground exposure to dam safety concerns to the faculty of these institutions. 

DRIP  is assisting rehabilitation of 250 dams in seven States which are  experiencing different levels of distress. Owners of these dams require  technical support for the investigation of site conditions and supporting rehabilitation efforts. The Government of India has decided to enhance the capability of select premier institutes in dam safety areas so that they, in turn,  carry out field investigations at dam sites and provide training and  consulting services to assist the dam owners in their dam rehabilitation  efforts. It is a holistic effort of the Government of India to equip  our national institutions to develop capability and expertise at par  with global institutions in the times to come.

                In its efforts to give corporate push to Namami Gange,  National Mission on Clean Ganga (NMCG), under Ministry of Water  Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation organised a workshop  in New Delhi on Thursday. 
Representatives  from several public sector enterprises, banks and corporates  participated diligently in the workshop on CSR activities for Ganga  Rejuvenation. Not only did participants showed keen interest in  activities being undertaken under Namami Gange programme, major areas of possible co-operation between NMCG and public and corporate sectors were also extensively deliberated upon in the workshop.
The  workshop was attended by representatives from Maharatna, Navratna and  other PSUs - ONGC, Coal India limited, BHEL, GAIL India ltd., SAIL, NTPC  Ltd., Oil India Ltd., Petronet LNG ltd., etc. Stimulating response was  witnessed during interactions with representatives of public and private  sector banks like SBI, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, HDFC,  ICICI, Yes Bank, OBC, UCO Bank etc., who eagerly shared their  enlightening ideas to further the cause of clean Ganga. Over 20 banks  took part in the workshop. Corporate companies like Aditya Birla Group  JSW and Tata Sons also got fruitfully involved in the event and  presented their views. 
Addressing  the gathering, Director General, NMCG, Shri UP Singh delineated various  on-going sewage treatment, river cleaning, bio-diversity and public  participation projects under Namami Gange programme before  shedding light on areas of common interests. Shri Singh, while stressing  on the importance of co-operation from both public and private sector  in achieving success, invited all the participants to share with NMCG  their invaluable ideas and suggestions. Throwing some light on Clean  Ganga Fund, he explained that it is a trust chaired by Union Finance  Minister and was set up in 2014 to harness the enthusiasm of those who  would like to contribute to the conservation of river Ganga.  Contributions to Clean Ganga Fund are a notified CSR activity. 
During  the much productive interactive sessions, especially Q&A, various  companies apprised about their existing CSR activities. Many expressed  their willingness to work with NMCG in this sector and contribute to Namami Gange  activities in five Ganga basin States. A representative from Coal India  Ltd., said: “As part of our CSR activities, we have devised a mechanism  to transform waste generated from flower offerings into fertilizers”.  An association on these lines with NMCG could also be thought upon, the  official added. Some similar CSR initiatives by GAIL (to make fuel out  of plastic waste) and BHEL (construction of bio-toilets) were also  talked about during the workshop, which ended with a promise of optimism  from all quarters.

                The  young will soon beckon the residents and visitors along Ganga to  inculcate clean practises! In what is aimed at generating widespread  awareness on ails of polluting river Ganga, a cadre of thousands of  youths will be groomed as volunteers to be deployed in villages along  the river to raise clean Ganga consciousness among the local dwellers  and visitors. 
The step which is being taken under central government’s flagship Namami Gange  programme emphasizes on using the zeal of the young to engender support  of people from all walks of life in conservation of the river, which  faces rapid contamination from domestic and industrial effluents. 
Nehru  Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS), an autonomous organisation under Ministry  of Youth Affairs and Sports has been entrusted with the task of  building capacities of more than 20, 000 young men and women from Ganga  basin states, so that they can represent Namami Gange programme as “Swachhta Doots”. 
From  over 20,000 informed youth motivators, as many as 50 enthusiastic  spearhead campaigners would be identified and trained for a week. These  ace campaigners will then be asked to lead this army of the young in  their assigned jurisdictions in spreading the message of clean Ganga.  All this will be done in consultation with village youth clubs. 
The  youth, once trained, would exhort and motivate local population and  tourists to refrain from polluting river Ganga. They will be the new  wheels on which clean Ganga awareness campaign would ride. The Swachhta Doots  would not only educate the target audience about the adverse  consequences of polluting Ganga but will also be an asset in providing  information on existing government activities like construction of  toilets, water harvesting and conservation for creation of a  comprehensive database in coordination with National Mission for Clean  Ganga (NMCG), the implementing arm of Namami Gange programme. 
The  project envisages deployment of the youth in 29 districts spanning  about 2,336 villages along the river in Ganga basin States of  Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. One project officer  will be assigned to each district. The project has been approved at an  estimated cost of Rs 10 crore.

Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Sushri Uma Bharti has said that centre is discussing the issue of bringing water into concurrent list with States. Inaugurating the Jal Manthan-III in New Delhi today she said her Ministry is also seriously working on new acts for water use and Ganga. 
 
Deliberating on various issues related to water resources management, the Minister said water user associations are not performing up to the mark in some States. She said, “We may have to take active help from NGOs to strengthen these associations as active and performing water user associations are very important for the success of AIBP-PMKSY”. Underlying the need for peoples participation in Water Resources Management the Minister said there is a need to convert Jal Kranti into Jan Kranti.  
Referring to inter-linking of rivers Sushri Bharti said her Ministry is trying its best to convert the funding pattern of Ken-Betwa Phase-I link from 60:40 to 90:10. She said the Ministry is very much hopeful to start the project in the first quarter of this year itself. The Minister said the project will be completed within seven years. The Minister also referred to Manas-Sankosh-Teesta-Ganga-Mahanadi-Godawari link and called it as “Mother link” of inter-linking of rivers in the country. Sushri Bharti said a section of the people in a particular state are opposed to this link and termed it as political. She said the successful completion of this link would be able to solve the drought and flood problems of the states of West-Bengal, Bihar and Odisha to a great extent. Sushri Bharti said the Damanganga-Pinjal link will be able to meet the drinking water needs of Mumbai upto the year 2060. She also referred to Par-Tapi link and said that on completion this link would be able to meet the drinking water needs of rural tribals of the area.
Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Baliyan, Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation in his address called for more attention on waste water management. He said a large amount of water is wasted in the country and proper management of the same will result into saving of this precious natural wealth.  Shri Vijay Goel, Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation said that there is urgent need to conserve water for future generations. He said it did not occurre to us that this natural resource which was available in abundance could become scarce in future. 
Dr Amarjeet Singh, Secretary in the Ministry referred to the need of common pooling of water resources by farmers. He said we have to fix the accountability of water use to stop its wastage. Shri said there an urgent need to develop a culture to understand the important of water conservation.   
The daylong event has been organized by the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation with a view to have wider consultations among various stakeholders to brain-storm new ideas for solutions to various issues of water sector.
 
About 700 participants comprising Irrigation/ Water Resources Ministers of States/UTs, eminent experts in water sector, representatives of NGOs and senior officers of the Central and State Governments had consultations and discussions on Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, River Basin Management, River Rejuvenation and Ecology, Flood management, Water use efficiency and Participatory irrigation management. The focus was on refining policies of the Ministry to make them more people friendly and responsive to the needs of the states. 
 
It may be recalled that the Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Sushri Uma Bharati has emphasized the need to hold wider consultations amongst various stakeholders engaged in water resource development and management to achieve synergy of water resource development with environment, wild-life and various social and cultural practices. Jal Manthan programmes are being held to achieve this purpose. The earlier Jal Manthan Programmes held in November, 2014 and February, 2016 were hugely successful.

National  Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) will introduce trash skimmers for  surface cleaning of Ganga in six more cities in the first week of this  month. The cities are Rishikesh, Haridwar, Garh Mukhteshwar, Sahibganj,  Kolkata and Navdweep. Urban Local Bodies will be the nodal agency to  monitor this work. State Programme Management Groups (SPMGs) and  Collectorate office will be supervising these works under the aegis of  NMCG at State and district level respectively. 
River  Surface Cleaning (RSC) work was introduce last year in Allahabad,  Kanpur, Varanasi, Mathura-Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh and Patna in Bihar.  Trash skimmers were deployed at the foregoing locations and tonnes of  floating waste was collected and disposed off in a proper manner. This  task was performed under the CSR head and proved to be extremely  effective. In the coming days, more towns will be identified for  carrying out similar activities. 
Namami  Gange programme was launched as a mission to achieve the target of  cleaning river Ganga in an effective manner with the unceasing  involvement of all stakeholders, especially five major Ganga basin  States – Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal.

The Ministry of Women & Child Development, Government of India is   to  form  a National Alliance against   Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation with the aim of developing a comprehensive outreach system  to  engage parents, schools, communities, NGO partners and local  governments (PRIs and ULBs) as well as police and lawyers to ensure  better implementation of the legal framework, policies, national  strategies and standards in relation to child protection and child  rights.In this context, the Ministry hosted a day-long consultation on  16th January 2017 with all stakeholders including Ministries of Home  Affairs, Health and Family Welfare, Electronics and Information Technology, Department of School Education and Literacy,  National Commission for  Protection of Child Rights and  civil society organisations working on the issue at Civil Services Officer’s Institute (CSOI), Vinay Marg, Chanakyapuri, New Delhi.  
          Child  sexual abuse is a multi-layered problem which negatively impacts  children’s safety, health and well being. Research from world-wide  indicates that children’s exposure to violence and abuse is associated  with long-term physical, psychological, and emotional harm. Child abuse  is finding new forms and channels through mobile and digital  technologies. 
Online child  abuse and exploitation amplifies existing forms of offline bullying,  stalking and harassment. It also facilitates the sexual exploitation of  children through the production and dissemination of child sexual abuse  materials and by facilitating the sexual exploitation and trafficking of  children. Online abuse knows no national boundaries. 
Even though India has  a comprehensive legal framework for protection of child rights in the form of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015,  POCSO Act, 2012 along with RTE Act 2009 and recently amended Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2106, there is limited awareness of online risks for children, both among parents and guardian and children themselves,  
However, to ensure  protection of children from online sexual abuse, all  stakeholders  must work together. In this context, the National Alliance on Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation  has the following broad objectives: 
                   I.            Bring a common definition of child pornography including amendment of acts (Information technology Act, POCSO Act). 
                II.            Set  up a multi-member secretariat based in MWCD with a portal inclusive of a  hotline for reporting and strengthening existing service delivery  systems. 
             III.            Provide a platform for  Government/ NGOs and other child rights activists  for  networking and information sharing. 
            IV.            Document and showcases success stories and best practices in terms of prevention of  online abuse and exploitation of children. 
               V.            Inform and educate member organisations, parents, teachers, front line service providers and children  on the rights of the children and various issues related to online child abuse and exploitation. 
            VI.            Provide a forum for advocacy for child rights and policy inputs  based on  research and studies

 Adoption Regulations, 2017 framed by ‘Central Adoption Resource Authority’ (CARA) as mandated under section 68 (c) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015  has been notified on 4th January 2017  by the Government Press and the Regulations shall be effective from 16 January 2017.

The Adoption Regulations have been framed keeping in mind the issues and challenges faced by CARA and other stake holders including the Adoption Agencies & Prospective Adoptive Parents (PAPs). This will further strengthen adoption programme in the country by streamlining the adoption process. Transparency, early deinstitutionalisation of children, informed choice for the parents, ethical practices and strictly defined timelines in the adoption process are the salient aspects of the Adoption Regulations.
 
Salient features of the Adoption Regulations, 2017:-
 
a)                  Procedures related to adoption by relatives both within the country and abroad have been defined in the Regulations.
 
b)                  Validity of Home Study Report has been increased from two to three years.
 
c)                  The time period available to the domestic PAPs for matching and acceptance, after reserving the child referred, has been increased to twenty days from the existing fifteen days.
 
d)                 District Child protection Unit (DCPU) shall maintain a panel of professionally qualified or trained social workers.
 
e)                  There are 32 Schedules annexed to the Regulations including model adoption applications to be filed in the Court and this would considerably address delays prevalent in obtaining the Court order.
 
f)                   CARA shall be facilitating all adoptions under the JJ Act, 2015 through Child Adoption Resource Information & Guidance System (CARINGS) and all kinds of adoptions, including adoptions by relatives shall be reported to CARA which would enable safeguards for all adopted children by maintaining their record and ensuring post adoption follow up.

Government  of India is committed to ensure that every woman attains optimal  nutritional status – especially from the most vulnerable communities as  nutrition constitutes the foundation for human development.  This is all the more important during the period of pregnancy and lactation coupled with wage loss.  A woman’s nutritional status has important implications for her health as well as the health and development of her children.      
 
An  under-nourished mother almost inevitably gives birth to a low birth  weight baby. When poor nutrition starts in-utero, it extends throughout  the life cycle, particularly in women.  Owing  to economic and social distress many women continue to work to earn a  living for their family right upto the last days of their pregnancy.  Furthermore,  they resume working soon after childbirth, even through their bodies  might not permit it, thus preventing their bodies from fully recovering  on one hand, and also impending their ability to exclusively breastfeed  their young infant in the first six months.
 
To  address the above issues, Ministry of Women and Child Development, in  accordance with the provisions of Section 4(b) of National Food Security  Act, formulated a scheme for pregnant and lactating mothers called  Maternity Benefit Programme – a conditional cash transfer scheme.  The Scheme provides  cash incentives to pregnant and lactating women (i) for the wage loss  so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery; (ii)  to improve her health and nutrition during the period of pregnancy and lactation; and (iii) to breastfeed  the child during the first six months of the birth, which is very vital for the development of the child.
 
Under the scheme, all Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers (PW&LM), excluding  the Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers who are in regular employment  with the Central Government or State Governments or Public Sector  Undertakings or those who are in receipt of similar benefits under any  law for the time being are eligible. The cash incentive of Rs.6,000/-  is payable in three instalments for the first two live births at the following stages:

Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on 31.12.2016 has announced pan-India expansion of MBP in all the districts with effect from 01.01.2017.  It is expected that annually about 51.70 lakh beneficiaries would avail of the benefit.
Expansion of MBP will have huge impact on the PW&LM as it will not only provide them compensation for the wage loss but will also provide them adequate nutrition and rest before and after delivery.  Mothers will have sufficient time to breastfeed the child during first six months of the birth.  Resultantly, it is expected that it will reduce mother mortality rate, IMR, under-nutrition and its adverse effects.
It  is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the cost sharing between Centre and  States is 60:40 for all the States and UTs (with legislature), 90:10  for NER and Himalayan States and 100% GoI share for UTs without  legislatures.  The total cost of  the proposal for the balance period of 2016-17 and from 2017-18 to  2019-20 including Centre and State share is expected to be Rs. 12,661.00  crore.   Out of this, Government of India’s share for the balance period of 2016-17 (Rs. 584 crore) and from 2017-18 to 2019-20 (Rs. 7348 crore) is expected to be Rs. 7932 crore.
Detailed guidelines for implementation and monitoring of the scheme will be issued shortly.

Minister  of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports, Shri  Vijay Goel, has stressed the need for promotion of sports for all round  development of the society. He was addressing the inaugural session of a  3-day Conference of Central and State Ministers and Secretaries of  Sports & Youth Affairs, tourism and culture in Kutch, Gujarat today.  He said that promotion of sports and games among youth will improve  their fitness level which may reduce our health expenditure.  Similarly,  sports can lead to promotion of tourism. If youth are involved in  sports and games related activities, they will not be inclined towards  crimes.  Hence, Shri Vijay Goel,  stressed upon the need for giving maximum encouragement to sports and  games in coming years. He said that various skills need to be developed  in the field of sports. For this purpose, he has spoken to the Minister  for Skill Development. 
 
Shri  Goel said that a “Sports Talent Hunt Portal” will be launched in next  fifteen days in which videos and particulars of budding and emerging  players could be uploaded so that they could be trained properly.
Shri  Goel stated that Khelo India has been launched with the organization of  National level competitions, which are still being conducted.  Process  of selection of players for Olympics and other events has already  started so that their training could begin at the earliest.  Coordination  meetings with schools and such other institutions, which are  responsible for holding sports events are being held to ensure the best  possible ways for identifying talent.
Shri  Goel agreed with State Ministers of States that sports should be  included in the Concurrent List for which a Note will soon be submitted  to the Cabinet.
Shri  Goel said that as there is a shortage of playfields in our country, the  State Governments should make special arrangements for developing  playfields on the available land.  States  should also formulate a policy regarding the use of playfields existing  in the schools, colleges and institutions in the afternoon.
Shri  Goel said that maximum attention will be paid to sports in schools and  universities and sports should be made an integral part of the school  education.  For this purpose, three meetings have been held with the Human Resource Development Minister.  He  said, ten universities will be short-listed where ‘Centres of  Excellence’ for different sports disciplines will be established.
Shri  Goel said that more Centres of the youth organization namely, ‘Nehru  Yuva Kendra Sangathan’ will be established and slum areas and villages  will be developed.  It will be our endeavour that the youth should participate in some cultural, social or sports related activities.  Programmes will be developed in collaboration with Tourism and Culture Ministries.  ‘National Service Scheme’ will be broad-based and strengthened.  
Maximum playfields will be developed and for this purpose, assistance will be provided by the Centre.  Coaches  will be made available to develop sports. Special training will be  imparted to Ex-International and National players to appoint them as  Coaches.

                A three-day National  Conference of Central and State/UT Ministers and Secretaries of Tourism,  Culture, Youth Affairs and Sports will be held in Kutch, Gujarat from  tomorrow. Hon’ble Prime Minister will deliver the inaugural address  through video conferencing and also interact with the participants at  the end of the conference on the outcomes achieved. 
This will be for the  first time that State Ministers of Tourism, Culture, Youth Affairs and  Sports will be meeting together and that too at a place like Kutch.
The Conference aims at  achieving the necessary convergence among tourism, culture, youth  affairs and sports and synergy between the Central Government and the  States/UTs. It will also attempt to draw up an action plan for  utilization of sports facilities for promoting Tourism, Culture and  Youth welfare. 
The Conference will also discuss sectoral issues which have emerged out of the deliberations of the Groups of Secretaries.  Such  sectoral issues relating to sports include integration of sports with  education, bringing sports to the Concurrent List of the Constitution,  strategy for the next three Olympics, setting up of sports science  departments in identified universities, grass-root development of sports  and improving the standard of school competitions and university games.
Convergence of Cultural  aspects with sporting events will create tourist hubs to the mutual  benefit of sports and tourism. The Department of Sports organises  various mega sports events like the recently concluded South Asian Games  in 2016, the forthcoming FIFA U-17 Football World Cup, the Himalayan  Region Sports Festival and the National Games to be held in Goa which  can be showcased along with the culture of the country as well as the  place where the event is being held. Similarly, water sports, aero  sports, adventure sports, etc., can be organised with a firm calender  every year in convergence and coordination with Culture and Tourism  Ministries. 
The Union Minister for  Youth Affairs & Sports, Shri Vijay Goel will address the Conference  on all three days. He has expressed the hope that the convergence  achieved through the Conference will give an impetus to development of  all the concerned sectors.   He pointed out that this would be the second time in three months that the Sports Ministers of States / UTs would be meeting.  The last meeting of the State/UT Ministers for Youth Affairs & Sports was held in New Delhi on 15TH November, 2016.  Shri  Goel said that such frequent interactions are necessary to achieve the  necessary cooperation and coordination between the Centre and the States  for promotion and development of sports in the country.

Government  has decided to revoke the suspension of deemed recognition of IOA with  immediate effect in the light of the corrective action taken by them in  reversing its earlier decision making Shri Abhay Singh Chautala and Shri  Suresh Kalmadi, Life Presidents of IOA. Since IOA has admitted the faux  pas committed and regretted the inconvenience and embarrassment caused  to all concerned, it is expected of IOA that it will uphold the highest  standard of probity and ethics in its functioning in future. 
 In the light  of the above developments and keeping in view the larger interest of  promotion and development of sports in the country, the Minister of  State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has  revoked the suspension of deemed recognition of IOA, imposed on  30.12.2016, with immediate effect.

                 Following is the text of statement of Shri Vijay Goel:
 “I  have seen media reports that Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has  cancelled the appointment of Shri Suresh Kalmadi and Shri Abhay Singh  Chautala as lifetime Presidents of IOA.  I am happy that IOA has reversed its decision which augurs well for governance of sports in the country.  By  reversing their earlier decision, which appears to have been taken in a  hurried manner, IOA has complied with its own constitutional obligation  and also with conditionality approved by International Olympic  Committee (IOC).  In the renewed circumstances, we look forward to partnering with IOA in making India a sporting Nation.”

Minister  of state (I/C) for youth affairs and Sports Shri vijay Goel has said  that the Government under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister, Shri  Narendra Modi  has embarked on the mission of building a united, strong and modern India – “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat”, following the principle of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”.  In  his key note address at the inaugural session of the Youth Pravasi  Bhartiya Divas at Bengaluru today he said that a number of path-breaking  initiatives have been taken and these are exciting times in India.   He said  ‘Make  in India’ campaign has been launched to develop India as a global  manufacturing hub. ‘Digital India’ initiative seeks to transform India  into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. ‘Skill India’  has being launched to impart necessary skills to prepare Indians for the  opportunities in Indian Economy as also the opportunities abroad. A  number of initiatives, including Smart Cities Project, have been  launched for developing infrastructure. ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ and  ‘Clean Ganga’ Mission have been launched for building a clean and green  India. 
The  minister said, the Government is laying great emphasis on promoting  enterprise and innovations, in order to unleash the youth energy and to  put India on the path of high rate of economic growth and employment  generation. ‘Start up India’ campaign has been launched and a very  liberal and attractive policy regime, comprising of tax and non-tax  incentives, has been created to promote start-ups in India. 
Shri  Goel said all these initiatives of the Government require active  involvement and support of all stakeholders. Huge investments will be  necessary. The young Indian Diaspora can play an important role in this  ambitious task of building a modern and prosperous India. The Government  has also taken various steps to facilitate this process by simplifying  rules and procedures for the Overseas Indians.
Shri  Goel said the youth are indeed the most dynamic and vibrant segment of  the population in any country. India is one of the youngest nations in  the world, with about 65% population under 35 years of age. It is  expected that by the year 2020, the population of India would have a  median age of 28 years only as against 38 years for US, 42 years for  China and 48 years for Japan. 
He  said, the Indian Youth have always been highly talented, hard-working  and enterprising. A large number of young Indians have moved to various  parts of the world and have made valuable contributions, earning a good  name for themselves and for the country of their origin. A sizeable  section of Overseas Indian community comprises of highly skilled young  professionals, who have been extremely successful in their respective  spheres of work. Indian IT professionals command respect all over the  world.
Shri  Goel said his Ministry is engaged in the noble task of developing the  personality and leadership qualities of the youth by involving them in  community service and various nation-building activities. This is being  done, inter-alia, through two  youth volunteering organisations, namely, National Service Scheme (NSS)  and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS). NYKS currently has 8.6 million  youth volunteers enrolled through 3.03 lakh youth clubs with presence in  entire rural India and NSS has 3.66 million student volunteers in senior secondary schools and colleges all over the country.  In fact, NSS was started in 1969, the birth centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi had once said “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”.  In the same spirit, the Motto of NSS is “Not Me, but You”. We also have  Rajiv Gandhi National Institute of Youth Development (RGNIYD), which is  our premier institution in the field of youth development.
Shri Goel said, the Overseas Indian youth  willing to make contribution to various social causes can connect to  NYKS, NSS and RGNIYD and work with them to contribute in building a  strong India.

Other dignitaries present at the mela were – Hon’ble Minister of State, Drinking Water and Sanitation Shri. Ramesh Jigajinagi, Hon’ble Member of Parliament – Shri.

He also distributed laptops to top 5 Village Level Entrepreneurs (Uma Farookh of Hassan; Ravi Shankar of Bidar; Kailash of Davangiri; Shivu of Dharwad and Garima of Bengaluru Urban) for their contributions in implementing Digi Dhan Abhiyan.
 
Shri. Ramesh Jigajinagi and Shri. Nalin Kumar Kateel inaugurated the stalls.
Speaking at the event, Shri. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon’ble Minister for Electronics & Information Technology said “Mangalore to Muzzafarpur; Karnataka to Kashmir, India is adding Mobile phones equivalent to the population of France and Italy. India is home to 50 crore internet users, 110 crore UIDAI card holders and we are largest users of Google and Facebook after US. We are transforming India in a big way as there are 25 crore JanDhan accounts which receive direct benefit transfer and in the process Government of India already saved Rs 36000 crore so far.”
 
Hon’ble Minister also said “Terrorism, Maoism and hawala transactions have reduced due to demonetization. To enlarge tax base from 3 crore people to more we require honest and accounted transactions. To create infrastructure, funds for the army, building roads we require money. We have changed laws for Benami transactions, set up SIT to investigate about black money. Today I also made digital payment at Shri Krishna temple at Udupi and at Mukambika temple.”
 
The participants of DigiDhan Mela in Mangalore explained various options available for digital payments to the visitors; they also assisted visitors in downloading and installing various mobile apps for digital payments and helped them in successfully completing one digital transaction. During the event, help was also being extended to citizens for opening their bank accounts, to enroll them for Aadhaar. People could also purchase items of daily needs at the DigiBazar. Hon’ble Minister Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad visited various stalls at the mela, interacted with the students from schools and colleges, participants and also made a cashless transaction at one of the stalls.
 
“Digital India is bringing about a revolutionary transformation in India, making inclusive development a possibility. Around 20 million citizens and over 6 lakh merchants have been trained by the Ministry in digital payment methods since the launch of the DigiDhan campaign. The rapid rate of adoption of digital payments by youth, men and women across all walks of life is an indication of the emergent digital economy.” said Ms. Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY)
 
Digital India outreach campaign started in Karnataka from 8th June 2016 and has covered 9 districts including Bangalore, Bangalore Rural, Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Tumkur, Mandya, Mysore Chamarajanagar and Coorg. Now Digidhan campaign will start from Mangalore and cover Hassan. The campaign will conclude by mid February.
 
The Digidhan campaign one of its kind will travel across districts at pan India level to educate citizens for adopting digital payment modes.
 
The DigiDhan Melas being held across India aims to handhold users in downloading, installing and using various digital payment systems for carrying out digital transactions. The initiative plans to enable citizens and merchants to undertake real time digital transactions through the DigiDhan Bazaar.
 
DigiDhanMela will be followed up by camps organised at state level and at bank branch levels. This Mela is primarily targeted at urban populace and looks to supplement the rural effort of promoting digital payments being led by the Common Services Centres. The Mela is providing free WiFi to enable citizens to download and install mobile apps for aiding on the spot digital payments.

                 The Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’) has imposed penalties on 7 cement companies for bid rigging of a tender floated by the Director, Supplies & Disposals, Haryana, in the year 2012, for procurement of cement to be supplied to Government Departments/ Boards/ Corporations in the State of Haryana. 
A final order has been passed by CCI pursuant to a reference filed under Section 19(1)(b) of the Competition Act, 2002 (‘the Act’) by the Director, Supplies & Disposals, Haryana. 
 CCI has held that the cement companies, through their impugned conduct, have engaged in bid-rigging, in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(3)(d) read with Section 3(1) of the Act, which eliminated and lessened competition and manipulated the bidding process in respect of the impugned tender. The bid-rigging has been established from quoting of unusually higher rates in the impugned tender (than rates quoted in tenders of previous years), determining different basic prices for supply of cement at the same destination through reverse calculation, quoting of quantities in the impugned tender such that the total bid quantity almost equalled the total tendered quantity, quoting of rates for the districts in a manner that all cement companies acquired L1 status at some of the destination(s) etc. The anti-competitive conduct was re-affirmed through SMS exchanged and calls made amongst the officials of the cement companies.  
 Accordingly, penalty of  Rs. 18.44 crore, Rs. 68.30 crore, Rs. 38.02 crore, Rs. 9.26 crore, Rs. 29.84 crore, Rs. 35.32 crore and Rs. 6.55 crore has been imposed upon Shree Cement Limited, UltraTech Cement Limited, Jaiprakash Associates Limited, J.K. Cement Limited, Ambuja Cements Limited, ACC Limited and J.K. Lakshmi Cement Limited. The penalty has been levied @ 0.3% of the average turnover of the cement companies of preceding three years. While imposing penalties, Commission took note of potential delay which would have occurred in the execution of public infrastructure projects due to cancellation of the impugned tender. At the same time, due consideration was given to factors such as peculiarity of the tender process which created uncertainty in procurement, total size of the impugned tender and competition compliance programmes put in place by some companies while determining the quantum of penalty.  
The cement companies have been directed to cease and desist from indulging in the acts/ conduct which have been held to be in contravention of the provisions of the Act. 
 A copy the CCI’s order passed in Ref. Case No. 05 of 2013 has been uploaded on the website of CCI at www.cci.gov.in.

The  Competition Commission of India (CCI) has imposed penalties on three  firms for bid rigging of tenders floated by Indian Railways for  procurement of Brushless DC fans in the year 2013.
A final order has been passed by CCI in a case taken up suo moto under  Section 19 of the Competition Act, 2002 (‘the Act’) based on the  information received from Central Bureau of Investigation, New Delhi.  
CCI has  held that the firms had shared the market by way of allocation of  tenders of Indian Railways for Brushless DC fans amongst themselves  under an agreement/ arrangement and indulged in bid rigging/ collusive  bidding in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(3)(c) and  3(3)(d) read with Section 3(1) of the Act. The anti-competitive conduct  of the firms has been established based on exchange of rates to be  quoted in upcoming tenders amongst the errant firms, numerous calls  amongst the key persons of these firms before and during the period of  the tenders and admission by one of the firms which confirmed and  revealed the existence and modus operandi of the cartel.  
Accordingly,  a penalty of Rs. 2.09 crores, Rs. 62.37 lakhs and Rs. 20.01 lakhs and  was imposed on the firms M/s Western Electric and Trading Company, M/s  Pyramid Electronics and M/s R. Kanwar Electricals respectively in terms  of proviso to Section 27 (b) of the Act. While imposing penalty,  Commission took into consideration all the relevant factors including  the duration of the cartel, volume of the tender affected by the cartel  and value thereof and decided to impose penalty on M/s Pyramid  Electronics and M/s Western Electric and Trading Company calculated at  1.0 time of their profit respectively in the year 2012-13 and on M/s R.  Kanwar Electricals at the rate of 3 percent of its turnover for the year  2012-13.  
Additionally, considering the totality of facts and circumstances of the case,  penalty was also imposed on persons-in charge of the three firms i.e., Shri Sandeep Goyal of M/s Pyramid Electronics, Shri Ashish Jain of M/s R. Kanwar Electricals and Shri Ramesh Parchani of M/s Western Electric and Trading Company at the rate of 10 percent of the average of their income for the last three preceding  financial years.  
CCI had  received an application under Section 46 of the Act read with Regulation  5 of the Competition Commission of India (Lesser Penalty) Regulations,  2009 from M/s Pyramid Electronics. This application was received when  the investigation in the matter was in progress and the report from the  DG was pending.   
Considering the co-operation extended by M/s Pyramid Electronics in  conjunction with the value addition provided by it in establishing the  existence of cartel and the stage at which it had approached CCI, it was granted 75 percent reduction in the penalty than would otherwise  have been imposed, had it not cooperated with the Commission.  Accordingly, the penalty imposed on M/s Pyramid Electronics was reduced to Rs. 15.59 lakhs and penalty imposed on Shri Sandeep Goyal was reduced to Rs. 11,648 only.
